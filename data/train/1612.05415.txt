    "size segregation in granular flow is a phenomenon that has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , only in year 2000 , reverse and intermediate segregations of particles of different sizes and same density were first observed experimentally in granular flows @xcite .",
    "when a few large tracers are flowing with small particles ( size ratio of tracer size on small beads size higher than 4 ) , the large particles do not reach the surface like in classical surface - segregation , but rather stabilise either at an intermediate level ( intermediate segregation ) or at the bottom of the flow ( reverse segregation ) .",
    "this progressive sinking of large beads when increasing their size ratio has been interpreted as a mass effect , being enhanced ( resp .",
    "reduced ) by an increase ( resp . a decrease ) of the density of the large particle @xcite .",
    "let us note that reverse segregation was also obtained in vibrated granular systems @xcite .",
    "the origin of this ` reverse brazil nuts effect ' is due to high amplitude vibrations inducing an inertia driven segregation process @xcite or to the absence of convective motion @xcite .",
    "we define the ` reverse segregation ' in a rotating half filled cylindrical tumbler when large particles are close to the tumbler centre ( taking into account the thickness of the flowing layer ) in the solid rotating part . at the opposite , the large particles having a small size ratio ( from 1.5 to 3 ) end up at the periphery , undergoing a ` surface - segregation ' . for a flow down an incline ,",
    "a fraction of 10% of large ` reverse - segregated ' particles disappear from the surface while flowing , and are present near the bottom of the deposit .",
    "the same phenomenon was observed in the case of a flow feeding a heap : very large particles forming a core in the heap of small particles , instead of a ring of large particles at the periphery of the heap , as in the case of small size ratios @xcite .",
    "we define the ` intermediate segregation ' in the tumbler , when large particles are found at an intermediate radius in the solid rotating part ( fig .",
    "[ tambnath10 ] ) , that corresponds for most of the cases to an intermediate level in the flowing layer .",
    "this happens for size ratios ranging from 4 to approximately 15 , for small fractions of large particles ( 3% ) @xcite .",

    "note that the tracer has almost no effect on this averaging process .",
    "yet , the tracer can deform the loose material below and around it .",
    "we will compare radial positions and positions within the flow of the tumbler whenever it is possible .",
    "for a flow down a solid rough incline , the intermediate segregation is defined when large particles are found at intermediate levels inside the deposit . however , our experiments in the case of the flow down an incline were not precise enough to assess the existence of an intermediate segregation on an incline @xcite . even if the mean location of the large beads in the deposit varies continuously with the size ratio from the top to the bottom , there was a large spatial spreading of the positions for these intermediate levels .",
    "furthermore , this could be related to a non - stationary state of the flow , and/or to the aggradation during the stopping phase of the flow that could modify the position of the tracers .",
    "for that reason , we focus this paper on a numerical study of the reverse and intermediate segregations during flows on incline to gain a better understanding of the phenomena , without any stopping phase .",
    "the existence or non existence of intermediate equilibrium positions for a tracer in a granular flow down an incline is the main question of this article .",
    "therefore , the migration of a unique large tracer in a flow of small particles is first extensively studied for several size ratios , assuming that several identical tracers would flow at the same depth and cluster in a segregation pattern .",
    "the case of several tracers , 5% to 10% , is also considered and compared with the case of one tracer .",
    "it allows a confrontation with previous experiments @xcite made with 10% of tracers .",
    "this article is organised as follows : in the second section , the numerical method is presented . in section 3 , the method is validated in a rotating cylindrical tumbler in two ( 2d ) and three dimensions ( 3d ) through a comparison with 3d experimental results of segregation . in section 4 ,",
    "the displacement of tracers in a granular flow down an incline is studied in 2d , and in 3d .",

    "this will provide a validation for the numerical method and some insights on the process happening during the flow .",
    "the experiments have used glass beads of different diameters and of the same density . in the experimental rotating cylindrical tumbler ( 4.2  cm long and 4.85  cm in diameter ) , only a few ( typically 50 ) large beads , named tracers , were initially placed such that they nearly do not interact .",
    "the diameter of the tracers ( @xmath1 3  mm ) was kept constant while the size of the small particles decreased from @xmath35 2.5  mm to @xmath35 90  @xmath36 m to explore size ratios ranging from @xmath37 to 33 .",
    "the cylinder was half filled with a mixture of large and small beads and was rotated at about 3.6  rpm in order a continuous flow develops with a flat free surface . after three revolutions ,",
    "a stationary state was reached , and tracers had nearly reached identical radial positions leading to a half - ring segregation pattern ( fig .  [ tambnath10](a ) ) .",
    "since each radius in the solid rotating part corresponds to a level during the flow , we interpreted a segregated ring by the fact that all its tracers had the same preferential height within the flow .",
    "the radial segregated position @xmath38 is defined as the mean of all tracers radial positions @xmath39 .    from a numerical point of view , this experimental protocol is not easy to reproduce since the number of small particles increases strongly , reaching 10@xmath40 for the case of 90  @xmath36 m small particles in 2d , and even more in 3d .",
    "first , we will use a model as close as possible to the experimental protocol , but in 2d . in a second time",

    "small standard deviations indicate a strong localisation at the same radius , that corresponds to a segregation since several non interacting tracers would segregate at this same position .",

[ tambnath16_traj ] ) , and a progressive sinking as their size ratio increases .",
    "the agreement between experiments and simulations is good with a similar evolution of the curve of the radial position versus the size ratio , but only qualitative ( fig .",
    "[ tambnath ] ) .",
    "differences exist when comparing 3d experiments and 2d simulations .",
    "( 1 ) in 3d experiments , the decrease of the curve @xmath47 versus @xmath48 is more rapid than in 2d simulations . ( 2 ) in 2d simulations , the asymptotic value of the curve is close to 0.55 , a larger value than the asymptotic value of the 3d experimental case , around @xmath49 .",
    "this 2d asymptotic value will not be reduced for larger size ratios ( fig .",
    "[ tambour_2dfin ] ) .",
    "( 3 ) another difference is observed on the maximum of the curve ( surface - segregation ) , which occurs for @xmath43 1.5 or 1.8 in experiments , instead of @xmath43 2.5 in the 2d simulations ( fig .",
    "[ tambnath ] ) .",
    "we will see that these differences are due to the 2d character of these simulations rather to an experiment - simulation discrepancy .",
    "a longer discussion on that point is made when 3d simulations data are presented .      to reach higher size ratios , the number of particles to simulate needs to be reduced .",
    "several tracer sizes have been tested ( @xmath50 , 4.85 , 6 and 9.7  mm ) in the tumbler @xmath51  mm , and the equilibrium positions @xmath38 reached by the tracers were compared . up to a diameter of @xmath52  mm , equilibrium positions are almost identical . for the larger tracer ( @xmath53  mm , to be compared with the drum diameter @xmath54 ) , a small discrepancy ( relative error of 4% ) was observed in the equilibrium position .",
    "we choose to keep the size of the tracer under @xmath55 to be sure that no effect comes from the tracer size .    a tracer diameter @xmath56  mm is adopted to reach high size ratios up to 60 .    , for 3d experiments ( @xcite ) and 2d simulations , with @xmath574.85  cm and 2 tracer sizes , 3 and 4.85  mm . ]",
    "figure  [ tambour_2dfin ] shows the relative positions of the 3  mm and 4.85  mm tracers , compared to 3d experimental results . when the 2 different tracers have the same size ratio @xmath48 , the resulting positions well superimpose .",
    "for the largest size ratios of these 2d simulations , the radial position slowly decreases but remains close to 0.5 , and does not reach the experimental value of 0.35 .",
    "asymptotic @xmath38 values between 2d simulations and 3d experiments are different .",
    "even if the qualitative behaviour is reproduced , 3d simulations are needed for a precise comparison .        to obtain a quantitative agreement , 3d simulations , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tambour3d6 ] , have been performed .",
    "the tumbler inner - diameter is equal to @xmath58  mm and rotates around the @xmath34 axis . in a first series ( size ratio up to 8) , the tracer diameter is set to @xmath59  mm as in experiments , then for larger size ratios ( from 5 to 25 ) to @xmath60  mm , to reduce the number of small beads simulated .",
    "for size ratios @xmath61 and 8 , both tracers size have been tested .",
    "larger tracers ( @xmath52 and 9  mm ) have also been used to check the sensibility to the tracer size . like in 2d ,",
    "no differences were observed for a 6  mm tracer , and very small discrepancies for 9  mm .",
    ", in 3d experiments and 3d simulations .",
    "dashed line is the position of a tracer touching the bottom of the flow . ]",
    "the equilibrium radius of the tracer ( fig .",
    "[ tambour3dfin ] ) quantitatively agrees with the 3d experimental data .",
    "agreement is very good even on precise points like the slope of the curve , the asymptotic value of @xmath47 for high size ratios , or the diameter ratio which corresponds to the maximum of the radial position @xmath47 .",
    "we are confident in our simulation method to study other systems , as flows on rough inclines .",
    "another question is how to interpret the different values of @xmath47 in terms of segregation within the flowing layer of the tumbler , to anticipate a link between conclusions of the tumbler and the incline studies .",
    "in particular , is the asymptotic low value of @xmath47 a possible reverse segregation ? note that a constant reverse position in the flow would undergo a little decrease of @xmath47 , because with our protocol , the thickness of the layer ( = minimum of @xmath38 ) slightly decreases .",
    "our numerical thickness measurements ( added with a tracer radius ) draw the dashed line ( on fig .",
    "[ tambour3dfin ] ) , i.e. the positions where a tracer touches the bottom .",
    "size ratios 20 and 25 are in reverse segregation , and the small decrease between them is explained .",
    "in addition , in some simulations , we measure the depth of the tracer on its trajectory . for a ratio 8 , ( see below , fig .",
    "[ trajectory4](b ) ) the tracer is at an intermediate level . for the highest size ratios ( for example 20 ) : the tracer is just on the bottom of the flowing layer ( i.e. the tracer bottom passes where streamlines are reduced to the stagnation point , which is nowhere else than the bottom layer centre ) . even if it is difficult to defined the bottom of a flowing layer on a loose and deformable granular matter which could be modified by the tracer itself , we then choose to call ` reversed ' the positions of these highest ratios .",
    "however , we keep in mind that it is arbitrary : the bottom of the flowing layer is defined by an averaging of small beads streamlines , and the tracer passage has almost no effect on the averaging , although it probably deforms locally and during a short time , the granular material around it , when it passes ` at the bottom ' . with that choice ,",
    "the rather central @xmath47 positions ( near 0.35 ) correspond to a tracer at a reverse bottom position within the flow .",
    "the 2d study presents few differences with the 3d case , interpreted as a reduced effect of the size ratio , compared to the 3d case : the maximum of the curve happens later , the slope is less steep , and the asymptotic value is higher .",
    "first , we had to check that the difference 3d-2d is not due to a difference of thickness of the flowing layer , but they have been measured nearly identical , for a given size ratio , in 2d and 3d simulations .",
    "we compare for a size ratio ( @xmath4320 ) the level of the tracer within the flow . in 3d",
    ", the tracer is touching the bottom , while in 2d , the tracer is flowing above the bottom having 6 small beads below it . the delay in @xmath47 positions",
    "does correspond to a delay in depth positions in the flowing layer .    for the highest tracers in 2d ( above 40 )",
    ", we measure that the tracer touches the bottom of the flowing layer ( bottom defined as explained above ) .",
    "thus , they exhibit a reverse segregation within the flow , while being considered in a radial intermediate position .",
    "asymptotic @xmath47 values in 2d are greater than those in 3d , although they both correspond to tracers in reversed position in the flow , with our way to define the bottom .",
    "this remark shows how it is difficult to understand precisely what happens in the flow tumbler , when positions are close to the centre , i.e. close to the loose granular material below the flow . the way that particles pass from static to flow plays a role in the process , role which begins to be important when close to the centre .",
    "obviously , the process is different in 2d and 3d , giving different asymptotic values .",
    "nevertheless , there is a real delay of the evolution of the 2d curve compared to 3d curve ( also on the flow positions , not only on @xmath47 ) , even far from the tumbler centre . to understand the cause of this delay",
    ", one should compare the effective densities of the media made of small particles .",
    "if we note @xmath62 the density of the ( large or small ) beads , the effective density of the granular media made of small beads is equal to @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the compacity . in other words , a large bead is denser than a sphere of the same diameter , but filled with a random close packing of small beads . in 2d , such a packing gives a compacity closed to @xmath65 , while in 3d , @xmath66 .",
    "thus , the density ratio between the tracer and the media is larger in 3d than in 2d , leading to a deeper segregation .",
    "this result was confirmed using tracers of decreasing densities @xcite . for tracers less dense than a random packing media of the small beads , only surface segregation of the tracer was observed .",
    "even if the names of the segregation patterns are arguable , there are similarities but also discrepancies between 2d and 3d cases . in 3d",
    ", the evolution of the position shows an advance of the curve maximum and a steeper dependence with the size ratio .",
    "moreover , the link between level and radius behaves differently for the highest size ratios .",
    "the enhance of the effect of the size ratio is due to the compacity around 0.6 ( in 3d ) or 0.8 ( in 2d ) and we expect that it will always be present in all types of flow .",
    "thus , 2d studies should be taken with care if extrapolated to the 3d case .",

    "the first rotations concern the convergence , when the tracer crosses streamlines .",

    "the tracer initially falls after tumbler have been filled ( vertical line ) , then the rotation starts with the tracer relatively close to the stagnation point . during the first , second , third , and beginning of the fourth passage in the flowing layer , the tracer shows an up motion when compared to the small beads streamlines .",
    "it migrates towards its equilibrium position .",
    "accordingly , in the static zone , from one passage to the following , the radial position @xmath39 increases .",
    "then , after these 4 passages , the trajectory is stationary : the tracer flows parallel to streamlines at each pass , and presents a nearly constant radial position @xmath39 with some fluctuations from turn to turn .",
    "the segregation process happens mainly during the flow , and is not due to processes happening during the entrance and/or the exit from the flowing layer . here ,",
    "the tracer has started from a central position , and the motion is upward to reach its balance level .",
    "it could have been downward if the tracer would have started from the surface .",
    "an equivalent upward motion is observed for a tracer with a size ratio  8 ( fig .",
    "[ trajectory4](b ) ) , but with a smaller amplitude as the starting position is closer to the corresponding equilibrium @xmath47 , than for the ratio  4 case .    once in the steady phase ,",
    "the tracer trajectory and small beads streamlines are parallel in the flowing zone .",
    "there is no relative up or down motion anymore .",
    "plotting a circle of 3  mm on the trajectory , shows that the tracer of size ratio  4 is just below the surface , and that the tracer of size ratio  8 is on intermediate segregation .",
    "each level in the flowing layer corresponds to one radius in the rotating part of the tumbler .",
    "however , the tracer trajectory does not match the same streamlines in the rotating zone and in the flowing zone .",
    "there are two small shifts between tracer trajectory and small beads streamlines when going in and out the flowing layer . at the entrance",
    "[ trajectory4](b ) ) , the tracer starts to move after the small beads of the same streamline ( despite the shift of the previous exit ) , probably because its bottom is still surrounded with non moving small beads . at the exit of the flow ,",
    "the tracer stops before the small beads of its corresponding streamline because its lower part is touching the static curved bottom .",
    "note that this behaviour is the opposite of what happens when large beads segregates at the surface of a flow , where they flow further away than small beads , partially rolling on them .",
    "we conclude that these shifts are not responsible for the segregation , from turn to turn .",
    "but they exist , probably vary with @xmath38 and might be the cause for the discrepancy between 2d and 3d asymptotic values . for that reason ,",
    "it is not possible to easily deduce flowing height positions from both data of streamlines of small particles and @xmath47 . nevertheless ,",
    "if not too close to the centre , these shifts are little .",
    "the @xmath47 variation comes mainly from a level variation within the flowing layer .",
    "when looking precisely , the entrance in the flow induces a starting point slightly above the balance level that the tracer will reach ( fig .",
    "[ trajectory4](a ) ) . at each pass in the flowing layer ,",
    "tracer exhibits a tiny decrease towards its balance level , then keeps a constant level for the end of the flow , parallel to streamlines .",
    "the length at which the constant level is reached ( approximately at mid length for ratio 4 , almost immediately for ratio 8) seems to decrease with the tracer size ( fig .",
    "[ trajectory4 ] ) .",
    "segregation is so fast , that a slight destabilisation can be rebalanced in each flow pass .    in conclusion",
    ", the trajectories study in the 3d cylindrical tumbler shows that the process responsible for the segregated radial positions of tracers is a vertical migration and stabilisation of the tracer at various depths , occuring during the flow .",
    "we then expect a similar phenomenon to happen during a flow on an incline .",
    "in addition , as 3d numerical modeling of tumblers shows a good quantitative agreement with experiments , we are confident to explore the case of the rough incline .",
    "the experimental study of granular segregation occuring in a flow down an incline is a very difficult task to achieve in large channels ( 3d ) .",
    "indeed , in our experimental study , only the surface of the flow was visible .",
    "the volume of the deposit could be accessed after the flow has stopped due to a slope change or a vertical end wall @xcite . for large size ratios ( @xmath69 ) , no tracers were visible at the surface during the flow .",
    "the large particles were found inside the deposit , more or less near the bottom .",
    "but it was not possible to conclude if tracers found at an intermediate height in the deposit were flowing at this level ( corresponding to an intermediate segregation ) or have ended there during the aggradation of the deposit .",
    "the main advantage of the incline geometry is that height measurements of tracers in flows are direct , while measurements of radii in the cylinder , even if they are strongly linked to the height of the tracers during the flow , implies also entrance , acceleration and stop phases .",
    "moreover , the solid rough bottom level of the incline is well defined , which is not the case in a partially filled tumbler where flows pass on loose granular matter , with a curved geometry .",
    "another difference is that the flow thickness in the tumbler is mainly imposed by the geometry ( tumbler and small particles sizes ) . for the chosen protocol ( decreasing small bead size )",
    ", this layer thickness decreases with the size ratio ( around @xmath70 for @xmath71 ; @xmath72 for @xmath73 ; 34@xmath24 for @xmath74 ) .",
    "while for confined flows on incline , the thickness of the flow can be varied independently .",
    "the smallest chosen thickness is comparable to those encountered in non confined flows on incline ( around @xmath75 ) @xcite , and , for this reason , the results on such thin flows do not lack of interest .",
    "the numerical thickness will then be increased to explore the effect of this parameter , and to reach the experimental value of the confined channel for comparison @xcite .",
    "as experimental results were not obtained following any protocol , we choose to kept the small beads diameter constant ( 6  mm ) , and vary the size of the tracer , because to decrease the size of the small beads would have increased the velocity of the flow and the time of calculation , even for a constant flow thickness .",
    "nevertheless , we may expect some deviations between experimental and numerical results if tracer size becomes too large compared to the flow thickness .        even if quantitative agreement is not guaranted , 2d simulations are easy to conduct , allow a large variation of all possible parameters and have shown interesting results in the cylinder .",
    "simulation boxes are 160@xmath24 long , or 300@xmath24 long for the larger tracers .",

    "the up limit of the transition between surface and reverse segregation is experimentally found for 4.3 , and this transition happens between 4.2 and 4.3 numerically for one particle , which is a very good agreement . for 5% of tracers ,",
    "the transition is obtain from 4.2 to 4.7 , as the transition is more progressive , still in very good accordance . but experimental standard deviations of tracers are observed to be large , not only for ratio 4.3 , but for all high size ratios contrary to simulations , even if they decrease for the higher ratios .    ) and for 5% of tracers ( red @xmath84 ) .",
    "the error bars show the standard deviations of the vertical position , but are not representative of the positions distribution of the individual tracers , which are asymmetric : never going upper than the surface or lower than the lowest layer ( see fig .",
    "[ col3710d ] ) .",
    "the thickness of the flow is @xmath113  m. ]    three experiments have been done in the channel , each with a wall to stop the flow at a given distance ( 30 , 60 and 90  cm ) from the start .",
    "tracers are 3  mm , and small beads are 300 - 400@xmath36 m ( size ratio 8.6 ) . in all cases , tracers are found inside with no major change in the segregation pattern .",
    "but the average position of tracers in a slice located at the same distance from the end wall ( for example at 10  cm ) , shows a slight decrease when increasing the length on which the flow propagates .",
    "we conclude , that even if the type of segregation is well established , the convergence to a final average position is still developing when the flow stops .",
    "all our data , established for a 90  cm traveling distance , do not concern a full stationary state . the process takes longer for 10% to get to their final average height than for one particle .",
    "this convergence distance is compatible with those calculated in the simulations , where stationary state is not reached at @xmath129 ( equivalent to 90  cm ) for flows of @xmath130 ( equivalent to 1.3  cm ) ( fig .",
    "[ col3710d ] ) or for very thick flow of @xmath131 ( equivalent to 3.5  cm ) ( fig .",
    "[ colonnex ] ) closer to the deposit thickness .",
    "the values of the standard deviation higher than the numerical ones can be explained by the non full converged state and also by the use of 10% of tracers instead of 5% .",
    "so , the decrease of the experimental average position and the decrease of the standard deviation for high size ratios could be explained by a better convergence towards the reverse segregated position .",
    "this better convergence is compatible with the faster migration of one single particle when increasing the size ratio ( comparing figs .",
    "[ nathh2 ] and [ nath12 ] , or fig .",
    "[ nath10a](b ) ) .",
    "that explains why reverse segregation is experimentally nearly reached for the ratio 44 , despite a too short channel .",
    "m ) and 10% of 3  mm tracers . ]    in the simulations ( figs .",
    "[ col3710d](a ) and [ colonnex ] ) , for traveling lengths corresponding to experiments ( 90  cm=2500@xmath24 ) , tracers above the first layer do not organise in superimposed layers like those obtained at the end of the simulations .",
    "for such a flowing distance , only a first bottom layer is already defined , a second one is in formation .",
    "the other layers are still emerging and have not reached their final height . indeed , in experiments , most slices present tracers organised in a bottom layer ( fig .",
    "[ manipcut ] ) , and sometimes in a second one above , not so well defined .",
    "measurements of this bottom layer height have been done between 15 and 30  cm from the front .",
    "we choose that to avoid the perturbations due to the collision with the end wall , and the local tracers fraction increase near the front . for size ratios from 4.3 to 15",
    ", the bottom layer height is measured from 10 to 11.5@xmath24 ( with a little increase up to 13@xmath24 for ratio 15 , above our simulation parameters range ) .",
    "these values are close to the 9 to 10.2@xmath24 values found numerically for size ratios from 5 to 12 ( fig .",
    "[ nathh1 - 2 ] ) .",
    "even if the stationary stage has not been reached in our experiments , experimental data reproduce well the existence of the bottom layer and its height , the overall transition between surface and reverse segregation , the variation of the associated standard deviations of positions , and the exact ratio ( 4.3 ) for which the transition starts .",
    "the numerical study also shows that , in experiments , large particles ( above the size ratio 5.9 ) that have settled inside , correspond to non converged states of reverse segregation at different degrees of convergence .",
    "simulations and experiments agree to show that the size ratio 4.3 induces an intermediate segregation of the tracers , where the spreading of experimental positions ( obtained for a non fully converged system ) is maximum .",
    "the result is a nearly homogeneous mixture of tracers and small beads .",
    "this experimental spreading all through the deposit comes of course from the quite large ( but smaller ) standard deviation shown by the numerical converged result , combined with the average position at an intermediate level . but longer times of convergence , and effects coming from the increase of the tracer fraction might be also implied in the process .",
    "for that reason , the range of size ratios around 4.3 needs further investigations .",
    "in 3d , the segregated position of a large tracer depends mainly on the size ratio between the tracer and the small beads , and on the type of the flow . in the tumbler ,",
    "a precise study of trajectories has shown that the segregation position is established during the flowing phase and is recorded in the static rotating part .",
    "flow substratum is a loose granular material whose bottom is difficult to define , but trajectories of highest size ratios seem to show tracers at the bottom of the flow .",
    "surface pattern , intermediate segregation with positions going deeper and deeper towards a reverse pattern are observed successively when increasing the size ratio .",
    "the transition between surface and reverse segregations is progressive , allowing a large range of tracers size ratios to be in an intermediate segregation pattern .",
    "for all 3d flows down a solid rough incline , two behaviours are very clear : near the surface , which corresponds to tracers on , or just below the surface ( surface and intermediate segregation ) , and near the bottom ( intermediate and reverse segregation ) , which corresponds to tracers floating inside the flow at , or very close to the substratum .",
    "existence of intermediate segregated positions near half - depth , depends on the configuration of the flow and it seems to be not always present . for thick flows , the transition between the two behaviours is sharp , with no tracers stabilised around mid flows . for thin flows , the transition is progressive and a range of tracers stabilised at positions inside the flow , at every intermediate positions .",
    "we conclude that , in 3d , the tracer position seems to be determined by the type of substratum ( solid , or loose ) , and by the interaction between surface and bottom when they are close enough , as in thin flows .    on 3d inclines ,",
    "the three segregation patterns are observed in the case of multiple tracers flows , with a less sharp transition obtained for the same size ratio ( around 4.3 ) for simulations and experiments . but reverse segregation could be long to establish , and a large spreading of the positions stays during a long travel distance . during this travel",
    ", the flows could be considered as nearly homogeneous , except near their surface , for size ratios above 5 .",
    "the choice of a high size ratio could be an opportunity to keep a mixture homogenous for usual industrial transfers .",
    "further studies are needed to set the precise parameters range where this process can be used .",
    "the case of 2d flows have been studied in tumblers and inclines . compared to the 3d case",
    ", they both show a delay in the sinking of the tracer segregated position when increasing its size ratio .",
    "small size ratios behave in relation to surface position as in the 3d case , even if there is a delay . but for large tracers on inclines , the reverse segregation does not exist anymore , even for the largest size ratios .",
    "tracers stabilise at intermediate positions near mid - flow height , at a position which scales with the flow thickness , contrary to the 3d case . in 2d tumblers ,",
    "the position evolution is also delayed and shifted with a radial intermediate segregation of the largest tracers . however , this radial position does correspond to reverse levels comparable to those of the 3d case , but still with a delay .",
    "the discrepancy between 2d and 3d , probably due to the compacity difference between 2d and 3d , does not affect all the processes implied in the segregation in the same manner .",
    "the highest care should be taken before extrapolating results of studies between 2d and 3d cases .",
