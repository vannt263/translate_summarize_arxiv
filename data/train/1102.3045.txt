    "to be realized , methods need to be developed to predict when a system of polynomial equations or a geometric problem has a lower bound on its number of real solutions , and to compute or estimate this bound .",
    "we developed a theory of lower bounds on the number of real solutions to systems of sparse polynomials  @xcite .",
    "there , a system of polynomial equations was reformulated as a general fiber of a projection map from a toric subvariety of a sphere . when the smooth points of this toric variety are orientable , the absolute value of the degree of this projection map is a lower bound on the number of real solutions . besides giving a condition implying this orientability , a method ( foldable triangulations of the newton polytope ) was developed to compute the degree of certain maps , and a class of examples of polynomial systems ( wronski polynomial systems from posets ) was presented to which this theory applied .",
