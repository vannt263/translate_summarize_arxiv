    "in this paper we revisit the long standing issue of how neutrino flavor mixing in the early universe might affect big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "though this is an old problem @xcite , with the advent of modern experiments ( _ e.g. _ , solar , atmospheric , and accelerator - based oscillation experiments ) we can hope to begin constructing the neutrino mass / mixing matrix . here",
    "we adopt the leading model for this , the two - doublet four - neutrino mass scheme @xcite .",
    "we discuss this mixing in detail , going beyond recent good assessments of this problem @xcite , to examine what bbn considerations _",
    "ultimately _ may be able to tell us about parameters in this mixing scheme .",
    "historical attempts @xcite at constraints on neutrino mixing are based on the argument that an active - sterile neutrino mixing that is too large at ( or prior to ) the bbn epoch will populate the sterile neutrino sea .",
    "the resultant increase in the total energy density of the universe at a given temperature speeds up the hubble expansion . in turn",
    "this leads to a higher weak - freeze - out temperature and , consequently , it could lead to a higher neutron - to - proton ratio at nuclear statistical equilibrium freeze - out @xcite ( however , the neutron - to - proton ratio is determined not only by the expansion rate , see below ) .",
    "since essentially all neutrons are incorporated into @xmath1he in the early universe , such a mixing yields a higher @xmath1he abundance @xmath3 .",
    "this potentially could contradict the observationally inferred primordial @xmath1he abundance . from the inferred abundances of @xmath1he and @xmath4",
    "there are strong constraints on the increase of the predicted @xmath3 from an increased energy density due to sterile neutrino production .",
    "these constraints are often translated into a limit on the `` effective number of neutrinos '' of @xmath5 at 95% confidence that is strictly limited by the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath6 , determined by the inferred relative abundance of deuterium ( @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "this limit is shown in fig .",

    "the observationally - inferred primordial mass fraction we adopt is generous : @xmath10 ( 95% confidence range ) @xcite ; and the inferred relative abundance @xmath7 we adopt is the well - established @xmath11 @xcite . for arguments and observational evidence on the reliability of the deuterium abundance see ref .",
    "similar limits on @xmath8 have been derived by other groups @xcite .",
    "these limits preclude by a wide margin a fully populated sterile neutrino sea ( @xmath12 ) in the bbn epoch .",
    "the concept of @xmath8 ( an expansion rate measure ) as the sole determinant of the @xmath1he yield is a misleading and dangerous one .",
    "a few @xmath13 models have been advanced as simultaneous explanations of the atmospheric neutrino data , the solar neutrino data , and the data from lsnd @xcite .",
    "one hierarchical scheme would have ( near ) maximal @xmath14 mixing for the atmospheric deficit , a @xmath15 mass splitting that gives either a vacuum or msw solar solution , and the lsnd indication of a large @xmath16 is given by `` indirect '' mixing through a sterile .",

    "[ schemes ] . in this scheme ,",
    "the mass states most closely associated with the active neutrinos form a triplet that has a significant mass splitting from the mostly sterile mass state .",

    "the required large mixing amplitudes for @xmath17 and @xmath18 populate the sterile sea in the early universe through direct oscillation production of steriles @xcite .",
    "this mass model is also disfavored by a combined @xmath13 experimental data analysis @xcite .    an alternative two - doublet hierarchical scheme ( scheme ii )",
    "has ( near ) maximal @xmath17 mixing to fit the atmospheric data in super - kamiokande , and @xmath21 mixing explaining the solar neutrino puzzle .",
    "this option is excluded by bbn since the @xmath17 transformation is too large to be compatible with @xmath1he observations @xcite .",
    "( recently foot and volkas @xcite have argued that @xmath22 maximal vacuum mixing for superk atmospheric neutrinos in a related mass scheme _ can _ be reconciled with bbn limits . ) during the bbn epoch , the @xmath17 mixing can be suppressed @xcite .",
    "this assumption must then involve physics that is beyond neutrino mixing . ]    therefore , adopting the previously considered limits from bbn , we are left only with the two - doublet four - neutrino mixing model , scheme iii .",
    "the bbn effects of the model in scheme iii were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we expand on the analysis of the mixing and suggest how bbn could give potentially stricter limits that those found in ref .",
    "( we note here that the `` inverted scheme , '' where the @xmath23 doublet is more massive than the @xmath24 doublet is not yet completely ruled out by laboratory and astrophysical considerations . )",
    "a new twist was added to the saga of neutrino - mixing in the early universe when it was found that resonant active - sterile neutrino transformation in the bbn epoch can alter neutrino energy spectra and generate a lepton number asymmetry@xcite .",
    "this raises the possibility that an asymmetry in numbers could be generated . in the mean time , their energy spectra may be modified so that the weak reaction rates themselves may change , resulting in a different neutron - to - proton ratio and a different @xmath1he yield @xmath3@xcite .",
    "it has been argued that a positive asymmetry behaves like a positive chemical potential for @xmath25 .",
    "this would reduce @xmath3 , and by the same token a negative asymmetry would increase it@xcite . however , this argument of a direct asymmetry-@xmath3 leverage relation is too naive in the context of active - sterile neutrino mixing , and is in fact incorrect .",
    "this is because the process of lepton number generation via resonant active - sterile neutrino mixing potentially has a crucial and unique feature@xcite : that the lepton number asymmetry is first damped to essentially zero and then can oscillate chaotically with an increasingly larger amplitude , until it converges to a growing asymptotic value that is either positive or negative .",
    "however , the existence of `` chaoticity '' ( unpredictability ) in the final sign of the lepton asymmetry , @xmath26 , is controversial .",
    "indeed , _ all _ claims ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) for lepton number generation in the early universe via neutrino mixing are now at odds with at least one calculation ( dolgov , hansen , pastor and semikoz @xcite ) . ref .",
    "@xcite uses a new formulation of the solution of the neutrino energy density matrix evolution that finds a non - chaotic generation of only a small and insignificant lepton asymmetry .",

    "the oscillations in lepton number sign seen in ref .",
    "@xcite only occur below the precision of their numerical solution",
    ". one may call into question then the ability of their numerical formulation to resolve oscillations occuring at larger mixing angles which can be found in the more straight - forward momentum - averaged solution of refs . @xcite .",
    "the momentum - averaged solution is valid at the relevant high - temperatures where the instantaneous approximation to repopulation are good . for the lsnd mass scale in scheme iii",
    "considered here , @xmath27 to 10 ev@xmath28 and a small effective mixing angle ( @xmath29 ) , the bulk of the active neutrinos undergo resonance at a temperature @xmath30 to 20 mev where the instantaneous approximation can be considered valid .",
    "given the controversy and disagreement among these different calculations it is difficult to take any bbn - derived constraint with confidence .",
    "with this caveat in mind , we explore what constraints _ might _ be possible if the lepton number generation magnitude is as in refs .",
    "@xcite , but where chaoticity in lepton number sign obtains for relevant parameters .    in a chaotic lepton number generation regime ,",
    "the sign of the lepton number asymmetry is independent of the initial conditions before the amplification begins , and is exponentially sensitive to the parameters involved during the chaotic oscillitory phase @xcite . in turn",
    ", the sign of the asymmetry can not correlate over a scale bigger than the particle horizon @xcite .",
    "this causal structure of space - time can make it impossible to obtain a universe with a uniform lepton number asymmetry .",
    "instead , the lepton number generating process gives rise to a universe with numerous lepton number domains with similar lepton number magnitudes , albeit different signs @xcite .",
    "the size of each domain is less than the horizon size at that epoch ( @xmath31 cm at the weak - freeze - out temperature , although the detailed geometric structure of the domains at the bbn epoch depends on the manner in which domain `` percolation '' occurs ) .",
    "the distribution of domains with different signs is completely random so that in total each sign occupies half of the space .",
    "the overall primordial @xmath1he yield in such a universe must be an average of @xmath3 over domains with opposite asymmetries .",
    "interestingly , this implies that the overall @xmath3 is always _ larger _ than that expected when there are no lepton asymmetries . this is because the increase in @xmath3 from a negative lepton asymmetry generated by the resonant active - sterile neutrino mixing process is always _ bigger _ than the decrease in @xmath3 from a positive asymmetry generated in the same process@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we examine in detail how this causality effect operates in the context of a _ specific _ four neutrino mixing scheme .",
    "there are some surprises .",
    "we can quantify these arguments for the two - doublet neutrino mixing model ( scheme iii ) . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath32 mixing that fits the lsnd data has a mass - squared - difference @xmath33 to 10 ev@xmath28 and an effective two - neutrino mixing angle satisfying @xmath34 to @xmath35@xcite ; the @xmath18 mixing that solves the solar neutrino puzzle has either @xmath36 ev@xmath28 and an effective two - neutrino mixing angle satisfying @xmath37 for the small mixing angle ( sma ) msw ( mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ) solution or @xmath38 ev@xmath28 and @xmath39 for the vacuum solution @xcite ; the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data are nicely fit by @xmath14 mixing with @xmath40 to @xmath35 ev@xmath28 and @xmath41@xcite .",
    "the hierarchy in masses which emerges from this mixing scheme includes an upper doublet of heavier neutrinos , consisting of ( almost ) degenerate @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and a lower doublet of lighter neutrinos , consisting of slightly mixed ( in the case of the msw solution ) or ( near ) maximally mixed ( in the case of vacuum mixing ) @xmath25 and @xmath44 .",
    "the inter - doublet mixing between @xmath42 and @xmath25 is small .",
    "so also must be the inter - doublet mixing between @xmath42 or @xmath43 and @xmath44 , so as to avoid conflicts with bbn @xcite .",
    "the large mixing angle ( msw ) solution to the solar neutrino problem has been previously disfavored by bbn @xcite .",
    "we consider the sma msw active - sterile neutrino mixing solar solution and the vacuum active - sterile neutrino mixing solar solution . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the vacuum sterile neutrino solar solution was considered to be disfavored using the current combined solar neutrino experiment rate data .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was argued that if only the solar super - k spectrum or the seasonal solar data are considered , then the vacuum active - sterile neutrino mixing solution gives a better fit than a vacuum active - active neutrino mixing solution .",
    "since the nature of neutrino mixing of solar neutrinos is still not certain and since bbn considerations may prove to be enlightening , we entertain the possibility of a vacuum active - sterile neutrino mixing solution to the solar neutrino deficit .",
    "the vacuum sterile neutrino mixing solution to the solar neutrino problem was also considered in terms of a neutrino mass model represented by the [ su(3)]@xmath45 or @xmath46 groups in ref.@xcite .",
    "the interpretation of current experimental results usually is framed in terms of an effective two neutrino mixing scenario ( i.e. , in terms mass - squared - differences and mixing angles ) for each experimental situation .",
    "this model is approximately valid in the two - doublet four - neutrino mixing scheme because , as a result of the mass hierarchy , one two - species mixing dominates in each of the above experiments .",
    "it is , however , more informative to employ the full @xmath13 mixing matrix in our discussion .",
    "in the next section we will briefly review what has been learned about this mixing matrix from the current experiments .",
    "we will then proceed to consider bbn @xmath1he synthesis in the presence of hierarchical four - neutrino mixing schemes . from the @xmath1he yield we infer potential new constraints on the inter - doublet mixing matrix elements between active neutrinos and the sterile neutrinos . in section iii",
    ", we will summarize our results .",
    "we adopt the convention of employing greek indices to denote flavor eigenstates @xmath44 , @xmath25 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and employing latin indices to denote mass eigenstates @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the two bases are related by a unitary transformation @xmath51 : _ = _ i=0,3u_i_i .",

    "therefore , the bbn constraints on mixing models involving a vacuum solar solution are less stringent .",
    "in the two - doublet neutrino mixing schemes considered here , the @xmath112 channel is essentially decoupled ( at or near its resonance temperature ) from the other mixings within the four species family .",

    "there are two possible consequences of a resonant active - sterile neutrino mixing : ( 1 ) the total neutrino energy density at a given temperature increases if neutrino pair production is still effective in replenishing the converted active neutrinos ; ( 2 ) a lepton number asymmetry may be generated in the active neutrino sector from initial small and negligible statistical fluctuations during the resonant active - to - sterile neutrino conversion process . in either the nonresonant or resonant mixing case",
    ", the limit on the total neutrino energy density from the primordial @xmath1he abundance puts the following constraint on the parameters of active - sterile neutrino mixing @xcite : @xmath121    in the resonant case , the increase in the neutrino energy density is significant to bbn when the resonance is adiabatic and occurs before chemical decoupling of the active neutrino ( about 5 mev for @xmath104 ) .",

    "when averaged over the positive domains and the negative domains , the net @xmath3 turns out to be consistently larger than that predicted by the standard bbn picture assuming no neutrino mixing .",
    "this is because the increase in @xmath3 in negative domains is never compensated by the decrease in @xmath3 in positive domains , as shown in fig .",

    "this result is rather different from that in ref .",
    "@xcite and given the controversy in the calculations alluded to above , it is difficult to say which , if either , is correct .",
    "part of the discrepancy may be because the effect of energy density increases on @xmath3 were not appropriately taken into account in ref .",
    "a simple average of the change in @xmath3 in our calculation is not beyond observational uncertainty bounds .",
    "the average @xmath131 is always less than @xmath132 , or , equivilantly , @xmath8 is always less than 3.08 .",
    "if a definitive , confident solution to lepton number generation by neutrino mixing in the early universe were to show unambiguously that the sign of the neutrino asymmetry for this specific range of neutrino mixing parameters is positive ( negative ) then the predicted change to @xmath3 would follow the lower ( upper ) curve .",
    "the positive lepton number result alone does not exceed the observational bounds of fig .",
    "the observations more greatly constrain increases to @xmath3 . a negative lepton number result alone",
    "therefore creates a @xmath131 that is too large for @xmath133 .",
    "the averaged @xmath3 is only a lower limit to the actual @xmath3 in the two - doublet neutrino model with chaotic lepton number generation .",
    "this is because , as first pointed out by shi and fuller @xcite , additional increases in @xmath3 may arise from an extra channel for increasing the total neutrino energy density . in the case where the sign of the lepton number generated is undetermined , the extra channel for sterile neutrino production results from the lepton number gradients between domains of regions with opposite lepton number sign ( which are sub - horizon scale at the bbn epoch ) .",
    "the domain boundaries can meet the conditions for resonant conversion of not only @xmath104 to @xmath44 ( and @xmath134 to @xmath135 ) but also @xmath25 to @xmath44 ( and @xmath136 to @xmath135 ) .",
    "therefore , the sterile neutrino sea is not only populated within domains by the resonant neutrino mixing that drives the lepton number generation in the first place , but can also be populated at domain boundaries by the same resonant neutrino mixing as well as other active - sterile neutrino mixings .    to avoid fully thermalizing the sterile neutrinos , therefore , requires that this extra channel of sterile neutrino production be suppressed . in other words ,",
    "all resonances of active - sterile neutrino conversion have to be non - adiabatic at domain boundaries .",

    "the primordial @xmath1he yield in this scenario is sensitive to the relative level of mixing for @xmath148 and for @xmath149 .",
    "for example , we can define a factor @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the effective two - neutrino vacuum mixing angles ( to be constructed from the matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ approxu ] ) ) corresponding to @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "figure [ lsnd ] then shows limits from the observed @xmath1he abundance for three cases : ( 1 ) @xmath155 ; ( 2 ) @xmath156 ; and ( 3 ) @xmath157 . more specifically , if the atmospheric neutrino problem solution is maximal @xmath14 mixing ( and non-@xmath20 violating ) , then @xmath158 is just the ratio of inter - doublet mixing angles @xmath159 it is noteable that a novel solution to r - process nucleosynthesis in type ii supernovae by caldwell , fuller and qian @xcite involves a @xmath13 model where only @xmath77 is non - vanishing in the above expression for @xmath158 . in this case , effectively @xmath160 , indicating an exceptionally high degree of `` symmetry . ''",
    "( here by `` symmetry '' we mean that only one mixing angle governs the inter - doublet mixing , not four ; however , this is very asymmetric as far as @xmath158 is concerned ! ) both this solution to r - process nucleosynthesis and the domain - conversion - based bbn considerations discussed in this paper favor a large @xmath158 . the mixing matrix in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is related to that shown in eq .",
    "[ cfqu2 ] , exhibits the symmetry that allows a decoupling of a neutrino state ( @xmath88 ) from msw resonant evolution . for mass scheme iii to both account for the lsnd signal ( whose two - neutrino parameter space is shown in fig .",
    "[ lsnd ] @xcite ) and be consistent with domain - conversion - driven bbn effects , the difference in magnitude of the inter - doublet mixing angles must be large ( a large value of @xmath158 ) .",
    "if one were to entertain models where @xmath158 was not large ( _ i.e. _ , comparable values for @xmath161 and @xmath162 ) , then already we can see from fig .",
    "[ lsnd ] that the lsnd data compatible with smaller @xmath158 all lies near @xmath163 ev@xmath28 and @xmath164 .",
    "concommitantly , future experiments such as boone @xcite might indicate mixing parameters which fall outside this limit . assuming our bbn domain - conversion - driven considerations are correct",
    ", this would argue strongly for large @xmath158 .",
    "this would be a remarkable outcome .",
    "naively , one might assume that , _",
    "e.g. _ , the boone experiment measures only the effective two - neutrino mixing @xmath151 .",
    "however , when combined with other experiments and the bbn physics adopted here , it is evident that many other mixing matrix elements ( those in @xmath158 ) are also probed .",
    "we have explored the possible change in the primordial @xmath1he abundance in the currently favored two - doublet four - neutrino ( @xmath43-@xmath42/@xmath25-@xmath44 ) mixing scheme proposed to simultaneously explain the current neutrino experiments .",
    "though definitive calculations of matter - enhanced neutrino conversion effects are elusive at present ( in the eyes of some ) , here we have adopted the set of calculations which could give the tightest constraints on the neutrino mass and mixing matrix .",
    "we do this in the spirit of determining what may be possible .",
    "when we analyze the bbn effects in the context of full four - neutrino mixing we find some remarkable hints .",
    "namely , we find that putative limits on the matrix elements governing @xmath165 and @xmath166 could be very restrictive .",
    "we have found that these limits strongly depend on the mixing between @xmath25 and @xmath44 : the limits are exceptionally strong if the @xmath18 mixing parameters are in the range of the sma msw solution of the solar neutrino problem ; but they are much less so , allowing the @xmath167 mixing to be at the same level as the @xmath168 mixing , if the @xmath18 mixing parameters lie at the vacuum just sosolution region the solar neutrino problem .",
    "( note : since the submission of this paper there has been recent evidence from super - kamiokande that disfavors all sterile neutrino solutions to the solar neutrino problem @xcite .",
    "this emphasizes bbn constraints on any four - neutrino models . )",
    "in addition , we have found that if @xmath169 ev@xmath28 , the @xmath167 mixing should also be extremely small",
    ".    therefore , the mixing structures in these different cases of the hierarchical four - neutrino schemes can be very disparate .",
    "potentially , unless the inter - doublet active - active and active - sterile mixings are very asymmetric , bbn considerations demand a vacuum just so  solution to the solar neutrino problem and an lsnd solution with @xmath163 ev@xmath28 and @xmath170 in the two - doublet hierarchical mass scheme .",
    "alternatively , future @xmath32 experiments such as boone could be able to place significant constraints on functions of @xmath171 and @xmath162 .",
    "this is a tantalizing result . realizing it depends on the veracity of the particular bbn calculations we have adopted , but it is clear that the stakes are high .",
