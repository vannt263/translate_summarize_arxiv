    "<S> a class of anisotropic einstein metrics is presented . these metrics are axial symmetric and contains an anisotropy parameter @xmath0 , which is identified as the amplitude of the proper acceleration of the origin , thus explaining the ellipsoid shape of the horizon .    among exact solutions to einstein equation , </S>",
    "<S> the constant curvature solutions , i.e. einstein metrics , play a very special role , because such solutions correspond to gravitational fields with no matter distribution , which in physics terms dabbed `` vacuum solutions '' . in modern cosmological context , </S>",
    "<S> the positive constant curvature spacetime ( i.e. de sitter spacetime ) is of particular importance , as it is regarded to be the future asymptotics of our universe . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , the constant curvature ( pseudo-)riemannian metrics are also of great importance , because they represent the maximally symmetric spaces and are often used as of ideal models of more complicated curved spaces .    the prototype einstein metrics with positive , zero and negative constant curvatures are given respectively by the de sitter , minkowski and anti - de sitter line elements @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the spacetime dimension and @xmath3 is the line element for a unit @xmath4-sphere @xmath5 we denote @xmath6 as @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath8 is called the ( a)ds radius and is related to the cosmological constant @xmath9 via @xmath10 these line elements are explicitly isotropic about the origin and it can be shown without much effort that they are also homogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> actually , as pointed out in @xcite , a maximally symmetric space is necessarily homogeneous and isotropic about all points .    </S>",
    "<S> naturally one can raise questions such as `` are there any einstein metric which is anisotropic or non - homogeneous ? '' the answer is certainly yes . </S>",
    "<S> actually , non- homogeneous einstein metrics are not rare . </S>",
    "<S> any vacuum black hole solution ( e.g. schwarzschild and schwarzschild-(a)ds black holes ) will break the homogeneity whilst still preserves the isotropy about the origin . vacuum black hole solutions with rotation parameters ( e.g. kerr and meyers - perry black holes ) will also break the isotropy about the origin . </S>",
    "<S> so the answer to the above question seems to be well known . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the absence of black holes , examples of einstein metrics which are anisotropic or non - homogeneous are less well known , with the exceptions of warped embedded spaces , see , e.g. @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . the present note is aimed to present a novel class of anisotropic einstein metrics beyond the class of warped embeddings which can still be presented in a very neat and compact manner .    </S>",
    "<S> the novel metrics which we have in mind are given as follows : @xmath11,\\label{1 } \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> ds_{2}^{2 } & = \\omega(r,\\theta_{1})^{2}\\left[-dt^{2 } + dr^{2 } + r^{2 } d\\omega_{n-2}^{2}\\right],\\label{2}\\\\ ds_{3}^{2 } & = \\omega(r,\\theta_{1})^{2}\\left[-\\left(1+\\frac{r^{2}}{\\ell^{2}}\\right)dt^{2 } + \\left(1+\\frac{r^{2}}{\\ell^{2}}\\right)^{-1}dr^{2 } + r^{2 } d\\omega_{n-2}^{2}\\right],\\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the overall conformal factor @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 the explicit dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath14 breaks the isotropy of the original ds , minkowski and ads metrics . </S>",
    "<S> each of the 3 metrics depends on the parameter @xmath0 through @xmath12 , while ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) depend on an extra parameter @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> since at @xmath15 , @xmath16 , we see that the anisotropy of the above metrics are solely caused by the presence of the parameter @xmath0 , and we may hence refer to it as the anisotropy parameter . </S>",
    "<S> each of the 3 metrics satisfies the vacuum einstein equation @xmath17 with @xmath18 , and the free parameters are explicitly related to cosmological constant via @xmath19 we can easily see that the metric ( [ 2 ] ) can be seen as the @xmath20 limit of either ( [ 1 ] ) or ( [ 3 ] ) , whilst ( [ 3 ] ) can be obtained via @xmath21 from ( [ 1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we need only to consider the metric ( [ 1 ] ) in the following . </S>",
    "<S> we henceforth drop the suffix 1 from the line element ( [ 1 ] ) and the corresponding cosmological constant ( [ lambda ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we shall consider only the cases with @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological constant @xmath9 in ( [ lambda ] ) can take positive , zero and negative values depending on the values of @xmath0 and @xmath8 ( we assume both @xmath23 and @xmath8 are positive ) : @xmath24 we thus see that the geometry of the metric described by the line element ( [ 1 ] ) differs drastically from the de sitter metric ( [ ds ] ) , even though they are simply conformally related to each other . </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward consequence of this difference concerns the horizon structure . for the de sitter metric ( [ ds ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath25 represents a cosmological horizon . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the metric ( [ 1 ] ) , things differ . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath26 , conformal infinities will be reached before @xmath27 approaches the value @xmath8 , thus @xmath25 is beyond the coordinate patch of the spacetime described by the chosen coordinate system . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath28 , @xmath27 can approach the value @xmath8 , but this constant @xmath27 hypersurface contains the conformal infinity in some direction and so does not describe a complete horizon . if @xmath29 , @xmath27 can approach the value @xmath8 without touching conformal infinities in any direction , and hence @xmath25 represents a complete horizon . to fully describe the horizon structure we will have to find global coordinates corresponding to the spacetime ( [ 1 ] ) , which is a complicated task and </S>",
    "<S> is beyond the scope of this note . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasis that hitting the conformal infinity before reaching the @xmath25 hypersurface does not imply that horizon do not exist . </S>",
    "<S> it just means that the coordinate system which we use will breakdown at the region which is under exploration . for a detailed discussion on the global structure of a similar spacetime in 4d and 5d , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) and ( [ 3 ] ) , with only a slightly different definition of the overall conformal factor . </S>",
    "<S> the same similarity happens between the spacetime discussed in @xcite and the 5d version of ( [ 1 ] ) . ] .     </S>",
    "<S> with @xmath30,height=302 ]    in spite of the sharp differences of the spacetime ( [ 1 ] ) from de sitter spacetime ( [ ds ] ) , we can still find some common features of the two metrics . </S>",
    "<S> the most significant common feature is the following : every light - like vector for the spacetime ( [ ds ] ) will remain to be light - like in ( [ 1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the case when @xmath25 can be approached and describes a horizon , we would ask what the geometry of the horizon looks like in the spacetime ( [ 1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this horizon geometry is described by the line element @xmath31 clearly this is a conformal @xmath4-sphere but we would like to have a vivid view on the actual shape . for the most interesting case of @xmath32 we can make a plot of the surface , as shown in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> this is an ellipsoid with the @xmath33 direction playing the role of a rotational symmetric axis . </S>",
    "<S> this is not a surprise because the function @xmath12 for fixed @xmath27 obeying @xmath34 represents an ellipse and this plays the role of a variable radius for the horizon surface at any constant @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to ask what makes the horizon looks like an ellipsoid . </S>",
    "<S> bearing in mind that the horizon(s ) may exist even when the cosmological constant is zero or negative , it is not difficult to guess that such horizons can only be caused by acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> it is indeed so . to clarify this point </S>",
    "<S> , we take a static observer following a timelike geodesics in the spacetime ( [ 1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an observer is represented by the worldline @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the proper time and @xmath37 are independent of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the proper velocity is given by @xmath38 hence , the proper acceleration @xmath39 obeys @xmath40 at @xmath41 , the amplitude of the proper acceleration is @xmath42 , which gives a geometric explanation for the meaning of the parameter @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is of particular interest to understand the case @xmath32 more thoroughly , because this case may have some cosmological implications . </S>",
    "<S> the proper acceleration amplitude ( [ amp ] ) indicates that @xmath33 and @xmath43 are two extrema of the proper acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> this fact , combined with the ellipsoid shape of the horizon shown in fig.1 , indicates that there should be a dipole moment from the point of view of the accelerating observer . </S>",
    "<S> this dipole effect reminds us of the cmb dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> the standard explanation , the cmb dipole moment is due to the peculiar motion of our milky way with respect to the nearby galaxy cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we should now ask whether this peculiar motion contains some acceleration factor . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can infer from ( [ amp ] ) that even when @xmath44 , the proper acceleration does not vanish , and thus according to unruh effect , there will be an acceleration horizon appearing in the spacetime from the point of view of the accelerating observer . </S>",
    "<S> is the observed acceleration of the universe solely due to the proper acceleration of ourselves ? </S>"
