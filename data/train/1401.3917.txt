    "recently , the babar collaboration @xcite measured the mass difference between the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 and the natural line width of the @xmath1 vector meson ; they obtained very precise values : @xmath3 kev and @xmath4 kev . for @xmath5 mesons ,",
    "the strong pion emission is one of the dominant decay modes which determine their life times .",
    "thus , these precise values provide an ideal occasion to test different theoretical estimations for the strong interactions of the heavy mesons .",
    "it is widely accepted that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the correct theory for strong interactions .",
    "qcd is a renormalizable quantum field theory which is closely modeled after quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the most accurate physical theory we have to date . in qcd ,",
    "the colored quarks interact by exchanging @xmath6 yang - mill gauge fields ( gluons ) which are also colored , so that gluons interact directly among themselves .",
    "this feature leads to the strength of the quark - gluon interaction decreases with increasing momentum transfers ( asymptotic freedom ) @xcite .",
    "thus , in high - energy processes , quarks and gluons only weakly interact , and physical processes become describable by the perturbation theory .",
    "numerous experiments performed on powerful particle accelerators around the world have attested to the extraordinary success of this theory at high energy @xcite . on the other hand , in the low - energy ( or long - distance ) regime ,",
    "qcd tells us that the interactions between quarks and gluons are strong , so that quark - gluon dynamics becomes nonperturbative in nature .",
    "consequently , for low energy phenomena , it is hard to perform any reliable calculations from first principles .",
    "thus , understanding the structures of hadrons directly from qcd remains an outstanding problem . in 1989 , it was realized that , in low energy situations where the typical gluon momenta are small compared with the heavy quark mass @xmath7 , qcd dynamics becomes independent of the flavor ( mass ) and spin of the heavy quark @xcite .",
    "these new spin and flavor symmetries combine to form a @xmath8 symmetry , called heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) , which is not manifest in the original qcd lagrangian .",
    "of course , even in this infinite heavy quark mass limit , low energy qcd dynamics remains nonperturbative , and there are still no solutions to old problems like quark confinement , etc .",
    "hqs allows us to factorize the complicated light quark and gluon dynamics from that of the heavy one , and thus provides a clearer physical picture in the study of heavy quark physics . beyond the symmetry limit",
    ", a heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) can be developed by systematically expanding the qcd lagrangian in powers of @xmath0 , with which hqs breaking effects can be studied order by order @xcite .    in the other extreme , due to the relatively small light quark masses @xmath9 , the light quark sector of the qcd lagrangian obeys an approximate @xmath10 chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "it was known early on that this symmetry must be spontaneously broken by the qcd vacuum , so that the physical spectra of hadrons made up of light quarks would have only @xmath11 symmetry . moreover , due to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry , there exist eight pseudoscalar bosons ( called goldstone bosons , which include three @xmath12 s , four @xmath13 s , and one @xmath14 ) , whose dynamics obeys the @xmath10 chiral symmetry . from the above discussions , it should be clear that if we want to study the low energy interactions of heavy hadrons and goldstone bosons , we need to build an effective theory that obeys both chiral and heavy quark symmetries .",
    "this is done in references @xcite , where chiral symmetry and hqs are synthesized in a single effective chiral lagrangian which describes the strong interactions between heavy hadrons and goldstone bosons .",
    "the theory has since been extended to incorporate electromagnetic interactions as well @xcite .    for excited heavy mesons @xmath15 , pion and photon emissions",
    "are the dominant decay modes which determine their life times @xcite . in principle",
    ", the effective chiral lagrangian provides an ideal framework in which to study the strong decay mode .",
    "however , symmetry considerations alone in general do not lead to quantitative predictions , unless further assumptions are made to extract the values of the various coupling constants appearing in the lagrangian .",
    "furthermore , the framework of an effective chiral lagrangian does not allow for a systematic discussion of hqs violating @xmath0 effects , which however is important for a thorough understanding of heavy quark physics .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to systematically study the @xmath0 effects in a covariant model for strong and radiative decays of heavy meson .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly review hqet and the chiral dynamics of heavy meson . in sec .",
    "iii , we construct a covariant model which is based on hqet .",
    "some heavy meson properties in the heavy quark limit and @xmath0 corrections are considered .",
    "the numerical calculations and discussions are expressed in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v , we make some concluding remarks .",
    "the full qcd lagrangian for a heavy quark ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or @xmath18 ) is given by l_q = |q  ( i_d^- m_q )  q , [ lag ] where @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",

    "therefore , the heavy quark qcd lagrangian , eq .",

    "[ l00 ] from eq .",
    "( [ l00 ] ) , it is evident that this effective lagrangian possesses _ flavor _ and _ spin _ symmetries , also known as heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) , because it is independent of the heavy quark mass @xmath23 and the @xmath30 matrix , respectively .",
    "thus , hqs predicts that for the @xmath31 system , the pseudoscalar @xmath32 and the vector @xmath33 states are degenerate .",
    "experimentally , the pseudoscalar - vector ( or hyperfine ) mass splitting @xmath34 is given by @xcite : m_b^ * - m_b 45.78  , + m_d^ * - m_d 142.12  , [ hqsmass ] from which we see that the experimental mass difference gets smaller as the mass of the heavy quark gets heavier .",
