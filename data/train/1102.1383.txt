    "polyhedral membrane models endowed with bond and dihedral angle potentials ( hereafter referred to as _ membrane networks _ ) are widely employed in many different physical and engineering problems , including molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations of bio- and nano - structures ( refer , e.g. , to the recent review papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , and non - conforming models of plates and shells ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) , among others . referring to the special case of the red blood cell membrane ,",
    "the bond potentials reproduce the protein filaments forming the membrane skeleton , while the dihedral angle potentials mimic the bending rigidity endowed by the lipid bilayer ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in such a case , the discrete nature of the network is motivated by the finite size of the protein filaments , and the convenience of numerical approaches like md and monte carlo simulations ( @xcite , @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", the use of membrane networks for the development of _ lumped strain _ models of plates and shells allows for capturing local effects due , e.g. , to strain localization , plastic hinges and folding - like buckling ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a key question for such models is the determination of the continuum limit of stretching and bending energies , when the nearest neighbor distance @xmath0 becomes infinitesimally small ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) . while the limit form of the membrane energy is well established in the literature , at least for harmonic bonds ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) some questions still remain open regarding the continuum limit of the bending energy , when cosine - type dihedral angle potentials are employed . as a matter of fact ,",
    "earlier results in terms of helfrich - type limiting energies for triangulated networks suffer from deficiencies due to shape - dependence and mesh distortion effects ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "different is the case of bending energies based on nodal averages of dihedral angles , which exhibit a more uniform limit behavior ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we deal in the present paper with the derivation of limiting stretching and bending energies of static membrane networks undergoing large in - plane and out - of - plane deformations .",
    "we consider a discrete mass spring system with nearest neighbor and dihedral spring interaction subject to deformation , and provide explicit formulae for the energy in the system when the number of particles ( vertices ) tends to infinity ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) .",
    "the limiting energy only depends on the geometric data of the deformation mapping . as",
    "compared to previous works on the limiting bending energies of membrane networks ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) , the present study follows a different from discrete to continuum approach , by interpreting the discrete deformation of the network as the restriction of a continuous deformation mapping @xmath2 to a triangular lattice .",
    "this is in agreement with the cauchy - born rule of crystalline matter ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and avoids mesh - dependent effects ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) . in the bending - dominant deformation regime ,",
    "when the deformed configuration of the network approximatively coincides with an equilateral triangulation of a curved surface , the formula we obtain for the limiting bending energy reduces to @xmath3 where : @xmath4 is the dihedral constant ; @xmath5 is the reference configuration : @xmath6 is twice the mean curvature , and @xmath7 is the gaussian curvature .",
    "the formula above corresponds to a helfrich - type energy @xmath8 , with @xmath9 and @xmath10 for any geometry , @xmath11 and @xmath12 being the bending and gaussian rigidities , respectively ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this formula in particular applies to lipid membranes which show a fluid - like behavior in the in plane coordinates .",
    "such a behavior leads to the relaxation of all stretching energy contributions and thus results in a pure bending energy functional .",
    "those membranes can be described accurately within our framework of spring networks if we allow for a distribution of defects in the underlying lattice network on a mesoscopic scale . in this way one can find",
    "meshes with almost no stretching contributions in any deformed configuration .",
    "also note that the energy then only depends on the curvature tensor of the surface @xmath13 and @xmath2 is merely some parameterization of that surface used to express the bending energy @xmath14 in local coordinates .    for general deformations of triangulated networks with both stretching and bending contributions , however",
    ", the limiting energy expressions will naturally depend on the lattice reference configuration . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the prediction of mesoscopic values of the referential moduli from md simulations , eventually different from region to region of the model , allows one to adequately inform simulations at the continuum scale , such as , e.g. , lagrangian finite element models .",
    "moreover , stability analyses are naturally performed through referential ( or thermodynamic ) elastic constants , as shown , e.g. , in @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite .    concerning the present estimates of the bending and gaussian rigidities , we wish to remark that @xcite ( @xcite ) found the different result @xmath15 and obtained a limiting bending energy of the form @xmath16 .",
    "the same authors also estimated @xmath17 by applying this formula to a cylindrical network .",
    "subsequently , @xcite ( @xcite ) made use of the result @xmath15 to derive a different value of @xmath11 for the sphere .",
    "these authors computed the limiting value of a discrete notion of the laplacian part of the helfrich energy ( @xmath18 ) , and subtracted the total curvature of the sphere @xmath19 to @xmath20 . on matching @xmath21 to the limiting value of the total dihedral energy of the sphere ( @xmath22 , cf .",
    "formula ( 19 ) of @xcite , @xcite ) , they finally obtained @xmath23 for such a geometry .",
    "it is easily seen that the present limiting bending energy @xmath24 exactly reduces to the limiting dihedral energies of both the sphere and the cylinder , with @xmath17 in each case ( cf .",
    "[ cases ] ) .",
    "we wish to remark that the scale bridging approach behind the ` universal ' results @xmath9 and @xmath10 assumes that the discretized surface matches the limiting shape in correspondence with the vertices of the triangulation . in more detail ,",
    "such results are obtained looking at the discrete dihedral energy under the above cauchy - born type assumption , without making any ` a priori ' guess on the @xmath25 ratio .",
    "interestingly , the present estimates of @xmath11 and @xmath12 correspond to those obtained in @xcite , @xcite for the bending - dominant regime , through direct arguments .",
    "these authors ` assume ' that the limiting bending energy can be written as a helffrich - type energy with two free parameters ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 , namely ) in such a regime .",
    "then they use the two explicit cases of a sphere and a cylinder to determine the above parameters .",
    "an analogous result is deduced in @xcite , @xcite for the special case of a spherical shell .",
    "as we already observed , the present result for the bending energy is obtained without any a - priori assumptions on the structure of the limiting energy and the shape of the network and , as far as we know , represents the first complete proof to - date that the limiting continuum energy of membrane networks endowed with cosine - type dihedral angle potentials is actually a helffrich type functional in the bending - dominant regime .",
    "the general formula we provide for the bending energy accounts for the coupling of large stretching and bending deformations , which is a key feature of finite deformation shell theories ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it allows us to handle arbitrarily distorted triangulations , thus resolving the distortion sensitivity effects that derive from the use of a pure bending energy in the continuum limit ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "concerning the limiting stretching energy , our findings confirm the results given in @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first introduce the examined network model and the basic assumptions of the adopted scale bridging approach in sec .  [ model ] .",
    "next , we develop universal formulae for the limiting stretching and bending energies of such a network in secs .  [ stretching ] and [ bending ] , respectively .",
