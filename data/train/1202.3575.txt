    "the bose - einstein correlation ( bec ) of identical boson pairs , mainly @xmath2 mesons , produced in particles and heavy ion collisions has been studied since the early 1960 s @xcite . in the one - dimensional bec analyzes one frequently utilizes the lorentz invariant variable @xmath3 which is defined as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the four momentum of the @xmath6 identical boson . taking the emitting source of the bosons to be described by a spherical symmetric gaussian density distribution , the correlation function of two identical bosons",
    "can then be given e.g. by @xmath7 where ( also referred to at times as @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) is the one dimensional ( 1d ) value of the particles emitter source and @xmath0 is the strength of the bec effect .",
    "this @xmath0 , which is the chaoticity parameter , lies within the range of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath11 are frequently introduced to account for possible long range correlations , like those related to momentum and energy conservations , while @xmath12 is a normalization factor .",
    "the results obtained from bec analyzes depend among others on the assumption that the low percentage of the non pion outgoing charged tracks does not influence the bec results . furthermore the particular choice taken from the various reference samples against which the bec effect is compared to has to be kept in mind when common underlying features are searched for in the bec analyzes results .",
    "in addition the reported values for charged identical bosons were not always a subject to a coulomb correction which however is small and estimated to be @xmath13 fm ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in more recent studies the bec analyzes",
    "were extended to two and three dimensions to allow for non - spherical emitting sources @xcite .",
    "our present study concentrates on the 1d case which allows us to include early bec analyzes of @xmath14 collisions carried out at relatively low energies .",
    "the main aim of the present work is to study the dependence on the @xmath15 colliding center of mass energy @xmath16 , the outgoing charged hadron multiplicity and hadronic jets and to explore the possibility to use it for the estimation of the average number of hadronic jets emitted over the full final state phase space .",
    "the recent operation of the large hadron @xmath15 collider ( lhc ) at cern has opened up the opportunity to examine the derived from bec of identical pion pairs produced in @xmath15 collisions at very high center of mass energies up to 7 tev .",
    "a set of values , obtained via eq .",
    "( [ eq_main ] ) and taken from refs @xcite are presented in fig .",
    "[ rpp ] as    a function of the @xmath15 colliding energy in the range of @xmath16 from 5 gev to 15 tev .",
    "the errors shown are the statistical and systematic ones added in quadrature . from the two alice values at 0.9 tev",
    "reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , the one with the considerably smaller systematic error was chosen . in the figure",
    "the cms and alice values at 0.9 tev are for clarity shifted slightly apart . here",
    "it should be noted that the data selection criteria used for the measurements at the lhc energies are somewhat different from those used in the bec analyzes at the lower energies . in particular at the lhc energies the observed hadron tracks used for the correlation",
    "analyzes are confined to a restricted phase space domain commonly specified in terms of the experimentally accessible pseudorapidity @xmath17 range where @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18.\\ ] ] here @xmath19 is the absolute value of the outgoing particle three momentum vector and @xmath20 is its longitudinal momentum component .",
    "however it has already been previously observed @xcite that the bec lengths show , if at all , only a weak dependence on @xmath17",
    ".    a clear rise of with @xmath16 is seen in fig .",
    "[ rpp ] and is here represented by the continuous line which was obtained from a fit of the expression @xmath21 to the data yielding @xmath22 fm and @xmath23 fm with a @xmath24 of 0.3/5 where @xmath16 is given in tev units .",
    "the deviation of @xmath25 1 s.d . is indicated by the dashed lines in the same figure . at first one is lead to presume that the increase is a direct consequence of the energy rise however",
    ", this apparently can not be the prime reason as has been recently clearly demonstrated by the cms collaboration @xcite . in their bec study",
    "they have compared the values measured in @xmath15 collisions at the two energies of 0.9 and 7.0 tev as a function of the outgoing charge multiplicity which are shown in fig .",
    "[ cms_energy ] .",
    "the dotted and solid curves in the figure are the results from the fits of the relation @xcite @xmath26 to the data yielding the values @xmath27 fm and @xmath28 fm at 0.9 and at 7.0 tev respectively .",
    "as can be seen , the two fitted curves almost coincide so that one can safely conclude that is essentially independent of the energy but is correlated to the increase in the charge multiplicity as has already been observed in the studies of @xmath15 and light ion collisions @xcite as well as in the @xmath29 annihilations @xcite .",
    "the average final state charge multiplicity @xmath30 produced in @xmath15 and @xmath31 collisions is known to increase with energy as shown in the left part of fig .",
    "[ mult1 ] which was taken from ref .",
    "the @xmath30 values shown were obtained from the charged tracks emitted in @xmath15 and @xmath31 collisions summed up over the entire phase space which was experimentally quite accessible in reactions at a relatively low @xmath16 regions .",
    "however , it became more difficult as the energy increased with the hadron colliders to the values near 2 tev at the @xmath31 tevatron accelerator and even higher to the current value of 7  tev supplied by the lhc at cern where the analysis was restricted to a limited phase space defined by a range in the pseudorapidity @xmath17 . in this limited phase space",
    "one has still the possibility to determine @xmath32 i.e. , the differential charge multiplicity density as a function of @xmath17 . to represent a @xmath32 distribution one often uses its specific value at @xmath33 that is @xmath34 . the right part of fig .",
    "[ mult1 ] , taken from reference @xcite , shows the charge multiplicity density at @xmath17=0 obtained in @xmath15 and @xmath31 collisions as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "a clear rise of both @xmath30 and @xmath34 with @xmath16 is seen which can be parametrized by a power series in @xmath35 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ mult1 ] .",
    "further properties concerning the charge multiplicity behavior as a function of energy can be found e.g. in reference @xcite .",
    "taking the @xmath30 dependence on energy in gev units @xcite to be @xmath36 and for the one given by eq .",
    "( [ r1d ] ) one obtains @xmath37 combining the relation @xmath38 given in @xcite , where @xmath39 is in gev@xmath40 units , and the energy dependence given by eq .",
    "( [ r1d ] ) one has @xmath41 which is valid from about @xmath42 . the dependence on @xmath30 and on @xmath34",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ rvsn ] .    from this figure",
    "one may of course also estimate from the measured the values of @xmath30 and @xmath34 at the same @xmath15 energy .",
    "even though is seen to rise with @xmath30 , the bec studies of the @xmath43 hadronic decays at the lep @xmath44 collider have shown that the fundamental reason for the rise is the increase of the number of the hadronic jets , @xmath45 .",
    "an example of this feature is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ opal_mult ] where and @xmath0 results obtained from bec analyzes of the @xmath43 hadronic decay carried out by the opal collaboration at lep @xcite are plotted . in the left part of the figure is seen to increase with while @xmath0 decreases with it . in the right part of this figure one",
    "observes that the values are consistently higher for 3-jet events than those derived from the 2-jet events while both sets of the values are only slightly dependent on .",
    "at the same time the @xmath0 values do not reveal any obvious separation between the 3 and 2-jet events nor do they show a distinct dependence on the charge multiplicity .",
    "a similar result has also been obtained by the l3 collaboration at lep @xcite . that the value is indeed linked to the number of hadronic jets",
    "has already been successfully demonstrated in the study of the measured dependence of on @xmath16 in @xmath44 annihilations into hadrons @xcite .",
    "a compilation of values obtained from bec analyzes of identical pions produced in heavy ion collisions @xcite has shown that to a good approximation the relation @xmath46 fm holds where @xmath47 is the atomic number of the colliding nucleus .",
    "this dependence on @xmath47 is consistent with the dependence of the radius of nuclei on @xmath47 deduced from other types of experiments such as the electron nucleus scattering .",
    "the increase in is attributed first to the rise in the number of the hadron sources , that is the number of participating nucleon - nucleon collisions , as @xmath47 increases . the second feature which causes the to rise",
    "is the absence of a bec effect ( i.e. @xmath0=0 ) in identical boson pair correlation emerging from different sources .",
    "this last feature has been experimentally verified e.g. in the process @xmath48 where the bec effect is present in identical pion pairs emerging from the same @xmath49 gauge boson but is absent when the pair was emitted from two different @xmath49 gauge bosons @xcite . from this",
    "follows that whenever identical bosons are collected for a bec analysis from more than one source the over all correlation decreases which results , as briefly elucidated below , in an increase in .",
    "inasmuch that the emitting sources are similar the values obtained from bec of two identical bosons emitted from @xmath50 and @xmath51 sources are related by @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the reduction factors corresponding respectively to the @xmath50 and @xmath51 sources . it has further been shown that in the case that the sources have about the same charge multiplicity then for @xmath55 the reduction factor is simply given by @xmath56 this inverse dependence of @xmath57 on the number of sources holds also when the occurrence of slight deficiencies in the multiplicity measurement are accounted for while the usage of the full dilution value implies that the system of sources fully overlap in the momentum space @xcite .",
    "thus the bec deduced values from the @xmath50 and @xmath51 sources are related by    @xmath58    as has been applied successfully in the past @xcite we also here , in particle reactions , associate the hadronic jets with the boson sources . as a consequence eq .",
    "( [ maineq ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath59 thus from and @xmath0 measurements via bec analyzes at two different @xmath15 energies one should be able to estimate the ratio of the average number of hadronic jets @xmath60 produced over the full phase space at these two energies .",
    "here it is worthwhile to note the the bec method for jet analysis does not depend on a a particular choice of a jet finding algorithm and its variables .",
