    "additionally , the data obtained between july 1989 and may 1991 were not used in any of the fits because the difference between the parkes clock and utc is not known to better than 50@xmath11s .",

    "we now outline the main characteristics of this distribution and draw some conclusions from it .",
    "the most striking characteristic of the pulsar distribution is that all the pulsars in 47  tuc with measured positions lie within @xmath0 ( 3 core radii ) of the centre of the cluster , despite the fact that the tidal radius of 47  tuc is about @xmath12 ( table  [ tab:47tuc ] ) .",
    "this distribution , as we shall now see , is not an artifact introduced by the size and shape of the parkes telescope radio beam pattern , which has a half - power radius of @xmath13 at 1400mhz .",
    "the flux densities for most of the pulsars have been calculated by camilo et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . among the pulsars with a known solution , 47  tuc",
    "n has the lowest flux density ( 0.03 @xmath14 0.01 mjy ) .",
    "supposing that this value is the lower limit for the flux density of a pulsar for which we can obtain a timing solution , weak pulsars like 47  tuc  u , with a flux density of 0.06 @xmath14 0.01 mjy , are detectable in a circle with a radius of at least @xmath15 .",
    "there are 10 pulsars with at least this flux density , and the fact that none of these is seen outside a radius of @xmath0 is therefore a true feature of the pulsar distribution , and not an artifact due to the shape of the beam .",
    "it should also be noted that the original surveys at 660mhz @xcite , with a larger telescope beam , covered an area approximately 100 times the size of the roughly arcmin - scale central region in which we now localize the 15 pulsars .",
    "( 0,3.2 ) ( 0,0 )    ( 0,3.2 ) ( 0,0 )    the present pulsar distribution is essentially an equilibrium distribution .",
    "the characteristic ages of these pulsars are of the order of @xmath16 yr , while the relaxation time ( the time it takes for a pulsar to change kinetic energy significantly through interactions with other stars ) in the core of 47  tuc is of the order of @xmath17 yr @xcite .",
    "therefore , the pulsars are expected to be in thermal equilibrium with the remaining stars , and their distribution should be merely a function of their mass and of the potential of the cluster . indeed , the de - projected pulsar distribution is consistent with @xmath18 until about 4 core radii , decreasing sharply outside this radius ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] ) .",
    "this concentration of pulsars near the centre of the cluster is a consequence of mass segregation : if all objects in a cluster have reached thermal equilibrium , i.e. , all stellar populations have a similar average kinetic energy , then the most massive populations , among which are the pulsars , will have smaller velocities , and therefore will dwell deeper in the potential well of the cluster .",
    "to quantify this , we note that the kinetic energy of the lighter stars in the cluster core , with mass @xmath19 , is limited by the escape velocity @xmath20 . equating the resulting limit of kinetic energy to that of the pulsars results in a limit to the velocity of pulsars bound in the cluster core : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the pulsar mass . as pulsars move away from the centre of the cluster under the influence of the cluster s gravitational potential their velocities decrease , eventually reaching zero at a maximum possible distance @xmath23 from the centre of the cluster .",
    "the potential energy @xmath24 at @xmath23 is calculated from conservation of energy : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cluster potential .",
    "using equation  [ eq : kinetic ] we obtain @xmath27 this limit , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( the average mass for isolated and binary pulsars ) , is represented by a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] , where we use a king model for the gravitational potential of 47  tuc ( king 1966 ; phinney , priv . comm . ) . from this",
    "we derive @xmath30 , which is very close to the inferred 4 @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the confinement of the pulsars in the inner region can be explained , to first order , as resulting from the shape of the potential and the upper limit for the kinetic energy of the pulsars .",
    "the fact that all pulsars are located close to the core is a constraint on any future more accurate model of the gravitational potential of the cluster .",
    "spitzer  ( 1987 ) demonstrates that the distributions of two stellar species of mass @xmath32 and @xmath33 in thermal equilibrium with all stars in a cluster are related by @xmath34 therefore , two stellar populations with similar masses in thermal equilibrium should have similar radial distributions .",
    "some of the most massive blue stragglers known in 47  tuc have masses of 1.31.6m@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "because this is the mass range expected for pulsars @xcite , including binaries such as those in 47  tuc @xcite , both populations should have similar radial distributions , which is apparently the case @xcite .",
    "however we caution that the population considered by rasio ( 2000 ) is not altogether homogeneous , having a relatively wide range of masses",
    ". ultimately it will be useful to compare the radial distribution of just the most massive blue stragglers with that of pulsars , and in particular to determine whether they display the abrupt radial cutoff observed for pulsars .",
    "lastly , spitzer shows that outside 3 core radii , the mass distribution for the dominant stellar species should be of the type @xmath36 . knowing this and the fact that the radial distribution of the pulsars in m15 is @xmath37 @xcite , phinney  ( 1992 ) used equation  [ eq : r_distribution ] to infer that the dominant stellar species near the centre of m15 is 0.9  m@xmath35 white dwarfs . in principle",
    "we could use the same argument to show , based on the observed pulsar distribution in 47  tuc , that the dominant stellar species in the central region of this cluster is made of 1.31.6m@xmath35 objects .",
    "however , the fact that the pulsars lie within ( and not outside ) 3 core radii may complicate this interpretation ( although the `` pulsar core '' should be more compact than that of the cluster ) .",
    "( 0,3.5 ) ( 0,0 )      there is a remarkable coincidence between the celestial coordinates of 47  tuc  g , an isolated pulsar , and 47  tuc  i , a binary pulsar ( see table  [ tab : offsets ] ) .",
    "the projected angular distance between these two pulsars is only 120mas .    to estimate the chance probability of finding two pulsars in such close proximity ,",
    "suppose that pulsars are randomly distributed in a disk of radius @xmath38 ( the projected angular distance of these two pulsars from the centre of the cluster ) .",
    "for a given pulsar , the probability of finding a second one at a projected distance of @xmath2 or less is proportional to the area of a disk of radius @xmath2 divided by the area of a disk of radius @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",
    "the probability of being at a distance larger than @xmath2 is 0.99995 .",
    "for the five pulsars known within @xmath38 , we have 10 different possible pairs .",
    "the probability of not finding any pulsar within @xmath2 of any other pulsar is @xmath40 , i.e. , the overall probability of finding one or more pulsars projected within @xmath2 of any other is @xmath41 , about one in 2000 .",
    "if the pulsars are near to each other but not interacting significantly , then the acceleration caused by the cluster should be similar for both of them . in ",
    "[ sec : accel ] we see that their values of @xmath42 are similar , with a difference of @xmath43s@xmath4 , in a possible range @xmath44 20 times larger .",
    "therefore , the combined probability of finding the pulsars with such close projected separation and with such similar accelerations is about one in 40,000",
    ".    given this low formal probability of chance coincidence , it is worth considering that these two pulsars may be in a hierarchical triple system with a major axis of at least 600a.u .",
    "a system with two components 600a.u .",
    "apart is not likely to remain bound for long in the dense environment of a globular cluster . by considering the stellar flux with one - dimensional speeds of @xmath45 , an estimate for the mean time a binary system can survive in a dense environment ( i.e. , before it gets hit by another cluster member )",

    "we estimate @xmath52@xmath53yr .",
    "this time is comparable to the orbital period of the putative binary system , and @xmath54@xmath55 the age of the cluster .",
    "thus , despite the low formal probability of a chance coincidence , this simple calculation argues against the reality of such an association .",
    "ultimately , the reality or otherwise of this system can be tested by future measurements of higher period - derivatives for the two pulsars .",
    "the proper motions listed in table  [ tab : proper_motions ] are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pm ] , together with the value measured for the proper motion of the cluster by odenkirchen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . at the 2-@xmath48 level",
    "all these proper motions are consistent with each other .",
    "if a pulsar is moving with a transverse velocity @xmath56 ( kms@xmath4 ) relative to the centre of the cluster , the difference in proper motions is @xmath57masyr@xmath4 , where @xmath58 is the distance to the cluster in kpc .",
    "the escape velocity of 47  tuc is about 58kms@xmath4 ( table  [ tab:47tuc ] ) .",
    "therefore , in order to detect a pulsar in an escape trajectory at the 3-@xmath48 level , we would have to measure relative proper motions of about 2.4masyr@xmath4 with a precision better than 0.8masyr@xmath4 , and we are approaching this level for 47  tuc  j ( table  [ tab : proper_motions ] ) .",
    "if the pulsars are in thermal equilibrium with the surrounding stars , their relative motions are of the order of the central velocity dispersion or less , i.e. , @xmath59kms@xmath4 .",
    "thus , detecting their relative motions implies measuring relative proper motions of about 0.5masyr@xmath4 with a precision of 0.15masyr@xmath4 .",
    "the typical precision for the positions of the weakest pulsars is around 5mas . in order to obtain a precision of 0.15masyr@xmath4 for these we would have to measure the positions of the pulsars again in @xmath60 years time .",
    "however , for the brightest pulsars , with positional accuracies of about 1mas , it will suffice to make another measurement in about 10 years , using current data - acquisition systems .",
    "the assumption of thermal equilibrium for the pulsars implies that , with current timing precision , a measurement of the proper motions of these pulsars is in effect a measurement of the proper motion of the cluster .",
    "we can therefore make a weighted average of the five proper motions and determine the motion of the cluster , knowing that the peculiar motions of the pulsars should be smaller than the errors in the individual measurements .",
    "the weights chosen are simply the inverse of the uncertainties in each coordinate . for the currently - observed proper motions , we find the weighted average value to be @xmath61masyr@xmath4 and @xmath5masyr@xmath4 .",
    "the uncertainties are taken to be the sum in quadrature of the weighted dispersion of the values of proper motion for the pulsars about the average , and 0.5masyr@xmath4 , which accounts for the expected actual dispersion of proper motions .",
    "nine of the 15 pulsars in table  [ tab : common_parameters ] have negative period derivatives ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this has been observed before for some pulsars located in globular clusters ( e.g. , wolszczan et al .",
    "1989 ) . rather than being due to",
    "intrinsic spin - up , negative period derivatives are thought to be caused by the acceleration of the pulsar towards the earth in the cluster potential ( see fig .",

    "we derive limits for the ages and magnetic fields of the pulsars in   [ sec:47tucpsrlimits ] .",
    "the observed period derivative , @xmath63 , is the sum of the pulsar s intrinsic spin - down , @xmath64 , and the effect of the acceleration along the line of sight , @xmath65 .",

    "these values are consistent with those measured for galactic millisecond pulsars ( e.g. , camilo , thorsett & kulkarni 1994 ) .    note that these limits are extremely conservative , and are independent of any detailed modeling of the cluster .",
    "it is nevertheless clear that even with such a crudely over - estimated @xmath174 we can derive useful limits for the parameters of the pulsars .    by modeling the cluster and obtaining better constraints for @xmath185",
    ", more stringent limits can be derived .",
    "for this reason , we now compare the observed pulsar @xmath42 with the maximum accelerations along each line of sight calculated from the king model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : accel ] ) .",
    "the limits for the pulsar parameters derived from this model are also presented in table  [ tab:47tucpsrlimits ] .",
    "as expected , these are more constraining than those derived before .",
    "in particular , the characteristic ages for 47  tuc  c and m exceed 3gyr , and a simple average of the lower limits on age for all pulsars yields @xmath253gyr , while the magnetic field strengths of 47  tuc  j and m are less than @xmath254gauss , very close to the lowest values observed among galactic disk pulsars .",
    "these values depend , of course , on the particular cluster model used in calculating the accelerations .",
    "limits for the characteristic ages and magnetic fields of the pulsars in m15 have been derived by anderson ( 1992 ) , using a mass model for the cluster based on the surface luminosity density and assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio .",
    "the majority of pulsars in that cluster have characteristic ages @xmath255yr @xcite , but there are signs of a relatively recent burst in pulsar formation .",
    "at least two pulsars have maximum characteristic ages @xmath256yr and magnetic fields of about ( 1020)@xmath257gauss . this is attributed to the ongoing core collapse in m15 , leading to much increased recycling of pulsars . in 47  tuc ,",
    "on the other hand , there are no visible signs of such a recent burst in pulsar formation : all the known pulsars for which a timing solution has been obtained have characteristic ages ( probably much ) greater than 170myr , weak magnetic fields , and very short rotational periods .",
    "the binary systems containing pulsars in 47  tuc are divided into two main groups , segregated by companion mass @xcite .",
    "the first is composed of binaries with very short orbital periods ( 1.55.5hr ) and companion masses @xmath258 .",
    "we have timing solutions for three of these ( 47  tuc  i , j and o ) .",
    "the second group has orbital periods in the range 0.42.3d and companion masses @xmath259 ; we refer to this group as `` normal '' binaries . of these , 47  tuc",
    "e , h , q , t and u have a timing solution at the moment .",
    "coherent timing solutions give extremely detailed orbital information , and often allow the measurement of very small eccentricities . most millisecond pulsar ",
    "white dwarf systems in the galactic disk have very low , but measurably significant eccentricities ( e.g. , camilo 1999 ) .",
    "these are thought to result from tidal interactions between the neutron star and convective cells in the envelope of its companion during the giant phase of its evolution , and a relationship between orbital period and eccentricity can be derived for such systems @xcite .",
    "the millisecond pulsar ",
    "white dwarf systems in globular clusters often have larger eccentricities than those in the disk of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "these are thought to result from interactions with other stars in the cluster : the denser the environment , the more likely one is to find a relatively large degree of eccentricity in the system .",
    "the five eccentricities measured for binary pulsars in 47  tuc ( for the normal binaries 47  tuc  e , h , q , t and u ; see table  [ tab : binaries ] ) are all much larger than one would expect for similar systems in the galactic disk , and are therefore , presumably , a fossil remnant of gravitational interactions between the binary systems and other cluster stars .",
    "rasio & heggie ( 1995 ) calculate the expected value of this eccentricity for a system with a particular binary period that has interacted with other stars in a region of known density for a certain length of time .",
    "unfortunately we do not know the relevant densities or interaction time scales for the pulsars observed in 47  tuc with any degree of certainty , possibly not even to an order of magnitude .",
    "nevertheless , taking plausible estimates for density and time scales , we derived some `` predicted '' eccentricities .",
    "those for 47  tuc  e , q , and t are within an order of magnitude of the observed values , which is as close to agreement as we can expect to attain given the uncertainties in input parameters .",
    "the computed eccentricity for 47  tuc  u is two orders of magnitude below the observed value , while that for 47  tuc  h is under - predicted by a factor of 1000 .    one possible explanation for the unexpectedly large eccentricity of 47  tuc  u , and possibly that of 47  tuc  h",
    ", is that they have in the past spent a considerable amount of time in a region with a much higher stellar density than they are found in at present .",
    "for instance , if 47  tuc  l ( an isolated pulsar ) had spent @xmath260yr in its present location while part of a 2.35-day binary , its computed eccentricity would be 0.15 .",
    "therefore , some of the pulsars we observe relatively far from the centre of the cluster may have non - circular orbits in the cluster potential which take them through higher - density regions periodically , or may have been ejected from higher - density regions to their present locations , leading to some of the large eccentricities measured .",
    "alternatively , the high eccentricity of the 47  tuc  h binary system , by far the largest in the cluster , could indicate that it obtained its present companion as an already - formed white dwarf through an exchange interaction .",
    "however , such exchanges tend to produce even higher eccentricities @xcite .",
    "the large eccentricity of 47  tuc  h has permitted a measurement of its rate of advance of periastron : @xmath261 ( table  [ tab : binaries ] ) . assuming that this advance is entirely due to general relativity , and not to any tidal effects ( which is likely , since both stars are presumably degenerate and have negligible dimensions compared to the orbital separation ) , the total mass of the binary system is @xmath262 ( all uncertainties here are given at the 2-@xmath48 level ) . a mass - mass diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1m2h ] , from which limits on the individual masses can be derived : @xmath263 and @xmath264 .",
    "it is also improbable that @xmath265 or @xmath266 , because this would require @xmath267 .",
    "( 0,3.5 ) ( 0,0 )",
    "in this paper we have presented phase - coherent timing solutions for 15 millisecond pulsars in 47  tuc .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarised as follows .",
    "all pulsars with known timing solutions are located less than @xmath0 from the cluster centre , and inside this region , their spatial density is of the type @xmath1 .",
    "this distribution is different from that found in m15 ( @xmath268 \\propto r^{-3.1}$ ] , with no well - defined outer limit ) , and possibly similar to the distribution of blue stragglers in 47  tuc with similar masses .",
    "their confinement near the centre of the cluster is real , and not a selection effect .",
    "it is a very important constraint on any model of the potential of 47  tuc .",
    "two of the pulsars ( 47  tuc  g and i ) have a projected separation of only 600a.u . , and similar @xmath42 .",
    "although it is unlikely , they may belong to the first system known with two detectable pulsars , but further timing measurements are required to investigate this .",
    "we have measured the proper motions of five of the pulsars in 47  tuc .",
    "only the general motion of the cluster is detectable , and the value calculated from averaging the proper motions of the pulsars is consistent with the proper motion of the cluster measured with _",
    "hipparcos_.    lower limits for the surface mass density at several radial cuts near the centre of the cluster were derived .",
    "we have also used the values of @xmath151 to obtain limits on , or estimates of , the accelerations at several projected distances from the centre of the cluster .",
    "these are consistent with a king model of the cluster using accepted values for its distance to 47  tuc , angular core radius and central velocity dispersion .",
    "we inferred upper limits for the magnetic fields of 15 pulsars : all are below @xmath269gauss . also , no pulsar has a characteristic age smaller than 170myr .",
    "additionally we determined that the characteristic ages of the pulsars are , on average , greater than 1gyr .",
    "the fact that none of the known binary pulsars has an orbital period larger than 2.35 days is an important result .",
    "simulations of their formation @xcite suggest that we should find binary pulsars with orbital periods as large as about one month .",
    "however , despite the fact that there are no selection effects against the detection of such systems , we find none .",
    "this suggests that any binary pulsars with longer periods were either hardened by interactions with other stars , disrupted by the high stellar density near the centre of the cluster , or were simply outnumbered by tight binaries formed at a later stage .",
    "the timescale of such processes is proportional to the relaxation time , i.e , it is proportional to the time between close encounters between any two stars .",
    "binary formation and hardening is a source of kinetic energy for the remaining stars in the cluster and tends to delay ( or in some cases reverse ) core collapse @xcite ; the lack of long - period binaries therefore suggests that the core of 47  tuc has had a density similar to or larger than the present one for a time that is much longer than the relaxation time , i.e. , a few billion years @xcite .",
    "if the cluster had reached the present central density in the last few hundred million years , and if it had never experienced a high - density phase before , then it should still contain binary pulsars with long orbital periods .",
    "as we have also seen , the ages of the pulsars are of the order of a few gyr , and their large numbers in this cluster suggest that vigorous millisecond pulsar formation occurred a long time ago , which is consistent with the idea that the core of 47  tuc was once , or has been for a long time , in a high - density state .    another piece of evidence of possible relevance to this question comes from the higher than expected eccentricities of binaries like 47  tuc  u and h , the latter of which enabled us to measure its rate of advance of periastron , yielding a total mass @xmath270m@xmath35 .",
    "these eccentricities suggest that the product of stellar density and velocity dispersion near these binaries was higher than is observed today for a long time , possibly several gyr (   [ sec : binaries ] ) . whether this was so because the pulsars spent a considerable amount of time nearer the present - density core , or because the core was once denser , it would imply a dense core for a very long period of time .",
    "if the core of 47  tuc was in fact relatively dense for a few gyr , it is likely that this contributed to the large numbers of millisecond pulsars in the cluster ( via the mechanisms of binary formation and hardening in dense cores ) . in that case",
    "the number of millisecond pulsars in a cluster depends heavily on its previous dynamical history .",
    "this could explain why clusters with similar properties ( core density , total mass , stellar mass distribution , metallicity ) have large differences in their pulsar populations , in both number and kind @xcite .",
    "more complete searches for pulsars in globular clusters , a better understanding of selection effects and a good determination of the evolutionary states of globular clusters will be needed to address this question .",
    "a continuing timing programme will lead to additional and improved measurements of the proper motions of the pulsars .",
    "a measurement of the proper motions of the pulsars relative to the cluster would add constraints to the cluster mass model .",
    "continued timing will also allow a better determination of the orbital parameters of 47  tuc  h , and will test whether 47  tuc  g and i are physically associated .",
    "additional solutions for known pulsars may also be determined , and new pulsars will almost certainly be discovered . continued monitoring of this cluster is therefore likely to remain a worthy enterprise .",
