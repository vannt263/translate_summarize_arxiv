    "the resulting thermodynamic riemannian curvature scalar @xmath0 has been explored by a number of authors for black hole thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of the present paper is an attempt at a physical interpretation of @xmath0 , and its systematic evaluation for the kerr - newman black hole .",
    "the analogy with ordinary thermodynamics is emphasized , as is the significance of the sign of @xmath0 .",
    "the thermodynamic fluctuation formalism requires stability , namely , fluctuations about a maximum in the total entropy .",

    "was obtained by restricting the number of independent fluctuating variables .",
    "in addition , an infinite extensive environment was employed to have the fluctuations depend only on the known thermodynamics of the black hole .    for an ordinary thermodynamic system ,",
    "@xmath5 was interpreted @xcite as proportional to the correlation volume @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the system s spatial dimensionality and @xmath11 is its correlation length .",
    "direct calculations in a number of statistical mechanical models have verified this @xcite ; see @xcite for a more recent review . a thermodynamic quantity , @xmath0 , then reveals information normally thought to reside in the microscopic regime , @xmath11 .",
    "thus , @xmath0 has been of interest in black hole physics , which has good thermodynamic structures , but little conclusive microscopic information .",
    "i interpret @xmath5 for black holes as the average number of correlated planck areas on the event horizon .",
    "although i give no direct microscopic model evidence , this interpretation would seem to be well motivated by the analogy with ordinary thermodynamics .",
    "zero @xmath0 indicates then `` pixels '' or `` bits '' on the event horizon fluctuating independently of each other .",

    "two dimensions are consistent with the membrane paradigm of black holes @xcite .",
    "i also find instances of diverging @xmath0 where the heat capacities @xmath2 and @xmath3 diverge and change sign , signalling a change of stability .",
    "although divergences in these heat capacities were identified by tranah and landsberg @xcite in 1980 , they have been little discussed in the literature .",

    "fourth , i compare the results with those in ordinary thermodynamics .",
    "a major element in my approach is that the black hole resides in an infinite environment , characterized by mass @xmath14 , angular momentum @xmath15 , and charge @xmath16 .",
    "the thermodynamics of the environment should be extensive ; namely , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 should each scale up in proportion to the environment s volume . with this structure ,",
    "thermodynamic fluctuations require only the known thermodynamics of the black hole . the environment s thermodynamic properties , which might be difficult to determine ( dark matter , etc . ) , only sets the state about which fluctuations occur .",
    "this structure is thermodynamically unstable if we allow an exchange of all three variables @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "stability requires either a finite environment or a restriction on the number of independent fluctuating variables .",
    "in @xcite i took the later approach , and considered the stability of seven cases in an infinite environment : fluctuating @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . ) under a variety of conditions , including ones similar to those here .",
    "these authors used the sophisticated poincar@xmath21 turning point method which allows stability statements for finite environments with thermodynamics not necessarily known . with an infinite environment , however , the black hole entropy hessian determinants are sufficient for considerations of stability @xcite . fluctuating conserved variables @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 are commonly referred to as `` canonical , '' and fixed conserved variables as `` microcanonical .

    "( [ 522 ] ) is negligible compared with the first . to see this ,",
    "fix the values of @xmath47 , which equal @xmath48 .",

    "@xmath53    the gaussian approximation to the fluctuation probability is    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the determinant of @xmath52 and @xmath56 is the number of independent fluctuating variables .",

    "all components of the riemannian curvature tensor may be expressed in terms of the curvature scalar @xmath0 @xcite . not so in higher dimensions .",

    "i can not presently support this idea with microscopic calculations of a type which were so valuable in ordinary thermodynamics .",
