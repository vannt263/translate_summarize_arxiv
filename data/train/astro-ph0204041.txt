    "in a recent astro - ph submission , @xcite claim that the lamentable pathetic lackey ( hereafter lpl ) graduate students are dominant over steward observatory graduate students . these findings are found to be completely false , indeed laughable , in light of the evidence .",
    "lpl graduate students are found to be utterly irrelevant - more so than magnetic fields in most astrophysical settings .",
    "the theoretical groundwork for lpl graduate student irrelevance ( lgsi ) was originally laid down as fermat s lamest theorem ( fermat 1637 ; see also carrot - top 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "the theorem was later included by einstein into a general theory of `` irrelativity '' ( 1918 ) , in which all beers taste the same independent of reference frame . while much theoretical work has been done on the subject ,",
    "only recently has empirical evidence been found to convincingly demonstrate lgsi .",
    "@xcite claim lpl athletic superiority over steward graduate students .",
    "they conveniently forgot to mention that * two * events were to be scheduled : volleyball and ultimate frisbee .",
    "lpl graduate students have consistently displayed shameless fear when asked to compete in ultimate frisbee .",
    "loss of bladder control was witnessed on at least one occasion ( d. obrien , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , lpl graduate students have a commanding lead over steward in terms of drug - related felonies .",
    "a yakov - smirnov b - s test confirms this result at the 99.9997% level . while this evidence does not clearly demonstrate that steward is cooler than lpl ,",
    "it does demonstrate that lpl grads are fairly slow , and easily caught .    _",
    "f__ig.1  felony drug charges versus time .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that lpl grad students are slow , and easily caught .",
    "the academic core courses tackled by lpl graduate students have been found to be farcical .",
    "lpl core curriculum    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     \\(a ) due to popular demand a new dodge - ball - intensive + planetary sciences minor will be offered starting in 2004 .",
    "a pie - chart of lpl graduate student time usage is illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "we define the number of useful papers from lpl grad students @xmath1 using the famous `` drake equation '' : @xmath1 equals the number of students @xmath2 divided by the volume of bad beer consumed @xmath3 times the hours each student is awake @xmath4 ( negligible to first order ) .",
    "we originally calculated this to be unity , but later concluded that @xcite did not merit recognition as a useful paper .",
    "readers need not be reminded of steward graduate student contributions such as the epic `` super huge interferometric telescope : a new paradigm in optical interferometry '' @xcite , and the `` the effects of moore s law and slacking on large computations '' @xcite .",
    "only 2 students joined the lpl graduate program in fall 2001 , compared to 10 at steward observatory . only through begging and pleading on behalf of lpl bigwigs was the lunar & planetary lab building spared reallocation of office space to new steward graduate students .",
    "@xcite contained misspelled words such as `` dotoral '' and `` illigitimate '' .",
    "this demonstrates the inability to run a standard spell - checker .",
    "we later found that their paper _ was _ spell - checked , but with a speak - and - spell .",
    "a standard speak - and - spell contains 80 vocabulary words and 14 barnyard animal sounds , so they were unable to check the spelling of their longer words .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that the root of the word `` dotoral '' is actually `` dolt '' , however .",
    "the utter irrelevance of lpl graduate students has been empirically demonstrated ."
