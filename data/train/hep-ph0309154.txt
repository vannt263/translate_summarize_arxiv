    "the cp even higgs boson ( @xmath7 ) is essential in the existence of the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions .",
    "therefore , its possible detection in future collider experiments is one of the main goals of physicists to test the sm and to get strong information about the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking , the higgs mass and the top higgs yukawa coupling .",
    "the light higgs boson , @xmath8 , mainly decays into @xmath9 pair @xcite .",
    "however its detection is difficult due to the qcd background and the @xmath10 channel , where the higgs boson decays to @xmath9 , is one of the promising one @xcite . for a heavier higgs boson @xmath11 ,",
    "the suitable production exists via gluon fusion and the leading decay mode is @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in@xcite , it is stated that this decay mode gives three order times larger events compared to the mode @xmath13 .",
    "besides the quark or lepton flavor conserving decays of @xmath7 , the flavor violating ( fv ) @xmath7 decays have been studied in series of works in the literature .",
    "@xmath14 decay is an example for lepton fv ( lfv ) decays and it has been studied in @xcite . in @xcite , a large branching ratio ( @xmath15 ) , at the order of magnitude of @xmath16 , has been estimated in the framework of the 2hdm . in @xcite , its @xmath15 was obtained in the interval @xmath17 for the higgs mass range @xmath18 , for the lfv parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the observable cp violating asymmetries in the leptonic flavor changing @xmath7 decays with @xmath15s of the order of @xmath20 has been examined in @xcite .",
    "the lfv @xmath21 decay has been studied also in @xcite .",
    "the present work is devoted to the lorentz and cpt violating effects on the @xmath15 and the ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the @xmath15s coming from the lorentz violating effects ( the sm ) for the decays @xmath22 ( @xmath4 quarks and charged leptons ) and @xmath23 .    the lorentz and cpt symmetry violations exist in the extended theories like the string theory @xcite , the non - commutative theories @xcite , which are more fundamental and exist at higher scales . in such scales ,",
    "there are signals that the lorentz and cpt symmetries are broken @xcite .",
    "however , the small violations of these symmetries can appear at the low energy level and in the sm of particle physics , which is the low energy limit of more fundamental theories , such tiny effects are switched on . in @xcite , the general lorentz and cpt violating extension of the sm",
    "is obtained .",
    "the source of these new effects are the coefficients which can arise from the expectation values in the string theories or some coefficients in the noncommutative field theories @xcite , existing at the planck scale @xcite .",
    "in addition to string theory and noncommutative geometry , space - time - varying scalar couplings can also lead to lorentz - violating effects described by the sm extensions @xcite .",
    "the general lorentz and cpt violating effects have been studied in quantum electro dynamics ( qed ) extensions @xcite , in maxwell - chern - simons model @xcite , in the noncommutative space time @xcite , in wess - zumino model @xcite and the theoretical overview of lorentz and cpt violation has been done in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "some of these coefficients has been restricted using the experiments and in @xcite it was pointed that threshold analyzes of ultra- high - energy cosmic rays could also be used for lorentz and cpt - violation searches .",
    "there are also some phenomenological works done on the the lorentz and cpt violating effects in the sm extension . in @xcite ,",
    "the lorentz and cpt violating effects on the @xmath15 and the cp violating asymmetry @xmath24 for the lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions @xmath25 and @xmath26 has been analyzed in the model iii version of the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) and the relative behaviors of the new coefficients on these physical parameters have been studied . in @xcite",
    "these effects on the @xmath15 and on the possible cpt violating asymmetry @xmath27 for the @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) decay have been examined .    in this work ,",
    "we predict the ratios @xmath0 for @xmath30 decays and we get the small numbers of the order of @xmath31 at most , since the natural suppression scale for lorentz - cpt violating coefficients can be taken as the ratio of the light one , of the order of the electroweak scale , to the one of the order of the planck mass @xcite . for the @xmath3 decay this ratio is highly suppressed since the lorentz violating effects enters into expressions as the corresponding coefficient square .",
    "we also study the relative magnitudes the @xmath15s of the decays @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the case that only the lorentz violating effects are taken into account .",
    "we observe that the lorentz violating effects are tiny and it is not possible to detect in the present experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the theoretical expression for the decay width @xmath34 , for the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 quarks and charged leptons ) and @xmath5 decays , with the inclusion of the lorentz and cpt violating effects .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions .",
    "in this section we present the lorentz and cpt violating effects on the @xmath15 of the higgs decays , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 quarks and charged leptons ) and @xmath5 in the sm extension . for these decays ,",
    "the lorentz and cpt violating effects enter into calculations at tree level similar to the main contribution coming from the sm .",
    "the tiny lorentz - cpt violating effects are regulated by the new coefficients which have small numerical values and their natural suppression scale reaches to , at most , the ratio of the mass in the electroweak scale to the one in the planck scale .",
    "the lagrangian which is responsible for the @xmath36 decay is the yukawa lagrangian and , in the sm , it reads @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote chiral projections @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the higgs scalar doublet . here",
    "@xmath42 , are the yukawa matrices and u ( d , e ) denotes up quarks ( down quarks , charged leptons ) .",
    "the additional part due to the lorentz violating effects can be represented by the cpt - even lagrangian @xcite @xmath43 where the coefficients @xmath44 are dimensionless and antisymmetric .    using the well known expression defined in the @xmath7 boson rest frame @xmath45 where @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is the four momentum vector of @xmath7 boson ( fermion , anti - fermion ) , and @xmath48 is the matrix element of the process @xmath49",

    "notice that the lorentz violating effects enter into expressions quadratic in coefficient @xmath53 and therefore it is highly suppressed in the calculation of the decay width @xmath34 .",
    "now we will present the decay widths of the decays @xmath54 and @xmath33 including the possible lorentz - cpt violating effects in the sm extension .    the sm lagrangian which drives the @xmath55 decay is the so called kinetic term , @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the covariant derivative , @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the pauli spin matrix",

    "( [ gamsmlorvio ] ) shows that @xmath74 and @xmath75 depends on the cpt even @xmath76 coefficient .",
    "even if the sm is invariant under lorentz and cpt transformations , the small violations of lorentz and cpt symmetry , possibly coming from an underlying theory at the planck scale , can arise in the extensions of the sm . in this section",
