    "@xcite first proposed that the rate at which a gas forms stars might follow a simple power law correlation of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the star formation rate per unit volume , @xmath5 is the gas density , and @xmath6 is generally taken to be in the range @xmath7 . in the decades since , observations have revealed two strong correlations that appear to be evidence for this hypothesis . first , galaxy surveys reveal that the infrared luminosity of a galaxy , which traces the star formation rate , varies with its luminosity in the co(@xmath0 ) line , which traces the total mass of molecular gas , as @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified the closely - related correlation between gas surface density @xmath9 and star formation rate surface density @xmath10 , @xmath11 , a relation that has come to be known as the kennicutt law .",
    "since over the bulk of the dynamic range of kennicutt s data galaxies are predominantly molecular , this is effectively a correlation between molecular gas , as traced by co(@xmath0 ) line emission , and star formation .",
    "spatially resolved observations of galaxies confirm that , at least for molecule - rich galaxies where resolved co(@xmath0 ) observations are possible , star formation is more closely coupled with gas traced by co(@xmath0 ) than with atomic gas @xcite    second , @xcite find that there is a strong correlation between the ir luminosity of galaxies and emission in the hcn(@xmath0 ) line , which measures the mass at densities significantly greater than that probed by co(@xmath0 ) .",
    "however , they find that their correlation , which covers nearly three decades in total galactic star formation rate , is linear : @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite show that this correlation extends down to individual star - forming clumps of gas in the milky way , provided that their infrared luminosities are @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "interestingly , however , @xcite find a deviation from linearity in the ir - hcn correlation for a sample of intensely star - forming high redshift galaxies .",
    "these sources show small but significant excesses of infrared emission for their observed hcn emission .",
    "the difference in power law indices between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 correlations is statistically significant , and , on its face , puzzling .",
    "an index near @xmath17 seems natural if one supposes that a roughly constant fraction of the gas present in molecular clouds will be converted into stars each free - fall time . in this case one",
    "expects @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "if gas scale heights do not vary strongly from galaxy to galaxy , this implies @xmath19 as well , which is consistent with the observed kennicutt law . more generally , since the dynamical timescale in a marginally toomre - stable ( @xmath20",
    "; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) galactic disk is of order @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the angular frequency of the disk , an index close to @xmath17 is expected if star formation is regulated by any phenomenon that converts a fixed fraction of the gas into stars on this time scale @xcite .    on the other hand , @xcite suggest a simple interpretation of the linear ir - hcn correlation .",
    "they argue that the individual hcn - emitting molecular clumps that they identify in the milky way represent a fundamental unit of star formation .",
    "the linear correlation between star formation rate and hcn luminosity across galaxies arises because a measurement of the hcn luminosity for a galaxy simply counts the number of such structures present within it , each of which forms stars at some roughly fixed rate regardless of its galactic environment .",
    "however , in this interpretation it is unclear why the structures traced by hcn@xmath23 ) emission should form stars at the same rate in any galaxy . after all , one could equally well argue that molecular clouds traced by co(@xmath0 ) are fundamental units of star formation , but the non - linear ir - co correlation clearly shows that these objects do not form stars at a fixed rate per unit mass .",
    "moreover , the evidence presented by @xcite that the linear ir - hcn correlation varies in extremely luminous high redshift galaxies suggests that the relationship between hcn emission and star - formation may be somewhat more complex .",
    "in this paper we attempt to explain the origin of the difference in slope between the co and hcn correlations with star formation rate , and more generally to give a theoretical framework for understanding how correlations between star formation rate and line luminosity , which we generically refer to as kennicutt - schmidt ( ks ) laws , depend on the tracer used to define them .",
    "our central argument is conceptually quite simple , and in some sense represents a combination of the intuitive arguments for co and hcn given above .",
    "consider an observation of a galaxy in a molecular tracer with critical density @xmath24 , which essentially measures the mass of gas at densities of @xmath24 or more , i.e.  the gas that is dense enough for that particular transition to be excited . in galaxies where the median density of the molecular gas is significantly larger than @xmath24 ,",
    "this means that the observation will detect the majority of the gas , and the bulk of the emission will come from gas whose density is near the median density . since the gas density will vary from galaxy to galaxy , the star formation rate per unit gas mass will vary as roughly @xmath25 , with one factor of @xmath5 coming from the amount of gas available for star formation , and an additional factor of @xmath26 coming from the dependence of the free - fall or dynamical time on the density .    on the other hand , in galaxies where the median gas density is small compared to the critical density for the chosen transition , observations will pick out only high density peaks . since the density in these peaks is set by @xmath24 , and not by the conditions in the galaxy , these peaks are at essentially the same density in any galaxy where they are observed , and the corresponding free - fall times in these regions are constant as well . as a result ,",
    "the star formation rate per unit mass of gas traced by that line is approximately the same in every galaxy , because the corresponding free - fall time is the same in every galaxy .    in the rest of this paper",
    ", we give a quantitative version of this intuitive argument , and then discuss its consequences . in   [ formalism ]",
    "we develop a simple formalism to compute the star formation rate and the molecular line luminosity of galaxies , and in   [ predictions ] we use this formalism to predict the correlation between star formation rate and luminosity .",

    "first let us ask how quickly stars form in such a medium .",
    "@xcite give a model for star formation regulated by supersonic turbulence in which a population of molecular clouds of total mass @xmath47 form stars at a rate @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the free - fall time evaluated at the mean density and @xmath50 is a number of order @xmath51 that depends weakly on @xmath41 .",

    "this provides an alternative estimate of the star formation rate which is purely empirical , and independent of any particular theoretical model .",

    "for example , at @xmath61 the two estimates agree to within a factor of @xmath62 for densities in the range @xmath63 .",
    "given the scatter inherent in observational estimates of the star formation rate , a factor of 3 difference is not particularly significant , so it matters little which prescription we adopt . in practice",

    "now we must compute the luminosity of molecular line emission from the galaxy . even for a cloud that is not in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , for optically thin emission",
    "this calculation is straightforward .",
    "however , the molecular lines used most often in galaxy surveys are generally optically thick . to handle the effect of finite optical depth on molecule level populations and line luminosities",
    ", we adopt an escape probability approximation and treat clouds as homogeneous spheres .",
    "this is not fully consistent with our assumption that clouds have lognormal density pdfs , since the escape probability formalism assumes a uniform level population throughout the cloud , and the essence of our argument in this paper turns on how the level population varies with density .",
    "however , this approach gives us an approximate way of incorporating the optical thickness of star - forming clouds into our model , the only alternative to which for turbulent media is full numerical simulation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ", we must add an additional consistency condition relating the values of @xmath72 to the level populations .",
    "for a homogeneous spherical cloud , the escape probability for a given line is related to the optical depth from the center to the edge of the cloud @xmath77 by ( b.  draine , 2007 , private communication ) @xmath78 where @xmath77 is computed at the central frequency of the line . in turn",
    ", the optical depth is related to the level populations by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the wavelength of transition @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the statistical weights of states @xmath67 and @xmath70 , @xmath84 is the isothermal sound speed of the gas , and @xmath85 is the abundance of molecules of species @xmath66 .",
    "note that this equation implicitly assumes that the cloud has a uniform maxwellian velocity distribution with 1d dispersion @xmath86 , consistent with our treatment of the clouds as homogeneous spheres .",
    "one additional complication is that we do not directly know cloud radii for most external galaxies , where observations can not resolve individual molecular clouds .",
    "however , we often can diagnose the optical depths of transitions by comparing line ratios of molecular isotopomers of different abundances .",
    "we therefore take @xmath87 , the optical depth of the transition between the first excited state and the ground state , as known . for a given level population",
    "this fixes the value of @xmath64 .",
    "we solve equations ( [ levpop])([taucondition2 ] ) using newton - raphson iteration . in this procedure , we guess an initial set of escape probabilities @xmath72 , and solve the linear system ( [ levpop ] ) and ( [ levpop1 ] ) to find the corresponding initial level populations @xmath65 .",

    "in contrast , for hcn most of the luminosity comes from densities near the critical density regardless of the mass distribution . for the lowest @xmath30",
    "this means that the line luminosity is entirely dominated by the high density tail of the mass distribution .",
    "as the median density @xmath128 varies by a factor of 100 ( from @xmath129 @xmath32 ) , the peak of @xmath130 $ ] moves by just a factor of a few in @xmath36 .",

    "to the extent that most or all of the light from young stars is re - processed by dust before escaping the galaxy , the bolometric luminosity integrated over the wavelength range @xmath138 @xmath139 m , which we define as @xmath140 , simply provides a calorimetric measurement of the total energy output by young stars , and is therefore an excellent tracer of recent star formation @xcite .",
    "we therefore estimate the fir luminosity from the star formation rate via @xmath141 where @xmath142 is an imf - dependent constant . for consistency with @xcite ,",
    "we take @xmath143 . to be precise and to facilitate comparison with observations , we adopt the @xcite definition of @xmath140 as a weighted sum of the luminosity in the 60 and 100 @xmath139 m iras bands .",

    "the most important point to take from these plots is that the choice of galaxy model has little effect in most cases .",
    "the largest differences are for hcn , where at @xmath153 @xmath32 the ir to line ratio predicted for the intermediate case differs from the normal galaxy case by a factor of @xmath154 , and from the starburst case by a factor of @xmath155 .",
    "this variation comes primarily from changes in the mach number and the optical depth between models .",
    "the higher mach number of the starburst model significantly increases the amount of mass in the high overdensity tail of the probability distribution , while the higher optical depth lowers the effective critical density .",
    "both of these effect increase the amount of mass dense enough to emit in hcn(@xmath0 ) and reduce @xmath147 . at higher mean",
    "densities these effects become less important and the models converge , so that by @xmath132 @xmath32 the range in @xmath147 from the normal to the starburst case is only a factor of 3.5 .",
    "most importantly , our central conclusion that @xmath156 is roughly constant across galaxies , while @xmath157 rises as roughly @xmath158^{0.5}$ ] , still holds when we consider how conditions vary across galaxies .",
    "galaxies with low mean densities @xmath30 are generally closest to the normal galaxy case , while those with high mean densities should be closest to the starburst case , and this systematic variation in galaxy properties with @xmath30 still leaves @xmath147 relatively flat for hcn , and varying with a slope close to 0.5 for co. from the normal galaxy case at @xmath153 @xmath32 to the starburst case at @xmath132 @xmath32 , the value of @xmath147 varies by more than a factor of 50 for the co(@xmath0 ) , but by less than a factor of 3 for the hcn(@xmath0 ) .",
    "the calculations illustrated in figure [ sfrl ] demonstrate the basic argument that one expects a roughly constant star formation rate per unit line luminosity for high density tracers ( e.g. , hcn ) , and a star formation rate per unit luminosity that rises like luminosity to the @xmath159 for low density tracers ( e.g. , co ) .",
    "however , in large surveys one can not always determine the mean density in a galaxy , which would be required to construct an observational analog to figure [ sfrl ] .",
    "instead , we can use our calculated dependence of star formation rate and line luminosity on density to compare to observations as follows .",
    "equation ( [ linelum ] ) gives the total molecular line luminosity per unit volume and equation ( [ sfr ] ) gives the star formation rate , which we convert to an ir luminosity via equation ( [ sfrtolir ] ) .",

    ".    note that in both the middle and right panels of figures [ fig : l ] and [ fig : lm ] , one expects a turn upward in the correlation at high @xmath140 , a deviation from linearity .",
    "this follows from the fact that in our model , at fixed @xmath160 , systems with higher @xmath140 have higher average densities . at sufficiently high @xmath140",
    "we thus expect @xmath174 and @xmath176 to steepen , in analogy with the @xmath173 correlation .",
    "the data points with very high @xmath140 in figures [ fig : l ] and [ fig : lm ] , which might be used to test this prediction of our model , are gravitationally lensed , at high redshift , and contaminated by bright agn . it is therefore unclear if the deviation from linearity implied particularly by the upper limits in @xmath177 in the right panels of figures [ fig : l ] and [ fig : lm ] is a result of enhanced @xmath140 , caused by the agn emission @xcite , or is instead a result of less molecular line emission per unit star formation , as our model implies ( fig .",
    "[ sfrl ] ) .",
    "@xcite note , however , that in the three systems for which the contribution from the agn has been estimated ( f10214 + 4724 , d.  downes & p.",
    "solomon 2007 , in preparation ; cloverleaf , @xcite ; apm 08279 + 5255 , @xcite ) the corrections are only significant for apm 08279 + 5255 .",
    "this suggests that the data are so far consistent with our interpretation , but clearly much more data at high @xmath140  or , more precisely for our purposes , at high density  is required to test our predictions .",
    "we discuss the issue of agn contamination further in   [ limitations ] .    as a final note ,",
    "the data so far _ do _ support the utility of hco@xmath1 as a useful tracer of dense gas .",
    "@xcite has argued against the utility of hco@xmath1 as a faithful tracer of mass in starbursts on the basis that , since it is an ion , its abundance is strongly dependent on the free - electron abundance and might therefore vary strongly between galaxies with different ionizing radiation backgrounds .",
    "we can not rule out this possibility given the limited data set available , but we see no strong evidence in favor of it from the data shown in figures [ fig : l ] and [ fig : lm ] .",
    "as we have argued , hco@xmath1(@xmath0 ) is particularly useful because its critical density is between that of co(@xmath0 ) and hcn(@xmath0 ) and , thus , as figure [ fig :",
    "l ] and [ fig : lm ] show , the correlation between @xmath140 and @xmath178 should steepen from linear to super - linear over the range of galaxies presented in the co panels . a careful , large - scale hco+(@xmath0 ) survey similar to the work of @xcite on hcn(@xmath0 ) should reveal these trends .",
    "lines with similarly low excitation temperatures and intermediate critical densities like cs(@xmath0 ) should behave analogously .",
    "our results suggest that ks laws in different tracers naturally fall into two regimes , although there is a broad range of molecular tracers that are intermediate between the two extremes .",
    "tracers for which the critical density is small compared to the median density in a galaxy represent one limit . in these tracers ,",
    "the light faithfully follows the mass , so the ks law measures a relationship between total mass and star formation . in any model",
    "in which star formation occurs at a roughly constant rate per dynamical time , this must produce a ks law in which the star formation rate rises with density to a power of near @xmath179 , and the ratio of star formation to luminosity rises as density to the @xmath180 power . in terms of surface rather than",
    "volume densities , this implies @xmath181 . if we further add the observation that the scale heights @xmath182 of the star - forming molecular layers of galaxies are roughly constant across galaxy types , one form of the observed @xcite star formation law follows immediately @xcite .",
    "moreover , in a galactic disk , @xmath183 and @xmath184 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; since in star - forming disks the toomre-@xmath185 is about unity @xcite , substituting for @xmath182 immediately gives @xmath186 , the alternate form of the @xcite law .",
    "the other limit is tracers for which the critical density is large compared to the median galactic density .",
    "these tracers pick out a particular density independent of the mean or median density in the galaxy , and thus all the regions they identify have the same dynamical time regardless of galactic environment . in this case",
    "the star formation rate will simply be proportional to the total mass of the observed regions , yielding a constant ratio of star formation rate to mass , as is observed for hcn in the local universe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : l ] , right panel ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we predict that there should be a transition between linear and super - linear scaling of @xmath140 with line luminosity at the point where galaxies transition from median densities that are smaller than the line critical density to median densities larger than the critical density .",
    "the hco@xmath1(@xmath0 ) line , and other lines with similar critical densities , e.g. cs(@xmath0 ) and so(@xmath0 ) , should show this behavior for galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the observed correlation between @xmath187 and @xmath140 appears to be consistent with our prediction , although at present the data are not of sufficient quality to distinguish between a break and a single powerlaw relation .",
    "there are hints that the very highest luminosity star - forming galaxies , which all reside at high redshift and may well reach ism densities not found in any local systems , show such a break in the ir - hcn correlation .",
    "one important point to emphasize in this analysis is that we have been able to explain the observed correlations between line and infrared luminosities , and hence between gas masses at various densities and star formation rates , without resorting to the hypothesis that the star formation process is fundamentally different in galaxies of different properties .",
    "although uncertainties in both our model and the observations do not preclude an order - unity change in the star formation efficiency or @xmath50 as a function of @xmath140 , there is currently no evidence for such a change in the data , contrary to claims made by , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in fact , all of the observational trends are predicted by our simple model with _ constant _ star formation efficiency .",
    "this is consistent with other lines of evidence that the fraction of mass at a given density that turns into stars is roughly 1% per free - fall time independent of density @xcite .",
    "based on the linear correlation between hcn(@xmath0 ) luminosity and star formation rate , seen both in external galaxies and in individual molecular clumps in the milky way , @xcite and @xcite propose that hcn(@xmath0 ) emission traces a fundamental unit of star formation .",
    "they explain the linear ir - hcn correlation as a product of this ; in their model , hcn luminosity correlates linearly with star formation rate because hcn luminosity simply counts the number of such units .    based on our analysis",
    ", we argue that this hypothesis is only partially correct .",
    "we concur with gao & solomon and wu et al .  that the hcn(@xmath0 ) luminosity of a galaxy does simply reflect the mass of gas that is dense enough to excite the hcn(@xmath0 ) line .",
    "however , our analysis shows that this does not necessarily imply that this density represents a special density in the star formation process , or that objects traced by hcn(@xmath0 ) represent a physically distinct class .",
    "we show that a linear correlation between star formation rate and line luminosity is expected for any line with a critical density comparable to or larger than the median molecular cloud density in the galaxies used to define the correlation .",
    "it is possible that hcn(@xmath0)-emitting regions represent a physically distinct scale of star formation as @xcite propose , but one can explain the linear ir - hcn correlation equally well if they are just part of the same continuous medium as the regions traced by co(@xmath0 ) and by other transitions . even the star - forming clouds themselves may simply be parts of a continuous distribution of ism structures occupying the entire galaxy , as argued by @xcite . in this case",
    "there need be no special density scales other than the mean and median densities for the star - forming clouds on their largest scales , and the density at which star formation becomes rapid , converting the mass into stars in of order a free - fall time .",
    "this transition scale is unknown , but must be considerably larger than the density traced by hcn @xcite .        as mentioned in ",
    "[ schmidtlaws ] , our approach of leaving the gas temperature @xmath46 and mach number @xmath41 as free parameters is not entirely consistent with our calculation of the ir luminosity , since the ir luminosity and temperature are of course related . in principle , with a model of how the energy output from stars heats the dust and gas , together with a structural model connecting the energy and momentum output from stars to the generation of turbulence , it should be possible to self - consistently compute both the gas temperature and the mach number from the volumetric star formation rate ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such a model would return @xmath46 and @xmath41 as a function of @xmath30 and possibly other galaxy properties , while simultaneously predicting a set of kennicutt - schmidt laws .    if the line luminosity depended strongly on @xmath46 or @xmath41 , or",
    "if one required knowledge of the temperature to compute the infrared luminosity of a galaxy , we would would have no alternative to constructing such a model if we wished to explain the observed ir - line luminosity correlation .",
    "however , we can avoid this by relying on the observationally - calibrated star formation - ir correlation , and because , as we show in figures [ sfrl ] , [ fig : l ] , and [ fig : lm ] , the line luminosity varies quite weakly over a reasonable range of @xmath46 and @xmath41 for our chosen lines .",
    "for this reason , any model for computing @xmath46 and @xmath41 as a function of galaxy properties , if it were consistent with observations , would not significantly alter the ir - line luminosity correlation we derive .",
    "this is true , however , only for lines that require low temperatures to excite . as we discuss in   [ isothermality ] , lines that require higher temperatures to excite",
    "do depend sensitively on the temparature in the galaxy , and a model capable of predicting the ir - line luminosity correlation for these lines must also include a calculation of the temperature structure of the galaxy .",
    "our assumption of isothermality means that our analysis will only apply to molecular lines for which the temperature @xmath188 corresponding to the upper state energy is @xmath189 k , low enough to be excited even in the coolest molecular clouds in normal spiral galaxies .",
    "the reason for this is that at temperatures larger than @xmath188 , the luminosity in a line generally varies at most linearly with the temperature .",
    "as the similarity between the results with our different galaxy models illustrates , changing the temperature within the range of @xmath190 k produces only a factor of a few change in the luminosity of the lines we have studied .",
    "in contrast , line luminosity responds exponentially to temperature changes when the temperature is below the value corresponding to the upper state s energy .",
    "this means that lines sensitive to high temperatures pick out primarily the regions that are warm enough for the line to be excited .",
    "density has only a secondary effect .",
    "the emission will therefore reflect the temperature distribution in star - forming clouds more than the density distribution , an effect that our isothermal assumption precludes us from treating .",
    "ks laws in high temperature tracers are likely to find linear relationships between star formation rate and mass regardless of the critical density of the molecule in question because they will simply be correlating the mass of dust warmed to @xmath191 kelvin , which is essentially what is measured by @xmath140 , with the mass of gas warmed to temperatures above @xmath188 .",
    "however , our model will not apply to these lines , and for this reason we do not attempt to compare to observations using higher transitions of co ( @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and @xmath196 , which have @xmath197 , and @xmath198 k , respectively ; @xcite , @xcite ) , cs(@xmath194 ) ( @xmath199 k ; @xcite ) , or other high temperature tracers .",
    "we have not considered density - dependent variations in molecule abundances .",
    "one potential source of variation in molecular abundance is freeze - out onto grain surfaces at high densities and low temperatures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "chemodynamical models suggest that freeze - out is not likely to become significant for either carbonaceous or nitrogenous species until densities @xmath200 @xmath32 @xcite , but may become severe at higher densities , so whether depletion is significant depends on what fraction of the total luminosity would be contributed by gas of this density or higher were there no freeze - out .",
    "figure [ dldlogn ] suggests that freeze - out is likely to modify the total galactic luminosity of co , hco@xmath1 , and hcn fairly little even at a mean ism density of @xmath132 @xmath32 , but may have significant effects for galaxies of larger mean densities or for lines for which the critical densities is comparable to the freeze - out density .",
    "if freeze - out is significant , our conclusions will be modified .      in the simple model developed here , we have neglected the role of atomic gas entirely .",
    "whether the density or surface density of atomic gas plays a role in controlling the star formation rate is subject to debate on both observational and theoretical grounds @xcite , so it is unclear how much a limitation this omission really is .",
    "we can say with confidence that in molecule - rich galaxies , which provide almost all the dynamic range of both the @xcite correlation and the correlations illustrated in figures [ fig : l ] and [ fig : lm ] , the atomic gas plays almost no role simply because there is so little of it .",
    "thus , our predictions should be quite robust , except perhaps at the very low luminosity ends of figures [ fig : l ] and [ fig : lm ] .",
    "a final point is not so much a limitation of our work as a cautionary note about comparing our model with observations .",
    "we have included in our model ir luminosity only from star formation , and molecular line luminosity only from molecules in cold star - forming clouds . however",
    ", an agn may make a significant contribution to a galaxy s luminosity in the far infrared by direct heating of dust grains , and in molecular lines via an x - ray dissociation region .",
    "indeed , several of the systems with the highest ir luminosities in figures [ fig : l ] and [ fig : lm ] are contaminated by agn . as noted in  [ obscomparison ] , this complicates an assessment of our prediction of an up - turn in the @xmath174 and @xmath201 correlations at high luminosity .",
    "this deviation from linearity at high gas density ( at fixed @xmath160 , high @xmath140 ) is an essential prediction of our model , but testing it relies on a careful separation of the contribution of the agn to both the ir and line luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , @xcite discuss the possibility that the agn s contribution to the ir luminosity in these systems causes them to be above the local linear @xmath174 correlation .",
    "such a contamination would mimic the prediction of our model .",
    "however , @xcite argue that the sub - millimeter galaxies in their sample are not agn dominated and that just one of three quasars in their sample ( apm 08279 + 5255 ) has a large agn ir component .",
    "see @xcite for more discussion . for these reasons",
    "we contend that although our model is consistent with the existing data , the current evidence for a break in the @xmath174 correlation should be viewed with caution and more data in high density / luminosity systems is clearly required to understand the role of agn contamination in shaping the correlation .",
    "we provide a simple model for understanding how kennicutt - schmidt laws , which relate the star formation rate to the mass or surface density of gas as inferred from some particular line , depend on the line chosen to define the correlation .",
    "we show that for a turbulent medium the luminosity per unit volume in a given line , provided that line can be excited at temperatures lower than the mean temperature in a galaxy s molecular clouds , increases faster than linearly with the density for molecules with critical densities larger than the median gas density .",
    "the star formation rate also rises super - linearly with the gas density , and the combination of these two effects produces a close to linear correlation between star formation rate and line luminosity .",
    "in contrast , the line luminosity rises only linearly with density for lines with low critical densities , producing a correlation between star formation rate and line luminosity that is super - linear .",
    "based on this analysis , we construct a model for the correlation between a galaxy s infrared luminosity and its luminosity in a particular molecular line .",
    "our model is extremely simple , in that it relies on an observationally - calibrated ir - star formation rate correlation , it treats molecular clouds as having homogenous density and velocity distributions , temperatures , and chemical compositions , and it only very crudely accounts for variations in molecular cloud properties across galaxies . despite these approximations ,",
    "the model naturally explains why some observed correlations between infrared luminosity and line luminosity in galaxies are linear , and some are super - linear .",
    "using it , we are able to compute quantitatively the correlation between infrared and hcn(@xmath0 ) line luminosity , and between ir and co(@xmath0 ) line luminosity . we show that our model provides a very good fit to observations in these lines , and we are able to make similar predictions for any molecular line that can be excited at low temperatures , as we demonstrate for the example of hco@xmath1(@xmath0 ) .",
    "moreover , we are able to explain the observed data without recourse to the hypothesis that the star formation process is somehow different , either more or less efficient , in different types of galaxies or for media of different densities . instead",
    ", our model is able to explain the observed correlations using a simple , universal star formation law .",
    "one strong prediction of our model is that there should be a break from linear to non - linear scaling in the hcn - ir correlation at very high ir luminosity , and a similar break in the hco@xmath1-ir correlation at somewhat lower luminosity .",
    "the data for hco@xmath1 are consistent with this prediction but do not yet strongly favor a break over pure powerlaw behavior . however , there is some preliminary evidence for a break in the ir - hcn correlation in high redshift galaxies more luminous than any found in the local universe , although with these high redshift observations it is difficult to rule out the alternative explanation of the break as arising due to a progressively rising agn contribution to the ir luminosity ( see  [ obscomparison ] and  [ agn ] ) .",
