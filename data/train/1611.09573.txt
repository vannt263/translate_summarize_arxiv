    "due to rapid growth of text producing and consuming applications , numerous tools and techniques were introduced in the recent past for extracting useful patterns from unstructured text .",
    "these patterns are crucial for organizations to discover knowledge out of it and aid in making intelligent decisions .",
    "as the amount of such data grows exponentially , already available algorithms performs poor on the scalability and performance aspects .",
    "but there are still a lot of avenues where text data is yet to be exploited fully and thus we need new and efficient algorithms to tackle this situation .",
    "platforms such as social networks , e - commerce websites , blogs and research journals generate such data in the form of unstructured text and it is essential to analyze , synthesis and process such data for efficient retrieval of useful information . + in text mining , concepts are defined as a sequence of words that constitute real or imaginary entities .",
    "extraction of such entities are non - trivial for applications such as automated ontology generation @xcite , document summarization @xcite and aspect oriented sentiment analysis @xcite to name a few .",
    "this is the era of data explosion thus it is very difficult to store , process , manage and most importantly to extract knowledge out of it . to overcome this shortfall ,",
    "a significant amount of research has been carried out in the recent past for leveraging underlying thematic and semantic structure from text archives . as a result a good number of algorithmic techniques were introduced which are proved to be efficient for the discovery of themes and semantics underlying high dimensional data .",
    "+ topic models are suite of text understanding algorithms which statistically generate latent themes pervade a large collection of unstructured text . since its inception , text mining researchers and practitioners are using it extensively to analyze and organize large document collections .",
    "they are unsupervised learning algorithms thus it does not require user tagged corpus to work with .",
    "a large number of topic modeling algorithms have been reported in the past with the difference in the assumption they make for modeling topics .",
    "models such as probabilistic topic models @xcite and latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) are some such flavors of topic modeling that attained significant attention .",
    "+ @xmath0 this work proposes a novel unsupervised approach for learning concept hierarchies from large unstructured text corpus which is guided by a probabilistic topic modeling approach . to begin with",
    ", we model topics from the corpus using latent dirichlet allocation ( lda ) algorithm and then uses a lightweight linguistic process to identify concepts which are close to the real world understanding .",
    "then we make use of a subsumption relation @xcite ( `` is - a '' ) to connect concepts which are related thus forms a hierarchy of concepts . + @xmath1 the rest of this paper",
    "is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly review related works in section 2 .",
    "section 3 introduces the novel approach we have proposed .",
    "detailed explanation of the implementation details is presented in section 4 , and the evaluation of the proposed method is discussed in section 5 . and",
    "finally we draw a conclusion and discuss future work in section 6 .",
    "here , we define the problem formally . given a large corpus containing unstructured text documents , our problem is to automatically generate concept hierarchies which are close to human understanding . in a nutshell , this paper aims to answer the following research questions :    1 .",
    "is it possible to automatically extract human interpretable concepts from statistically generated topics using a lightweight linguistic process ?",
    "2 .   can our proposed method learn a hierarchy of such concepts incorporating a subsumption relation between them , which are important in automated ontology generation ?",
    "3 .   given a large but unstructured text corpus ,",
    "can our topic modeling guided method better extracts and learns concept hierarchies compared to existing algorithms ?",
    "many recent works have been reported in this direction which proposed many algorithms to extract semantically rich concepts from plain text . in the following section , we due acknowledge some past literatures that discusses methods which are close to our proposed algorithm .    * notations used in this paper : * to help narrative , some commonly used notations are shown in table 1 that are used in the rest of this paper .",
    ".notations used in subsequent sections [ cols=\">,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "this paper proposed a novel framework for extracting close to real world concepts from large collection of unstructured text documents which is guided by a probabilistic topic modeling algorithm .",
    "proposed method also deals with learning a subsumption hierarchy which exploits `` is - a '' relationships among identified concepts which is extensively used in ontology generation .",
    "experiments conducted on large datasets such as reuters and bbc news corpus shows that the proposed method outperforms some of the already available algorithms and better concept identification is possible with this framework .",
    "+ because of the promising end results , we are interested to work mainly on the directions of measuring the scalability of proposed framework by using more large datasets . apart from the basic subsumption hierarchy which depicts ``",
    "is - a '' relation , our future work will be on leveraging other relations that exist between concepts we would like to so that a this framework can automate the complete ontology generation process .",
