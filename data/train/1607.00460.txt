    "it was observed in @xcite that the fitting method failed to accurately predict conduit dsw soliton edge speeds for sufficiently large jump heights .",
    "our results here suggest that this could be due to the loss of strict hyperbolicity and/or genuine nonlinearity in the small wavenumber ( soliton train ) regime .",
    "in addition to the hyperbolic modulation regime where dsws , and dark envelope solitons are the prominent coherent structures , we have found an elliptic regime where the periodic wave breaks up into coherent wavepackets or bright envelope solitons .",
    "the accessibility of both hyperbolic and elliptic modulation regimes in one system motivates further study of each and the transition between the two .",
    "one potential future , novel direction is to explore the possibility of creating a soliton gas @xcite .",
    "it remains to generate a periodic wave from an initially constant conduit and explore its properties experimentally .",
    "accurate control of wavebreaking has been achieved by slow modulation of the conduit area from a boundary @xcite .",
    "one possibility is to utilize simple wave solutions of the whitham equations to efficiently and smoothly transition between a constant conduit @xmath199 to a periodic conduit @xmath139 .",
    "this also suggests the theoretical and experimental exploration of riemann problems , step initial data , for the whitham equations themselves .",
    "our determination of linearly degenerate curves will inform the ability to construct simple waves connecting two generic wave states .",
    "although our direct numerical simulations suggest that envelope solitons are long - lived , their physical realization may be challenging .",
    "existing laboratory studies of viscous fluid conduits implement control of the conduit interface by varying the injected flow rate through a nozzle at the bottom of a fluid column .",
    "this allows for the creation of waves with positive ( upward ) propagation velocities .",
    "while some dark solitons have a positive velocity , all bright envelope solitons propagate with negative velocity .",
    "additionally , it has been found to be difficult to image small amplitude excitations so that the observation of weakly nonlinear dynamics may be challenging .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental creation of periodic conduit waves and envelope solitons is possible .",
    "we have shown that the non - convexity of the conduit linear dispersion relation leads to the existence of elliptic whitham equations and modulational instability .",
    "this is just one possible implication of non - convex dispersion in dispersive hydrodynamics .",
    "we note that non - convex dispersion in other , higher order equations , has also been found to give rise to a resonance between the dsw soliton edge and linear waves , leading to the generation of radiating dsws @xcite .",
    "this study has identified and categorized modulations of periodic traveling waves for the conduit equation .",
    "these findings , along with previous theoretical and experimental studies of solitons and dsws imply that the viscous fluid conduit system is an accessible environment in which to investigate rich and diverse nonlinear wave phenomena .",

    "the amplitude constraint @xmath210 closes the system of equations .",
    "we precondition the spectral equations by dividing each by the sum of linear coefficients , shifted by @xmath211 , i.e. , by @xmath212 .",
    "the accurate resolution of each solution is maintained by achieving an absolute tolerance of @xmath213 in the 2-norm of the residual and choosing @xmath207 so that @xmath214 is below @xmath215 for @xmath216 .",
    "the number of coefficients required strongly depends on the wavenumber @xmath105 .",
    "for example , when @xmath217 , we find @xmath218 provides sufficient accuracy whereas for @xmath219 , we use @xmath220 .    with the cosine series coefficients of @xmath200 in hand , we compute the unit - mean averaging integrals @xmath161 , @xmath221 in eqs .  , using the spectrally accurate trapezoidal rule .",
