    "instead of going through the trouble of creating the complex and fragile quantum states necessary for the quantum enhancements of quantum metrology , some protocols have been proposed that use easy to create and robust classical states , and then filter ( post - select ) the high - resolution states at the measurement stage .",
    "the basic idea is to employ retrodiction  @xcite : once a high - resolution quantum state has been detected at the output , one can interpret the whole experiment as having employed such a state since the input .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the wave - function collapse can be placed at an arbitrary time between probe preparation and measurement  @xcite .",
    "the filtering intrinsic in such protocols implies that part of the resources available at the onset are wasted : the system is sampled with many more resources than those actually employed for the parameter estimation .",
    "moreover , since the system is sampled with classical states that present no quantum correlations , it is clear from the preceding sections that the sql can not be beaten : there is no increase in resolution over the optimal _ classical _ strategy that could employ _ all _ the resources ( without filtering ) .",
    "for this reason , filtering protocols can not be considered proper quantum metrology protocols , according to the definition we have given above .",
    "nonetheless they can be extremely useful in the common case when the optimal classical strategy that employs all the resources that have sampled the system is impractical .",
    "moreover , in practical situations efficiency considerations rarely play a role , whereas robustness to noise is paramount .",
    "classical states are , by definition , the most robust ones . in addition",
    ", there are situations where filtering methods achieve tasks that would be impossible with purely classical strategies , and post - selecting on the high - resolution quantum states is often very simple .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the theory of filtering protocols for phase estimation is developed , and necessary conditions are given to distinguish super - sensitivity ( i.e.  the error in the estimation is lower than allowed using classical resources ) from super - resolution ( i.e.  the error in the estimation is lower than what would be allowed by a classical procedure that uses only the resources that the filtering retains ) .",
    "filtering protocols can achieve super - resolution ( with an appropriate measuring strategy ) but can not achieve the super - sensitivity of quantum metrology proper .",
    "several authors  @xcite have recently considered the possibility of using nonlinear effects to go beyond the @xmath88 heisenberg - like scalings in phase estimation problems .",
    "these new regimes have been called `` super - heisenberg '' scalings in ref .",
    "@xcite , but a proper accounting of the resources shows that they are fully compatible with the analysis presented in the previous sections , see e.g. ref .",
    "ultimately the idea of these proposals is to consider settings where the unitary transformation that `` writes '' the unknown parameter @xmath5 into the probing signals , is characterized by many - body hamiltonian generators which are no longer extensive functions of the number of probes employed in the estimation  @xcite or , for the optical implementations which yielded the inequality  ( [ qcrn33 ] ) , in the photon number operator of the input signals  @xcite .",
    "consequently , in these setups , the mapping @xmath89 which acts on the input states @xmath46 , gets replaced by a transformations of the form @xmath90 which couples the probes non trivially . accordingly",
    "the minimization of eq .",
    "( [ qcrn33 ] ) is no longer forced to obey to the inequality  ( [ qcrn44 ] ) .",
    "for instance , rmse with scalings of the order @xmath91 can be obtained when using hamiltonians that involves @xmath92-system interactions between the probes  @xcite , while @xmath93 scaling can be achieved by introducing an exponentially large number of coupling terms  @xcite .",
    "proposed implementations include scattering in bose condensates  @xcite , duffing nonlinearity in nano - mechanical resonators  @xcite , two - pass effective nonlinearity with an atomic ensemble  @xcite , kerr - like nonlinearities  @xcite , and nonlinear quantum atom - light interfaces  @xcite .",
    "the study of noisy quantum metrology is a special case of parameter estimation for channels , where the map @xmath42 which describes the encoding of the unknown parameter @xmath5 , contains also the description of the noise tampering with the process .",
    "hence , even though very few general results are known , many results detailed in the previous sections can be used to characterize noise effects .",
    "non trivial examples are known where a heisenberg scaling can be retained even in the presence of noise  @xcite . on the other hand a simple application of the programmable criterion of ref .",
    "@xcite shows that even a small amount of depolarizing noise is sufficient to ruin any sub - shot - noise performances one could reach by entangling the probing systems .",
    "typical quantum metrology protocols are indeed extremely sensitive to noise . for instance , the incoherent loss of a single photon in a noon state transforms it into a statistical mixture @xmath94 which is useless for phase - sensing .",
    "such extreme sensitivity to losses implies that this state can not be used in any practical situation  @xcite .",
    "is it then really possible to outperform classical strategies in practical phase sensing  @xcite ?",
    "surprisingly , it has been shown that asymptotically it is possible to do so only by a constant factor  @xcite : for any nonzero loss , for sufficiently high number of photons @xmath54 the scaling of the optimal phase sensing is proportional to the scaling of the shot noise @xmath95 .",
    "while this means that quantum approaches are useful in highly controlled environments  @xcite ( such as for gravitational wave detection  @xcite ) , they only allow for very small enhancements in free - space target acquisition  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the shot noise can be beaten  @xcite and the optimal states to do so in the presence of loss have been calculated numerically using various optimization techniques for fixed number of input photons  @xcite and for photon - number detection  @xcite . a post - selected proof of principle experiment that employs some of these optimal states",
    "was recently performed  @xcite .",
    "note that , for very low values of loss , noon states retain their optimality  @xcite , and can be approximated by states that are easy to generate  @xcite .",
    "also , a very simple proposal based on parametric downconversion which can be realized without post - selection was proposed in  @xcite : it can achieve the heisenberg bound for low loss and degrades gracefully with noise . in the case",
    "in which there is a large amount of loss _",
    "after _ the sample has interacted with the light probe , even achieving the shot noise limit might become cumbersome ( most of the photons that interacted with the phase shifter and contain phase information are lost ) . a simple strategy that amplifies the signal before detection and can asymptotically achieve the shot noise was experimentally tested in  @xcite . in contrast , the optimal states for the sequential ( or multi - round ) interferometry  @xcite have not been obtained so far in the presence of noise  @xcite . however , as an alternative to the fragile two - mode states , some more robust single mode states were also analyzed , e.g. pure gaussian states in the presence of phase diffusion  @xcite , mixed gaussian states in the presence of loss  @xcite , or single mode variants of the two mode states  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the two mode case ( where the phase is the relative one between the two modes ) here the phase is measured relative to a strong classical signal ( using heterodyne or homodyne measurements ) or similar strategies .    historically , the first analysis of a quantum metrology protocol  @xcite in the presence of noise was performed in  @xcite , where frequency measurements are analyzed in the presence of dephasing .",
    "interestingly , a phase transition was shown : for any nonzero value of dephasing , the maximally entangled state suddenly ceases to present any advantage over a classically correlated state .",
    "( an analogous result for magnetometry exists  @xcite . ) we briefly present this result , as it is instructive of the subtleties encountered by quantum metrology when noise sources are considered .",
    "consider the ramsey setup of fig .  [",
    "f : ramsey ] when a dephasing process acts on the atomic probes . for the conventional setup the probability of finding the probe in the initial state after the application of the phase shift becomes @xmath96 , where @xmath97 measures the dephasing rate and @xmath98 is the time elapsed from the state preparation up to the measurement readout .",
    "analogously , for the quantum setting we get @xmath99 , where the factor @xmath54 in the exponent derives from the exponentially greater sensitivity of the entangled state to the dephasing . the corresponding rmse ( using the equations derived in fig .",
    "[ f : ramsey ] ) is @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath102 they are both minimized for @xmath103 ( namely , we have to use a measurement procedure which is as fast as possible ) , and one recovers the typical @xmath104 enhancement of quantum metrology also in the presence of dephasing . however",
    ", if one wants to measure a frequency  @xcite @xmath105 , then the phase factor is @xmath106 . in this case , the errors of the separable and entangled procedure are respectively @xmath107 and @xmath108 . for @xmath109",
    ", we have @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the optimization over @xmath98 says that our measurement must be as long as possible .",
    "choosing the same @xmath98 in the two cases , the entangled protocol is @xmath112 more precise .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath102 the two situations can not be anymore optimized on the same @xmath98 .",
    "for example , if the frequency is @xmath113 , it is easy to see that one has to choose @xmath114 to optimize the separable procedure and @xmath115 to optimize the entangled one . with these choices ,",
    "one obtains for the two cases @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "we must assign equal resources to the two protocols , so we can repeat times the entangled procedure @xmath54 times as it is @xmath54 times faster .",
    "this recovers a factor @xmath118 also for the entangled procedure , whose error then matches the separable one , @xmath119 . in",
    "@xcite it is shown that using non - maximally entangled states one can beat the separable procedure by @xmath120 , which was proven to be the ultimate gain .",
    "summarizing , the estimation of the phase @xmath6 is unaffected by the presence of dephasing noise ( as long as the measurement time @xmath98 can be chosen short enough ) : the full @xmath121 enhancement of quantum metrology is retained . on the contrary ,",
    "the estimation of the frequency @xmath122 is strongly affected by the same noise : basically all quantum enhancement is lost for any value of @xmath123 .",
    "this is connected to the fragility of the entangled resource in the presence of noise : the entangled procedure must be performed @xmath54 times faster , which reduces the precision in the estimation of @xmath105 by a factor @xmath54 , thus achieving the same final yield as the separable protocol .",
    "note , however , that if the observation time @xmath124 in atomic clocks is constrained by experimental issues ( typically , by the local oscillator fluctuations ) , then entanglement allows a sub - shot noise scaling  @xcite which scales as @xmath125  @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the frequency measurement theory was given in  @xcite , which covers many noisy estimation measurements when the measurement duration time and production rate of the probes are considered as relevant resources .",
