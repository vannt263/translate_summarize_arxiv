    "first , we have to note for co and mi that there is no contribution from the one spin wave excitation modes , i.e. , @xmath207 . for sf",
    ", two excitation bands contribute to the spin - spin correlation as seen in fig.[fig : spin - spin](a)(c ) , since there is no band folding .",
    "around @xmath132 , the excitations consist of a nambu - goldstone ( ng ) mode ( whose intensity grows linearly with @xmath208 ) , and a massive mode ( whose intensity grows as @xmath209 ) , and we also find a roton mode around ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "such behaviors match those of the dynamical structure factor in the boson systems @xcite .",
    "as can be seen in fig.[fig : spin - spin](f ) , which shows the intensity of peak against @xmath63 at the zone boundary @xmath211 , the intensity rapidly increases toward the sf / ss or sf / co boundaries .",
    "this can be regarded as a hallmark for the phase transition for ss or co.    if we turn to the ss state in fig.[fig : spin - spin](b),(d),(e ) , there are four single particle excitations that contribute to the spin - spin correlation . since the @xmath58 symmetry is broken in ss , the selection rule for the matrix elements appearing in eqns([eq : cz],[eq : cpm ] )",
    "is the same for ( @xmath212 ) as that for ( @xmath213 ) , so that the ng mode in fig.[fig : spin - spin](b ) appears both around @xmath187 and @xmath214 .",
    "it turns out that the intensity of the 4th band in the ss phase rapidly decreases toward the boundary to co. the intensity of this band is much weaker than those for the other bands in the ss region . at long wave lengths ( @xmath215 ) ,",
    "the intensity also starts from 0 in most part of the ss state .",
    "only the ng mode has an intensity increasing linearly with @xmath208 , while the other three modes increase like @xmath209 .",
    "just after the transition to the ss state in fig.[fig : spin - spin](e ) , the dominant excitations are the lowest two modes . away from the phase boundary in fig.[fig : spin - spin](d ) , the intensities of the lowest three modes become comparable with each other .",
    "the fact that the massive mode ( the 3rd excitation mode around ( 0,0)@xmath216*bz*/2 ) ) has a significant intensity for the @xmath217 correlation function reflects the property of the mode that it becomes coupled with the density modulation in ss .",
    "we also find that the intensity of the ng mode vanishes at the zone boundary in ss .",
    "this reflects the fact that zero - energy excitation is only coupled with the phase oscillation of the order parameter .",
    "another characteristic property is that the intensity is stronger around ( @xmath210 ) than around ( @xmath218 ) when we compare ( @xmath212)@xmath216*bz*/2 and ( @xmath213)@xmath219*bz*/2 .",
    "therefore the bands can be observed more clearly around ( @xmath210 ) as seen in fig.[fig : spin - spin](b ) .     for single spin wave states in the @xmath198 correlation with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",

    "figure [ fig : spin - spin_pm ] shows the intensity ( @xmath225 ) for @xmath224 along @xmath206 . as seen in eq.([eq : pm_detail ] ) , single spin wave states contribute to the matrix element in the insulating phases ( mi , co ) .",
    "it turns out that in mi(@xmath125 ) in fig.[fig : spin - spin_pm](a ) , only the second excitation band has a significant intensity , which does not depend on @xmath63 within the present approximation . in the co state in fig.[fig : spin - spin_pm](d ) , we can see two bands in the spectrum , i.e. , the 1st band ( the 2nd at higher @xmath63 ) and the 3rd band ( fig.[fig : spin - spin_pm](d ) ) .",
    "namely , as @xmath63 increases in co , the two bands change their orders , hence the nature of the 1st and 2nd bands changes .",
    "this can be seen in fig.[fig : spin - spin_pm](e)(f ) , where the intensity of the 1st band is finite at lower @xmath63 in co , while the intensity of the 2nd band is finite at higher @xmath63 . in mi(@xmath138 ) , only the first band is observed , whose intensity is @xmath226 throughout ( not shown ) . in the sf phase , both bands have contributions to @xmath224 .",
    "an interesting observation is that the intensity to the ng mode diverges like @xmath227 toward @xmath214 .",
    "therefore , the ng mode is expected to be observed clearly . as for the roton mode , its intensity increases near the boundary of sf / ss or sf / co , see fig.[fig : spin - spin_pm](b)(e ) .",
    "this increase is a precursor to the breakdown of @xmath58 symmetry . in the ss phase in fig.[fig : spin - spin_pm](c ) , the ng mode becomes intense toward @xmath228 . in this phase ,",
    "the intensity of the 1st band diverges like @xmath229 at @xmath132 and like @xmath227 at @xmath230 . on the other hand",
    ", it turns out that the intensities of the 2nd to 4th bands in the ss phase strongly depend on ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "given the correspondence between the bose hubbard model and the spin system , these characteristic behaviors in ss revealed here can be expected in cold atoms in optical lattice as well .",
    "in this paper we have studied the frustrated spin dimer model with the bond operator and the generalized spin wave theory .",
    "first we have obtained the phase diagram , which can be directly compared with that of the extended bose hubbard model .",
    "we have revealed how the supersolid state emerges in this model , and found that there is a phase (  sf \" ) which involves @xmath31 state and hence has no counterpart in the bose hubbard model .",
    "in addition , we point out that enlarged ss region for large v ( @xmath232 ) in the bose hubbard model does not occur in the spin model , because  sf \" phase takes over instead .",
    "second , we have obtained the excitation modes , especially the excitation spectra around the ss regions .",
    "we have found that the dip corresponding to a roton mode completely softens at the boundary of ss , and that a nambu - goldstone mode has a linear dispersion even in the ss state .",
    "we have also microscopically derived within the generalized linear spin wave theory an analytical relation between the velocity of the ng mode , order parameter and spin susceptibility , which agrees with the relation derived from hydrostatic treatments . as for the properties of the excitation modes",
    ", it turns out that , in the sf state , the massive mode does not couple with density modulations , while in the ss state there is a coupling .",
    "third , we have calculated the spin - spin correlations @xmath217 and @xmath224 .",
    "@xmath217 corresponds in the bose system to the dynamical structure factor , while @xmath224 to the lesser green s function . in the sf state ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath217 is similar to its counterpart for cold atoms .",
    "the resonance of the intensity of the roton mode is thought to be a precursor to the breaking of @xmath58 symmetry ( phase transition to co or ss ) . in the ss state ,",
    "the intensity of the ng ( sound ) mode peak vanishes at the boundary of the 1st brillouin zone , while the 3rd excitation band becomes significant , which reflects the property of the difference in the excitation between ss and sf mentioned above . as for @xmath224 ,",
    "the spin wave theory predicts that some of the bands have significant intensities in the insulating phases ( mi , co ) . on the other hand , the ng mode is expected to be clearly observed in the spin - spin correlation , while the intensity of the roton mode can be regard as an evidence for the phase transition to co or ss . the properties of ss revealed here for the spin model should be applicable to the ss phase in bose systems .",

    "as far as @xmath282 is normalized the equation of motion introduced in the 1st step is expressed as @xmath283 with @xmath284 .",
    "however the evolution of the state with eq.([eq : arb ] ) does not depend on the choice of @xmath276 .",

    "when we look at eq.([eq : gutzeom2 ] ) , we notice that the evolution of the coefficients does not depend on the @xmath297 component . therefore ,",
    "when we consider the stationary solution around the ground state , we only have to deal with an eigenvalue problem for the @xmath298 components , and then we can decide the evolution of the @xmath297 component . as in the 1st step ,",
    "we try to find the solution with the form @xmath299 then the eigenvalue problem for the @xmath298 components reads @xmath300 where @xmath301 and @xmath302 are @xmath303 , @xmath304 and @xmath305 by directly evaluating @xmath306 and @xmath307 , one can see that the matrix in eq.([eq : gutzexcitation2 ] ) is nothing but @xmath308 .",
    "therefore the method introduced in the 1st step gives the same excitation spectrum as in the spin wave theory introduced in the main part of this paper .",
