    "coherent and squeezed states are known to be very important in many fields of physics .",
    "coherent states were discovered in 1926 by schrdinger @xcite , while squeezed states were introduced by kennard in 1927 @xcite .",
    "however , these works were , in the main , ignored or forgotten until the sixties , when these states became very popular and received a lot of attention from both fields , mathematics and physics . among many important papers ,",
    "let us mention the works of glauber @xcite , klauder @xcite , and nieto @xcite . in the particular field of quantum optics , the books of walls and milburn @xcite , gazeau @xcite and rand @xcite are very good reading which also consider the applications .",
    "the study of squeezed states for systems admitting an infinite discrete spectrum , obtained as a generalisation of coherent states , has been recently the center of much attention ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in modern developments , coherent states ( cs )",
    "are standardly defined in three equivalent ways : displacement operator method , ladder ( annihilation ) operator method and minimum uncertainty method ( for review see for example @xcite ) .",
    "initially defined for the case of the harmonic oscillator , coherent states have been generalised for other systems .",
    "we can use , for example , the definition of klauder @xcite saying that they are obtained as the following superposition of energy eigenstates @xmath0 @xmath1 the sum is taken over all the discrete values of @xmath2 and the set @xmath3 is usually infinite .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 is a complex variable in general , @xmath5 is a normalization factor and @xmath6 is a set of strictly positive parameters , usually depending on the energy of the system under consideration .",
    "these last quantities correspond to a moment problem ( see @xcite for details ) .    for a quantum system which admits an infinite discrete spectrum @xmath7 and ladder operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 acting on the energy eigenstates as @xmath10",
    "these coherent states are defined as eigenstates of @xmath8 .",
    "we thus get @xcite @xmath11 note that the quantity @xmath12 is not unique and can be chosen to impose additional constraints to the ladder operators . in particular , for the harmonic oscillator , we have @xmath13 , @xmath14 = \\mathbb{i } , \\quad h_{ho}=\\hbar \\omega ( a^+ a^- + { 1\\over 2}),\\ ] ] and the expression ( [ genecs ] ) gives the usual coherent states .",
    "now , for a quantum system which admits a finite discrete spectrum like the one which involves the morse potential , various constructions of coherent states have been adapted @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have used ladder operators @xcite to construct different types of coherent states of the morse potential and have compared them with the so - called gaussian coherent states @xcite . in particular , such a construction has been inspired by the approach mentioned above ( see formula ( [ genecs ] ) ) but where the set @xmath3 of values of @xmath2 is now finite .",
    "the coherent states are not exactly eigenstates of the annihilation operator @xmath8 but we have shown @xcite that , in practice , the last terms on the right hand side of the sum in ( [ genecs ] ) does not contribute significantly . in some approaches ( see , for example , @xcite ) these states are called pseudo - coherent states .    to our knowledge , squeezed coherent states for the morse potential have not been constructed .",
    "the aim of this paper is thus to show that such a construction can be closely related to the one for infinite spectrum systems .",
    "in fact , these states would be almost eigenstates of a linear combination of the ladder operators .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate using numerical evaluations that one set of these states , the energy - like , behave properly as squeezed states .    in section 2",
    "we give a review of relevant results on squeezed coherent states and minimal uncertainty relations for a quantum system with infinite spectrum . in section 3 , starting with the definition of the morse model and its ladder operators , we define the corresponding squeezed coherent states .",
    "we thus get two types of the states called oscillator - like and energy - like . in section 4 , we show that the energy - like states have stable trajectories in the phase space and minimize the uncertainty relation . due to the complexity of the expressions of those states ,",
    "numerical calculations are used .",
    "we end the paper with conclusions in section 5 .",
    "as in the case of harmonic oscillator , general squeezed coherent states @xcite , for a quantum system with an infinite discrete energy spectrum , may be constructed as the solutions of the eigenvalue equation : @xmath15 the mixing of @xmath8 and @xmath9 is said to be controlled by a squeezing parameter @xmath16 and @xmath4 is called the coherent parameter .",
    "the coherent states are special solutions when @xmath17 .",
    "conditions on @xmath16 must be imposed for the states to be normalisable .    squeezed coherent states ( scs ) based on @xmath18 or @xmath19 algebras @xcite and also direct sums of these algebras with the algebra @xmath20 @xcite ,",
    "have been constructed using group theoretical methods .",
    "this involves , in particular , the operators displacement @xmath21 and squeezing @xmath22 similar to the ones of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "in fact , for @xmath18 or @xmath19 algebras , @xmath23 is a quadratic function of @xmath2 .    more generally , equation ( [ eigenequa1 ] ) may be solved by using a direct expansion of @xmath24 in the form @xmath25 with @xmath26 where @xmath27 is given by ( [ rho ] ) . indeed , for the case @xmath28 , inserting ( [ kfact ] ) into ( [ eigenequa1 ] ) , we get a 3-term recurrence relation @xmath29 and without restriction , we take @xmath30 and thus @xmath31 .    for the harmonic oscillator , @xmath32 and we get explicitly @xcite : @xmath33}{\\frac{n!}{i !

    "\\label{scsho}\\ ] ] it is well - known that @xmath34 for the states to be normalizable in this case . in ( [ scsho ] ) , we see that the hermite polynomials @xmath35 take values on @xmath36 .",
    "these polynomials have interesting properties in terms of orthogonality , measure and resolution of the identity @xcite .    for the harmonic oscillator , these states minimize the schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation @xcite which becomes the usual heisenberg uncertainty relation for @xmath16 real .",
    "indeed , we get @xmath37 and the uncertainty becomes @xmath38 we see that this implies the reduction of the `` quantum noise '' on one of the observables while increasing it on the other . in the following we will treat the case when the quantum noise is reduced on the observable @xmath39 because we want a good localisation in the position .",
    "the morse potential quantum system is a realistic model for studying vibrations of atoms in a diatomic molecule .",
    "since this system is very close to the harmonic oscillator , the squeezed coherent states will be constructed following the procedure given for the harmonic oscillator , but we will deal with a finite number of eigenstates .",
    "the one - dimensional morse model is given by the energy eigenvalue equation ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the reduced mass of the oscillating system composed of two atoms of masses @xmath42 and @xmath43 , _ i.e. _ @xmath44 .",
    "the potential is @xmath45 , where the space variable @xmath39 represents the displacement of the two atoms from their equilibrium positions , @xmath46 is a scaling energy constant representing the depth of the potential well at equilibrium @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the parameter of the model ( related to the characteristics of the well , such as its depth and width ) .",

    "the following shifted energies @xmath54 are useful for the construction of squeezed coherent states . using the change of variable @xmath55 , we get the energy eigenfunctions , for the discrete spectrum , in terms of associated laguerre polynomials , denoted by @xmath56 , as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a normalization factor given by @xmath59 since @xmath60 is related to physical parameters ( see ( [ epsilonnu ] ) ) , it is not an integer in practice and @xmath5 is never zero as expected . for many applications , it is convenient to introduce the number operator @xmath61 such that @xmath62 and we see from ( [ energies ] ) that @xmath63 can be in fact written as @xmath64 .",
    "the ladder operators of the morse system are defined as in ( [ ladder0 ] ) , however the set of eigenfunctions @xmath65 is finite . as mentioned in the introduction , the quantity @xmath23 in ( [ ladder0 ] ) is not unique and we consider two natural choices @xcite .",
    "the first choice , the `` oscillator - like '' , corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "the ladder operators satisfy a @xmath20 algebra .",

    "we then see that @xmath69 must behave as @xmath91 , which is exactly what we get from ( [ knoh ] ) and we find @xmath92 a similar calculation gives the expected limit for @xmath9 .",
