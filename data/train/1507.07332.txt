    "both the atlas and cms collaborations at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) have discovered a neutral boson whose properties are compatible with the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson @xcite .",
    "the next important goal is to understand the nature of the discovered higgs boson .",
    "meanwhile , to make precision measurement of higgs properties , the study of signals of higgs - boson production and their backgrounds is quite essential .",
    "the @xmath1 productions at the lhc can be used to determine the gauge boson couplings and will allow for a better understanding of the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking .",
    "their production cross sections are currently known up to the qcd next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "these production processes are basically backgrounds to the precision measurement of the higgs - boson production which is used to search for physics beyond the sm .",
    "since the precision measurements will be possible at the lhc run 2 , and the enormous luminosity is permitted to produce gauge bosons with large transverse momentum up to tev scale , the nlo ew corrections to these processes can receive large logarithmic contributions which originate from soft / collinear exchange of ew gauge bosons in loop diagrams .",
    "therefore , the ew correction could be strongly enhanced by the ew sudakov logarithms .",
    "the ew corrections to most of these processes are yet unknown , although they are certainly as important as qcd corrections in some colliding channels .",
    "the nlo qcd corrections to the @xmath2 production at the lhc for on - shell @xmath0-bosons were calculated in refs.@xcite . while the nlo ew corrections to this process with leptonic @xmath0-boson decays have not been investigated so far .",
    "it is believed that the calculations for the @xmath3 productions with subsequent vector - boson decays including the nlo qcd and nlo ew corrections at the lhc are desired , and one can find that this work is listed in the wishlist ( table 3 ) of ref.@xcite .    in this paper , we present the lo and nlo qcd+ew corrected integrated cross sections and some kinematic distributions for the @xmath4 process at the lhc , including the @xmath0-boson leptonic decays by adopting the naive narrow width approximation ( nwa ) and the madspin program .",
    "the nlo correction can be divided in @xmath5 ew and @xmath6 qcd corrections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : calculation ] , we provide a general setup of our calculation . in section  [ sec : num ] , we present the numerical results and discussion for the integrated and differential cross sections at the lo and nlo . finally , a short summary is given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "since the calculation strategy of the nlo qcd correction to the @xmath0-boson pair production in association with a hard jet at the lhc has already been provided in ref.@xcite , in this section we give mainly the description of the nlo ew calculation .",
    "we adopt the five - flavor scheme and neglect the masses of @xmath7- , @xmath8- , @xmath9- , @xmath10- , @xmath11-quark in both the nlo qcd and nlo ew calculations @xcite . since the long lifetime of bottom quark induces that its decay vertex is away from the primary production point with a resolvable distance , it is possible to exclude experimentally these contributions by supposing that the final @xmath11-quark jet can be tagged in principle . in other words , by employing @xmath11-tagging technique we can remove the @xmath12-@xmath13 events .    in the evaluation of the nlo",
    "qcd corrections in the five - flavor scheme , the singularity from final gluon splitting @xmath14 would be incorrectly removed by @xmath11-tagging , which should be originally canceled by that from the @xmath11-quark loop in the gluon self - energy .",
    "we deal with this problem in the way similar to that in ref.@xcite .",
    "we consider the two merged bottom quarks with @xmath15 as a `` light '' jet by adopting jet algorithm described in next section . if the two bottom quarks are separated as two individual jets ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) , we abandon this event due to the @xmath11-tagging .",
    "since the nlo qcd correction involves the contributions from the real light - quark emission subprocesses @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) which are related to the ckm matrix elements , we shall keep the non - diagonal cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix in the nlo qcd calculation . in this paper , we take the approximation that the ckm matrix has block - diagonal form allowing quark mixing only between the first two generations since the mixing to the third generation is negligible , i.e. , @xmath21 as explained in ref.@xcite , the lo contribution for the @xmath22 process is not influenced by the explicit entries of the ckm matrix due to the ckm unitarity .",
    "analogously , the ew one - loop amplitude for @xmath23 and the tree - level amplitude for @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) are dependent on the ckm matrix via only @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "these combinations of ckm matrix elements equal to @xmath28 after the summation over the intermediate quark flavors due to the ckm unitarity .",
    "therefore , the full nlo ew correction to the @xmath29 process is independent of the ckm matrix elements , and we set the ckm matrix to the identity in both the lo and nlo ew calculations .",
    "the @xmath30 production at the lo involves the following partonic processes , ( see fig.[fig : uuwwg ] for example ) @xmath31 in the partonic processes ( [ eqn : partonlo1])-([eqn : partonlo3 ] ) , @xmath32 stands for the light quarks ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) . because of the smallness of the ( anti)bottom - quark parton distribution function ( pdf ) in the proton ,",
    "the contributions of the subprocesses with initial @xmath11-quark , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , to the hadronic cross section are suppressed with respect to the subprocesses ( [ eqn : partonlo1])-([eqn : partonlo3 ] ) . as an example , the contribution to the lo total hardronic cross section from the subprocess @xmath37 at the @xmath38 lhc is less than @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to neglect the nlo ew corrections from the subprocesses involving initial @xmath11-quark in our calculation . since we perform the nlo ew calculation for the @xmath40 production at the lhc in a precision up to @xmath41 , the lowest order contributions from the partonic processes in photon - quark collision and their nlo qcd corrections , which are of the @xmath42 and @xmath41 , respectively , should be included .",
    "these partonic processes , called as the subprocesses with initial photon , are written as @xmath43 where the contributions from @xmath44 and @xmath45 are excluded due the @xmath11-tagging technique .    .",
