    "<S> this progress has deepened our understanding of various phenomena such as bcs - bec crossover of fermions @xcite and superfluid - mott insulator phase transition of bosons in an optical lattice @xcite . however , the variety of quantum phases that can be realized in cold atom systems is limited by the short - range nature of the interparticle interactions . </S>",
    "<S> recent progress in producing and manipulating heteronuclear polar molecules @xcite provides an opportunity to realize a plethora of novel quantum phases of matter governed by long - range interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this interesting prospect is made possible by the fact that polar molecules have large electric dipole moments associated with their rotational excitations , which lead to strong , long - range and anisotropic dipole - dipole interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the interactions between such polar molecules can be tuned using dc and ac electric fields  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below , we concentrate on one intriguing aspect of fermionic polar molecule systems - the possibility to realize bilayer superfluidity ( or equivalently bilayer @xmath0 ferromagnetism ) with spontaneous interlayer coherence using interlayer molecular repulsion .    because of the fermionic nature of the molecules even for the spinless fermion case considered here , the interaction has an exchange component in the layer ( or pseudospin ) index which drives the instability towards the bilayer superfluid phase . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant contribution to the exchange energy comes from the short distances ( large momenta ) where the interlayer dipolar interaction is repulsive . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the novel collective bilayer state we predict arises from a repulsive interaction in sharp contrast to all other superfluid quantum phases discussed in cold atomic fermions where inter - particle attraction leads to superfluidity . in the symmetry broken interlayer coherent phase , </S>",
    "<S> the particle number in each layer becomes indeterminate in spite of the interlayer single - particle tunneling amplitude being almost zero . </S>",
    "<S> such a state is very analogous to an excitonic superfluid in which excitons formed a quasiparticle in one layer `` binding '' to a quasihole in the other layer condense into a phase coherent state . up to this date </S>",
    "<S> the clearest evidence for the realization of this type of exciton superfluid state has been observed in semiconductor bilayers in the quantum hall ( qh ) regime , in which the layers are immersed in very high magnetic fields  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the unavoidable presence of disorder in solid state systems as well as the nature of the measurement involving finite interlayer tunneling  @xcite cause complications in the pristine realization of the interlayer superfluid phase in qh bilayers . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> vortices and the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition , unambiguous signatures of the interlayer coherent state , have not been observed yet in solid state qh systems . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted polar molecule bilayer superfluid phase should be more striking because of the lack of disorder in cold atom systems , the tunability of the interaction strength and the availability of experimental techniques allowing imaging of vortices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by adding an optical lattice potential in the @xmath1-plane it is possible to modify the single - particle dispersion of the particles and model various condensed matter systems . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the bilayer cold - polar - molecule system with honeycomb lattice potential will mimic the bilayer graphene system . </S>",
