    "the fundamental existence result @xcite of sacks - uhlenbeck asserts that there exists a set of free homotopy classes of maps from @xmath2 to a compact manifold @xmath3 so that the elements in these classes form a generating set for @xmath4 acted on by @xmath5 and each class contains a minimizing harmonic map @xmath6 .",
    "this can be used to show that there are only finitely many distinct free homotopy classes in @xmath4 which are representable by maps in @xmath7 with energies stay below a given positive constant @xcite . for homotopy classes",
    ", one needs to count contribution of @xmath5 by fixing a base point , and the set @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a positive constant and @xmath10 is the dirichlet energy of @xmath11 may contain infinitely many homotopy classes .",
    "an example describing such behavior is first constructed in @xcite and then modified in @xcite to the compact setting by mapping a portion of the domain surface to curves whose lengths go to infinity while the total energies remain uniformly bounded .    for harmonic maps ,",
    "if the domain is a single @xmath2 and the energies are uniformly bounded , it follows from parker s bubble tree convergence theorem @xcite that the limiting map ( of a subsequence ) is from a stratified sphere , i.e. a chain of 2-spheres obtained by pinching finitely many loops on @xmath2 to points ( see definition in section 2 ) , and consequently there are only finitely many homotopy classes for harmonic maps from @xmath2 under a fixed energy level .",
    "there are interesting geometric situations , e.g. harmonic map heat flow and mean curvature flow , where we need to consider a sequence of harmonic maps from stratified spheres , possibly different , and study the homotopy of these maps .",
    "in this paper we prove :    [ str ] let @xmath3 be a compact riemannian manifold without boundary . then for any @xmath12 , the set of harmonic maps from stratified 2-spheres to @xmath3 with energies @xmath13 contains only finitely many homotopy class .    to keep track of the homotopy classes when a sequence of harmonic maps from ( possibly different ) stratified spheres converge as a bubble tree , we reformulate the construction of bubble trees @xcite , @xcite and introduce _ a normalization _ of a stratified sphere ( see definition [ homo ] ) , which is , roughly , a surjective continuous map from @xmath2 to a stratified sphere @xmath14 and collapses finitely many multiply connected regions arising from the blowup points to the singular points of @xmath14 .",
    "this procedure allows us to use the homotopy class of a normalization to capture the homotopy of a map from a stratified sphere .",
    "+ there are interesting applications of theorem [ str ] to geometric flows . in this regard , it is useful to find manifolds which have infinitely many homotopy classes representable by mappings from @xmath2 with uniformly bounded energies . in theorem",

    "it is shown by qing - tian in @xcite that for the bubbling of a palais - smale sequence for the dirichlet energy functional with a uniform @xmath29-bound on the tension fields , there are no necks between bubbles in the limit .",
    "when the domain surface is @xmath2 , the limit is a harmonic map from a stratified 2-dimensional sphere .",
    "hence , absence of harmonic maps from any stratified spheres with energies less than a given bound @xmath9 in certain homotopy classes implies that the harmonic map flow starting from an initial map with energy below @xmath9 in such homotopy classes must develop finite time singularities , as pointed out already in introduction of @xcite . for the mean curvature flow ,",
