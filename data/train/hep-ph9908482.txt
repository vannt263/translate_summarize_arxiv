    "supersymmetry ( susy ) provides perhaps the best motivated extension of the standard model .",
    "spontaneous susy breaking leads naturally to radiative electroweak symmetry breaking with masses of order the electroweak scale for the superpartners of the standard model ( sm ) particles . if the messenger interactions which couple the sm superpartners to the susy breaking sector are stronger than gravity , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is the goldstone fermion of supersymmetry breaking , the goldstino @xmath8 .",
    "the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) is generally the lightest sm superpartner .",
    "if the intrinsic scale of supersymmetry breaking is below @xmath9 tev the nlsp can decay to its sm partner and the goldstino on laboratory length scales @xcite .",
    "this has an important impact on experimental susy signatures at high energy colliders . since superpartners are generally produced in pairs , these decays give rise to final states with two hard partons and missing energy ( @xmath10 ) carried by the goldstino pair , and with possibly other partons in the final state from cascade decays to the nlsp @xcite .",
    "the identity of the nlsp determines the type of final states which arise from decay to the goldstino @xcite .",
    "a neutralino nlsp , @xmath11 , which is gaugino - like , can decay by @xmath12 , leading to final states with @xmath13 .",
    "a slepton nlsp , @xmath14 , can decay by @xmath15 , giving @xmath16 final states . in this letter",
    "we consider in detail the possibility of a fermionic higgsino - like neutralino nlsp .",
    "because it is the superpartner of the higgs boson , @xmath0 , a higgsino nlsp can decay by @xmath17 .",
    "in addition , since the longitudinal component of the @xmath1 boson mixes with the goldstone mode of the higgs field , @xmath18 can also result . because of a strong phase space suppression of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 final states near threshold , decay to a photon can also be important for higgsinos not too much heavier than the @xmath1 boson .",
    "pair production of higgsinos which decay to goldstinos can then give rise to the di - boson final states @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "di - boson signatures which include higgs and @xmath1 bosons and @xmath10 are quite novel discovery modes for supersymmetry in the mass range accessible to the current generation of high energy collider experiments . in conventional susy signatures ,",
    "in which the lightest neutralino , @xmath11 , is assumed to escape the detector without decay to the goldstino , the mass splittings between supersymmetric particles required in order for @xmath0 or @xmath1 to arise in a cascade decay , typically imply the superpartners are too heavy to be produced in sufficient numbers at present colliders .",
    "for this reason events with reconstructed @xmath1 bosons are in fact generally rejected in present susy searches . however , since the goldstino is essentially massless , sufficient phase space is available for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 modes for a higgsino somewhat heavier than @xmath0 or @xmath1 . and this mass range will be accessible at the upcoming run ii at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "the higgs final states also present the exciting possibility of discovering and studying the higgs boson in association with supersymmetry .",
    "if supersymmetry is broken at a low scale , as required for the di - boson sigatures discussed here , it is very likely that the sm gauge interactions play some role in coupling the susy breaking sector to the sm superpartners @xcite .",
    "however , such gauge - mediated susy breaking requires additional interactions between the higgs and susy breaking sectors in order to break certain higgs sector global symmetries and obtain acceptable electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "these interactions can modify the higgsino mass from minimal expectations , and allow for a higgsino nlsp .",
    "so searches for di - boson signatures of a higgsino nlsp within theories of low scale gauge - mediated susy breaking are very well motivated as possible indirect probes for the existence of these additional couplings .",
    "the higgsinos @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fermionic superpartners of the higgs boson fields @xmath24 and @xmath25 . the neutral higgsinos mix with the gaugino superpartners of the @xmath2 and @xmath1 gauge bosons ,",
    "while the charged higgsino mixes with the gaugino superpartner of the @xmath26 gauge boson . in the limit relevant here , in which the gauginos are heavier than the higgsinos , the two lightest neutralinos and lightest chargino , @xmath11 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , are predominantly higgsino and approximately degenerate .",
    "the splitting between these states is on the order of 10 - 15 gev for masses in the range 120 - 250 gev discussed below .",
    "if the @xmath29 and @xmath30 gaugino mass parameters , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , have the same sign , @xmath33 then @xmath11 is the nlsp .",
    "for @xmath34 it is however possible in certain regions of parameter space that @xmath28 is the nlsp . in this letter only a @xmath11 nlsp , which leads to the interesting di - boson signatures , will be considered .",
    "the branching ratios @xmath35 are determined by the higgsino and gaugino content of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "= 3.5 in    this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ br ] as a function of the neutralino mixing angle @xmath36 for fixed @xmath11 mass , where @xmath37 is the higgsino mass parameter , and @xmath38 is the ratio of higgs expectation values . for definiteness",
    "the higgs decoupling limit in which decays to the heavy scalar and pseudoscalar higgs bosons , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , are kinematically blocked is employed throughout . for gaugino - like",
    "@xmath11 the @xmath2 mode dominates , but for higgsino - like @xmath11 the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes become important . the dependence on @xmath41 and @xmath42 apparent in fig .",
    "[ br ] can be understood in terms of the @xmath11 quantum numbers and couplings and will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the branching ratios also depend on the @xmath11 mass through the phase space available to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes which suffer a @xmath43 velocity suppression near threshold @xcite .",
    "so even a higgsino - like @xmath11 decays predominantly by @xmath44 for masses not too far above the @xmath0 and @xmath1 masses .",
