    "the statistical mechanics of interfaces between coexisting phases dates back to van der waals @xcite and gibbs @xcite .",
    "some results , like young s equation @xcite for the contact angle under which the vapor - liquid interface of a sessile ( macroscopic ) droplet meets the supporting wall in thermal equilibrium , are known since more than 200 years .",
    "understanding the statistical mechanics of interfacial phenomena is relevant for important problems such as nucleation @xcite , wetting and spreading of fluid films @xcite , metallurgy @xcite and crystal growth @xcite and diverse technological applications that these phenomena have ( ranging from oil recovery @xcite over the efficient deposition of pesticides on plant leaves @xcite and microfluidic devices @xcite to the prediction of rain clouds resulting from nucleation of ice crystals in the atmosphere @xcite , etc . ) .    in view of this long history and widespread applications and broad significance of this subject",
    "it is surprising that still many basic aspects are not yet well understood .",
    "e.g. , regarding interfacial profiles and widths it is still problematic to disentangle the `` intrinsic '' profile and width @xcite from the broadening @xcite caused by capillary waves @xcite .",
    "while experimental methods exist to measure the interfacial free energy of ( macroscopically flat ) fluid - fluid interfaces and liquid - vapor interfaces , the measurement of interfacial tensions involving a solid - phase is difficult @xcite : thus such quantities often are extracted from contact angle measurements @xcite assuming the validity of young s equation @xcite ( rather than checking it ) . since accurate contact angle measurements are severely hampered by contact angle hysteresis between advancing and receding three - phase contact lines @xcite it is difficult to obtain precise experimental information on either the effects of curvature on the interfacial free energy of a ( nanoscopically small ) droplet or on the excess free energy due to the three - phase contact line , the line tension @xcite . as reviewed by mugele et al .",
    "@xcite , early attempts to measure the line tensions yielded estimates that presumably are several orders of magnitude too large .",
    "and although the concept of a line tension was already introduced by gibbs @xcite and since then has been thoroughly studied ( see e.g. indekeu @xcite and dietrich et al .",
    "@xcite ) , there are still severe conceptual problems @xcite , and there is an ongoing debate @xcite on the physical significance of the line tension for describing the contact angle of nanodroplets @xcite .",
    "likewise , there has been a longstanding debate ( see schrader et al .",
    "@xcite and block et al .",
    "@xcite for references ) on the sign and magnitude of the `` tolman length '' @xmath0 @xcite introduced to describe the curvature dependent surface tension @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the radius of a spherical droplet @xmath3 while tolman @xcite originally suggested that @xmath0 is a positive constant and a length of molecular dimensions , it soon was recognized that eq .",

    "[ eq2 ] in fact also holds for asymmetric fluids , such as the ordinary lennard - jones model for a vapor to liquid transition . however , a suggestion that @xmath7 for all fluids is at odds with many density functional calculations ( see e.g. talanquer and oxtoby @xcite and granasy @xcite ) that actually @xmath8 is nonzero in general but strongly @xmath2-dependent ( and @xmath9 is slightly negative for a droplet surrounded by vapor ) . of course , density functional theory is not exact , e.g.  it ignores the effects due to capillary - wave fluctuations of the interfaces and the underlying assumptions of a mean - field character @xcite cause the fact that the radial density profile of a droplet has a singular behavior ( the radius of a metastable droplet diverges , although its free energy vanishes , when the state of the vapor reaches the spinodal density ) , which is spurious for systems with short range forces @xcite . in view of these problems",

    "this result @xcite agrees with recent simulation approaches applying rather different methods @xcite and is essentially equivalent to a relation @xmath11 proposed by the density functional theory @xcite .",
    "however , also for computer simulation approaches the accurate prediction of interfacial free energies has been a challenging problem .",
    "one difficulty is that one needs to study systems with rather large linear dimensions , to avoid ( or at least control ) finite size effects , that are due to the constraints that boundary conditions have on long range interfacial fluctuations , such as capillary waves at interfaces between fluid phases . even more difficult",
    "is the study of solid - liquid interfaces @xcite , since the periodic boundary conditions that are normally applied in the directions parallel to the interface may create a misfit resulting in an elastic distortion of the crystal structure of the solid , which would lead to severe systematic errors .",
    "even when the finite size effects @xcite are under control , one must consider that interfaces are mesoscopic `` objects '' and their fluctuations are rather slow , and hence a substantial effort of statistical sampling is required .",
    "thus , the present review can only be a progress report , and the selection of material is clearly biased by the expertise and interests of the authors .    in the next section ,",
    "we focus on the estimation of interface free energies from thermodynamic integration , using the energy excess of a system with interfaces relative to a system without interfaces as observable that is sampled .",
    "this approach is particularly popular and simple for lattice models such as the ising model @xcite , where standard relations for fluid systems ( e.g.  based on the anisotropy of the pressure tensor @xcite ) are not applicable . as an example",
    ", we shall discuss the estimation of @xmath12 , the interfacial free energy of a domain wall between oppositely oriented spins in the ising model , considering an inclination of the interface plane by an angle @xmath13 relative to a ( 100 ) lattice plane in the simple cubic model @xcite .",
    "the method can straightforwardly be extended to obtain the excess free energy of the ising models due to walls @xcite ( where `` surface fields '' @xcite may act ) . in this way",
    ", the difference in wall free energies of coexisting phases that enter the young @xcite equation , can be directly estimated @xcite , and this approach can be carried over to off - lattice models of fluids as well @xcite .",
    "we shall describe such applications in sec .",
    "then we turn ( sec .  4 ) to an alternative method , where one samples the distribution of the order parameter of a system under conditions where two phases can coexist in thermal equilibrium , traversing the coexistence region using umbrella sampling techniques @xcite or related methods @xcite . from such studies the interfacial free energy of flat interfaces of fluid systems can be studied conveniently even when it is very small , e.g.  in the region near the critical point @xcite . recently",
    "this method has been extended to study the free energy of spherical @xcite and cylindrical droplets ( and bubbles ) @xcite ) .",
    "also an extension to wall - attached droplets has been proposed , which allows to test @xcite concepts on heterogeneous nucleation @xcite and to provide estimates for the line tension ( sec .",
    "finally we give in sec .",
    "6 a brief comparison to other methods and an outlook on open problems .",

    "we note that for off - lattice systems the use of reference states for which the free energy is trivially known is clearly more subtle @xcite . a general disadvantage of eq .  [ eq5 ]",
    "is that for an accurate numerical integration the discretization of the temperature interval from @xmath27 to @xmath29 needs a very large number of intermediate states @xmath30 , e.g. , in the study of surface - induced ordering for the face - centered cubic ising antiferromagnet a number of a few hundred temperatures was used @xcite , in order to locate the first - order phase transition with a relative accuracy of about @xmath31 .",

    "note that in @xmath36 ( and y , in @xmath35 dimensions ) periodic boundary conditions are applied throughout , to ensure translational invariance in the directions parallel to the interface .",
    "the interfaces between coexisting domains at positive ( + ) and negative ( - ) magnetization are shown schematically as dash - dotted lines .",
    "note that the state ( c ) is stable if the total magnetization in the system is conserved ( and chosen zero or close to zero ) . ]    in order to extend this approach to obtain interfacial free energies , one needs to choose suitable boundary conditions , in order to prepare a system at phase coexistence , with one ( or two ) interfaces separating the coexisting phases \\{e.g .",

    "in fact , for square ( or simple cubic ) lattices and nearest neighbor exchange @xmath46 the fixed spin boundary condition corresponds simply to a specific choice of the surface field ( @xmath47 ) for the surface field boundary condition .",
    "no disturbance at the boundaries of the lattice is obtained for the antiperiodic boundary condition fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , of course .",
    "this choice is only possible for systems with a trivial symmetry between the coexisting phases , such as the spin - reversal symmetry of the ising ferromagnet , or the @xmath48 exchange symmetry of a symmetric binary mixture ( a , b ) .",

    "the simulation results for both the ising model and the symmetrical binary lennard - jones mixture in fact are compatible with this assumption ( figs .",
    "[ fig18 ] , [ fig19 ] ) .",
    "the resulting estimates @xmath487 for both models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig20 ] .",
    "note that in the ising case ( with @xmath166 ) one has a second order wetting transition , and hence one expects @xmath515 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the lj mixture exhibits a first order wetting transition ( see sec .",
    "3 ) , and in this case one expects @xmath516 .",
    "however , since @xmath115 is negative for large @xmath107 , it is implied that @xmath115 must change sign before the wetting transition is reached @xcite . indeed the numerical data ( fig .",
    "20b ) are compatible with this expectation .",
    "in the present article , we have reviewed a selection of methods which have been used to simulate phase coexistence between fluid phases , for simple models of statistical mechanics , and we have discussed the information on interfacial free energies and related properties ( contact angles at walls , line tension ) that one can extract from these studies . neither the detailed interfacial structure nor the study of wetting transitions has been discussed . however , even with this restricted scope we have by no means attempted to present an exhaustive coverage of the subject , but rather we have described the techniques using a few examples , taken from the research groups of the authors for the sake of simplicity .",
    "it needs to be stated , that very valuable research on related topics can be found in the literature from other groups , sometimes also for other models than the models ( lattice gas , lennard - jones fluid , symmetric binary lj mixture ) that were discussed here .",
    "e.g. , a particularly well - studied model system is the square - well fluid .",
    "van swol and henderson @xcite have investigated wetting and drying at fluid - wall interfaces for this model , and compared their simulations to density functional calculations .",
    "due to the lack of any particularly symmetries for this model ( or the lennard - jones fluid considered in the pioneering study by sikkenk et al .",
    "@xcite ) , it was difficult to obtain very accurate results on interfacial free energies , contact angles etc . at this time , considering also the fact that now orders of magnitude more computer power can be invested than available for this early work @xcite .",
    "significant progress has also been made via a better understanding of the statistical mechanics of the fluid - wall interactions @xcite , and this work is also basic for a very interesting recent simulation study @xcite where a slab geometry of a liquid bridge between two walls with contact angles @xmath517 such that @xmath518 has been analyzed . in this work",
    ", it became possible to derive estimates for the line tension @xmath487 for several values of the contact angle @xmath107 .",
    "we also add that we have only addressed the problem of phase equilibria of two fluid phases in the presence of a solid flat wall .",
    "we have neither considered other geometries ( e.g. wedge geometries , where `` filling transitions '' can occur @xcite ) nor have we considered interfacial phenomena where the solid wall is replaced by another fluid phase ; in this case three fluid - fluid interfaces also can meet at a contact line , but the corresponding line tension @xcite was out of consideration here .",
    "also the problem of contact angles and wall - attached droplets for non - volatile fluids was out of our scope .",
    "e.g. , a typical example is a droplet formed by a polymer melt at a substrate @xcite : the vapor surrounding the polymer droplet typically does not contain any polymers at all , so strictly speaking the system is not in full equilibrium ( which would imply that the polymers completely evaporate ) , but in practice this does not occur at all at the time scales of interest .",
    "some of the methods described here could be carried over to a study of such more complex systems as well .",
    ": this research was supported in part by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( grants n@xmath519 sfb tr6/a5 and spp 1296-bi 314/19 ) .",
    "we are greatly indebted to martin oettel for fruitful discussions",
