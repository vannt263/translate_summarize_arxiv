    "a normal metal ( n ) in good electrical contact with a superconductor ( s ) exhibits superconducting properties as the temperature is reduced .",

    "recently , it has received a revived interest@xcite .",
    "particularly , experiments on the magnetic response have demonstrated nontrivial screening properties , showing hysteretic magnetic breakdown at finite external fields@xcite as well as a presently unexplained reentrant effect at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "first theoretical studies on the proximity effect were carried out by cooper@xcite . for a diffusive proximity system",
    "the diamagnetic susceptibility in the linear regime was investigated by the orsay group on superconductivity in the framework of the ginzburg ",
    "landau theory@xcite . in this limit",
    "it was found that the induced diamagnetic susceptibility in n depends on temperature approximately as @xmath5 .",
    "this was confirmed experimentally by oda and nagano@xcite . in spite of that , the magnetic properties of proximity samples discussed in refs . and could not be explained by the ginzburg  landau theory , since they show a much stronger temperature dependence of the diamagnetic susceptibility .    the clean limit , which is defined for the elastic mean free path @xmath6 , was first studied by zaikin@xcite for a finite system of ideal geometry with the help of the quasiclassical theory .",
    "he predicted that , since in this case the current  field relation is completely nonlocal , the current in n is spatially constant and depends on the vector potential integrated over the whole normal metal .",
    "as a consequence , the magnetic flux is screened linearly over the normal layer thickness @xmath2 and for @xmath7 the susceptibility can reach only @xmath8 of that of a perfect diamagnet .",
    "for @xmath9 he found @xmath10 , with the andreev temperature @xmath11 .",
    "this mesoscopic temperature scale originates from the energy of the lowest andreev bound state@xcite . in this ballistic case all properties of the proximity effect are determined by these bound states , which are coherent superpositions of electron and hole waves between consecutive andreev and normal reflections .    within the framework of the quasiclassical theory , belzig  _ _ et",
    "al.__@xcite studied recently the magnetic response of a proximity coupled ns sandwich in the two limits , clean and dirty .",
    "they obtained numerical solutions of the corresponding equations for a wide range of temperature , magnetic field and layer thickness .",
    "furthermore , they tried a fit of the susceptibility data of one agnb specimen with a relatively small mean free path ( specimen 1agnb in this paper ) within their dirty limit results .",
    "the fit was only successful at very low temperatures , but could not reproduce the high temperature data .",
    "the diamagnetic screening of the dirty limit was too big as compared to the experiment .",
    "moreover , the temperature dependence of the susceptibility of ns proximity specimens with the longest mean free paths could not be explained within the clean limit theory .",
    "this limit gives a completely different temperature dependence than the one observed in the experiments .",
    "in addition , data at low temperatures reach almost perfect diamagnetic screening , whereas in the clean limit it should not exceed @xmath12 of full screening . to close the gap between these two limits the linear magnetic response for arbitrary impurity concentrations",

    "a proximity ns sandwich with a finite normal layer thickness @xmath2 at sufficiently low temperatures undergoes a first order phase transition both in the clean and in the dirty limit . at a breakdown field",
    "a jump in the magnetization occurs . in the clean limit",
    "the temperature dependence of the breakdown field is @xmath13 .",
    "we show in this paper , that the clean limit result agrees well with our experiments on @xmath14 ( see also ref . ) , which follow the same temperature dependence in relatively clean specimens ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "also the experimentally found absolute values of the breakdown fields show a @xmath16dependence , which is in qualitative agreement with the clean limit theory@xcite . however , this is not the case for the shape of the magnetization curves and , as mentioned before , for the temperature dependence of the linear susceptibility .",
    "we have fabricated a new set of cunb and agnb specimens similar to the ones reported in ref .. the specimens were produced with an optimized annealing procedure in order to achieve very high mean free paths .",
    "the ratio of the thickness of the normal layer to the radius of the superconductor of the composite wires , @xmath17 , was also varied to investigate comparable samples with normal layers reaching from almost flat to rather curved cylindrical geometry .",
    "thus the influence of the ns geometry on the proximity effect was investigated . in this paper ,",
    "we discuss these new samples together with older ones@xcite , covering a wide range of parameters , and fit their diamagnetic response with the help of the quasiclassical theory in an intermediate impurity regime between the clean and dirty limit . here",
    ", we will not consider the reentrant effect found by mota and co  workers@xcite but only note that a recent theoretical study has addressed this new phenomenon@xcite .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we describe some theoretical aspects of the magnetic response . in sec .",

    "finally we draw some conclusions .",
    "within the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity@xcite the magnetic response of a planar ns  proximity structure was investigated for arbitrary impurity concentrations by belzig  _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "below we summarize some basic results of this paper .",
    "the theoretical system consists of a semi  infinite superconductor in perfect contact with a normal metal of thickness @xmath2 and specular reflecting outer surface .",
    "the pair potential @xmath18 is taken to be constant in the superconductor and to be zero in the normal metal .",
    "the mean free path @xmath0 and the fermi velocity @xmath19 are assumed to be the same throughout the system .    in ref .",
    "a variety of regimes are discussed , where the proximity effect is different from the previously studied clean and dirty limits .",
    "the regimes differ by the relative magnitudes of the thermal length @xmath20 , the mean free path @xmath0 , and the thickness @xmath2 , an additional relevant length scale , which has to be taken into account . in the case of a finite normal layer thickness @xmath2 , the clean and the dirty limit are restricted to much smaller parameter regions than previously believed .",
    "the dirty limit holds for @xmath21 only , if also the mean free path @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the coherence length in the superconductor . on the other hand",
    ", the regime @xmath24 belongs to the ballistic regime , if @xmath25 .    to treat the screening problem , a general linear ",
    "response formula was derived which yields a non  local current  field relation in terms of the zero  field green s functions .",
    "these functions are obtained from the solution of the eilenberger equation including an impurity selfenergy . in general this",
    "has to be done numerically , since analytical expressions can be derived only in the clean and in the dirty limit .",
    "finally , the maxwell equations have to be solved .",
    "the chosen geometry is such that the ns interface lies in the @xmath26@xmath27 plane .",
    "then the current in the normal metal has the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the vector potential in transverse gauge , if the magnetic field is applied in @xmath27direction .",
    "the kernel @xmath30 contains an exponential dependence on the distance @xmath31 .",
    "the range of the kernel is given by @xmath0 in most of the temperature and impurity regimes .",
    "for @xmath32 and @xmath33 that is , at high temperatures , it is given by @xmath34 .",
    "it has thus a strong temperature dependence which has to be contrasted to the case of a bulk superconductor , where the range of the pippard kernel is only weakly temperature dependent .",
    "the prefactor of the exponential in the kernel , which in general depends on coordinates , is related to the local superfluid density .",
    "it introduces an additional length scale in the problem , the field penetration depth @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a london like length in the normal metal and @xmath37 is a function of temperature and position . the interplay between the range of the kernel and the superfluid density determines whether the nonlocal form of the current field relation is important .",
    "this has strong consequences on the screening properties , especially in the case @xmath38 , which is discussed in detail in ref ..     and different impurity regimes as functions of @xmath39 .",
    "the clean limit is given by a solid line and an usadel theory result for @xmath40 is given by a dash - dotted line .",
    "for the intermediate impurity regime three cases are given : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath40 . ]",
    "[ figure5 ]    in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] we reproduce some numerical results@xcite of the screening fraction @xmath43 in a normal metal layer for @xmath44 .",
    "five curves as a function of temperature , normalized to the andreev temperature , are given for different mean free paths @xmath0 .",
    "for the clean limit , @xmath45 , at zero temperature , the screening can only reach @xmath8 of @xmath46 .",
    "this is due to the infinite range of the kernel , or in other words , the complete non  locality of the current  field relation . at a temperature @xmath47",
    ", the screening is exponentially reduced by thermal occupation of the andreev levels@xcite , and at higher temperatures screening is almost negligible .    for @xmath41 and @xmath42 screening",
    "is enhanced in comparison to the clean limit at low and high temperatures . at low temperatures screening",
    "is more effective for @xmath48 , since the range of the kernel is given by finite @xmath0 . at high temperatures , where the range of the kernel is @xmath49 ,",
    "screening is more effective than in the clean limit but still nonlocal . for @xmath40 , already at @xmath50 screening is considerably reduced , since the superfluid density is suppressed because the mean free path is smaller than @xmath2 .    in the diffusive regime",
    ", it can be shown that for @xmath51 , the nonlocal relation is reduced to the local current  field relation of the usadel theory@xcite .",
    "in particular , for the case @xmath52 corresponding approximately to the experiments discussed in this paper , the condition @xmath53 has to be met .",
    "indeed , in fig .  [ figure5 ]",
    "we illustrate the non ",
    "negligible difference in screening even for the case @xmath40 , between the local usadel result and the nonlocal approach with elastic scattering described in ref .. for @xmath54 the usadel result exhibits less screening , whereas for @xmath55 it shows a much more pronounced screening tail .",
    "after these recent results , covering a wide range between the clean and the dirty limits , we have now the possibility to analyze the magnetic response of our relatively clean ns proximity specimens . to compare the experiments with the theory we have used the full form ( [ jy ] ) valid for all impurity concentrations and solved the screening problem for each specimen numerically .",
    "in these theoretical considerations the effect of a rough normal metal  vacuum boundary has been neglected completely . on the other hand , at high enough temperatures @xmath9 , where the induced diamagnetism strongly decreases , the influence of surface scattering does not play an important role , since in this temperature regime the superfluid density at the outer boundary is exponentially suppressed .",
    "the screening in this regime can be only due to bulk scattering centers and is insensitive to the quality of the surface .",
    "the quasiclassical theory for the nonlinear response in the clean limit was discussed in detail by fauchre  _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "they derived analytical expressions for the temperature dependent breakdown field @xmath56 of a clean normal ",
    "metal slab of finite thickness in proximity with a bulk superconductor in the two limits @xmath7 and @xmath57 .",
    "the breakdown field @xmath14 was determined with a maxwell construction from the magnetization at the bistable regime , where two different values of the free energy coexist , characterizing a diamagnetic and a field penetration phase .",
    "the spinodals of that bistable regime have already been determined in the clean and in the dirty limit by belzig  _ _ et al.__@xcite numerically .",
    "they represent the boundaries of superheating and supercooling in the first order phase transition .",
    "the thermodynamical magnetic breakdown field lies in between the spinodals .",
    "it was determined by the intersection of the two asymptotics of the free energy .    for @xmath7",
    "the breakdown field saturates at@xcite @xmath58 whereas for @xmath9 it decays as@xcite @xmath59 the temperature dependence is a simple exponential with the exponent @xmath60 .",
    "the amplitude of the breakdown field was found to scale inversely proportional to the normal layer thickness .",
    "both features are in agreement with previous experimental results on @xmath14 in relatively clean agnb specimens@xcite .    in the @xmath61@xmath62 phase",
    "diagram a critical temperature @xmath63 was found , below which the first order phase transition is observable . above @xmath63",
    "a continuous and reversible crossover between the diamagnetic and field penetration regime occurs .",
    "since the breakdown field depends only on thermodynamical considerations , it is expected to be less sensitive to the nonlocality of the current  field relation than the linear susceptibility .",
    "a cylindrical geometry and a barrier at the ns interface is expected to change the breakdown field only quantitatively@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the influence of scattering centers is reflected in the shape of the magnetization curves@xcite . at present , no theoretical results for the breakdown field or magnetization curves exist for intermediate impurity concentrations .",
    "the samples we investigated are bundles of cylindrical wires with a superconducting core of niobium or tantalum concentrically embedded in a normal metal matrix of copper or silver .",
    "the normal metal starting materials are of purity 4n to 6n with negligible contribution of magnetic impurities .",
    "the purity of the niobium and tantalum starting materials was the highest accessible ( @xmath64 ) , resulting in a good ductibility .",
    "we assembled the samples by placing in a close fit , a rod of the s material inside a hollow cylinder of the n material , with typical outer diameter of about 20 mm .",
    "the cleanliness of the internal n tube surface and the s rod surface is very important .",
    "the surfaces of the initial metal pieces were cleaned in acid and mechanically smoothed with a special tool in order to provide a good metallic contact .",
    "all this was done in an argon atmosphere .",
    "the ns cylinder was then embedded in a cu mantle to protect the sample itself from contamination .",
    "after assembly , the diameter was reduced mechanically by several steps of swagging and co ",
    "drawing@xcite down to a total diameter of several hundred microns .    after etching away the cu protection ,",
    "the diameter of the ns specimens was further reduced by co  drawing the wires through several diamond dies to final values between @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the extreme size reduction ( by factors of up to 1000 ) by co  drawing resulted in a great enhancement of the quality of the ns interface for electronic transmission .",
    "the use of high purity starting materials guaranteed a high electronic mean free path .",
    "some of the samples were annealed after the last drawing in an atmosphere of argon at a temperature around @xmath67 for about one hour to remove the effect of cold working in the normal metal . for that purpose",
    "the wire of selected size was wound on a small ag plate . as a consequence of the optimized annealing procedure",
    ", values of @xmath68 could be achieved .",
    "the mean free paths were obtained from resistivity measurements along the wires , performed at a temperature @xmath69 with a four  point method .",
    "the thickness of the normal metal layer as well as the surface quality of the wires were determined with the help of sem micrographs .",
    "several samples were prepared in order to cover a large range of parameter space .",
    "we fabricated agnb samples with a ratio @xmath17 of @xmath70 or @xmath71 .",
    "the layer thicknesses ranged from @xmath72 to @xmath73 with measured mean free paths ranging from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .",

    "the wires were glued with ge 7031 varnish and thus electrically insulated . after drying ,",
    "they were removed from the silver support , cut to a length of typically 3 mm to 5 mm and rolled together forming a bundle of 200 to 800 wires .",
    "the wire bundle was then placed directly inside the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator in contact with the liquid @xmath76-@xmath77 solution , mounted parallel to the coil axis of the magnetic ac and dc field .",
