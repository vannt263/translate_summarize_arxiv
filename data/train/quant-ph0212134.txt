    "<S> coupling of any element of a quantum computer to an environment destroys its unitary evolution , and introduces uncontrollable noise ; at first , it was thought by many @xcite that these errors would make quantum computation impossible in practice . since then , a variety of techniques for correcting errors and/or building in immunity to certain classes of decoherence have been developed @xcite and it has been proved that if errors are kept below a certain constant threshold , arbitrarily large quantum computers are possible@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one important technique involves computing within certain subspaces of the full system s hilbert space known as decoherence - free subspaces ( dfss ) @xcite which remain unaffected by the interaction with the environment . </S>",

    "<S> linear optics is well known to be an extremely powerful arena for the transportation and manipulation of quantum information , benbrassard , reckzeilinger . </S>",
    "<S> although it is also well known that due to the linearity of optics , this arena does not allow for scalable construction of quantum gates @xcite , recent work has shown that the incorporation of detection and post - selection may in fact render all - optical quantum computers an attractive possibility @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> work also proceeds on development of nonlinearities which would allow for the development of natural two - qubit gates in optics@xcite . while we do not yet have access to a truly scalable optical quantum - computer architecture </S>",
    "<S> , many of the elements of any such system would be identical to those used in simple linear - optical geometries @xcite . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> , linear optics remains an important domain for the study of quantum coherence and error correction , even while the ultimate fate of optical quantum computing is uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> recently , striking demonstrations of quantum search algorithms @xcite have been carried out in linear - optical systems , as has the first verification of dfss @xcite . additionally , it is already clear that even if quantum computation never becomes truly practical , quantum information processing may have a great effect on the practice of communications and cryptography@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although some information - processing will be necessary in this area as well , the question of scalability is not crucial , and linear - optical quantum computation could well prove applicable for elements such as quantum repeaters repeatersbriegel . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , we have chosen to study the applicability of dfss to a linear - optical implementation of the quantum deutsch - jozsa algorithm , despite the non - scalable nature of the present architecture .    </S>",
    "<S> the deutsch - jozsa algorithm is designed to distinguish between two classes of functions ( `` oracles '' )  on n - bit binary inputs . </S>",
    "<S> `` constant ''  functions return the same value ( 0 or 1 ) for all @xmath0 possible inputs , while `` balanced ''  functions return 0 for half the possible inputs and 1 for the other half .  </S>",
    "<S> clearly , a classical algorithm would on some occasions require as many as @xmath1 queries to unambiguously determine to which class a given oracle belongs .  </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , deutsch and jozsa showed @xcite that a quantum algorithm requires only one such query .  in the 2-qubit deutsch - jozsa algorithm @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the oracle is a function on a single bit .  </S>",
    "<S> it takes as input a query bit @xmath2 and a signal bit @xmath3 ; its action is to perform the unitary mapping @xmath4 _  _ @xmath5 _  _ @xmath6 to perform the algorithm , the input is prepared in @xmath7\\otimes \\lbrack \\left| 0\\right\\rangle -\\left| 1\\right\\rangle ] $ ] which the oracle maps to @xmath8=\\frac{1}{2}[\\left| 0\\right\\rangle e^{i\\pi </S>",
    "<S> f(0)}+\\left| 1\\right\\rangle e^{i\\pi f(1)}]\\otimes h\\left| 1\\right\\rangle $ ] .  </S>",
    "<S> a hadamard on the query qubit then transforms it into @xmath9 which is equal to 0 for constant and 1 for balanced functions . </S>",
    "<S> thus measurement in the computational basis allows one to determine a global property of @xmath10 , namely @xmath11 in a single evaluation of the function . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the signal qubit is in fact superfluous after the oracle @xcite .  </S>",
    "<S> thus only one logical qubit is needed after the operation of the oracle .  </S>",
    "<S> if some source of decoherence is present during the propagation from the oracle to the final hadamard , one may consider encoding this logical qubit in some decoherence - free subspace of the two physical qubits .    in this experiment </S>",
    "<S> we represent the four basis states of two logical qubits ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the first bit corresponds to the query and the second to the signal ) by a photon traveling down one of four optical rails numbered 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to implement a universal set of one- and two - qubit operations in a four - rail representation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example a not gate on the query qubit can be realized by simultaneously swapping rails 1 and 3 and rails 2 and 4 . a cnot gate on the signal qubit is implemented by swapping rails 3 and 4 .  </S>",
    "<S> to perform a hadamard gate on the query qubit , we combine rails 1 and 3 and rails 2 and 4 at two 50/50 beam - splitters ; a @xmath14 phase shift is also needed on two of the arms.analogous gates can be constructed for the other qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the transformations introduced by the four possible functions can also be implemented in this representation by four different settings of an oracle operating as follows : if @xmath15 is 1 , rails 1 and 2 are swapped ; if @xmath16 is 1 , rails 3 and 4 are swapped .  </S>",
    "<S> thus the task of distinguishing balanced from constant oracles reduces to that of determining whether the number of swaps was odd or even .    the schematic diagram of the interferometer is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> each photon is sent along rail 2 corresponding to the logical state @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the two pairs of 50/50 beam splitters @xmath18 , @xmath19and @xmath20 , @xmath21 implement the two hadamard gates on the query and signal qubits respectively , preparing the qubits for the oracle s action . </S>",
    "<S> the last two 50/50 beam splitters @xmath22 and @xmath23 realize the hadamard gate on the query qubit after the oracle . </S>",
    "<S> rails 1 - 4 illuminate photodiodes @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> a photon reaching pd1 or pd2 indicates that the value of the query qubit after the algorithm , @xmath25 , is 0 .  </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes a determination that the oracle is constant , while the other two detectors indicate balanced oracles .    </S>",
    "<S> one source of decoherence in such systems is the phase noise introduced by fluctuating optical path lengths between the different sections of the apparatus , created either by variations in distance or by temperature variations and turbulent air flow . in real optical systems , </S>",
    "<S> the stability of certain path - length differences may be larger than that of others , either because of the physical proximity of certain paths to one another or because of the particular sources of mechanical or thermal noise . </S>",
    "<S> this may lead to a situation where the dominant source of decoherence exhibits a particular symmetry which can be exploited for computing within dfss . to simulate the effects </S>",
    "<S> such processes could have in larger - scale , distributed quantum - information systems , we introduced a high degree of turbulence by placing the tip of a hot soldering iron below two of the optical rails . </S>",
    "<S> these two optical paths ( rails 2 and 3 ) were spatially superposed in this region , distinguished only by their polarisation ; for this reason , they experienced essentially the same random phase shifts under the influence of the turbulent air flow , relative to the other optical rails . </S>",
    "<S> since the outputs of the optical deutsch - jozsa setup are the outputs of two parallel interferometers , which measure the phase of rail 2 with respect to that of rail 4 and rail 3 with respect to rail 1 , this phase noise destroys the interference on which the success of the algorithm relies . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , inspection of the optical schematic makes the physical process behind the algorithm evident : rails 1 and 3 are prepared in phase with one another , while rails 2 and 4 are also prepared in phase , but @xmath26out of phase with the former pair . </S>",
    "<S> thus , constructive interference is observed either between 1 and 3 or between 2 and 4 . if a single pair ( 1 and 2 or 3 and 4 ) is swapped by the oracle , destructive interference is instead observed at both interferometers , while if an even number of swaps occurs , constructive interference is restored . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , so long as each interferometer compares an output of each of the potential swap regions in the oracle with one from the other , it is possible to distinguish a balanced oracle ( one swap ) from a constant oracle ( zero or two swaps ) . the strategy to deal with phase noise impressed symmetrically on paths 2 and 3 now becomes clear : instead of interfering 2 with 4 and 1 with 3 , one can accomplish the same task by interfering 2 with 3 and 1 with 4 . in this way , the random phase appears at both inputs to the same interferometer , and has no effect on the measured results .    </S>",
    "<S> this modification can be expressed as an encoding of the data into a pair of dfss . </S>",
    "<S> since our engineered phase noise has identical effects on the two states of odd parity ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 stored on rails 2 and 3 respectively ) and on the two states of even parity ( @xmath29 and @xmath13 , stored on rails 1 and 4 ) , each fixed - parity subspace can store a single logical qubit in a decoherence - free fashion . </S>",
    "<S> the action of the soldering iron tip may be modelled by the evolution operator @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is a random , fluctuating phase . in a subspace with a definite eigenvalue of @xmath32 , the random phase </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath33 does nothing but impress an overall global phase on the quantum state , leaving the information within the subspace unaffected . since the 2-qubit deutsch - jozsa algorithm relies on a single qubit ( query qubit ) after the oracle has completed its action , this single qubit may be encoded in either of these dfss , providing immunity to parity - dependent phase noise which occurs between the oracle and the final hadamard gates .  as shown in fig </S>",
    "<S> 1c , a cnot after the oracle encodes the query qubit into these dfss , and a second cnot after the final hadamard can be used for decoding .  </S>",
    "<S> the decoding cnot is unnecessary since measurements are only performed on the query qubit .  swapping rails 3 and 4 performs the encoding ; or equivalently , </S>",
    "<S> beam - splitters @xmath22 and @xmath23 may be replaced by @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> the actual experimental setup is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the light source was a diode laser operating at 780 nm . to implement the four different oracle settings a specific kind of variable beam splitter ( vbs ) </S>",
    "<S> was designed . </S>",
    "<S> this variable beam splitter consists of a half - waveplate between two polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) ; any desired reflectivity can be obtained with this optical arrangement . for realizing our oracles , a pair of these vbss was used , and </S>",
    "<S> each was adjusted either for maximum or minimum reflectivity , essentially acting as a swap or the identity .  </S>",
    "<S> hadamards were constructed using similar vbss . </S>",
    "<S> after the oracle rails 2 and 3 were combined into the same spatial mode in a pbs to guarantee the collective phase shift for these beams in presence of decoherence , and then separated out by another pbs . </S>",
    "<S> the transformation between two different encodings was performed by applying another vbs to either swap rails 3 and 4 or not . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup was designed such that in all of these interferometers the spatial path lengths are always balanced . </S>",
    "<S> the average fringe visibility for all four output ports and all possible settings of oracle and encoding was measured to be about 95% . </S>",
    "<S> this setup consists of 16 different possible mach - zehnder interferometers , of which two are in operation for any given oracle / encoding combination .     </S>",
    "<S> the experiment was performed by measuring the signals at detectors @xmath36 through @xmath37 as the half waveplates were adjusted to cycle through all four oracles and both encodings . </S>",
    "<S> the intensities at detectors pd1 through pd4 were normalized to their sum , to yield the probabilities of a photon reaching each of the detectors .  </S>",
    "<S> these normalized intensities are plotted in fig . 3 for all 4 oracle settings , in both the standard algorithm and the dfs encoding .  </S>",
    "<S> ideally , all the photons should arrive at detectors @xmath36 and @xmath38 for constant functions and at detectors @xmath39 and @xmath37 for balanced functions .  in figure 4 , we plot the probability of a photon reaching _  either _ pd1 or pd2 , and the probability of a photon reaching _ either _ pd3 or pd4 .  </S>",
    "<S> the average error rates were measured to be about 8% in the absence of added noise . </S>",
    "<S> the sources of errors in this experiment were mostly due to imperfect visibility , ( due to alignment and waveplate setting ) , and uncertainty and drift in the optical phases setting , when a @xmath40 phase error on one beam correspond to a 2% error rate . </S>",
    "<S> the drift of the interferometer during measurement was kept low by balancing all path lengths as mentioned above and enclosing the interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> introduction of the turbulent airflow increased the average error rates to 35% for the standard algorithm . when the dfs encoding was used in the presence of turbulence , however , the error rates dropped to 7% , essentially equal to the value in the absence of noise .    </S>",
    "<S> this work demonstrates that a simple modification of a quantum algorithm may be used to encode information into dfss , and significantly reduce the error rate introduced by realistic , physical noise sources , provided that these sources have certain symmetry properties . </S>",
    "<S> phase noise is an everpresent issue in coherent optical systems , and often exhibits certain correlations which should be exploitable in this manner . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that since the noise characteristics are intimately tied to the particular physical realization of a quantum circuit , it may often prove easier to design the decoherence - free process by direct consideration of the multiple interferometers which constitute the optical device , than by contemplation of the very general quantum circuits .    </S>",
    "<S> this work was supported by the us air force office of scientific research ( f49620 - 01 - 1 - 0468 ) , nserc , and photonics research ontario . </S>",
