    "magnetic activity drives high - energy processes in the atmospheres of stars .",
    "powerful releases of energy ( flares ) are regularly observed and display plasma temperatures of several 10@xmath3 k , reaching up to @xmath4 k in extreme cases ( see e.g. , gdel et al . , 1999 ; maggio et al . , 2000 ; favata et al . , 2000 ;",
    "franciosini et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "such processes give rise to observable effects in the microwave region , and while the high - energy tail of thermal electrons has been observed in hard x - rays ( pallavicini & tagliaferri , 1999 ; favata & schmitt , 1999 ; franciosini et al .",
    ", 2001 ) , evidence on the high - energy non - thermal electron population has generally been scant .",
    "one of the important facts to emerge from soft x - ray ( sxr ) observations during the skylab era was the recognition that magnetic loops constitute the basic ` building blocks ' of coronal structure ( rosner et al . , 1978 ) . using the solar analogy ,",
    "it became clear by 1980 that loops play a basic role in coronal energetics in both active and quiescent phases ( e.g. pallavicini et al .",
    ", 1977 , kane et al . , 1980 ) . regarding flares , according to the evaporation model ( cf .",
    "antonucci et al . , 1984 )",
    ", beams of fast electrons travel along loops and deposit their energy towards the lower chromospheric material .",
    "heated plasma may subsequently expand into the loop structures .",
    "this hot plasma cools through conduction and radiation , but more than one emission or absorption mechanism is likely to be involved ( dulk et al . , 1986 , bastian & gary , 1992 , alissandrakis et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "in the cm range , however , the dominant emission usually involves the gyrosynchrotron process from loops .",
    "the solar model is often used in trying to understand the mechanism and location of flares in active stars .",
    "a non - thermal electron population is thought to be present in the impulsive phase of flares ( doschek , 1972 ) and this is relevant to the power - law index of the electron energy distribution and its lower energy bound ( phillips & neupert , 1973 ) , used in microwave data analysis .",
    "hard x - rays ( @xmath510  kev ) should be emitted during the initial stages of the flare .",
    "softer x - rays become detected as high energy electrons impinge on denser ( ` chromospheric ' ) layers as the flare develops , giving rise to thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "complementary microwave observations should evidence the non - thermal electron source , giving information on its energy spectrum and possible changes during the course of a flare .",
    "in fact , radio data have sometimes pointed to a very strong non - thermal electron component ( e.g. , lim et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "the present study concentrates much of its in - depth analysis on such microwave data from the active star ab doradus in an effort to gain clearer insights into how such large energy releases occur . within the two days of combined x - ray and radio data we discuss , the latter showed higher signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio for typical integration intervals of several minutes , particularly in the higher frequency bands .",
    "the multi - wavelength campaign that stimulated the present work was originally aimed at examining , in particular , the initial population of highly accelerated ( non - thermal ) electrons . while very hard , non - thermal x - rays would be too weak to detect in quiescence , they were calculated to be picked up by suzaku s sensitive detectors during the onset of large flares .",
    "simultaneous radio and x - ray observations then have the possibility to reveal the ` neupert effect ' in flares .",
    "this concerns the correlation between radio and soft x - ray or uv flare emissions ( neupert , 1968 ) , in which the short wavelength light curve of radiatively cooling plasma tends to follow the integral of the radio emission .",
    "this can be interpreted in terms of ` loss cone ' gyrosynchrotron - emitting electrons encountering denser chromospheric layers , whereupon x - ray emission follows the radio decline with a short time lag .",
    "the neupert effect has been observed in several stars using radio and optical u - band data ( hawley et al . , 1996 ; gdel et al . , 1996 ; 2002a , b ) , and also radio and x - ray data ( osten et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "this multiwavelength surveillance has allowed checking of rotational modulation effects .",
    "in particular , ab dor is associated with long - lived centres of surface activity , noticed by persistent broadband ( optical ) maculation .",
    "the relationship of electron energization to such activity centres can be explored . in this way ,",
    "optical photometry and high - resolution spectroscopy , observed over intervals around the time of the x - ray and radio observations , supplement the overall picture of this intriguing star .",
    "ab  dor ( hd  36705 , k1v - type , @xmath1 = 6.93 mag , @xmath6 = 0.76 @xmath7 ) is a well - studied magnetically active young star that has been observed over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "the main target is the primary component of a small multiple system containing at least 4 stars .",
    "historically , ab dor a was regarded as the primary of the visual binary rst 137 ( separation around 7.5 arcsec ) .",
    "more recently both ab dor a and b were shown to be both binaries , involving low - mass companions ( see e.g.  janson et al .",
    ", 2007 , for a review giving modern parametrization ) .    the k - type main star , at 14.9  pc distance ( perryman et al . , 1997 )",
    ", displays numerous strong flares on time scales from minutes to weeks , with two extreme cases having integrated x - ray fluxes of @xmath84@xmath910@xmath10erg @xmath11 s@xmath12 , i.e.  about 60 times the quiescent level . observed flaring occurs at a mean rate of about one per day .",
    "peak temperatures of around 110@xmath910@xmath13  k ( figure  1 in maggio et al . , 2000 ) were inferred .",
    "this main star , ab  dor aa , has the relatively fast mean rotation of 1.40@xmath910@xmath14 radians  sec@xmath12 ( @xmath812.3  h period ) and was long associated with surface ` spots ' that allow not only the mean rotation , but also differential rotation and cyclic behaviour to be examined ( jrvinen et al . , 2005 ) .    the conclusion of rucinski ( 1983 ) and innis et al .",
    "( 1986 ) that ab dor aa ( subsequently , usually just ` ab dor ' ) may be a pre - main sequence star was questioned by micela et al .  ( 1997 ) .",
    "still , ab dor turns out to be very probably near to the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) .",
    "zuckerman et al.s ( 2004 ) checking of the galactic space motions of the moving group that contains ab dor indicates an age of about 50 my .",
    "the youth of the system was confirmed in part by lithium abundance studies ( rucinski , 1982 , hussain et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "there are various markers of ab dor s magnetic activity . as well as the short - term ` starspot ' behaviour , photometric studies over long periods",
    "have shown the average brightness goes through cycles over the years .",
    "observations over the period 1978 - 88 , showed the star s average brightness to decrease steadily , reaching a minimum by the end of this interval .",
    "subsequently , increases over the years 2000 - 2004 were observed and a maximum level reached ( amado et al . , 2001 ; jrvinen et al . ,",
    "this longer - term variation has been seen as an indicator of solar - type cycles .",
    "another indicator of ab dor s magnetic fields is its active chromosphere .",
    "this is marked by the presence of strong caii and h alpha emission ( bidelman & macconnell , 1973 ; vilhu et al .",
    ", 1987 ; budding et al . , 2009 ) . as well",
    ", the active corona gives rise to strong and variable radio and x - ray radiation ( pakull , 1981 ; slee et al . , 1986 ) , although the evidence from different spectral regions is not clear - cut regarding indications of activity ( krster et al .",
    ", 1997 ) .",
    "the presence of enlarged coronal structures on ab dor has been discussed at least since the giant loop model of mestel and spruit ( 1987 ) , as well as the observational confirmation of emitting material linked to plasma at heights of order several stellar radii above the photosphere by collier cameron and robinson ( 1989 ) .",
    "loop sizes were inferred from analysis of the fading of x - ray flares observed with the bepposax satellite by maggio et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , but flaring - loop heights were , in that case , taken to be somewhat smaller ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) , since the flares were observed to continue through all the rotation cycle without showing any eclipse effects , so that their source should not be far above the polar regions .",
    "the rotation axis is believed to be inclined at @xmath860@xmath17 to the line of sight .",
    "other methods have tended to support this scale of size for x - ray emitting structures ( sanz - forcada et al .",
    ", 2003 ; hussain et al . , 2005 . )    a comprehensive assessment of coronal energization , involving x - ray observations repeatedly collected over a three year period from the xmm - newton and chandra satellites was given by sanz - forcada et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and summarized by sanz - forcada et al .",
    "loop sizes were inferred to come in a distribution of sizes , but mostly relatively small compared to the stellar radius .",
    "the high energy tail of electron energy distributions was found to vary significantly with the general activity state of the star .",
    "hussain et al .",
    "( 2007 ) combined evidence from the rotational modulation of the x - ray flux with high dispersion ground spectroscopy to produce detailed maps of likely emission configurations .",
    "possible geometries of coronal emission regions were also considered by lim et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who examined radio data - sets comparable to ours .",
    "evidence on flare region geometry is , as a whole , rather incomplete and often somewhat indirect , however .",
    "modelling tends to involve many adjustable parameters , implying over - determined curve - fittings and ambiguous results .",
    "ab dor has been the subject of a number of previous satellite - based studies : for example , rucinski et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; mewe et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ; krster et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; vilhu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; schmitt et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; maggio et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and others , as discussed by sanz - forcada et al .",
    "repetitive phase - linked phenomena have demonstrated the presence of localized inhomogeneities , with effects involving large - scale photospheric magnetic field concentrations , through to chromospheric and transition region condensations and on to hot coronal plasma volumes typically in the range of several to a few tens of millions of k  occasionally more extreme .",
    "recently , lalitha & schmitt ( 2013 ) have considered the relationship between trends of x - ray emission and optical mean flux , associated , tentatively , with a 17 y period .",
    "lalitha & schmitt found that the high basal level of x - ray emission associated with the strong activity of ab dor a does vary in response to the expected long - term cycling , but the amplitude of this background emission is not so great compared with other known cases , in particular the sun .",
    "so although the solar example continues to underlie many of the concepts , as with quiescent and active conditions , the situation of ab dor can involve structures and energies at least a couple of orders of magnitude greater .",
    "alternative scenarios can be applied to the emission mechanisms , and further clarification of this subject forms a strong motivation for the present work .",
    "the cyclic , quasi - repetitive character of ab dor s radio behaviour , over long periods of time , confirms the existence of structures maintaining the same longitude .",
    "the sources are explained in terms of field concentrations that slowly migrate over a number of years .",
    "lim et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , from studying radio emission peaks and simultaneous optical data , deduced the emission to arise from close to the spotted areas .",
    "many repeated phenomena from photosphere , chromosphere and corona thus point to the presence of ` active longitudes ' .",
    "notwithstanding the foregoing argument on flaring loop heights , there is also evidence of very extended coronal condensations .",
    "for example , the fuse ( far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ) and hst ( hubble space telescope ) have observed transition region lines ( civ 1548 , siiv 1393  and ovi 1032 , @xmath18",
    "k ) , with speeds of up to 270 km s@xmath12 . an extended region of optically thin plasma , with high - level co - rotation , at heights up to 2.6 @xmath19 was then suggested ( brandt et al . , 2001 ;",
    "ake et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "doppler imaging techniques were often applied to ab dor ( krster et al . , 1994 ; unruh and collier cameron , 1994 ; donati and collier cameron , 1997 ; donati et al . , 1999 , hussain et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "these studies of the surface distribution of active regions have demonstrated the persistence of two dominant spot longitudes , but at different latitudes .",
    "donati and collier cameron s ( 1997 ) account of ab dor from optical cross - correlation techniques concluded that the scale of differential rotation was approximately 40 times greater than that of the sun .",
    "this would then suggest a preferred latitude for spots ( in a given hemisphere ) , or the differential rotation would soon produce different phases for the recurrent maculation wave on which the ephemeris and consequent longitude system is based .",
    "launched in 2005 , suzaku is engaged in observations of astronomical x - ray sources that form part of a joint programme of the japanese institute of space and astronautical science ( isas - jaxa ) in collaboration with nasa - gsfc and other organizations ( cf .",
    "mitsuda et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "three of suzaku s four x - ray detectors of the imaging spectrometer ( xis ) were operable during our allocations . a hard x - ray detector ( hxd ) sensitive over the energy range 0.2 - 600 kev with low background and an angular resolution that should allow application to research on brighter flare stars was also available .",
    "a suzaku proposal for observations of ab dor was thus made in early 2006 with an aim to research the high - energy non - thermal electron population , particularly during the initial flare impulse .",
    "possible detection of very hard , non - thermal x - rays could allow better understanding of the triggering mechanism .",
    "the x - ray observations , made simultaneously with the radio ones , were carried out in november 2006 and january 2007 .",
    "unfortunately , the signal from the hxd during these observations did not permit reliable analysis ( arnaud , private communication ) .",
    "however , the xis ( intermediate energy ) data show interesting effects .",
    "the xis has a field of approximately 18 arcmin square covered by the three available detectors xis0 , 1 , and 3 .",
    "the angular resolutions of the suzaku telescopes range from 1.8 to 2.3 arcmin half - power diameter .",
    "this resolution does not significantly depend on the energy of the incident x - rays in the available range , but it entails that all four known components of the multiple star are covered by the acceptance beam .",
    "the archived chandra data from 2004 ( http://cda.harvard.edu/ pop/ ) , has much higher angular resolution and it shows two separate sources with both a 52 ks exposure using the hetg , and an 85 ks exposure with the letg grating , in the positions of ab dor a and b on the sky .",
    "aperture photometry of these images shows the ab dor a source ( as enclosed within a 1.7 arcsec radius aperture ) to have an average flux density of 83.3% of the sum of the two sources with the hetg instrument , and 87.8% with the letg .",
    "since these exposures cover time intervals of the order of a day , there is a good chance that they would have included a flare , but mostly the output would be dominated by accumulated quiescent emission from the two heated coronae in the proportions 5.7 to 1 , for ab dor a to b.    the simultaneous , higher angular resolution , radio observations show that three large flares occurred from ab dor a during the joint coverage .",
    "the x - ray cameras registered distinct flares around the same times .",
    "further insights are gained when the x - ray and microwave observations are superposed , as discussed in section 4 .",

    "the x - ray data were taken from the heasarc archive ( nasa , cf .",
    "white , 1992 ) .",
    "heasoft reductional software , including ftools and xanadu , is similarly available . in figure  1",
    "we show the integrated xis raw data over the range 0.3 to 10 kev from the two observation dates .",

    "individual 30 s integrations with the separate cameras during quiescent intervals show a typical scatter of about 12%  of measured levels .",
    "this implies that time averaged values covering a few hours of quiescence would reduce the error of a representative mean to a few percent .",
    "we can check this in the foregoing averaged values , i.e.@xmath21 erg @xmath11 s@xmath12 , for the nov data and @xmath22 erg @xmath11 s@xmath12 , for the more active jan data .",

    "this calls on the tuebingen - boulder ism absorption model tbabs , which accounts for the intervening effects of the interstellar medium .",
    "since the modelling is overdetermined by the available parameter - set , our approach was minimalistic in trying to find the smallest number of independent parameters consistent with the data .",

    "x - ray fluxes from stellar coronae are characterized by a distribution of emission measures ( emd ) for the various contributing species to the net emission .",
    "the flux normally shows a distinct maximum , with a corresponding brightness temperature @xmath25 , typically in the order of 10 mk .",
    "the brightness temperature @xmath26 can be related to the emd through a proportionality of the form ( @xmath26/@xmath27 .",

    "the angular resolution was sufficient to show that the m - type dwarf binary , ab dor b , remained relatively quiescent on all three nights and it is clear that the fluxes measured for ab dor a are not significantly influenced by the companion .",
    "the scale of noise in the measurements is provided by both uvflux and uvfit .",
    "the relatively strong cross - correlation of the c and x - band data , discussed later , provides further confirmation of the reality of the signal excursions during flaring episodes .",

    "from this , we propose the following spectral model over the frequency range from 10 mhz to 300  ghz :    * \\(a ) s(@xmath44 ) = a@xmath45 between 0.01 and 4.80  ghz * \\(b ) s(@xmath44 ) = b@xmath46 between 4.80 and 20  ghz * \\(c ) s(@xmath44 ) = c@xmath47 between 20 and 300  ghz    where s(@xmath44 ) is the flux density and a and b are constants that can be evaluated by substituting in the appropriate equation a measured value of flux density at a particular frequency .",
    "for the highest frequency range we have no data directly available , but we can tailor the observed result for the middle range of frequencies into a feasible high - frequency fall - off , using the known properties of solar flares as a guide ( e.g.  hurford , 1986 ) . using the 4.80  ghz peak flux density in table  [ table :",

    "2 on 2007 january 08 as the reference , we find a = 1.20 , b = 9.99 , c = 332 .",
    "examination of the errors of the flux measures at the respective frequencies show a can be estimated to within @xmath48% of its real value , while b should be accurate to within @xmath49% for a given flare .",
    "the high frequency extension illustrates the point that a considerable amount of flare radiation is likely beyond what is typically considered in microwave flux calculations .",
    "integrating over the three frequency ranges with this model , we find the peak power emitted by flare 2 on january 08 is 5.12@xmath910@xmath50  w. here we use a distance to ab dor of 14.9  pc .",
    "table  [ table : flares ] indicates that a typical flare duration to half  brightness is about 3  hours , yielding a total energy output of 5.5@xmath910@xmath51  j. since the peak flux densities of the identified flares in table  [ table : flares ] vary by about a factor of 5 - 7 at 4.80 and 8.64  ghz , but their durations appear similar , their total energy outputs are likely to vary by similar proportions .",
    "these estimates of peak and total powers are necessarily uncertain , because we have direct values of the spectral indices only over a small frequency range and , even then , the averaged indices @xmath34 and @xmath35 have uncertainties of around 15 and 20% respectively . but the uncertainties at the low and intermediate frequencies have relatively small weight on the total result : it is in the range above 20  ghz that there may be significant departures from the radio flare energies typically considered .",
    "even with the comparatively steep spectral index of 1.5 , this region would contribute more than half of the total radio emission .      a good idea of the temporal intensity structure in the radio measurements",

    "the adopted auto - correlation function is the geometric mean of the 4.80 and 8.64  ghz functions .",
    "the cross - correlations are plotted and fitted with gaussians , from which the shifts listed in the caption to fig  9 were determined .",
    "these time shifts are significant at the 3 - 4 @xmath2 level .",
    "a good description of the applied technique that includes appropriate discussion of significance tests was given by moore ( 1958 ) .",
    "the use of the gaussian fitting function , apart from its empirical validity in the region of the maximum , can be understood intuitively in terms of the scattering effect of the turbulent medium on emerging radiation fronts , given their inferred spatial separation .        .",
    "[ ab_dor_correlations_48_86 ]    the resulting correlation functions are presented in figure  [ ab_dor_correlations_48_86 ] , which shows that the cross - correlations are systematically displaced in a negative direction with respect to the mean auto - correlations .",
    "the trend of negative shifts for the nov 21 , 2006 data yielded a mean lag of 4.50@xmath391.30 min .",
    "the more regular cross - correlation function for the jan 08 , 2007 observations gave a mean shift of 4.00@xmath391.13 min .",
    "the lags should thus be regarded as confirmed at the 3@xmath2 level .",
    "similar findings were reported by budding et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , whose correlation analysis of four long observations of ab dor in 1994 and 1997 yielded shifts of 4.0 to 6.5  min . on three of the four nights ( table 1 in budding et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "typical errors for these determinations were given as @xmath52 min , so while differences in the x to c - band shifts for individual flares can not be reliably specified , the shifts themselves can be regarded as well - confirmed with closely comparable results obtained on 5 out of 6 independent data - sets .    apart from these intercorrelations of the microwave data - sets themselves , there is interest in the correlation that such data may have with contemporaneous observations at higher photon energies ( forbrich et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "such correlations can illuminate physical understanding of flare energetics .",
    "figure  3 in forbrich et al .",
    "( 2011 ) shows detailed plots of the microwave variations against contemporaneous x - ray observations for 5 well - known active stars , including the physically comparable object cc eri , mentioned above .",
    "in fact , if we use the measured flare fluxes : in the x - ray region from section 2.1 , and in the c - band from table 2 , and convert to the same ( cgs ) luminosity scales used in forbrich et al.s figure  3 , we will find representative points for these ab dor flares ( x - ray : 1.1 - 1.6@xmath910@xmath53 ; c - band : 5 - 10@xmath910@xmath54 hz@xmath12 ) reasonably typical among the accumulation of points for cc eri towards the lower left of the diagram ( see figure  [ ab_dor_xradcor ] ) .",
    "the existence of such correlations between x - ray fluxes and microwave emission is taken , in a general way , to support the view that the radio emission originates from the tail of the maxwellian electron distribution of a very hot plasma through the gyrosynchrotron process ; the same , flare - generating , electron population being involved in both emissions .",
    "although this model has the appeal of physical unification , detailed matching of the quantities involved leads to complications associated with the structure , properties and geometry of the sources .",
    "these are not the same for all events , as discussed below .",
    "budding et al .  ( 2009 ) reviewed in some detail photometry and spectroscopy of ab dor that formed a subset of the present multiwavelength study .",
    "the broadband light curves were dominated by one outstanding macula , while the spectroscopic features suggested several chromospheric activity sites , one strong concentration of which , located near phase zero , could be associated with the main macula .",
    "these findings led to the surmise of a large bipolar surface structure that was linked to the site of contemporaneous multiwavelength activity .",
    "our subsequent reduction and analysis of the suzaku data are compromised , to some extent , by the lack of a clear resolution between the two sources .",
    "this certainly holds for the quiescent emission levels , where previous long duration observations by the chandra satellite point to the source ab dor a predominating by a factor of typically @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , our present x - ray data show clear links between the major x - ray and microwave flares , which support the idea of one large magnetodynamic activity generator that may be given an approximate position on the surface of ab dor during late 2006 and early 2007 .    the x - ray data , newly presented in this article , may have a special role in placing the sequence of events in flare energization . in this connection ,",
    "x - ray spectral indices for the suzaku data for nov 2006 and jan 2007 were measured and their behaviour shown in figure  4 .",
    "the data cover quiescent and flaring phases .",
    "of special interest are the near peak regions , particularly the second flare of the jan 2007 data that shows an initial impulse and subsequent second peak occurring after the intermediate microwave peak ( see figure  [ ab_dor_xfigt ] ) .    the higher - energy quiescent fluxes ( not reliably measurable in the highest frequency range for quiescent gtis )",
    "were consistent with the full x - ray spectra shown in figure  2 , and the formula @xmath55 .",
    "the spectral index @xmath56 = 3 is often adopted in theoretical treatments and our x - ray spectral indices are broadly in agreement with this .",
    "dulk ( 1985 ) shows the variation of absorption and emission coefficients for microwave radiation to be quite sensitive to the value of @xmath56 for gyrosynchrotron emission .",
    "the effective temperature has a moderate dependence , while the degree of circular polarization is less affected .",
    "it would clearly be useful to take into account observational evidence on @xmath56 in more detailed modelling of the radio emission .",
    "an interesting point arising from the juxtaposition of the x - ray and microwave flux variations ( fig .",
    "[ ab_dor_xfigt ] ) is whether the initial sharp impulse on the second flare of jan 8 ( gti 12 ) corresponds to a high - energy trigger preceding the microwave maxima .",
    "this behaviour has been seen in previous similar event sequences ( budding et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "if we compare the spectral indices for gtis 9 , 12 and 13 ( jan 8/9 ) there is not much difference between those of 9 and 12  i.e.  the initial impulse of the second ( smaller ) flare is no harder than the decline phase of the first flare .",
    "that points to a much more powerful initial impulse to that first flare that was not detected during the observations .",
    "all these gtis do , however , have significantly harder spectral indices than the quiescent spectrum .",
    "the index hardens to around 0.5 greater than during quiescence , maximizing , in these data sets , at the earliest stage of the second flare . on the other hand ,",
    "that second flare of jan 8 is definitely softer after the intervening microwave peak .",
    "the x - ray spectral index declines by about 30% in the second x - ray maximum , which can be associated with near - footpoint bremsstrahlung radiation ( bastian et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the gentler downward slope of the x - rays in the post - microwave maxima phases of this flare concurs with the neupert effect here . a reasonably self - consistent overall picture for the observed flare sequence",
    "can then be presented , on the basis that there was a first very large but unseen impulse to the first flare , while for the second ( weaker ) flare we observe the whole sequence : initial impulse , gyrosynchrotron cooling and then bremsstrahlung from precipitated electrons .",
    "this picture can be placed alongside the interpretation of optical and radio data given by budding et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , where it was found reasonable to associate the radio observations of 2006 november and 2007 january to one large and predominating visual macula of around 14 - 15 deg angular radius , longitude 5 - 10 deg and latitude around 50 - 60 deg .",
    "a large chromospheric facular region could also be linked to this macula .",
    "this active region comes into full view near phase zero , when the first of the jan 2007 flares occurs .",
    "the second major flare of the jan 2007 observations ( as well as the nov 2006 one ) , however , occurs around phases 0.6 - 0.7 , which is about the location of ` facula b ' , the second major chromospheric feature detected from the h@xmath57 emission line structure by budding et al .",
    "although about the same , or slightly weaker , in x - rays ( the first flare s x - ray start looks to have been missed ) , this flare has a stronger microwave peak .",
    "although this flare may then be of intrinsically lower energy than the first one , a reasonable inference is that the source geometry happens to give us a better view , including its initial impulsive phase",
    ".    it would be unwise to put too much weight on this scenario from just the limited amount of data presented here  but our interpretation is worth retaining for further testing against more data that should be expected in future .",
    "we thank the time allocation committee of the australia telescope national facility for two generous allocations on the atca to support this multiwavelength campaign .",
    "the original proposal and arrangements for acquiring time on the suzaku satellite actually came from dr mark audard , of geneva ; to whom we express our gratitude for his early inputs and suggestions .",
    "dr grigor tsarevsky of the sternberg institute , moscow also contributed greatly with advice and observational assistance .",
    "we thank also the staff of the armagh observatory , who helped n.e.progress this work , particularly dr g.  ramsay in relation to the processing of the suzaku data and subsequent comments on its discussion .",
