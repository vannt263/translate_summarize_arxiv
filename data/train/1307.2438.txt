    "so with probability @xmath132 a non - defective has a score of @xmath129 after @xmath3 segments .",
    "setting @xmath133 maximizes the latter probability , as was previously noted in  @xcite , and eventually leads to an asymptotic code length of @xmath134 so also for @xmath135 we end up with improved asymptotics for @xmath3 , compared to the @xmath136 of  @xcite .",
    "we saw in sect .  [ sub : finetune ] that we may use the fact that the result of a test is never positive when one of the defective items is present in the pool , to fine - tune the score function and find all defectives even more efficiently .",
    "however , such certainties generally do not exist , as tests may have a small probability of not returning the correct result . here",
    "we discuss two noisy group testing models previously considered in the literature , and show what the asymptotics on @xmath3 become .",
    "details on how these results were obtained are in the full version .      in the dilution model",
    "@xcite , we assume that a test may not come back positive even if a defective item is present in the tested pool , because this defective item may be _ inactive _ with a small probability @xmath21 .",
    "this means that the probability that a defective item contributes a @xmath20 to the test result is now not @xmath35 , but @xmath137 . in this model ,",
    "optimizing @xmath36 leads to the centered and quasi - normalized score function given in table  [ tab:1 ] . to minimize @xmath79 , we again need to take @xmath106 close to @xmath43 , in which case the asymptotic code length becomes @xmath138 this is somewhat comparable to a result of  @xcite which has a factor @xmath139 in the denominator .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      another commonly considered noise model is that of additive noise  @xcite , where the final extraction of the test result may not always be correct . in particular , we assume that we are in the ordinary group testing model , but the output @xmath28 may also be @xmath20 with probability @xmath21 if no defectives were actually present in the test . for this model , after fine - tuning @xmath36 we get the score function given in table  [ tab:1 ] . to optimize the leading term of @xmath79 for fixed @xmath140 , one should choose @xmath106 to satisfy @xmath141 , which corresponds to @xmath142 . for the asymptotics of the code length",
    "we then get @xmath143 note that atia and saligrama  @xcite showed that a code length of the order @xmath144 is already sufficient , and that our result , although practical , does not achieve this bound .",
    "finally , a model that has also been considered before is _ threshold _ group testing  @xcite , where a test result may only be positive if sufficiently many defective items are present in the tested pool . we will restrict our attention to the case where the test result is a ( non - deterministic ) function only of the number of defectives in a tested pool",
    "this means that all defectives are treated symmetrically , and the test result does not depend on how many non - defectives were present in the tested group . in all models",
    ", it is assumed that : if at most @xmath145 defectives are present in a test , the output will be negative ; if at least @xmath146 defectives are present , the test result is positive ; and if the number of defectives @xmath147 in a group test lies between @xmath148 and @xmath149 , the result depends on the specific model .",
    "details on the following results can be found in the full version .",
    "this model was introduced in  @xcite , and considers the case where @xmath150 if and only if more than half the defectives are present in the tested pool",
    ". this corresponds to @xmath151 and @xmath152 . in this case , the score function @xmath36 becomes a mess , but not if we immediately set @xmath35 to its optimal value , which turns out to be @xmath153 . in that case",
    ", the score function reduces to the trivial function of @xmath154 for matches and @xmath128 for differences , as shown in table  [ tab:1 ] . working out the details for large @xmath1 leads to an asymptotic code length of @xmath155 interpolating between the ordinary group testing model and majority group testing , one might expect that if @xmath156 with @xmath157 , the optimal value of @xmath35 is around @xmath158 and the asymptotics on @xmath3 are between @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "the bernoulli gap model was previously considered in  @xcite , and says that if the number of defectives in a pool is between @xmath148 and @xmath149 , the probability that the test outcome is positive equals @xmath161 .",
    "we will focus on the extreme case of @xmath162 and @xmath163 , although a similar analysis may be done for other values of @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "first , the optimal score function follows from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "22 ) and is given in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "as in ordinary group testing , the optimal value of @xmath35 lies close to @xmath43 , and for large @xmath1 the asymptotic scaling of @xmath3 is given by @xmath164 again , interpolating between several results , if the gap between @xmath145 and @xmath146 decreases , we conjecture that the constant @xmath3 goes down from @xmath165 to @xmath159 if @xmath166 or @xmath167 , and from @xmath165 to @xmath160 if @xmath168 .      in the linear gap model  @xcite , the probability of the test result to be positive scales linearly with the number of defectives in the tested pool .",
    "we will again only focus on the case of an extreme gap ( @xmath162 and @xmath163 ) for ease of computation .",
    "first , the optimal centered and normalized score function follows from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prop .  9 ) and is given in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "as shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "10 ) , for this model we have @xmath169 regardless of @xmath35 , so the best we can do is choose @xmath35 such that @xmath170 is minimized .",
    "this leads to @xmath153 and @xmath171 , and the asymptotic code length becomes @xmath172 for large @xmath2 this slightly improves upon a previous result of del lungo et al .",
    "@xcite , who gave an adaptive scheme with a code length of @xmath173 .",
    "finally , if we assume that the output will be a @xmath43 if no defectives are present , the output is @xmath20 if all defectives are present , and we do not know what happens when _ some _ defectives are included in the test , then we are back at the traitor tracing game . for this game",
    "it is known that in the non - adaptive setting , the capacity - achieving choice is to use the same score function as in the linear gap model , but to vary @xmath35 for each test by independently drawing it each time from the arcsine distribution ( with distribution function @xmath174 on @xmath175 ) .",
    "this leads to the so - called interleaving defense , discussed in  @xcite , with an asymptotic code length of @xmath26 .",
    "this result is the same as in the linear gap model , which motivates why the linear gap model is the hardest group testing model to deal with .",
    "in this paper we considered a new framework for probabilistic non - adaptive and adaptive group testing schemes , based on combining several results from traitor tracing .",
    "this lead to efficient group testing schemes for various models .",
    "although in this work we applied results from traitor tracing to group testing , one may wonder whether something can be done in the other direction as well .",
    "with the recent traitor tracing result of  @xcite achieving capacity in the non - adaptive traitor tracing game , the latter game seems kind of  solved \" . for the adaptive traitor tracing game",
    "one important open question remains , which is establishing the adaptive ( dynamic ) traitor tracing capacity .",
    "not much is known about this yet , but perhaps combining previous techniques from adaptive group testing  @xcite and non - adaptive traitor tracing  @xcite may bring us closer to a solution .",
    "the author is grateful to jan - jaap oosterwijk for many valuable suggestions and insightful discussions .",
