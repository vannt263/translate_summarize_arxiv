    "the historical roots of the subject under investigation go back to the classification of the locally symmetric spaces in the ( proper ) riemannian case by cartan @xcite . _",
    "locally symmetric _ pseudo - riemannian manifolds are characterized by the condition @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the curvature tensor of the manifold .",
    "the pseudo - riemannian manifolds satisfying @xmath2 constitute a logical generalization of the locally symmetric ones .",
    "but in the riemannian case these two conditions are equivalent . moreover , in the riemannian case :    @xmath3    a result based on the orthogonal de rham decomposition @xcite . in this riemannian case",
    "the natural generalization are the semi - symmetric spaces ( introduced in @xcite , studied in @xcite ) defined by the relation @xmath4 for all vector fields @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the curvature operator @xmath7}$ ] .    in the lorentzian case ( [ 1 ] ) does not hold , because of the failure of the orthogonal de rham decomposition @xcite .",
    "in fact ,    @xmath8 ,    where the metric @xmath9 is extended to the inner product between tensor fields in the standard fashion .",
    "so in the lorentzian case we can introduce the _ second - order symmetric _",
    "( also called _",
    "2-symmetric _ ) spaces @xcite , i.e. , the spaces that satisfy the condition @xmath2 .",
    "the following relations hold : @xmath10 in this contribution we present a specific result from @xcite .",
    "namely , we find the 2-symmetric non - symmetric 4-dimensional spacetimes : the explicit local form of the metric , classification and properties",
    ". the main result is summarized in the following theorem :    [ t3 ] a 2-symmetric non - symmetric 4-dimensional spacetime @xmath11 is locally isometric to @xmath12 endowed with the metric @xmath13 where @xmath14 for some constants @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the starting point for this proof is theorem 4.2 in @xcite . from this theorem",
    "follows that a 2-symmetric non - symmetric spacetime must have a null parallel vector field and therefore its metric is of brinkmann type : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are functions independent of @xmath21 , otherwise arbitrary .    using the 2-symmetry condition",
    ", one can prove that @xmath22 must be locally symmetric on each slice @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "since the only locally symmetric 2-dimensional riemannian spaces are the constant curvature ones , we have that in appropriate local coordinates @xmath24    in fact , @xmath25 must vanish . to prove this",
    ", we use the petrov classification @xcite .",
    "by @xcite we know that all the semi - symmetric spacetimes ( of dimension @xmath26 ) are of type @xmath27 , @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , as a consequence of this result , it was also proven that the 2-symmetric spacetimes are of petrov type @xmath28 , or its degenerate case , @xmath29 . and",
    "this only happens when @xmath30 .",
    "hence , the line element of a 2-symmetric non - symmetric 4-dimensional spacetime @xmath11 simplifies to @xmath31 from now on , an overdot means derivative with respect to @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    using the cartan method ( see , for example , @xcite ) to calculate the connection 1-forms and the curvature 2-forms for the null coframe @xmath35 and solving the 2-symmetry equations in this frame ,",
    "we conclude that there exist functions @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 such that @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and the following equations must be satisfied : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49    the proof can then be completed by noticing that eqs.([ww2 ] ) , ( [ ww3 ] ) and ( [ h3 ] ) together with ( [ 2s1])([2s5 ] ) permit the coordinate change needed to arrive at the final form of the metric .",
    "this change of coordinates is given by @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 it is easily verified that the functions @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be chosen such that the line - element becomes @xmath58 where @xmath59 for some new functions @xmath60 , because the integrability conditions of the resulting differential equations are always met by virtue of equations ( [ ww2])([2s5 ] ) .    to finalize the proof of theorem [ t3 ] , one simply has to solve the equations ( [ 2s1])-([2s5 ] ) appropriately restricted to the new form of the metric ( [ me3 ] ) with ( [ h5 ] )",
    "this readily implies that @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 must be linear functions : @xmath64    the condition @xmath16 must be enforced as otherwise @xmath0 and the spacetime would be locally symmetric .",
    "we would like to stress that , even though the family of metrics obtained in therorem [ t3 ] depend on six parameters , a further analysis shows that only four of them are essential parameters , and the other two can be removed by the remaining freedom of coordinates .",
    "similarly , we want to remark that our result is local .",
    "a global classification is also feasible , though some global hypotheses on the spacetime seem unavoidable to that end .",
    "such kind of hypotheses may involve the topology of the manifold , geodesics or causality ( see @xcite for a study of the last two issues in some wave - type spacetimes ) .",
    "in particular , it seems that the local solutions obtained in theorem [ t3 ] are also the unique global 4-dimensional solutions under the requirements of simple connectedness and geodesic completeness .",
    "an open question is whether or not the above pattern is maintained for higher - order symmetric 4-dimensional spacetimes .",
    "specifically , we wonder if the @xmath65-symmetric spacetimes ( those with @xmath66 ) are given , for general @xmath65 , precisely by the line - element ( [ me3 ] ) with ( [ h5 ] ) where the functions @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are polynomials of degree @xmath65 .",
    "a more important open question is the extension of the result to higher dimensions . of course",
    ", many more possibilities appear in this general case , which are being analyzed in @xcite .",
