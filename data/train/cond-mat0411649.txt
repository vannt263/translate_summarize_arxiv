    "crystal - field ( cf ) theory@xcite is one of the most powerful theoretical methods to deal with the magnetic properties of rare - earth ( re ) and actinide ( an ) ions , and stevens operator equivalents formalism is still the most commonly used to analyze experimental data due to its simplicity .",
    "unfortunately , this approach concentrates only on the cf splittings within the lowest - lying @xmath1 multiplet of the considered ion , completely neglecting the contributions of excited multiplets ( `` @xmath0 mixing '' ) .",
    "although the task of diagonalizing the large matrices related to the full @xmath2 configuration , including different @xmath0 multiplets , is relatively easy to perform numerically by means of today s computers , stevens approach often makes it possible to obtain analytical expressions for physical quantities of interest for systems of sufficiently high symmetry , thus leading to a deeper insight on the physics of several compounds .    in the present paper",
    ", we discuss a perturbative approach which retains the validity of stevens formalism while correctly taking into account @xmath0-mixing effects .",
    "this method , which has led to interesting results for transition - metal ( tm ) based molecular clusters@xcite and ferromagnetic exchange - driven re - tm intermetallic compounds@xcite is now applied to evaluate the intramultiplet cf splittings in light an and re ions .",
    "we exploit the method to analyze the cf of actinide dioxides .",
    "these large - gap semiconductors are among the most studied actinide compounds .",
    "although @xmath3-electrons are well localized , the complexity of the magnetic hamiltonian , which includes cf and magnetoelastic single - ion interactions , phonon - transmitted quadrupolar interactions , and multipolar superexchange couplings between neighboring ions , leads to a number of interesting and unusual physical phenomena . among them",
    ", we mention the proposed octupolar phase transition in npo@xmath4,@xcite the observed cf - phonon bound states in npo@xmath4,@xcite and the peculiar static and dynamic phenomena produced by magnetoelastic interactions in uo@xmath4,@xcite some of which are not yet fully understood .",
    "the cf potential is the fundamental building block of any theoretical model of the properties of dioxides , since this influences the single - ion behavior to a large extent . in particular",
    ", it determines which degrees of freedom of the @xmath3 shell are left unquenched and the size of the corresponding multipole moments , which account for the low-@xmath5 physical properties .",
    "most of the published theoretical approaches are based on the above - mentioned stevens treatment of the cf , which includes only the lowest russell - saunders or intermediate - coupling multiplet of the ion . if one takes as starting point the cf of uo@xmath4 , on which very detailed information is available by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments,@xcite then scaling the cf of uo@xmath4 within the stevens framework ( to take into account the different ionic radii ) provides a good cf model for npo@xmath4 .",
    "however , the same scheme applied to puo@xmath4 is only qualitatively satisfactory , since it reproduces the correct level sequence but it underestimates the observed energy splitting .",
    "moreover , this approach is not internally consistent because the so - obtained cf parameters yield different results when additional ionic multiplets are included in the calculation . on the other hand ,",
    "the increased complexity of @xmath0 mixing calculations makes particularly hard to find cf parameter sets working consistently over the various compounds .",
    "indeed , different sets have been proposed so far for dioxides within @xmath0 mixing calculations . in particular , in npo@xmath4 two distinct and equally good sets of parameters had been obtained.@xcite    by our perturbative @xmath0 mixing approach , we have been able to obtain a unique set which works well over all the considered compounds .",
    "following ref .  , the total free - ion and crystal - field hamiltonian @xmath6 , with @xmath7 can be rewritten in the form @xmath8 where in the present case @xmath9 coincides with @xmath10 and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are chosen so that the former has nonzero matrix elements only between states belonging the the same @xmath1 multiplet .",
    "it is possible to define a hermitian operator @xmath13 such that the matrix element of the transformed hamiltonian @xmath14 are very small in the off - diagonal blocks , thus restoring the possibility to use an isolated - multiplet approach . in this framework,@xcite @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 label free ion manifolds and @xmath18 are the eigenvalues of @xmath19 . for clarity , in the following we will label the states as in the russell - saunders scheme , where @xmath20 coincides with @xmath21 and any additional quantum number necessary to identify the terms ; yet the actual calculation will include intermediate coupling corrections to the eigenfunctions .",
    "once we limit our calculations to the ground @xmath0 multiplet only , the first term on the right - hand side of the above equation represents a uniform energy shift of the whole multiplet , while the second term is the usual ground - multiplet cf hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "the effect of @xmath0-mixing is accounted for by the third term , which will be considered as an extra contribution to the ground - multiplet hamiltonian and labelled @xmath23 ( we maintain the redundant superscript @xmath24 notation in order to emphasize that the newly obtained @xmath0-mixing hamiltonian _ also _ acts on the ground multiplet _ only _ ) .    in the case of light actinides ,",
    "the most important @xmath0 mixing contribution comes from the two lowest @xmath0-multiplets , i.e. @xmath1 and @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , for the sake of simplicity we restrict our analysis to the case of these two multiplets , separated by an energy gap @xmath26 by the spin - orbit interaction . from eq .",
    "[ daslichter ] , @xmath23 can be written as @xmath27 @xmath28 the wigner - eckart theorem , in the form @xmath29 allows us to get rid of the sum over @xmath30 in eq .",
    "[ mix1 ] , since the @xmath31 symbol in eq .",
    "[ wigeck ] equals zero if @xmath32 .",
    "the products of @xmath31 symbols can be rewritten as linear combinations of matrix elements of stevens operators @xmath33,@xcite so that @xmath34 where the `` mixing operators '' @xmath35 are@xcite @xmath36 with conveniently defined @xmath37 coefficients .",
    "let us consider the simple but important case of cubic symmetry , for which the cf hamiltonian ( [ hcfgeneral ] ) has the form @xmath38 + b_{6}^{0}\\left [ c_{0}^{(6)}-\\sqrt{% \\frac{7}{2}}\\left ( c_{4}^{(6)}+c_{-4}^{(6)}\\right ) \\right ] .",

    "we define @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the expectation values of the @xmath44 operator over the appropriate @xmath3-electron wavefunction .",
    "it is found that @xmath23 maintains the cubic symmetry , and has the form @xmath45 where we did not explicitly write the terms containing operators of rank higher than 8 since @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the maximum possible value for the ground state of light lanthanides and actinides.@xcite the coefficients appearing in eq .",

    "the reduced matrix elements @xmath53 are calculated by using the intermediate coupling free - ion wavefunctions .    ions with 6 @xmath3 electrons have a @xmath54 ground singlet , so that no intramultiplet energy splitting can exist and @xmath0-mixing effects are evident only in the wavefunction composition ; this case is then impossible to study by the present approach . as for ions with half - filled @xmath3 shell such as gd@xmath55 , cm@xmath55 , and bk@xmath56 ,",
    "@xmath0 mixing is generally negligible and it hardly affects any physical property .",
    "finally , the perturbative @xmath0-mixing approach is in principle suitable to study heavy @xmath3-electron ions ( @xmath57 ) , taking into account that the ground @xmath0 multiplet is mixed with @xmath58 states , instead of @xmath59 .",
    "however , in this case the advantage of using the perturbative model with respect to the numerical diagonalization of @xmath60 over a complete @xmath2 basis could be significantly reduced , because : _ i _ ) the use of stevens operators of rank 10 ( 12 ) becomes necessary for @xmath61 ( 6 ) ; _ ii _ ) it is not always possible to diagonalize @xmath62 analytically , even in cubic symmetry . in any case , the expected @xmath0-mixing strength is much smaller for heavy than for light elements .",
    "in order to show in detail how the present model can be applied to the study of rare - earth and actinide compounds , let us start from the simplest possible configuration : an ion with a single @xmath3 electron .",
    "the only interaction present in the free - ion hamiltonian is the spin - orbit coupling , @xmath64 the @xmath63 spectra is composed of two multiplets only , @xmath65 ( ground state ) and @xmath66 ; adding a crystal field of cubic symmetry , the @xmath67 matrix representing the @xmath68 term is made up of two @xmath69 and two @xmath70 diagonal blocks .",
    "the complete hamiltonian @xmath60 can then be analytically diagonalized , and the resulting energy gap between the @xmath71 doublet and a @xmath72 quartet composing the ground multiplet is @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 .",
    "\\label{f1compl}\\ ] ] although the perturbative approach is not particularly useful here since an exact analytical solution can be obtained , let us study this simple case in order to clarify the details of the process and to understand its limits of validity .",
    "no intermediate coupling occurs , and @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 ; moreover , the spin - orbit gap can be expressed as @xmath80 , with @xmath81 . diagonalizing @xmath82 ( see appendix for details ) , we find @xmath83 which corresponds exactly to the series expansion of eq .",
    "( [ f1compl ] ) up to the first order in @xmath84 .",
    "the intramultiplet energy gap calculated above can be directly measured by means of spectroscopic techniques ; for example , inelastic neutron scattering measurements for pro@xmath85 ( where praseodymium ions have valence 4 + , therefore presenting a @xmath86 electronic configuration ) have shown that @xmath87.@xcite figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the possible solutions of this equation in terms of the crystal - field parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 , with three different expressions : the full black line corresponds to the exact diagonalization of the complete @xmath63 hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ f1compl ] ) ] ;",
    "the dashed vertical line is obtained by neglecting @xmath0 mixing and using stevens approximation @xmath90 ; finally , the dashed - dotted line takes @xmath0 mixing into account perturbatively by the present approach [ eq .",
    "( [ f1appr ] ) ] .",
    "the results are satisfactory : the agreement between the exact ( full ) and approximate ( dashed - dotted ) curves is qualitatively much better if compared with stevens approximation ( dashed line ) , and the quantitative contribution of the excited states is correctly estimated in the small - cf range @xmath91 .",
    "it may be noticed that the three curves of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] almost coincide when @xmath92 , since in this case the largest part of the @xmath0-mixing correction ( which is linear in @xmath89 ) vanishes [ this can be verified by observing the relative magnitude of the different coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ f1appr ] ) ] . for the same reason , for small @xmath89 ,",
    "the value of @xmath88 is slightly underestimated for @xmath93 and overestimated for @xmath94 . as the spin - orbit interaction is stronger for heavier ions and the gap between the two lowest multiplets grows with @xmath0",
    ", we expect our model to have a reasonably good performance over the whole lanthanide and actinide series .",
    "in this section , the perturbative @xmath0-mixing model outlined so far will be applied to interpret the intramultiplet crystal - field splittings observed by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) for actinide dioxides ano@xmath85 ( an = u , np , pu ) .",
    "the crystal - field analysis will be performed in terms of the parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 [ eq .  ( [ notation ] ) ] instead of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , using the values of @xmath43 given in ref .  .",
    "although recent density functional studies have pointed out a certain degree of covalency for the @xmath97-o bond in these systems,@xcite this does not prevent one from using the crystal field theory to analyze experimental data ; it would be quite more difficult than in a ionic compound to calculate the cf parameters from first principles , but this is not our aim .",
    "we will demonstrate that the present method can be used for an analytical study of the experimental results over a wide range of parameters and compositions .",
    "ins spectra for uo@xmath85 in the paramagnetic phase ( above @xmath98 ) display peaks between 150 ad 185 mev,@xcite which have been attributed to transitions between the @xmath99 ground state@xcite and excited @xmath100 and @xmath101 states , and no other magnetic transitions were reported up to 700 mev@xcite ( it is worth to recall that the @xmath102 transition is not dipole - allowed so , if present , it will display a very small intensity with respect to the other two transitions ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] shows the values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 for which the possible transitions lie within the experimentally observed range according to the perturbative model . in the previous section , we have studied the quantitative discrepancy between the model s predictions and the exact results , which was found to be significant for large cf parameters . following these estimates , we have determined a `` safe zone '' ( indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] by a dashed ellipse ) within which the true set of cf parameters for uo@xmath4 is located with high degree of confidence .    for the paramagnetic phase of npo@xmath85 we have followed amoretti et al.,@xcite who observed a broad magnetic signal centered at 55 mev in the ins spectra and attributed this peak to a transition between the two @xmath72 quartets .",
    "they gave two possible solutions for the paramagnetic phase , labelled 3 and 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ; we show that actually there are infinite possible solutions , divided in two branches .",
    "puo@xmath4 displays a temperature - independend magnetic susceptibility below 1000 k,@xcite so that the cf ground state is expected to be the @xmath103 singlet .",
    "magnetic - dipole matrix elements involving this state within the @xmath104 multiplet are zero except with the @xmath105 triplet .",
    "indeed , only one peak centered at 123 mev is observed in puo@xmath85 ins spectra.@xcite according to our perturbative model there are again infinite possible solutions , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , which cover a large area of the @xmath95-vs-@xmath96 diagram .",
    "it is clear that , in the case of ano@xmath85 , the ins data analysis can not give unambiguous results if every compound is treated separately ; this can also be inferred from the widely scattered sets of parameters which are found in the literature ( some of which are listed in table  [ tab : table2 ] and displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if we assume that the @xmath106 parameters are approximately the same for all isostructural compounds,@xcite an inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows that the only area of the diagram where common solutions for @xmath107u , np , pu might exist is around the point labelled 4 , which corresponds to one of the two solutions ( the `` strong @xmath0-mixing '' one ) proposed by amoretti et al.@xcite for npo@xmath85 ( @xmath108 ; @xmath109 ) . in order to verify this result , we have calculated the ins transition energies for uo@xmath85 , npo@xmath85 , puo@xmath85 , and pro@xmath85 with this set of parameters by numerical diagonalization of the complete @xmath2 configuration hamiltonian ( table  [ tab : table3 ] ) .",
    "moreover , as a further test , we have calculated the magnetic susceptibility for amo@xmath85 and cfo@xmath85 with the same parameters ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fig4 ] ; the measurements can be found in ref .   and ref .",
    "respectively ) .    in all the cases examined so far ,",
    "the comparison with experimental results is quite good , considering that a @xmath110 exact scaling of the cf potential is not expected to hold .",
    "therefore , our results point towards a coherent unified picture for the cf potential in actinide dioxides .",
    "the splitting predicted for pro@xmath4 seems less satisfactory as the measured value of the gap @xmath111 mev is quite larger than the value calculated with the solution we propose .",
    "however , the pro@xmath4 case is complicated by magnetoelastic interactions that are known to affect heavily the physics of this compound by increasing the bare value of the cf gap.@xcite hence , a value of this bare gap of the order of 80 mev is fully realistic .",
    "one feature which can not be accounted for by the cf models proposed so far is the temperature - independence of the magnetic susceptibility of puo@xmath85 above 600 k. indeed , it is obvious that if there is a magnetic gap of 123 mev as observed by neutron scattering , when this level becomes thermally populated it will contribute to the susceptibility , no matter the mechanism which generates the splitting ( unless this contribution is accidentally canceled by other contributions ) .",
    "indeed , even a completely different approach based on density - functional - theory calculations can not remove the discrepancy between magnetic susceptibility and neutron scattering experiments.@xcite using the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] as a guide we have been able to find a solution for puo@xmath85 ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) which leads to @xmath114 and a flat @xmath115 curve below 1000 k. for this set the curie contribution of the excited triplet and the off - diagonal van vleck contribution of the @xmath116 pair accidentally combine into an almost @xmath5-independent susceptibility .",
    "however , this solution is quite unstable even for small variation of the cf parameters ; moreover , it does not give good results if applied to uo@xmath85 and npo@xmath85 .",
    "we have developed a perturbative approach to @xmath0 mixing which allows the stevens formalism to be recovered by replacing the original cf hamiltonian with an effective one operating within the same @xmath0 multiplet .",
    "we have applied the method to the study of the cf in actinide dioxides .",
    "these compounds have extremely interesting physical properties , which are determined by the cf to a large extent .",
    "it is therefore important to reach a precise understanding of the cf , which is the basic building block of all theoretical efforts devoted to understand these properties .",
    "most studies of the cf potential rely on the stevens approach , which yields a solution working fairly consistently over several compounds . yet",
    ", this solution does not work satisfactorily anymore when @xmath0 mixing is included , and the practical impossibility to perform exact @xmath0 mixing calculations in wide ranges of the parameter space has prevented so far the identification of a better alternative . by hugely decreasing the numerical effort in favor of analytical calculations , our method has allowed us to find a @xmath0 mixing solution ( @xmath117 , @xmath109 ) which works consistently over all the considered compounds .",
    "although in the present paper we have only studied cubic systems and included the two lowest multiplets only ( which in dioxides account for almost 100% of @xmath0 mixing ) , the method can be used for any point symmetry , at the price of additional terms in the effective hamiltonian ; also , as many multiplets as necessary can be included in the calculation , leading to additional contributions to the @xmath118 coefficients of eq .",
    "( [ coefficient ] ) . even in this case",
    "our method , by allowing to perform a quantitative analysis of experimental data by means of a stevens - like hamiltonian containing higher - rank operators , is much more efficient than fully numerical diagonalization .",
    "in particular , wide ranges of the parameter space can be easily investigated , allowing to produce quite easily diagrams such as figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and  [ fig : fig3 ] which would otherwise be very hard ( if not impossible , in some cases ) to obtain .",
    "this appendix will be devoted to illustrate the results of analytical diagonalization of the cubic crystal - field hamiltonian @xmath119 which corresponds to @xmath62 discussed in this paper [ eqs .",
