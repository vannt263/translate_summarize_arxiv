    "these movements can be described by system of equations @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 equal time , @xmath2 is the growing rate ( drift ) , @xmath3 is a volatility rate and @xmath4 represent the standard brownian motion . in the above process for the exact moment @xmath5 , the probability density function of finding the randomly moving particle at the point @xmath6 ( price logarithm ) is given as the gaussian function @xmath7 because the time evolution of the logarithm of stock price is described by a winer process , its current price @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the stock price in the @xmath11 moment .",
    "assuming that we are dealing with effective market and is no possibility of arbitrage , and assuming that the parameters are fixed in this model , the necessary estimators of these parameters we can be found by econometric methods .",
    "the mean value of the stock price at the moment @xmath1 must equal @xmath10 and the riskless interest rate @xmath12 is constant in the period @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "so , if accepting the continuous capitalization , we get @xmath14 hence @xmath15 substituting ( [ mu ] ) to ( [ f ] ) we are get distribution of the logarithm of stock price @xmath16 the above distribution is called the distribution of the wiener - bachelier .",
    "the function ( [ fwb ] ) fulfills a diffusion equation with an arbitrage forbidding drift .",
