    "the accumulation of mutations is important not only for cancer initiation , progression , and metastasis , but also for the emergence of acquired resistance against chemotherapeutics , radiation therapy , or targeted drugs .",
    "for this reason there is a large and growing literature on the waiting time @xmath3 until some cell has acquired @xmath4 prespecified mutations . in all the models we consider , type @xmath5 individuals mutate to type @xmath6 at rate @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamics considered have most often been studied in multi - type moran models with a homogeneously mixing population of constant size . here",
    "we will concentrate on how results change when one considers a spatial moran models , and as is the case for much earlier work we will concentrate on the behavior of @xmath8 .",
    "we suppose that cells of type 0 and type 1 have relative fitness 1 and @xmath9 .",
    "since we will only consider the waiting time for the first type 2 , the relative fitness of type 2 s is not important . in this work we will consider situation in which @xmath9 is so close to 1 that the mutations are essentially neutral .",
    "for cancer applications , this is a restrictive assumption , and it will be removed in the companion paper ( part ii ) by durrett , foo and leder @xcite .",
    "however , the current result applies to the important case of tumor suppressor genes . in that case , when both copies of the gene are inactivated trouble develops , but while there is one working copy the cell can function normally .",
    "we begin by recalling results for the moran model in a homogeneously mixing population of size @xmath10 . here and in",

    "the next result made its first appearance on page  16,230 of nowak et al .",
    "since then it has appeared in print a number of times : @xcite , and in nowak s excellent book @xcite on evolutionary dynamics .",

    "the same conclusion holds if @xmath19 .",
    "durrett and schmidt @xcite applied these ideas to study regulatory sequence evolution and to expose flaws in michael behe s arguments for intelligent design .",
    "durrett , schmidt and schweinsberg @xcite , see also schweinsberg @xcite , generalized this result to cover @xmath3 .",

    "suppose first that @xmath15 .",
    "if we start the moran model with @xmath23 type 1 s and the rest type 0 , then the 1 s behave like a critical branching process .",
    "the time needed for the 1 s to die out is @xmath24 and the number of type-1 births before they die out is @xmath25 .",
    "thus we expect the first type 2 to occur in a type-1 family that reaches size @xmath26 , and hence has @xmath27 births . the condition @xmath28 in ( 1 ) guarantees @xmath29 .    since the voter model is a martingale , the probability a type-1 mutation creates a family that reaches size @xmath30 is @xmath31 .",
    "more to the point a simple computation ( consider what happens at the first jump ) shows that the probability a type-1 family gives rise to a type 2 before it dies out is @xmath32 .",
    "since mutations to type 1 occur at times of a rate @xmath33 poisson process and with probability @xmath32 give rise to a type 2 , it follows that if @xmath34 is the birth time of the type-1 mutant that first gives rise to a type 2 then @xmath35 to complete the proof we need to show that @xmath36 , and for this we need the condition @xmath37 in ( 1 ) .    by the discussion of ( a1 )",
    ", the first mutation will occur in a family that reaches a size @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath39 , then computations with girsanov s formula show that ( in the limit @xmath40 ) the behavior of the moran model , while it is @xmath38 , is indistinguishable from the case with no drift .",
    "the assumption of a homogeneously mixing cell populations simplifies calculations considerably , but is not realistic for solid tumors .",
    "for this reason , komarova  @xcite considered a spatial model , which is very similar to one introduced much earlier by williams and bjerknes @xcite .",
    "due to work of bramson and griffeath @xcite , the second model is known to probabilists as the biased voter model .    in the usual formulation of the biased voter model , each site on the dimensional integer lattice @xmath41 can be in state 0 or 1 indicating the presence of a cell with relative fitness 1 or @xmath42 .",
    "cells give birth at a rate equal to their fitness , and the offspring replaces a nearest neighbor chosen at random . when @xmath43 this is the voter model which was introduced independently by clifford and sudbury @xcite and holley and liggett @xcite .",
    "for a summary of what is known see liggett @xcite .",
    "in the biased voter model births drive the process . in komarova",

    "this is not exactly true .",
    "however , we are interested in values of @xmath50 where @xmath51 or even less , so we expect the two models to have very similar behavior . in any case , the difference between the two models is much less than their difference from reality , so we will choose to study the biased voter , whose duality with branching coalescing random walk ( to be described below ) gives us a powerful tool for doing computations .",

    "komarova @xcite uses `` dirichlet boundary conditions '' , that is , she assumes her space is an interval with no cells outside , but this is awkward because the set of type-1 cells may reach one end of the interval and then no further changes happen at that end . to avoid this , we will use periodic boundary conditions , that is , we consider @xmath53 .",
    "the resulting toroidal geometry is a little strange for studying cancer .",
    "however , using @xmath54 has the advantage that the space looks the same seen from any point .",
    "our results will show that for the parameter values the first type 2 will arise when the radius of the set of sites occupied by 1 s is @xmath55 so the boundary conditions do not matter .",
    "let @xmath56 be the set of cells equal to 1 in the voter model with no mutations from 0 to 1 on @xmath41 starting from a single type 1 at 0 .",
    "let @xmath57 be the number of cells in @xmath56 , and let @xmath58 this quantity , which is defined for the voter model without mutation , calculates the probability , which depends on the dimension @xmath0 , that a mutation to type 1 gives rise to a type 2 before its family dies out . to see why this is true note that the integral @xmath59 gives the total number of man - hours in the type-1 family , and conditional on this the number of mutations that will occur is poisson with mean @xmath60 .",
