    "networks of coupled oscillators have been extensively studied for many years , owing to their wide applicability in physics , chemistry , and biology . as examples we mention laser arrays , josephson junctions , populations of fireflies , etc . @xcite .",
    "the phase - only models have proved to provide useful models for systems with weak coupling .",
    "the best known model of this type is the kuramoto model in which the oscillators are described by phase variables @xmath0 and coupled to others through a sinusoidal function @xcite .",
    "these models exhibit a transition to collective synchronization as the coupling strength increases , a process that has been described as a phase transition .",
    "a general form of these systems is as follows : @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the natural frequency of oscillator @xmath3 , @xmath4 represents the coupling between oscillators @xmath3 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a phase lag and @xmath7 is the overall coupling strength .",
    "a general treatment of this system is not easy , and two types of simplifications are commonly used .",
    "one of them is to assume global coupling among the oscillators , and assign the natural frequencies @xmath2 randomly and independently from some prespecified distribution @xcite .",
    "the second tractable case arises when all the oscillators are assumed to be identical , and the coupling @xmath4 is taken to be local , eg .",
    ", nearest - neighbor coupling @xcite .",
    "the intermediate case of nonlocal coupling is harder but the phenomena described by the resulting model are much richer .    in this paper we suppose that the oscillators are arranged on a ring . in the continuum limit @xmath8 the system is described by the nonlocal equation @xmath9\\,dy\\label{phase_eq}\\ ] ] for the phase distribution @xmath10 .",
    "when the oscillators are identical ( @xmath11 is a constant ) and @xmath12 this system admits a new type of state in which a fraction of the oscillators oscillate coherently ( i.e. , in phase ) while the phases of the remaining oscillators remain incoherent @xcite . in this paper",
    "we think of this state , nowadays called a _ chimera _ state @xcite , as a localized structure embedded in a `` turbulent '' background .",
    "subsequent studies of this unexpected state with different coupling functions @xmath13 have identified a variety of different one - cluster and multi - cluster chimera states @xcite , consisting of clusters or groups of adjacent oscillators oscillating in phase with a common frequency .",
    "the clusters are almost stationary in space , although their position ( and width ) fluctuates under the influence of the incoherent oscillators on either side .",
    "recently , a new type of chimera state has been discovered , a traveling chimera state @xcite . in this state",
    "the leading edge plays the role of a synchronization front , which kicks oscillators into synchrony with the oscillators behind it , while the trailing front kicks oscillators out of synchrony ; these two fronts travel with the same speed , forming a bound state .",
    "it is natural to ask whether these states persist in the presence of spatial inhomogeneity , in particular , in the presence of spatial inhomogeneity in the natural frequency distribution ( @xmath14 ) . in @xcite",
    "laing demonstrated the robustness of the chimera state with respect to inhomogeneity in a two population model , which can be considered to be the simplest model exhibiting chimera states @xcite .",
    "however , in this model there is no spatial structure to either population .",
    "consequently , we focus in this paper on a ring of adjacent oscillators with a prescribed but nonuniform frequency distribution @xmath15 , where the continuous variable @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) represents position along the ring . to be specific , two classes of inhomogeneity are considered , a bump inhomogeneity @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and a periodic inhomogeneity @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a positive integer .",

    "these choices are motivated by biological systems in which coupling between nearby oscillators is often attractive while that between distant oscillators may be repelling @xcite .",
    "there are several advantages to the use of these two types of coupling .",
    "the first is that these couplings allow us to obtain chimera states with random initial conditions .",
    "the second is that we can identify a large variety of new states for suitable parameter values , including ( a ) splay states , ( b ) stationary multi - cluster states with evenly distributed coherent clusters , ( c ) stationary multi - cluster states with unevenly distributed clusters , ( d ) a fully coherent state traveling with a constant speed , and ( e ) a single cluster traveling chimera state @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the effect of the two types of inhomogeneity in @xmath11 on each of these states and describe the results in terms of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 or @xmath21 describing the strength and length scale of the inhomogeneity , while varying the parameter @xmath26 representing the phase lag @xmath6 . in section [ eff_eq ] ,",
