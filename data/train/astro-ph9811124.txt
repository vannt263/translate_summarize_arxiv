    "empirical physical relations in elliptical galaxies , such as the fundamental plane ( fp ) and the color - magnitude ( cm ) relation , are generally considered to provide strong constraints on the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies , such as the formation epoch , the star formation histories , and the merging histories ( faber 1973 ; visvanathan & sandage 1977 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al . 1987 ; bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; arag@xmath23n - salamanca et al .",
    "1993 ; djorgovski , pahre , & de carvalho 1996 ; franx & van dokkum 1996 ) .",
    "physical origins of these relations accordingly have been extensively explored by observational and theoretical studies from variously different points of views ( e.g. , arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; bender , burstein , & faber 1992 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "1996 ; kauffmann & charlot 1997 ) . among possibly key determinants for the origins ,",
    "the nature of stellar populations of ellipticals , such as age and metallicity distribution , is recognized as a primarily important factor , principally because stellar populations are generally considered to affect both the slope and tightness of these empirical relations .",
    "origins of such important nature of stellar populations in elliptical galaxies have been indeed investigated mostly in the context of monolithic collapse model with the so - called galactic wind ( larson 1975 ; carlberg 1984 ; arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; bressan et al .",
    "1996 , gibson and matteucci 1997 ) , they have not been so extensively explored , however , in the context of the merger scenario that ellipticals are formed by major disk - disk galaxy mergers ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 ) . accordingly",
    ", it is vital to investigate whether or not the merger scenario , which has been already confirmed to have @xmath24 advantages in reproducing a number of important structural and kinematical properties of ellipticals ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1992 ) , can also reproduce fundamental properties of stellar populations inferred from empirical relations of elliptical galaxies .",
    "there are only a few studies trying to clarify the origin of stellar populations of elliptical galaxies along the merger scenario .",
    "schweizer & seitzer ( 1992 ) demonstrated that the bluer integrated @xmath25 color of elliptical galaxies with morphologically fine structure can be explained by the secondary starburst induced by major disk - disk galaxy mergers .",
    "fritze -v .",
    "alvensleben & gerhard ( 1994 ) showed that even late galaxy mergers with their age @xmath2 12 gyr can develop typical colors of ellipticals within 3 @xmath2 4 gyr after the secondary starburst .",
    "kauffmann & charlot ( 1997 ) constructed a semi - analytic model of elliptical galaxy formation , which is based upon the hierarchical clustering in cdm universe and includes rather simple chemical enrichment process , and thereby demonstrated that the origin of the color - magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies can be reproduced successfully in the cdm model of galaxy formation .",
    "these previous studies , which are based on @xmath26-@xmath27 chemical evolution models , have completely neglected the importance of dynamical effects on chemophotometric evolution of galaxy mergers .",
    "since star formation history , which is one of the most critical determinants for fundamental properties of stellar populations , is considered to depend largely on galactic dynamics in various ways ( e.g. , kennicutt 1989 ; larson 1992 ) , we should investigate dynamical effects on stellar populations of galaxies in an admittedly self - consistent manner , in order to understand more deeply and thoroughly the nature of stellar populations of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate how dynamical effects of galaxy merging , in particular , violent relaxation combined with gaseous dissipation , affect global properties of stellar populations ( e.g. mean stellar metallicity and age ) and their radial gradients .",
    "the present study is an extended version of our previous study ( bekki & shioya 1998 , hereafter referred to as paper i ) , which is the first step toward the understanding of a close physical relationship between dynamical evolution and chemical one in high redshift galaxy mergers ( the redshift of @xmath28 ) between disk galaxies with the gas mass fraction larger than 0.2 that is a typical value of the present late - type spirals .",
    "the importance of investigating high redshift gas - rich galaxy mergers is described in paper i. the present chemodynamical model is more realistic and sophisticated than our previous one in the following three points : ( 1 ) instead of using instantaneous chemical mixing approximation , we consider time - delay between star formation and metal ejection mainly from type ia and ii supernovae .",
    "( 2 ) feedback effects of type ia and ii supernovae on dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxy mergers are incorporated .",
    "( 3 ) time - evolution of enrichment processes is solved for each of chemical components , h , he , mg , o , and fe .",
    "this chemodynamical model enables us to reveal not only physical origins of global ( mean ) properties of stellar populations , which are the key determinants for galactic empirical physical relations , but also radial gradients of stellar populations in elliptical galaxies . by using the present chemodynamical model",
    ", we particularly investigate the origin of @xmath29-@xmath30 chemical , photometric , and spectroscopic properties observed in elliptical galaxies .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows . in  2 , we summarize numerical models used in the present study and describe methods for analyzing the stellar populations produced by dissipative galaxy mergers with star formation . in  3 ,",
    "we demonstrate how a number of fundamental characteristics of stellar populations in merger remnants depend on galactic mass . in  4 , we provide a number of implications on the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies , based on the derived results .",
    "the conclusions of the present study are given in  5 .",
    "chemical , photometric , and spectroscopic evolution of galaxies are basically determined by age and metallicity distribution of stellar populations within galaxies .",
    "fundamental properties of the distribution are furthermore controlled by star formation histories , which are considered to depend strongly on dynamical and kinematical properties of galaxies such as local dynamical instability ( e.g. kennicutt 1989 ; larson 1992 ) .",
    "hence we numerically solve the time evolution of chemical , photometric , and spectroscopic evolution of galaxy mergers , based on the dynamical evolution of galaxies .",
    "firstly we describe a numerical model for dynamical evolution of galaxy mergers , including structure and kinematics of merger progenitor disks , initial orbital configurations of galaxy mergers , and the prescriptions of dissipative process (  2.1 ) .",
    "secondly , we describe a star formation model , in which gas consumption rate of star formation and the effectiveness of type ia and ii supernovae feedback are given in detail (  2.2 ) .",
    "thirdly we give the method for analyzing the chemical enrichment process during dissipative galaxy merging with star formation and the photometric properties of merger remnants (  2.3 ) .",
    "lastly , we describe the main points of analysis of the present study (  2.4 ) .",
    "we construct models of galaxy mergers between gas - rich disk galaxies with equal mass by using fall - efstathiou model ( 1980 ) .",
    "the total mass and the size of a progenitor disk are @xmath0 and @xmath31 , respectively . from now on , all the mass and length are measured in units of @xmath0 and @xmath31 , respectively , unless specified .",
    "velocity and time are measured in units of @xmath32 = @xmath33 and @xmath34 = @xmath35 , respectively , where @xmath36 is the gravitational constant and assumed to be 1.0 .",
    "dimensional values for these units in each model are given later .",
    "in the present model , the rotation curve becomes nearly flat at 0.35 @xmath31 with the maximum rotational velocity @xmath37 = 1.8 .",
    "the corresponding total mass @xmath38 and halo mass @xmath39 are 3.8 and 2.8 in our units , respectively .",
    "the radial ( @xmath40 ) and vertical ( @xmath1 ) density profile of a disk are assumed to be proportional to @xmath41 with scale length @xmath42 = 0.2 and to @xmath43 with scale length @xmath44 = 0.04 in our units , respectively .",
    "the cut off radius for mass density of the halo component is 1.2 in our units .",
    "velocity dispersion of the halo component at a given point is set to be isotropic and given according to the virial theorem .",
    "in addition to the rotational velocity made by the gravitational field of disk and halo component , the initial radial and azimuthal velocity dispersion are given to disk component according to the epicyclic theory with toomre s parameter ( @xcite ) @xmath45 = 1.0 .",
    "this adopted value for @xmath45 parameter is appreciably smaller compared with the value required for stabilizing the initial disk against the non - axisymmetric dynamical instability ( e.g. bar instability ) .",
    "the reason for this adoption is that the initial disk is assumed to be composed mostly of interstellar gas and thus random kinetic energy in the disk is considered to be rather smaller because of gaseous dissipation in the disk . the vertical velocity dispersion at given radius",
    "is set to be 0.5 times as large as the radial velocity dispersion at that point , as is consistent with the observed trend of the milky way ( e.g. , wielen 1977 ) .",
    "the collisional and dissipative nature of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is modeled by the sticky particle method ( @xcite ) .",
    "it should be emphasized here that this discrete cloud model can at best represent the @xmath46 interstellar medium of galaxies in a schematic way .",
    "actually , considerably complicated nature of interstellar medium , which can be modeled as three phase structure ( ` hot ' , ` warm ' , and ` cool ' gas ) by mckee & ostriker ( 1977 ) , would not be so simply modeled by the ` sticky particle ' method in which gaseous dissipation is modeled by ad hoc cloud - cloud collision : any existing numerical method could not model the @xmath46 interstellar medium in an admittedly proper way .",
    "more elaborated numerical modeling for real interstellar medium would be necessary for our further understanding of dynamical evolution in dissipative galaxy mergers . to mimic the galaxy mergers which are occurred at high redshift and",
    "thus very dissipative because of a considerably larger amount of interstellar gas in the progenitor disks , we assume that the fraction of gas mass in a disk is set to be 1.0 initially .",
    "the size of the clouds is set to be 5.0 @xmath47 @xmath48 in our units unless specified .",
    "the radial and tangential restitution coefficient for cloud - cloud collisions are set to be 0.5 and 0.0 , respectively .      in all of the merger simulations , the orbit of the two disks",
    "is set to be initially in the @xmath49 plane .",
    "the initial distance between the center of mass of the two disks , the pericenter distance , and the eccentricity of the merger orbit are 4.0 , 1.0 , and 1.0 , respectively , for all models .",
    "the spin of each galaxy in a merger is specified by two angle @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where suffix @xmath52 is used to identify each galaxy .",
    "@xmath50 is the angle between the @xmath53 axis and the vector of the angular momentum of a disk .",
    "@xmath51 is the azimuthal angle measured from @xmath54 axis to the projection of the angular momentum vector of a disk on to @xmath49 plane .",
    "@xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are set to be 30.0 , 120.0 , 90.0 , and 0.0 , respectively .",
    "the time when the progenitor disks merge completely and reach the dynamical equilibrium is less than 15.0 in our units for most of models and does not depend so strongly on the history of star formation in the present calculations . in the present study",
    ", we do not describe the results of models other than those given above , principally because diversity in initial orbital conditions of galaxy merging only introduce a scatter in the present numerical results and does not drastically change the @xmath59 of the derived results , as has been already pointed out by paper i. furthermore we do not here intend to investigate the importance of multiple galaxy merging in the chemodynamical evolution of elliptical galaxies , which has been already investigated in paper i.      initial conditions of galaxy mergers adopted in the present study differ from those adopted in previous studies ( e.g. , mihos & hernquist 1996 ) mainly in the following two points .",
    "firstly , as is described in  2.1.1 , the present initial disk model does not include any remarkable bulge components , and accordingly corresponds to ` pure ' late - type spiral .",
    "the reasons for this are firstly that by not including bulges , we can more clearly elucidate the dynamical effects of dissipative galaxy merging on chemical evolution of galaxies ( that is , we can discriminate the effects of galaxy merging and those of galactic bulges ) , and secondly that extensive observational studies have not been yet accumulated which can give strong constraints on physical properties of galactic bulges in high redshift disks adopted in the present study .",
    "although it is highly possible that galactic bulges greatly affect the chemical evolution of galaxy mergers , we investigate this issue in our future papers .",
    "secondly , gas mass fraction adopted in the present study ( 1.0 ) is much larger that that of the observed typical values of the present disks ( @xmath60 , adopted in previous studies ) .",
    "this is firstly because we now consider chemodynamical evolution of gas - rich mergers at high redshift , and secondly because we generally must begin with purely gaseous galactic disks for solving chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "the main reason for our adoption of high redshift mergers is that the observed considerably tight color - magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) and the relatively smaller redshift evolution of photometric properties of elliptical galaxies ( arag@xmath23n - salamanca et al . 1993 ; franx & van dokkum 1996 ) imply relatively early formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "actually , the gas mass fraction in precursor disks of a merger is different between galaxy mergers and depends on the epoch of the merging . although this difference could yield a great variety of chemical and dynamical structures in merger remnants",
    ", we do not intend to consider this important difference for simplicity in the present paper and will address this in our future papers .",
    "furthermore we should emphasize here the following three less realistic assumptions or oversimplifications on initial conditions of galaxy mergers adopted in the present study .",
    "firstly , in order to elucidate more clearly dynamical effects on chemophotometric evolution of galaxy mergers , we assume @xmath61 @xmath62 gas - rich exponential disks ( ` mature ' disks ) in investigating high redshift galaxy mergers .",
    "it is , however , not observationally clarified whether or not high redshift disk galaxies are so fully developed ( ` mature ' ) as is assumed in the present study .",
    "accordingly , the adopted assumption of ` mature ' disks could correspond to oversimplification .",
    "secondly , we neglect the importance of continuous gaseous infall onto galactic disks from external environments in the evolution of disk galaxies , which is expected from observational studies on the g - dwarf problem in the galaxy ( e.g. , van den bergh 1962 ) and star formation history of galaxies ( e.g. , larson 1972 ; larson , tinsley , & caldwell 1980 ; kennicutt 1983 ; sandage 1986 ) . owing to this neglect of gaseous infall for merger progenitor disks ,",
    "the present chemodynamical model suffers from overproduction of metal - poor stars in merger remnants , as is pointed out by other chemical evolution models ( e.g. , tantalo et al .",
    "thirdly , we assume that two disks merge with each other to form an elliptical when the disks still have a larger gas mass fraction ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "owing to this assumption , the dynamical effects of galaxy merging on ism and thus on chemical evolution of ism is more drastic in the present chemodynamical model .",
    "actually , the epoch of major galaxy merging is probably widely spread , depending on orbit configurations of galaxy merging ( impact parameters ) and galaxy environments .",
    "accordingly , it is equally possible that in gas - poor galaxy mergers ( late mergers ) , galaxy merging does not induce the secondary starburst strongly enough to change substantially stellar populations of galaxy mergers .",
    "because of these three apparently less realistic assumptions , we should interpret more carefully the present numerical results and consider the applicability of the results to real elliptical galaxies .",
    "these assumptions indeed may weakens the validity of the present chemodynamical model , however , we believe that even the present model enables us to grasp @xmath24 essential ingredients of dynamical effects on chemophotometric evolution of galaxy mergers",
    ". our future studies , which do not adopt the above three less realistic assumptions and instead include more realistic initial conditions of galaxy mergers within a plausible cosmological model , will help us to understand more deeply and thoroughly galactic chemophotometric evolution affected largely by dynamical evolution of galaxy mergers .",
    "gas consumption by star formation in galaxy mergers is modeled by converting the collisional gas particles into collisionless new stellar ones according to the algorithm of star formation described below .",
    "we adopt the schmidt law ( schmidt 1959 ) with exponent @xmath64 = 2.0 ( 1.0 @xmath65 @xmath64 @xmath65 2.0 , @xcite ) as the controlling parameter of the rate of star formation . the amount of gas consumed by star formation for each gas particle in @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 , @xmath69 , is given as : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the gas density around each gas particle and the mean gas density at 0.48 @xmath31 of an initial disk , respectively .",
    "this star formation model is similar to that of mihos , richstone , & bothun ( 1992 ) . in order to avoid a large number of new stellar particles with different mass , we convert one gas particle into one stellar one according to the following procedure .",
    "first we give each gas particle the probability , @xmath73 , that the gas particle is converted into stellar one , by setting the @xmath73 to be proportional to the @xmath69 in equation ( 1 ) estimated for the gas particle .",
    "then we draw the random number to determine whether or not the gas particle is totally converted into one new star .",
    "this method of star formation enables us to control the rapidity of star formation without increase of particle number in each simulation thus to maintain the numerical accuracy in each simulation .",
    "the @xmath74 is meant to be proportional to the ratio of dynamical time - scale of the system to the time - scale of gas consumption by star formation .",
    "we accordingly emphasize that even if the coefficient of the schmidt law is constant for galaxies , values of @xmath74 can be different between galaxies owing to the difference in dynamical time - scale between galaxies .",
    "the @xmath74 is considered to depend exclusively on galactic disk mass ( @xmath0 ) , as is described later .",
    "the equation ( 1 ) furthermore states that a larger number of stellar particles are created at the regions where the local gas density becomes larger owing to the onset of local jeans instability .",
    "the positions and velocity of the new stellar particles are set to be the same as those of original gas particles .      thermal and dynamical ( kinematic ) heating of ism driven by supernovae",
    "are found to affect greatly the formation and evolution of galaxies ( e.g. , katz 1992 ; navarro & white 1993 ) .",
    "we here consider the dynamical feedback effects of type ia ( snia ) and type ii supernovae ( snii ) and neglect the feedback effects of thermal heating on galaxy evolution .",
    "the reason for this neglect is firstly that our gaseous model does not solve thermal evolution of ism , and secondly that such thermal effects is found to be less important than dynamical feedback effects owing to efficient cooling of ism ( e.g. , katz 1992 ; navarro & white 1993 ) .",
    "accordingly some fraction of total energy ejected from snia and snii is assumed to give velocity perturbation of ism in the present study .",
    "the details of the supernovae feedback effects are given as follows .",
    "total energy produced by snia and snii at the time @xmath75 for each @xmath52th newly born stellar particle ( @xmath76 ) is given as , @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the mass of the @xmath52th stellar particle , @xmath79 is the total energy of sni and sniia per unit mass at the time @xmath75 , and @xmath80 represents the time when the @xmath52th stellar particle is born from a gas particle .",
    "the above formalism is more elaborated than previous studies in the following two points .",
    "firstly , we consider time - delay between the epoch of star formation and the epoch of supernovae explosions for stars with variously different masses . in general ,",
    "life - time of stars depends on stellar mass in such a way that more massive stars die earlier than less massive ones .",
    "consequently , the time - delay is different between stars with different masses and total number of snia and snii is also time - dependent . since each @xmath52th stellar particle ( @xmath81 in the present study )",
    "is assumed to consist of stars with different masses , the @xmath79 is time - dependent .",
    "secondly , we consider that both the energy ejected from snia and that from snii can be returned to ism of galaxy mergers but neglect thermal energy ejected from long - lived evolved stars .",
    "the total energy per a supernovae is assumed to be @xmath82erg both for snia and snii .",
    "the typical epoch of supernovae explosions are different between these two types of supernovae ( @xmath83 yr for snia and @xmath84 yr for snii ) , and this difference is reflected on the time - dependence of the @xmath79 .",
    "some fraction of the @xmath76 are assumed to be returned to gas particles ( ism ) and then to change kinetic energy of gas particles surrounding @xmath52th stellar particle .",
    "each @xmath85th gas particle around @xmath52th stellar particle can receive a velocity perturbation ( @xmath86 ) directed radially away from the @xmath52th stellar particle .",
    "the @xmath86 at the time @xmath75 satisfies the following relation : @xmath87 where @xmath88 represents the fraction of supernovae energy returned to ism , @xmath89 is total number of gas particles that are located within 0.05 ( in our units ) around @xmath52th stellar particle , and @xmath90 is a mass of each @xmath85th gas particle .",
    "this formulation is similar to that adopted in navarro & white ( 1993 ) .",
    "it depends largely on the parameter @xmath88 how greatly snia and snii can provide dynamical ( kinetic ) feedback effects on ism of galaxy mergers .",
    "it is , however , not observationally clarified which values of @xmath88 is the most plausible and realistic for the evolution of ism affected by snia and ii feedback .",
    "thus we investigate the importance of the parameter @xmath88 by varying values of @xmath88 ( @xmath91 in the present study ) .",
    "all the calculations related to the above dynamical evolution including the dissipative dynamics , star formation , snia and snii feedback effects , and gravitational interaction between collisionless and collisional component have been carried out on the grape board ( @xcite ) at astronomical institute of tohoku university .",
    "the number of particles for a galaxy merger model is 10000 for the halo component and 20000 for the gaseous component .",
    "the parameter of gravitational softening is set to be fixed at 0.04 in all the simulations .",
    "the time integration of the equation of motion is performed by using 2-order leap - flog method .",
    "energy and angular momentum are conserved within 1 percent accuracy in a test collisionless merger simulation .",
    "most of the calculations are set to be stopped at t = 20.0 in our units unless specified .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic properties such as global colors and metallicity gradient in elliptical galaxies depend critically on how the metallicity and age of stellar components are distributed in galaxies .",
    "accordingly , we must analyze the distribution of stellar age and that of stellar metallicity in merger remnants for each model in order to grasp some fundamental characteristics of chemical , photometric , and spectroscopic properties in merger remnants .",
    "we calculate age and metallicity distribution , based on the age ( @xmath80 ) and metallicity ( @xmath92 ) assigned to each @xmath52th stellar particle , as described in detail later .",
    "the outline for this calculation is as follows .",
    "first we derive the distribution of stellar age and that of stellar metallicity by assigning age and metallicity to stellar particles according as the law of chemical enrichment applied to this study .",
    "next , by using the stellar population synthesis method , we calculate the photometric and spectroscopic properties based on the derived distribution of age and metallicity in merger remnants .",
    "chemical enrichment through star formation during galaxy merging is considered to proceed locally and inhomogeneously . in the present study , we investigate time - evolution of five species of chemical components , h , he , o , mg , and fe as well as the conventionally used mean metallicity @xmath1 .",
    "the mean metallicity of @xmath1 for each @xmath52th stellar particle is represented by @xmath92 .",
    "total mass of each @xmath85th ( @xmath85=1,2,3,4,and 5 ) chemical component ( h , he , o , mg , and fe ) ejected from each @xmath52th stellar particle at the time @xmath75 is given as , @xmath93 where @xmath78 is the mass of the @xmath52th stellar particle , @xmath94 is the mass of each @xmath85th chemical component ejected from stars per unit mass at the time @xmath75 , and @xmath80 represents the time when the @xmath52th stellar particle is born from a gas particle .",
    "the @xmath95 is given to neighbor gas particles locating within @xmath96 from the position of the @xmath52th stellar particle .",
    "this @xmath96 is referred to as chemical mixing length in the present paper , and represents the region within which the neighbor gas particles are polluted by metals ejected from stellar particles",
    ". the value of @xmath96 relative to the typical size of a galaxy could be different between galaxies , accordingly the value of @xmath96 is considered to be a free parameter in the present study .",
    "the value of @xmath96 examined the most extensively in the present study is 0.1 , which corresponds to the half of the scale - length of initial disks .",
    "initial gaseous metallicity ( @xmath1 ) is set to be 0.1 solar , which is exactly the same as that of infall gas adopted in the chemical evolution of disk galaxies with gaseous infall ( e.g. , matteucci & franois 1989 ) .",
    "we adopt this initial enrichment of ism in disks in order to avoid overproduction of less metal - enriched stellar components that are not allowed for plausible chemical evolution of disk galaxies ( e.g. , van den bergh 1962 ) .",
    "initial value of the abundance ratio [ mg / fe ] for ism in disks is set to be 0.8 , which is similar to a typical value of metal - poor halo ism that is metal - enriched mostly by snii and a candidate for infall gas of disk galaxies ( e.g. , matteucci & franois 1989 ) .",
    "since we now consider the time - delay between the epoch of star formation and that of supernovae explosions , the mass of each @xmath85th chemical component ejected from each @xmath52th stellar particle , which are basically determined by @xmath94 , is also strongly time - dependent .",
    "we estimate the mass - dependent life - time of stars that becomes snia or snii by using mass - age relation given by bressan et al .",
    "the fraction of close binary stars of snia relative to snii ( represented by @xmath97 parameter in matteucci & tornamb 1987 ) is assumed to be 0.1 .",
    "the @xmath94 furthermore depends on stellar yields , imf profiles , upper cutoff mass @xmath98 , and lower one @xmath99 . in the present study",
    ", we adopt the salpeter imf , @xmath100 , with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the reason for this larger @xmath99 ( = @xmath103 ) is essentially because we do not have stellar yield tables for stars with masses less than 0.6 . to calculate the ejected mass of gas and metals in @xmath94 , we use stellar yields derived by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) for snii , nomoto , thielemann , & yokoi ( 1984 ) for snia , and bressan et al .",

    "more details of the time - dependence of @xmath94 for a given imf , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 are given in appendix a.      it is assumed in the present study that the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a model galaxy is a sum of the sed of stellar particles .",
    "the sed of each @xmath52th stellar particle is assumed to be a simple stellar population ( ssp ) that is a coeval and chemically homogeneous assembly of stars .",
    "thus the monochromatic flux of a galaxy with age @xmath75 , @xmath104 , is described as ; @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath78 are a monochromatic flux of ssp of age @xmath107 and metallicity @xmath92 , where suffix @xmath52 identifies each @xmath52th stellar particle , and mass of each stellar particle , respectively .",
    "the age of ssp , @xmath107 , is defined as @xmath108 , where @xmath80 is the time when a gas particle is converted into a stellar one .",
    "the metallicity of ssp is exactly the same as that of the stellar particle , @xmath92 , and the summation ( @xmath109 ) in equation ( 5 ) is done for all stellar particles in a model galaxy .",
    "a stellar particle is assumed to be composed of stars whose age and metallicity are exactly the same as those of the stellar particle and the total mass of the stars is set to be the same as that of the stellar particle .",
    "thus the monochromatic flux of ssp at a given wavelength is defined as @xmath110 where @xmath18 is mass of a star , @xmath111 is a monochromatic flux of a star with mass @xmath18 , metallicity @xmath92 and age @xmath107 , and @xmath112 is a initial mass function ( imf ) of stars . in this paper",
    ", we use the @xmath113 of gissel96 which is a latest version of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",

    "consequently , a more massive galaxy merger has larger mean stellar metallicity , as is shown in figure 1 .",
    "this dependence of mean stellar metallicity on galactic mass is consistent with that derived in our paper i. figure 2 describes final metallicity distributions of stellar components ( @xmath152 ) in merger remnants for model 1 with @xmath126 and model 2 with @xmath151 .",

    "as is shown in figure 3 , both @xmath153 and @xmath154 are finally discernibly larger for a more massive merger .",
    "this is essentially because for the massive galaxy merger , owing to less effective supernova feedback , a larger amount of ism can be converted into stellar components during dissipative galaxy merging and thus more metal - enriched with mg and fe",

    "the present merger model demonstrates that chemical evolution of ism in galaxy merges proceeds in an very inhomogeneous way : in the central part of mergers , metal - enrichment is more efficient owing to radial inflow of metal - enriched ism and the subsequent star formation triggered by dissipative galaxy merging , whereas in the outer part , metal - enrichment is less efficient owing to a larger amount of metal - enriched ism tidally stripped away from mergers . as a natural result of this inhomogeneous chemical mixing in dissipative galaxy merging ,",
    "both stellar and gaseous components have a number of interesting chemical ( and spectrophotometric ) properties in merger remnants . among these ,",
    "we here restrict ourselves to radial properties of stellar populations , and accordingly other important roles of inhomogeneous chemical mixing in determining fundamental properties of elliptical galaxies are described in  4.2 .",
    "figure 4 describes radial distribution of stellar metallicity ( @xmath139 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 ) and that of the abundance ratio of [ mg / fe ] in merger remnants for model 1 with @xmath126 and model 2 with @xmath151 .",
    "irrespectively of galactic mass , merger remnants show @xmath155 metallicity gradients fitted well by power - low profile ( especially for the region @xmath156 ) .",

    "the derived dependence of stellar metallicity gradients on galactic mass is considerably different from that described in our paper i , in which supernova feedback effects are not included at all .",
    "this difference between the present study and our paper i strongly suggests that supernova feedback effects are critically important for the origin of stellar metallicity gradients of elliptical galaxies .",

    "this result reflects the fact that in the central part of galaxy mergers , more metal - enriched ism that is transferred to galactic nuclei owing to efficient gas fueling in the later stage of galaxy merging can be preferentially and efficiently converted into stellar components within the deeper potential well .",

    "moreover the radial gradients of @xmath12 and @xmath163 are steeper for a more massive merger remnant , which means that a larger amount of metals ejected from snia and snii are transferred to the central part of the remnant owing to more efficient fueling of metal - enriched ism for the more massive galaxy merger .      here in  3.2 , we present dependence of spectrophotometric properties of merger remnants on the parameter @xmath88 .",
    "we compare the results of models with @xmath172 ( no supernova feedback models , model 7 , 8 , and 9 ) with those of models with @xmath88 = 0.1 and 0.5 ( model 1 @xmath2 6 ) and thereby observe how the supernova feedback effects control fundamental characteristics of spectrophotometric properties in merger remnants . in particular , we describe the importance of the supernova feedback effects in the formation of the following three observational spectrophotometric relationships of elliptical galaxies : ( 1 ) the cm relation , ( 2 ) the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation , and ( 3 ) the luminosity - dependence of mass - to - light ratio .",

    "the primary reason for the derived color - magnitude relation of merger remnants is that more massive ( luminous ) galaxy mergers can have larger mean stellar metallicity owing to more efficient star formation and chemical enrichment : the cm relation derived in the present study is due to mass - metallicity relation of merger remnants .",
    "this result implies that the existence of the observed cm relation is not necessarily inconsistent with the merger scenario of elliptical galaxy formation , furthermore that the origin of the observed cm relation can be closely associated with dissipative galaxy merging .",
    "as is observed in figure 8 , the difference of colors between merger remnants with different luminosity can be more discernable in the models with @xmath178 than in the models with @xmath172 ( no feedback ) .",
    "this result suggests that in addition to the rapidity of star formation ( the importance of which is described in the paper i ) , supernova feedback effects play a vital role in reproducing the cm relation of elliptical galaxies .",

    "this result clearly demonstrates that the origin of the observed @xmath12-@xmath173 relation of elliptical galaxies can be due partly to physical processes associated with snia and sn ii events .",
    "the reason for the clearer @xmath12-@xmath173 relation in models with @xmath180 and 0.5 is essentially that for more massive galaxy mergers , a larger amount of more metal - enriched ism can be transferred to the central part of the mergers with deeper potential wells .",

    "these observational and theoretical studies imply that the above failure in the successful reproduction of the @xmath22 band fp does not point out one of serious disadvantages of the present merger model but is on line with the early suggestion that the @xmath22 band fp should be explained by the supposed mass - dependence of structure and kinematics ( not by effects of stellar population ) .",
    "our future extensive dynamical studies of galaxy mergers will provide a plausible answer for the problem of whether or not the structural and kinematical nonhomology in merger remnants can really reproduce the @xmath22 band fp even if stellar populations of galaxy mergers does not contribute at all to the creation of the @xmath22 band fp .      in the preceding sections",

    "i has already pointed out , other merger parameters , such as the mixing length of chemical components and effectiveness of gaseous dissipation during galaxy merging , can greatly determine not only mean properties of stellar populations but also radial ones in merger remnants .",
    "the present study , which is more realistic and elaborated than the paper i , should accordingly confirm the importance of other parameters of galaxy mergers .",
    "figure 11 describes the dependence of the @xmath7 color gradient ( @xmath8 ) on mean stellar metallicity ( @xmath139 ) in merger remnants for six models with @xmath181 and @xmath182 ( model 1 , 2 , 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13 ) .",

    "the importance of chemical mixing length and gaseous dissipation clarified for @xmath139 and @xmath8 can be applied to other mean and radial properties of metals , color , and line indices . as is shown in figure 11 ,",
    "mean stellar metallicity is slightly smaller in the models with larger @xmath96 ( compare , for example , the results of model 1 with those of model 10 . ) , which is consistent with that derived in the paper i. the @xmath7 color gradient is not largely different between models with different @xmath96 for less massive models whereas the gradient is appreciably smaller in mergers with larger @xmath96 for more massive models .",
    "this result implies that inhomogeneous chemical mixing described before (  3.1 ) is critical for the formation of color gradient especially for more massive galaxy mergers .",
    "furthermore , mean stellar metallicity is found to be appreciably smaller for models with no gaseous dissipation ( compare , for example , the results of model 1 with those of model 12 . ) .",
    "this result clearly suggests that total amount of gaseous dissipation during galaxy merging is also important determinant for the mean properties of stellar populations of merger remnants .",
    "figure 11 moreover shows that without gaseous dissipation , the @xmath7 color gradient in merger remnants becomes @xmath171 , which suggests that a sufficiently large amount of gaseous dissipation is indispensable for successful reproduction of the observed negative color gradients of luminous elliptical galaxies .",

    "these results accordingly imply that more careful numerical implementation on chemical mixing and gaseous dissipation in galaxy mergers is required for comparing more quantitatively numerical results with observational ones : the mass - dependent chemical , photometric , and spectroscopic properties of galaxy mergers clarified in the present study ( especially in  3.1 and  3.2 ) can be meaningful only in a qualitative sense .",
    "we have so far restricted ourselves to mass - dependent ( or luminosity - dependent ) chemical , photometric , and spectroscopic properties of elliptical galaxies .",
    "there are , however , a number of observational spectrophotometric properties that correlate not so well with galactic luminosity but strongly with other physical properties in elliptical galaxies .",
    "figure 12 and 13 demonstrate two examples of this type of correlation derived in the present study .",
    "figure 12 shows the dependence of the radial gradient of @xmath12 index ( @xmath183 ) on the central @xmath12 index ( within @xmath179 ) in merger remnants for @xmath184 models in the present study .",
    "we can clearly observe that merger remnant with larger central @xmath12 index has the larger ( negative ) gradient of @xmath12 index .",
    "this result is consistent reasonably well with the recent observational result that the radial gradient of @xmath12 index can correlate with the central @xmath12 index rather than with galactic luminosity or central velocity dispersion ( gonzlez & gorgas 1996 ) .",
    "this result furthermore shows that even if there is a great diversity in parameters associated with physical processes of galaxy merging , the observed relationship between the central @xmath12 index and @xmath165 can be reproduced successfully by galaxy mergers : the origin of @xmath185 relation does not depend on the details of galaxy merging processes .",
    "figure 13 gives the dependence of stellar metallicity gradient ( @xmath186 ) on the radial gradient of the epoch of star formation ( @xmath187 ) in merger remnants for @xmath184 models in the present study .",
    "the radial gradient of @xmath187 corresponds to the age gradient in each merger remnant . as is shown in figure 13 , merger remnants with larger absolute magnitude of their age gradients",
    "have larger metallicity gradients .",
    "this result is consistent with the observational one inferred from the radial gradients of @xmath15 and [ mgfe ] line indices ( e.g. , chiosi 1996 ) .",
    "the physical reason for the derived dependence is that irrespectively of merger parameters , younger stellar population in the central part of galaxy mergers are formed preferentially from more metal - enriched ism transferred from the outer part of mergers owing to the efficient gas fueling .",
    "thus these two results on the @xmath185 relation and @xmath188 one provide clues to the origins of observational results of chiosi ( 1996 ) and gonzlez & gorgas ( 1996 ) , which clearly show @xmath29-@xmath189 properties of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we have demonstrated that spectrophotometric properties of galaxy mergers depend on galactic mass ( or luminosity ) , essentially because galactic mass can greatly affect both the rapidity of star formation and the effectiveness of supernova feedback in chemodynamical evolution of galaxies mergers .",
    "this implies that the origins of the observed fundamental characteristics of spectrophotometric properties of elliptical galaxies can be understood in terms of mass - dependent chemodynamical evolution of galaxy mergers .",
    "here we particularly discuss whether or not the present merger model of elliptical galaxy formation can explain @xmath190 the origins of the following two fundamental empirical relationship between galactic mass ( luminosity ) and spectrophotometric properties in elliptical galaxies : ( 1 ) the cm relation and ( 2 ) the @xmath191 one .",
    "the cm relation is generally considered to be one of important diagnostics which can confirm whether or not a certain model of elliptical galaxy formation is plausible and viable .",
    "the present merger model predicts that more massive ellipticals have larger stellar metallicity thus show redder colors .",
    "the reasons for more efficient metal - enrichment in more massive galaxy mergers are firstly that a smaller amount of metal - enriched ism can be tidally stripped away from galaxy mergers owing to more rapid gas consumption by star formation , secondly that star formation can be less strongly suppressed by supernova feedback thus can produce a larger amount of metals .",
    "these results imply that the origin of the cm relation of elliptical galaxies can be closely associated with mass - dependent chemodynamical evolution of galaxy mergers .",
    "although these results can provide a @xmath174 explanation of the cm relation , the present merger model still seems to have some difficulties in explaining @xmath190 the origin of the absolute magnitude of the cm slope ( see figure 8) . to be more specific , the color difference in @xmath133 between a merger remnant with @xmath192 and that with @xmath193 in @xmath21 band is only 0.45 ( 0.16 ) mag for models with @xmath178 ( 0.1 ) , which seems to disagree with the observed difference of 0.48 for the corresponding luminosity range in bower et al .",
    "since we did not consider any age differences of galaxy mergers with different masses in the present study , this @xmath194 disagreement implies that the present chemodynamical model can not reproduce a mass - metallicity relation , which is one of possible interpretations for the origin of the observed cm relation .",
    "there are mainly two interpretations of the cm relation ; one is that the cm relation is due only to a mass - metallicity relation , i.e. , the relation that more massive ( luminous ) ellipticals have larger metallicity thus show redder colors , and the other is that both a mass - metallicity relation and a mass - age relation , i.e. , the relation that more massive ellipticals are older , play some roles in the formation of the cm relation .",
    "we here reject the idea that only a systematical difference in mean galaxy ages between ellipticals with different masses is a key determinant for the cm relation , primarily because some theoretical studies have already demonstrated that this idea is completely inconsistent with the observed redshift evolution of the slopes of the cm relation ( e.g. , kodama & arimoto 1997 ) .",
    "accordingly , whether or not the @xmath194 disagreement in the successful reproduction of the cm relation is really a serious problem of the present merger model of elliptical galaxy formation depends on which of the above two interpretations we adopt .",
    "firstly , we adopt the conventional and classical interpretation that elliptical galaxies @xmath195 @xmath196 @xmath197 are formed at high redshift and thus there are not any significant age differences between elliptical galaxies : the origin of the cm relation can be thus understood only in terms of a mass - metallicity relation . in this case , the above apparent disagreement is really a serious problem of the present chemodynamical model of elliptical galaxy formation and thus implies either that more sophisticated modification of the present chemodynamical model is necessary , including dissipative dynamics , snia and snii feedback effects , star formation parameters ( e.g , variable imf ) , and chemical mixing processes , or that typical luminous elliptical galaxies are not formed by major disk - disk mergers .",
    "secondly , we adopt the interpretation that less luminous ellipticals are as a whole younger and less metal - enriched galaxies : the origin of the cm relation is not necessarily a pure mass - metallicity relation , and thus a systematic age difference between ellipticals can also play a role in the formation of the cm relation ( e.g. , faber et al .",
    "1995 ; worthey et al .",
    "in this case , the above apparent inconsistency can be resolved by invoking the assumption that less luminous elliptical galaxies are formed by galaxy mergers with initially younger stellar populations or by later galaxy mergers .",
    "the considerably tight color - magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992 ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) and the relatively smaller redshift evolution of photometric properties of elliptical galaxies ( arag@xmath23n - salamanca et al . 1993",
    "; franx & van dokkum 1996 ) are generally considered to reflect the coeval formation of elliptical galaxies at high redshift .",
    "furthermore the observed considerably less significant evolution of the slope of the cm relation is suggested to reject the age spread larger thatn 1 gyr among elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , kodama & arimoto 1997 ) .",
    "these results imply that most of ellipticals are formed at high redshift and thus that the cm relation is a pure mass - metallicity relation .",
    "luminosity - dependence of line index [ mgfe ] and @xmath15 ( faber et al .",
    "1995 worthey et al . 1996 ) , on the other hand , indicates that less luminous ellipticals have younger stellar populations .",
    "these results imply that a systematic difference in mean galaxy ages between ellipticals can play some roles in the formation of the cm relation .",
    "thus , it has not been observationally clarified whether the observed cm relation is due essentially to a pure mass - metallicity relation or both a mass - age relation and a mass - metallicity one contribute to the cm relation .",
    "considering these apparently inconsistent observational results , it is reasonable for the present paper to claim that whether or not the apparent failure of the present merger model implies a serious disadvantage of the merger scenario of elliptical galaxy formation depends on future extensive observational studies on the mass - dependence of mean age and metallicity of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the present chemodynamical model predicts that merger remnants with larger central velocity dispersion ( @xmath173 ) have larger central @xmath12 index , principally because a larger amount of metal - enriched ism can be transferred to the central region of galaxy mergers and converted into stellar components there in more massive galaxy mergers with larger central velocity dispersion .",
    "although this result can give a qualitative explanation for the origin of @xmath12-@xmath173 relation of elliptical galaxies , the present merger model has some difficulties in explaining quantitatively the origin ( see figure 9 ) .",
    "for models with @xmath88 = 0.1 , a merger remnant with @xmath198 305 km / s has @xmath12 = 0.300 mag whereas that with @xmath199 105 km / s has @xmath12 = 0.272 mag .",
    "this result gives the relation @xmath200 .",
    "on the other hand , for models with @xmath88 = 0.5 , a merger remnant with @xmath198 284 km / s has @xmath12 = 0.291 mag whereas that with @xmath199 47 km / s has @xmath12 = 0.177 mag .",
    "this result gives the relation @xmath201 .",
    "the derived @xmath12-@xmath173 relations for the above two cases ( @xmath88 = 0.1 and 0.5 ) are not consistent reasonably well with the observed relation @xmath202 ( burstein et al .",
    "1988 ; davies 1996 ; jgensen 1997 ) .",
    "the reason for this inconsistency is primarily that the absolute magnitude of @xmath203 for less luminous merger remnants in the present study , in particular , for models with @xmath88 = 0.0 and 0.1 , is appreciably larger than the observed one . we did not consider any age differences of galaxy mergers with different masses in the present study",
    "accordingly this inconsistency implies that the present chemodynamical model have failed to reproduce a metallicity-@xmath173 relation , which is one of possible interpretations for the origin of the observed @xmath203-@xmath173 relation . the observed small scatter in the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation ( bender , burstein , & faber 1993 ) probably allows the following two interpretations on the origin of the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation .",
    "one is that a @xmath12-@xmath173 relation results exclusively from a metallicity-@xmath173 relation ( i.e. , the relation that a larger @xmath173 galaxy has larger stellar metallicity ) , and the other is that both a metallicity-@xmath173 relation and a age-@xmath173 ( i.e. , the relation that a larger @xmath173 galaxy has older stellar age ) can contribute to the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation ( we here consider that the observed small scatter in the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation rules out the interpretation that only a systematic age difference between ellipticals can explain totally the origin of the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation ) .",
    "accordingly , whether or not our failure in the successful reproduction of the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation is a serious problem of the present merger model of elliptical galaxy formation depends on which of the above two interpretations we adopt .",
    "firstly , we adopt the interpretation that the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation reflects only the dependence of stellar mean metallicity on @xmath173 ( or mass ) in the central part of elliptical galaxies . in this case , the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation derived in the present merger model of elliptical galaxies is really inconsistent with observational one , which implies that inward transfer of metals ( mg ) during dissipative galaxy merging is not so efficient as the present merger model predicts especially for less luminous galaxy mergers . for this case",
    ", we must either construct a more elaborated and realistic chemodynamical model of galaxy mergers and thereby explore again the origin of the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation or conclude that major disk - disk galaxy merging is not closely associated with the formation of typical elliptical galaxies . secondly",
    ", we adopt the interpretation that less luminous ellipticals with smaller @xmath173 are more likely to show both smaller metallicity and younger ages thus show smaller @xmath12 . in this case , our failure is not so serious problem for the present chemodynamical model of elliptical galaxy formation , principally because we can reproduce the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation by invoking the assumption that less luminous ellipticals with smaller @xmath173 are formed by mergers with initially younger stellar populations or by later mergers .    as is the case of the cm relation , it is observationally unclear which of the above two interpretations is more plausible and reasonable for the origin of the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation .",
    "observation studies on the redshift evolution of the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation in cluster ellipticals ( ziegler & bender 1997 ) , the color - magnitude diagram of stellar populations of m32 by @xmath204 ( grillmair et al . 1996 ) , and the dependence of the slope of the fp on the observational wavelength ( pahre et al . 1998 ) indicate younger stellar populations in less luminous ellipticals . the considerably smaller scatter in the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation",
    ", however , implies coeval formation of elliptical galaxies at higher redshift universe ( bender et al . 1993 ) .",
    "furthermore there are no observational studies , at least now , which clearly demonstrate that less luminous ellipticals @xmath195 @xmath196 @xmath197 have younger stellar populations in the central part of galaxies . we are accordingly conservative to determine the more plausible interpretation for the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation .",
    "thus , it is safe for us to say that it depends on more extensive future observational studies whether or not the present numerical results on the @xmath12-@xmath173 relation are really consistent with observational ones .",
    "we have numerically investigated chemodynamical evolution of major disk - disk galaxy mergers in order to explore the origin of mass - dependent chemical , photometric , and spectroscopic properties observed in elliptical galaxies .",
    "the present study is an extended version of our previous study ( paper i ) , which is the first step toward the understanding of a close physical relationship between dynamical evolution and chemical one in galaxy mergers .",
    "the present chemodynamical model is more realistic and sophisticated than our paper i in the following three points : ( 1 ) instead using instantaneous chemical mixing approximation , we consider time - delay between star formation and metal ejection mainly from type ia and ii supernovae .",
    "( 2 ) feedback effects of type ia and ii supernovae on dynamical and chemical evolution of galaxy mergers are incorporated .",
    "( 3 ) time - evolution of enrichment processes is solved for each of chemical components , h , he , mg , o , and fe .",
    "we have found that initial galactic mass ( @xmath0 ) is one of critical determinants for chemical , photometric , and spectroscopic properties of merger remnants .",
    "the essential reason for the derived mass - dependence is that galactic mass can largely determine total amount of metal - enriched interstellar gas , star formation histories of galaxy mergers , and the effectiveness of type ia and ii supernova feedback , all of which greatly affect chemodynamical evolution of galaxy mergers . in particular ,",
    "the difference in the effectiveness of type ia and ii supernova feedback between galaxy mergers with different masses is found to determine not only the @xmath130 properties but also the @xmath205 ones in ellipticals with different masses .",
    "what we should emphasize here is that since this paper is only the first step toward the deep understanding of chemodynamical and spectrophotometric evolution of galaxy mergers , we completely neglect some possibly important effects of galactic dynamics on chemophotometric evolution of galaxies .",
    "accordingly , some dynamical effects that are not investigated in the present paper can greatly modify the derived mass - dependence of chemophotometric properties of merger remnants . among these , dynamical effects of galactic bulges are particularly important in the sense that bulges can largely control inward and radial mass - transfer of interstellar gas ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ) and consequently determine star formation histories of galaxy mergers and the nature of stellar populations formed by the induced secondary starbursts .",
    "probably these dynamical effects of bulges modify the absolute magnitude of radial gradients of spectrophotometric properties derived in the present merger model without bulges .",
    "our future studies with a more realistic merger model will investigate in detail how galaxy bulges affect the nature of stellar populations of merger remnants .",
    "main results obtained in this study are the following seven .",
    "\\(1 ) more massive ( luminous ) ellipticals formed by galaxy mergers between more massive spirals have larger metallicity and thus show redder colors , principally because a larger amount of metal - enriched ism can be converted into stellar components in more massive galaxy mergers .",
    "this result implies that the origin of the cm relation of elliptical galaxies can be closely associated with dissipative galaxy merging with star formation .",
    "the typical metallicity ranges from @xmath2 1.0 solar abundance ( @xmath206 ) for ellipticals formed by mergers with @xmath4 to @xmath2 2.0 solar ( z @xmath207 ) for those with @xmath6 .",
    "\\(2 ) the absolute magnitude of negative metallicity gradients developed in galaxy mergers is more likely to be larger for massive ellipticals",
    ". typical value of metallicity gradient ( @xmath157 ) for @xmath9 ( where @xmath208 is effective radius of a merger remnant ) is -0.13 for ellipticals with @xmath6 and -0.03 for those with @xmath4 .",
    "absolute magnitude of metallicity gradient correlates with that of age gradient in ellipticals in the sense that an elliptical with steeper negative metallicity gradient is more likely to show steeper age gradient .",
    "\\(3 ) irrespective of galactic mass , a stellar population in the central part is both younger and more metal - enriched than that in the outer part in an elliptical galaxy formed by dissipative galaxy merging with star formation .",
    "this is essentially because metal - enriched ism can be transferred to the central part of galaxy mergers owing to efficient gas fueling during dissipative galaxy merging with star formation and preferentially converted into stellar components there in the later phase of the merging .",
    "\\(4 ) abundance ratio of [ mg / fe ] does not depend so strongly on galactic mass ( typically @xmath209 solar ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude of the radial gradient of [ mg / fe ] is rather small and does not depend on galactic mass ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "\\(5 ) radial color gradient is more likely to be larger for more massive ellipticals , which reflects that the metallicity gradient is larger for more massive ellipticals .",
    "for example , typical @xmath7 color gradient ( @xmath8 ) for @xmath9 is -0.13 for ellipticals with @xmath6 and -0.07 for those with @xmath4 .",
    "\\(6 ) @xmath12 line index in the central part of ellipticals ( @xmath13 ) is larger for more massive ellipticals , principally because a larger amount of metal - enriched ism can be fueled to the central part of mergers and converted into stellar components there in more massive galaxy mergers .",
    "this result implies that the origin of @xmath191 relation observed in elliptical galaxies can be closely associated with the difference in total amount of metal - enriched ism transferred to galactic center between galaxy mergers with different masses .",
    "the radial gradient of @xmath12 ( @xmath210 ) is also more likely to be larger for massive ellipticals .",
    "@xmath210 correlates well with the central @xmath12 in ellipticals . for most of the present merger models ,",
    "ellipticals show @xmath171 radial gradient of @xmath15 line index .",
    "\\(7 ) both @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are total stellar mass of galaxy mergers , @xmath21-band luminosity , and @xmath22-band one , respectively , depend on galactic luminosity in such a way that more luminous ellipticals have larger @xmath16 and smaller @xmath17 .",
    "this result reflects that more luminous merger remnants are more likely to have larger mean stellar metallicity .",
    "these seven numerical results derived in the present chemodynamical merger model of elliptical galaxy formation imply that the observed fundamental dependence of chemophotometric properties of ellipticals on galactic mass or luminosity ( e.g. , the cm relation , the @xmath191 relation , and the fp ) can be understood in terms of mass - dependent chemodynamical evolution of galaxy merges .",
    "thanks to the japan society for promotion of science ( jsps ) research fellowships for young scientist .",
    "chemical , photometric , and spectroscopic evolution of galaxies are generally considered to depend not only on star formation histories of galaxies resulting from dynamical evolution of galaxies , as is investigated in the present study , but also on detailed properties of imf , @xmath99 , and @xmath98 .",
    "accordingly we should emphasize that the results derived in the present study ( with the salpeter imf , @xmath102 , and @xmath211 ) are _ only true for _ galaxy mergers with the salpeter imf , @xmath102 , and @xmath211 in a quantitative sense : we should admit limited applicability of the present chemodynamical model .",
    "we here present dependence of chemical , photometric , and spectroscopic evolution of a singe stellar population ( ssp ) on imf , @xmath99 , and @xmath98 , and thereby show more clearly how strongly or weakly the results derived in the present numerical results can depend on imf , @xmath99 , and @xmath98 .",
    "in particular , we describe ( 1 ) time evolution of ejected metals in a ssp with variously different imf and @xmath99 , and ( 2 ) photometric and spectroscopic evolution of the ssp .",
    "these two descriptions will help us to understand how numerical results derived in the present study can be changed if we adopt imf , @xmath99 , and @xmath98 other than those adopted in the present study",
    ".      time evolution of total amount of metals ( ( @xmath212 ) ejected from stars with variously deferent mass and lifetime in a ssp with a given metallicity depends on imf and @xmath99 .",
    "we here observe how the time evolution of o , fe , mg , and z ejected from stars depends on imf and @xmath99 , by showing the results for models with the salpeter imf , @xmath99=0.1@xmath213 , and @xmath98=120.0@xmath213 ( model a ) , with the salpeter imf , @xmath99=0.6@xmath213 , and @xmath98=120.0@xmath213 ( model b ) , and with imf with shallower slope ( the exponent of imf equal to @xmath214 ) , @xmath99=0.1@xmath213 , and @xmath98=120.0@xmath213 ( model c ) .",
    "the time evolution of model b corresponds to @xmath212 adopted in the main manuscript .",
    "it is clear from figure 14 that ( 1 ) z is larger in a ssp with larger @xmath99 for a given imf , ( 2 ) z is larger in a ssp with shallower imf slope for a given @xmath99 , and ( 3 ) the results of ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) can be applied to o , mg , and fe . these three results , though based on ssp analysis , are well consistent with previous studies solving fully chemical evolution of closed - box one - zone galactic models ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; vazdekis et al .",
    "these results accordingly imply that the _ absolute magnitude _ of present numerical results are changed if we adopt imf and @xmath99 other than those adopted in the present study .",
    "for example , if we adopt smaller @xmath99 ( shallower imf slope ) , mean stellar metallicity of galaxy mergers can become substantially smaller ( larger ) .",
    "thus , we again stress that although _ the relative importance _ of each parameter ( e.g. , galactic mass ) in chemophotometric evolution of galaxy mergers derived in the present study does not depend on imf and @xmath99 , the derived _ absolute magnitude _ of chemophotometric properties in merger remnants should be more carefully interpreted owing to dependences of chemical properties on imf and @xmath99 derived in the above three results .    in order to assess the validity of @xmath212 adopted in the present study , we furthermore check whether or not the time - evolution of stellar yield ( @xmath212 ) adopted in the present study can reproduce reasonably well even the chemical evolution of the abundance ratio of [ mg / fe ] , which has been already investigated by classical one - zone chemical evolution models ( e.g. , matteucci & tornamb 1987 ) .",
    "we investigate the @xmath215-@xmath216 evolution ( @xmath2 10 gyr ) of stellar [ mg / fe ] ( the ratio of stellar mg abundance to stellar fe one in units of solar [ mg / fe ] ) produced by stellar systems with three different types of ssp in model a , b , and c. we check whether or not the [ mg / fe ] can finally be 0.0 that is a typical value for the solar neighborhood in the galaxy , in which chemical evolution is considered to proceed for more than 10 gyr .",
    "figure 15 describes the time evolution of [ mg / fe ] for model a , b , and c. it is clear from figure 15 that ( 1 ) model b , the @xmath212 of which is exactly the same as that used in the main manuscript , can reproduce the typical value of [ mg / fe ] in the solar neighborhood in the galaxy ( [ mg / fe]@xmath20.0 ) after long - term evolution , and ( 2 ) final value of [ mg / fe ] does not depend so strongly on imf and @xmath99 .",
    "these results accordingly justify the @xmath212 adopted in the present study . considering the [ mg / fe ] value of 0.2@xmath20.3 derived for galaxy mergers and that of @xmath2 0.0 for the above ssp models with long - term and less rapid chemical evolution , the above two results",
    "furthermore imply that the higher values of [ mg / fe ] derived in the present merger model is closely associated with dissipative galaxy merging with rapid star formation .",
    "we show how fundamental characteristics of spectrophotometric evolution of ssp with solar metallicity depend on imf and @xmath99 in figure 16 for model a , b , and c. in calculating spectrophotometric properties of ssp , we adopt the pegase code of fioc & rocca - volmerange ( 1997 ) which can reproduce the gissel96 ssp .",
    "it is clear from figure 16 that ( 1 ) the ratio of stellar mass ( @xmath18 ) to luminosity ( @xmath175 ) is strongly dependent on imf and @xmath99 , and ( 2 ) the @xmath217 and @xmath133 colors are not so different between models with different imf and @xmath99 . in the present study",
    ", we derive spectrophotometric properties of merger remnant by using the gissel96 ssp in which the salpeter imf and @xmath218 are assumed , nevertheless we adopt the salpeter imf and @xmath102 ( that is , we adopt a certain ` approximation ' in deriving the spectrophotometric properties . ) . accordingly ,",
    "spectrophotometric evolution of galaxy mergers is not self - consistently solved in a strict sense and more careful interpretations for results derived in the present study are necessary . observing the above two results on the differences in spectrophotometric properties of ssp between model a @xmath2 c , we can assess the validity of the ` approximation ' : global integrated colors derived in the present study can be approximately correct whereas mass - to - light - ratio can @xmath219 .",
    "thus we must again emphasize that discussing the dependence of spectrophotometric properties of merger remnants on galactic parameters such as initial disk mass is considerably sensible whereas comparing the _ absolute magnitude _ of the present numerical results ( in particular , mass - to - light - ratio ) with those of observational ones is not plausible : what is more vital in the present study is to clarify the @xmath146 @xmath147 of galactic parameters ( e.g. , galactic mass ) in determining spectrophotometric properties of merger remnants .",
    "the essential reason for mass - dependent properties of galaxy mergers is that galactic mass can determine both @xmath74 and @xmath123 .",
    "we here describe the reason for the mass - dependence of @xmath74 and @xmath123 .",
    "observational background for the mass - dependence of @xmath74 is given in detail in our paper i. firstly the expected mass dependence of @xmath74 is described as follows .",
    "the parameter @xmath74 is set to be proportional to @xmath220/@xmath221 , where @xmath220 and @xmath221 are the dynamical time - scale and the time - scale of gas consumption by star formation , respectively .",
    "we here define the mass of a galactic disk , the total mass of luminous and dark matter , and size of the progenitor as @xmath222 , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 , respectively .",
    "we consider here that gas mass in a disk is equal to @xmath222 for simplicity .",
    "the @xmath220 is given as @xmath225 provided that the coefficient in the schmidt law is not dependent on the galactic mass ( or luminosity ) , we can derive @xmath221 as follows .",
    "@xmath226 where @xmath227 is the surface density of the gas disk .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 is the exponent of schmidt law , which is the same as that used in previous subsections . assuming the freeman s law and the constant ratio of @xmath224 to the scale length of exponential disk",
    ", we derive @xmath228 assuming that the degree of self - gravity of a galactic disk is described as @xmath229 then we can derive @xmath230 since @xmath231 is considered to have positive value ( @xmath232 : saglia 1996 ) , this relationship predicts that @xmath74 becomes larger as @xmath222 increases .",
    "if we adopt the observed trend that more luminous disks have larger surface density , such as @xmath233 ( mcgaugh & blok 1997 ) , instead of using the freeman s law , we can obtain @xmath234 . since in the present study",
    ", we assume , for simplicity , that the ratio of dynamical mass to initial disk mass is constant for galaxy mergers with different masses ( that is , @xmath235 ) , and furthermore that @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath236 ( freeman s law ) , the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath74 adopted in the present study is described as : @xmath237    secondly the expected mass dependence of @xmath123 is described as follows .",
    "if we neglect the importance of details of three dimensional structure of a galaxy with dark matter halo in determining the total potential energy of the galaxy , total potential energy of an initial disk ( @xmath238 ) is then considered to be within an order of @xmath239 .",
    "assuming that the total number of supernovae is basically dependent on @xmath0 , the total energy of supernovae that can be potentially accumulated within the disk ( @xmath240 ) is proportional to @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is total energy produced by @xmath26 supernova ( @xmath243 erg both for snia and snii ) .",
    "accordingly , the ratio of total supernova energy ( that can be ejected in the course of galactic evolution ) to total potential energy of the galaxy , which corresponds to the effectiveness of supernova feedback in galactic evolution , is as follows : @xmath244 in the above equation , the constant @xmath245 and @xmath246 are assumed .",
    "this equation means that supernova feedback effects can not so strongly affect evolution of galaxies for more massive galaxy mergers . it should be emphasized here that the expected @xmath0 dependences of @xmath74 and @xmath123 are based on some assumptions adopted for deriving these dependence ."
