    "are pretty close .",
    "let us consider the applicability of the suggested method to real organic amorphous semiconductors .",
    "the necessary conditions for the direct applications of the method are : 1 ) spatially uniform generation of initial electron - hole pairs ; 2 ) carrier recombination can be neglected ; 3 ) the total trapped charge @xmath111 must be less that the extracted charge @xmath112 for the high end of the spanned range of @xmath4 ; 4 ) electric field is a constant in the bulk of the sample , so the total charge in the sample must be much less than the electrode charge @xmath26 , and 5 ) charge transport should not be very fast ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "first condition means in our case that the absorption of the light in the sample must be weak .",
    "the two - photon absorption as a way for the carrier generation is not important by itself for the application of the method .",
    "the only reason to use this particular method of the generation of initial carriers is a weak absorption of the 1064 nm light in meh - ppv , thus ensuring the spatially uniform initial distribution of carriers .",
    "other methods of carrier generation , capable to produce the uniform distribution , can be used as well .    in the second condition we mean a non - geminate recombination of charge carriers , because the geminate recombination could be phenomenologically taken into account simply by the redefinition of the proportionality coefficient @xmath114 in the relation between the light pulse energy and total number of initially generated free carriers @xmath115 .",
    "absence of the non - geminate recombination can be reliably established by checking the linearity of the relation @xmath6 for high @xmath4 .",
    "the third condition is a principal one , because if it is not valid , then we are dealing with the linear regime of low trap filling described by eq . , where the only relevant trap - related parameter is @xmath116 ( see eq . for the case @xmath117 ) .",
    "naturally , the separate extraction of @xmath36 and @xmath20 is not possible in this regime . at the same time",
    ", this condition is not an obstacle _ per se _ for the use of the method , it just dictates the proper range of @xmath4 , most favorable for the determination of the trap density .",
    "last two conditions provide more serious restrictions because in some situations they are mutually contradictive .",
    "indeed , the applied voltage @xmath22 should be high enough to provide the uniformity of the electric field in the sample , but at the same time the carrier velocity @xmath29 grows with the voltage , thus invariably shifting the sample to the unfavorable regime of high @xmath118 .",
    "yet the example of the meh - ppv device indicates that for very typical organic materials the suggested method could be used successfully .    in the basic eq .",
    "we omitted the diffusive term .",
    "short analysis in the appendix shows that the diffusive contribution to @xmath100 may be safely neglected in most cases .",
    "in this paper we suggested the simple method for the estimation of the density of deep traps capable to keep charge carriers in amorphous semiconductors for a long time .",
    "one of the most important advantages of the method is a simplicity of the experimental set - up , which includes only standard widely used equipment . in the previous section",
    "the major conditions , necessary for a successful application of the method , have been discussed .",
    "it turns out that these conditions are not very difficult to fulfil , thus the method may be considered as an almost universal one for the estimation of the density of deep traps in amorphous organic materials .",
    "successful application of the method to the estimation of the concentration of deep traps in typical organic semiconductor meh - ppv supports this conclusion .",
    "there is another limitation of the suggested method , directly related to the structure of our transport model : there is no diffusion term in eq . , we set the diffusion coefficient @xmath119 .",
    "let us estimate when the diffusive contribution is negligible .",
    "assuming @xmath120 ( weak diffusion ) , the diffusive contribution to @xmath100 could be estimated in the following way . at @xmath121",
    "the distribution of movable carriers is uniform in space .",
    "it means that the diffusion provides the most important contribution at the rear front of @xmath30 , the only place where the gradient of @xmath122 is large .",
    "the width of the rear front increases with time as @xmath123 , or , equivalently , with the traveled distance @xmath124 as @xmath125 . at the location of the rear front the concentrations of carriers and empty traps are ,",
