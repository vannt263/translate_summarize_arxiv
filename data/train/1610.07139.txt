    "in contrast , symbiotic stars consist of a compact star , mostly a white dwarf , and a giant star losing a large amount of mass in the form of a slow stellar wind .",
    "some fraction of the slow stellar wind from the giant companion is gravitationally captured by the white dwarf ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it is highly controversial whether an accretion disk is formed in a stable fashion in symbiotic stars .",

    "no such ir excess is apparent in s type symbiotics .",
    "the orbital periods of d type symbiotics are poorly known and are presumed to exceed several decades , implying that the giant companion is separated from the white dwarf by tens of au .",
    "this is in high contrast in that many s type symbiotics are known to have orbital periods of several hundreds of days , which points out that the giant companion is much closer to the white dwarf than their d type counterparts .    a significant fraction of symbiotic stars exhibit unique broad emission features at 6825   and 7082   with a width @xmath7 .",
    "these mysterious spectral features were identified by schmid ( 1989 ) , who proposed that they are formed through raman scattering of o  vi@xmath0 1032 and 1038 with atomic hydrogen .",
    "raman scattering proceeds with an incident far uv photon blueward of ly@xmath8 on a hydrogen atom in the ground state , which finally de - excites into the @xmath9 state .",
    "as opposed to raman scattering , the elastic version is rayleigh scattering .    for an incident line photon ,",

    "in addition , the line profiles of these raman features are characterized by double or triple peak structures .",
    "another notable point is that the raman 6825 and 7082 features exhibit disparate profiles . in particular , usually the blue part of raman",
    "7082 feature is relatively more suppressed than its raman 6825 counterpart . the profile disparity for raman o  vi features",
    "was also noted by other researchers including schmid ( 1999 ) , who proposed that the kinematics associated with the giant wind is mainly responsible for the multiple peak structures .",
    "@xcite advanced a view that the emission region forms a part of the accretion flow around the white dwarf resulting in multiple peak profiles in raman features ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite used spectrophotometric data of a few symbiotic stars to report that the raman o  vi feature at 6825   is about 4 times stronger than the 7082 feature on average .",
    "@xcite presented their spectroscopic observations of several symbiotic stars to show that the flux ratio of raman o  vi at 6825   and 7082 ranges from around 2 to 7 .",
    "in particular , d type symbiotics such as rr  telescopii and v1016  cygni exhibit high flux ratios whereas s type symbiotics show low flux ratios .",
    "they attributed to this tendency to higher raman conversion efficiency in ` s ' type symbiotics than in ` d ' type ones , where the raman conversion efficiency is defined as the number ratio @xmath23 between the raman scattered photons and the incident line photons .",
    "considering the role played by the raman features as diagnostic of the accretion flow in symbiotic stars , studies of fundamental properties on the conversion efficiency are of importance for proper interpretation of spectroscopic data . a pioneering and fairly comprehensive work using a monte carlo technique",
    "was presented by @xcite , who included angular distribution and polarization in his simulations .",
    "basic scattering geometries such as an illuminated slab and sphere were considered to reveal the systematic changes in flux and polarization expected in a binary orbital motion . @xcite and @xcite also presented more extended studies of raman scattered in scattering geometries that include an expanding region around the giant component .    despite these sophisticated and extensive previous works , we assert that useful information regarding a representative column density around the giant component can be gained through simple monte carlo simulations , which we present in this paper .",

    "[ cfht ] , we show our spectra around raman features of two symbiotic stars hm  sge ( top panels ) and ag  dra ( bottom panels ) obtained with espadons installed on the 3.6 m _ canada - france - hawaii telescope_. the observation of hm  sge and ag  dra was made on 2014 august 16 and september 6 , respectively .",
    "hm  sge was observed in spectropolarimetric mode for which the spectral resolution is 68,000 . in the case of ag  dra",
    ", we choose object only spectroscopic mode for which the spectral resolution is 81,000 .",
    "the total integration time for hm  sge and ag  dra was 9,600 s and 2,000 s , respectively .",
    "hm  sge is a d type symbiotic star , having a mira variable as giant companion , whereas ag  dra is an s type symbiotic star with an orbital period of 550 days ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hm  sge is known to have erupted as a symbiotic nova in 1975 @xcite .",
    "it is also known to exhibit raman scattered features of and ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "based on their spectropolarimetric monitoring observations , @xcite proposed that the orbital period of hm  sge amounts to @xmath105 years with a caveat that the data quality was insufficient for definite conclusion",
    ". ag  dra is known to be a yellow symbiotic star having an early k type giant as mass donor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )    in the top panels for hm",
    "sge , the simulated profiles are obtained adopting the same finite cylinder model with @xmath106 considered in the previous subsection . on the other hand , in the bottom panels , a finite cylinder model with @xmath107",
    "is used with the other conditions the same as in the top panels .",
    "we obtain relatively poor fit of the monte carlo simulated profiles to the _ cfht _ spectra .",
    "however , the purpose of the current profile comparison is not a detailed profile fit but a simple estimate of the representative neutral column density of the scattering region from the ratio @xmath2 . from this comparison ,",
    "it is clear that ag  dra is characterized by a neutral region with @xmath3 an order of magnitude larger than that of hm  sge .",
    "we suggest that this is attributed to the closeness of the giant component to the white dwarf in s type symbiotic stars .",
    "as @xcite explained in their observations of a number of symbiotic stars , ` s ' type symbiotics systematically show higher raman conversion efficiency than ` d ' type symbiotics . based on near simultaneous far uv and optical spectroscopic observations , @xcite also summarized in their table  11 higher ratios @xmath108/[n_{7082}/n_{1038}]$ ] in ` s ' type symbiotics such as z  and and ag  dra than in ` d ' type symbiotic stars v1016  cyg and rr  tel .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the flux ratio @xmath2 using a monte carlo technique mainly as a function of @xmath3 for a few simple scattering geometries .",
    "the smallest flux ratio of @xmath109 is obtained when the emission source is outside a neutral slab with infinite lateral dimensions and rayleigh - raman optically thick in the normal direction . in this case , a significant fraction of photons escape from the neutral region through a few rayleigh scatterings near the illuminated boundary . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum flux ratio of 3.5 is obtained in the case of a spherical neutral region with a moderate column density of @xmath110 inside which the emission source is embedded .",
    "this maximum value is attributed to a nonlinear behavior shown in raman conversion of @xmath11032 whereas @xmath11038 remains in the linear domain .    according to @xcite the flux ratios of @xmath111 and @xmath112 measured for the symbiotic star rr  tel correspond to our result @xmath113 in this work in which we fix the number flux @xmath100 .",
    "the ratio of raman conversion efficiencies @xmath114 strongly implies that the neutral scattering region is characterized by @xmath87 .",
    "another notable point is that the flux ratio in the optically thin limit may be irrelevant to real observations because raman fluxes are very weak .",
    "if we require raman conversion efficiency of @xmath115 , then the representative column density of the neutral region around rr  tel is suggested to be found in the range @xmath116 .",
    "attenuation of far uv radiation due to rayleigh scattering in symbiotic stars is useful in estimating the neutral column density of the giant atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "along a line of sight from the white dwarf to the giant photosphere , it is expected that @xmath117 .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed a neutral column density @xmath118 toward the giant atmosphere of the symbiotic star eg  and based on their measurement using _ iue _ and _ hst _ spectra . from this work",
    ", we propose that the flux ratio @xmath2 can be a rough proxy to estimate @xmath3 in symbiotic stars .      with the giant companion being closer to the white dwarf primary ,",
    "s type symbiotics tend to be in a more favorable condition to establish a neutral scattering region with significantly higher @xmath3 than d type symbiotics .",
    "this leads to the ratio @xmath2 systematically larger in d type symbiotics than in s type symbiotics , which was pointed out by @xcite .",
    "however , not only the separation between the binary components , but also very different properties of the wind from cool components in s - type and d - type symbiotics can affect their region .",
    "a crude estimate of the representative @xmath3 can be given by assuming that the mass loss process is characterized by a spherical stellar wind with velocity field at a radial distance @xmath119 from the giant @xmath120 here , @xmath121 is the wind terminal velocity , @xmath122 is a parameter of order unity and @xmath123 is the launching radius of the giant stellar wind ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a line of sight from the white dwarf is specified by the impact parameter @xmath124 with respect to the giant .",
    "if we disregard the photoionization process due to strong far uv radiation from the white dwarf , the column density along this line is given by @xmath125 with the choice of @xmath126 and @xmath127 @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath128 is the mean molecular weight of the giant stellar wind . whereas the definite integral is explicitly written as @xmath129,\\ ] ]",
    "a more useful approach is to obtain a rough approximation by taking @xmath128 and the value in the parenthesis to be unity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we may take a typical impact parameter @xmath124 as the binary separation @xmath130 . in the case of ` d ' type symbiotics @xmath131 , whereas for ` s ' type symbiotics the binary separation @xmath124 is comparable to or a few times @xmath123 . with this consideration",
    "we may write @xmath132 where @xmath133 , @xmath134 $ ] and @xmath135 .",
    "@xcite proposed that the mass loss rate is correlated with the spectral type in such a way that later spectral type giants tend to lose mass faster ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . in the case ` d ' type symbiotic star hm  sge , our result of @xmath136 implies a relation @xmath137 . considering that the orbital parameters are only poorly known for most ` d ' type symbiotic stars , raman spectroscopy can be of significant use in putting constraints on the orbital parameters .",
    "@xcite used raman scattered feature at 6545    to give an estimate of the mass loss rate of the ` d ' type symbiotic star v1016  cygni .",
    "they proposed a mass loss rate @xmath138 based on their analysis .",
    "a lower estimate of @xmath139 was proposed by @xcite , who used the center shift of raman scattered feature at 4850   attributed to the atomic physics of raman scattering .",
    "their estimate was @xmath140 , which is quite small for effective raman conversion of .",
    "because the line center of raman scattered feature can also be affected from the kinematics of the region with respect to the emission region , there is possibility that their estimate would be modified to a higher column density .    considering that @xmath01025 and 972 have cross sections @xmath141",
    ", we may expect higher raman conversion efficiencies in the formation of raman features at 6545   and 4850   than lines . for @xmath1949 , the cross section",
    "@xmath142 is significantly smaller than the two lower transition lines , leading to lower raman conversion efficiency .",
    "one complicating factor in the analysis of raman scattering involving is that there are many scattering branches into the ir region .",
    "sophisticated simulations designed to explain various raman scattered features including and will provide very strong constraints on the scattering geometry and mass loss rate involving the giant component .",
    "the difference in scattering numbers affects the degree of linear polarization as well as the flux ratio @xmath2 .",
    "as the scattering number increases , the radiation field tends to be isotropized resulting in weak polarization .",
    "@xcite reported that the raman 7082 in the symbiotic star he2 - 38 exhibits the degree of linear polarization of 9.2 percent , which is in contrast with the much more weakly polarized raman 6825 with the degree of 5.3 percent .",
    "they pointed out that the this difference can be understood because raman 7082 photons are formed with less number of scatterings than raman 6825 photons .",
    "as is shown in this work , the mean scattering number is a complicated function of the scattering optical depth and the branching ratio .",
    "this work will be extended to obtain raman fluxes according to the emergent wave vector for further polarimetric analysis .",
    "it is expected that combination of these differences in flux and polarization apparent in spectropolarimetric data will be used to put strong constraints on the mass loss and transfer processes occurring in symbiotic stars .",
