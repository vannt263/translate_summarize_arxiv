    "the ejecta structure of a type ii - p supernova ( sn  ii - p ) may be sketchy portrayed as a combination of a hydrogen envelope and a `` mixed core '' .",
    "the latter , being a macroscopic mixture of newly synthesised elements , such as , he , o , @xmath1ni with a fraction of the hydrogen envelope , is responsible for the luminosity at the nebular epoch , i.e. , at the age @xmath2 d. the model of mixed core of sn  ii - p is fundamental to the assessement of the nuclesynthesis yields , which is the subject of great interest",
    ". two recent nebular models of sn  1987a ( de kool , li & mccray @xcite ; kozma & fransson @xcite ) demonstrate that the basic physical processes in the mixed core are well understood to make feasible the composition analysis . however , to achieve this goal a nebular model of sn  ii - p should , first , pass the rigorous test on reproducing fluxes and profiles of hydrogen lines , including h@xmath0 .    here",
    "i argue that the model of the h@xmath0 line in sn  ii - p at the early nebular epoch ( 100200 d after the outburst ) should essentially include effects of radiation damping wings always ignored before .",
    "the physical reason for the damping wings to play a role is a high degree of a non - thermal excitation of hydrogen in the mixed core of sn  ii - p , which results in the large h@xmath0 optical depth at the early nebular epoch . in this situation to model h@xmath0 damping wing effects the sobolev ( local escape ) approximation must be abandoned .",
    "the radiation transfer in the physical and the frequency space simulated with the monte carlo method is applied to demonstrate expected effects of the h@xmath0 damping wings in sn  ii - p ( section 2 ) .",
    "recently found in sn  1997d a disparity between the large asymmetry of h@xmath0 at the early nebular phase and the symmetric h@xmath0 profile at the late nebular epoch ( chugai & utrobin @xcite ) admits a simple explanation in terms of the damping wings ( section 3 ) .",
    "another motivation to address the issue of the h@xmath0 damping wings in sn  ii - p is that this factor may provide an independent diagnostic tool for constraining parameters of the mixed core .",
    "the sobolev approximation widely used to analyse supernova optical spectra is justified for most lines because of a highly supersonic expansion , @xmath3 , ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the expansion and the thermal velocity , respectively ) .",
    "however , if the optical depth in damping wings is large , the `` supersonic '' criterion for the local escape of photons should be replaced by the inequality @xmath6 ( chugai @xcite ) , where @xmath7 is the voigt parameter , @xmath8 is the sobolev optical depth ( @xmath9 is the line integrated absorption coefficient , @xmath10 is the wavelength , @xmath11 is the expansion time ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 voigt parameter is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the einstein transition probability , @xmath14 is the thermal doppler width ( kinetic temperature of 5000  k is adopted ) . at the early nebular epoch ( @xmath15",
    "d ) the sobolev optical depth of the mixed core in h@xmath0 may exceed @xmath16 ( xu et al .",
    "@xcite ) implying that @xmath17 , i.e. , is of the order of @xmath18 . in this case",
    "the local escape approximation is too crude , so that the full radiation transfer should be applied to compute the h@xmath0 line profile .",
    "one needs , first , to specify the frequency redistribution function for the h@xmath0 damping wings .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be the incident and scattered photon frequencies in the atom frame . with lower and upper levels broadened by the radiation damping , the atomic angle - averaged frequency redistribution function in far wings ( @xmath21 ) may be written as @xmath22 ( oxenius @xcite ) , where @xmath23 is the normalized absorption coefficient and    @xmath24    here @xmath25 and @xmath26 are voigt parameters for the lower and the upper level .",
    "thermal velocity effects in the wings are negligible and will be ignored here .",
    "this implies that the frequency redistribution function in the wings is the same for the atom and the fluid frame .",
    "the redistribution function may be essentially simplified to reduce the number of scattering in the monte carlo computations preserving good precision . since multiple local scattering in the doppler core ( @xmath27 ) eventually ends up with the photon re - emitted in the wings , the scatterings in the doppler core",
    "may be omitted by adopting the function @xmath28 equal to zero in the core @xmath29 .",
    "after the re - normalization this function is labeled @xmath30 .",
    "for instance , the function @xmath31 in the second term of eq.([eq : prob ] ) transforms into @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "results are not sensitive to the choice of the core width and @xmath35 is assumed .",
    "the h@xmath0 photon history is simulated as follows .",
    "the photon is launched with the distribution function @xmath36 .",
    "when propagating it experiences a redshift in the co - moving frame until it randomly scatters or escapes . if scattered , the frequency of the re - emitted photon is randomly choosen according to the modified distribution function @xmath30 .",
    "the process continues until the photon escapes .    to demonstrate the role of h@xmath0 damping wings in sn  ii",
    "- p let us consider a freely expanding envelope ( @xmath37 , @xmath4 being the velocity at the radius @xmath38 at the expansion time @xmath11 ) with a homogeneous line - emitting core ( @xmath39 ) and a scattering halo ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the sobolev optical depth of the halo decreases outward as @xmath41 .",
    "the core , optically thin in the continuum , may emit a continuum radiation from homogeneously distributed sources .",
    "the velocity and the optical depth in the core ( subscript 1 ) and in the halo ( subscript 2 ) , respectively , are given in table 1 .",
    "the homogeneous core with the low optical depth in the model m1 produces a parabolic profile ( fig .",
    "1a ) expected for the sobolev approximation .",
    "when the optical depth is high ( models m2 and m3 ) the extended wings emerge , while the line core becomes broader and gets redshifted .",
    "all the effects are caused by the radiation transfer in the damping wings .",
    "note , that in the case of the sobolev approximation the models m2 and m3 would have the same parabolic profile as that of the model m1 . a conspicuous kink at the blue slope in the model m3 is caused by a self - absorption due to non - local scattering .",
    "the models m4 and m5 show how the models m1 and m3 are changed when a scattering halo and a continuum core are present ( fig .",
    "the model m5 gives a realistic impression of damping wings effects in h@xmath0 at the early nebular epoch of sn  ii - p .",
    "how would the inhomogeneity of the hydrogen distribution in the mixed core change these results ?",
    "generally , the optical depth in the damping wing depends not only on the local concentration of absorbers , but also on its filling factor ( @xmath42 ) , and , in lesser degree , both on the size of inhomogeneities , and on their topological properties . in the limit of small scale inhomogeneities , when the mean free path length in the far wing exceeds a typical size of the inhomogeneity , the optical depth in the wing may be reduced to a simple form @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the sobolev optical depth and @xmath45 is the frequency shift in comoving frame at the length interval @xmath46 . under this approximation",
    "the h@xmath0 profile from the inhomogeneous core is the same as that from the homogeneous core with the `` effective optical depth '' @xmath47 , the analysis of the h@xmath0 damping wings thus permits us to estimate the h@xmath0 effective optical depth in the mixed core , or , equivalently , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 being the population of the second hydrogen level ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the derived value of @xmath48 is independent of the adopted distance of a supernova .",
    "the spectra of the type ii - p supernova sn  1997d with a low expansion velocity have been obtained at the early ( @xmath50 d ) and the late ( @xmath51 d ) nebular epoch by turatto et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the nebular spectrum on day 300 was reproduced in the model of a spherically symmetric mixed core with the total ejecta mass of 6 @xmath52 and the kinetic energy of @xmath53 erg ( chugai & utrobin @xcite ) .",
    "however , it was stressed there that h@xmath0 on day 150 shows a significant redshift in a disparity with a spherically symmetric model .",
    "note , that the asphericity of the @xmath1ni distribution might produce the h@xmath0 asymmetry on day 150 likewise it was in sn  1987a .",
    "however , this reason for sn  1997d is discarded by the absence of h@xmath0 asymmetry on day 300 .",
    "we will see below that damping wings effects may resolve the revealed controversy .",
    "the assumed envelope model is similar to that of the section 2 , i.e. , it consists of a line - emitting homogeneous core and a scattering halo . for models considered here the core velocity is @xmath54 km s@xmath55 and the outer velocity of the scattering halo is @xmath56 km s@xmath55 ; the latter is consistent with the steep density drop in the range @xmath57 km s@xmath55 for the hydrodynamical model of sn  1997d ( chugai & utrobin @xcite ) .",
    "the sobolev optical depth in the halo is assumed to decrease outward as @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "an additional factor implemented into the model is the thomson scattering , although it is of minor importance .",
    "the corresponding optical depth ( @xmath60 ) of the mixed core , estimated from the h@xmath0 luminosity ( distance @xmath61 mpc ) using data by turatto et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , is 0.16 on day 150 and 0.08 on day 300 .",
    "bellow , i adopt @xmath62 for @xmath63 d and @xmath64 for @xmath65 d to roughly take into account that the hydrogen filling factor in the mixed core is essentially less than unity ( chugai & utrobin @xcite ) .    in the late time spectrum on day 300 the model without damping wings is not very much different to the observed profile ( fig .",
    "it implies that the damping wings at this epoch are not significant , although , the model with the damping wings and @xmath66 fits the observed profile better . on day 150 the model without damping wings is strikingly dissimilar to the observed profile : the latter is broader and shows both significant redshift and red wing . the model with damping wings included and @xmath67 turns out to be successful in the description of the observed profile .",
    "note , that with the core velocity set by the late time profile , the primary fitting parameter is the effective optical depth in the mixed core .    the found effective optical depth value being combined with the sobolev optical depth may be used to derive the hydrogen filling factor in the mixed core . to estimate the sobolev optical depth i adopt 0.002 @xmath52 of @xmath1ni ( turatto et al .",
    "@xcite ) in the mixed core ( @xmath68 km s@xmath55 ) .",
    "the density @xmath69 g @xmath70 is adopted on day 150 following the model of sn  1997d ( chugai & utrobin @xcite ) .",
    "the non - thermal excitation of hydrogen may be calculated assuming that all the energy of gamma - rays from the radioactive decay of @xmath1co is uniformly deposited in the mixed core , which is a sound approximation at the early nebular epoch when the mean free path for gamma - rays is small .",
    "the energy deposited in h - rich matter is spent ( apart from coulomb heating ) , eventually , on the excitation of the second level of hydrogen . with the depopulation rate controlled by the two - photon decay and the collisional de - excitation",
    "i find @xmath71 @xmath70 on day 150 , which leads to the sobolev optical depth of @xmath72 .",
    "the latter being combined with the effective optical depth ( @xmath73 ) results in the hydrogen filling factor of @xmath74 .",
    "the latter value is quite realistic , although it is a factor of 1.5 larger than the estimate from the nebular model on day 300 ( chugai & utrobin @xcite ) .",
    "the difference is not dramatic taking into account possible uncertainties of both models .",
    "the factor of ten lower value of the effective optical depth in h@xmath0 on day 300 compared to that on day 150 is consistent with the decrease of the sobolev optical depth in h@xmath0 expected for the mechanism of the non - thermal excitation ( e.g. , xu et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "although describing an inhomogeneity of the excited hydrogen in the mixed core in terms of the filling factor seems sensible , a possibility exists that between the mixed core and unmixed hydrogen envelope there is a transition layer of strongly excited hydrogen with the filling factor of unity . to estimate qualitatively effect of this component i introduced in the model on day 150 an additional spherical layer in the velocity range 650700 km s@xmath55 with filling factor of unity , negligibly small net emission , and the sobolev optical depth being equal to the effective optical depth of the mixed core .",
    "such a choice of optical depth suggests factor of three lower hydrogen excitation in the transition layer than in the mixed core .",
    "the new model is found to produce the same h@xmath0 profile as in the old model provided the effective optical depth of the mixed core is of @xmath75 , i.e. , 20% lower compared to the old model .",
    "this implies that the value of the h@xmath0 effective optical depth found from the profile modelling is quite robust to reasonable edditing the geometry of the distribution of the excited hydrogen in the mixed core .    summing up",
    ", the h@xmath0 damping wings effects provide a natural explanation for the dramatic discrepance between the model based on the sobolev approximation and the observed profile in sn  1997d on day 150 .",
    "this conclusion is strengthen by the absence of a reasonable alternative .",
    "at the early nebular epoch of sn  ii - p the h@xmath0 emission should exhibit observational signatures of damping wings .",
    "although , the damping wings were never considered before as relevant for supernova optical spectra , the claimed effects are robust and may be easily identified .",
    "we see damping wings effects in sn  1997d spectrum , where they are responsible for the redshift , large width and extended red wing of h@xmath0 on day 150 .",
    "the detection of h@xmath0 damping wings effects in sn  ii - p provides a direct estimate of the h@xmath0 effective optical depth ( i.e. the product of the sobolev optical depth and the hydrogen filling factor ) in a distance independent way .",
    "we thus obtain a reliable test for nebular models of sn  ii - p . on the other hand , with a confident nebular model in hand",
    ", we may able to measure the hydrogen filling factor in the mixed core .",
    "the price for this knowledge is the abandoning the sobolev approximation and the need for the full radiation transfer treatment of the h@xmath0 radiation .",
    "needless to say that the simple model of the h@xmath0 profile used above for sn  1997d admits some improvements .",
    "for instance , one may take the radial dependence of hydrogen excitation and filling factor in the mixed core into account .",
    "another modification , might be the inclusion of the absorption of h@xmath0 quanta in the paschen continuum .",
    "this may be done if the radiation transfer and the hydrogen excitation are calculated simultaneously .",
    "more detailed description of the hydrogen inhomogeneities is also welcome , although the expected change of the value of the effective optical depth would be within 20% .    to recover the damping wings in other sn  ii",
    "- p it is necessary to use at least two nebular spectra : at the early epoch , ( around day 150 ) and at the late epoch , but before the dust formation , ( e.g. , between 300 d and 400 d ) .",
    "the early nebular epoch is most appropriate to extract the information about damping wings , while the late time nebular spectrum provides a template to set the core velocity and to secure results from a confusing effects of asymmetric @xmath1ni distribution .",
    "notably , it is @xmath1ni asymmetry that prevent us from using a simple symmetric model to study h@xmath0 damping wings effects in sn  1987a .",
