    "as is well known , @xmath1 resonance is the first excited state of the nucleon and plays an important role in strong interaction physics .",
    "experimentally , @xmath2 s are produced in scattering pions or electron beams off a nucleon target .",
    "the @xmath1 has isospin 3/2 and therefore comes in four different charge states : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 with approximately the same mass and width .",
    "the spin of the @xmath1 is also 3/2 , and it is the lightest known particle with such a spin .",
    "it appears that it decays via @xmath7 with @xmath8 branching ratio @xcite , and only less than @xmath9 to the total decay width is coming from the em channel ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this em @xmath11 transition is predominantly of the magnetic dipole ( @xmath12 ) type .    with the lack of complete theoretical control over nonperturbative low energy qcd , at present , one should explore various complementary techniques to gain more understanding on nonperturbative qcd phenomena .",
    "the large @xmath0 limit is one such attempt that has been pursued for some time , and it was revived a decade ago by a proposal that in conjunction with the idea of holography , the large @xmath0 qcd in the strong coupling regime may be described by a weakly coupled dual five - dimensional ( 5d ) model , with the additional fifth direction playing the role of the energy scale @xcite . although the precise dual model of large @xmath0 qcd has not been found , several approximate models were proposed applying both so - called `` top - down '' @xcite and `` bottom - up '' @xcite approaches .",
    "the study of hadronic form factors in these models of holographic qcd @xcite@xcite allowed us to gain a confidence that the holographic qcd approach can be a useful complementary tool in predicting the low energy behavior of qcd at least in the large @xmath0 limit .    in this work ,",
    "our goal is to go one step further and investigate the @xmath13 transition form factors in the framework of holographic qcd .",
    "we will work in the top - down model proposed by sakai and sugimoto @xcite .",
    "baryons in this model have been studied recently @xcite@xcite and our methods are based on some of these developments . in particular , we start our analysis by considering the nonrelativistic nucleon - delta - vector meson vertices found by park - yi @xcite , and for completeness also discuss the related approach by hashimoto - sakai - sugimoto @xcite .    using the nonrelativistic result in ref .",
    "@xcite , we find a relativistic generalization of the nucleon - delta - vector meson vertex which is required for consistent treatment of transition form factors .",
    "this in turn is essential for comparison of the model predictions for nucleon - delta transition form factors with experiment .",
    "the knowledge of these form factors is proven to be an important and complex check for any model of strong interactions .",
    "thus , we would like to investigate what holographic qcd can tell us about this process and how well its predictions agree with experiment .",
    "since the virtual photon has three polarizations , the @xmath13 transition should be in general described by three independent form factors .",
    "these three form factors are related to the magnetic dipole ( @xmath12 ) , electric ( @xmath14 ) and coulomb ( @xmath15 ) quadrupole types of transitions .",
    "the @xmath16 transition was measured in the pion photoproduction and electroproduction reactions in the @xmath2-resonance energy region .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath15 transitions were found to be relatively small but nonzero at moderate momentum transfers @xmath17 , with the ratios @xmath18 and @xmath19 being at the level of a few percent .",
    "the smallness of these ratios seems to have a purely nonperturbative origin .",
    "indeed , the perturbative qcd studies @xcite predict the same strength for @xmath14 and @xmath12 transitions at asymptotically large @xmath17 , while experimentally , the @xmath20 ratio is negative and very close to zero for energies up to @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the smallness of the @xmath20 ratio is a very well - known prediction of the quark model , where the @xmath22 transition is described by a spin flip of a quark in the @xmath23-wave state , which in the @xmath11 case leads to the @xmath12 type of transition .",
    "any @xmath24-wave admixture in the wave function of @xmath2 would allow for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 quadrupole transitions .",
    "therefore , by measuring these transitions , one is able to observe the presence of the @xmath24-wave components and hence quantify to which extent the nucleon or the @xmath2 wave function deviates from the spherical shape .    within the nonrelativistic su(6 )",
    "quark model it was shown that @xmath14 is zero @xcite provided that quarks have zero orbital angular momentum .",
    "small values for @xmath20 in the region @xmath25 were obtained in the relativistic quark model , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite . in the large @xmath0 limit of qcd",
    ", it was shown that the @xmath20 ratio is of order @xmath26 @xcite without any assumption about the quark orbital angular momentum or intrinsic deformation of the baryon .",
    "we will show below that the same features can be also reproduced from the holographic qcd .",
    "there have been studies on the @xmath13 transition form factors using other methods , for example , the local quark - hadron duality approach motivated by qcd sum rules @xcite and the framework of the light - cone sum rules in @xcite .",
    "another approach using the method of qcd sum rules is given in ref .",
    "recent lattice calculations @xcite of the @xmath27 transition form factors up to @xmath28 give small negative values for the ratio @xmath20 .",
    "all these results provide strong evidence that the observed small value of @xmath20 has a purely nonperturbative origin .",
    "this is why we think that the application of the holographic qcd may shed more light on our understanding of this phenomenon , as it captures both nonperturbative and large @xmath0 features .",
    "some of the reviews describing various aspects of the @xmath11 transition can be found in @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we briefly review the holographic model proposed by sakai and sugimoto @xcite , and discuss how baryons are described in the model . instead of going into the details of this construction that are well described in refs .",
    "@xcite , we only outline the five - dimensional effective action that emerges from the model and the field decomposition which are of importance for our further discussions .",
    "we then review the primary results in ref .",
    "@xcite , where nucleons and delta baryons as well as their interactions with the vector mesons are studied within the nonrelativistic formalism .",
    "this will be our starting point of the subsequent analysis . in sec .  3",
    ", we explore the holographic vector meson dominance feature that emerges from the holographic qcd . in the origin of this",
    "lies the observation that there exists a basis for the vector meson fields in which the external electromagnetic field interacts only with vector meson fields , linearly without kinetic mixing . as a result",
    ", we end up with a very convenient framework to perform tree - level calculations . in sec .  4 , we outline similar approaches for describing baryons in the sakai - sugimoto model ( other than ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for completeness",
    ", we also study and compare the dependence of some of the main results , when applying these alternative approaches .    in sec .  5",
    ", we propose a relativistic generalization for the @xmath29 vertex that is required to obtain relativistic transition form factors .",
    "since our purpose is to perform tree level calculations , we avoid all problems associated with the higher - spin fermions . without concerning what is the appropriate 5d relativistic formulation for the spin-@xmath30 fermions",
    ", we simply explore the expectation that after integrating over the holographic 5th direction @xmath31 , the theory should effectively become a 4d relativistic theory of spin-@xmath30 particles , for which rarita - schwinger formalism can be implemented .",
    "this in turn should reduce to a nonrelativistic theory with @xmath32 vertex that we started with . by considering all possible relativistic operators consistent with 4d symmetries ,",
    "we eventually find a unique relativistic operator which satisfies these requirements , and write down a 4d relativistic lagrangian that correctly describes the @xmath32 vertices , up to possible subleading terms of order @xmath33 .    in sec .  6 , after giving a general formalism for the interaction vertex and defining the relevant form factors ,",
    "together with their ratios that are of importance in comparison with experiments , we present our results for the @xmath16 transition form factors from the holographic qcd .",
    "we observe that magnetic dipole , electric , and coulomb quadrupole form factors all depend on a single _ holographic form factor_. similar observation was also made in ref.@xcite .",
    "this leads to interesting consequences that are in accord with the expected behavior in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we also briefly discuss some other observables of interest .",
    "we conclude by summarizing our results and pointing out some directions for further development .",
    "we briefly outline the holographic model proposed by sakai and sugimoto in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to establish our notations and conventions that we are going to use throughout this paper .",

    "geometrically , the chiral @xmath44 symmetry of qcd is spontaneously broken to the diagonal subgroup @xmath45 due to the `` merging '' of these @xmath35 and @xmath36 branes in the background of @xmath38-branes . in simple terms , the resulting configuration can be viewed as a stack of @xmath34 @xmath35-branes continuously connecting asymptotic regions of the original @xmath35 and @xmath36 branes .",

    "the theory has a unique scale @xmath68 , the popular choice of which is @xmath69  gev , chosen to reproduce the experimental @xmath70-meson mass .",
    "besides mesons , the present holographic model is also able to incorporate baryons , which appear in a way quite similar to the skyrmion in 4d @xcite . in the holographic 5d theory ( [ 5dtheory ] ) , we have topological solitons along the _ spatial _ euclidean four dimensions @xmath71 , whose topological charges are determined by the second chern number of the gauge potential b=18 ^ 2_r^3ztr(ff ) .[topcharge ] in fact this topological charge is related to the usual skyrmion number of pions upon 4d interpretation ( [ mode ] ) , which supports the identification of these solitons as baryons @xcite .    as the energy of the baryon",
    "is minimized at @xmath72 , due to the specific form of the action ( [ 5dtheory ] ) , it localizes at this position .",
    "in fact , the size of this soliton baryon naively tends to shrink to zero by the same reason . from the gauge - kinetic action ( [ 5dtheory ] )",
    ", it follows that the mass of the soliton ( @xmath73 ) with @xmath74 , which is localized at @xmath72 and has zero size would be m_b^0 = 4 ^ 2   ( ) ^2 m_kk  .",
    "[ zeromass]if the size of the soliton is perturbed by @xmath70 , then the increase in mass is @xmath75 .",
    "this suggests that it would be energetically more favorable for the soliton to stay localized at @xmath72 with zero size .",
    "however , the presence of the 5d chern - simons term ( [ cs5d ] ) induces an additional electric charge to the topological charge ( [ topcharge ] ) , whose electrostatic self - energy ( @xmath76 ) compensates the shrinking tendency . as a result , the baryon acquires a stable and finite size @xcite .",
    "note that the soliton profile should be much like the profile of the instanton in yang - mills theory , since the equations that describe this soliton are similar to those of the euclidean 4d ym theory , except a nontrivial form of the action ( [ 5dtheory ] ) .",
    "the soliton solutions come with a moduli space of zero modes , just like in case of the skyrmions , and one should quantize along this moduli space .",
    "the structure of the moduli space can be easily learned from that of the instantons : we have approximate @xmath77 spatial rotations interlocked with the isospin @xmath78 in addition to the usual translational moduli .",
    "size is not a moduli due to the non - trivial @xmath31 dependence of the metric , but one can also choose to quantize along the size as in ref .",
    "@xcite . as a result ,",
    "one gets nucleons as lowest states of the spectrum , @xmath2 baryons as a next excitation , and other higher excited baryon states .",
    "one of the important lessons we learn from the well - known ym instanton solution is its purely non - abelian nature in the field profile with the @xmath79 part being absent .",
    "another lesson is that the profile has a long - ranged tail at large distance @xmath80 of the form a_m^a ~-^2|^a_mn_n1r^2,[tail ] where @xmath70 is the stabilized size of the soliton baryon .",
    "this can provide important information about the coupling of baryons with the mesons , more precisely with the 5d gauge field @xmath81 at the position of the soliton @xmath72 .",
    "this is essentially in the same vein to the usual pion tail of the skyrmion solution , whose strength was used by adkins - nappi - witten to obtain the nucleon - pion coupling @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "recall that the logic was to replace the _",
    "quantized _ skyrmions with a pointlike nucleon field @xmath83 that has a coupling to the pions with the right strength @xmath82 to source the asymptotic pion tail of the original skyrmion solution .",
    "one subtlety was that the pion tail of the classical skyrmion solution must be replaced by the expectation value of _ quantum _ states obtained by semiclassical quantization along the zero modes .",
    "only after that it can be mapped to the profile sourced by the nucleon current @xmath84 in the _ nonrelativistic _ limit . also , the quantization of skyrmion results in a tower of higher half - integer spin and isospin states as well , with @xmath2 baryons of spin and isospin @xmath30 being a primary example . through the identical procedure as for nucleons , it was also possible to calculate nucleon-@xmath2-pion coupling @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "the same logic may be invoked to find a coupling of _ quantized _ holographic baryons in 5d to gauge field @xmath55 that encodes pions and a tower of spin-1 vector mesons via ( [ mode ] ) .",
    "in other words , the coupling of the baryon field to the 5d gauge field @xmath56 must be such to be able to reproduce _ quantum state expectation value _ of the long - ranged tail ( [ tail ] ) of the original soliton solution for the baryon .",
    "the necessary semiclassical quantization on the zero modes is essentially identical to that of the skyrmion , giving us a tower of _ nonrelativistic _ spectrum of half - integer spin and isospin . by computing expectation values of the long - range tail ( [ tail ] ) over these states , one may write down effective local couplings of baryon fields to the field @xmath56 that can reproduce these quantum averaged tails .",
    "an important point is that these couplings will involve only the non - abelian part of @xmath56 as the abelian @xmath79 component is absent in the tail ( [ tail ] ) .",
    "for the lowest spin , isospin @xmath86 states corresponding to a holographic version of the usual nucleons , refs .",
    "@xcite introduced a 5d dirac spinor @xmath87 to write down an effective lagrangian that encapsulates the above features .",
    "the necessary analysis for higher excited baryons was done in ref .",

    "we summarize some of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which will be our starting point in calculating the transition form factors .",

    "although , the value of the @xmath270 form factor remain the same for both models , we seem to get a better agreement with experimental data for energies up to @xmath285 .",

    "our most reliable results in this work are the values for the form factors obtained at @xmath212 .",
    "an interesting direction for further studies includes the possibility for studying transition form factors among various other excited hadron states .",
