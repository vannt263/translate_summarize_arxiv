    "the challenge of understanding atomic spectra has opened a new era in atomic physics since 1913 , when niels bohr suggested that such spectra , e.g. , beautiful lines with rainbow colors , were rays emitted by an electron deexciting from one orbit to a lower - energy one , and hence corresponded to transitions between two states of the atom .",
    "atomic spectroscopy thus includes the determination of the states of the atom and of their properties which are determined by the associated wavefunctions .",
    "similarly , nuclear spectroscopy began in the 1950s with the aim of determining the various states of a nucleus and their properties .",
    "however , the experimental spectra of nuclei exhibit much more complexity than those of atoms because the interactions binding the nucleons are more complicated and the external coulomb potential producing the spherical shell structure in atoms is missing in nuclei . on the way to understanding at least the basic features of the observed nuclear spectra , two seemingly contradictory models coexist which are equally successful . on one hand , the liquid drop model describes the nucleus as a whole and the observed nuclear spectra are understood as associated with collective vibrations and/or rotations . on the other , the shell model by mayer and jensen _ et al _ treats the nucleus as a composite of individual nucleons and describes the observed nuclear spectra from nucleon excitations .",
    "both models emphasize either the collective or the individual character but ignore the other .",
    "combining the single - particle and collective models , for instance , couples one or a few particles to a collective rotor or vibrator , leads to the so - called `` unified model '' introduced by bohr and mottelson  @xcite .",
    "as the book of bohr and mottelson  @xcite demonstrated , `` quantal rotation '' has been a very successful concept in describing rotational spectra of nuclei .",
    "the nucleus is considered as a quantum charged liquid drop , which can be deformed as a result of its shell structure .",
    "the deformed nuclear density distribution specifies a space orientation and , thus , provides the rotational degree of freedom .",
    "different rotational bands in a given nucleus correspond to collective rotation originating from different combinations of single nucleon states in the deformed potential . according to quantum mechanics",
    ", there is no rotation around the symmetry axis and , therefore , there are no rotational bands in spherical nuclei .    it has been generally accepted that the nuclear high angular momenta are connected with collective rotation modes associated with stable nuclear deformation  @xcite . for quadrupole deformed nucleus with axial symmetry ,",
    "many nucleons may collectively rotates around an axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the nuclear density distribution .",
    "the corresponding rotational states are usually connected with strong electric quadrupole ( @xmath3 ) transitions .",
    "the concept of such collective rotation successfully explains many rotational bands observed .",
    "it has also stimulated the discoveries and observation of many exciting phenomena in rapidly rotating nuclei during the past decades , such as backbending  @xcite , angular momentum alignment  @xcite , superdeformation  @xcite , etc .    in the 1990s , the rotational - like states with significant @xmath4 transitions in near - spherical pb isotopes",
    "was observed , which was a surprise at that time .",
    "experimental investigations of this novel type of collective bands with strong @xmath4 and weak @xmath3 transitions in near spherical nuclei have attracted a lot of attention ( for reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . due to the weak @xmath3 transitions ,",
    "nuclear deformation should play only a minor role in generating such rotational states . instead",
    ", it was found that the dynamics of valence nucleons in high-@xmath5 orbitals is responsible for such rotational structure  @xcite .",
    "such bands were explained in terms of the shears mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the valence proton holes ( particles ) and neutron particles ( holes ) in high-@xmath5 orbitals generates considerable magnetic moment .",
    "this magnetic moment specifies a certain orientation in space and , through its rotation , a series of excited states of rotational character can be built ; see fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 1 ] for a schematic illustration . at the bandhead ,",
    "the neutron particle and proton hole usually tend to align along nearly perpendicular directions to lower the total energy of the system . when the rotational frequency increases , they start to align towards each other to generate angular momentum , while the total angular momentum barely changes its orientation in the intrinsic frame . as a result , the so - called `` magnetic rotation '' ( mr )  @xcite bands are formed although the density of the system is only weakly deformed . in magnetic rotation",
    ", the order parameter which violates rotational symmetry is the magnetic moment  @xcite .",
    "this is quite different from collective rotation in well - deformed nuclei ( called electric rotation ) , where rotational symmetry breaking is induced by the electric quadrupole moments",
    ". however , magnetic rotation in nuclei constitutes an analogy with a ferromagnet in condensed matter , where the isotropy is also violated by the total magnetic moment , i.e. , the sum of the atomic dipole moments . for more detailed discussions ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .     and",
    "neutron - particle @xmath6 , both in high-@xmath5 orbitals , gives the total angular momentum @xmath7 .",
    "as a result , a significant transverse component of the magnetic dipole moment @xmath8 appears and creates strong @xmath4 transitions . taken from ref .",
    "[ fig1 - 1 ] ]    apart from the ferromagnetism , the antiferromagnetism is another very interesting phenomenon in condensed matter . unlike the existence of a significant total magnetic moment in a ferromagnet , in an antiferromagnet",
    ", the total magnetic moment vanishes .",
    "however , for the latter , all the atomic dipole moments equally align in two opposite directions and , thus , the corresponding isotropy is also violated .    in an analogy to the antiferromagnet in condensed matter , in nuclear physics",
    ", antimagnetic rotation ( amr )  @xcite has also attracted a lot of interests in the past decades .",
    "similar to mr , amr can also be observed in weakly deformed nuclei , and the valence nucleons in high-@xmath5 orbitals also play a crucial role in the rotational structure . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 2 ] , the high-@xmath5 neutron particles have their angular momenta aligned in one direction , and the two high-@xmath5 proton holes align oppositely along the vertical direction . such an arrangement is usually necessary to achieve the most favored state in energy at the bandhead . due to the weak deformation , rotational symmetry is violated by the angular momenta of valence nucleons .",
    "therefore , excitations of rotational character can be built on such a bandhead . within this band , the two proton ( neutron ) blades",
    "simultaneously move towards the neutron ( proton ) angular momentum vector .",
    "this is the so - called `` two shears - like mechanism '' which generates the total angular momentum . in this way",
    ", amr provides a new mode of rotation in weakly deformed nuclei , where valence - nucleon dynamics plays an important role .",
    "transitions appear . taken from ref .",
    "[ fig1 - 2 ] ]    both mr and amr  @xcite can happen in a nearly spherical nucleus .",
    "since the early 1990s , a lot of effort has been made to measure mr and amr bands in experiments .",
    "in particular , the lifetime measurements with high accuracy for four @xmath4 bands in @xmath9 performed with gammasphere provided clear evidences for the shears mechanism  @xcite . since then , a number of mr bands have been observed in the mass regions with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . as summarized in a recent review  @xcite , more than 195 magnetic dipole bands have now been observed in 85 nuclei when counting up to the year 2013 .    just like the mr bands",
    ", amr sequences are expected to be observed in the nearly spherical nuclei as well  @xcite .",
    "therefore , candidates for amr bands , in principle , are located in the same mass regions as those for mr bands .",
    "in fact , it has been demonstrated that the mr and amr modes can coexist in a single nucleus  @xcite .",
    "however , an amr band differs from a mr one in two aspects .",
    "first , no @xmath4 transition appears in an amr band , since the net transverse component of the total magnetic moment is zero .",
    "second , the spin differences between neighboring energy levels in an amr band are @xmath15 rather than @xmath16 as in the case in a mr band . this is because an antimagnetic rotor is invariant under a rotation by @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , amr bands have the feature that the @xmath18 values are decreasing with spin , and this has been confirmed by lifetime measurements  @xcite . to date , most amr bands are observed in the mass regions with @xmath12 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) and , only very recently , have they also been reported in the @xmath13 region  @xcite .    because it had generally been accepted for a long time that nuclear rotation is a collective phenomenon and",
    "is associated with substantial deformation , the observation of magnetic rotation brought significant challenges to nuclear theory .",
    "for a full understanding of nuclear rotation , one has to solve , in principle , the time - dependent nuclear many - body problem in a microscopic way , and introduce approximations for simple physics pictures in extreme cases .",
    "although such microscopic theories are extremely useful , they usually require a great amount of numerical effort .",
    "mean - field theory is one of such widely used approaches for a microscopic description of nuclear structure . for conventional rotational bands ,",
    "the cranking mean - field model  @xcite is a reliable method since it is a first - order approximation for a variation after projection onto good angular momentum  @xcite .    for conventional rotations ,",
    "the axis in the cranking mean - field model is parallel with the principal axis of the nuclear density distribution with the largest moment of inertia .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that a good description of mr bands requires the cranking axis tilted away from the principal axes .",
    "this leads to the so - called _ tilted axis cranking _ ( tac ) model .",
    "the mean - field solutions of tilted axis rotation were studied in the 1980s  @xcite . however ,",
    "the physics behind these solutions was missing , and the nuclear deformation was not considered in a self - consistent way in these solutions . by using a quadrupole - quadrupole ( qq ) hamiltonian ,",
    "the tac model was solved self - consistently for the first time by frauendorf in 1993  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was found that the obtained solutions can account for the @xmath19 rotational bands . later on ,",
    "the quality of the tac approximation was investigated in comparison with the quantum particle rotor model by frauendorf and meng  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the calculated energies and electromagnetic transitions with tac approach can reproduce the results of the particle rotor model quite well , except near band crossings .",
    "the tac solutions for triaxial nuclei have attracted considerable attentions in nuclear physics .",
    "different from an axial nucleus which has one principal axis as a symmetry axis , none of the three principal axes of a triaxial nucleus is a symmetry axis .",
    "this indicates that rotational excitations in principle could be built along any principle axes of a triaxial nucleus .",
    "usually , a triaxial rigid rotor would favor in energy to rotate around the axis with the largest moment of inertia ( moi ) .",
    "however , for nuclear systems , besides the `` rigid core '' , valence nucleon(s ) in high-@xmath5 orbitals may contribute angular momentum in other two axes regardless of their collective moment of inertia .",
    "therefore , one may finally observe a rotation along an arbitrary axis in space for triaxial nuclei .",
    "such rotation should be described in the framework of cranking mean field as three - dimensional tac solution , which is associated with the exotic phenomenon of nuclear chirality  @xcite .",
    "the term `` chiral '' was first used by lord kelvin  @xcite , `` i call any geometrical figure , or group of points , ` chiral ' , and say that it has chirality if its image in a plane mirror , ideally realized , can not be brought to coincide with itself '' .",
    "static chiral symmetries are very common in nature ranging from the macroscopic spirals of snail shells to the microscopic handedness of certain molecules .",
    "in particular , the spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking has become one of the most general concepts in modern physics including particle physics , condensed matter physics , and optics",
    ".     represents the total angular momentum of the nucleus , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 the angular momenta of the odd - proton , odd - neutron and collective core , respectively . here",
    "the 2 axis indicates the intermediate axis , while the 1 and 3 axes expand the short - long plane of the triaxial nucleus . taken from ref .",
    "[ fig1 - 3 ] ]    the existence of spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking was originally introduced in nuclear physics by frauendorf and meng in ref .",
    "@xcite , where they have investigated the rotational excited states in triaxial odd - odd nuclei .",
    "[ fig1 - 3 ] schematically depicts the chiral geometry in such a nucleus .",
    "the angular momentum of the triaxial core @xmath23 can align along the intermediate axis since this axis has the largest moment of inertia in the irrotational - like flow .",
    "however , the angular momenta of the two valence odd nucleons can be mutually perpendicular in the short - long plane , if they are respectively of a particle- and hole - like nature . in this way , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 3 ] , these three angular momenta form two systems , i.e. , the left- and right - handed systems .",
    "they are different from each other by their intrinsic chirality and , thus , related by the chiral operator @xmath24 . here",
    "@xmath25 denotes the time reversal and @xmath26 spatial rotation by @xmath17 .",
    "the broken chiral symmetry in the intrinsic frame should be restored in the laboratory frame .",
    "this gives rise to the so - called _ chiral doublet bands _ , which consists a pair of nearly degenerate @xmath27 bands with the same parity .",
    "experimentally , candidate chiral doublet bands have been proposed in a number of odd - odd , odd-@xmath28 or even - even nuclei in the @xmath11 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath14 regions .",

    "the appearance of chiral doublet bands is one of the most important probes for the existence of nuclear triaxiality . along this line ,",
    "the phenomenon of multiple chiral doublet bands ( m@xmath0d ) introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , more than one pair of such bands is presented in a single nucleus , corresponds to triaxial shape coexistence since every pair differs from others in its triaxial deformation and multiparticle configuration .",
    "the existence of m@xmath0d was demonstrated for the rh isotopes by cdft in refs .",
    "the likelihood of chiral bands with different configurations was also discussed in the tac calculations for the bands observed in @xmath35rh  @xcite .",

    "it was found that the negative parity bands 5 and 6 with a @xmath36 configuration and the positive parity bands 2 and 3 with the @xmath37 \\otimes \\nu(1h_{11/2})^{-1}$ ] configuration form two pairs of chiral doublet bands . obviously , these are two distinct chiral doublet bands due to their different parity .",

    "the angular momentum vector moves along the heavy arc , and the position displayed corresponds to the spin interval @xmath40 , where the two lowest bands are nearly degenerate .",
    "taken from ref .",
    "[ fig1 - 4 ] ]    apart from the m@xmath0d with distinct configurations , it is also very interesting to study the robustness of the chiral geometry against the intrinsic excitation . as an example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , frauendorf and meng studied a system of a high-@xmath5 particle and a high-@xmath5 hole coupled to a triaxial rotor .",
    "as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 - 4 ] , as a consequence of the chiral geometry , the two lowest bands are nearly degenerate within the spin interval @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , based on the same chiral configuration , one can see that such near degeneracy also occurs for the higher excited bands in certain spin intervals .",
    "this indicates that a chiral geometry may remain in these excited bands as well .",

    "such predictions have also been confirmed in a recent experiment for @xmath2rh  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the tac mean - field model is one of the most successful models for the description of nuclear rotation .",
    "the tilted axis cranking solution and the physics behind it were first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and later discussed thoroughly with the pairing - plus - quadrupole model and the strutinsky shell - correction model  @xcite .",
    "so far , many applications have been performed with these models .",
    "self - consistent methods based on more realistic two - body interactions are required for a more fundamental investigation , including all important effects such as core polarization and nuclear currents  @xcite .",

    "focusing on magnetic rotational bands , the two - dimensional cranking cdft with the meson - exchange interaction has been established in ref .",
    "@xcite . compared with three - dimensional cranking cdft ,",
    "the two - dimensional cranking cdft reduced the computing time considerably and , thus , allows its application for medium heavy nucleus such as @xmath41gd  @xcite .",
    "the point - coupling cdft has become very popular recently due to the following advantages : 1 ) it avoids the possible physical constraints introduced by using explicitly the klein - gordon equation , in particular the fictitious @xmath43 meson ; 2 ) the study on the naturalness of the interaction  @xcite in effective theories becomes possible for related nuclear structure problems ; 3 ) it is easier to include the fock terms  @xcite and to investigate its relationship to the nonrelativistic ones  @xcite .    in ref .",

    "finally , a summary and perspectives are given in section  [ sect.04 ] .",
    "the occurrence of the magic numbers 2 , 8 , 20 , 28 , 50 , @xmath47 in nuclei has been one of the strongest evidences for the validity of an average mean field in which the nucleons can move independently  @xcite . for the nucleons in a nucleus , although there exist a priori no such central field , one can build such an average potential from the interactions among all nucleons in the nucleus . a model with such",
    "an average potential treats the nucleons as completely independent moving ones . in practical applications , an analytic ansatz for the average potential which is determined by fitting the experimental single - particle levels",
    "is widely used for simplicity . in principle , however , one can derive the form of such an average field from a microscopic two - body nucleon - nucleon force by means of the hartree - fock method , for example see ref .",
    "@xcite . even starting with a phenomenological nucleon - nucleon interactions , the derived hartree - fock potentials are very important to justify the analytic potentials ansatz and to test different approximations and assumptions adopted .",
    "the woods - saxon potential is one of the most successful mean field potential , @xmath48^{-1}.\\ ] ] here , one has to allow for a small dependence of @xmath49 on the angles @xmath50 and @xmath51 in order to get a constant surface diffuseness for deformed nuclei ( for more details , see ref .",
    "moreover , one needs to consider the spin - orbit term since it plays a very important role for the level structure of nuclei , @xmath52 in general , the involved parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 , as well as the expressions of the parameterized @xmath55 and @xmath49 , are determined by directly fitting to the experimental single - particles levels .",
    "another useful approximation to the average potential is the modified harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "such study was originally carried out by nilsson  @xcite with the deformed harmonic oscillator hamiltonian , @xmath56 where @xmath57 gives the strength of the spin - orbit force , and @xmath58 shifts the levels with higher @xmath59-values downward to achieve better agreement with experimental single - particle spectra term introduced since the original version was proposed . ] .    the models with an analytic average potential work quite successfully in describing the single - particle properties of nuclei .",
    "however , in contrast to hartree - fock calculations , they fail to correctly reproduce the bulk properties to which all nucleons contribute , such as the total binding energy .",
    "strutinsky  @xcite invented a very elegant method , the strutinsky shell correction approach , in which the quantal description of the phenomenological average potential is combined with the macroscopic description with the liquid drop model ( ldm ) .",
    "this method is regarded as a major leap forward for the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "it is able to reproduce not only the experimental ground states energies of nuclei , but also their dependence on deformation parameters .    in the strutinsky method ,",
    "one calculates the total energy as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a smooth part well represented by the liquid drop model , and @xmath62 is the quantal shell correction energy due to the occurrence of shell closures , @xmath63 with @xmath64 the single - particle energy of the state @xmath65 , and @xmath66 the smooth strutinsky energy .",
    "the strutinsky method to calculate the quantal part @xmath62 can be found in many textbooks , e.g. , in ref .",
    "the applications of the strutinsky shell correction method in calculating the nuclear masses and/or the energy potential surface with respect to the deformation can be found in many references , for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "apart from the strutinsky shell correction model , another model , the _ pairing - plus - quadrupole model _ , has also been widely used due to its simplicity ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this model",
    ", one assumes a simple pairing - plus - quadrupole hamiltonian which has the form , @xmath67 with the quadrupole operator , @xmath68 and the creation operator for a cooper pair , @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the time reversed state of @xmath71",
    ". the strengths of the force @xmath0 and @xmath72 depend on the configuration space under consideration and are determined by the experimental data .",
    "with such a pairing - plus - quadrupole hamiltonian , one can prove that the solution of the resulting hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) equations just corresponds to a nilsson diagonalization with variable deformation parameters related to @xmath0 , a subsequent bcs calculation with constant gap parameter related to @xmath72 , and a minimization of the total energy ( for more details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the pairing - plus - quadrupole model explains the nilsson model with bcs approximation very well .",
    "however , it is only a model which contains several key and gross features of a realistic nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "more realistic and fundamental approach to derive a self - consistent mean field from a microscopic nucleon - nucleon force is highly demanded .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking is one of the most basic features of the self - consistent mean - field method . in the relativistic case , so far , most covariant density functional theories are carried out with a mean - field approximation and , thus , the spontaneous symmetry breaking also plays a very important role . in the following , the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the covariant density functional theory will be explained .",
    "the classic version of the covariant density functional theory is the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model developed by walecka and serot in 1970s  @xcite . in the earlier rmf models ,",
    "a nucleus is regarded as a composition of a certain number of dirac nucleons .",
    "the interaction between two nucleons is conveyed by exchanging mesons . at the very beginning , only the scalar @xmath43 meson and vector @xmath73 meson",
    "are considered .",
    "such a simple scheme has already been able to describe several important features of nuclear structure , e.g. , nuclear saturation and strong spin - orbit interaction . since then , rmf models have been further improved in many aspects by many groups , and also been applied to describe many properties of both stable and exotic nuclei  @xcite . for a satisfied description of nuclear bulk and single - particle properties , the isovector - vector @xmath74 meson was included in addition to the @xmath43 and @xmath73 mesons .",
    "moreover , nonlinear meson self - interactions , which are associated with medium dependences of the effective interactions , were found to be important to achieve a quantitative description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "an alternative way to include such medium dependences is to explicitly assume that the meson - nucleon couplings changes with the nucleon densities .",
    "more details on the meson - exchange versions of cdft can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the successful rmf models can also been reformulated in the framework of kohn - sham density functional theory , which is widely used in the treatment of many - body problems , in particular for coulombic systems . in the framework of density functional theory ,",
    "all the observables in principle can be calculated through nucleon density .",
    "therefore , it is very convenient to build the relativistic energy density functionals based on a point - coupling interaction  @xcite by eliminating the meson degrees of freedom . specifically , one can replace an exchanged meson by a contact interaction between nucleons in every channel of the interaction , e.g. , the scalar , vector , and isovector channels .",

    "an important feature of an amr rotor is that the system is symmetric under a rotation around the rotation axis by an angle of @xmath17 .",
    "this means that the rotational axis must not be tilted , but parallel with one of the principal axes . in principle",

    "[ fig4 - 1 ] , the total routhians are shown as functions of the tilted angle @xmath211 .",
    "it is very clear that the total routhians for various rotational frequencies always have their mimima at @xmath213 , which means that the rotational axis of antimagnetic rotation is the @xmath133 axis .",

    "the nuclear density functionals are usually adjusted to experimental ground state properties or to nuclear matter data , which depend only on time - even parts of the potentials .",
    "therefore , ambiguity for the time - odd part exists in non - relativistic density functionals .",
    "however , in relativistic functionals , the time - odd fields described by the currents , i.e. , the spatial components of the vector fields , have the same coupling constant as the time - like components and do nt require new parameters .",

    ", recent calculations have found that the pairing would influence not only the magnitude of the angular momentum but also its direction  @xcite . due to the time - reversal symmetry broken in rotating nuclei",

    "the most recent progress in this way can be found ref .",

    "moreover , a full description of chiral doublet bands also requires a theory going beyond the mean field approximation to restore the broken chiral symmetry in intrinsic frame . only aplanar cranking calculations can not describe the quantum tunneling between the left - handed and right - handed states in the body - fixed frame and would not yield the chiral partners . the tilted axis cranking model with pairing plus quadrupole hamiltonian has been extended by the random phase approximation  @xcite , but it limits to only the chiral vibration mode .",

    "for instance , a relativistic description for the recently observed nuclear `` tidal waves '' , low - lying collective excitations may be described semiclassically as quadrupole running waves on the surface of the nucleus  @xcite , will be quite helpful to deepen the understanding of this phenomenon . moreover , novel deformation is always associated with novel rotation mode . in a recent study ,",
