    "since general relativity has been proposed , many experiments have been performed to verify the gravitational theory .",
    "most of these attempts are done in the weak gravitational field such as our solar system , but nothing indicates the failure of general relativity .",
    "on the other hand , since the astronomical observations in the strong gravitational field are very poor , the gravitational theory in such a strong - field regime could be still unconstrained .",
    "that is , the gravitational theory to describe the phenomena in the strong - field regime might be different from general relativity , and one might be possible to probe the gravitational theory via the observations of the deviation from general relativity . in practice , up to now there are many suggestions to observationally test the gravitational theory in the strong - field regime @xcite .",
    "the technology is developing more and more , which will enable us to accurately observe the phenomena in the strong - field regime .",
    "these coming new observations might be possible to use as the test of gravitational theory .",
    "so far , a lot of alternative gravitational theories are proposed . among them , scalar - tensor theory is the one of the simplest alternative gravitational theories , which must be a natural extension of standard general relativity @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations to consider scalar - tensor gravity is that this theory can be obtained in the low energy limit of string and/or other gauge theories . in scalar - tensor gravity ,",
    "the scalar field plays an essential role in addition to the usual tensor field in general relativity , where the matter field is described by using the effective metric @xmath0 associated with the scalar and gravitational field , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , via the conformal transformation , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "the brans - dicke theory @xcite is the simplest version of scalar - tensor gravity , where @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 .",
    "the coupling parameter @xmath6 can be associated with the brans - dicke parameter @xmath7 as @xmath8 , which are constrained through the solar system experiments , i.e. , @xmath9 which is corresponding to @xmath10 @xcite . within this restriction on the coupling parameter ,",
    "it is almost impossible to predict a large deviation from general relativity in the strong - field regime .    a different functional form of the conformal factor",
    "is also suggested by damour and esposito - farse @xcite , where @xmath11 . with this type of coupling ,",
    "even if @xmath6 is almost zero , the relativistic stellar models in scalar - tensor gravity can significantly deviate from the predictions in general relativity .",
    "additionally , they found that the stellar models in scalar - tensor gravity suddenly deviate from those in general relativity for the specific values of coupling parameters , which is referred to as _",
    "spontaneous scalarization_. with respect to this phenomenon , harada systematically examined with the technique of catastrophe theory and found that the spontaneous scalarization can happen for @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "recently , it is found that the spontaneous scalarization are possible for larger value of @xmath13 in fast rotating relativistic stars @xcite and in the neutron star binary system @xcite . on the other hand , using the observations of pulsar white dwarf binary , freire _",
    "et al_. set a severe constraint on @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "additionally , it is reported that @xmath13 could be constrained to be larger than @xmath15 , depending on the equation of state @xcite .",
    "maybe , although the constraint on @xmath13 would become severer via the future observations , we focus on the range of @xmath16 in this paper .",
    "the several attempts to observationally distinguish scalar - tensor gravity from general relativity have been already done in the past by using the redshift in the absorption lines of the x and @xmath17 rays emitted from the stellar surface @xcite , the spectrum of the gravitational waves radiated from relativistic stars @xcite , and the rotational effect around compact objects @xcite . in this paper , we consider the different approach , i.e. , the scalar gravitational waves driven by the radial oscillations .",
    "in fact , the gravitational waves can not be excited due to the radial oscillations in general relativity .",
    "this means that the detection of scalar gravitational waves itself becomes the proof the existence of scalar field . from the observational point of view , if the scalar gravitational waves exist , one could in principle identify the scalar gravitational waves with more than three gravitational wave detectors , because we have only three degrees of polarizations in scalar - tensor gravity , such as two usual tensor gravitational waves and scalar gravitational wave .",
    "in fact , we expect that five gravitational wave detectors will be in operation in the future , such as two advanced ligos @xcite , advanced virgo @xcite , kagra @xcite , and indigo @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the method how to separate and reconstruct an arbitrary number of polarization modes by using the observational data by multiple interferometric gravitational wave detectors , is also developing , which is a model - independent approach @xcite .",
    "it should be notices that the scalar gravitational waves in physical frame are proportional to the cosmological value of scalar field @xcite , whose value must be quite small .",
    "that is , if the scalar gravitational waves exist , they might be quite weak and difficult to detect in the current gravitational wave detectors .",
    "the radial oscillations of relativistic stars in general relativity have been examined since early times @xcite in the context of the stability analysis . meanwhile ,",
    "the scalar gravitational waves in scalar - tensor gravity are also examined in the black hole formation due to the dust collapse @xcite and the test particle around a kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "anyway , this is the first time to calculate the scalar gravitational waves driven by the stellar radial oscillations in scalar - tensor gravity suggested by damour and esposito - farse @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we will derive the perturbation equations of radial oscillations and make numerical calculations to examine it .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we briefly mention the equilibrium of nonrotating relativistic stars in scalar - tensor gravity . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] , we derive the perturbation equations describing the radial oscillations of relativistic stars in scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "the numerical results are shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] , where the specific frequencies are determined with the mode analysis and the direct time evolution .",
    "then , we make a conclusion in sec . [",
    "sec : v ] .",
    "we adopt the geometric units , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively , and use the metric signature is @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , in this paper , we consider the neutron star models in scalar - tensor theory of gravity with one scalar field .",
    "in fact , this is a natural extension of general relativity , where gravity is mediated not only by a usual tensor field , but also by a massless long - range scalar field . to express such a theory ,",
    "the total action in the einstein frame is given by ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the bare gravitational constant , @xmath23 is the scalar curvature determined by the einstein metric @xmath2 , @xmath1 is the scalar field , and @xmath24 represents collectively all matter fields .",
    "the metric tensor in the einstein frame , @xmath2 , is related to that in the physical frame ( or jordan - fierz frame ) , @xmath0 , as @xmath25 hereafter , in order to clarify the frame , the quantities in the physical frame are denoted by a tilde and those in the einstein frame are denoted by an asterisk .",
    "we remark that the field equations are usually formulated in the einstein frame , but all non - gravitational experiments are observed in the physical frame .",
    "varying the total action @xmath26 , one can get the field equations in the einstein frame for the tensor and scalar fields ; @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the energy - momentum tensor of the fluid in the einstein frame , while @xmath29 denotes the energy - momentum tensor of the massless scalar field , i.e. , @xmath30 @xmath28 is associated with the energy - momentum tensor in physical frame @xmath31 as @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : field2 ] ) , the scalar quantities @xmath33 and @xmath34 are defined as @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath34 obviously relates a scalar field to matter , the theory with @xmath37 exactly reduces to general relativity .",
    "in addition to the field equations , the law of energy - momentum conservation is given as @xmath38 in the physical frame , which is transformed into that in the einstein frame , such as @xmath39 in this paper , we adopt the same form of conformal factor @xmath4 as in damour & esposito - farse @xcite , i.e. , @xmath40 , where @xmath13 is a real number . with this conformal factor , the quantity @xmath34 is expressed as @xmath41 , i.e. , the theory with @xmath42 agrees with general relativity . at last",
    ", we set @xmath43 as the cosmological value of scalar field at infinity .",
    "in particular , we adopt @xmath44 in this paper .",
    "now , we consider the neutron star models in scalar - tensor theory , which are constructed with perfect fluid of cold degenerate matter .",
    "the metric for non - rotating , spherically symmetric neutron star models can be described as @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are functions of @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is associated with the mass function @xmath50 as @xmath51 . with respect to the matter , we assume the perfect fluid ; @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are the four - velocity of fluid , pressure , and total energy density in physical frame .",
    "in particular , the four - velocity of equilibrium neutron star models is given by @xmath56 then , the equilibrium models are determined by integrating the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations in scalar - tensor theory @xcite , assuming the relation between the pressure and energy density , i.e. , eos . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the polytrope eos , @xmath57 , where we especially fix that @xmath58 km@xmath59 and @xmath60 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ns ] , we show the neutron star models in scalar - tensor gravity with @xmath61 ( broken line ) and @xmath62 ( dotted line ) together with the case in general relativity ( solid line ) , where the left and right panels correspond to the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) masses of neutron stars as functions of central density @xmath63 and stellar radius @xmath64 , respectively . additionally , the central values of scalar field are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phic ] as a function of the central density .",
    "we remark that , as mentioned before , the realistic value of @xmath13 might be larger than @xmath15 and one could have a chance to observe the scalarization even with @xmath65 in the rapidly rotating neutron stars and/or in neutron star binaries @xcite .",
    "but , in the case of spherically symmetric stars , one can observe the scalarization only for @xmath66 @xcite , i.e. , the stellar models with for example @xmath67 or @xmath68 are completely equivalent to those in general relativity , where no scalar perturbation is induced by the matter motion .",
    "so , in this paper , we especially consider the stellar models with @xmath62 and @xmath69 to examine the stellar oscillations and induced scalar perturbations .    [",

    "neutron stars are one of the best candidates to probe the gravitational theory in the strong - field regime . in this paper ,",
    "we especially focus on the radial oscillations of neutron stars in scalar - tensor gravity to examine the scalar gravitational waves driven by the matter oscillations .",
    "in fact , the gravitational waves are not excited due to the radial stellar oscillations in general relativity , while one can expect to observe the scalar gravitational waves due to such oscillations in scalar - tensor gravity . for the calculations of the scalar gravitational waves ,",
    "we first derive the perturbation equations for radial oscillations in scalar - tensor gravity . from the equation of system of radial oscillations , we find that the matter oscillations depend only on the background scalar field , independently of the scalar gravitational waves . on the other hand ,",
    "the wave equation of scalar gravitational waves has a source term composed of the matter oscillations .",
    "due to such a specific coupling , we can determine the frequencies of matter radial oscillations by the mode analysis . as a result",
    ", we show that the spontaneous scalarization can be observed even in the radial oscillations , which might enable us to find the imprint of gravitational theory with the help of the other observations such as stellar mass and/or compactness .    additionally , to examine the scalar gravitational waves driven by the matter radial oscillations",
    ", we directly make a numerical simulation of the evolution equations , where we fix the initial energy of matter oscillations to be @xmath70 .",
    "then , we find that the scalar gravitational waves can be excited if the background scalar field exists .",
    "we also find that the total energy radiated by the scalar gravitational waves depends strongly on the background scalar field and the coupling constant @xmath13 , where the massive star has a potential to radiate more energy of scalar gravitational waves .",
    "furthermore , we make the fast fourier transform to see the specific oscillation frequencies of radiated scalar gravitational waves , which are exactly same as the frequencies of matter oscillations . that is , via the observations of scalar gravitational waves , one can extract the frequencies of stellar radial oscillations .",
    "this is an advantage in scalar - tensor gravity , because the radial gravitational waves can not be excited in general relativity as mentioned before .",
    "we remark that one might have another chance to observe an imprint of radial oscillation in the gravitational waves , if radial oscillations are strongly excited , for example in core - collapse supernovae , and those oscillations make nonlinear coupling with nonradial oscillations , where the oscillations with combination frequencies could be excited @xcite .",
    "if so , one might be possible to measure the background scalar field via such nonlinear coupling . in this paper , as a first step , we neglect the effects of the solid crust layer , magnetic fields , and the exotic matter inside the star , which are also important properties of neutron stars .",
    "such effects could bring us the additional information about the stellar properties @xcite , which might make observational constraints in the gravitational theory stronger .",
