    "one of the most important interactions to stabilize the dna and rna macromolecules is the hydrogen bond between pairs of nitrogenous bases .",
    "it promotes a link among the complementary pairs of bases , maintaining the double helix structure . in the dna",
    "the pairs of bases are guanine - cytosine and adenine - thymine ; in the rna the thymine is substituted by uracil , @xcite . in a recent work ,",
    "the hydrogen bonds present in proteins and in smaller molecules were studied by considering the hydrogen quantum confinement in the nh and oh molecular groups , @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we extended the results for the nucleic acids , which present the nh molecular group .",
    "the hydrogen bond is present in various systems , @xcite , and it is classified as a donor - acceptor interaction . from the experimental point of view , it is possible to identify if a particular molecular group is forming an hydrogen bond due to the change in the vibrational spectrum .",
    "this change can be observed by different experimental techniques , as for instance the infrared spectrum analysis .",
    "the main point of this work is to show that the hydrogen bond can be treated as the quantum confinement of the hydrogen , which would change the transitions related to the nh group present in nucleic acids . as usual , the morse potential , @xcite ,",
    "is used to simulate the vibration of the nh molecular group , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the parameters used are the ones found in literature for these groups without the hydrogen interaction , i.e. , without confinement .",
    "the geometrical restrictions due to the hydrogen bonds are obtained from standard experimental results for this kind of systems , @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the energy levels is made through the variational method with test functions obtained from supersymmetric quantum mechanics formalism , sqm .",
    "this procedure has alrealdy been used in different quantum problems , with and without confinement , @xcite-@xcite , including specific studies involving the morse potential , @xcite , which corroborates its applicability in the present case .    in section 2",
    "the adopted model for the hydrogen bonds is presented .",
    "we then present a review of the sqm formalism in section 3 . in section 4 the specific mathematical formalism concerning the morse potential",
    "is developed , including the identification of the wave functions to be used in the variational method .",
    "the numerical results , with the appropriate parameters of the nh group are presented as well as the comparison with the experimental data are in section 5 . in section 6 the conclusions are discussed .",
    "figure 1 shows a schematic model of a hydrogen bonding between the donor atom x and the acceptor atom y , here denoted by x - h@xmath1y .",
    "the hydrogen bond is represented by h@xmath1y and covalent bond is represented by x - h .",
    "the x and y atoms are considered as hard spheres and the hydrogen is treated as a material point , since the electron cloud is shared with the donor and the acceptor atoms . the origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of the atom x. any distance used is computed from this point and it is considered center - to - center . the covalent radius is adopted by the condition of impenetrability of the donor atom x ; the employment of the van der waals radius is justified because it is a measure of the volume excluded by the acceptor atom y , i.e. , the hydrogen can not penetrate this region .",
    "thus , the hydrogen nuclei may oscillate within a region determined between a minimum distance ( @xmath2 ) , given by the covalent radius ( @xmath3 ) of atom x , and a maximum distance ( @xmath4 ) , given by the length of the hydrogen bond ( @xmath5 ) subtracted by the van der waals radius ( @xmath6 ) of the atom y , i.e. : [ xmax ] x_max = l_x y - x_vw     schematic one - dimensional model , where @xmath3 is the covalent radius of the atom donor , @xmath6 is the van der waals radius of the atom and acceptor and @xmath7 is the equilibrium distance of covalent bond .",
    "x is the donor atom and y represents the atom acceptor .",

    "the energy absorbed / emitted is obtained from the difference between the energies of the ground state and the first excited state . since the confined morse potential is non - exactly solvable , the energies of those states evaluated by using the variational method associated to the formalism of sqm .",
    "sqm is a well known algebraic method commonly used to exploit different aspects of non - relativistic quantum mechanical systems .",
    "it is particularly efficient to solve exactly all the quantum potential problems by means of the hamiltonian factorization , thus providing the entire spectrum of wave functions and respective energies and a hierarchy of hamiltonians , all related by the supersymmetric algebra , @xcite .    using the superalgebra , a given hamiltonian @xmath8 , which has the energy @xmath9 and wave function @xmath10 for the lowest state ,",

    "the following realization of the bosonic operators in terms of the superpotential @xmath14 a_1^ = ( + w_1(x ) ) results in the riccati equation [ riccati ] w_1 ^ 2 - d dxw_1= v_1(x ) - e_0^(1 ) and defines the ground state wave function in terms of the superpotential [ eigenfunction ] _ 0^(1 ) ( x ) = n exp ( -_0^x w_1(|x ) d|x ) .",
    "it can be shown that a @xmath15-members hierarchy of hamiltonians can be generated , all related by the superalgebra , @xcite , h_n = a_n^+a_n^- + e_0^(n ) , where a_n^ = ( + w_n(x ) ) with simple relations connecting the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the @xmath15-members , [ psis ] _",

    "the result is , @xcite v_n+1(y ) = ^2 ( e^-2(y - y_eq ) - 2e^-(y - y_eq ) ) + 2n e^-(y - y_eq ) w_n+1(y ) = - e^-(y - y_eq ) + ( - 2n + 12 ) [ non - confined energy ] _ 0^(n+1 ) = -(- 2n + 12)^2 .",
