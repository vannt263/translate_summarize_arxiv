    "indeed , the corresponding @xmath2-@xmath3 exchange energy is 392  mev in the case of free mn@xmath8 ions,@xcite and in a dms it is a subject of up to twofold reduction by a covalent admixture of the anion @xmath2-type wave function to the kohn - luttinger amplitude at the conduction - band edge . in accord to this insight , @xmath9  ev results from _ ab initio _",
    "computations for @xmath1-(ga , mn)as.@xcite    surprisingly , the recent comprehensive studies of quantum wells of highly dilute paramagnetic @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) suggest _ antiferromagnetic _ @xmath12 ( refs .   and  ) or @xmath13 ( ref .  ) for photoelectrons at the band edge .",
    "these observations have not been explained by the recent theory,@xcite and appear to challenge the time - honored notion that the spin - dependent coupling between the electrons and mn spins in a tetrahedrally coordinated dms originates from the necessarily ferromagnetic intra - atomic potential @xmath2-@xmath3 exchange .",
    "the starting point of our approach is the realization that the density of mn acceptors in the studied@xcite quantum wells of gaas was more than one order of magnitude lower than the critical value corresponding to the insulator - to - metal transition and the onset of the hole - mediated ferromagnetism in this system .",
    "furthermore , a relatively high growth temperature resulted in a small concentration of compensating defects .",
    "accordingly , the conduction - band photoelectrons interacted with complexes consisting of both mn and hole spin , @xmath14 , which are bound by the electrostatic potential and mutually coupled by a strong antiferromagnetic @xmath0-@xmath3 exchange interaction .",
    "we develop here theory of the exchange interaction for such a case and show that it explains , with no adjustable parameters , the sign reversal of the apparent @xmath2-@xmath3 exchange integral .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that an assumption about the heating of the mn spin subsystem , invoked in order to describe the observed dependence of electron spin splitting on the magnetic field,@xcite can be relaxed within the present theory .    independently , much reduced spin splitting has been found for electrons injected to inas quantum dots containing a neutral mn acceptor.@xcite",
    "this observation is consistent with the invoked here mutual cancelation of the @xmath2-@xmath3 and @xmath2-@xmath0 exchange energies .",
    "another case where the presence of bound holes is of primary importance is the bir - aronov - pikus relaxation of electron spins .",

    "vi we examine the effect of compensation on the magnitude of the apparent @xmath2-@xmath3 exchange integral .",
    "section vii contains a summary and outlook .",
    "an important aspect of our theory is that the exchange integrals describing the coupling between conduction - band electrons and holes bound to acceptors can be expressed , with no adjustable parameters , by the acceptor envelop functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 as well as by the exchange splitting @xmath18 and the longitudinal - transverse splitting @xmath19 of the bulk free excitons .",
    "the mn acceptor complex can be described within the tight - binding approximation@xcite or in terms of the baldareschi - lipari spherical model as proposed by bhattacharjee and benoit  la guillaume@xcite for gaas : mn and more recently employed to study impurity band effects.@xcite we determine within this model how polarizations of a mn spin @xmath20 and of a hole total angular momentum @xmath21 depend on the magnetic field @xmath22 and temperature @xmath23 .",
    "we then derive the form and magnitude of the exchange interactions between conduction - band electrons and holes bound by mn acceptors , extracting relevant electron - hole @xmath2-@xmath0 exchange parameters from the previous experimental studies of the free exciton in gaas .",
    "the mn acceptor hamiltonian for the magnetic field along @xmath24 direction reads , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the experimentally determined @xmath0-@xmath3 exchange energy in the mn acceptor,@xcite @xmath27 , and @xmath28 the is hole land factor derived in sec .",

    "iv and v , this interaction is characterized by the @xmath2-@xmath0 exchange energy @xmath37 .",
    "hence , for the expected values of @xmath38 , the @xmath2-@xmath0 exchange dominates over the @xmath2-@xmath3 interaction .",
    "furthermore , because of an antiferromagnetic sign of the @xmath0-@xmath3 exchange interaction , @xmath39 , the apparent coupling between the electron and mn complex is antiferromagnetic . in particular , adopting @xmath40  ev we obtain the field dependence of electron spin splitting shown in fig .  1 .",

    "we recall that the data on the photoelectron precession frequency@xcite were interpreted neglecting the presence of the bound holes @xmath43 as well as by treating both @xmath38 and @xmath23 in the brillouin function @xmath44 for @xmath45 as adjustable parameters.@xcite proceeding in the same way we can describe our theoretical results very well with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , as shown by dashed line in fig .  1 .",
    "we see that the present theory explains why the small antiferromagnetic apparent exchange energy @xmath48 and enhanced temperature @xmath49 were found experimentally.@xcite    it is worth noting that if the contributions of the two terms determining spin splitting compensate each other , the fitted values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 become correlated , so that only their ratio can be determined accurately .",
    "however , this correlation affects little the experimentally determined band - edge value of @xmath50 as it comes from the extrapolation of the data obtained for samples with finite quantum well width , in which the magnitudes of spin splitting are relatively large .",
    "in addition to explaining the magnitude of spin splitting , the large value of the @xmath2-@xmath0 exchange energy @xmath15 implied by our theory elucidates , as demonstrated recently,@xcite why the spin relaxation time in gaas : mn can be by two orders of magnitude longer than that in gaas containing a similar concentration of ge acceptors .    when the bound hole concentration is diminished by donor compensation , the relative importance of the @xmath2-@xmath0 exchange decreases",

    "a substantial reduction in the magnitude of the apparent exchange energy has been found at low mn concentrations , and interpreted as coming from the decrease of the carrier probability density at the core of the magnetic ion caused by the electrostatic repulsion .",
    "it has been suggested that this effect , enhanced by an attractive potential of compensating donors , accounts for reduced values of the exchange spin splitting observed experimentally in compensated iii ",
    "v dmss containing a minute amount of mn.@xcite in view of our findings , the presence of electrostatic potentials associated with magnetic ions makes that the apparent exchange energies should not be viewed as universal but rather dependent on the content of the magnetic constituent and compensating donors ."

    "<S> it is demonstrated that the unusual sign and magnitude of the apparent @xmath2-@xmath3 exchange integral reported for gaas : mn arises from exchange interactions between electrons and holes bound to mn acceptors . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction dominates over the coupling between electrons and mn spins , so far regarded as the main source of spin - dependent phenomena . a reduced magnitude of the apparent @xmath2-@xmath3 exchange integral found in @xmath1-type materials is explained by the presence of repulsive coulomb potentials at ionized mn acceptors and a bottleneck effect . </S>"
