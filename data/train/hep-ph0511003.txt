    "from the particle physics point of view , a wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) looks rather attractive as a candidate for cold dark matter ( cdm ) in the universe . in many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) there often exist several new wimps , and it is often not too difficult to ensure that the lightest of them is stable by means of some discrete symmetry or topological invariant .",
    "( for example , in supersymmetry , one usually invokes @xmath0parity . ) in order to meet stringent astrophysical constraints on exotic relics ( , anomalous nuclei ) , wimps must be electrically and ( preferably ) color neutral .",
    "they can however interact weakly",
    ". for wimps produced via a usual freeze  out from an expanding plasma one finds @xmath1 . assuming a pair  annihilation cross section @xmath2 , and since the relative velocity @xmath3 at freeze  out is non ",
    "relativistic , one often obtains @xmath4 , in agreement with current determinations .",
    "this has sometimes been used as a hint for a deeper connection between weak interactions and cdm in the universe .",
    "contrary to this simple and persuasive argument , cdm particles are not bound to interact with roughly the weak interaction strength . extremely weakly interacting massive particles ( e  wimps )",
    "have also been known to be excellent candidates for cdm . in comparison with `` standard '' wimps , e ",
    "wimp interaction strength with ordinary matter is strongly suppressed by some large mass scale , for example the ( reduced ) planck scale @xmath5 for gravitino or the peccei ",
    "quinn scale @xmath6 for axion and/or axino .",
    "e  wimps are also well motivated from a particle theorist s perspective if one takes the point of view that cdm candidates should appear naturally in some reasonable frameworks beyond the sm which have been invented to address some other major puzzle in particle physics .",
    "in other words , it would be preferable if a cdm candidate were not invented for the sole purpose of solving the dm problem .    .",
    "@xmath7 represents a typical order of magnitude of interaction strength with ordinary matter .",
    "the neutrino provides hot dm which is disfavored .",
    "the box marked ",
    "wimp stands for several possible candidates , , from kaluza  klein scenarios . ]",
    "one way to present well  motivated cdm candidates is to consider a big `` drawing board '' as in fig .",
    "[ bigpic : fig ] : a plane spanned by the mass of the relic on the one side and by a typical strength @xmath8 of its interaction with ordinary matter ( , detectors ) on the other .",
    "to a first approximation the mass range can in principle extend up to the planck mass scale , but not above , if we are talking about elementary particles .",
    "the interaction cross section could reasonably be expected to be of the weak strength ( @xmath9 ) but could also be as tiny as that purely due to gravity : @xmath10 .",
    "what can we put into this vast plane shown in fig .",
    "[ bigpic : fig ] ?",
    "one obvious candidate is the neutrino , since we know that it exists .",
    "neutrino oscillation experiments have basically convinced us that its mass is probably of order @xmath11 , or less . on the upper side , if it were heavier than a few @xmath12 , it would overclose the universe .",
    "the problem is that such a wimp would constitute _ hot _ dm which is hardly anybody s favored these days . while some like it hot , or warm , most like it cold .",
    "the main suspect for today is of course the neutralino @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "while in general it is a mass eigenstate of a bino , wino and two neutral higgsinos , on the grounds of naturalness  @xcite or unification  @xcite it should preferably be mostly a bino .",
    "lep bounds on its mass are actually not too strong , nor robust : they depend on a number of assumptions . in minimal susy ( the so - called mssm ) `` in most cases '' @xmath14 , but the bound can be also much lower .",
    "theoretically , because of the fine tuning argument , one expects its mass to lie in the range of several tens or hundreds of @xmath15  @xcite . more generally , @xmath16 from @xmath17 ( the so  called lee - weinberg bound  @xcite ) and @xmath18 from unitarity  @xcite .",
    "neutralino interaction rates are generally suppressed relative to @xmath19 by various mixing angles in the neutralino couplings . in the mssm",
    "they are typically between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , although could be even lower in more complicated models where the lsp would be dominated for example by a singlino component ( fermionic partner of an additional higgs singlet under the sm gauge group ) .",
    "this uncertainty of the precise nature of the neutralino is reflected in fig .",
    "[ bigpic : fig ] by showing both a smaller ( dark blue ) region of minimal susy and an extended one ( light blue ) with potentially suppressed interaction strengths in non  minimal susy models .",
    "another example of a wimp that would belong to the light blue box is the the lightest kaluza ",
    "klein state which is massive , fairly weakly interacting and stable in some extra  dimensional frameworks  @xcite .",
    "one can see that a typical strength of wimp interactions can be several orders of magnitude less then weak , while still giving @xmath22 .",
    "then we have e  wimps whose interactions are much weaker than electroweak .",
    "well  known example is the axion  a light neutral pseudoscalar particle which is a by  product of the peccei ",
    "quinn solution to the strong cp problem .",
    "its interaction with ordinary matter is suppressed by the pq scale @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , hence extremely tiny , while its mass @xmath25 which gives @xmath26 .",
    "the axion , despite being so light , is of cdm  type because it is produced by the non  thermal process of misalignment in the early universe .    in susy",
    ", the axion has its fermionic superpartner , called axino .",
    "its mass is strongly model  dependent but , in contrast to the neutralino , often not directly determined by the susy breaking scale @xmath27 .",
    "hence the axino could be light and could naturally be the lsp , thus stable .",
    "an earlier study concluded that axinos could be _ warm _ dm with mass less than @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "more recently  @xcite it has been pointed out more massive axinos quite naturally can be also _ cold _ dm as well , as marked in fig .",
    "[ bigpic : fig ] .",
    "lastly , there is the gravitino  the spin@xmath29 superpartner of the graviton  which arises by coupling susy to gravity .",
    "the gravitino relic abundance can be of order one  @xcite but one has to also worry about the so  called gravitino problem : heavier particles decay to gravitinos very late , around @xmath30 after the big bang , and the associated energetic photons and/or hadrons may cause havoc to big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) products .",
    "the problem is not unsurmountable but more conditions / assumptions need to be satisfied as i will discuss below . in fig .",
    "[ bigpic : fig ] the gravitino is marked in the mass range of @xmath31 to @xmath15 and gravitational interactions only , although light gravitinos have actually strongly enhanced couplings via their spin@xmath32 goldstino component .",
    "while fig .",
    "[ bigpic : fig ] is really about wimps which arise in attractive extensions of the sm , it is worth mentioning another class of relics , popularized under the name of wimpzillas , for which there exist robust production mechanisms ( curvature perturbations ) in the early universe  @xcite . as the name suggests ,",
    "they are thought to be very massive , @xmath33 or so .",
    "there are no restrictions on wimpzilla interactions with ordinary matter , as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ bigpic : fig ] .    in summary ,",
    "the number of _ well  motivated _ wimp and wimp  type candidates for cdm is in the end not so large .",
    "one can add to this picture other candidates , but the three candidates for the cdm predicted by susy : the neutralino , the axino and the gravitino are robust .",
    "the neutralino is testable in experimental programmes of this decade ( dm searches and the lhc ) and is therefore of our primary interest but we should not forget about other possibilities .    in this talk , we will discuss two intriguing e  wimps : the axino and the gravitino .",
    "i will demonstrate many similarities they share as well as many cosmological and phenomenological differences which may give one a chance to distinguish them from each other and from the standard neutralino at the lhc .",
    "the axino is a superpartner of the axion .",
    "it is a neutral , @xmath34 , majorana , chiral , spin@xmath32 particle .",
    "there exist several susy and supergravity implementations of the well - known original axion models ( ksvz  @xcite and dfsz  @xcite ) .",
    "( axion / axino - type supermultiplets also arise in superstring models . ) in studying cosmological properties of axinos , we will concentrate on ksvz  type models where the global @xmath35 pq symmetry is spontaneously broken at the pq scale @xmath36 .",
    "a combination of astrophysical ( white dwarfs , ) and cosmological bounds leads to @xmath37@xcite although the upper bound can be significantly relaxed if inflation followed the decoupling of primordial axionic particles and the reheating temperature @xmath38 .",
    "the two main parameters of interest to us are the axino mass and coupling .",
    "the mass @xmath39 strongly depends on an underlying model and can span a wide range , from very small ( @xmath40 ) to large ( @xmath41 ) values .",
    "in contrast to the neutralino ( and the gravitino ) , axino mass does not have to be of the order of the susy breaking scale in the visible sector , @xmath42  @xcite . in a cosmological study of axinos",
    ", we will treat axino mass as a free parameter .",
    "axino couplings to other particles are generically suppressed by @xmath43 . at high temperatures",
    "the most important coupling will be that of an axino  gluino  gluon dimension  five interaction term @xmath44{\\tilde g}^b f^b_{\\mu\\nu } , \\label{eq : axino - gluino - gluon}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 stands for the gluino and @xmath46 for the ksvz ( dfsz ) model . at low temperatures , on the other hand , often a dominant role",
    "will be played by an analogous coupling of axino  photon ",
    "neutralino @xmath47\\bino b_{\\mu\\nu } , \\label{eq : axino - bino - photon}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 denotes the bino , the fermionic partner of the @xmath49 gauge boson @xmath50 , which is one of the components of the neutralino .",
    "depending on a model , there are also terms involving dimension ",
    "four operators coming , , from the _ effective _ superpotential @xmath51 where @xmath52 is one of mssm matter ( super)fields .",
    "axino production processes coming from such terms will be suppressed at high energies relative to processes involving eq .",
    "( [ eq : axino - gluino - gluon ] ) and  ( [ eq : axino - bino - photon ] ) by a factor @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the square of the center of mass energy .",
    "such terms will play an important role in axino production from squark and slepton decays at low temperatures .",
    "[ [ axino - production ] ] axino production + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    because axino interactions are strongly suppressed , their initial thermal population decouples at very high temperatures .",
    "we further assume that it ( and those of other relics , like gravitinos ) present in the early universe was subsequently diluted away by inflation and that @xmath55 .",
    "it also had to be less than @xmath36 , otherwise the pq would have been restored thus leading to the well - known domain wall problem associated with global symmetries .",
    "there are two generic ways of repopulating the universe with axinos .",
    "first , they can be generated through _ thermal production _",
    "( tp ) , via scatterings and decay processes of ordinary particles and sparticles in thermal bath .",
    "second , they may also be produced in decay processes of particles which themselves are out  of  equilibrium , in _ non thermal production _",
    "these production mechanisms will also apply to the gravitino e  wimp .",
    "[ [ thermal - production ] ] thermal production + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the thermal production can be obtained by integrating the boltzmann equation with both scatterings and decays of particles in the plasma .",
    "the main axino production channels are the scatterings of ( s)particles described by a dimension  five axino - gaugino - gauge boson term , eq .",
    "( [ eq : axino - gluino - gluon ] ) .",
    "because of the relative strength of @xmath56 , the most important contributions will come from 2body strongly interacting processes into final states , @xmath57 .",
    "axinos can also be produced through decays of heavier superpartners in thermal plasma . at @xmath58",
    "these are dominated by the decays of gluinos into lsp axinos and gluons . at lower temperatures @xmath59",
    ", neutralino decays to axinos also contribute while at higher temperatures they are sub  dominant . the tp contribution to axino abundance",
    "will be denoted by @xmath60 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ lightelements : table ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bbn+ufb ] the regions excluded by constraints from light element abundances are shown in violet and marked `` bbn '' .",
    "we can see that the neutralino nlsp region is not viable  @xcite while large parts of the stau nlsp domain are , and this is also where the total gravitino relic abundance in the range consistent with wmap . , but still consistent with the gravitino being cold dm , the neutralino region becomes allowed again .",
    "] on the other hand , the ( light green ) region of ntp only is not consistent with bbn .",
    "thus a substantial contribution from tp , and therefore a large enough @xmath61 is required .",
    "on the other hand , increasing @xmath61 causes the green band of @xmath62 to move to the left , which eventually runs into conflict with bbn . in the moderate gravitino mass region",
    "we could find a reheating temperature as high as @xmath63 consistent with all other constraints .",
    "[ [ cmb - constraints ] ] cmb constraints + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the radiative decay process of nlsp releases a net photon energy into the electromagnetic plasma . for late decays ,",
    "number changing interactions , such as thermal bremsstrahlung and double compton scattering , may be ineffective , resulting in a discrepancy with planckian distribution  @xcite .",
    "the observed planckian shape of cmb gives the constraints on the upper bound of a dimensionless chemical potential @xmath64 , @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "for later decays ( @xmath66 ) constraints on cmb can be described by the compton parameter @xmath67 where @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "a magenta line in fig .  [ fig : bbn+ufb ] delineates the region inconsistent with cmb spectrum .",
    "we find that the cmb constraints is usually less stringent than the constraints from the bbn .",
    "[ [ false - vacuua ] ] false vacuua + + + + + + + + + + + +    the presence of scalars with color and electric charge in susy theories induce a possible existence of charge and color breaking ( ccb ) minima . also along some directions in field space",
    "the potential can even become unbounded from below ( ufb ) at tree level .",
    "( after including one loop corrections a ufb direction develops a deep ccb minimum . )",
    "the most dangerous one is the ufb3 direction involving the scalar fields @xmath69 with @xmath70  @xcite . by simple analytical minimization of relevant terms of the scalar potential and requiring @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the minimization scale and @xmath73 is the fermi minimum evaluated at the typical scale of susy masses , one obtains a constraint on the susy parameter space .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig : bbn+ufb ] , regions corresponding to our vacuum being a false vacuum are delineated by a blue line ( on the side of a big arrow ) and marked `` ufb '' .",
    "we can see that the constraint disfavors almost all of the stau nlsp region .",
    "( note that this bound is not specific to the gravitino and applies to the axino case as well . )",
    "however , the existence of such a dangerous global vacuum can not be excluded since the color and electric neutral fermi vacuum which the universe is in may be a long  lived local minimum . in this case",
    "a non - trivial constraints is placed on the inflationary cosmology  @xcite .",
    "e  wimps are well motivated , attractive and intriguing candidates for cdm .",
    "here we have presented two cases of the axino and the gravitino as stable relics and cdm in the universe . in the cmssm , while the neutralino and stau nlsp remain allowed for the axino lsp , for gev gravitino lsp the neutralino nlsp is excluded and only the stau nlsp remains allowed . in the stau region",
    "our vacuum corresponds to a local minimum while in the global one color and/or electric charge are not conserved .",
    "this is one lesson that we can learn should at the lhc a massive , electrically charged particle ( the stau ) be observed as an effectively stable state , rather then the neutralino .",
    "if enough of them were accumulated , one could possibly observe their decays and very different differential event distributions  @xcite could , at least in some cases , allow one to decide whether nature has chosen the axino or the gravitino as a stable relic and cold dark matter in the universe .",
