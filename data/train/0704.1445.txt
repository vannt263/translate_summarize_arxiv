    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum dots attract a great deal of attention as appealing model objects to study the effects of electron - electron ( _ e - e _ ) interaction , which is principally important for 1d electron systems .",
    "@xcite the interest to the many - electron state in bounded 1d systems is presently increased due to the recent progress in magnetotunnelling spectroscopy studies of such structures .",
    "@xcite as a consequence of _ e - e _ interaction , electrons form the strongly correlated state , which is referred to as luttinger liquid . main distinctive features of a luttinger liquid are the absence of fermionic quasiparticles , which manifests itself in the absence of the fermi step in the momentum distribution function , the power - law behavior of spectral functions near the fermi energy with interaction - dependent exponents ,  @xcite and wigner - like correlations of electrons .",
    "@xcite    these properties were established for ideal , _ i.e. _ boundless 1d systems . however , whether they hold for realistic mesoscopic systems of finite length is not obvious .",
    "indeed , the presence of boundaries may strongly affect the electron state and excitations since 1d electron correlation functions are known to decay as a power of distance , hence there is no characteristic length .",
    "many observations performed on mesoscopic structures containing a finite 1d system do not confirm the theoretical predictions made for ideal systems .",
    "just recall the interaction - driven conductance renormalization  @xcite in an infinite 1d system that does not actually occur because of the contacts ,  @xcite the spin polarization  @xcite that should not exist according to the mattis - lieb theorem , the ` 0.7 ' anomaly ,  @xcite many facts of the nonuniversality of conductance quantization ,  @xcite which existing theories fail to explain , and so on .",
    "it is commonly believed that electrons in a bounded 1d system form the luttinger liquid .",
    "the boundary effect consists in the change of electron correlations near the ends which are described by additional boundary exponents .",
    "this conclusion was made in several theoretical works using the bosonization approach .",
    "@xcite unfortunately , this approach is based on a number of model assumptions , which are not well justified .",
    "these are ( i ) the extension of the linear electron spectrum to infinite negative energy , which results in a violation of the conservation laws,@xcite ( ii ) the linearization of the electron spectrum , which can lead to a striking departure from the properties of a real system with quadratic dispersion relation,@xcite and ( iii ) neglecting some parts of the @xmath2 components of the electron densities in the _ e - e _ interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the goal of our paper is to investigate the electron state in 1d quantum dots beyond model assumptions . for this purpose",
    "the exact diagonalization method is employed to calculate numerically the electron density distribution in a finite 1d wire and the distribution function of electrons over single - particle states .",
    "we have found that there are two unexpected features .",
    "first , the distribution function has a @xmath0-like singularity at the fermi energy at the background of a smooth dependence on the energy .",
    "the second feature relates to the fourier spectrum of the spatial distribution of the electron density .",
    "the fourier spectrum has a step - like form at the wavevector @xmath2 . above this threshold ,",
    "the harmonics are absent or vanishing .",
    "these properties are universal in the sense that they do not depend on the _ e - e _ interaction strength , interaction radius , wire length , mean electron density .",
    "we argue that these features are caused by the wigner ordering of electrons .",
    "we compare the obtained results with the calculations carried out within the frame of the common luttinger liquid approach to find that it fails to capture the above results .",
    "the luttinger liquid theory also gives a singularity of the distribution function at the fermi energy , but its form is incorrect .",
    "the fourier spectrum of the electron density distribution turns out to have an incorrect singularity at @xmath2 and not to vanish above this value .",
    "we have clarified that this discrepancy appears because the luttinger liquid theory does not describe correctly the deformation of the wigner crystal by the boundaries .",
    "the reason of this shortcoming lies in the violation of the particle number conservation within the bosonization approach used .",
    "we find a way to remedy the luttinger liquid theory by introducing an improved expression for the electron density operator .",
    "the proposed approach allows one to describe correctly the above features of the distribution function and the fourier harmonics of electron density .",

    "<S> the spatial fourier spectrum of the electron density distribution in a finite 1d system and the distribution function of electrons over single - particle states are studied in detail to show that there are two universal features in their behavior , which characterize the electron ordering and the deformation of wigner crystal by boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution function has a @xmath0-like singularity at the fermi momentum @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier spectrum of the density has a step - like form at the wavevector @xmath2 , with the harmonics being absent or vanishing above this threshold . </S>",
    "<S> these features are found by calculations using exact diagonalization method . </S>",
    "<S> they are shown to be caused by wigner ordering of electrons , affected by the boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> however the common luttinger liquid model with open boundaries fails to capture these features , because it overestimates the deformation of the wigner crystal . </S>",
    "<S> an improvement of the luttinger liquid model is proposed which allows one to describe the above features correctly . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the corrected form of the density operator conserving the particle number . </S>"
