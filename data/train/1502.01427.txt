    "we equip @xmath1 with the riemannian metric obtained from its double cover by the unit sphere @xmath18 .",
    "the simultaneous zeroes of ensemble @xmath19 are invariant under the isometries by elements of @xmath0 ; see section [ invariance ] .",
    "because of this symmetry , authors have described this ensemble as the  most natural \" ensemble of a random polynomials defined on @xmath1 . for this reason",
    ", it has been extensively studied by kostlan - edelman@xcite , shub - smale@xcite , and others .",
    "the @xmath7-invariant ensemble of gaussian random analytic functions is defined by the following : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are iid on the standard normal distribution , @xmath12 .",
    "we will show in section [ invariance ] that the zeroes of this ensemble are invariant under all isometries of @xmath8 .",
    "we will see shortly that this ensemble is intimately tied to the @xmath0-invariance ensemble in the scaling limit as the degree @xmath22 .",

    "we give @xmath6 the metric induced by the double cover of @xmath46 by the unit sphere  @xmath47 .",
    "more specifically , we obtain a riemannian metric on @xmath48 using the inclusion of tangent spaces @xmath49 . when restricted to a sufficiently small neighborhood of the origin , the orthogonal projection @xmath50 provides a system of local coordinates on @xmath48 .",
    "we will use these systems of local coordinates to study the correlation between zeros of the restriction of the @xmath3 invariant ensemble to @xmath48 .",

    "then , for any @xmath55 and any @xmath56 we have @xmath57 the constant in the estimate is uniform on compact subsets of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "our techniques are largely based on those of bleher and di @xcite , who use the kac - rice formula ( see section [ kac - rice ] below ) to study the @xmath4-point correlation functions for the @xmath60 and @xmath61-invariant polynomials in one variable . moreover , our results in the higher dimensional real case yield the exact same short - distance asymptotic behavior ( with a different constant ) as those of bleher , shiffman , and zelditch @xcite in the complex case .",

    "theorem [ thm : universality ] above provides a real analog of the universality results that were obtained in the complex setting by bleher , shiffman , and zelditch @xcite .",
    "thus , the plots shown in figure [ graphs ] depict the universal scaling limits of the correlation functions for any submanifold @xmath6 of dimension @xmath68 or @xmath69 .",
    "the scaling limit used in theorem [ thm : universality ] is needed to get a universal correlation function .",
    "this is illustrated in section  [ sec : geometry_finite_d ] where we show that when restricted to a parabola @xmath70 the leading term from the correlation between zeros for the @xmath71-invariant polynomials of degree @xmath69 near @xmath72 depends non - trivially on @xmath73 .",
    "more generally , it can be interesting to ask how the geometry of @xmath48 affects the correlation function @xmath74 for finite degree @xmath54 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : universality ] easily adapts to to complex setting : the @xmath75-invariant ensemble of polynomials are obtained by interpreting the variables in ( [ grp ] ) as complex and replacing the real gaussians @xmath76 with complex gaussians .",
    "the @xmath77-invariant ensemble of gaussian analytic functions on @xmath78 is obtained by making the same adaptations to ( [ gaf ] ) .",

    "then , for any @xmath55 and any @xmath56 we have @xmath80 the constant in the estimate is uniform on compact subsets of @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "this serves as a weaker version of the results from @xcite in that @xmath48 is required to be embedded in projective space ( instead of being an arbitrary khler manifold ) , the line bundle is the hyperplane bundle ( corresponding to the -invariant ensemble ) , and only two - point correlation functions are considered .",

    "each of the lemmas used asserts that the constants depend uniformly on compact subsets of @xmath522 .",
    "since we reduced the statement of theorem [ thm : universality ] to theorem [ local_universality ] in subsection [ subsec_reduction ] , we have also finished the proof of theorem  [ thm : universality ] .",
    "we present a simple example illustrating that the constant from the leading term in the correlation function can depend on the geometry of a submanifolds @xmath6 if the degree @xmath54 of the ensemble is finite . thus , it is not possible to prove a universal formula for the short - range asymptotics at finite degree .",

    "more specifically , the determinant of the @xmath554 block analogous to ( [ weird_det ] ) equals : @xmath555 which is positive for @xmath429 .",
    "the proof of lemma [ lem_conv_cov_matrices ] applies after verifying that , when expressed in local coordinates , the covariance matrix for the rescaled @xmath556-invariant polynomials differs from that of the @xmath77-invariant ensemble by @xmath557 .",
