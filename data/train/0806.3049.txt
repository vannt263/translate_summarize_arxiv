    "the magellanic clouds are fundamental galaxies for astrophysics owing e.g. to their proximity , chemical compositions , age distributions , star cluster structural properties and related dynamical evolution , and as two close - by interacting galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reviews recent estimates of the distance to the clouds and arrives at the values @xmath1kpc and @xmath2kpc .",
    "more than 50 years have elapsed since the first attempts to systematically catalogue extended objects in the magellanic clouds ( e.g. the nonstellar emission nebulae of @xcite ) .",
    "we refer as extended objects the emission nebulae , star clusters , associations , and hi shells and supershells .",
    "early catalogues of star clusters included brighter ones in the smc ( @xcite , @xcite ) and lmc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "fainter clusters with deeper photographic material were detected , e.g. by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "binary or multiple clusters are another characteristics of many magellanic cloud clusters , showing their importance for cluster dynamical evolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . examples of catalogues of associations are @xcite for the lmc , @xcite for the smc , and @xcite in the bridge .",
    "a complementary study to @xcite is the catalogue of nebular complexes by @xcite based on h@xmath3 plates .",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) instrumention revealed serendipitously two faint clusters in the lmc bar that were undetected in sky survey plates ( @xcite ) .",
    "these two clusters suggested the existence of an important undetected faint population of clusters .",
    "ccd mosaics , e.g. @xcite in the smc central parts , started to unveil that elusive cluster population .",

    "each cloud harbours about half of the 29 old star clusters present in the catalogue ( electronic table  3 ; fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "such clusters are much older than the time elapsed since the last encounter between both clouds ( e.g. @xcite ) , and they can be used to probe whether the present - day spatial distribution of the old clusters retains information on the early - cloud structure .",
    "two of these are the very distant gcs ngc1841 and reticulum , at @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , which are likely lmc members ( @xcite ) .",
    "we consider for this analysis a composite rdp , in which we compute for each old star cluster the distance to the nearest mc centroid . the combined lmc and smc rdp",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . at first sight",
    ", it appears to represent a more extended structure than those discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , but the extension may be caused by the two distant gcs . in any case , the exponential disk , with a scale - length of about @xmath7 , now appears to describe the full radial range of the rdp somewhat better than the 3-parameter king profile , while the @xmath8 law fails altogether .",
    "the more extended character of this rdp is reflected on the fit structural parameters , which are larger than those derived with the younger objects ( table  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "the primary goal of this paper is to update the catalogue of extended objects in the magellanic system . with the recent addition of hst , ccd mosaics , and survey data , the number of known objects in the clouds now reaches 9503 , which represents a relatively substantial increase of @xmath0 with respect to the previous versions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it now includes hi shells and supershells , cross - identifications with the previous literature , and subsequently discovered objects .",
    "such a number of objects is large enough to allow for a statistically significant analysis of environmental effects on the distribution of structural parameters among the different classes of objects , in the lmc , smc , and bridge tidal fields separately .",
    "star clusters present similar distributions of structural parameters in the three mc subsystems .",
    "smc associations ( and related objects , emission nebulae , and hi shells and supershells ) , on the other hand , tend to be larger and more circular than in the lmc .",
    "we also detect evidence that the apparent diameter of clusters and associations increase with the distance to each cloud centroid .",
    "the ellipticity presents the opposite trend , especially in the smc .",
    "these relations are consistent with the relative strengths of the lmc , smc , and bridge tidal fields .",
    "indeed , the standard model of @xcite assumes the masses @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the lmc and smc , respectively .",
    "obviously , the bridge is less massive than the smc .",
    "such masses can produce significant tidal stress on star clusters and associations , depending on their location .",
    "with respect to the angular distribution of objects , number - density profiles extracted along the lmc bar and in a perpendicular direction can be reasonably well represented by two exponential disks , one for the bar region and the other for the outer parts of the profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "disk scale - lengths parallel to the bar are @xmath11kpc and @xmath12kpc , for the bar region and beyond , respectively . in the perpendicular direction",
    "they are @xmath13kpc and @xmath14kpc , for the high - surface brightness disk and outer ring , respectively .",
    "similar profiles extracted along equivalent directions in the smc follow a single exponential disk with @xmath15kpc of scale - length .",
    "alternatively , when ( angular - averaged ) radial number - density profiles are considered , the large - scale structure of both clouds appears to be best described by a 3-parameter king - like function , characterised by core and halo sub - structures . in this case , the lmc core and tidal radii are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively ; smc values are a factor @xmath12 of the lmc ones . in absolute scale ,",
    "lmc values are @xmath18kpc and @xmath19kpc , while smc ones are about half of these .",
    "the tidal / core radii ratio in both clouds imply low concentration parameters , comparable to those of sparse galactic gcs .",
    "what emerges from the present work is a scenario where the present - day , ( angular - averaged ) large - scale structures of both clouds appear to behave as tidally - truncated systems ( which is not unexpected , since they are milky way satellites ) , characterised by well - defined core and halo sub - structures .",
    "this picture comes about despite the fact that both clouds are not spherical systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "thus , they have undergone severe tidal perturbation when the last dynamical and hydrodynamical interaction between the clouds took place , about 200myr ago ( @xcite ) . taken isolately , the older lmc and smc star clusters , on the other hand , appear to be distributed as an exponential disk .",
    "this distribution is possibly reminiscent of the clouds structure prior to the last interaction .",
    "the lmc / smc interaction is not unusual in the local universe",
    ". they can be classified into the minor - merger interaction picture , which involves high and low - mass galaxies ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "a series of examples of such interactions involving galaxies with prominent bulge and disk has been studied in that paper .",
    "some of the disk galaxies developed the double - disk structure , similarly to the present case of the lmc .",
