    "the motivation to study the metal - insulator transition in the s - d exchange , or vonsovsky - zener , model @xcite ( now it is frequently called kondo lattice model ) is given by previous successes obtained studying the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in the hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the s - d exchange model is complementary to the hubbard model . while in the hubbard model the interacting electrons responsible for magnetism and for electron conductivity",
    "are located in the same band , in the s - d exchange model they are located in different bands . in one band",
    "the electrons are delocalized or itinerant , therefore these electrons are called conduction electrons .",
    "the other band contains electrons that are localized on lattice sites .",
    "the type of the interaction is also different between the two models .",
    "the hubbard model contains an on - site coulomb interaction modeled by a single energy parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the s - d exchange model contains a spin - spin interaction between the localized and conduction electrons with a coupling constant ( s - d exchange parameter ) @xmath1 .",
    "the s - d exchange model is used in the description of rare earths , in which 4f - electrons have a very localized nature @xcite .",
    "the description of colossal magnetoresistance materials such as ( la , ca , sr)mno compounds sometimes is based on the s - d exchange model assuming that the @xmath2 electrons are rather localized and the @xmath3 electrons are itinerant @xcite .",
    "whereas for relatively weakly correlated systems the crystal with half - filled energy bands is a metal , for strong enough correlation the system should be an insulator , with each electron sitting in a localized state associated with a given site .",
    "this corresponds to the splitting of the energy bands into hubbard subbands separated ( for a large enough interaction parameter @xmath0 ) by a gap @xcite . in the s - d exchange model",
    "the parameter @xmath0 is replaced by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spin of localized electrons .",
    "the hubbard - iii approximation @xcite provides a qualitative description of the metal - insulator transition for both models .",
    "this description however does not take into account all quantum effects ; for the case of s - d exchange model , it turns out to correspond to the classical spin limit @xmath6 @xcite . the dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )",
    "@xcite was a real breakthrough in this respect dramatically improving the description of metallic phase near the transition .",
    "whereas within the hubbard - iii approximation the main effect of approaching the mit is the growth of damping of electron states at the fermi energy , together with appearance of shoulders as the precursors of future hubbard bands ( two - peak structure ) , the dmft gives the _ three_-peak structure , with the `` kondo peak '' near the fermi energy , that is , the growth of effective mass instead of the growth of the damping .",
    "the origin of this peak is the formation of a resonance due to electron scattering by _ quantum _ spins @xcite .",
    "the dynamical mean - field theory is formally exact in the limit of infinite space dimensionality whereas the hubbard - iii approximation is formally exact ( within the s - d exchange model ) in the limit of infinite space dimensionality _ and _ infinite , that is , classical , spin @xcite .",
    "in particular , in this limit there is no difference between the case of ferromagnetic ( @xmath7 ) and antiferromagnetic ( @xmath8 ) s - d exchange coupling ; the kondo resonance exists only in the latter case ( the detailed discussion of the kondo effect and related physics can be found in ref . ) .",
    "the dmft is the best local approximation , that is , it corresponds to an optimal self - consistent choice of the momentum - independent electron self - energy . for real two- and three - dimensional systems",
    "it is just an approximation , which is not quite controllable .",
    "the dual fermion formalism @xcite allows to construct a diagrammatic expansion for the non - local correlation effects starting from the dmft green s function as a zeroth - order approximation .",
    "the differences between the dual fermion results and the dmft results were investigated recently @xcite for the hubbard model on triangular lattice , and turned out to be very essential .",
    "the present paper discusses the differences between dual fermions and dmft for the metal - insulator transition in the s - d exchange model .",
    "the mit in the s - d exchange model in the classical limit @xmath6 has been studied in ref .. in this work we consider a _",
    "s - d exchange model at a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice , for @xmath9 where we expect quantum effects to be maximal .",
    "we study the role of non - local correlation effects by comparison of the results of dmft and dual fermion calculations .",
    "we show that the dmft strongly overestimates the critical value of the coupling constant for the metal - insulator transition @xmath10 .",
    "we also show that in the s - d exchange model quantum effects are indeed relevant , since the results for positive and negative values of the coupling constant @xmath1 are essentially different .",
    "the s - d exchange model contains electrons that are localized on lattice sites , and conduction electrons that can hop between different sites @xmath11 .",
    "let us introduce their annihilation operators @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the spin projection .",
    "the annihilation operators for the localized electrons will be designated @xmath14 .",
    "the hamiltonian contains ( in order of appearance in eq . ) a hopping term , a hubbard term that is included for calculational purposes , the s - d exchange interaction , and the chemical potential @xmath15 term :    @xmath16    @xmath17 is the number of conduction electrons and @xmath18 .",
    "the spin - spin interaction term reads : @xmath19    the hubbard interaction is included to ( computationally ) ensure the half - filling of the lattice sites ( one localized electron per site ) . strictly speaking",
    ", it is reached only in the limit @xmath20 .",
    "we will do the calculations for a large but finite @xmath0 . with this hubbard - term and @xmath21 and @xmath22 half - filling",
    "is achieved to sufficient extent .",
    "our goal was to study the density of conduction - electron states ( dos ) of the s - d exchange model at different coupling constants @xmath1 .",
    "the calculations were carried out at the matsubara axis ( imaginary frequencies ) and , to obtain the densities of states we performed an analytical continuation of the green s functions on the real axis , using the maximum entropy method @xcite .",
    "the green s functions we obtained self - consistently in dmft versus the dual fermion approach . in short ,",
    "both dmft and dual fermion utilize an effective - medium concept , so that they deal with the impurity model described by the action @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the action of an isolated lattice site , and @xmath25 is a hybridization by the effective bath .",
    "frequency - dependence of the hybridization allows to handle the effects of local fluctuations , that underlie the kondo physics . on the other hand",
    ", this @xmath26-dependence makes the impurity problem non - hamiltonian and therefore requires a usage of numerical solvers to obtain its green function @xmath27 and two - particle vertex @xmath28 ( the later is required for dual fermions ) . as a numerical solver",
    ", we used the interaction - expansion continuous - time quantum monte carlo procedure @xcite .",
    "the dual fermion lattice green s function equals ( spin and orbital indices are omitted ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a dispersion law arising from the hopping @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the self - energy function of the dual ensemble obtained in certain diagrammatic approximation .",
    "vertices of dual diagrams are vertex parts of the impurity problem .",
    "dmft can be represented as the zeroth - order dual fermion scheme with @xmath33 . in this approximation ,",
    "the lines ( propagators ) in dual diagrams have a simple meaning , as they are equal to the non - local part of the green s function , @xmath34 ( for a general case , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are also exactly related , although the relationship is more complicated ) .",
    "one can easily see that dmft describes purely local contribution to the lattice self - energy ( and is actually shown to correspond to the summation of all local diagrams ) , whereas dual fermion diagrams describe non - local effects .",
    "more technical detail can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the hybridization function @xmath37 was obtained self - consistently from the condition that the local part of the dual propagator vanishes , @xmath38 .",
    "this eliminates the first - order hartree dual diagram , and thus the leading correction to @xmath32 is given by the second - order ( see diagram ( b ) and formula ( 20 ) of ref.@xcite ) , @xmath39 ( summation over spins is also implied ) .",
    "the last expression is an approximation used for the dual fermion calculations in the present paper .",
    "the calculations were performed for the paramagnetic state of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) on a square lattice with the nearest - neighbor hopping parameter @xmath40 ( which means a half - bandwidth equal to 1 ) , we have chosen @xmath41 and the inverse temperature @xmath42 .",
    "dual fermion diagrams were calculated at a @xmath43 slab in momentum space .",
    "the final accurate calculations took about two weeks of cpu load per @xmath1-value in the dmft case and about 10% more in the dual fermion case .",
    "the amount of self - consistency loops was roughly 10 - 20 while the number of monte carlo steps was roughly doubled with each loop in the last 6 loops until it reached @xmath44 .",
    "the mit for the s - d exchange model is visible in fig .",
    "[ jcrit ] . we have quoted values of the coupling constant just around the transition .",
    "although the temperature is quite high and the hubbard-@xmath41 we still see a qualitatively correct picture of the densities of states , accurate enough to estimate a reasonable value of the coupling constant @xmath1 for the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we consider the state to be conducting if there is a local maximum at the fermi level and insulating if there is a local minimum at the fermi level , because the temperature is so high .",
    "the choice of @xmath41 in the quantum monte carlo calculations is justified because in our calculations @xmath45 and @xmath46 so that half - filling is achieved to sufficient extent .    [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table [ jcrit_table ] we compare several different calculational methods that were used to obtain a critical value of the coupling constant for the metal - insulator transition .",
    "the difference in behavior of the dos between positive and negative values of the coupling constant is displayed in figures [ jsmall ] and [ jlarge ]        in figure [ jsmall ] we display the results for @xmath47 calculated within both dmft and dual fermions .",
    "the different colors represent positive and negative @xmath1-values .",
    "stars correspond as before to the dmft - calculation while the dual fermion result is drawn with lines . in this picture",
    "we look at the general shape of the curves .",
    "we see that they are not the same for positive and negative @xmath1 and that incorporating non - local corrections through dual fermions changes the results : the difference is more pronounced in the dual fermion case .",
    "in figure [ jlarge ] we display the results for @xmath48 , also calculated using dmft ( stars ) and dual fermions ( lines ) .",
    "the different colors again represent the positive and negative @xmath1-values .",
    "the general shape of the curves is much more different between positive and negative @xmath1 for @xmath48 than for @xmath47 .",
    "in this work we justify two claims .",
    "first , the dual fermion formalism description of the metal - insulator transition in the s - d exchange model to date predicts a critical value of the coupling constant @xmath49 .",
    "this value differs from the dmft - result by a factor of more than 2 and corresponds nicely to the result obtained in the other work using a non - local correlations approach @xcite .",
    "the different results between various calculational schemes are summarized in table [ jcrit_table ] .",
    "second , there is a clear qualitative difference between densities of states of the s - d exchange model for antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic s - d exchange coupling .",
    "this shows that incorporating quantum effects such as the kondo effect is essential for a good description of the model ."
