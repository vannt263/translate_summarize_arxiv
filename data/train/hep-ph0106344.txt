    "the top antiquark spin axis can be defined with the same angle @xmath63 , but in the @xmath66 rest - frame with respect to @xmath67 direction .",

    "( [ eett ] ) .",
    "there are three typical bases charaterized by choosing a different angle @xmath63 as follows .",
    "* helicity basis : for @xmath79 , the top - quark spin axis is against ( along ) its direction of motion .",
    "* beamline basis : for @xmath80 , the top - quark spin is in the positron direction in the top rest - frame .",
    "* off - diagonal basis : @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 represent the sm parts of @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively in eq .",
    "( [ abd ] ) .",
    "although one can similarly define another off - diagonal basis for @xmath76 scattering , the considerably small difference between the two bases allows us to use the off - diagonal basis for @xmath86 even when discussing @xmath76 scattering  @xcite .    regarding the off - diagonal basis , parke and",
    "collaborators have applied it to top - pair production at a linear and hadron colliders @xcite , and found many advantages in studying physics of the top quark .",
    "it gives rise to substantial spin correlation than the helicity or beamline basis do  @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are equal to zero for off - diagonal basis at the sm tree level and therefore all @xmath89 pairs are of opposite spins .",
    "moreover , the dominant component up to 97% of the @xmath90 cross section is @xmath91 at the energy @xmath92 , much larger than 58% in the helicity basis  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the top - pair production density matrix in the off - diagonal basis is greatly simplified due to many zero entries in the matrix @xcite .    in the presence of anomalous couplings",
    ", however , the situation may be different due to the very different helicity structures of the new operators .",
    "thus we will consider all of the three bases in the following discussions in order to find out which basis is more sensitive to which class of operators .",
    "of the eleven operators listed in eq .",
    "( [ operators ] ) we will take two operators @xmath43 and @xmath93 for a detail study .",
    "we choose these two operators for the following reasons .",
    "first , they have distinctive energy - dependence as seen in table  [ one ] , which characterizes a typical feature of anomalous couplings .",
    "second , while the operator @xmath94 modifies @xmath95 and @xmath96 which affect the top - quark production , the operator @xmath93 modifies the top - quark decay as well .",
    "in addition , these two operators have no direct effects on @xmath97 measurement , so their coefficients are not strongly constrained .",
    "consequently , the top - quark production and decay would be the unique place to explore them if they generate sizeable effects at high energy experiments . numerically taking the conservative limits in eq .",
    "( [ bound3 ] ) , we will adopt @xmath98 in our analysis .",
    "[ c - s ]    6.2 truein    we plot in fig .  2 the total cross section and various polarized cross sections of @xmath99 versus @xmath100 in the presence of operators @xmath43 and @xmath93 .",
    "one can clearly see from the figure the effects of new physics .",
    "however , the operator @xmath93 seems not to make any correction to @xmath101 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the couplings of the right - handed electron with @xmath102 and @xmath103 are from @xmath104 gauge interaction , while @xmath93 are of purely @xmath105 interactions .",
    "we have numerically verified the cancellation of @xmath93 between @xmath106 and @xmath107 contributions .    in fig .  3 and fig .  4",
    ", we plot the energy dependence of the fraction of top quark pair production in three different bases for @xmath43 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the fraction is defined by @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the polarized total cross section for the process @xmath110 including appropriate anomalous couplings . while the off - diagonal , beamline , and helicity bases present the most , medium , and least polarization of @xmath11 states , respectively , the percentage effects due to new operators are of reversed order , namely it is the most significant in the helicity basis instead .",
    "the reason is as follows : the new physics effects come dominantly from the interference terms between the sm and anomalous couplings at the order of @xmath111 , and the pure contributions of the anomalous couplings set in at a higher order of @xmath112 .",
    "since in the sm with the off - diagonal basis , the spin configuration is almost exclusively @xmath113 , the leading anomalous contribution coming from the interference is forced to be in the same unique configuration . on the other hand , the helicity basis presents a large partition between @xmath113 and @xmath114 , so that it allows a more significant effect in reshuffling these two configurations due to the existence of the anomalous operators , thus leading to possibly appreciable differences when comparing with the sm predictions .",
    "we notice that because of the strong energy dependence of the couplings , the effects are generally larger at higher energies .",
    "moreover , we also observed a particularly large deviation from the sm prediction for the operator @xmath43 in @xmath115 reaction near @xmath116 gev , see fig .",
    "this is due to the corrections from the direct term which is proportion to @xmath117 . in the case",
    "the interference term gives the negative contributions and the direct term gives the positive contributions , there should be a peak at some energy scale and this scale is decided by the size of @xmath118 and @xmath17 . for the parameter we selected i.e. @xmath119 , it appears at the energy of 850 gev .    in fig .  5 and fig .",
    "6 , we show the behavior of the fraction at @xmath120 as a function of the couplings @xmath43 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "the sm prediction can be read off from the figures for the couplings to be zero .",
    "the sign of the coupling @xmath43 may be inferred by different beam polarizaton choices .",
    "for instance , consider a @xmath68 final state as in fig .",
    "5 , a positive coupling gives significant enhancement to @xmath121 initial state and a negative coupling leads a reduction for @xmath115 initial state .    given the discussion above , we conclude that the percentage corrections from anomalous couplings to the spin configuration in the off - diagonal basis are much smaller than that in the helicity basis for the polarized @xmath122 scattering .",
    "the enhanced spin correlation in the sm is not necessarily beneficial in distinguishing contributions from anomalous couplings .",
    "we now consider the process of top decay and examine the effects of anomalous couplings @xmath0 on the correlation coefficient .",
    "in general the effective vertex of @xmath0 coupling can be written as [ coup ] _",
    "twb^=i [ g_l^p_l + g_r^p_r + g_tb^l p_l + g_tb^r p_r ] , where @xmath51 and @xmath123 are the momenta of incoming top quark and outgoing bottom quark respectively and g_l&=&gv_tb-(2k^2 ) + + , + g_r&= & + , + g_tb^l&=&- - , + g_tb^r&=&- - .",
    "note that the sm coupling is the first term in @xmath124 .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ coup ] ) that the leading corrections to the top decay at order @xmath111 come from interference between the sm and terms in @xmath124 and terms in @xmath125 .",
    "we will henceforth neglect effects from @xmath126 and @xmath127 which are suppressed by @xmath112 .    using the narrow width approximation for the @xmath128 boson ( k^2-m^2 ) , we express the polarized differential top - decay width for @xmath129 as [ width ] = ( 1-|y)^2(1 + 2|y)(1 + ) ( 1_d ) +",
    "+ o ( ) , where @xmath130 and @xmath131 is the angle between the momentum direction of the lepton or down - type light quark and the top - spin axis in the top - quark rest - frame . here",
    ", we neglect all fermion mass except top quark . the polarized differential decay rate in the sm is conveniently parameterized as [ rate ] = where @xmath132 , @xmath133 ( lepton or down - type light quark ) or @xmath134 ( neutrino or up - type light quark ) .",
    "the correlation coefficients @xmath135 are @xmath136 and @xmath137 for @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath138 , respectively  @xcite . comparing eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) , we find that the anomalous couplings do not give corrections to the correlation coefficient @xmath139 up to @xmath140 . since all spin bases are defined in the process of top production , the angular distributions of different decay products give same relationship of different spin bases .",
    "therefore we select the angle distribution between the momentum direction of the lepton or down - type light quark and the top - spin axis at top rest frame , whose correlation coefficient @xmath139 is lagest",
    ". we will show in the next subsection that this selection is advantageous for us to define observables with large value .",
    "we have also recalculated the top - decay width in the presence of the anomalous coupling , which is shown in table  [ two ] .",
    "we find the corrections may be as large as @xmath141 .",
