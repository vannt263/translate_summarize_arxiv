    "the game of septoku is a sudoku variant played on a grid of hexagons .",
    "the puzzle was invented in 2006 by bruce oberg @xcite .",
    "septoku is played on a hexagonal board of side 4 with 37 cells , as shown in a sample puzzle in figure  [ fig1]a @xcite .",
    "we label the cells on the board by numbering them sequentially ( figure  [ fig1]b )",
    ".    we will refer to a * row * of the board to include not only the horizontal rows , but also the ",
    "diagonal rows \" parallel to the other sides of the board .",
    "for example the cells numbered @xmath0,@xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3 form one row , as do the cells @xmath0,@xmath4,@xmath5,@xmath6 and @xmath7,@xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10,@xmath11 .",
    "we will abbreviate these three rows as  row 1@xmath124 \" ,  row 1@xmath1216 \" and  row 3@xmath1228 \" .",
    "the puzzle is to fill the 37 cells with seven symbols ( the numbers 1 to 7 ) such that    each row contains different symbols .",
    "there are seven rows in each of three directions , so 21 rows in all .",
    "note that most rows contain _ less _ than 7 cells .",
    "the seven * * circular regions * * ( with grey centers ) must each contain all seven symbols .",
    "for example the cells @xmath13 must contain all of the numbers 1 to 7 .",
    "we will refer to a circular region by its center , i.e.  circle 6 \" refers to the cells @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 . as a visual aid in all large diagrams , each circular region",
    "is marked by a grey circle .",
    "in general , any subset of the board that must contain distinct symbols will be called a * region*.    a puzzle is created using a blank board with a number of seeds filled in ( figure  [ fig1]a ) .",
    "the puzzle is to fill out the rest of the board so the above rules are satisfied , such a completed board will be called a * valid * board .",
    "a well - crafted puzzle has only one solution .",
    "bruce oberg has created several pages of enjoyable septoku puzzles of varying difficulty starting from 7 to 13 seeds @xcite .    in sudoku , each cell ( usually called a square in this case ) is in exactly three regions , a ( normal ) row , column , and @xmath18 block .",
    "there are nine rows , nine columns , and nine @xmath18 blocks , so the total number of regions is 27 . in septoku , the total number of regions is 28 ( seven rows in each of three directions , plus seven circles ) , even though the board is less than half the size of a sudoku board .",
    "each cell is in at least four regions and sometimes even five .",
    "not all regions contain all seven symbols , but we shall see that a septoku solution is more constrained and there are fewer solutions .",
    "a valid septoku board must also satisfy certain additional constraints that are not at all obvious .",
    "in fact , we will see that the above rules above are so stringent that there are only six valid boards , up to reflections and rotations of the board , and permutations of the seven symbols .",
    "* theorem 1 * : in a valid septoku board , each circle center @xmath19 must have a unique symbol .",
    ": suppose otherwise",
    ". then there must be some symbol that occurs twice among the circle centers .",
    "the center symbol is clearly unique by the rules of the puzzle , so without loss of generality , assume a 1 appears in cells 6 and 21",
    ". there must be a 1 in the center circle 19 , and this can only be in cell 13 or 25 .",
    "but if it is in 25 , then circle 8 can contain no 1 at all .",
    "thus there must be a 1 in cell 13 .",
    "there must be a 1 in circle 17 , and this can now only be in cell 24 , and a 1 in circle 32 , which can only be in cell 31 .",
    "but now this is not a valid septoku board , because circle 30 contains two 1 s .",
    "* theorem 2 * : in a valid septoku board , each corner @xmath20 plus the center @xmath21 must have a unique symbol .",
    ": suppose otherwise .",
    "then there must be some symbol that occurs twice among the corners ( the center symbol is clearly unique by the rules of the puzzle ) . without loss of generality , assume a 1 appears in cells 1 and 22 . by theorem  1",
    "there must be a 1 in some circle center , and this can only be in cell 8 or 30 . in either case , there can no longer be a 1 in the center circle 19 , so this is not a valid septoku board .",
    "* theorem 3 * : in a valid septoku board , each symbol must appear at least five times .",
    ": suppose the symbol 1 appears four or fewer times . by theorems 1 and 2",
    "each symbol must appear in a circle center , and in a corner ( or once in the center , 19 ) .",
    "if 1 occurs in a corner and one circle center , then this covers only two of the circles out of seven .",
    "there is no way the last two 1 s can cover the remaining five circles , since one cell is in common with at most two circles .",
    "it remains a possibility that the 1 is in the center , cell 19 .",
    "however it is not possible for the three other 1 s to cover the six remaining circles without two being in the same row .    if each symbol occurs 5 times this covers only 35 of the 37 board locations , so at least one symbol must occur more than 5 times .",
    "in fact there are only two possibilities :    six of the symbols appear 5 times , one symbol appears 7 times .",
    "five of the symbols appear 5 times , two symbols appear 6 times .",
    "we shall now see that both of these possibilities can occur .",
    "* theorem 4 * : not counting reflections , rotations , and symbol permutations , there are only * six * valid septoku boards . : by applying a symbol permutation , any valid board has a version where the center looks like figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the reason why this configuration was chosen is that the symbol permutation @xmath22 rotates the pattern in the center circle counter - clockwise by 60 degrees , and the permutation @xmath23 does a clockwise rotation describes the permutation which sends @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 . ] .    from theorem  1 we know that the symbol 1 must appear in some circle center .",
    "it suffices to consider only the cases where this 1 is in cell 8 or 21 . for",
    "if the 1 is at cell 17 or 30 we reflect the board across row 1@xmath1237 , and then apply the permutation @xmath31 to bring it into standard form with a 1 at cell 8 or 21 . from theorem  2",
    "we know that the symbol 1 must appear in some corner , and thus all possible septoku boards have a standard form that looks like one of the four in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "therefore , if we find all solutions to the four puzzles above , we will find all possible septoku boards .",
    "this may seem difficult , but actually there are not many solutions .",
    "* proposition 1 * : puzzle 4 is unsolvable . :",
    "circle 17 must contain a 1 , but there is no cell where a 1 can be placed without producing two 1 s in some row .",
    "* proposition 2 * : puzzles 1 - 3 each have 4 solutions . :",
    "it is probably possible to prove this analytically , but we use an integer programming model to make sure we have found all solutions .    we define an unknown binary @xmath32 matrix @xmath33 as : @xmath34    .constraints for the integer programming ( ip ) model . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath33 must satisfy the constraints in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "there are several programming languages for solving such problems , we use gams ( general algebraic modeling system ) .",
    "the details of the model are in the gams input file in appendix a.    a specialized solver is needed to solve integer programming problems .",
    "fortunately , a free solver is available on the web , the neos server @xcite .",
    "you can submit the gams model in appendix a using the web form .",
    "the model will be solved ( in under 1 second ) and the results will be emailed to you . the solver will return a single solution , if one exists . to get additional solutions ,",
    "we add another constraint that eliminates the solution that was just found . after doing this four times , the solver reports that no more solutions exist . for the four puzzles ,",
    "the solutions returned by the gams solves are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "since there are 12 solutions to puzzles # 1#4 , one might think there are exactly 12 septoku boards .",
    "however , by applying rotations , reflections , and permutations , we can show that some boards can be converted into others .",
    "we define :    @xmath35 as the transformation that rotates the board clockwise @xmath36 .",
    "therefore @xmath37 is a rotation counter - clockwise by @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath38 as the reflection of the board across the @xmath39-axis ( row 16@xmath1222 )",
    ".    then we have the following identities between boards : @xmath40 thus , there are only six boards ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "three of them contain five of each number except for 3 and 6 , these are boards @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 in figure  [ fig5 ] . boards @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 in figure  [ fig5 ] have five of each number , except for the central number 7 , of which there are seven",
    ". the number 7 appears in each of the 28 regions .",
    "finally , how do we know that none of the six boards in figure  [ fig5 ] can be transformed into one another by applying reflections , rotations , and permutations ( which would mean there are fewer than 6 solutions ) ?",
    "for example , how do we know that we ca nt apply some symmetry transformation @xmath47 followed by a permutation @xmath48 to convert board @xmath41 into @xmath42 ?",
    "@xmath49 we note that no symmetry transformation changes the value of the center , so for equation ( [ eq : atob ] ) to hold , @xmath48 must leave 7 s alone .",
    "therefore , @xmath47 must map 7 s on one board to 7 s on the other .",
    "it is impossible for any board in @xmath50 to be transformed into one of @xmath51 , as they contain different numbers of 7 s .",
    "as far as transforming @xmath41 to @xmath42 , there are only two rotations of @xmath41 that produce the pattern of 7 s in @xmath42",
    ". the center circle must be the same in both boards , this fixes the permutation @xmath48 , and by direct calculation we find that neither of these transformations of @xmath41 yield @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , it is time consuming but not difficult to verify that none of the six boards can be transformed into any of the others .",
    "we also verified this using a computer , applying each of the 12 symmetry transformations , and then applying each of the @xmath52 permutations in turn .",
    "a program that did this found that there was no way to transform a board of one of the six fundamental types @xmath41-@xmath46 into any of the others ( this program also identified @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) .",
    "* theorem 5 * : counting reflections , rotations , and symbol permutations as separate boards , there are 120,960 valid septoku boards . :",
    "each solution board has @xmath59 different versions using all possible permutations of symbols .",
    "these boards are all distinct , since each permutation is distinct .",
    "we can then apply the 12 symmetry transformations to generate @xmath60 board positions . however , not all of these will be distinct .",
    "if @xmath47 is a symmetry transformation and @xmath48 is a permutation , we need to figure out under what conditions a is unchanged after application of @xmath47 followed by @xmath48 , or @xmath61 notice that none of the symmetry transformations change the value of the central cell . therefore , for equation",
    "( [ eq : aunch ] ) to hold the permutation @xmath48 can not change the value of the central cell ( which is always 7 in standard form ) , so the symmetry transformation must leave all 7 s unchanged .",
    "we note that for the boards @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , the only symmetry transformation that leaves all 7 s unchanged is a rotation of the board by @xmath62 .",
    "we can then calculate that @xmath63 and similarly for @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this effectively halves the number of distinct boards generated from these three , giving us @xmath64 different solutions .",
    "the 7 s in the boards @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are unchanged by a rotation of @xmath65 , and @xmath66 and similarly for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this reduces the number of distinct boards generated in these cases by a factor of 6 , giving us @xmath67 .",
    "the total number of possible boards is therefore @xmath68 .",
    "* theorem 6 * : the smallest number of seeds for a septoku puzzle to have a unique solution is six .",
    ": clearly the answer can not be less than six .",
    "if this were possible , there must be two of the seven numbers not even among the seeds .",
    "if there is one solution , a different one can be obtained by swapping these two numbers .    to show the answer is six ,",
    "we need only find a puzzle with six seeds and a unique solution . by the same argument as the previous paragraph , the six seeds must be for six of the seven numbers ( all different values ) .",
    "we wrote a program that takes one of the six valid boards , and considers all combinations of 6 different seeds .",
    "the program then checks each such puzzle for a unique solution by matching against all possible symmetry transformations and permutations of the six possible boards . in this manner hundreds of puzzles",
    "were generated with six seeds and a unique solution .",
    "four of them are shown in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "working by hand , finding solutions to these puzzles is difficult ( although the first is not so bad as we will show below ) .",
    "the construction technique assures that the solution is unique .",
    "we have also verified uniqueness using an integer programming model .",
    "theorems  1 - 3 are useful for solving septoku puzzles by hand .",
    "there is one more theorem that is even more powerful .",
    "* theorem 7 * : in a valid septoku board , the seven symbols can be partitioned into three pairs and one unpaired symbol which is the value of the central cell 19 .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath69 be any two cells that map to each other under @xmath70 rotation of the board ( for example cells 1 and 37 , or 2 and 36 , or 7 and 31 , etc . ) .",
    "then either    @xmath39 and @xmath69 have ( different ) values taken from one of the three pairs , or    @xmath39 and @xmath69 both have the value of the central cell ( clearly this is only possible if @xmath39 and @xmath69 are not in the same row ) .",
    "_ proof _ : for a board in standard form , theorem  7 is just a restatement of equation ( [ eq:180deg ] ) ( which is true of boards @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 as well as @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) . since any solution is a symmetry transformation plus permutation of one of @xmath41@xmath46 , all solutions satisfy theorem  7 .    in the solution boards @xmath41-@xmath46 in standard form ,",
    "the pairs are always @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , while the unpaired central cell is 7 .",
    "theorem  7 says that if we find a 1 in some cell , there must be a 4 in the cell diametrically opposite , and similarly for the other pairs .",
    "if there is a 7 in some cell , there must be another 7 in the cell diametrically opposite .    in solving septoku puzzles , once we figure out what the pairings are , theorem  7 is very powerful in filling out the board .",
    "once we figure out one board location we can also fill in the cell diametrically opposite .",
    "this actually makes many puzzles easy , and the only ones that are not easy are those where it is hard to figure out the pairs .",
    "for example , we now show how theorem  7 can be used to solve the first 6-seed puzzle in figure  [ fig6 ] .",
    "first , it is clear that the center can only be the missing symbol , 4 , and the only possibility for cell 20 is a 2 .",
    "the board now looks like figure  [ fig7]a .",
    "now consider the pairs of theorem  7 .",
    "clearly @xmath74 from the center is one such pair , the other two can only be @xmath75 and @xmath76 , or @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "cells 4 and 34 must come from some pair , and they ca nt come from @xmath74 or @xmath75 because row 4@xmath1234 already contains a 1 and 2 , and cells 4 and 34 ca nt come from @xmath76 because by theorem  2 the corners must be distinct .",
    "so we now know that the three pairs are @xmath74 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 and the board looks like figure  [ fig8]a .",
    "cell 6 must be either a 1 or a 7 ( by theorem  1 ) .",
    "if it is a 7 then circle 32 can not contain a 7 , so cell 6 must be a 1 and cell 32 is a 7 .",
    "we can now determine that cells 28 and 31 must be 1 s , and cells 10 and 7 must be 7 s ( figure  [ fig8]b ) .",
    "cell 34 must be a 3 or a 5 , but if it is a 5 then circle 8 can contain no 5 . thus cell 34",
    "must be a 3 , and cell 4 must be a 5 .",
    "circle 21 must contain a 3 , and it can only be at 27 .",
    "cell 1 must be a 2 or a 6 , but if it is a 6 then circle 32 can contain no 6 .",
    "thus , cell 1 must be a 2 , and cell 37 a 6 ( figure  [ fig8]c ) .",
    "we can now readily fill in the rest of the solution ( figure  [ fig8]d ) .",
    "in fact , this solution board @xmath33 is a version of board @xmath45 , as can be seen by verifying the identity @xmath79 where @xmath80 is just the reflection of the board across the row 1@xmath1237 .",
    "we now consider how we could modify the rules to change the puzzle",
    ". we may be able to increase the number of possible solutions by modifying the rules in several ways .",
    "we could increase the number of symbols ( to eight , for example ) while keeping the requirement that the symbols must be distinct within each of the 28 regions .",
    "another possibility is to remove some of the regions . to keep the symmetry of the regions ,",
    "if we remove one region it should be the center circle 19 .",
    "the following theorem shows , however , that dropping the center circle region does not change the puzzle at all !    * theorem 8 * : consider septoku , but drop the requirement that the symbols in the center circle 19 be distinct .",
    "there are * no solutions * to the puzzle where the cells in the center circle are not distinct . :",
    "suppose a solution exists with two symbols the same in circle 19 .",
    "because the rows must be distinct , the central number can not be the duplicate , so without loss of generality assume that the symbol 1 appears in cells 13 and 26 . but circles 17 and 21 must both contain 1 s , and these can only be on row 16@xmath1222 .",
    "there can not be two 1 s along this row , so no solution is possible .    by theorem  8",
    ", we can relax the original rules of septoku to remove the center circle , and the puzzle will be unchanged . however , it is possible to find new solutions if we remove one or more of the other circle regions .",
    "we have considered how to relax the rules of the puzzle to _ increase _ the number of solutions .",
    "now we wish to go in a different direction , namely keeping the rules the same , but making the board larger .",
    "since a larger board must still satisfy all of the original rules of septoku , this has the effect of _ reducing _ the number of solutions .",
    "some septoku solutions have the property that the solution can be extended off the board , while holding to a natural extension of the rules .",
    "we can extend two opposite edges of the board to create a 49-cell * rhombus board * in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "the rhombus ( or diamond if rotated @xmath36 counter - clockwise ) board has two sets of rows which all have 7 cells , and another set of rows which have 2 to 7 cells .",
    "there are also now 9 circular regions .",
    "only two of the six septoku solutions can be extended in this way ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) , and therefore up to symmetry transformations and permutations there are only * two * valid rhombus septoku boards , a fact verified by an ip model .",
    "the two possible valid rhombus septoku boards are shown in figure  [ fig10 ] .",
    "in addition , the rhombus pattern can be repeated periodically to infinity .",
    "another variation which is possible is the 73-cell * star septoku * board ( figure  [ fig11 ] ) . on this board , some of the rows have more than seven cells .",
    "we therefore modify the rules to specify that the symbols in _ any connected subset of a row with seven or fewer cells must contain distinct symbols_. there are only two valid star septoku boards .    not surprisingly , it is easy to create many 6-seed puzzles in rhombus or star septoku that have unique solutions .",
    "an example of one such puzzle is shown in figure  [ fig11]b .",
    "in all the board types discussed so far , the circular regions overlap . it is possible to create a board on a hexagonal grid where the circular regions do not overlap , more reminiscent of ordinary sudoku .",
    "figure  [ fig12 ] shows a * flower septoku * board , which has 49 cells and 34 regions .    since the circular regions in a flower septoku board no longer overlap , one might suspect that this would allow for more solutions",
    "however , note that there are now 15 rows of length seven which must contain all seven numbers . an ip model has found that there are only * three * different flower septoku boards , up to a symmetry transformation and permutation .",
    "these three solutions also satisfy theorem  7so despite the change in geometry , solutions to flower septoku have the same symmetry properties as solutions in regular septoku .",
    "septoku is a puzzle where the set of solutions is far more constrained than it may first appear .",
    "we have found that there are only six fundamentally different solution boards , and this knowledge has allowed us to create 6-seed puzzles that can be quite difficult to solve by hand , at least not without detailed knowledge of the puzzle .",
    "theorems 1 , 2 , 3 and 7 are useful for solving septoku puzzles .",
    "there are several possible ways to reduce the constraints in septoku , so that more solutions are possible .",
    "the first possibility is to reduce the number of regions .",
    "the most obvious to remove are some of the circle regions , we have shown that removing only the center circle does not change the puzzle .",
    "a second possibility is to consider a board where the circular regions do not overlap , one example is the 49-cell flower septoku board . a third possibility is to allow more than 7 symbols , but keep them unique among rows or inside circles . even 8 symbols will give a much larger number of different solutions .    the main difference between sudoku and septoku",
    "are the extra constraints imposed by an additional set of parallel rows in a hexagonal grid . in any variation of septoku",
    "we have considered , these additional constraints have resulted in a relatively small number of solutions .",
    "unique solutions to the 6-seed puzzles of figure  [ fig6 ] are given in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "for the star septoku problem in figure  [ fig11]b , rotate the board in figure figure  [ fig11]a @xmath36 clockwise , and then swap @xmath81 and @xmath1 ( apply the permutation @xmath82 ) . for",
    "the flower septoku problem in figure  [ fig12]b , simply label each circular region with the same pattern , the standard pattern shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is hard to believe that all these solutions are unique , but this has been confirmed by ip models .",
