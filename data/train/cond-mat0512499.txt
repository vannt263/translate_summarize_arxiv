    "the main goal of the spintronics is the manipulation of spins in semiconductor nanostructures . to this",
    "aim a large number of devices exploiting spin - orbit ( so ) interactions@xcite has been proposed .",
    "one of these interactions , known as `` rashba effect '' @xcite , appears at the interface of semiconductors lacking of structural inversion symmetry and its magnitude can be controlled by an applied gate voltage .",
    "the devices based on this effect use the quantum interference , due to the spin precession , beween different paths . among the others we remind the ballistic spin interferometer@xcite , in which a square loop is followed along a self - intersecting trajectory in clockwise and anticlockwise way ,",
    "that , recently , has been used to demonstrate experimentally the occurence of the spin precession interference phenomenon@xcite . in particular",
    ", the suppression of the altshuler  aronov  spivak ( aas ) oscillations@xcite allows the measurement of the magnitude of the rashba interaction , and koga et al .",
    "@xcite have obtained values in agree with theoretical estimates and with the weak antilocalization analysis . besides it has been shown",
    "that the rashba effect is also able to induce localization effects in quantum networks@xcite .",
    "the inversion asymmetry in the bulk semiconductor gives rise to spin - dependent bulk band structure . at the surface",
    "this so interaction , known as `` dresselhaus term '' @xcite , adds to the rashba term .",
    "recent measurements based on the spin - galvanic effect provided the ratio between magnitude of rashba and dresselhaus terms .",
    "this ratio can reach values as large as 2.14@xmath00.25 in inas quantum well@xcite .",
    "the rashba term is in general dominant but the dresselhaus interaction can have observable effects .    in a quantum wire",
    "the two so couplings yield together a spin precession depending on the angular position of the wire@xcite . in the experiments by ganichev et al.@xcite , a circularly polarized light produces a spin galvanic current whose intensity exhibits an angular dependence that allows the measure of the ratio between the so couplings .",
    "schliemann et al .",
    "@xcite have proposed a spin - field - effect transistor in which the presence of the two so couplings with equal magnitudes can give polarized currents whose spin does not depend on the momentum .",
    "in such a way the spin - independent scattering processes become ineffective in the particular direction in which the spin precession is suppressed .    in this paper",
    "we study the interference effects in one  dimensional loops due to spin precession when both the two so interactions are present .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in order",
    "to be self - contained in the section ii we recall a number of already known results@xcite that will be used to describe the spin precession in a quantum wire under the two so couplings@xcite . in the section iii",
    "we show how the localization in a polygonal loop can be achieved .",
    "we emphasize that for a diamond square loop with the diagonal oriented in [ 010 ] crystallografic direction there is a periodic set of values of the so strengths that gives perfect localization , i.e. the transmission coefficient vanishes .",
    "rotating the diamond square loop the localization is lost .",
    "we also show that for particular rhombic and exagonal loops the transmission vanishes only at specific values of the so strengths . in the section",
    "iv we consider what happens when a magnetic flux threads the loop , i.e. we analyse a ballistic spin interferometer with both the so couplings .",
    "particular attention will be paid to the suppression of the aas oscillations that appear when the input and the ouput node coincide .",
    "we will see how the so magnitudes ratio shifts the values of the rashba so strength at which the transmission becomes independent on the magnetic flux .",
    "finally we prove that the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillatons appearing when we inject and collect the current in opposite nodes , can be also modulated varying the two so couplings .",
    "the section v is dedicated to some concluding remarks .",
    "in order to set the notation let us remind the eigenstates and the energy eigenvalues of an electron confined in the @xmath1 plane and subjected to both rashba and dresselhaus spin - orbit interaction@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the rashba and the dresselhaus interactions , respectively .",
    "we have choosen the @xmath5axis and @xmath6axis in [ 010 ] and [ 100 ] crystallographic directions , respectively .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath7 \\left|   \\begin{array}{c } \\cos \\nu _ { \\pm } \\\\",
    "\\sin \\nu _ { \\pm } \\end{array } \\right|   \\label{eq3a}\\ ] ] are eigenfunctions of ( [ eq1 ] ) with eigenvalues given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is the modulus of the momentum in @xmath1 plane . in eq.([eq3a ] ) we have defined @xmath11 where @xmath12    we note that there are two values of @xmath13 corresponding to the same energy @xmath14 and they are given by @xmath15 with the corresponding energy that can be rewritten as @xmath16 the spinors @xmath17 of the two degenerate modes are orthogonal each other , being @xmath18 therefore we have @xmath19    it is worth to note that with the only rashba interaction @xmath20 we have @xmath21 we remind that the rashba so interaction can be viewed as a magnetic field parallel to the plane and orthogonal to the wavevector @xmath22 that orientates the spin along the direction perpendicular to the wave vector@xcite . in particular when the mode @xmath23 propagates in @xmath24direction the spinor @xmath25 @xmath26 is in the spin down state along @xmath6direction .",
    "on the other hand with only dresselhaus interaction @xmath27 we have @xmath28 and the so magnetic field is opposite to @xmath22 .",
    "now , when the mode @xmath29 propagates in @xmath5direction , @xmath25 @xmath30 @xmath31 and the spin is oriented along @xmath5axis .",
    "when both the so interactions are present the effective so magnetic field , parallel to the plane , fixes the spin direction according to eq.([eq4a ] ) .",
    "let us assume that an electron moves in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) ballistic quantum wire along an arbitrary @xmath32direction and subjected to spin - orbit interactions .",
    "moreover , we neglect the subband hybridization , induced by the spin - orbit coupling , assuming that the quantum wire is a truly 1d system because the spin  precession length @xmath33 is much larger than the wire width@xcite . within our approximation",
    "the spin - splitted bands have the orbital parts given by @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the coordinate along @xmath32direction ) .    in order to calculate the spin - orbit precession along the wire direction we proceed in the following way ( see also van veehuizen et al.@xcite ) .",
    "first of all we project an arbitrary input spin state in @xmath36 @xmath37 on @xmath17 spinors , obtaining @xmath38 where @xmath39 then , after a displacement @xmath40 along @xmath32direction , the electron will be in the state @xmath41 given by @xmath42 it easy to show that @xmath41 can be written in terms of the spin initial state @xmath43 @xmath44 introducing the spin operator @xmath45@xmath46 the eq.([eq5a ] ) can be also written as @xmath47 in the following we assume that @xmath48 because , in the realistic systems , the strength of so , @xmath49 , ranges from 0.01@xmath50 to 0.05@xmath50 , where @xmath50 is the fermi wavevector@xcite . therefore we take the orbital part with @xmath51 , neglecting terms of the second order in @xmath52 .",
    "then , only the spin operator @xmath45 depends on the angular position of the wire while the dynamical phase factor become equal to @xmath53 the matrix @xmath45 , actually , describes a geometrical rotation in the @xmath54spin space around the unitary vector @xmath55 of the angle @xmath56 in fact @xmath57 is the representation of the rotation operator@xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the unit matrix and @xmath60 is the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "we begin considering the square diamond loop of fig.1b ) . the dots a and b represent the input and the output leads , respectively . in the following we neglect backscattering effects at the contacts assuming that the electrons enter a with probability @xmath61 in the clockwise path ab and with probability @xmath61 in the counterclockwise path .",
    "the transmission amplitudes matrix @xmath62 in b is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the spin transmission matrix @xmath65 given by the interference between the different spin precessions along the two paths : @xmath66 it is simple to show that @xmath67 without the dresselhaus term ( @xmath68 ) the off diagonal elements of @xmath69 matrix vanish and the spin up and spin down states do not interfere . assuming that the input is an unpolarized statistical mixture @xmath70 the output will be described by@xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the coefficient transmission for an incoming spin up state and @xmath73 is that for an incoming spin down state .",
    "the spinors in @xmath74 are @xmath75 corresponding to input spin up and down , respectively .",
    "finally the transmission coefficient of the unpolarized electrons is @xmath76 @xmath77 neglecting the dresselhaus term ( @xmath78 ) , eq.([eq10 ] ) provides the known result @xmath79 that gives perfect localization ( @xmath80 ) when @xmath81@xcite .",
    "when we begin to add gradually the dresselhaus term , the perfect localization is lost and the zeroes of @xmath82 become transmission minima .",
    "increasing more and more the dresselhaus so strength the perfect localization is recovered when @xmath83 and a new set of @xmath80 points is obtained corresponding to @xmath84 as shown in fig.1a ) a further increase of @xmath85 generates a regular lattice of @xmath82 zeroes in the ( @xmath86 ) plane given by : @xmath87    this result shows that we can get perfect localization in the diamond loop of fig.1b with both the spin - orbit couplings . on the other hand",
    "we stress that the foregoing result depends strictly on the angular position of the loop with respect to the crystallographic axes of the substrate .",
    "indeed the geometry studied is somehow special . in order to consider a more general case we analyse the same square loop rotated by an angle @xmath88 with respect to @xmath5direction ( see the inset of fig.2a ) ) .",
    "the contour plots of @xmath82 as a function of @xmath88 and of @xmath89 are given in fig.2 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 there is no evidence of @xmath80 points at any @xmath93 as the fig.2a ) shows , only transmission minima are present in this case .",
    "when @xmath83 the zeroes of @xmath82 appear at @xmath94 which corresponds to align the diagonal of the square loop along the @xmath5direction ( fig.1b ) ) .",
    "this results confirm that we get perfect localization only for the pair ( @xmath89,@xmath95 shown in fig.1a ) : tilting the square the zeroes transform in minima .    in order to make our analysis more complete , we considered also the polygonal loops shown in the insets of fig.3 : a rhombus and a six sided cell .",
    "for the rhombus @xmath96 while for the exagonal loop we get @xmath97 from these transmission matrices the transmission coefficient for unpolarized electrons can be obtained as we have shown in eq.([eq10 ] ) .",
    "a careful analysis shows that specific values of @xmath98 exist such that , again , we get the perfect localization ( @xmath80 ) . for such values the vanishing of the transmission appears at some particular pairs of values ( @xmath99 ) that are not connected continously with the @xmath68 zeroes . in table 1",
    "we report the values of @xmath100 , @xmath98 and @xmath89 corresponding to a perfect localization @xmath80 for unpolarized electrons .",
    "the fig.3 reports contour plots of the transmission as a function of @xmath98 and @xmath89 at the indicated vaues of @xmath85 . the zeroes of @xmath82 appear as particular points at some specific values of the angle @xmath98 and of the spin - orbit strengths .",
    "a regular pattern of zeroes is a special feature of the square loop configuration of fig.1a ) and it is lost for other polygonal loop s shapes .",
    "in this section we discuss the effect of an external magnetic field @xmath102 on the transmission properties of a 1d loop under both rashba and dresselhaus interactions .",
    "we consider , first , a rhombic loop where the injection and the collection nodes coincide with the a node in the inset of fig.3a ( aa configuration ) .",
    "in other words we are supposing that there are two possible outputs at the collecting point , allowing the oscillation of the signal this geometry has recently proposed by koga et al.@xcite to obtain a ballistic spin interferometer where the collecting point is a splitter in both incoming and outgoing directions .",
    "they use the cancelation of the aas oscillations due to rashba so , in the square loop shown in the inset of fig.4a , to achieve an interferometric measure of so strength @xmath103nce , as we will show in eq.([eq12 ] ) , the transmission coefficient in presence of a magnetic field can be written in terms of that at zero magnetic field , we start to discuss the latter case . in the aa configuration",
    "the transmission amplitude matrix at zero magnetic field stems out from the interference between the clockwise ( cw ) and the counterclockwise ( ccw ) paths as @xmath104 @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 with @xmath108 it is worth to note that the input spin state is conserved and the transmission coefficient @xmath109 is plotted in fig.4a for @xmath110 and in fig.5a for @xmath111    in presence of a magnetic flux the matrix of the transmitted amplitudes is no longer diagonal and becomes : @xmath112 @xmath113 e^{i\\xi 4l }   \\label{eq12a}\\ ] ] @xmath114 with @xmath115 in eq.([eq12a ] ) the rhombus ( with area @xmath116 ) is threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the magnetic flux half quanta . the input spin state is no more conserved : the interference between cw and ccw paths is able to rotate the spin .",
    "the transmission coefficient for unpolarized electrons can be , then , written as @xmath119 as already mentioned , the aas oscillations are given by the term @xmath120 whose prefactor contains the zero field transmission @xmath121 , that is all we need to perform the analysis of the magnetic field effects . for a square loop ( @xmath110 ) and without the dresselhaus term ( @xmath78 )",
    "we recover the known result by koga et al.@xcite @xmath122 that is plotted in fig.4a ( dashed curve ) . the perfect localization ( @xmath123 )",
    "is obtained when @xmath124 at @xmath125 eq.([eq12 ] ) shows that when @xmath126 the aas oscillations are suppressed . on the other hand",
    "the transmission @xmath82 assumes the same costant value @xmath61 when @xmath127 and , at these magnetic fluxes , the modulation of the transmission due to so couplings is cancelled .",
    "koga , sekine and nitta@xcite have realized experimentally a rashba ballistic spin interferometer using a network of square loops .",
    "they measured the conductivity @xmath128 varying the magnetic field and controlling the strength of the rashba term by means of a gate voltage .",
    "assuming that the conductivity , in the ballistic regime , is proportional to the transmission coefficient ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "they searched the values of @xmath129 for which @xmath128 becomes independent on the magnetic field @xmath102 in a range around @xmath130 , and from these values they obtained a measure of rashba so strength @xmath131 .",
    "the zero field transmission when also the dresselhaus term is added ( for the square loop ) is shown in fig.4 .",
    "also in this case the aas oscillation are suppressed at the @xmath132 values for which @xmath133 the fig.4b shows the values of @xmath134 at which the suppression of aas is obtained as a function of the ratio between the dresselhaus and rashba strength , @xmath35 . increasing @xmath35 the period of @xmath121 decreases from the value @xmath135 at @xmath36 to lower values .",
    "the two zeroes of @xmath82 approach each other and disappear at @xmath136 for @xmath137 . for @xmath138 @xmath139 and",
    "the transmission coefficient becomes independent of the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the fig.4b shows that for @xmath140 we have four aas suppression points that become two when @xmath141 the cancellation of aas oscillations is not possible for greater values of dresselhaus strength ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "this analysis shows how relevant the inclusion of dresselhaus term is in order to describe in a proper way the aas suppression .",
    "furthermore our study allows an extension of the ballistic spin interferometric technique developed by koga et al .",
    "@xcite that could be used also to measure the ratio between the rashba and dresselhaus terms .    to investigate",
    "if the aas suppression depends on the shape of the interferometer we have taken into account a different rhombus geometry with @xmath143 the fig.5a shows the transmission at zero field , and the fig.5b shows how the suppression points change with @xmath35 .",
    "the cancellation of aas oscillation is still present though the pairs of values at which aas suppression occurs @xmath144 change modifying the shape .",
    "the supression remains also when the loop is rotated with respect to the substrate .    to conclude the analysis of the magnetic field effects",
    "let us consider what happens if the electrons are injected in the node a and collected in the opposite node b , traversing the square loop ( ab configuration ) . in this case",
    "the transmission amplitudes matrix is given by @xmath145 for unpolarized electrons the transmission coefficient becomes @xmath146 the factor @xmath147 describes the aharonov - bohm oscillations@xcite , which present a double period with respect to the aas oscillations , and , again , his prefactor is fixed by the zero field transmission @xmath148 that regulates the amplitude of ab oscillation .",
    "this quantity is plotted in fig.6a . as for the foregoing aa configuration",
    "@xmath149 implies that @xmath150 for any @xmath151 and the ratio @xmath152 can be fixed in such a way that the ab oscillations are cancelled .",
    "therefore , the suppression takes place at @xmath129 values satisfying the equation @xmath153 the behaviour of the ab square configuration is shown in fig.6 .",
    "in conclusion we have studied the interference effects due to the rashba and the dresselhaus so interactions in quantum wires forming polygonal loops .",
    "the spin precession along the sides of the loop gives rise to perfect localization at particular values of the pair ( @xmath85 , @xmath89 ) .",
    "for the square diamond loop we achieve the perfect localization for pairs @xmath154 belonging to a square lattice that is symmetrical with respect to the two so strengths @xmath131 and @xmath155 .",
    "the periodic pattern of the transmission zeroes@xcite obtained with only the rashba so interaction@xcite , is preserved adding dresselhaus so coupling .",
    "the configuration with the square diagonal parallel to @xmath5axis ( in [ 010 ] crystallographic direction ) is a special case and when the square is rotated in @xmath1 plane the zeroes of @xmath82 transform in minima and the perfect localization is lost .",
    "we have studied other two geometries : a rhombus and an exagonal cell . for both cases",
    "pairs @xmath156 exist that give the perfect localization only for a specific shape ( we characterize the shape with an angular opening @xmath98 ) .",
    "we have found triplets @xmath157 that give transmission zeroes .",
    "this behaviour suggests that the perfect localization in a circular loop is not easy to predict .",
    "in particular , the procedure discussed in ref.@xcite in the case of rashba coupling , where perfect localization in a circle is obtained as a limit of a succession of regular polygons , can not be applied in the same way .",
    "the perfect localization on a circle with both the so couplings will be matter of future research .",
    "when the loop is plunged in an external magnetic field the transmission coefficient oscillates with the magnetic flux passing through the loop .",
    "the amplitude of this oscillation depends on the strengths of the two so couplings . injecting and collecting the electrons at the same loop node ( the interfering paths are self - itersecting ones )",
    ", the 1d loop behaves as a ballistic spin interferometer . with this configuration",
    "the aas oscillations appear and , in presence of rashba so , they are suppressed for some particular values of @xmath89@xcite .",
    "we have considered an interferometer with the shape of a rhombus with both the so interactions .",
    "the suppression appears at @xmath89 values which depend on the ratio @xmath100 . so that the interferometric experimental technique of koga et al.@xcite could be used to measure not only the @xmath131 value but also the ratio @xmath100 .",
    "an other kind of magnetic modulation of the transmission coefficient are the ab oscillations whose period is the double of the aas oscillations .",
    "they appear when the electrons are injected and collected at opposite nodes of the loop and the interfering paths of equal length surrond the loop area . again",
    "the presence of the dresselhaus coupling can regulate the amplitude of these oscillations .",
    "our results concern a single loop .",
    "when the loops are arranged in a quantum network the transport properties through the system may change as discussed , for the rashba so case in refs .",
    "we also expect that the use of more realistic boundary conditions could be important , for example the finite coupling with leads can give resonances representing quasibound states within the loop .",
    "to conclude we briefly discuss the consequences of higher order winding contributions and backscattering .",
    "the simplest way to deal with this question is to combine the multiple scattering against the injection node and the collector node incoherently@xcite .",
    "then the single scattering event can be characterized with a classical probability .",
    "we identify the probability that the electron leaves a node with the transmission coefficients @xmath82 that we have calculated before , the classical reflection probability being @xmath158 .",
    "the round trips can be arranged into a geometrical series@xcite whose sum gives the composite exit probability @xmath159@xmath160    we note that @xmath161 implies that also @xmath162 .",
    "the total transmission @xmath159 keeps the periodicity in @xmath151 although the dependence on @xmath151 is no more simply @xmath120 or @xmath163 as before .",
    "therefore , this assumption of incoherence predicts that the perfect localization and the suppression of aas and ab oscillations are not spoiled by incoherent multiple scattering .",
    "the transmission @xmath159 becomes independent on @xmath151 @xmath164at some particular values @xmath89 in the same way as @xmath165 with the same dependence on the ratio @xmath152 , but the value of @xmath166 at the suppression lowers from @xmath61 to @xmath167 .          1",
