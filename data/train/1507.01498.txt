    "in the past decades , laser cooling of atoms has given rise to fascinating new fields in atomic physics and has defined very active research lines in many related fields ( see for instance the latest annual review  @xcite ) .",
    "if several atomic species can be nowadays laser cooled using well established laser schemes , still most have never been manipulated in this way , essentially because of a lack of suitable and affordable laser radiation . in this framework ,",
    "an innovative cooling scheme for iron atoms has been recently proposed on the basis of 2 ultraviolet transitions at 372 and 358  nm , both accessible with commercial laser systems  @xcite .",
    "iron atom is a quite challenging atomic species for laser cooling .",
    "one of the main reasons comes from the lack of a suitable cooling transition from the ground state . a good transition for that purpose is rather provided by the @xmath0 transition at 358  nm  @xcite , whose lower state lies at 6928  @xmath8 above ground state ( @xmath9 )  @xcite and is metastable with a lifetime of the order of several hundred seconds  @xcite .",
    "the atoms can be optically pumped to this lower state from the fe  i ground state through the 372-nm @xmath10 resonance line  @xcite .",
    "the transition @xmath11 at 501  nm can then serve as a good decay channel to finalize the optical pumping from the ground state .",
    "iron has four stable isotopes @xmath12fe , @xmath13fe , @xmath6fe and @xmath14fe , where @xmath6fe is the only one to have a nonzero nuclear spin @xmath15 and to form a fermion . in view of isotopically selective laser cooling experiments with iron ,",
    "it is of primary importance to accurately know the isotopic effects on both the fe  i 372- and 358-nm transitions .",
    "the case of the 372-nm transition was studied in details in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the 358-nm transition about which nothing is currently known .",
    "we report the measurement of the isotope shifts between all four stable iron isotopes , as well as the related hyperfine structure for @xmath6fe .",
    "the experimental setup differs significantly from that used for the study of the 372-nm transition  @xcite .",
    "if the latter was based on a saturated - absorption spectroscopy system using an fe - ar hollow cathode , this scheme is hardly conceivable for the 358-nm transition since the energy of the lower state prevents it from being sufficiently populated in a hollow cathode operating continuously so as to generate detectable saturated - absorption signals .",
    "we used instead a laser - induced fluorescence scheme on an iron atomic beam produced in a high temperature oven filled with both natural and enriched samples of iron .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , our experimental setup is described .",
    "we then expose our results and their analysis in sec .",
    "we finally draw conclusions in sec .  iv .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .  [ setup ] .",
    "the radiation at 358  nm was produced by a frequency doubled coherent@xmath16 ti : sapphire ( ti : sa ) laser set to 716  nm and pumped with a coherent@xmath16 compact solid - state diode - pumped frequency - doubled nd : vanadate ( nd : yvo4 ) laser at 532 nm .",
    "the linewidth of the ti : sa laser was specified to be less than 1  mhz .",
    "the laser radiations at 716  nm and at 358  nm were sent simultaneously to a saturation - spectroscopy setup on a molecular iodine cell and to a laser - induced fluorescence setup on an iron atomic beam , respectively . in this way ,",
    "synchronized spectra of both molecular iodine and atomic iron at frequencies in a strict relation of 2 ( within some fixed frequency shift of only a few hundred mhz induced by the presence of acousto - optical modulators ( aom ) in the setup ) could be recorded by scanning the ti : sa frequency .",
    "the molecular iodine spectra served as a calibration for the iron spectra .",
    "this was made possible since molecular iodine has precisely a 15-hyperfine - component line at almost exactly half the frequency of the analyzed iron line , namely the transition @xmath17 at 13957.8542(50 )  @xmath8  @xcite , whereas half the wavenumber of the 358-nm iron line reads 13957.8445(11 )  @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine structure of the @xmath18 iodine transition was studied in details in ref .",
    "a description of the saturation spectroscopy setup can be found in this reference and will not be repeated here .",
    "the fraction of the laser radiation at 716  nm sent to the molecular iodine saturation spectroscopy setup amounted typically to 100  mw .",
    "the laser - induced fluorescence setup consisted of an iron atomic beam produced in a high temperature oven and directed through a 16-mm wide tube to an observation chamber where the 358-nm laser radiation crossed at right angle the atomic beam .",
    "the oven was operated at temperatures ranging from 1920  k to 1970  k to ensure a sufficient atomic flux .",
    "it yielded a statistical population of the lower state of the studied 358-nm iron line of about 0.35  % .",
    "the center of the observation chamber was located at @xmath19  m of the oven aperture ( 2 mm in diameter ) , thereby limiting the atomic beam half divergence angle to a value not exceeding 0.4@xmath20 . to increase the signal - to - noise ratio , the laser beam power in the observation chamber",
    "was stabilized to about @xmath21  @xmath22w using a proportional - integral - derivative ( pid ) controller regulating the acoustic wave intensity in an acousto - optical modulator ( aom 3 in fig .  [ setup ] )",
    "so as to keep constant the power of the first order diffracted beam , as measured by a photodiode located at the exit of the observation chamber .",
    "the servo - loop had a time constant of about 20  @xmath22s .",
    "the laser beam section in the observation chamber was @xmath23 mm@xmath24 .",
    "the laser - induced fluorescence light emitted by the atoms was observed perpendicularly to both the laser and atomic beams through a large numerical aperture @xmath25 ( 0.33  sr ) imaging system .",
    "the light was collected to a photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) covered with a 10-nm bandwidth interference filter to limit the background light at its input .",
    "the signal of the pmt was averaged by a boxcar averager .    : half - wave plate , @xmath26 : quarter - wave plate , @xmath27 : 50% transmission plate beamsplitter , cl : converging lens , m : mirror , p : polarizer , pbs : polarizing beamsplitter , oi : optical isolator , pd : photodiode , pid : proportional - integral - derivative controller , pmt : photomultiplier tube , i@xmath28 : molecular iodine cell).[setup],width=264 ]",

    "the lower frequency peak is the same transition for the isotope @xmath12fe .",
    "the two little peaks towards the higher frequencies are two hyperfine components of the @xmath6fe transition . because of its very low abundance , the contribution of the isotope @xmath14fe is not visible on the spectrum .",
    "the fluorescence peaks had a linewidth of about 36  mhz .",
    "this value comes from the natural linewidth ( 16.20(45 )  mhz  @xcite ) , power broadened up to about 19  mhz , and from the atomic beam divergence broadening effect .",

    ", the intensity of the @xmath14fe contribution is approximately equal to the @xmath12fe and @xmath13fe lines , while the two peaks related to the @xmath6fe hyperfine structure are enhanced in accordance with the chosen abundance in the home - made iron powder .",
    "the intensity of the 57(2 ) peak is approximately equal to 75% of the 57(1 ) peak s .",
    "it is a bit lower than the expected 84.4% theoretical intensity , but the difference is easily explained from an optical pumping phenomenon between the @xmath42 and @xmath43 hyperfine states of the @xmath44 lower energy level .",
    "when passing through the laser beam tuned to resonance with the 57(2 ) hyperfine transition , some atoms of the atomic beam get lost from the fluorescence process when they decay through the very weak 57(3 ) hyperfine transition and accumulate little by little in the @xmath44 @xmath45 state .",
