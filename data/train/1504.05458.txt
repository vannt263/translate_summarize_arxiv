    "recent experiments demonstrated the feasibility of ultrashort attosecond laser pulses and their use in combination with other optical pump - probe techniques to access various facets of the electronic and ionic dynamics  @xcite .",
    "of a special relevance here are strongly time - asymmetric pulses .",
    "the simplest example is a mono cycle , time asymmetric pulse for which one half cycle could be short and strong and the other half cycle could be longer but weaker in a way that the time integral over the electric field amplitude vanishes , as required for a propagating pulse .",
    "when interacting with matter , the effect of two half cycles could be quite different  @xcite .",
    "for instance , if the first half cycle ( with duration @xmath0 ) is shorter than the time of relevant transitions taking place in the system , whilst the second , weaker half cycle is much longer , then the effect of the whole pulse is mainly governed by the first half cycle of the pulse ( hcp ) .",
    "henceforth we refer to this situation as the hcp case .",
    "the second half cycle may act as an off - set dc tail ( if weak / long enough ) . in this limit",
    "it is convenient and sometime sufficient to introduce theoretically the notion of hcp kick as a useful idealization of the action of the whole pulse  @xcite : namely , in the hcp case , the system is insensitive to the details of the pulse temporal shape .",
    "this allows relating the action of hcp to that of a kick , i.e. , a @xmath1 function in time .",
    "substantial simplifications of the triggered quantum dynamics follow then",
    ". we will demonstrate below that by performing measurements in an appropriate setup on the system immediately after such an excitation allows to infer the strength of the electronic correlation in the system and its dependency on the internal structure , and to quantify the entanglement .",
    "the experimental arrangement that we suggest is the following : we start from the ground state , of say some molecular structure ( another stationary case is also possible ) and `` shake '' the electronic system by a weak but short hcp .",
    "as the system evolves and possibly dissociates we measure , e.g. , via the time - resolved photoemission  @xcite the initial - state remaining , i.e. what we will call the _ survival probability_. detecting only the kinetic energies of the dissociating ions upon the kick , one may access information on the ionic time evolution that can be used when measuring the time - resolved survival probability as a function of the molecular bond ( since at this particular time one has information on the molecular bond distance ) .",
    "currently we are not aware of any corresponding experiment to this proposal , however , the ingredients of the suggested setup , such as hcp , time - resolved photoemission were demonstrated  @xcite . from the survival probability we deduce",
    "features akin to the reduced two - particle density matrix .",
    "specifically , the envisaged experiment should measure upon the kick the initial state occupation probability as a function of the evolving internuclear distance .",
    "it is this quantity which we calculated numerically and will be discussing below . knowing ( from theory or experiment  @xcite molecular bond distance upon the non - resonant pulse excitation",
    "we can so image the time evolution of the survival probability .",
    "we relate it below to the reduced two - particle density matrix which vanishes for the single determinantal states and , thus , can be used as a measure of electronic correlations .",
    "so the key point of this study is how to measure and quantify electronic correlations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we give an explicit expression for the probability of the system to remain in its ground state after the application of a @xmath1-like pulse . while for one - electron systems the quantum dynamics was discussed by many authors",
    "the nontrivial part tackled here is the many - body nature of the problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec : measure ] we put the discussed probability in the context of other proposed measures of electronic correlations : the frobenius norm of the second _ cumulant matrix _ and the _ von neumann entropy_. stretching molecular bonds incur in general a change in the amount of correlations in the electronic subsystem .",
    "the proposed experiment is illustrated by numerical simulations which show what a possible outcome may be expected ( sec .",
    "[ sec : study ] ) .",
    "the dependence of different correlation measures on the interatomic distances is studied , and analytical expressions in the asymptotic regime are obtained . additionally , our calculations allow to test numerically for important inequalities for the entropy measures .",
    "consider an @xmath2-electron system in its ground state .",
    "its electronic properties are completely described by the many - body wave function @xmath3 .",
    "although the choice of the gauge is irrelevant for the present discussion we will assume here the light - matter interaction to be given in the length gauge by the dipole operators @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes a projection ( determined by the pulse polarization ) .",
    "the coupling operators are of one - particle type , hermitian ( @xmath6 ) and of vector character . by choosing a suitable one - particle basis we can cast the light - matter interaction in the second - quantized form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 are the components of the electric field vector .",
    "acting on the system with a pulse that has the time - dependence @xmath9 with a peak amplitude at @xmath10 , we can write the state of the system at @xmath11 shortly after the pulse as @xmath12 @xmath13 is a regularized version of the mathematical @xmath1-function on @xmath14 $ ] interval and @xmath15 has a dimension of the action ( we use atomic units throughout the text ) . mapping the pulse generated state on the ground ( initial ) state @xmath16 ,",
    "i.e. , taking the overlap @xmath17 of we obtain the survival ( recurrence ) probability to be in @xmath16 after the pulse .",
    "this quantity is central to the following discussion .",
    "the _ quantum - mechanical _ average of the operator @xmath18 can be treated like any statistical average using the _ cumulant expansion _ : @xmath19 the correlation functions are well known :    [ eq : corr ] @xmath20    these averages can be computed in terms of reduced density matrices ( rdm )    [ eq : defd ] @xmath21    in order to do so we need some additional notations for operators .",

    "we find by direct comparison @xmath45 .",
    "it is , however , the second cumulant that gives the lowest order ( in @xmath46 ) contribution to the survival probability , namely @xmath47 thus , @xmath48 can be written as the averaged value of a two - body operator ( first term in eq .  ) , whereas @xmath49\\rangle -\\langle[\\hat    s]\\rangle^2 $ ] is computed from 1-rdm .",
    "this equation can be written in an alternative form .",
    "consider the natural orbital basis ( i.e. a basis in which 1-rdm is diagonal ) : @xmath50\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_{im}(s_{im}s_{mi}f_i - s_{ii}s_{mm}f_if_m)\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\sum_{ijkl}s_{ij}s_{kl}{^2\\!\\delta^{ik}_{jl}}+\\sum_{im}|s_{im}|^2f_i(1-f_m),\\label{eq : res2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the occupation number of the @xmath52th natural orbital . despite the fact that the second term in eq",
    ".   has a form of the _ fermi golden rule _",
    "the latter is only valid for sufficiently long pulses ( adiabatic switching ) .",
    ".   is a quite remarkable result as it allows to express the averaged 2-rdm in terms of experimentally measurable quantities : the survival probability and the mean square deviation of an excitation operator .",
    "alternatively , one can use the form   to access the @xmath53 cumulant as a correction to the single - particle result . a possible experiment that we sketched in the introduction ,",
    "could be a pump - probe setup in which the system is excited non - resonantly by a half - cycle pump pulse and the probe laser pulse is used to monitor the ground state occupation .",
    "we envisage an application to molecular systems in which the amount of electronic correlations and , thus , @xmath54\\rangle$ ] are driven by changes of geometry . on the other hand , the one - body part @xmath55 is a quantity that is weakly dependent on the geometric configuration ( see also the discussion below ) and can also be easily computed  .    for a faithful correlation measure it is desirable to minimize the artifacts coming from the dependence of @xmath25 on the system s geometry .",
    "consider a system subject to stretching .",
    "the values of the matrix elements @xmath56 can be quite large as compared to the equilibrium geometry .",
    "correspondingly , the value of @xmath48 obtained according to eqs .  ,   will be at variance with the equilibrium value  the effect that is not necessarily reflecting properties of @xmath53 .",
    "it is possible , however , to suppress to some extent the large contributions to @xmath48 originating from the diagonal matrix elements of @xmath57 .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by performing the experiment with oriented systems and applying the hcp field in the direction for which @xmath58 .",
    "such condition is always possible to achieve for systems which contain @xmath59 as their symmetry subgroup and is quite common . under this condition",
    "also @xmath55 is weakly dependent on the geometry .",
    "is it possible to devise a measurement that exclusively probes the cumulant density matrix @xmath60 ?",
    "our answer to this question is negative , based on the fact that the generating functional for the cumulant and the reduced density matrices @xmath61 is different from the bosonic - like generator of the evolution operator  . in other words , in order to probe the fermionic rdms one needs a direct coupling to fermionic degrees of freedom as grassmann variables @xmath62 in eq .",
    "realize .",
    "nonetheless , we will demonstrate below using two numerical examples that the survival probability is a versatile measure of electronic correlations and will compare it to other proposed measures of electronic correlations and entanglement .",
    "it was shown by juhsz and mazziotti  @xcite that the frobenius norm of the second cumulant matrix ( @xmath63 $ ] ) possesses a number of properties that make it a useful measure .",
    "@xmath64 scales linearly with the system size and vanishes for single - determinant states .",
    "although it is well suited to compare different configurations of the same system such a measure is less suited to compare different systems as its upper limit is not known . + here come informational measures into play , e.  g. _ von neumann entropy _ .",
    "the entropies based on the 1-rdm have been widely studied .",
    "less known are the entropies based on 2-rdm .",
    "carlen and lieb  @xcite considered recently the bipartite fermionic states and proved several bounds for the entropy based on @xmath65 . for a hilbert space of the @xmath66 hamiltonian and corresponding @xmath67 density matrix",
    "the von neumann entropy can be computed as @xmath68 where the trace is understood in the sense of the tensor product @xmath69 .",
    "the 2-rdm of a @xmath2-particle fermionic system can be considered as a density matrix of a bipartite fermionic state . for this case",
    "the following bounds are known ( cf .",

    "we will focus on molecular systems with equal number of spin up ( @xmath71 ) and spin down ( @xmath72 ) electrons . to treat such systems",
    "it is convenient to work in the closed shell hartree - fock ( rhf ) molecular orbital ( mo ) basis , distinguish spin up and spin down mo states and to denote them as @xmath52 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "this implies some additional symmetries . obviously , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and we have the following blocks for the 2-rdms : @xmath76 and same holds for the cumulants . since 2-rdms in eq",

    "we separately compute the electronic correlation measures associated with aa and ab blocks .    for the computation of entropies",

    "[ fig : h6](b , c ) when @xmath148 is increased beyond @xmath149   and the flatness at these distances of the corresponding potential energy surface , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : h6_pes ] . even though the electrostatics is less relevant at these distances , the non - local nature imposed by the ( anti)symmetry on the total wave function persists for the isolated expanding system .",
    "this means on the other hand , that the asymptotic values of the entropy and @xmath150 delivers short - range ( atomistic ) information .",
    "this picture might change in a nontrivial way when coupling the electronic and the ionic system to external baths , in particular if the bath implies some spin - flip scattering .",
    "we explored theoretically the possibility of accessing the electron correlations using a pump - probe technique with half - cycle pulses .",
    "the non - resonant kick - type excitation is appropriate in sofar as it allows for many - particle excitations and can still be amenable to quasi - analytical treatment .",
    "we demonstrated that to the leading order in the field intensity , the probability for a system to remain and/or recur to the initial state ( the survival probability ) can be expressed in terms of 2-rdm and , hence , represents a measure for electronic correlations .",
    "exact diagonalization studies were performed on two molecules lih and h@xmath90  prototypes of systems with importance from the point view of dynamic and static correlations . in the dissociative limit the second system permits for an analytical treatment of some electronic ( asymptotic ) states for which different correlational measures and entanglement entropies were computed . even though these asymptotic subsystems can be considered as noninteracting",
    ", the states are entangled due to the wave - function anti - symmetry .",
    "this is reflected in the two - particle entropy , the frobenius norm of the second cumulant matrix @xmath64 and in the expectation value of the @xmath101 operator .",
    "the latter can be inferred from the proposed measurement of the survival probability .",
    "thus corresponding experiments can probe the spin configuration of many - body systems .",
