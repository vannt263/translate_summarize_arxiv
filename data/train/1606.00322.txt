    "bars are characteristic components of many disk galaxies . their abundance estimates vary , depending on the criteria and method employed , the fraction of barred galaxies ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 of disk galaxies ( * ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . for bright dwarf galaxies in the virgo cluster",
    ", @xcite found the bar fraction of @xmath6 .",
    "bars can be formed via an instability occurring in a stellar disk . in the beginning , the bar grows very fast , but soon after it buckles out of the disk plane @xcite .",
    "later on , it experiences a secular evolution phase , lengthening gradually and slowing down , i.e. decreasing its pattern speed @xmath7 . for reviews on the subject of bars , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "bars can also be formed through tidal interactions of large disk galaxies @xcite , either as a result of an encounter with a smaller perturbing galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or perturbations from a galaxy cluster @xcite . however , it is not entirely clear whether the bars formed in this way have the same dynamical properties as bars formed in isolation .",
    "for example , @xcite argued that they have different shapes of the density profiles . on the other hand , @xcite claimed that bars formed in isolation and in interactions have the same or similar dynamical properties and that this made it very difficult ( if at all possible ) to distinguish between the two formation channels .",
    "most of the studies agree that the bars formed tidally have smaller pattern speeds @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite claimed that the tidally induced bars end at the inner lindblad resonance , whereas the bars formed in isolation extend up to roughly @xmath8 to @xmath9 of the corotation resonance @xcite .",
    "moreover , the properties of the bars formed via interactions seem to depend on the tidal force strength @xcite .",
    "if the interaction is weak , then the tidal force merely induces the instability and the bar parameters are set by the properties of the disk , whereas for the stronger interaction , its properties are determined by the encounter .    in the tidal stirring scenario for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ,",
    "initially disky dwarfs are captured by larger hosts ( like the milky way ) and transformed into spheroids by the tidal forces @xcite .",
    "an intermediate stage of this process is the formation of a bar in the dwarf galaxy , which should still exist and be observable in some dwarf spheroidals of the local group . indeed ,",
    "good candidates for such bar - like systems exist , including the sagittarius , ursa minor and carina dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the elongated shapes of some recently discovered ultra - faint dwarf galaxies , like hercules @xcite and ursa major ii @xcite , also indicate possible presence of bars .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed an @xmath0-body simulation of a dwarf galaxy on an elongated , prograde orbit around a milky way - like host . in this simulation ,",
    "the bar formed after the first pericenter passage and during subsequent encounters with the host it was shortened and weakened .",
    "it also experienced a buckling episode after the second pericenter .",
    "its properties changed abruptly at pericenter passages but were relatively stable between them . in a follow - up study",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that the efficiency of bar formation depends very strongly on the initial inclination of the dwarf galaxy disk and the bar does not form in exactly retrograde configurations .",
    "early studies of the orbital structure of bars concentrated on periodic orbits in potentials resembling observed galaxies .",
    "@xcite described four main orbital families in 2d bars .",
    "the x@xmath1 orbits are elongated in the same direction as the bar . at their ends",
    "they may have cusps or even small loops .",
    "two other families are perpendicular to the bar : x@xmath10 orbits are stable , while x@xmath11 are unstable .",
    "the last family identified included orbits named x@xmath12 , which are not far from circular and , importantly , retrograde with respect to the bar rotation .",
    "stars in a given potential should mainly follow orbits with shapes contributing to the density distribution generating the potential .",
    "thus , it was argued that bars should be mostly made of x@xmath1-related orbits @xcite .",
    "this finding was afterwards confirmed by a 2d @xmath0-body simulation performed by @xcite .",
    "later analyses studied the impact of the third ( vertical ) dimension on the orbital structure .",
    "@xcite noted that the main 3d orbits contributing to their @xmath0-body bar , when viewed edge - on , were banana - shaped or had a shape of the infinity symbol .",
    "they were named ban and aban orbits , respectively , as an extension of the @xcite notation , where the x@xmath1 orbits were named as b. an exhaustive classification of non - planar orbits was performed by @xcite , who extended the notation of @xcite to three dimensions and thus introduced the x@xmath1v@xmath1 , x@xmath1v@xmath10 etc .",
    "families .",
    "one of the methods to study particle orbits relies on the analysis of dominant frequencies @xcite .",
    "it is based on finding peaks in the fourier spectrum of a given coordinate time series .",
    "if two frequencies are commensurate , then in a given reference frame the orbit is periodic , i.e. it will close after some time and repeat itself .",
    "in the case of bars , following @xcite , the orbits are usually described in terms of the epicycle frequency @xmath13 and the angular frequency @xmath14 . when the vertical structure is also studied , the vertical frequency is added . as was found by many studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the highest peak in the distribution of frequency ratios occurs at @xmath15 .",
    "the proposed interpretation of this fact was that those orbits are x@xmath1-related , i.e. during one orbital period they experience two radial oscillations .    in most of the studies of orbits performed to date",
    "the orbits were analyzed in a frozen potential .",
    "a common approach is to extract a snapshot from an @xmath0-body simulation , calculate the ( often symmetrized ) potential and let it rotate with the pattern speed of the bar .",
    "then the trajectories of selected particles are followed in such a non - evolving setting .",
    "one of the few studies adopting a different approach was performed by @xcite who studied actual particle orbits in an ongoing @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "this leads to a considerably worse resolution in comparison with using a frozen potential because of the ubiquitous secular evolution , but this resolution is sufficient for our purposes . however , their results were in broad agreement with previous works .",
    "knowledge of the orbital structure of a galaxy can be useful in many ways .",
    "orbits are building blocks of the density distribution and are used in the @xcite modelling of barred galaxies @xcite . the high velocity feature in the milky way bar @xcite",
    "is claimed to be explained by the contribution from some particular orbit types @xcite .",
    "the gas flow in barred galaxies is also directly related to the periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "all the above works , however , pertain to bars in galaxies of milky way type , while no study so far addressed the orbital structure in barred dwarf galaxies . in this paper",
    "we extend the work of @xcite by an in - depth study of stellar orbits in the tidally induced bar using the dominant frequency analysis .",
    "our purpose is to establish whether the orbital structure of such a bar is similar to the one of previously studied bars formed in isolation . in section [ sec_methods ]",
    "we characterize the simulation used and describe the details of our frequency analysis method . in section [ sec_results ]",
    "we present the results , starting with an overview of shapes of the individual stellar orbits .",
    "then , we analyze a large number of orbits and study their properties .",
    "next , we classify the orbits in terms of their shapes and frequency ratios and quantify their contribution depending on the distance from the center of the dwarf .",
    "we finish this section with the description of orbits which buckle out of the disk plane .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_discussion ] we discuss our results and compare them to previous works .",
    "the paper is concluded with a summary in section [ sec_summary ] .",
    "we reanalyzed the @xmath0-body simulation of an interaction between a dwarf galaxy and its host , previously described in @xcite .",
    "it employed a milky way - like galaxy model , made of an nfw @xcite dark matter halo and an exponential stellar disk .",
    "the halo had mass @xmath16 m@xmath17 and concentration @xmath18 .",
    "the disk had mass @xmath19 m@xmath17 , the radial scale - length of @xmath20 kpc and thickness of @xmath21 kpc .",
    "the model of the dwarf galaxy was also two - component .",
    "its nfw halo had mass @xmath22 m@xmath17 and concentration @xmath23 .",
    "the dwarf s disk had mass of @xmath24 m@xmath17 , the radial scale - length of @xmath21 kpc and thickness of @xmath25 kpc .",
    "each galaxy was built as an equilibrium @xmath0-body realization of @xmath26 particles per component ( @xmath27 particles in total ) .",
    "the dwarf was initially placed at the apocenter of an elongated , prograde orbit , with the apocenter distance of @xmath28  kpc and pericenter of @xmath29 kpc .",
    "the simulation , followed for @xmath30 gyr , was performed using publicly available code gadget2 @xcite .",
    "the adopted softening lengths were , respectively , @xmath31 kpc and @xmath32  kpc for the halo and the disk of the host galaxy , and @xmath33 kpc and @xmath34 kpc for the halo and the disk of the dwarf .",
    "we rerun the simulation and saved outputs every @xmath35 gyr , i.e. ten times more frequently than in @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , in this simulation the initially axisymmetric disk of the dwarf galaxy forms a bar after the first pericenter passage . during subsequent encounters with the host",
    ", the bar gets shorter and thicker . for the purpose of the present study , it seems to be most appropriate to consider the bar when it is the strongest and for a period of time when it remains approximately unaltered .",
    "thus , we chose the period between the first ( @xmath36 gyr ) and the second ( @xmath37 gyr ) pericenter passage .     +         in order to study orbits in an environment that changes as little as possible with time , we determined the period when the bar rotates with an approximately constant pattern speed . for this purpose ,",
    "for each simulation output we calculated the principal axes and axis ratios from the shape tensor , using the method of @xcite as implemented by @xcite and taking into account the stellar particles in an ellipsoid of mean radius equal to @xmath38 kpc . during the studied period ,",
    "the disk is tilted by a few degrees with respect to the initial plane and precesses . in order to correct for this , we had to find a time - averaged disk plane .    in the top panel of figure [ fig_major_axis ] we plot the position angle @xmath39 of the bar major axis . in the time interval of 1.4 - 3.0 gyr",
    "it is well approximated by a linear function @xmath40 . in the bottom panel of figure [ fig_major_axis ]",
    "we show the pattern speed @xmath7 calculated from the simulation , along with the one obtained from the fit . in the considered period of time",
    "the pattern speed fluctuates a little , but is fairly constant , therefore we adopt the fitted value as the pattern speed of the bar .",
    "we note that a constant pattern speed is not a common feature of bars formed in isolation .",
    "usually , the bar slows down during its evolution ; initially it decelerates strongly and later on , in the secular evolution phase , the slowdown is more gradual ( * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the lack of detectable bar slowdown could well argue for a different angular momentum redistribution than in isolated galaxies , which may involve an angular momentum exchange with the host galaxy . for a bar formed through interaction",
    "@xcite also found that the pattern speed seems to be rather constant in time .",
    "figure [ fig_density_maps ] shows surface density maps of the stellar component of the dwarf galaxy after 2.2 gyr of evolution , when the dwarf is at the second apocenter of the orbit .",
    "the coordinate system used in this figure will be used throughout the paper : the @xmath41 axis is aligned with the bar major axis , the @xmath42 axis with the intermediate and @xmath43 with the minor one , perpendicular to the disk . in the face - on view",
    "the bar is clearly visible in the center . at some distance",
    "the contours begin to twist and the disk starts to dominate while at the outskirts the tidal tails are discernible .",
    "the bar has not yet undergone the buckling instability , hence it does not have a boxy / peanut shape in the edge - on view .    ,",
    "red ) and intermediate to longest ( @xmath44 , green ) , supplemented with the triaxiality parameter ( @xmath45 , blue ) for the bar at the apocenter of the dwarf s orbit ( at @xmath46 gyr ) .",
    "all quantities are shown as a function of distance from the dwarf center measured along its major axis . ]    in the following , we are going to study the orbits as a function of their distance from the center of the dwarf .",
    "thus , it would be useful to know if there are any changes of the bar shape with radius and how long the bar is . using the method mentioned before , we calculated the axis ratios as a function of distance measured along the bar major axis .",
    "in figure [ fig_shape_x ] we plot the ratios of the minor to major axis ( @xmath47 ) , intermediate to major axis ( @xmath44 ) and the triaxiality parameter @xmath48/[1-(c / a)^2]$ ] .",
    "if @xmath49 , the object can be considered oblate , if @xmath50 it is triaxial and finally if @xmath51 the stellar distribution is prolate , i.e. bar - like .    the @xmath47 ratio , i.e.  the thickness of the galaxy , is approximately constant over the whole dwarf . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath44 ratio varies significantly .",
    "it decreases slowly in the inner parts but then increases rapidly , which signifies the transition to the disk .",
    "further away it drops again as we move from the main body of the galaxy to the tidal tails .",
    "these changes of @xmath44 are reflected in the variation of the @xmath45 parameter . in the inner part , dominated by the bar ,",
    "@xmath45 is almost constant ( or even grows slightly ) and is of the order of @xmath52 .",
    "further away it falls below @xmath53 , which means that the dwarf s shape becomes triaxial at this radius . at large distance",
    ", @xmath45 grows again above @xmath53 , indicating the transition to the tidal tails .",
    "unfortunately , there is no unique method to measure the bar length and the existing ones give various estimates @xcite .",
    "we base our estimate of the bar length on the behavior of @xmath45 ( for a similar approach based on ellipticity and other methods see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath45 decreases , it crosses the value of @xmath54 at @xmath55 kpc , and the shape stops being triaxial ( @xmath56 ) at @xmath31 kpc .",
    "we also checked how the orientation of the major axis of the stellar density distribution changes with radius .",
    "its direction turns out to be very stable up to @xmath57 kpc , and only then starts to change slowly so that at @xmath31 kpc it is significantly different than in the center .",
    "given that both methods are arbitrary in choosing the thresholds , we decided to adopt as the length of the bar semi - major axis the mean of the low and high estimates , that is @xmath58 kpc .",
    "we verified that the bar length estimated in this way does not change significantly over the period ( between the first and second pericenter ) we have selected for our study of orbits .",
    "we also note that the bar length is always shorter than the tidal radius at the corresponding time as calculated in @xcite .",
    "we use an algorithm similar to the numerical analysis of fundamental frequencies ( naff ) , developed by @xcite and discussed extensively by e.g. @xcite . in the computations we use @xmath59 simulation outputs from the period when the bar rotates steadily and proceed as follows .    to study the orbits",
    ", we have to find the peaks of the fourier transform ( ft ) of a time series of a given coordinate , e.g.  y(t ) .",
    "the ft @xmath60 has the following form : @xmath61 \\mathrm{d}t\\right|,\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is a frequency , and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the beginning and the end of the period of interest . because @xmath65 originates from a simulation , we have it in a sampled form as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in our case @xmath69 and @xmath70 gyr .",
    "hence , we have to approximate the integral as the sum : @xmath71 let us note that we do not use any window function ( as e.g. @xcite ) , because it widens the peaks .",
    "they are already quite wide due to the small value of @xmath0 and broadening them further would result in overlapping of the peaks in some spectra .",
    "@xmath60 is a function of a continuous variable @xmath62 and initially we have no knowledge of its shape .",
    "hence , we calculate its values for a discrete set of frequencies @xmath72 , which are equidistant with @xmath73 gyr@xmath74 .",
    "we note that this spacing is a few times denser than in the case of the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm .",
    "we use a denser sampling since the one in the fft is of the order of the width of an individual peak and we found it insufficient .    to find the maximum , we search for a maximal value of @xmath75 and we denote its location by @xmath76 .",
    "the frequency @xmath76 is only an approximate location of the peak .",
    "hence , following the brent algorithm @xcite , we search for the true maximum of the @xmath60 function in an interval @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a small integer .",
    "we denote the obtained maximum of @xmath79 by @xmath80 .",
    "however , the initial search for the maximum using @xmath75 poses a risk .",
    "let us imagine that the spectrum was composed of two peaks : one exactly at @xmath76 and the other , slightly higher , at @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "when calculating the sampled spectrum , @xmath83 of the first peak would be picked exactly , but the second one would be probed only as @xmath84 and @xmath85 , both smaller than @xmath86 . hence , its height would be underestimated and the first peak , smaller in reality , would be used for the refined search with the brent algorithm .    to overcome this problem ,",
    "we subtract a sine wave corresponding to the previously found @xmath80 from the initial time series @xmath65 , obtaining a transformed time series @xmath87 .",
    "then , we search for the maximum of ft of @xmath87 , using the same method as described above , and denote the position of the maximum as @xmath88 .",
    "next , we search for the peak around @xmath88 in the ft of the _ initial time series @xmath65_. we compare the amplitudes ( calculated from ft of @xmath65 ) of the two peaks at @xmath80 and @xmath88 and we denote the frequency of the higher one as @xmath89 .",
    "an example of the time series @xmath90 and its fourier spectrum is shown in figure [ fig_freq_anal ] .",
    "in addition to the highest peak , other significant lines are present in the spectrum . in particular , in the case of the @xmath42 spectrum , the second highest peak usually has the same frequency as @xmath91 .    , for one of the stellar particles .",
    "bottom : the corresponding fourier spectrum of @xmath65 .",
    "the frequency @xmath89 is indicated with a dashed line .",
    "the second highest peak corresponds to @xmath91 . ]",
    "the smaller peaks in the spectrum are also important and we retrieve the three most pronounced lines from each spectrum .",
    "we subtract the mode with the estimated frequency @xmath89 from the initial time series and repeat the procedure looking for next frequencies .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure is still not unambiguous . due to the subtraction of the first peak",
    ", the second one may grow and in some rare cases become larger than the supposed highest one .",
    "thus , in the end we sort the lines .",
    "these issues point out to a major problem : if there are many lines in the spectrum , deciding which one is dominant may be very difficult in some cases .",
    "the width of a peak in the spectrum can be approximated as @xmath92 , where @xmath45 is the total time over which the fourier transform is calculated . in our case @xmath93",
    "first , this means that higher frequencies are determined relatively more accurately than lower ones .",
    "second , if @xmath94 gyr@xmath74 and @xmath95 gyr@xmath74 , these two frequencies are barely resolved in the @xmath42 spectrum .",
    "therefore , for very low @xmath89 its determination becomes impossible .",
    "moreover , at such low frequencies the particles complete too few orbits , which influences the relative height of the peaks .",
    "usually , the @xmath96 ) projection of orbits in bars is studied in terms of a ratio @xmath97 , where @xmath14 is the angular frequency , @xmath13 is the epicyclic frequency and @xmath7 is the pattern speed .",
    "these frequencies are calculated in a cylindrical reference frame , centered on the galaxy center , hence we will refer to them as cylindrical frequencies . here , however , we chose to work in terms of the frequencies of the oscillations along the @xmath41 and @xmath42 axes of a coordinate system rotating with the bar , which we will refer to as cartesian frequencies .",
    "there are several reasons for our choice .",
    "given the shape of the bar , this choice may seem more natural .",
    "we also wish to identify the various frequencies and families in the same way as in triaxial ellipsoids , i.e. distinguish boxes from tubes ( long- , or short - axis ) and not specifically in terms of the periodic orbit approach typically used for disk galaxies @xcite .",
    "we also do not wish to make comparisons with specific theoretical work ( e.g. to calculate angular momentum redistribution within the galaxy ) , nor are we interested in the corotation resonance ( i.e. the resonance in which @xmath98 ) , which in fact is well outside the region we can study here .",
    "last but not least , the cartesian frequencies are more straightforward to calculate than the cylindrical ones .",
    "more specifically , it is the angular frequency @xmath14 that is much more complex to calculate and in many cases a straightforward application of a fourier transform may lead to erroneous results and should be supplemented with further techniques ( @xcite and in prep . ;",
    "@xcite ) . discussing this is beyond the limits of this study and will be the subject of a separate paper .",
    ", i.e. those not supporting the bar . the majority of the particles exhibit a correlation between @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "]    notwithstanding these issues , we made some experiments with the cylindrical frequencies in order to be able to compare to previous results .",
    "for @xmath14 calculated in a simplified way , namely from the fourier transform of the particle position angle @xmath101 , we obtained that about @xmath102 particles analyzed had @xmath103 .",
    "these orbits have @xmath104 and @xmath105 , which is easy to understand and gives the @xmath106 ratio .",
    "moreover , we found a considerable number of particles having @xmath107 ( for a possibly similar group , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "an inspection of their shapes revealed that they are usually not quite elongated with the bar .",
    "they have more square shapes or are even perpendicular to the bar .",
    "it turns out that the highest peak in their fourier spectrum of @xmath108 no longer has @xmath109 , but rather @xmath110 .",
    "therefore , one can expect @xmath111 . to illustrate this , we chose a subset of particles having @xmath112 and plotted their frequency ratios in figure [ fig_group_ab ] .",
    "it turns out that most of the particles follow this relation .",
    "we thus perform our frequency analysis using @xmath91 , @xmath89 and @xmath113 , as well as @xmath13 .",
    "we also retrieve the amplitudes of the fourier peaks and denote them by @xmath114 , @xmath115 etc . some caution concerning",
    "the accuracy of our frequency determination is in order .",
    "usually , tens of orbital periods are considered to be required to reliably determine the frequencies . here , we trace the orbits for less than a dozen periods , so we performed two tests of accuracy for the particles having a mean distance from the potential center of @xmath38 kpc .",
    "first , we generated mock time series of @xmath41 and @xmath42 coordinates .",
    "the time series were sums of three sine waves of amplitudes obtained for real particles , but their phases were randomized .",
    "then we used our method to recover the frequency ratios . for the x@xmath1 orbits the dispersion was of the order of @xmath116 . for the box orbits , it was larger and up to @xmath117 .",
    "it turned out that the main contribution to the error comes from the presence of more than one peak in the fourier spectrum .",
    "thus this test may be considered simplified since we did not take into account e.g. harmonics .",
    "second , as x@xmath1 orbits are expected to have the frequency ratio of @xmath118 , we checked how accurately we recover this value for the orbits from the simulation .",
    "we found the dispersion to be around @xmath119 , slightly larger than in the experiments with the mock data .",
    "hence , we estimate that the overall accuracy of our frequency ratios is of the order of @xmath120 . unfortunately",
    ", in some cases an orbit has two peaks of similar amplitude in the spectrum .",
    "additionally , if such an orbit is integrated for too short a time , then the relative height of the peaks will be changed . as a result ,",
    "a misidentification of the highest frequency is possible . to estimate",
    "how often this occurs , we would have to study subdominant frequencies and numerical noise , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in this section we discuss the most common shapes of particle orbits and their characteristic frequency ratios .",
    "first we consider face - on views of the orbits , then we proceed to ( a)ban shapes in the edge - on view . finally , we show the orbits found in the very center of the bar .     kpc . ]    in figure [ fig_orbits_flat ] we present various shapes of orbits in the plane of the disk , arranged according to the growing @xmath100 ratio . in each row",
    "there are three projections of the orbits : face - on , edge - on and end - on .",

    "row ( a ) of the figure shows an x@xmath1 orbit , which has @xmath121 .",
    "we also found versions of this orbit with two loops at both ends , but then such orbits may have @xmath122 , depending on the size of the loops .",
    "some have only one well developed loop and in those cases @xmath123 . when viewed edge - on , they are usually flat .",
    "in row ( b ) we depicted an orbit perpendicular to the bar for most of the time , i.e. @xmath124 .",
    "such orbits often have a loop along the @xmath41-axis and are vertically extended , but not necessarily .",
    "they can be found approximately in a range @xmath125 and may be related to the classical families x@xmath10 or x@xmath11 .    in row ( c )",

    "they have the same shapes as the orbits in triaxial potentials , described by @xcite .",
    "rows ( a ) and ( b ) of the figure show long - axis tube orbits , i.e. revolving around the longest axis of the bar .",
    "the one in row ( a ) is the inner long - axis tube , distinguished by its extension along the @xmath41 axis .",
    "the outer long - axis tube in row ( b ) is thinner in the @xmath41 direction .",
    "it is worth noticing that they are not symmetric in the @xmath134 view due to the coriolis force .",
    "such a behavior was also noticed in the case of orbits in a rotating triaxial potential @xcite . in row ( c )",
    "we present a short - axis tube which revolves around the shortest axis of the bar .",
    "we note that all orbits of this kind are retrograde , thus in the @xmath135 plane they rotate in the opposite direction to the bar itself . in rotating triaxial potentials",
    "the retrograde short - axis tubes also replace the prograde ones @xcite .",
    "orbits of shapes similar to the ones in the triaxial potential are present only in the very center of the bar , presumably because the potential there resembles the one of the rotating ellipsoid .",
    "we divided the particles according to their mean distance from the center of the dwarf , @xmath136 .",
    "centers of the bins span the range from @xmath137 kpc to @xmath138 kpc and have equal widths of @xmath139 kpc .",
    "the position of the bin with the smallest @xmath136 was set by the resolution of the simulation , whereas the largest @xmath136 was chosen so as to ensure a reliable frequency identification of close peaks in the @xmath42 spectrum , as we already discussed . in each bin we measured the frequencies for @xmath140 particles .",
    "we note that the mean distance of a given particle from the bar center may be significantly smaller than its maximum extent , especially along the bar major axis .",
    "particles in the @xmath137 kpc bin may well reach @xmath141 kpc .",
    "the orbits with @xmath132 kpc extend to about @xmath142 kpc in the @xmath41 direction , as can be confirmed by referring to figure [ fig_orbits_flat ] .",
    "the orbits with @xmath138 reach approximately @xmath143 kpc .",
    "we estimated the bar length to be approximately @xmath58 kpc , hence in our analysis we fully cover the inner 1/2 of the bar and have strong indications for up to 2/3 .",
    "similar fraction of the bar content was covered in terms of particle numbers .",
    "there are about @xmath144 particles with @xmath145 kpc , i.e. closer to the center than the innermost bin . in the region we analyzed ,",

    "hence , we studied the particles comprising about @xmath150 of the stellar mass contained in the bar .    .",
    "the three panels , from top to bottom , show results for bins of @xmath137 , @xmath38 , @xmath151 kpc , respectively . ]    in figure [ fig_histogram_yx ] we plot histograms of the ratio @xmath100 for three bins of @xmath136 .",
    "the peak around @xmath121 corresponds mostly to x@xmath1-type orbits , but includes also short - axis tubes in the innermost bin .",
    "the height of the peak grows with the mean radius , which means that the fraction of the x@xmath1 orbits grows as well .",
    "the increase of the width of the peak is related to our method of retrieving frequencies , which is more accurate in the center of the dwarf .",
    "the wide distribution of frequencies in the range @xmath36-@xmath152 changes significantly with radius .",
    "as can be judged from figure [ fig_orbits_flat ] , the orbits with larger @xmath100 are horizontally thinner in the face - one view .",
    "thus , the orbits further from the center of the bar are on average more elongated than the ones in the center .    in the innermost bin , besides the x@xmath1 peak at @xmath118 , there are two noticeable components : one around @xmath153 and the other , very broad , at @xmath154 .",
    "thus , the particles in the center are not on very elongated orbits , but their orbits are more square - like .",
    "the distribution at @xmath132 kpc resembles most the overall distribution of the particle orbits discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the most represented orbits are the 5/3 ones .",

    "the peak around @xmath156 consists of orbits similar to the one in figure [ fig_orbits_flat ] ( c ) , which has two comparable peaks at @xmath157 and @xmath158 in the @xmath42 spectrum .",
    "the other group of particles , at @xmath159 , is mostly made of orbits perpendicular the bar ( akin to figure [ fig_orbits_flat ] ( b ) ) , but we can not exclude the possibility that some of them actually belong to the disk population .    .",

    "most of the orbits are vertically extended . in the intermediate bin more than half of the particles",
    "are on rather flat orbits , but there is also a large fraction of thick orbits .",
    "there is also a pronounced peak at @xmath163 , consisting of ( a)ban orbits . in the outermost bin",
    "there are fewer thick orbits and the ( a)ban peak is barely visible .",

    "the small peak at @xmath168 in the innermost bin consists of the long - axis tube orbits ( see figure  [ fig_orbits_ell ] ) .",
    "the orbits around @xmath169 0.4 - 0.5 are orbits with @xmath170 ( e.g. x@xmath1 ) that are flat ( i.e. @xmath171 ) .",

    "we divide the particle orbits into families , differing in their shapes and contributions to the density distribution .",
    "we identified five types of orbits : box , x@xmath1 , not supporting the bar , long - axis tubes and short - axis tubes .",
    "below we describe the criteria employed in this classification .    the largest fraction of _",
    "x@xmath1 orbits _ are simple loop orbits ( figure  [ fig_orbits_flat]a ) , with @xmath173 .",
    "however , as predicted by theoretical studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some x@xmath1 orbits have small loops at their ends . if the loops are large enough , a different frequency dominates the @xmath42 spectrum , therefore we also add to this category particles with @xmath174 .",
    "unfortunately , in many cases only one loop is well developed , so in order to classify these orbits we need to add more elaborate criteria : @xmath175 and the second and the third frequency in the @xmath42 spectrum being equal to either @xmath91 or @xmath176 .",
    "the x@xmath1 orbits in our simulation are very elongated , so we also put a constraint on the amplitude ratio : @xmath177 .",
    "the family of _ orbits not supporting the bar _ contains particles admitting @xmath178 , which usually have shapes similar to the ones in figure  [ fig_orbits_flat ] ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "we additionally include here orbits that are elongated in the direction perpendicular to the bar ( i.e. @xmath124 ) and not classified as tube orbits .",
    "moreover , orbits having @xmath179 and not assigned elsewhere were also assigned to this group .",
    "the family of _ long - axis tube orbits _ is populated with particles revolving around the @xmath41-axis , i.e. the long axis of the bar , which are depicted in figure  [ fig_orbits_ell ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this condition is realized by setting @xmath180 .",
    "we are not able to differentiate between the inner and outer subtypes , partially due to the asymmetry in the edge - on view .",
    "particles on _ short - axis tube orbits _ revolve around @xmath43-axis , i.e. the shortest axis of the bar .",
    "thus , they are characterized by @xmath181 , a condition almost the same as for x@xmath1 orbits .",
    "however , they are perpendicular to the bar , so we impose @xmath124 .",
    "additionally , after inspecting their frequency ratios in the plane of the disk , we added another constraint @xmath182 .",
    "all of the remaining orbits were classified as _ box orbits_. due to the exhaustive constraints adopted for previous families , only orbits depicted in figure  [ fig_orbits_flat ] ( d)-(g ) , belong to this family .",
    "( blue ) , not supporting the bar ( green ) , long - axis tubes ( purple ) and short - axis tubes ( orange ) .",

    "particles belonging to each orbit family are marked with different colors . in order to avoid overcrowding",

    "first of all , it can be immediately noticed that the tube orbits ( purple and orange ) are present in large numbers only in the innermost bin and there are only very few of them in the outer bins .",
    "the x@xmath1 orbits ( blue ) are well represented in all bins , but they become more frequent as the radius grows .",
    "their vertical thickness is also correlated with the distance from the center . in the outer parts they are flatter than in the inner parts , as indicated by their @xmath160 . a part of x@xmath1 orbits distribution overlaps with the vertical @xmath183 line at all radii , indicating that x@xmath1v@xmath1 ( ban ) and x@xmath1v@xmath10 ( aban ) orbits exist throughout the whole bar .",
    "even some clustering of the dots at this resonance can be seen in the intermediate bin . in the innermost bin ,",
    "the x@xmath1 orbits are clearly separated from the short - axis tube orbits .",
    "the width of the population with respect to the @xmath118 line is related to the uncertainty of the frequency determination .",
    "as already discussed , our method is more accurate in the inner part than in the outer part of the bar .",
    "the orbits which do not support the bar ( green ) are located at @xmath190 .",
    "such a frequency ratio is not surprising , as those orbits are not as elongated as the bar .",
    "moreover , they are vertically thick , as indicated by @xmath191 . in the outermost bin ,",
    "the huge spread of these orbits is probably due to the misidentification of the frequency with the largest amplitude in the @xmath42 spectrum ( the time period considered was too short in comparison with the orbital period ) . on the other hand , those might also be particles belonging to the disk population .",
    "the box orbits ( red ) constitute the majority of the stellar particle orbits in the bar .",
    "the area they occupy has very well defined boundaries , especially in the innermost bin . in the outer ones ,",
    "the boundaries are blurred due to the reduced accuracy . the cloud of points representing the box orbits changes its position with radius . in the outer parts they have , on average , smaller @xmath165 and @xmath160 than in the inner parts .",
    "it means that in the outer parts they are thinner and flatter .",
    "in all bins , some of the box orbits are located on the @xmath183 line , so they exhibit ( a)ban shapes .",
    "depending on the distance from the center , orbits with all possible @xmath100 ratios may be in this vertical resonance , especially in the range @xmath192 .",
    "examples of these orbits were presented in figure  [ fig_orbits_ban ] ( c)-(f ) . in the intermediate bin ,",
    "even some clustering of points close to the @xmath183 line is visible .    :",
    "box orbits in red , x@xmath1 in blue , not supporting the bar in green , long - axis tubes in purple and short - axis tubes in orange . ]    in figure [ fig_classification_radial ] we show how the contribution of different orbit families varies with the distance from the bar center .",
    "as already pointed out , the box orbits are the most prevalent .",
    "their contribution varies between @xmath193 and @xmath102 of all the orbits and shows only a small decrease with the distance from the center .",
    "the x@xmath1 orbits are quite uncommon at the center ( less than @xmath194 ) , but their fraction grows with radius , up to @xmath195 at @xmath138 kpc . the contribution of orbits not supporting the bar is about @xmath196 and slowly decreases with radius .",
    "the orbits known to exist in triaxial potentials ( short- and long - axis tubes ) make up a few percent of the distribution and practically disappear beyond @xmath132 kpc .    in order to obtain the total contributions of the different families ,",
    "we need to weigh the results from figure  [ fig_classification_radial ] by the total number of particles present in a given bin . as a result",
    ", we obtain the following percentages : box orbits : @xmath197 , x@xmath1 orbits : @xmath198 , orbits not supporting the bar : @xmath199 , long - axis tubes : @xmath200 and finally short - axis tubes : @xmath201 ( percentages do not add up to @xmath9 because of rounding ) .",
    "it is difficult to give an estimate of the error bars for these fractions , particularly because the criteria we applied ( e.g. for the frequency or amplitude ratios ) can only be given approximately , and because the box orbits category is composed of all orbits that do not belong to any of the other categories we have defined . moreover , all the chaotic orbits are also included in the box category",

    "before @xmath206 gyr the particle was oscillating around @xmath207 with a small amplitude .",
    "after @xmath203 gyr the amplitude grew significantly and in addition the oscillation became asymmetric with respect to the @xmath207 plane .",

    "here we found that the abundance of x@xmath1 orbits grows at least up to two - thirds of the bar length and presumably also further away . in the innermost part of the bar @xcite also found orbits known from triaxial potentials .",
    "the frequency map of @xcite also looks qualitatively similar to the ones shown in our figure  [ fig_frequency_maps ] and the dependence of the position of the cloud containing the box orbits on the distance from the center / jacobi constant is also reproduced .",
    "the main difference between our results is the absence of the diffuse cloud of particles around @xmath118 .",
    "we believe that it might be the fault of our method which is not able to properly assign @xmath89 frequencies to some orbits which are not elongated with the bar or may also belong to the disk population or be chaotic ( as those were not included in the frequency map in @xcite ) .    @xcite treat the @xmath225 orbits , shown in our figure  [ fig_orbits_flat ] ( d ) and ( e ) , differently from the other boxes .",
    "however , in our simulation we did not find any significant clustering around this particular resonance .",
    "moreover , we have found more periodic box - like orbits : 4/3 shown in figure  [ fig_orbits_flat ] ( c ) and 5/3 shown in figure  [ fig_orbits_flat ] ( f ) .",
    "our study certainly has limitations , but it appears that the orbital structures of the tidally induced bars and the bars formed in isolation are qualitatively similar to each other .",
    "we have found a few differences , however to understand and explain them , a deeper study would be needed .",
    "another powerful tool , useful in studying the orbital structure , is the surface of section ( sos ) .",

    "if a particle is on a periodic orbit or is trapped around one , its subsequent positions on sos ( called consequents ) lie at the same point or form eventually a continuous curve .",
    "moreover , orbits trapped around different periodic orbits occupy a different part of the sos . on the other hand ,",
    "if the particle is on a chaotic orbit , its consequents are scattered randomly .",
    "of course , sos does not tell the full story : the existence of a given orbit in phase space does not mean that in reality or in a simulation this orbit would be populated by any objects . here , we did not use sos , however we would like to put our results in the context of previous studies .",

    "it seems that the fish version of the 3/2 orbit would occupy the same spots in the sos , hence it is appropriate to treat those orbits as one type .",
    "the @xcite tr1 orbit corresponds to our 5/3 orbit from figure  [ fig_orbits_flat ] ( f ) .",
    "both these families occupy small stability islands in the sos in the vicinity of the x@xmath1 stability curves .",
    "it corresponds to the fact that in our simulation the exact resonance did not attract many particles .",
    "both families are claimed to be bifurcations of the x@xmath1 family .",
    "a bar formed in an @xmath0-body simulation , analyzed by @xcite , also exhibits complex structure of phase space . in his case the four islands corresponding to 3/2 orbits are much larger and the region trapped around x@xmath1 orbits is significantly smaller . in line with our results , the 3/2 orbits are present at lower values of jacobi constant ( i.e. closer to the center ) than the three islands of 5/3 orbits .",
    "@xcite studied the behavior of particles perturbed from the periodic 3/2 islands , which lie amidst the chaotic sea .",
    "the orbits turned out to be chaotic , however they were sticky to the x@xmath1 region , as their consequents remain in the vicinity of x@xmath1 region for a few hundred of the x@xmath1 periods .",
    "@xcite also found that the 3/2 orbits form a ring or chain of islands in the sos .",
    "hence , they may be considered as viable building blocks of the density distribution .",
    "unfortunately , @xcite did not extensively study the 5/3 family , which seems to be more abundant in our model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it would be interesting to check if their perturbed versions are also sticky in phase space .",

    "@xcite supposed that 3/2 orbits , when seen edge - on , may contribute to the b / p shape .",
    "it turned out that in the relevant sos the 3/2 orbits are sticky to the x@xmath1v@xmath1 stability islands . in our pre - buckling bar we found many 3/2 orbits with a ban shape .",
    "however , the orbits which we caught buckling , have either x@xmath1 or elongated boxy shapes . nonetheless , during the proper buckling period also the 3/2 and other orbits may buckle . on the other hand , @xcite claim that _ brezel _ orbits contribute the most to b / p bulges . in our notation",
    "they have @xmath227 and the particular example of this orbit shown in @xcite is a distorted version of @xmath225 pretzel orbit .    it may be considered surprising that we find in our simulations orbits trapped around the x@xmath1v@xmath10 periodic orbit ( figure  [ fig_orbits_ban]b ) , as @xcite found this family to be unstable .",
    "indeed , we found significantly fewer infinity - symbol shaped x@xmath1v@xmath10 orbits than banana shaped x@xmath1v@xmath1 orbits , and this may be related to instability .",
    "moreover , the particles we found trapped on x@xmath1v@xmath10 orbits change their sense of circulation on the @xmath228 symbol .",
    "there are thus two possible explanations of the existence of orbits trapped around the x@xmath1v@xmath10 family",
    ". they could be non - periodic sticky orbits in the neighborhood of x@xmath1v@xmath10 , as discussed by @xcite , albeit in the different context .",
    "alternatively , the x@xmath1v@xmath10 orbits may be more stable in simulation potentials which are more realistic than the ferrer s bar potentials ( for a discussion of the inadequacies of the latter , see @xcite and @xcite ) . in general , when studying the vertical @xmath106 resonance one should take into account the whole ban - aban sequence @xcite .",
    "we have studied the orbital structure of a tidally induced bar formed in a dwarf galaxy orbiting around a milky way - like host .",
    "we have analyzed the dominant frequencies during the period between the first and the second pericenter passage , when the bar is strongest , rotates steadily and has not yet buckled .",
    "since we studied the real stellar orbits in the simulation and not in a frozen potential , our analysis is limited to the inner two - thirds of the bar .",
    "our results should be relevant for at least some of dwarf galaxies in the local group , for which there are indications of the presence of a bar @xcite .    for several reasons , described in detail in this paper , we decided not to use the cylindrical frequencies , but to use the cartesian ones instead .",
    "an important one amongst these reasons is that calculating @xmath14 properly is a complex task , which is beyond the scope of this paper and will be explored in another work .",
    "we have found a variety of particle orbits , including obviously the x@xmath1 orbits with @xmath118 . however , many of the stellar orbits turned out to have boxy shapes with various degree of elongation .",
    "in addition , we found boxy periodic orbits with @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "the boxy orbits can be either flat or not , and they can be in the vertical @xmath183 resonance , exhibiting banana or infinity - symbol shapes in the edge - on view . in the very center of the bar we encountered the orbits known from triaxial potentials : long - axis tubes ( inner and outer ) and short - axis tubes ( only retrograde ) .",
    "the distribution of the box orbit shapes depends on the distance from the center of the bar .",
    "the box orbits in the inner parts are on average less elongated than in the outer parts .",
    "also the thickness of the orbits changes with radius . in the center",
    "they are mostly vertically extended , but they are thinner further away . the ( a)ban orbits are present at all radii , but their abundance varies .",
    "the differences in the orbital shapes are probably related to the changes of the potential in the bar .",
    "although the variation of the axis ratio with radius is small ( figure  [ fig_shape_x ] ) , it seems to have sufficient impact on the orbits . in",
    "the frequency maps the box orbits are grouped in clouds , whose position changes with the distance from the center .    using the frequency ratios and other criteria we have divided the orbits into five groups : boxes , classical x@xmath1 , orbits not supporting the bar , long - axis tubes and short - axis tubes .",
    "the tubes are present only in the center , where the potential is most similar to the rotating triaxial ellipsoid .",
    "the fraction of x@xmath1 orbits grows from @xmath231 in the center to @xmath223 in the outermost bin we considered here which is between half and 2/3 of the bar length .",
    "however , in total we found only @xmath232 of classical x@xmath1 orbits .",
    "the most common ( @xmath8 ) orbits in our tidally induced bar are boxes .",
    "hints concerning that can be already found in @xcite . in their simulated bar @xmath233 of particles were on orbits with an alternating direction of rotation .",
    "the full distribution of the @xmath165 ratio is peaked around the 5/3 periodic orbits , which have a similar shape in the face - on view to the bar @xmath44 axis ratio .",
    "we can not compare our results directly to most of the previous ones , which used cylindrical frequencies .",
    "however , our results are in broad agreement with the findings of @xcite , obtained for a bar formed in an isolated milky way - like galaxy .",
    "hence , it seems that despite the different formation mechanism , the orbital structures are similar .",
    "even though we studied the bar before its main buckling event , we have found some orbits which buckle upward in the outer part of the bar .",
    "it is worth noting that the main buckling event is most pronounced in the downward direction and here we probably encountered the beginning of this process .",
    "the buckling orbits are either of the x@xmath1 type or very elongated boxes .",
    "our method of searching for particles with exceptionally small values of @xmath113 seems to be a promising tool for studying how orbits actually evolve during the buckling instability .",
    "boxy orbits seem to be an indispensable element of the density distribution in any barred galaxy .",
    "therefore , more work is needed regarding the parent , periodic orbits .",
    "when perturbed , they become chaotic but remain in the vicinity of the stability islands , i.e. they are sticky .",
    "the distribution of frequency ratios of the box orbits and their shapes may be influenced by the presence of various stability islands in phase space .",
    "therefore , comprehensive studies of phase space of not artificial , but realistic barred potentials would be very insightful .",
