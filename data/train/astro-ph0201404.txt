    "the usual approach to derive the kinematics ( mean velocity along the line of sight , the velocity dispersion ,  ) of galaxies from observed spectra is comparing them to the spectra of so - called template stars . the broadening of the absorption lines in the galaxy spectra is then interpreted as a result of the orbital motion of the myriad of stars along the line of sight through the galaxy  : each star has a doppler shifted spectrum and the absorption lines consequently appear at slightly different wavelengths .",
    "these template stars are carefully selected  : they should not rotate too rapidly , not be member of a binary system or be peculiar in any other way so as to be a good representation of the average stellar population .",
    "thus , the broadening of the absorption lines is explained completely in terms of stellar orbital motions .",
    "however , a large fraction of the stars in a galaxy are members of a binary ( or even multiple ) system .",
    "stars in binary systems orbit the center of mass of the two stars and this extra velocity adds to the velocity dispersion of the galaxy . hence , the measured kinematics of galaxies are not independent of the population of binary stars .",
    "previous authors have used monte carlo simulations to estimate the influence of binaries on the observed velocity dispersion ( see hargreaves _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this work focused mainly on observations of dwarf galaxies in the local group or globular clusters that can be resolved into individual stars . for a sample of stars in a galaxy ,",
    "radial velocities are measured and from these velocities , the mean velocity and velocity dispersion profiles can be established .",
    "the monte carlo calculations by construction are very suited to interpret these `` discrete '' data , e.g. it is possible to check the effect of repeated observations to weed out short - period binaries .",
    "the crowded inner regions of globulars or dwarf galaxies outside of the local group however are impervious to this kind of study . there , integrated - light spectra are needed to measure the kinematics .",
    "as bigger telescopes make it possible to penetrate to ever lower levels of surface brightness and hence to study low - mass stellar systems at large distances , it is important to investigate the effect of binary stars on the derived losvd .",
    "since monte carlo calculations at present are unable to yield the full losvd or even higher order moments such as the kurtosis without excessive computational effort , they can not be employed in this context .",
    "hence , we give analytical expressions for the velocity moments of the binary stars and for the losvd itself ( approximating all binaries to consist of stars on circular orbits ) .",
    "we first give a number of definitions of important quantities and clarify some notations .",
    "we focus our attention on a single binary system .",
    "one star , the `` primary '' , has a mass @xmath2 and the other , the `` secondary '' has a mass @xmath3 .",
    "all orbital parameters pertain to the primary s orbit  :    * @xmath4 : the velocity of the primary with respect to the binary s center of mass , projected onto the observer s line of sight * @xmath5 : the gravitational constant of force for the primary s orbit around the center of mass .",
    "if @xmath6 is the force constant of the orbit relative to the secondary , then @xmath7 * @xmath8 : semi - major axis of the primary s orbit with respect to the binary s center of mass . if @xmath9 is the semi - major axis of the primary s orbit with respect to the secondary , then @xmath10 * @xmath11 : respectively the period , eccentricity , inclination , argument of periastron and longitude of ascending node of the primary s orbit . the latter does not affect the primary s position projected onto the line of sight nor its line - of - sight velocity and hence does not enter the calculations .",
    "* @xmath12 : the true anomaly along the primary s orbit .",
    "the specific binary losvd gives the probability of finding the primary star with mass @xmath2 with a line - of - sight velocity in the interval @xmath13 $ ] , given that it revolves around a secondary star with mass @xmath3 on an elliptical orbit with orbital parameters @xmath9 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "intuitively , this probability is proportional to the fraction of its period during which the primary has a velocity in this interval .",
    "mathematically , this translates into the following expression for the specific binary losvd  : @xmath17 with @xmath4 the line - of - sight velocity of the primary at phase angle @xmath12 on its orbit @xmath18 here , @xmath19 hence , if follows that @xmath20 and consequently @xmath21 the specific binary losvd is a function solely of @xmath4 . to eliminate the phase angle @xmath12 from this expression , equation ( [ velo ] )",
    "must be inverted  : @xmath22 depending on the sign of @xmath23 , there are two solutions , @xmath24 and @xmath25  : @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that a star on an elliptical orbit will obtain the projected velocity @xmath4 twice during each revolution .",
    "the losvd is then just the sum of @xmath24 and @xmath25  : @xmath28 in the case of a circular orbit ",
    "i.e. @xmath29  this reduces to the simple expression @xmath30 the losvd of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "the specific binary losvd is presented for various values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 in figure [ phi_intr ] .",
    "the losvd is high around the extreme velocities where @xmath31 ( i.e. around @xmath32 ) and around the apocenter velocity @xmath33 , a direct corollary of kepler s second law .",
    "the @xmath34 velocity moment of the specific binary losvd is defined as @xmath35 all powers in the integrand can be expanded , yielding @xmath36 for the integral to be non - zero , one condition is that @xmath37 with @xmath38 an integer .",
    "the other condition is that @xmath39 must be even .",

    "this condition can only be satisfied for even moments and if @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus , if we substitute @xmath50 for @xmath51 , and make use of the fact that @xmath52 then ( [ mome ] ) reduces to @xmath53 with @xmath54 euler s beta function .",

    "the specific binary losvd ( [ intrine ] ) must be averaged over all orbital parameters .",
    "as the calculations for the general case are quite cumbersome , we only calculated the binary losvd in the approximation that the members of all binaries revolve on circular orbits .",
    "this is clearly not a very realistic assumption but it is instructive to have at least this first approximation of the losvd . to obtain the binary losvd",
    ", the specific binary losvd ( [ intrine0 ] ) must be averaged over all possible values of the inclination @xmath16 , the orbital radius @xmath8 and the secondary mass @xmath3 . to do this",
    ", we have to assume distributions for each of these parameters .",
    "the orbital planes of all binaries can be expected to be distributed randomly .",
    "each direction of the normal of the orbital plane is then equally plausible . using the notations of figure [ orbitps ] , an elementary solid angle around the orbital plane s normal",
    "is given by @xmath56 .",
    "since the direction @xmath57 is uniformly distributed @xmath58 one obtains @xmath59 \\label{disi}\\ ] ] as the distribution of the inclination . in soederhjelm @xcite , the orbital parameters and masses of about 200 nearby visual binaries are given .",
    "the data are obtained from hipparcos and ground - based telescopes .",
    "figure [ soei ] shows the distribution of the inclination , extracted from this catalog , and clearly demonstrates the validity of ( [ disi ] ) .",
    "the distribution of the semi - major axis can not readily be extracted from a catalog .",
    "catalogs of visual binaries usually only contain the semi - major axis expressed in arcseconds since their distances are not known .",
    "catalogs of spectroscopic binaries do give the semi - major axis expressed in e.g. au but they tend to be strongly biased towards very tight binaries since these will have the highest orbital velocities and hence the largest and the easiest measurable doppler - shifts .",
    "however , it is natural to assume that more tightly bound binaries are less easily disrupted by external influences .",
    "hence , one would expect to observe less binaries with lower binding energies .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath60 as the distribution of @xmath9 ( the orbital radius with respect to the secondary ) . here , @xmath61 is the binary s binding energy and @xmath62 is a real number .",
    "the closest gravitational few - body system at hand , our planetary system , obeys ( [ disa ] ) quite well with @xmath63 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds for @xmath9 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively , can be estimated as follows . for a binary to be stable",
    ", the mutual gravitational attraction between its members should overcome the tidal forces exerted by the host galaxy .",
    "in other words , if we denote the average mass of a star by @xmath66  : @xmath67 with @xmath38 the distance of the binary to the galaxy s center and @xmath68 the total mass inside a sphere with radius @xmath38 .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the maximum orbital radius  : @xmath69{\\frac{3}{8 \\pi \\overline{n}}}\\ ] ] with @xmath70 the average number density of the stars inside the radius @xmath38 .",
    "for reasonable values of @xmath70 , @xmath65 is very large .",
    "for instance , @xmath71 leads to @xmath72 .",
    "binaries can also be disrupted by an encounter with a third star . for typical number densities ,",
    "stars approach each other to about 1500  au once in a hubble time as they orbit in a galaxy s gravitational potential well .",
    "of course , not every such an encounter necessarily breaks up a binary pair .",
    "hence , @xmath73 is at least a couple of thousand au and can be as large as 100,000 au .",
    "our results turn about to be rather insensitive to the value of @xmath65",
    ".    if the members of a binary are very close together , one of them can be in the other s roche lobe and be disrupted by tidal and centrifugal forces .",
    "back - of - the - envelope calculations based on typical masses and radii of k - giants ( with a mass around @xmath74 and a radius of approximately @xmath75)which one is most likely to observe since they are so luminous  give @xmath76 as a fair mean value .",
    "due to ( [ defa ] ) , the distribution of @xmath8 is @xmath77 with @xmath78 and analogously for @xmath79 .    for the distribution of the secondary mass ,",
    "we take the salpeter initial mass function @xmath80 with @xmath81 .",
    "the lower bound for the mass distribution is taken to be @xmath82 , the mass of the most light - weight stars capable of nuclear fusion .",
    "the upper bound @xmath83 is treated as a free parameter of the binary orbital distribution .",
    "realistic values for @xmath83 are around 1.25  m@xmath84 .",
    "this corresponds to stars with a total life - time of 5 - 6  gyr , comparable to the ages of the stellar populations in local group dwarf galaxies ( e.g. smecker - hane _ et al . _",
    "these distributions can be compared to those found by duquennoy  &  mayor @xcite for a sample of 164 solar - type stars in the solar neighborhood . for their sample , they find the following distribution of the binary periods  : @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 is expressed in days ) .",
    "periods were found to lie in the range @xmath89 . using ( [ disa ] ) , ( [ dism ] ) and @xmath90",
    "au ( applicable if binaries are disrupted by tidal forces exerted by the host galaxy ) , we find an approximately uniform distribution of @xmath91 in the range @xmath92 . using @xmath93  au ( applicable if binaries are disrupted by a close encounter with a third star ) , yields an approximately uniform distribution of @xmath91 in the range @xmath94 . as always , the truth lies somewhere in between these two extremes .",
    "the salpeter law adopted here provides a reasonable fit to the mass - ratio distribution although it over - estimates the number of low - mass companions with @xmath95 found by duquennoy  &  mayor .",
    "we start with the integration of the specific binary losvd ( [ intrine0 ] ) over the inclination , making use of the distribution ( [ disi ] ) .",
    "the integration region must be limited to @xmath96 with @xmath97 , to assure that the argument of the square root in the denominator of ( [ intrine0 ] ) is positive .",
    "this , of course , is because , for a given @xmath8 and @xmath5 , some binaries with a large inclination can not reach the velocity @xmath4 and must be excluded from the integration .",
    "the binary losvd after this integration becomes @xmath98    we employ the distribution function ( [ disap ] ) to average formula ( [ l2 ] ) over the semi - major axis .",
    "the integration region is now limited to @xmath99 this ensures the positivity of the binary losvd by excluding all binaries that , for a given @xmath5 , can not reach the velocity @xmath4 .",
    "the binary losvd at this stage of the integrations takes the form @xmath100.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the condition @xmath101 is satisfied if @xmath102 in that case , there is no danger of the integrand becoming negative .",
    "if @xmath103 however , the integration region must be limited to @xmath104 if @xmath105 . clearly , @xmath106 if @xmath107 . the integration over the secondary mass involves three basic integrals .",
    "the first one is @xmath108 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 here , @xmath111 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "the second integral is completely analogous  : @xmath112 the third basic integral is @xmath113 in each of these integrals , the factor @xmath114 can be taken out .",
    "we are then left with the following three building blocks  : @xmath115 the binary losvd , averaged over all orbital parameters , finally takes the following form  : @xmath116 .",
    "\\label{losvd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as can be expected , the losvd goes to zero for @xmath117 or equivalently for @xmath118 the highest line - of - sight velocity any binary can reach . as long as @xmath119 , or equivalently for @xmath120 the losvd is velocity independent .",
    "this is the highest velocity that the slowest binaries , i.e. the ones with the lowest secondary mass and the largest orbital radius , can reach .",
    "usually , @xmath65 is very large and consequently , @xmath121 will be a very small velocity , of the order of a few m / s ( see figure [ losvdps ] ) .    to be exact",
    ", the binary losvd ( [ losvd ] ) still needs to be multiplied with the probability that the primary star is actually observed and then be averaged over the primary mass .",
    "it is this final function that quantifies the extra broadening of the absorption lines due to the binary population .",
    "however , the probability of observing a star of a particular spectral type depends both on its intrinsic brightness and on the number of such stars that are around .",
    "as the brightest stars are also the most scarce ones while the faintest stars are extremely abundant , this probability will be sharply peaked . for old to intermediate stellar populations",
    ", this peak corresponds to early k giants on the tip of the giant branch .",
    "we will therefore not do this last integration and instead use an average value for the primary mass .",
    "most authors use @xmath122 and this is the value we will adopt here .",
    "the binary losvd for elliptic orbits is not analytically tractable , but its velocity moments , which we denote by @xmath123 , are",
    ". we set out with the expression ( [ mome ] ) for the moments of the specific binary losvd and average it over the argument of the periastron @xmath15 , the inclination @xmath16 , the secondary mass @xmath3 , the semi - major axis @xmath8 and the eccentricity @xmath14 . for @xmath16 and @xmath3 , one can use the distributions ( [ disi ] ) and ( [ dism ] ) .",
    "the distribution ( [ disap ] ) for the semi - major axis is also still applicable but care has to be taken with the integration limits  : the bounds for @xmath8 are set by the conditions @xmath124 which makes the integration limits of @xmath8 dependent of @xmath14 .    as can be seen in figure [ soee ]",
    ", the distribution of the eccentricity of a sample of 200 visual binaries can be approximated fairly accurately by @xmath125 with @xmath126 , @xmath127 and maximum eccentricity @xmath128 .",
    "the eccentricity distribution found by duquennoy  &  mayor @xcite shows that tight binaries have more circular orbits than wide ones but , overall , their eccentricity distribution is similar to the one derived by soederhjelm . in the remainder , we consider the parameters @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 to be fixed by the observations .",
    "this distribution reaches a maximum for @xmath132 for the parameter values adopted here .",
    "the uniform distribution @xmath133 , which is the distribution advocated by hargreaves _",
    "_ @xcite and mateo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , is obtained by setting @xmath134 .",
    "the argument of the periastron @xmath15 is obviously distributed randomly between @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , @xmath137    averaging the @xmath34 velocity moment of the specific binary losvd ( [ mome ] ) over @xmath15 involves the integral @xmath138 which can only be non - zero if @xmath51 is even .",
    "we will therefore consider only the even moments and make the transformation @xmath139 in which case @xmath140 the integrations over @xmath16 and @xmath3 are pretty straightforward and one obtains the following expression for the moments @xmath141  : @xmath142    the next step is the integration over the semi - major axis @xmath9 , making use of ( [ disa ] )  : @xmath143.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally , we are left with the integration over all possible values of the eccentricity .",

    "\\label{momavere}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath146 , only the terms with @xmath147 survive .",
    "this is only possible if @xmath48 and @xmath148 and ( [ momavere ] ) reduces to @xmath149 the expression for the moments of the losvd for circular orbits .    in the next paragraph , we discuss how the velocity dispersion of the binary losvd for non - circular orbits depends on the distributions of the different orbital parameters .",
    "another important point that will be addressed is the way the shape of the observed losvd depends on the binary fraction .",
    "as is obvious from figures [ sigaminps ] to [ siggam ] , the binary velocity dispersion , i.e. the second order velocity moment @xmath150 , depends most sensitively on the inner cutoff radius @xmath64 and the exponent @xmath62 in the distribution of the semi - major axis @xmath8 and to a lesser degree on the primary mass @xmath2 and the exponent @xmath151 in the salpeter imf adopted as the distribution of the secondary mass @xmath83 .",
    "as the stars in a binary system are allowed to approach each other more closely  in other words , as @xmath64 is lowered  their orbital velocities rise rapidly , boosting the velocity dispersion of the binary population as a whole to values as high as 10  km / s for @xmath152 , as can be seen in figure [ sigaminps ] . since the bright giant stars that one is most likely to observe have radii of the order of 10  @xmath153 , the velocity dispersion is limited to values below 4  km / s",
    ". the value of the outer cut - off radius , @xmath65 , does not strongly affect the value of the binary dispersion .",
    "higher @xmath73 values mean that more stars orbit on wide and consequently slow orbits , causing the dispersion to be a bit lower . a higher value of @xmath62 causes stars to move on more tightly bound orbits , thus boosting their velocities .",
    "this is clear from figure [ siggam ] .",
    "if @xmath151 , the exponent of the salpeter imf , is made larger , the secondary masses will tend to be lower which also causes the primary s orbital velocity and hence the velocity dispersion of the binary population as a whole to be lower ( see figure [ sigx ] ) .",
    "if @xmath2 is raised , the center of mass will be closer to the primary , causing its orbital velocity to drop slowly , as is observed in figure [ sigm ] .",
    "larger values for @xmath83 will produce heavier secondary stars . a slowly rising velocity dispersion ensues , as can be seen in figure [ sigm2 ] . the same exercise was done with a uniform distribution for the eccentricity .",
    "the outcome was essentially identical  : the binary velocity dispersion differed at most by 0.1  km / s .",
    "hence , our results do not depend critically on the adopted distribution for the eccentricity .",
    "the values for the binary velocity dispersion obtained here are about the same as those obtained by hargreaves _",
    "_ although these authors use gaussian distributions for the ellipticity , secondary mass and period , making it difficult to directly compare the results .",
    "@xcite , employing a monte carlo simulation with a uniformly distributed ellipticity and secondary mass and a power law distribution for the period , find higher velocity dispersions .",
    "however , it is mentioned by hargreaves _",
    "et al . _ and by olszewski _ et al .",
    "_ that the values published by mateo _",
    "are overestimated due to a coding error .",
    "the corrected mateo _",
    "_ values however are in good agreement with the results obtained by other authors and with those presented here .    in the following",
    ", we will adopt the model with @xmath154 as our `` standard '' model .",
    "its velocity dispersion is @xmath155  km / s and its kurtosis amounts to @xmath156 .",
    "the losvd that would actually be observed is the convolution of the binary losvd ( describing the motion of stars in binary systems ) and the intrinsic losvd of the galaxy ( determined by the stars orbital motions through the galaxy ) .",
    "if we denote the intrinsic galaxy losvd by @xmath157 and the binary losvd by @xmath158 , then the observed losvd @xmath159 can be written as @xmath160 with @xmath161 the dirac delta function and @xmath129 the binary fraction , i.e. the fraction of visible ( solar - mass ) giant stars that have a companion . as an indication ,",
    "duquennoy  &  mayor @xcite find @xmath162 for solar - mass stars in the solar neighborhood with the same range of binary periods as adopted here . in figure [ loso ] ,",
    "the observed losvd is plotted for different binary fractions .",
    "the intrinsic losvd is a gaussian with dispersion @xmath163km / s .",
    "the binary losvd is given by ( [ losvd ] ) with @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 ( @xmath71 ) , @xmath167 and @xmath81 .",
    "the secondary mass is averaged over the interval @xmath168 .",
    "the losvd becomes clearly more peaked and develops broader high - velocity wings as the binary fraction increases .",
    "a comprehensive way of assessing the change in the shape of the observed losvd as a function of the binary fraction is to study its moments .",
    "if the intrinsic galaxy losvd is a symmetric function of the line - of - sight velocity , then one finds for the velocity dispersion @xmath169 and the fourth order moment @xmath170 of the observed losvd  : @xmath171 with @xmath172 and @xmath173 respectively the second and fourth order moments of the intrinsic galaxy losvd and @xmath174 and @xmath175 respectively the second and fourth order moments of the binary losvd .",
    "the fact that we have the fourth order moment of the binary losvd at our disposal allows us to study not only the observed velocity dispersion but also the observed losvd s kurtosis @xmath176 as a function of the binary fraction .    from figures",
    "[ sigalfaps1 ] , [ sigalfaps2 ] and [ sigalfaps3 ] , it is clear that the velocity dispersion of only the most light - weight galaxies will be appreciably affected by their binary population . there",
    ", the velocity dispersion of the observed losvd is presented as a function of the binary fraction for intrinsic gaussian losvds with @xmath163  km / s , @xmath177  km / s and @xmath178  km / s .",
    "the kinematics of the binary population are those of the `` standard '' model",
    ". only if the intrinsic velocity dispersion is of the same order as the binary velocity dispersion , i.e. @xmath179  km / s , is there a noticeable change in the velocity dispersion .",
    "a binary fraction of 60% raises the velocity dispersion of the @xmath163  km / s losvd with 24% , that of the @xmath177  km / s losvd with 7% and that of the @xmath178  km / s losvd with 3% .",
    "these figures , however , yield a surprising result  : whereas the influence of the binary population on the observed velocity dispersion is limited to stellar systems with intrinsic dispersions that are comparable to the binary velocity dispersion , the shape of the observed losvd  as quantified by the kurtosis  is appreciably affected for systems with intrinsic dispersions as high as three times that of the binaries . the kurtosis can be related to a quantity that is of more direct interest to observers : the coefficient of the fourth order term in the expansion of the losvd in gauss - hermite polynomials , @xmath1 ( gerhard @xcite , van der marel  &  franx @xcite )  : @xmath180 e.g. a binary fraction @xmath181 raises the kurtosis of a @xmath177  km / s gaussian to 5.09 ( @xmath182 ) and that of a @xmath183  km / s gaussian to 3.47 ( @xmath184 ) . for stellar systems with lower intrinsic velocity dispersions , the losvds will be even more distinctly non - gaussian .",
    "the maximum additional velocity dispersion due to binary stars is estimated at @xmath185  km / s , in good agreement with other authors . only stellar systems with",
    "intrinsic velocity dispersions comparable to this value will have observed velocity dispersions that are noticeably affected by the presence of binaries , i.e. dwarf spheroidals such as those found in the local group ( dekel  &  silk @xcite ) , globular clusters , low - surface - brightness disk galaxies ( bottema @xcite ) and the central regions of nucleated dwarf ellipticals .",
    "not only the velocity dispersion but also the shape of the galaxy s losvd is altered .",
    "the presence of binaries has a measurable effect on the kurtosis of the observed losvd for stellar systems with a velocity distribution as high as 10  km / s . for stellar systems with lower velocity dispersions",
    ", the losvds will be even more distinctly non - gaussian , being strongly peaked with broad wings .",
    "this feature can mimic radial anisotropy which combined with the enhanced velocity dispersion could lead to an over - estimation of the dark matter content of dsphs and globulars .",
    "if the kinematics of a galaxy are derived from the radial velocities of discrete stars  as is the case for the dwarf spheroidals in the local group  repeated observations can eliminate the binaries from the star sample . methods that rely on integrated light spectra ",
    "e.g. the crowded regions of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies outside the local group  will be plagued by the above mentioned effects .",

    "<S> in this paper , the influence of binary stars on the measured kinematics of dwarf galaxies is investigated . using realistic distributions of the orbital parameters ( semi - major axis , eccentricity ,  ) , analytical expressions are derived for the changes induced by the presence of binary stars in the measured velocity moments of low - mass galaxies ( such as the projected velocity dispersion and the 4@xmath0 order gauss - hermite coefficient @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that there is a noticeable change in the observed velocity dispersion if the intrinsic velocity dispersion of a galaxy is of the same order as the binary velocity dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> the kurtosis of the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) is affected even at higher values of the intrinsic velocity dispersion .    </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the losvd of the binary stars ( i.e. the probability of finding a star in a binary system with a particular projected velocity ) is given in closed form , approximating the constituent stars of all binaries to revolve on circular orbits around each other . with this binary losvd , we calculate the observed losvd , the latter quantifying the movement of stars along the line of sight caused both by the stars orbits through the galaxy and by the motion of stars in binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> as suggested by the changes induced in the moments , the observed losvd becomes more peaked around zero velocity and develops broader high - velocity wings . </S>",
    "<S> these results are important in interpreting kinematics derived from integrated - light spectra of low - mass galaxies and many of the intermediate results are useful for comparison with monte carlo simulations . </S>"
