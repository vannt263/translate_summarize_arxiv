    "semileptonic decay of hadrons are of interest for two basic reasons ; they are the primary source of information for the extraction of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements of the standard model from experiment , and the study of the semileptonic decays of baryons provides information about their structure . in this manuscript , we present results of a calculation of the form factors and rates of the semileptonic decays of heavy @xmath10 baryons ( @xmath6 ) obtained using a constituent quark model .",
    "this work is similar to a recently published calculation of the semileptonic decays of heavy @xmath12 baryons  @xcite ( @xmath13 ) ( hereinafter referred to as i ) .",
    "although our motivation for the present work is similar , it is briefly recapitulated here for completeness .",
    "the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite has been a very powerful tool for the extraction of the ckm matrix elements from data on the semileptonic decay of mesons , especially for the decays of heavy mesons to heavy mesons where a number of relations that simplify this extraction are provided . for",

    "the semileptonic decays @xmath16 , only two functions are required to describe the semileptonic decay in the heavy - quark limit . in the case of a heavy baryon decaying to a light baryon , hqet makes predictions that are not as powerful as in the heavy - to - heavy case . for example , for the semileptonic",
    "decays @xmath17 , the leading - order hqet prediction is that the number of independent form factors decreases from six to four for a daughter @xmath10 with spin 1/2 .",
    "while hqet has been tremendously successful and useful in treating the semileptonic decays of heavy hadrons , it has limitations .",
    "it is a limit of qcd that applies only to hadrons containing heavy quarks , and for the decays of such hadrons , it only predicts the relationships among form factors , not their kinematic dependence .",
    "in addition , the predictions of hqet are valid only as long as the energy of the daughter hadron is much smaller than the mass of the heavy quark .",
    "these limitations mean that the predictions of hqet must be augmented by information arising from other approaches to hadron structure .",
    "while some work has been done in modeling the form factors for the semileptonic decays of heavy baryons , to the best of our knowledge little has been done in treating the decays to excited baryons . in i",
    ", the existing models of semileptonic decay in both meson and baryon sectors have been discussed .",
    "we have also outlined the procedure used to obtain the form factors and decay rates for semileptonic decay of @xmath13 baryons using a non - relativistic quark model . here",
    "we will focus only on the new aspects relevant to the semileptonic decay of @xmath6 .",
    "very little theoretical or experimental work has been published to date on the semileptonic decay of @xmath6 baryons .",
    "boyd and brahm  @xcite have used hqet to show that the fourteen form factors that describe the decays @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be parametrized in terms of two nonperturbative functions at leading order , and in terms of five additional nonperturbative functions and one dimensional constant at order @xmath20 .",
    "a @xmath20 expansion of the form factors for @xmath21 has also been carried out by sutherland  @xcite , who treated the effect of the @xmath22 mass splitting on the form factors evaluated at first order in @xmath20 . a bjorken sum rule for the semileptonic decays of @xmath4 to the ground state and low - lying negative - parity",
    "excited - state charmed baryons has been derived by xu  @xcite , again in the heavy quark limit . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there are no calculations performed outside of the hqet framework , which motivates the present study .",
    "there has recently been some progress in experiments dealing with these decays .",
    "the cleo - c collaboration  @xcite has published evidence for the observation of the decay @xmath23 , and have measured the product of the branching fraction and cross section to be @xmath24 fb . the argus  @xcite and belle  @xcite collaborations have also seen evidence for the @xmath25 decay , but no quantitative value for the branching fraction has yet been published .",
    "the procedure we follow here to calculate the form factors and rates for @xmath6 semileptonic decay is similar to that used for @xmath13 decays in i. in a quark model context the flavor part of the @xmath13 wave function is anti - symmetric under exchange of quarks 1 and 2 , which comprise the light diquark system .",
    "this requires the spin - momentum part of the @xmath13 wave function to be anti - symmetric under exchange of the two light quarks to maintain the appropriate pauli exchange symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath6 baryons are described by a symmetric flavor wave function for the light diquark system . as a result ,",
    "the spin - momentum part of the wave function has to be symmetric .",
    "this basic difference between the wave functions of @xmath13 and @xmath10 makes calculations of the form factors and the corresponding decay rates for their semileptonic decays significantly different .",

    "section iii presents a brief outline of heavy quark effective theory as it relates to the @xmath6 decays that we discuss . in section",
    "iv we describe the model we use to obtain the form factors , including some description of the hamiltonian used to generate baryon wave functions .",
    "our analytic results are discussed and compared to hqet results in section v , our numerical results are given in section vi , and section vii presents our conclusions and an outlook .",
    "a number of details of the calculation , including the explicit expressions for the form factors , are shown in three appendices .",
    "the transition matrix element for the semileptonic decay @xmath26 is written t= v_qq ^(1 - _ 5 ) u__(p , s)| j_| ( p , s ) , where @xmath27 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath28 is the intermediate vector boson mass , @xmath29 is the ckm matrix element , @xmath30 is the lepton current , and @xmath31 is the left handed current between quarks @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the hadronic matrix element of @xmath34 is described in terms of a number of form factors .    for transitions between ground state @xmath35 baryons , the hadronic matrix elements of the vector ( @xmath36 ) and axial ( @xmath37 ) currents",
    "are @xmath38 where the @xmath39 and @xmath40 are form factors which depend on the square of the momentum transfer @xmath41 between the initial and the final baryons .",
    "similar expressions for transitions between @xmath42 ground states and final state baryons with other spins and parities are given in i. if @xmath43 these expressions involve a fourth pair of form factors @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "expressions for the differential decay rates for semileptonic decays both including and ignoring the mass of the final leptons are given in i. these expressions can be integrated to yield the decay rates reported later in the present paper .",
    "in most applications of hqet , the aim has been to constrain the hadronic uncertainties in the extraction of ckm matrix elements such as @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in this section ,",
    "we take a different tack ; we examine the predictions of hqet for decays of a heavy @xmath10 into a number of the allowed excited heavy daughter baryons , with the aim of comparing these predictions with the form factors that we obtain in our model .      in a heavy excited baryon",
    ", the light quark system has some total angular momentum @xmath48 , so that the total angular momentum of the baryon can be @xmath49 .",
    "these two states are degenerate because of the heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "it is useful to show explicitly the representation we use for these two degenerate baryons . in the notation of falk  @xcite",
    ", we write @xmath50 , with = a^_1  _j()u_q ( ) . here , @xmath51 is the spinor of the heavy quark , with @xmath52 being the four - velocity and @xmath53 is a tensor that describes the spin-@xmath48 light quark system .",
    "this tensor is symmetric in all of its lorentz indices , meaning that @xmath54 is also symmetric in all its lorentz indices .",
    "both @xmath55 satisfy the conditions [ vmugmu ] /v^&= & , + _ _ iu^_1  _i  _j&=&0 , g__k_lu^_1  _j(v)=0 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 indicate any pair of the indices @xmath58 .",

    "further details of the structure and properties of these tensors are given in falk s article  @xcite .",
    "at this point , it is useful to discuss the parity of the states , which is determined by the parity of the light component . a spin-@xmath48 light quark component with parity @xmath60",
    "is said to have ` natural ' parity , unnatural parity otherwise .",
    "the natural - parity light quark systems therefore have @xmath61 or @xmath62 , with @xmath63 a positive integer or zero .",
    "the natural - parity light quark systems are represented by tensors , while those with unnatural parity are represented by pseudo - tensors .",
    "since the parity of the baryon is that of the light quark system , we may refer to the baryons as being tensors or pseudo - tensors , with the understanding that this really refers to the light - quark component of the baryon .",
    "it is thus convenient to divide the decays we discuss into two classes , those in which the daughter baryons are tensors , and those in which they are pseudo - tensors .",
    "first , we note that the ground state of the @xmath6 has a symmetric flavor wave function for the light diquark , and so has a spin wave function that is also symmetric , corresponding to a total spin equal to one in the light quark component of the wave function .",
    "this state is therefore the spin-1/2 member of the lowest - lying @xmath64 multiplet .",
    "the falk representation of this state is [ falka ] _",
    "( v)=(_+v_)_5 u(v ) , where @xmath65 is a dirac spinor .",
    "this state is a pseudotensor , and we begin with a discussion of decays to other pseudotensor states .",
    "we are interested in the matrix element = < _ c^(*)(,j)||cb|_b(v ) > , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the heavy quark fields , and @xmath68 is an arbitrary combination of dirac matrices . with the use of hqet ,",
    "we may write this matrix element as [ hqetme ] < _ c^(*)(,j)||cb|_b(v)>=^ m _ , to leading order . here",
