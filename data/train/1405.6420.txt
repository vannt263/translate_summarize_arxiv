    "moreover , we find that the frequent onset and co - operative action of small flares dump enough energy in the solar atmosphere , sufficient to accelerate and heat the plasma in the active corona .",
    "we solve the 3d time - dependent , resistive mhd equations in cartesian geometry , using the bifrost code @xcite .",
    "external resistivity is computed using a hyper - diffusion operator @xcite , which focuses dissipation in regions with steep field gradients .",
    "our experiment is performed in a model that includes the upper convection zone ( with a depth of @xmath7 below the photosphere ) , the photosphere / chromosphere ( @xmath8 and temperature @xmath9 , the transition region where the temperature increases rapidly with height , and the ( @xmath10 ) corona that starts at @xmath11 above the photosphere .",

    "there are individual small flare sites ( shown by arrows in panel a ) . ]",
    "the embedded magnetic flux sheet is distorted by convective upflows / downflows developing loops , which eventually emerge to the photosphere as magnetic bipoles with mixed polarity .",
    "the emergence of the magnetic field above the photosphere is due to the onset of the magnetic buoyancy instability , as has been shown in previous experiments of magnetic flux emergence ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure 1a shows that the emergence and the expansion of the bipoles above the photosphere produces a multi - scale network of magnetic loops ( e.g. a ( @xmath0 ) and c ( @xmath32 ) ) .",
    "reconnection between the emerging loops and the oblique pre - existing field opens the way for the plasma ejecta , which occur during the evolution of the system , to move towards the outer solar atmosphere .",
    "several of the magnetic loops are inter - connected via the same fieldlines in a `` sea - serpent '' manner .",
    "profound interaction occurs between magnetic bipoles that expand and press against each other ( figure 1b ) .",
    "their oppositely directed fieldlines come closer together and strong current layers are built up at their interface .",
    "the field across the interface is strongly sheared .",
    "the resistivity is locally enhanced in the current layers and efficient reconnection of the sheared field leads to dissipation of energy and triggering of small flares ( figure 1c ) .",
    "the onset of a flaring event is illustrated in figure 2 , which shows the plasma evolution across the interface current ( visualized in figure 1b ) .",
    "for @xmath33 , the interacting magnetic loops have expanded into the corona .",
    "figure 2a shows the cool adiabatic expansion of the two interacting loops ( e.g. @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) . at the interface , the current develops into a very long and thin layer ( figure 2c ) , which becomes subject to the resistive tearing instability leading to the formation of cool and dense ( figure 2a , b ) magnetic `` islands '' ( i.e. plasmoids , ( e.g. *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) with x - type reconnection points in between .",
    "eventually ( figure 2e , h ) , the plasmoids move out of the current layer and flux from the emerging loops comes into the interface and reconnects .",
    "this facilitates the eruption of plasmoids , the emission of successive bi - directional flows ( jets ) ( figure 2f , i ) and the disclosure of a small - scale but intense brightening ( i.e. flaring event , figure 2 g ) where the plasma is heated to x - ray temperatures due to joule dissipation via reconnection . after the eruption of the plasmoids we measure the ratio of the inflow towards the diffusion region to the alfven speed around the reconnection site",
    "( see e.g. @xcite for a similar study ) , which is an indication of the reconnection rate .",
    "the average value of this ratio during the dynamical evolution of the interface is @xmath37 , which indicates that the reconnection is fast .",
    "typical values of plasma @xmath38 , around the reconnection regime at the interface , lie in the range 0.01 - 0.1 .",
    "the upward product of reconnection is a jet with a velocity of @xmath39 ( figure 2i ) and temperature up to @xmath40 .",
    "this emission can be observed as a ( soft ) x - ray jet .",
    "the reconnected fieldlines that are released downwards form a small post - flare loop ( figure 2e , h ) , which is heated at the top ( @xmath41 ) by the collision of the downward reconnection jet with the local plasma .",
    "we find that reconnection generates slow - mode shocks that are attached to the ends of the diffusion region ( e.g. at @xmath42 , figure 2i ) .",
    "they exist close ( and along ) to the edges of the two downflows ( shown in figure 2i ) , which adopt an overal inverse v - shape configuration .",
    "the slow shocks is a characteristic feature of the petschek - type reconnection .",
    "most of the conversion of the magnetic energy into heat and bulk kinetic energy ( via reconnection ) occurs at these shocks .",
    "we also find a fast termination shock , which is the result of the collision between the downward reconnection outflow and the post - reconnection loops . in figure 2i , the termination shock is found at @xmath43 .",
    "slow and fast shocks are formed repeatedly during the dynamical evolution of the interface .",
    "the energy released by reconnection is transported along the reconnected fieldlines via thermal conduction , causing flaring of the loop ( figure 2 g ) and heating of the transition region / chromospheric plasma at its footpoints . as magnetic reconnection proceeds in the corona , newly reconnected fieldlines successively pile up on the post - flare loop , which consequently adopts a cusp - like shape ( figure 2h , i , see also figure 3d ) .",
    "the lifetime of the event ( from flaring to cooling by radiation and conduction ) is @xmath44 and the corresponding energy release is @xmath45 .    a similar to the above process",
    "has been invoked by observations @xcite and theoretical models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to explain large ( length @xmath46 ) standard ( e.g. two - ribbon ) flares associated with the eruption of filaments or large plasmoids . here",
    ", we have shown that this mechanism occurs also on much smaller scales ( @xmath0 ) and that it might account for the onset of nano / micro - flares .",
    "moreover , the present model shows that not only one but a cluster of small flares occur along the 3d current layer .",
    "this is illustrated in figures 3 and 4 . at one time",
    ", several plasmoids can exist in the same interface .",
    "they are identified by e.g. a local enhancement in density ( encircled in figure 3b ) .",
    "their ejection leads to patchy reconnection , which in turn gives onset to spatially intermittent heating ( figure 3c , f ) and initiates the individual small flares ( e.g. figure 3a , arrows ) .    due to the tearing instability and the dynamic evolution ( including coalescence ) of the plasmoids , the current layer undergoes fragmentation .",
    "it breaks up into hot `` filaments '' of intense current ( shown later in figure 4c ) , which in fact are smaller dissipation sites emitting distinct bi - directional flows ( figure 3c , f ) .",
    "the above results could explain naturally the intermittent heating in the active solar corona ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on larger scales ,",
    "a similar mechanism might operate to produce the observed multiple downflows above flare loops ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these plasma properties can not be explained by the traditional flare models , which rely on the existence of single ( `` monolithic '' ) current sheets .",
    "the further evolution of the system along the interface reveals an interesting result . for @xmath47 ,",
    "the individual bursts start to become indistinguishable from one another ( figure 3d , g ) .",
    "since the distance between them is very short , the onset and evolution of one flare affects ( even stimulates ) the other by reconfiguring the nearby magnetic field topology . as a result",
    ", we are witnessing a gradual blending of the small flares and the development of another ( larger in energy release ) flare .",
    "therefore , the explosive flaring at @xmath48 ( figure 3 g ) is not an all - time individual brightening but it is the composite effect of the adjacent small flares .",
    "indeed , the onset of the flare at @xmath48 is spatially and temporally associated with the _ joint _ eruption of the neighbouring plasmoids .",

    "the b - field vector ( arrows ) shows the highly sheared field across the interface .",

    "the cusp - shaped reconnected fieldlines ( in yellow ) show the topology of the post - flare loops .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the length of the small two - ribbon flare . ]",
    "figure 4a shows the eruption of plasmoids and the intermittent heating at the interface in the 3d space .",
    "the ( blue ) isosurfaces illustrate the dense core of the plasmoids . underneath , there are the hot filamentary structures of the fragmented current layer .",
    "small flares are produced at the lower part of each filament ( see later in figure 4d ) .",
    "the magnetic fieldlines show the highly twisted nature of the field in and around the plasmoids .",
    "the individual plasmoid fieldlines reconnect rapidly where they intersect and , thus , they become stochastic as they pass through successive plasmoids : fieldlines ( e.g. white and red ) go through the close vicinity of ( at least ) two plasmoids in succession .",
    "this implies that the eruption of one plasmoid can affect or even initiate the eruption of the others .",
    "accordingly , each flare can change the fieldline topology so that other sites start to reconnect and another flare is set off nearby .",
    "this can lead to `` sympathetic '' flaring activity and , ultimately , to profound heating and plasma expulsion as we discussed earlier .",
    "the eruption of plasmoids evolves into helical jets .",
    "this is partially illustrated in figure 4b .",
    "the upward fast reconnection jet ( red ) consists of the twisted fieldlines ( white ) of the plasmoid on its upper part ( at @xmath55 ) . during the emission ,",
    "the erupted plasmoids come into contact with the `` open '' ambient ( non - twisted ) magnetic field and reconnect .",
    "this leads to the formation of helical jets and an untwisting motion along the jets ( for similar studies see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "figure 4b also shows that the hot reconnection plasma underneath the plasmoid is ejected upward by the tension of the reconnected ( v - shaped , white ) fieldlines at the interface . during the evolution ,",
    "similar reconnection events occur at various atmospheric heights ( from the chromosphere up to the corona ) and , thus , we detect the emission of several euv and x - ray jets from the interface .",
    "many of the hot reconnection jets , which are produced at the interface , have velocities comparable to the local alfven speed .",
    "figure 4c displays @xmath53 at @xmath52 ( the same vertical cut as in figure 3 ) .",
    "it is shown that the interface current is not uniform and coherent but it is fragmented .",
    "it consists of thin , individual , filamentary structures of strong current where efficient reconnection occurs .",
    "a comparison with figure 4a shows that there is a good spatial relationship between the sites of profound heating and the places with strong current .",
    "this implies that the intermittent heating is due to the fragmentation of the interface current layer .",
    "figure 4d displays the lower part of the hot filaments ( inverse y - shaped temperature isosurfaces , @xmath56 ) .",
    "reconnected fieldlines form an arcade of loops .",
    "the overal arcade is not the result of a single eruptive flare , as has been previously thought , but it consists of distinct , cusp - like , small eruptive flares , which show up as `` miniature '' version of bigger flares ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "two bright ribbons form on either side of the neutral line , joining the successive footpoints of the post - flare loops . thus",

    "* b ) * the same for the total flare energy per second ( solid line ) and the average flare energy per unit mass ( dashed line ) . the arrow indicates the explosive reconnection event at @xmath59 . ]",
    "the powering of the flares at the interface occurs repetitively over a @xmath60 period : we find more than 20 flares at @xmath61 .",
    "the heat and energy input ( figure 5a , b ) to the chromosphere / corona is highly intermittent , with profound fluctuations in temperature as the plasma is suddenly heated by small flares and subsequently cools down . during the above period",
    ", there is a remarkable temporal ( and spatial ) correlation between heating , energy release and the onset of fast ( @xmath62 ) jets .",
    "this is a direct evidence of reconnection - driven plasma acceleration in small eruptive flares .",
    "similar evolution is found in other interfaces within the numerical domain .",
    "the produced flares appear at random intervals , with an average lifetime of @xmath63 .",
    "they occur at various atmospheric heights ( chromosphere - corona ) and they are capable of heating the plasma to @xmath64 . some of the larger spikes in figure 5b ( e.g. @xmath65 , @xmath66 etc . , solid line ) represent individual energy emissions of @xmath3 .",
    "these events might account for microflares .",
    "however , many of the events with noticeable total energy release ( e.g. around @xmath67 ) is the result of the superposition of small flares , each involving @xmath45 , which is the nano / micro - flare energy regime .    for the small flares that occur in the corona",
    ", we estimate that the average energy flux in the area of integration ( i.e. @xmath68 , as in figure 5 ) is at least @xmath69 .",
    "this estimate , together with the high occurence rate of the flares in the same area , indicates that nano / micro - flares can provide a non - negligible contribution of heating in emerging flux regions and in the active x - ray corona .",
    "moreover , we estimate that the fast upward propagation of plasma , which originates mainly from the flare regimes , carries a vast amount of poynting flux into the corona ( in the range @xmath70 over the whole domain , during @xmath61 ) , part of which could contribute to the mass loading and driving of the solar wind .",
    "we anticipate that the mechanism presented in our numerical experiments may constitute a generic process , which powers eruptive flaring activity of magnetic fields in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas .",
