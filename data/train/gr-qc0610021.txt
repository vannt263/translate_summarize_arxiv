    "the difference of about sixteen orders of magnitude between the electroweak scale ( @xmath2 ) and the planck scale ( @xmath3 ) , is known as the hierarchy problem .",
    "while theoretically there seems to be nothing which can rule out such a difference , it certainly seems a strange thing to be .",
    "figure 1 demonstrates this fact .    2.20 in    of the many attempts to explain the hierarchy problem",
    ", two most recent ones deserve special attention , the proposals themselves being quite simple in themselves .",
    "collectively known as the _ brane world scenarios _ , they assume the existence of one or more spatial dimensions in our universe , in addition to the four spacetimes that we observe . in other words ,",
    "if there are a total of @xmath4 spacetime dimensions , it can be decomposed as : @xmath5 , as shown diagrammatically below :    3.00 in    here it is assumed that both standard model ( sm ) and gravity are present in the observable part of the universe ( ` the brane ' ) , while gravity alone is present in the bulk .",
    "the first brane world scenario , known as the arkani - hamed - dimopoulos - dvali ( add ) model , requires at least @xmath6 ( possibly more ) extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "one may start with the einstein action in @xmath4-spacetime dimensions , @xmath7 and @xmath8 being the @xmath4-dimensional curvature scalar and gravitational constant respectively : s = d^dx  r_d and substitute in it a @xmath4-dimensional metric ansatz of the form : ^2 = ds_4 ^ 2 - dy_i dy^i , where the two terms represent the observed @xmath9-dimensional and the hidden @xmath10-dimensional parts respectively ( index @xmath11 ) . integrating over the unobserved dimensions , one obtains the _ effective _ @xmath9-dimensional action : s & = & d^4 x  r_4 + & & d^4 x  r_4 where the @xmath9-dimensional gravitational constant is given by : g_4 =  . correspondingly , the @xmath4-dimensional and @xmath9-dimensional planck masses are related as : m_pl(d)^d-2 =   = = ( ) ^d-4 m_pl(4)^2  , where we have used : @xmath12 .",
    "now , the four dimensional ( observed ) planck scale is : m_pl(4 ) c^2 = 10 ^ 19 gev  = 10 ^ 16 tev  .",
    "therefore , from ( [ pl1 ] ) , the following possibilities ( and many more ) result : + ( i ) @xmath13 + ( ii ) @xmath14 . + in other words , the @xmath15 or @xmath16-dimensional planck mass can be as low as a @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , these can not be ruled , out since inverse - square law of gravity has been tested to @xmath18 so far .",
    "therefore it is ruled out . ] . as a result",
    ", the hierarchy problem is solved in higher dimensions , where , more precisely , the problem ceases to exist !",
    "next , we come to the second or the randall - sundrum ( rs ) brane world scenario , where one again starts with the action ( [ ee1 ] ) , but instead of the metric ansatz ( [ metric1 ] ) , one uses the following ` warped ' , or non - factorisable metric @xcite : ds_d^2 = e^-a(y ) ds_4 ^ 2 - dy_i dy^i  .",
    "@xmath19 is known as the warp factor .",
    "now , the effective @xmath9-dimensional action , the gravitational constant and the relation between planck masses read as : s & = & d^4x  r_d + & & d^4 x  r_4 + g_4 & = & g_d ^-1 +  m_pl(d)^d-2 & = & ( ) ^d-4 ( ) ^d-4   k^d-4  m_pl(4)^2  . in the above , a warp factor of the form @xmath20 has been assumed , which is a solution of the einstein equations in the rs scenario , as we shall see shortly .",
    "now , if @xmath21 , and our universe ( ` visible brane ' ) is located at @xmath22 , the conformal factor of the metric ( [ metric2 ] ) is of the form @xmath23 .",
    "considering any matter action ( such as that for the higgs field ) with a mass parameter @xmath24 , and integrating over the extra dimension with the metric ( [ metric2 ] ) and the above conformal factor results in the following _ physical mass _ , which is exponentially suppressed : m_h = e^-a(y_0 ) m_0  .",
    "thus if @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then @xmath27 in other words , a small conformal factor explains hierarchy .",
    "the situation is depicted in the figure below , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 being a characteristic length scale , and @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath30 .",
    "the warp factor on the _ hidden brane _ is unity .    2.70 in    now",
    ", we explicitly compute the warp factor in eq.([metric2 ] ) , which is first written in the following form for @xmath21 : ds^2=e^-a ( )  _ dx^dx^ - r^2 d^2  , where the solution for @xmath31 follows from extremising the following action ( @xmath32 ) :    @xmath33\\\\ { } \\nn\\\\ s_{vis } & = &   \\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g_{vis}}~[l_{vis } - v_{vis } ] \\\\ { } \\nn\\\\ s_{hid } & = &   \\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g_{hid}}~[l_{hid } - v_{hid}]~ ,   \\ ] ]    @xmath34 being the @xmath35-dimensional cosmological constant , and @xmath36 and @xmath37 have been set to unity .",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are ( @xmath38 ) : @xmath39}$ will be included here and its effect on the rs scenario studied .",
    "\\section{rs scenario with kalb - ramond field }    we once again start with the metric ansatz ( \\ref{metric3 } ) , with the the kalb - ramond ( kr ) action added to the action ( \\ref{act1 } ) .",
    "\\begin{eqnarray } s & = & s_{gravity } + s_{vis } + s_{hid } + s_{kr }   \\\\ s_{kr } & = & \\int d^4x~r~d{\\phi}\\sqrt{-g}~ [ -2h_{mnl } h^{mnl}]~. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they give rise to the following equations of motion ( which reduce to eq.([eom1 ] ) when @xmath40 ) : @xmath41 \\\\ \\frac{3}{2}({a'}^2-{a''})&=&-\\frac{\\lambda}{4m^3}r^2+\\frac{\\exp(-2a)}{2m^3 } ~\\eta^{\\lambda\\gamma } [ -12\\eta^{ii } h_{\\phi i \\lambda}h_{\\phi i \\gamma}+3\\eta^{\\nu\\beta } h_{\\phi\\nu\\lambda}h_{\\phi\\beta\\gamma } ] ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] remarkably , the above set of equations has a unique solution of the form : e^-a&= &   + c & = & - ^-1 ( ) = -+ ^-1 ( )  , + b^ & = & k^ ( 2kr+2krc ) where the parameter @xmath42 is related to the kr energy density , and @xmath43 is a constant polarisation tensor . requiring @xmath44 on",
    "the hidden brane leads to : = ( 2krc )  .",
    "note that the rs limit corresponds to : @xmath45 .",
    "the counterpart of eq.([warp2 ] ) is now : ( ) ^2 & = & e^-2a|_= = + & = & + & & ( 10 ^ -16)^2  , + inverting which , we get : b = ( 2kr)^2  .",
    "note that , the rs value of @xmath46 corresponds to @xmath47 ( as expected ) . for @xmath48 rs value",
    ", one gets @xmath49 , whereas @xmath50 rs value corresponds to @xmath51 .",
    "the last possibility is unphysical however , since it corresponds to an imaginary metric and warp - factor , as can be seen from eqs.([warp3 ] ) and ( [ warp4 ] ) .",
    "now let us examine the range of ( positive ) values of @xmath42 , which solve the hierarchy problem in this case .",
    "figure 4 shows the plot of @xmath52 vs @xmath46 .",
    "the kink corresponds to the rs value of @xmath46 , for which @xmath47 .",
    "the lhs of the kink corresponds to @xmath51 ( unphysical sector ) , whereas the rhs corresponds to @xmath49 ( physical sector ) .",
    "note that @xmath42 rises to a maximum of @xmath53 at @xmath54 and then falls back to zero .",
    "thus , we see that although @xmath42 has to be non - zero , for any finite value of @xmath46 , it is extremely fine - tuned .",
    "it is interesting to note that such a small value of the kr field was also predicted in a somewhat different context in @xcite .",
    "the hierarchy problems appears to come back in disguise .",
    "this is our main result , which first appeared in @xcite .",
    "2.70 in    next , we compute the induced @xmath9-dim cosmological constant on the visible brane , which is given by @xcite : @xmath55 using ( [ c1 ] ) , we get : @xmath56   \\approx   -24 m^3 k~\\frac{b}{(4kr)^2 } ~ \\approx -10^{-63 } \\ ] ] where in the last step , we have used the ( small ) value of @xmath42 derived earlier .",
    "this is contrary to the currently accepted value of about @xmath57 in planck units .",
    "in this article , we have shown that on inclusion of the anti - symmetric kalb - ramond field , the rs brane world scenario continues to provide a solution to the hierarchy problem , albeit with an extremely fine - tuned value of the kr field . in our opinion , this can be interpreted as the re - appearence of the problem in another guise .",
    "furthermore , the kr field induces a ( small ) negative cosmological constant in the visible universe , which is in variance with the currently accepted ( small ) positive value of the cosmological constant",
    ".    it would be interesting to probe further phenomenological implications of the inclusion of the kr field , as well as those of the dilaton field .",
    "it would also be interesting to see whether brane worlds are stabilised against perturbations when these fields are present @xcite .",
    "while we hope to report on these issues elsewhere @xcite , here we certainly seem to be faced with the general question : if rs brane world the answer to the hierarchy problem ?",
