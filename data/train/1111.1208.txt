    "in order to generate photons in the multidimensional hilbert space defined by the angular momentum of light , and at the same time to be able to modify the dimension and the properties of the corresponding quantum states , we generate photon pairs entangled in the polarization and spatial degrees of freedom @xcite .    if the beam sizes of the pump beam and those of the collection systems of the down - converted photons are large enough , we can neglect the effects of the poynting - vector walk - off that takes place in a birefringent medium @xcite . in this case , the generated paired photons are found to be embedded into lg modes with opposite winding numbers @xmath68 , where @xmath69 refers to the oam of the signal and idler photons , respectively .",

    "<S> the dimension of the system , that is , the number of relevant and independent degrees of freedom needed to describe it , is in general an a priori parameter and represents one of these initial assumptions . in general </S>",
    "<S> , the failure of a theoretical model in predicting experimental data does not necessarily imply that the assumption on the dimensionality is incorrect , as there might exist a different model in a space of the same dimension able to reproduce the observed data .    </S>",

    "<S> the first measurement @xmath66 assigns the dichotomic value of @xmath53 to horizontally polarized photons of @xmath42 and to vertically polarized photons of @xmath47 , and @xmath56 corresponds to vertically polarized photons with @xmath33 ; the second measurement @xmath55 assigns @xmath53 and @xmath56 to horizontally and vertically polarized photons , respectively ; and the third measurement @xmath57 assigns @xmath53 and @xmath56 to oam values of @xmath47 and @xmath46 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the obtained value is @xmath67 , which violates the qutrit threshold by more than 10 standard deviations . in this case , the values of the witness remain constant and are independent of the temporal delay @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed this is because the state is classical ( a statistical mixture of orthogonal quantum states ) and no superposition is present ( see green diamonds of fig .  [ figure3 ] ) .    to conclude , </S>",

    "<S> device - independent techniques ( see also refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) provide an alternative and robust approach to the estimation of quantum systems , especially when compared to most of the existing estimation techniques , such as quantum tomography , which crucially rely on some assumptions about the measured system , e.g. , its hilbert space dimension , that may be questionable in complex setups . </S>",
