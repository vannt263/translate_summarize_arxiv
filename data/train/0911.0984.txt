    "the recent experimental progress on manipulating and cooling fermions has allowed the experimental realization and study of imbalanced fermion gases  @xcite .",
    "an important experimental tool is the trapping of ultracold atoms in optical lattices using which various solid - state systems may be simulated , while the dimensionality of the system may be reduced to 1 or 2 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "however , perhaps the most extraordinary experimental possibility is the tunability of the interparticle interactions using feshbach resonances  @xcite . by adjusting the scattering length",
    "one is able to study the full bec - bcs crossover in which weak interparticle attractions give rise to a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) type coupling while strong interactions lead to the formation of bound pairs which then undergo bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) .",
    "understanding the ground state properties of the _ three - dimensional _ imbalanced three dimensional fermi system is the subject of several recent theoretical works  @xcite .",
    "zero - temperature monte carlo ( mc ) simulations  @xcite , renormalization group ( rg ) calculations  @xcite and a model which incorporates beyond - mean - field and nonzero temperature fluctuations  @xcite were all found to be in reasonable agreement with the mit experiments  @xcite .",
    "the rice group s experiments  @xcite , on the other hand , appear to be incompatible with the local - density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "taking into account surface effects in addition to the lda is believed to be the key to understanding this disagreement  @xcite , although nonequilibrium phenomena may also play a role  @xcite . also recently",
    ", both theoretical and experimental studies of collective excitations with imbalanced fermion gases were performed  @xcite .",
    "the physics of two - dimensional ultracold gases turns out to be significantly different from that of three dimensions . in practice",
    ", a quasi-2d system can be realized using optical lattices .",
    "this has already been done with _ balanced _",
    "fermi mixtures  @xcite . to date , theoretical studies of 2d imbalanced fermion gases have mainly focussed on homogeneous systems and were concerned with the effects of finite temperature  @xcite , the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition  @xcite , fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) states  @xcite , interlayer tunneling  @xcite and critical temperatures  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we explore trapped , imbalanced 2d fermion gases at zero temperature using the mean - field theory for homogeneous phases of ref .  .",
    "we present phase diagrams which depend only on an interaction parameter and the population imbalance .",
    "three relevant trap configurations are identified : a fully normal configuration ( fn ) and two configurations consisting of a superfluid ( sf ) core surrounded by a fully polarized normal ( fpn ) or partially polarized normal ( ppn ) shell , respectively .",
    "the transition between these three configurations can be either continuous or discontinuous .",
    "we also study the influence of a nonzero n - sf surface tension on the phase diagrams and find that it strongly suppresses the ppn phase . using two different approaches",
    ", we then investigate the collective excitations : we model the n phase both hydrodynamically and collisionlessly .",
    "the collective mode spectrum is discontinuous at the first - order transition and has frequencies below the trapping frequency near the continuous transition .",
    "finally , we find that the polarization of the n phase close to the interface has a strong effect on the thermal equilibration process : at low temperatures , energy transport through the n - sf interface is blocked .",
    "experimentally , a quasi-2d regime is established by combining tight confinement along the @xmath0-axis weak harmonic trapping in the @xmath1-plane .",
    "the tight confinement is achieved using an one - dimensional optical lattice , which is modelled by a sinusoidal potential .",
    "the total trapping potential is : @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "if the energy cost of crossing the potential wells along the @xmath0-direction is much larger than the fermi energy , the inter - well tunnelling rate is negligible and the particles are essentially confined in quasi-2d layers . in such a quasi-2d system",
    "a two - particle bound state always exists and has energy  @xcite : @xmath4 where we have introduced @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the 3d s - wave scattering length . within mean - field theory ,",
    "the bound state energy @xmath8 fully characterizes the interparticle interactions and can be used to find qualitative results for the entire bec - bcs transition .",
    "therefore , as opposed to the 3d case , the crossover may be explored not only by tuning the scattering length @xmath7 but also by adjusting the trapping parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "let us now introduce the mean - field formalism which we will use later .",
    "we follow ref .   in which homogeneous systems were thoroughly studied and analytical results were derived",
    ". this theory should be quantitatively correct in the bcs regime but also yields physically relevant results for the entire bec - bcs crossover .",
    "in the following , we consider two homogeneous phases : the normal ( n ) and the superfluid ( sf ) phase . the n phase is taken to consist of a non - interacting mixture of majority ( @xmath11 ) and minority ( @xmath12 ) particles .",
    "the n phase is said to be _ fully polarized _",
    "( fpn ) when the density of the minority species is zero ( @xmath13 ) and _ partially polarized _ ( ppn ) otherwise .",
    "the interactions in the sf phase , on the other hand , are characterized by the bound state energy @xmath8 of eq .  .",
    "as was found both theoretically ( ref .  ) and experimentally ( refs  @xcite ) , the two spin densities are equal in the sf .",
    "we use the local density approximation in which , at each point in the trap , the results for the homogeneous phases are used .    at each point",
    "@xmath14 in the trap , the pressure , @xmath15 and density , @xmath16 , in the n ( @xmath17 ) and sf phases are related by : @xmath18 also , the densities and chemical potentials @xmath19 obey the following relations : @xmath20    within the lda in the @xmath1-plane , @xmath21 for all phases .",
    "we define the length scales @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 : @xmath25 with @xmath17 and @xmath26 . finally , since the sf state is balanced , it consists of an equal @xmath11 and @xmath12 density at each point of the trap .",
    "the n and the sf phases are separated by an interface at radial position @xmath27 where two boundary conditions apply .",
    "first , mechanical equilibrium at the interface demands that the difference of the pressures at the interface must be compensated for by a surface - tension term  @xcite .",
    "this is expressed by laplace s formula  : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the surface tension and @xmath30 means that the quantity is evaluated at the interface .",
    "the second boundary condition pertains to the fact that pairs of opposite - spin particles may cross the interface  @xcite .",
    "therefore , at equilibrium , the energy to _ add _ such a pair of particles in the n phase must be equal to the energy to _ break _ a pair in the sf phase , or : @xmath31 in case the interface is between the sf and the fpn phase , no @xmath12 particles are present in the n phase .",
    "therefore , in eq .",
    "the pressure @xmath32 can be put to zero .",
    "we will later see that in that case , the interface becomes impermeable , that is , no particles can cross the interface , which is as it should be .      using the _ local _ properties mentioned above we can extract _ global _ properties of the trap .",
    "we take the trap to contain @xmath33 particles in total .",
    "the particle numbers of the different spin species @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the population imbalance .",
    "the particle densities of eq .   can be integrated to yield the particle numbers in the n shell , @xmath38 , and in the sf core , @xmath39 :    @xmath40    with @xmath17 .",
    "also , since the sf phase is unpolarized , the total particle number in each spin state is given by @xmath41    we have now established all the ingredients necessary to construct all possible equilibrium states .",
    "this is done by solving the equations above for the variables @xmath42 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "three trap configurations turn out to be of relevance .",
    "first , a trap consisting of a sf core phase surrounded by a _ partially _ polarized normal ( ppn ) shell , which we denote by ppn+sf .",
    "a second configuration , denoted fpn+sf , consists of a sf core phase surrounded by a _",
    "fully _ polarized normal shell  @xcite .",
    "finally , the trap fully normal configuration is simply denoted by fn .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the spin densities of these three trap configurations are shown . the minority spin density",

    "are _ global _ trap characteristics .",
    "in contrast to the ppn+sf configuration , exact analytical expressions may be obtained for the fpn+sf configuration .",
    "full population imbalance at the n - sf interface implies that , at the interface , @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , eqs .   and",
    "reduce to  @xcite :    @xmath53    these equations result in the following radii :    [ radiippn ] @xmath54    and clearly @xmath55 as it must .",

    "the fpn+sf configuration is the one of lowest energy , whereas for large enough @xmath37 , the trap configuration is always fn . at intermediate population imbalances and",

    ".  [ collision ] , we treat a collisionless n phase and are therefore able to treat exactly the collective excitations of the fn and , also of the fpn+sf configurations .",
    "we begin by calculating the expressions for the bulk density fluctuations in the trap for both the sf and the n phase , assuming their dynamics can be described by hydrodynamics .",
    "since we are interested in the lowest - energy frequencies of the trap when subjected to a weak excitation , we consider only the linearized hydrodynamic equations as usual .",

    "we find that at low temperatures , energy flux is exponentially suppressed due to the presence of a sf gap .",
    "this due to the suppression of particles crossing the interface at low temperatures , since heat is transmitted through the n - sf interface when thermally excited particles penetrate the interface .    to understand this ,",
    "consider a n particle incident on to the interface .    if the n phase is partially polarized ( for ppn+sf configurations ) , there are four scattering possibilities : andreev reflection , specular reflection and hole - like and particle - like transmission  @xcite .",
    "a particle undergoing andreev reflection pairs up with a particle of opposite spin to form a cooper pair in the sf and therefore leaves behind a hole in the n phase .",
    "particles penetrating the sf must have a minimum energy @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the sf gap at the interface  @xcite .",
    "however , at sufficiently low temperature @xmath76 , this is rare because of the low statistical weight @xmath158 .",
    "if , on the other hand , the n phase is fully polarized at the interface ( for fpn+sf configurations ) , both andreev reflection and quasiparticle transmission are suppressed so that all n particles must be specularly reflected off the interface .",
    "therefore no energy transport through the interface is possible for fpn+sf configurations   particles .",
    "nevertheless , the thermal conductivity remains very small due to the presence of the sf gap . ] .",
    "we now quanitfy this suppression of energy transport in the case of a ppn+sf configuration . to do this we calculate the heat resistivity of a n - sf interface on the basis of the bogoliubov - de - gennes equations , referring to refs .   and   for details",
    "a brief outline of the followed method is now given .",
    "we model the n - sf interface by its step - like behavior of the gap function : in the n phase @xmath159 , while according to mean - field theory and coexistence condition  @xcite : @xmath160 in the sf .",
    "note that since we consider ppn+sf configurations , @xmath161 .",
    "thermally excited particles and holes which are incoming on the n - sf interface are described by quasiparticle wave functions . matching the wave functions and their derivatives at the interface allows us to calculate the transmission coefficients .",
    "we then calculate the heat conductivity @xmath162 of the n - sf interface which is the net heat flux per temperature difference across the interface .",
    "we find that in case a small temperature bias between n and sf phase exists , the thermal equilibration process will be blocked by a thermal conductivity that decays exponentially fast as the temperature falls . in the limit of very weak interactions @xmath163 and at low temperatures @xmath164 , one can use the andreev approximation to obtain the following analytical expression for the two - dimensional case  @xcite : @xmath165 it is clear that the dominant factor at small temperatures is @xmath166 .",
    "we have found that the approximation of eq .",
    "is in very good agreement with numerically obtained results , even for large values of @xmath167 .",
    "we therefore conclude that , at sufficiently low temperatures , thermal equilibration between n and sf phases at different temperatures will be considerably slowed down due to the sf gap .",
    "although our formalism is only quantitatively correct in the bec regime , we expect that it also yields qualitatively realistic information throughout the entire bec - bcs cross - over  @xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath168 is generally correct in trap center .",
    "we did not take into account the posibility of fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) states  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that such fflo phase would appear between the ppn and the sf .",
    "our results therefore lead us to speculate that the fflo phase would be suppressed by the presence of a nonzero surface tension and the collective excitations as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] would still be correct .    in future work",
    ", we would like to investigate the finite - temperature modifications to the results obtained here . at nonzero @xmath76 ,",
    "the long - range order in the sf is absent in 2d .",
    "this implies the presence of a berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition  @xcite .",
    "we have studied population imbalanced fermi mixtures under quasi two - dimensional confinement . using results previously published for the homogeneous case and using the local density approximation ,",
    "we have shown that there are three relevant configurations of the trapped cloud : fully normal ( fn ) , a partially polarized normal cloud surrounding a superfluid core ( ppn+sf ) and a fully polarized normal cloud surrounding a superfluid core ( fpn+sf ) .",
    "we first show that , in the absence of surface tension , the system is completely specified by two numbers : the polarization , @xmath169 ( where @xmath170 the total number of particles of species @xmath171 ) , and the interaction parameter @xmath69 ( see eqs .   and   for definitions ) .",
    "thus , the phase diagram we obtain ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) is _ universal _ , in the sense that it only depends on a small number of parameters .",
    "this phase diagram has the property that , for @xmath172 ( see eq .  )",
    "there is no critical @xmath173 above which the sf disappears ; in other words , above this @xmath69 , there is sf in the trap for all polarizations .",
    "a finite surface tension destroys this universality , so we have studied systems containing specific numbers of particles .",
    "the qualitative changes in the system s ground state are clear : the sf and ppn phases are suppressed .",
    "we then turn to the calculation of collective excitation modes of the system .",
    "we study these in two approximations .",
    "first we take both the sf and the n parts to behave hydrodynamically . in the fpn+sf case",
    "we find out - of - phase modes , typical of two - component systems ( and which we have also found in previous work on 3-dimensional systems ) . in the ppn+sf case , on the other hand , the presence of three components ( sf , ppn and fpn ) results in an extra set of modes .",
    "we then study the more physically relevant case where the fully polarized n gas displays collisionless behaviour . in this approximation",
    "we calculate the collective mode frequencies and find the expected limits , as well as damping ( related to landau damping ) for a range of polarizations .",
    "finally we discuss the effect of the interface on thermal transport through the cloud .",
    "this would be important in studying how the trapped cloud equilibrates starting from an initially nonuniform temperature distribution , such as might be obtained while the system is being cooled .",
    "based on previously published work , we find that thermal transport is strongly suppressed at low temperatures due to the presence of the gap in the excitation spectrum inside the sf .",
