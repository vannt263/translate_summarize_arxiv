    "one of the most fundamental questions about any type of motion is whether a moving particle starting from a point a is able to reach some pre - selected point b @xcite .",
    "after the concept of random walks was brought to wide attention by karl pearson in 1905 @xcite , for simple random walks on a lattice george plya gave an answer to this question by proving that in one and two dimensions random walks are recurrent , which implies that a walker will visit any lattice site eventually . in three and higher dimensions this motion becomes transient @xcite . for random walks where the jump lengths @xmath2 are drawn from lvy @xmath1-stable distributions , @xmath3 ,",
    "otherwise it is transient @xcite .",
    "however , even if the motion is transient there might be a non - zero probability of visiting a certain point .",
    "for instance the brownian motion is transient in three dimensions , however , there exists a finite probability of return . @xcite . ]",
    "the probability of hitting a given point in space can be directly calculated from the density @xmath4 of the _ first arrival time _ , or hitting time @xmath5 to a specific point , which conveniently characterises the hitting process . integrating @xmath4 over time produces the cumulative probability @xmath6 of reaching this point , called the _ search reliability",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the search reliability is a useful quantity of a search strategy if one is not interested in how long the search might take .",
    "however it does not provide any information about the efficiency of a search process in terms of average times for target location .",
    "such information is crucial to assess real world search scenarios @xcite occurring over a wide range of spatio - temporal scales , from the search of transcription factor proteins for a specific place on a dna chain @xcite over food search by animals @xcite up to rescue operations @xcite or algorithms for finding the minima in a complex search space @xcite .",
    "any good measure of search efficiency must take into account the specific nature of a respective search process , which a searcher may seek to optimise .",
    "brownian motion was considered to be the default for a successful random search strategy in most cases until the 1980ies . in 1986",
    "shlesinger and klafter challenged this dogma suggesting that lvy flights ( lfs ) represent a better strategy if a searcher looks for sparsely distributed targets @xcite . due to",
    "the divergence of the mean squared average of the jump length @xmath2 the trajectory of lfs has a different fractal dimension than the trajectory of brownian motion @xcite .",
    "this allows one to avoid oversampling , i.e. , revisiting the same point several times , which is typical for recurrent brownian motion in one and two dimensions @xcite . in the 1990 s lvy motion",
    "was put forward as an optimal foraging strategy for animals searching for sparse food @xcite and the approach was recently extended to patchy environments @xcite .",
    "this so - called lf hypothesis triggered a vivid debate @xcite in the field of movement ecology @xcite .",
    "it was argued that lvy - like motion has been observed for many animals such as albatrosses @xcite , marine predators @xcite , terrestrial animals like goats and deer @xcite and even microzooplankton @xcite .",
    "heavy - tailed distributions were also reported to characterise human movement patterns @xcite .    however , for certain animals the visual perception of their environment becomes more limited when moving with higher velocity .",
    "observations show that , to remedy this , in these cases the search process alternates between a slow recognition mode during which a target can be found , and fast relocation events where the searcher is insensitive to any target search @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ sketch1 ] .",
    "this poses the need for theoretical modelling to combine saltatory , jump - like , with cruise motion yielding _ intermittent strategies _ , which feature combinations of at least two different types of motion e.g. , brownian and ballistic motion , or brownian motion and lfs @xcite .",
    "a related type of intermittent dynamics is that of composite brownian motion @xcite , which was proposed to model the search of a forager or particle in patchy environments . here",
    "inter and intra patch movements are defined by a combination of brownian modes with different mean step lengths , however , the searcher can detect targets in both modes .",
    "recently it was argued that this type of dynamics was observed in the movements of mussels @xcite .",
    "composite brownian motion can be generalised to an adaptive lvy walk , where the brownian inter - patch movement is replaced by lvy motion @xcite .",
    "intermittent dynamics consisting of brownian and lvy motion has indeed been observed for a number of biological organisms , such as microzooplankton depending on the density of the prey @xcite , coastal jellyfish @xcite , mussels moving in dense environments @xcite and a variety of marine predators hunting in different environments @xcite .",
    "further generalisations of such models use switching rates @xcite , or sample the switching times from one mode to another from different distributions @xcite .",
    "the latter type of modelling was motivated by studying the target search of proteins on fast - folding polymer chains , see fig .",
    "[ sketch2 ] .",
    "formally , these models form special cases of distributed order fractional diffusion equations @xcite or diffusion equations whose laplacian is augmented with a space fractional term @xcite .",
    "they have also been derived as long - time approximations for correlated lvy walks @xcite .",
    "an optimal strategy  in the sense of maximising a chosen efficiency  thus depends at least on the type of motion , the switching distributions and the dimension of the search space @xcite . on a molecular scale the search patterns of regulatory proteins for their target binding site on finite dna chains",
    "is an lf with a cutoff for the jump length distribution , however , the advantage of the combined search modes through the bulk and along the dna significantly improve the search rate @xcite .     and",

    "motivated by the examples of intermittent motion referred to above , we here examine a combined process consisting of both brownian and lvy components .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : after defining the quantities of interest ( the search efficiency and reliability ) in section 2 , section 3 recalls the results for pure brownian and lf search .",
    "sections 4 & 5 , respectively , then present our results for the search reliability and search efficiency . in section 6",
    "we provide a discussion of our results .",
    "details for the analytical calculations are provided in the appendix .",
    "we characterise a search strategy by two different quantities .",
    "the first one is the search reliability , which is the cumulative probability @xmath6 of ever reaching the target .",
    "it can be expressed through the laplace image of first arrival time density@xmath4 as @xcite @xmath8 where the laplace transform of a function @xmath9 is defined via @xmath10 .",
    "the search reliability depends on the type of random walk as well as geometrical details ( dimension , distance from the starting position to the target etc . ) .",
    "thus @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the survival probability @xcite .",
    "the latter quantity can be tackled by solving a ( fractional ) fokker - planck equation with a sink term @xcite . for search in one dimension by lfs without a bias",
    "the search reliability is unity if @xmath13 and zero otherwise @xcite , which is consistent with previous results @xcite . for",
    "search in the presence of a bias the search reliability can vary between zero and unity @xcite , which is true even for brownian motion @xcite , where for the case of the bias pushing a searcher from the target the search reliability is described by an exponential ( boltzmann ) factor @xcite .",
    "a search reliability of unity does not necessarily imply recurrence of the motion .",
    "for instance , lfs with @xmath14 in one dimensional and brownian motion in two dimensions are recurrent but the search reliability is 0 .    the second quantity of interest is the search efficiency . most of the theoretical studies consider a probabilistic searcher with a limited radius of perception . motivated by @xcite , in this case two basic definitions of the search efficiency are considered to be either @xmath15 or @xmath16 the first definition applies especially to _ saltatory search _",
    ", where a searcher moves in a jump - like fashion and is able to detect the target only around the landing point after a jump .",
    "the second formula is adapted to _ cruise motion _",
    ", where the searcher keeps exploring the search space continuously during the whole search process .",
    "an example for the former scenario is given by a regulatory protein that moves in three dimensional space and occasionally binds to the dna of a biological cell until it finds its binding @xcite .",
    "the latter scenario would correspond to an eagle or vulture whose excellent eyesight permits them to scan their environment for food during their entire flight . for lfs eq .",
    "( [ eff1 ] ) presents a natural choice while eq .",
    "( [ eff2 ] ) is better suited for processes like brownian motion and lvy walks @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the limit of a sparse target density , which is approximated by the situation when only one target can be found . for a single target and saltatory motion we argued that the efficiency should be defined from eq .",
    "( [ eff1 ] ) with a proper averaging @xcite . in our continuous time model",
    "the number of steps from ( [ eff1 ] ) is naturally substituted by the time of the process . since we have one target , the number of targets found on average can be less than one . obviously , a time averaging is needed , and , hence",

    "if @xmath57 is constant then the decrease of @xmath1 leads to a monotonic decrease of the efficiency .",
    "secondly , there is a qualitative difference for the brownian - lvy search with @xmath13 and @xmath0 . in the former case ( for which , as we know , lfs without brownian motion",
    "find the target anyway ) the efficiency in the limit of large @xmath57 is proportional to @xmath57 .",
    "a careful calculation shows that in this case @xmath92 ( [ asymptotic ] ) , i.e. , the search efficiency is determined only by lfs .",
    "this is reasonable , because if both processes lead to the location of the target , only the one with a very large noise strength should matter . in the latter case for which pure lfs would not succeed ( @xmath93 ) the asymptotic dependence is of power law form @xmath94 , i.e. even the smallest fraction of brownian motion makes the location of the target possible .",
    "this observation is consistent with the fact that the search reliability does not fall off to zero at @xmath48 ( cf .",
    "[ searchrelalpha ] ) the limiting case @xmath14 shows a logarithmic correction .",
    "an interesting point here is that for @xmath14 pure lf search is absolutely unreliable , @xmath49 , but the smallest contribution of brownian motion makes the search absolutely reliable , @xmath44 .",
    "although fig .",
    "[ effp ] shows the complete dependence of the efficiency on all original parameters @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath37 , and @xmath1 , which are combined into a single parameter @xmath57 , the plot should be interpreted carefully . at first glance",
    "it seems that an increase of @xmath1 leads to an increase of the search efficiency if @xmath97 , i.e. , brownian motion will be the most efficient search strategy .",
    "however , any change of @xmath1 implicitly affects the parameter @xmath57 , compare eq .",
    "( [ ppar ] ) .",
    "even if one assumes that @xmath96 is constant the fractional diffusion coefficient @xmath95 will change its dimension with change of @xmath1 and in order to keep a fixed value of @xmath57 one needs to change the distance from the target .     for fixed @xmath37 , @xmath98.,width=415 ]    in order to fix the starting position and compare the strategies in this practically important case we plot the search efficiency as a function of @xmath1 for fixed @xmath99 , 10 , 20 , 50 cm and @xmath100 , @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ effx0fixed ] .",
    "the curve for @xmath99 cm monotonically increases with @xmath1 , i.e. , the brownian strategy is optimal for finding a nearby target .",
    "however , for larger values of @xmath37 a maximum appears , which shows that the combination of brownian motion with lfs may perform better for larger initial separation from the target similar to the case of pure lf search as discussed in ref .",
    "to summarise , we found that for complex motion which combines lfs for @xmath0 with brownian motion , the search reliability can have intermediate values between zero and unity even if no bias is present . if the lvy stable exponent @xmath1 is larger or equal than unity , then @xmath44 . for a process which combines two lvy motions the qualitative behaviour is the same if one of the exponents is larger than unity . if both of them are smaller than unity , then the process is transient , @xmath49 , and a point - like searcher is unable to find a point - like target .",
    "it is interesting to compare our findings with those for the pure lvy search for a delocalised target  with power - law absorption @xmath102 , i.e. the target is discovered with a power - law decaying probability  in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that case , if the stable index @xmath103 the search still can be absolutely reliable ( @xmath44 ) , if the scaling exponent characterising an absorption probability @xmath104 , i.e. , the target localisation or absorption probability is delocalised stronger than the lf process .",
    "the search efficiency has a universal behaviour as function of the dimensionless parameter @xmath57 , which describes the ratio of the noise intensities of the different modes .",
    "if the characteristic exponent of the lfs is larger than unity  which includes also brownian motion  then for large @xmath57 the efficiency is linear in @xmath57 reflecting the fact that only one of the modes defines the properties of the trajectories .",
    "once @xmath1 becomes unity a logarithmic correction factor appears and the efficiency grows sublinear with @xmath57 . if the lvy exponent @xmath1 is less than unity , the efficiency grows with @xmath57 as a sublinear power law .",
    "the latter case shows that even for high intensity of lf search with @xmath0 the local search provided by brownian motion matters and quantitatively affects the search efficiency .",
    "the optimisation of a combined search strategy of lfs with stable index @xmath1 and brownian motion shows that for targets in the close vicinity of the starting point one should use more local search strategies , i.e. , @xmath1 should be close to 2 , while for distant targets a larger fraction of long jumps increases the search efficiency .",
    "this result is consistent with the one - mode case in which lfs are confronted with brownian motion @xcite",
