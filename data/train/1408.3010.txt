    "the unavoidable interaction of a quantum system with its environment generally causes decoherence and a loss of quantumness . on the other hand ,",
    "the possibility to perform quantum operations within the coherence time of a quantum system lies at the heart of quantum information processing . a deep understanding of the decoherence mechanisms in quantum systems , together with the capability to engineer the environment in order to reduce its detrimental effects , are thus essential steps toward the development of quantum technologies .",

    "we quantitatively compare the degrading effects of different kinds of environments by defining the _ entanglement - preserving time _ and the _ entanglement - survival time _ and by studying their dependence on the nature and on the parameters of the stochastic process that models the environment .",

    "<S> we address the dynamics of a two - qubit system interacting with a classical dephasing environment driven by a gaussian stochastic process . upon introducing the concept of _ entanglement - preserving time _ , we compare the degrading effects of different environments , e.g. those described by ornstein - uhlenbeck or fractional noise . in particular , we consider pure bell states and mixtures of bell states and study the typical values of the entanglement - preserving time for both independent and common environments . </S>",
    "<S> we found that engineering environments towards fractional gaussian noise is useful to preserve entanglement as well as to improve its robustness against noise . </S>",
    "<S> we also address entanglement sudden death by studying the _ entanglement - survival time _ as a function of the initial negativity . </S>",
    "<S> we found that : i ) the survival time is bounded from below by an increasing function of the initial negativity , ii ) the survival time depends only slightly on the process used to describe the environment and exhibits typicality . </S>",
    "<S> overall , our results show that engineering the environment has only a slight influence over the entanglement - survival time , i.e. the occurence of entanglement sudden - death , while it represents a valuable resource to increase the entanglement - preserving time , i.e. to maintain entanglement closer to the initial level for a longer interaction time . </S>"
