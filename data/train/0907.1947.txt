    "the nucleon - nucleon centre of mass energy for the pb - pb collisions at lhc , @xmath0 = 5.5 tev , will exceed that available at rhic ( the relativistic heavy ion collider ) by a factor about 30 , opening up a new domain for the study of strongly interacting matter in conditions of high temperature ( factor 3 to 5 higher than the critical temperature ) and high energy density ( 15 to 60 gev/@xmath1 ) .",
    "qcd calculations[1 ] at high temperature and high energy density predict a phase transition from hadron gas to quark - gluon plasma ( a deconfined state of matter ) . in the study of the properties of",
    "the produced ( deconfined ) state , heavy quarks play a crucial role .",
    "heavy quarks and hard partons , abundantly produced at lhc energies in the initial hard scattering processes , are sensitive probes of the medium formed in the collisions as they may lose energy by gluon radiation while propagating through the medium itself . at lhc energies ( @xmath2 = 14 tev for p - p and @xmath0 = 5.5 tev for pb - pb collisions )",
    ", the production of charm and beauty will be abundant .",
    "the cross - sections at lhc are expected to increase by about a factor of 10 for charm and 100 for beauty with respect to rhic .",
    "the baseline production cross - section of q@xmath3 pairs for alice simulation studies has been calculated in the framework of collinear factorization and pqcd[2 ] , including the nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs)[3 ] .",
    "the expected c@xmath4 and b@xmath5 production yields for pp collisions at @xmath2 = 14 tev are 0.16 and 0.0072 , respectively[4 ] .",
    "for the 5 % most central pb - pb collisions at @xmath0 = 5.5 tev , the expected yields are 115 and 4.6 respectively .",
    "it has to be noted that these predictions have large uncertainties , of about a factor 2 to 3 , depending on the choice of the quark masses and qcd scales .",
    "the alice experimental setup , described in detail in [ 4 ] , has excellent capabilities for heavy flavour measurements .",
    "experimentally , the two key elements for a rich heavy - flavour program are : tracking / vertexing and particle identification .",
    "* tracking / vertexing * : particle tracking relies on the six concentric layers of high resolution silicon detectors of the inner tracking system ( its ) , a large volume of time projection chamber ( tpc ) ] , and a high granularity transition - radiation detector ( trd ) .",
    "the alice detection strategy for charm and beauty hadrons relies on resolving secondary detached vertices reconstructed from tracks with large impact parameters ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the precision in impact parameter measurement is mainly provided by : two innermost its layers ( spd ) in the bending plane ( r@xmath7 ) & two intermediate its layer ( sdd ) for z - coordinate . a resolution ( @xmath8 ) better than 60@xmath9",
    "m in the bending plane is achieved for tracks with @xmath10 1.5 gev / c . *",
    "particle identification * : in the central region , particle identification is performed over the full azimuth by a de / dx measurement in the tracking detectors ( tpc and its ) , via time of flight measurement using time of flight detector(tof ) and transition radiation measurement in the transition radiation detector ( trd ) .",
    "an intensive simulation study of the alice performance for the reconstruction of d mesons from hadronic decays has been already done using the decay channels @xmath11 [ 5,6 ] , @xmath12[7 ] and @xmath13 whereas other channels like @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 kp are under study .",
    "it is important to measure the production of as many as charm hadrons as possible because the measurement of their relative yield ( e.g @xmath17(c@xmath18)/@xmath19(c@xmath20 ) ) can provide information on the hadronization mechanism ( e.g string fragmentation and recombination ) and it allows to reduce the systematic error on the absolute cross - section .",
    "* charm reconstruction in the @xmath11 decay channel : * the first study in alice on open charmed mesons was performed on @xmath21 mesons through their two body hadronic channel @xmath22 , which is the simplest decay topology .",
    "two main variables are used to separate the signal from the combinatorial background of opposite sign track pairs : the product of the impact parameters of the two tracks ( @xmath23 ) and the cosine of the pointing angle ( @xmath24 ) momentum and the @xmath21 flight line ] . by performing a selection based on these two variables , it is possible to improve the signal to background ratio by more than a factor of @xmath25 .     transverse momentum for pb - pb ( right ) and pp ( left ) collision[5,6].__,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    transverse momentum for pb - pb ( right ) and pp ( left ) collision[5,6].__,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    figure  [ d0 ] shows the significance(s/@xmath26 ) as a function of @xmath27 in bins of 1 gev / c . the relative statistical error on total @xmath28 integrated charm cross - section in one year of data taking at nominal luminosity",
    "are expected to be smaller than 20% [ 8 ] . +",
    "* charm reconstruction in the @xmath29 decay channel : * extracting a @xmath19 signal with a good significance requires a drastic selection procedure to reduce the huge combinatorial background by at least 8 - 9 orders of magnitude .",
    "the main variables to separate the signal from huge combinatorial background of the three charged track combinations are : the distance between the primary and secondary vertex and the cosine of pointing angle ( @xmath24 ) .     transverse momentum for pp ( @xmath30 events ) and pb - pb ( @xmath31 events)__,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    if the found vertex really corresponds to the a @xmath19 vertex , then @xmath32 0 and cos@xmath32 1 .",
    "the significance as a function of @xmath33 transverse momentum in bins of 1 gev / c is shown in figure  [ significance ] .",
    "the plot confirms that there is good feasibility of reconstruction of @xmath34 mesons in pp and pb - pb collision in the first year of data taking even in the worst scenario where the particle identification information is not used . +",
    "* charm reconstruction in the @xmath35 decay channel : * the reconstruction of @xmath36 meson is a very challenging task as the yield of @xmath36 against the huge combinatorial background is very low .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath36 mesons preferentially decay through intermediate resonant states and this fact can improve the separation of signal from background . from the simulation studies of this decay channel",
    "( see [ 9 ] ) , we observed that the reconstruction of @xmath36 mesons is feasible for @xmath28 down to 3 - 4 gev / c , even without particle identification , by exploiting the @xmath37 decay .",
    "the measured spectra in pp and pb - pb can be used to compute the nuclear modification factor , @xmath38 .",
    "this observable is supposed to be 1 if the nucleus - nucleus collision behaves as a simple superposition of independent nucleon - nucleon collisions .",

    "scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the expected performance for the measurement of the nuclear modification factor for @xmath21 and @xmath19 mesons after one year of data taking at nominal luminosity is shown in figure  [ energy_loss ] .",
    "theoretical calculations for different energy loss scenarios depending on the in - medium transport coefficient @xmath39 and on the c - quark mass are also shown .",
    "the bands corresponding to @xmath40 = 1.2 gev and @xmath39= 25 - 100 @xmath41/fm reflects the estimated uncertainty on the model expectations for @xmath42 .",
    "the small difference between the two bands ( @xmath40=0 and @xmath40=1.2 gev ) indicates that with respect to energy loss , charm behaves similarly to light quarks .",
    "therefore , the enhancement of the heavy to light ratio is a sensitive measurement , essentially free of mass effects , to study the colour charge dependence of parton energy loss[10 ] .",
    "flow , in particular elliptic flow[11 ] , is an important experimental probe which provides information about thermalization of the medium created in non - central heavy ion collision . here",
    "we will show the expected performance for the measurement of @xmath19 @xmath43 as a function of @xmath27 with alice .",
    "meson @xmath43 as a function of @xmath27 in centrality class @xmath44 fm.__,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    as shown in figure  [ flow ] , we have compared two cases : minimum bias trigger ( left panel ) and semi - peripheral trigger ( right panel ) .",
    "the lines represent the prediction for @xmath34 meson @xmath45 in the case of charm flow and without charm flow . the statistical errors on @xmath46 in 2 @xmath47",
    "minimum bias events are pretty large whereas in case 2@xmath47 semi - peripheral events with 6 @xmath48 9 fm , the statistical errors appreciably reduced and thus , @xmath43 as a function of @xmath27 is significally improved down to @xmath49 1 gev / c .",
    "with its excellent tracking , vertexing and particle identification capabilities , alice has very promising prospectives for the studies of charm production in the hadronic decays .",
    "we have shown that , there is good feasibility of reconstruction of d - mesons with a good significance both in pb - pb and pp collisions in one year of data taking at nominal luminosity .",
    "this will allow to measure with good precision the energy loss and the azimuthal anisotropy of the charm particles .",
