    "since the development of quantum well lasers there have been continuous attempts to manufacture laser structures with even more reduced dimensions .",
    "the idea behind was to increase the efficiency by enhancing the density of states .",
    "however , zero - dimensional quantum structures ( quantum dots ) are characterized by a discrete spectrum , and the recombination probability does not depend on the radiative rate alone .",
    "rather , the relaxation pathway into the groundstate becomes decisive .",
    "looking at the nearly monoenergetic longitudinal - optical ( lo ) phonons , an efficient relaxation between two dot levels seems to be possible only if level distance and lo energy match ( resonance condition ) .",
    "this type of argument has been called phonon bottleneck .",
    "@xcite    > from the experimental side there is an ongoing intense debate on whether or not the phonon bottleneck is seen in the data.@xcite however , the recently found groundstate lasing in quantum dots under cw conditions seems to prove that the phonon bottleneck is not an obstacle when trying to increase the laser efficiency by dimensional reduction.@xcite    nevertheless the theoretical concepts are still controversial .",
    "obviously , the bottleneck argument relies on the assumption of strict energy conservation in the electron - phonon scattering , as dictated by fermi s golden rule .",
    "a next step towards a realistic description seems to incorporate the intrinsic lifetime broadening of dot levels .",
    "et al._@xcite went along this way by calculating the complex electron selfenergy due to lo - phonon interaction .",
    "they claimed that the convolution of initial and final state spectral functions gives rise to a broadening which is able to circumvent the phonon bottleneck .",
    "arakawa and coworkers@xcite have treated the electronic transition and the lo modes in closed form by wave function evolution .",
    "they pointed out that the final decay of the lo phonon into acoustic phonons is decisive for the relaxation process .",
    "a different argument includes auger - like electronic excitation for overcoming the sharp energy selection inherent to the lo - phonon relaxation.@xcite    a more general question concerns the appropriate theoretical tools for describing relaxation in zero - dimensional systems .",
    "non - equilibrium green s functions are often too tedious to be used in realistic models .",
    "therefore one is tempted to look for the one - particle green s functions and their broadening as a signature for relaxation.@xcite however , standard selfenergy approaches as the selfconsistent first - order born approximation @xcite have to be questioned since they rely implicitly on the existence of an electronic continuum which is missing in zerodimensional systems .    in this paper",
    "we want to look closely at this question and to qualify the standard approximation schemes ( as the selfconsistent born approximation ) in application to quantum dots .",
    "to compare with we present results from an exact diagonalization of the electron - phonon hamiltonian .",
    "this can be achieved even for an unlimited number of phonon modes provided they have _ no dispersion _ , and uses a unitary transformation among the phonons . if @xmath0 electronic dot states ( fermions ) are considered , only @xmath1 of the new modes ( bosons ) couple to the electrons , and for moderate numbers of @xmath0 the transformed hamiltonian can be easily diagonalized numerically .",
    "an upper limit of the boson occupation numbers can be fixed in accordance with temperature . for @xmath2 ,",
    "this exact solution is known for a long time as _ independent boson model_.@xcite to the best of our knowledge , the extension to a finite number of levels with the important interlevel coupling ( phonon transition ) is presented here for the first time .",
    "single _ boson mode in resonance with an equidistant series of electronic levels has been treated exactly in ref .",
    "predicting the phonon staircase effect .",
    "a related problem is the electron - phonon coupling in semiconductor point defects .",
    "both the internal defect transitions in the near infrared and the phonon satellites of interband transitions show a rich spectrum . even away from strict resonance with an electronic transition ,",
    "the measured transition energies differ from the bare phonon value .",
    "this has been called lo phonon - donor bound state , similar to the exciton - phonon complex introduced earlier.@xcite in first attempts for a quantitative understanding , perturbation theory has been used.@xcite the crystallographic symmetry of the defect dictates what kind of lattice distortion ( local phonon mode ) couples to the electronic transitions .",
    "taking into account only a few of these symmetry - adapted lattice modes , a full numerical diagonalization is possible nowadays.@xcite this is in particular important when dealing with strongly polar material .",
    "we show that semiconductor quantum dots behave similarly with respect to the lattice coupling , underlining once more that the quantum dot behaves as a kind of mesoscopic atom .",
    "note , however , the quite different length scales involved . whereas the local modes in the defect problem are constructed using large parts of the brillouin zone , only a minor part around the @xmath3 point is involved in the quantum dot case .",
    "consequently , the lo phonon dispersion can be safely neglected here .    in section",
    "ii the method is outlined and applied to the most simple but nontrivial case of two dot levels .",
    "results for the spectral function are given in section iii .",
    "it shows a kind of avoided level crossing if level distance and phonon energy nearly coincide , which resembles the phonon polariton feature .",
    "still , the exact spectral function consists of a series of sharp lines .",
    "the selfconsistent first order born approximation fails in this respect by exhibiting broad spectral features .",
    "however , we are able to derive a simple analytical approximation which almost coincides with the exact results .",
    "this employs degenerate perturbation theory for those electron - phonon states which are strongly coupled near resonance .",
    "it is called rotating wave approximation since it sesemble a similar treatment of the jaynes - cummings model in quantum optics .",
    "some consequences of the present work on the general description of relaxation in quantum dots are given as well , and conclusions are drawn in section iv . in the appendix ,",
    "the coupling constants are calculated adopting parameter values for an idealized gaas quantum dot with parabolic confinement .",
    "let us consider @xmath0 discrete electronic levels @xmath4 coupled to @xmath5 phonon modes @xmath6 of fixed energy @xmath7 .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath8 here , the @xmath9 denote the fermionic creation ( annihilation ) operators , respectively , and @xmath10 are the corresponding bosonic operators .",
    "the coupling constants between phonons and electrons , @xmath11 , depend explicitly on the fermionic states involved ( transitions between dot levels ) .",
    "for @xmath12 to be hermitean , @xmath13 must hold . for simplicity , the spin is neglected because it is conserved by the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "since all @xmath5 bosonic modes couple to the electronic levels , a straightforward diagonalization is not feasible .",
    "we proceed by mapping the phonon operators @xmath14 onto a new set of bosonic operators @xmath15 , with the goal that only a limited number couples to the electrons .",
    "we start with an arbitrary linear combination of the operators @xmath16 written as @xmath17 with @xmath18 , which also span the bosonic hilbert space . following the well - known gram - schmidt orthogonalization procedure , @xmath19 \\ , b_{\\alpha } \\ ; , \\ ; \\ ;   b_\\lambda = \\widetilde{b}_{\\lambda}/ \\sqrt{[\\widetilde{b}_{\\lambda},\\widetilde{b}_{\\lambda}^{\\dagger}]}\\ ] ] we arrive at a new set @xmath20 whose members obey the canonical bose commutation relations , @xmath21=\\delta_{\\lambda,\\lambda'}$ ] .",
    "then , the transformation matrix @xmath22 with @xmath23 is unitary , and we have @xmath24 since the bosonic modes have the _ same energy _ , the last relation shows that the free boson term in the hamiltonian eq.([themodel0 ] ) remains diagonal .",
    "the first linear combinations are chosen as @xmath25 where @xmath26 runs over the @xmath1 pairs @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the remaining @xmath29 can be taken arbitraryly but linearly independent .",
    "it follows from the prescribed one - to - one mapping that the electron - phonon interaction contains only the restricted set @xmath26 of the new operators .",
    "this reduces the numerical labour enormously since the relevant hilbert space contains now @xmath0 fermionic and only @xmath1 bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the model can be used to describe electrons in a quantum dot which are coupled to lo - phonons . under the assumption that the third electronic level is energetically well above the lowest two",
    ", we will limit the number of states to @xmath30 .",
    "choosing @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 we accomplish that the transition matrix element couples only to _ three _ non - trivial bosonic modes .",
    "we obtain @xmath34 with the six coupling constants @xmath35 which follow from the transformation ( [ gramschmidt ] ) .",
    "if we further assume that the electronic wavefunctions in the quantum dot exhibit a well - defined parity , the constants @xmath36 and @xmath37 vanish , and @xmath38 couples only to the transition @xmath39 .",
    "the model will therefore show prominent features of the jaynes - cummings model@xcite which has been introduced to describe a single photon mode coupled to an atomic transition . in the present case",
    ", however , the detuning has to be defined as @xmath40 .",
    "further details regarding the explicit calculation of the coupling constants @xmath35 are given in appendix [ sixconstants ] .",
    "we adopt a parabolic confinement potential with extensions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , having in mind an anisotropic harmonic quantum dot . in this case , all the lowest dot levels have equal energy separation , and the mentioned truncation to just two levels is not realistic .",
    "nevertheless it will be applied here to keep the numerics at a reasonable level .    by means of an appropriate rotation of the operators @xmath43 and @xmath44 , i. e. @xmath45 with @xmath46 , we manage that the new mode @xmath44 only couples to the fermionic particle number operator @xmath47 . if we leave out the bosonic modes which do not couple to the fermionic levels at all we obtain @xmath48 with the new parameters @xmath49 the hamiltonian conserves the electron number , @xmath50 = 0 $ ] , and consequently the hilbert space can be decomposed according to the electron number ( zero , one , or two ) . in the subspace of zero or two fermions",
    ", the hamiltonian can be diagonalized easily because the nondiagonal transitions @xmath51 are impossible here .",
    "more demanding is the subspace of one fermion , which can , however , be rationalized a lot by introducing shifted operators @xmath52 note that from eq.([bshifted ] ) onward , the lo energy @xmath53 is taken as unit of energy in the remainder of this section .",
    "we want to stress that the shifted bosonic operators @xmath54 and @xmath55 still obey the canonical commutation rules , but do not commute with the fermion operators .",
    "the hamiltonian eq.([themodel2 ] ) is now represented as @xmath56 with the modified energies depending of the number of particles @xmath57    the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ parameter ] shows the ( dimensionless ) parameters calculated for a parabolic confinement potential with extensions of @xmath58 nm as a function of @xmath59 .",
    "all input parameters refer to gaas , e.g. @xmath60mev ( see appendix [ sixconstants ] ) .",
    "the coupling constants are almost independent of the dot size and of order @xmath61 .",
    "this value of 3.6mev compares favourably with the polaron shift of electrons in bulk gaas , 2.3mev .    the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ parameter ] shows the polaronic shift due to the phonons @xmath43 and @xmath44 , eq.([polaronshift ] ) , and the renormalisation of the level spacing eq.([levelshift ] ) .",
    "since both depend on the number of electrons present , we display the relative shifts when adding one electron , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath64 for the @xmath0-electron hilbert space with @xmath65 are simple and given by @xmath66 here , @xmath67 denotes the electron vacuum , and @xmath68 are the shifted oscillator eigenstates ( or coherent states ) whose vacuum is defined as @xmath69 .",
    "we will omit the upper index @xmath70 of the bosonic states from now on since confusions are unlikely .    considering the @xmath2 hilbert space the hamiltonian",
    "can be easily diagonalized numerically since only _ two _ bosonic modes are involved .",
    "an approximate analytical solution is possible as well , where the transition matrix element is treated in degenerate perturbation theory , using the coherent states eq.([coherentstate ] ) as basis . in oder to show the basic features of this analytic solution we neglect for the moment the third bosonic mode @xmath55 which reduces the number of quantum numbers that have to be kept track of .",
    "since this mode commutes with the rest of the system , it can easily be incorporated afterwards . in the same spirit",
    "we neglect the polaronic shift ( [ polaronshift ] ) and the shift of the level spacing ( [ levelshift ] ) which are restored , however , in the numerics .    in the resonant situation ( zero detuning @xmath71 ) and neglecting terms of the order @xmath72 , _ degenerate _ pertubation theory leads to the level repulsion ( or avoided level crossing ) @xmath73 for @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",
    "the overlap integrals of two displaced oscillators appearing in eq.([degpert ] ) are also known as franck - condon factors which were first introduced in the theory of excited molecules .",
    "more generally they are given by @xmath76 and are related to the associated laguerre polynomials .",
    "since the franck - condon factors @xmath77 are oscillating as functions of @xmath78 we find a complex level structure if many bosons are present , i.e. at elevated temperatures .",
    "introducing a small external broadening will lead to a continuous but still highly structured spectral function .",
    "the energy splitting of eq.([degpert ] ) can be recovered in a truncated hamiltonian where only the nearly resonant transitions @xmath39 with phonon absorption and @xmath79 with phonon emission are kept , @xmath80 in analogy to the optical equivalent in the jaynes - cummings model , we use the term _ rotating wave approximation _ ( rw ) .",
    "@xmath81 can be represented by 2x2-matrices @xcite in the basis latexmath:[\\ ] ] the standard frhlich coupling for the electron - lo - phonon interaction is adopted and applied to the dot confinement states , @xmath139 for simplicity we consider an anisotropic parabolic potential as dot confinement , with @xmath140 as the long axis .",
    "the two energetically lowest wave functions read @xmath141 where @xmath142 are the spatial extensions ( variances ) of the groundstate .",
    "the relevant level distance is @xmath143 the matrix elements in eq.([psi ] ) read @xmath144 the final integration over @xmath145 leads to @xmath146 , @xmath147 on account of the well - defined parity of the wave functions .",
    "the other constants can be reduced to the following ( elliptic ) integrals , @xmath148^{-1/2}\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "we obtain finally @xmath151 for the numerical calculations we choose material constants of gaas ,",
    "i.e.  lo phonon energy @xmath60mev , conduction band mass @xmath152 , and dielectric constants @xmath153 , @xmath154",
    ". according to eq.([leveldist ] ) , a ( long ) dot extension of @xmath155 nm gives resonance between level spacing and lo energy .",
    "the effective dot extensions in @xmath156 and @xmath157 direction are taken equal , @xmath158 nm , which renders the elliptic integrals ( [ in ] ) to be simple logarithmic functions .",
