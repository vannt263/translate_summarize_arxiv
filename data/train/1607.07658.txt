    "in the paper we study the gusein - zade version of a generalized secretary problem ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "there are many ways for presenting this optimal stopping problem . in the romantic version , instead of interviewing the candidates for a secretary , we have a bachelor who has an occasion to meet a certain number of girls during his bachelorhood and who found out about this number ( denoted further by @xmath2 ) in some miraculous way .",
    "the bachelor wants to marry one of the @xmath1 best girls , where @xmath1 is fixed and less than @xmath2 .",
    "he can not be sure of success as he follows in his live the following principles : in every time he gets to know only one of the girls and after some time he must decide to marry her or to split up . in the latter case he starts to meet the next girl , but later on he can not go back to any girl he decided to split up .",
    "the order in which he gets to know the girls is random , thus there are @xmath10 equally likely orderings .",
    "the bachelor is able to judge only the present girl or the girls he met previously , and he has no idea about the attraction of the future girls .",
    "however , we assume that no two girls will turn out equally attractive for him .",
    "the problem is to find the best policy for the bachelor , i.e. the policy which maximizes the probability of the marriage to the girl that is one of the @xmath1 best . in the paper  @xcite it",
    "was proved the following general structure of such a policy :    [ p1 ] the best policy for a bachelor who wants to marry one of the @xmath1 best girls is described by a certain non  decreasing sequence @xmath3 of integers with @xmath4 for every @xmath5 in the following way : marry the @xmath11-th girl , where @xmath12 is the smallest integer such that there is @xmath5 which satisfies :    * @xmath13 ( assume @xmath14 ) , * the @xmath11-th girl is one of the @xmath15 best of @xmath11 girls met so far .",
    "if such a number @xmath11 does not exists , then marry the @xmath2-th girl .    given an arbitrary non  decreasing sequence @xmath3 of integers such that @xmath4 for every @xmath5 , it is natural to ask about the probability of success when using the above described policy with the sequence @xmath3 .",
    "namely , we would like to know how this probability depends on the elements of this sequence and how to construct a sequence which maximizes this probability .",
    "[ ddddef ] we call a sequence @xmath3 which maximizes the probability of success for the policy described in proposition  [ p1 ] as an _ optimal sequence_.    the classical version , i.e. the case @xmath16 , was solved by lindley ( @xcite ) by using equations arising from the principle of dynamic programming .",
    "he solved these equations by simple backward recursion and obtained that the only element of an optimal sequence is equal to the smallest integer @xmath17 such that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the @xmath20-th harmonic number , as well as that the probability of success when using the optimal policy with an element @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 ( see also  @xcite for the survey paper ) .",
    "the cases @xmath23 were solved by using backward induction and exploiting the existence of an imbedded markov chain . in the case @xmath24 the corresponding analytic expressions were stated by gilbert and mosteller ( @xcite ) and the proof was outlined by dynkin and yushkevich ( @xcite ) .",
    "the case @xmath25 was derived by quine and law ( @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we extended to an arbitrary value of @xmath1 the formula for an optimal sequence in the following way .",
    "[ mt ] let @xmath3 be a sequence such that @xmath26 for every @xmath5 , where each @xmath27 is defined as the smallest integer @xmath28 satisfying the inequality @xmath29 where @xmath30 and the map @xmath31 is defined for each @xmath32 as follows : @xmath33 then @xmath3 is an optimal sequence .    in the right side of ( [ ineqqq ] )",
    "we use the standard conventions for the empty sum and the empty product and evaluate them to 0 and to 1 , respectively .",
    "in particular , for @xmath7 the right side of ( [ ineqqq ] ) just equals @xmath34 .",
    "hence , the above formula allows to calculate the elements @xmath6 ( @xmath5 ) one by one , from @xmath7 down to @xmath8 .    in the present paper we also proved the following    [ mtt ] the probability of success for the policy described in proposition  [ p1 ] is equal to @xmath35 where @xmath36 for @xmath5 .",
    "the known constructions of the optimal sequence via analytic expressions were presented in the similar form as in theorem  [ mt ] but , as we have mentioned above , only in the cases @xmath37 . for higher values of @xmath1 , as well as for some other versions of this problem , the algorithms computing the probability of success and the elements of an optimal sequence can be found in various of papers ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , in contrast to the analytic solution , these methods apply mechanisms via dynamic or linear programming , and hence only numerically allow to determine the elements of an optimal sequence .",
    "our proofs are purely elementary and only combinatorial arguments are used . at first , since no two girls are equally attractive for the bachelor , we assign the rank to each girl , which is an integer from 1 to @xmath2 , i.e. the rank 1 to the best girl , the rank 2 to the next best girl and so on .",
    "then each of the possible @xmath10 orderings of the girls defines uniquely a permutation @xmath38 of the set @xmath39 such that @xmath40 is the rank of the @xmath41-th girl for every @xmath42 , and conversely , any permutation @xmath38 of the set @xmath39 defines in the obvious way the possible ordering of the girls .",
    "let @xmath43 be a non - decreasing sequence such that @xmath4 for every @xmath44 and let us assume that the policy from proposition  [ p1 ] is used with the sequence @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath38 be a permutation defining the ordering of the girls .",
    "if the policy successfully chooses a candidate of top @xmath1 , then we say that @xmath38 is a _",
    "lucky permutation corresponding to @xmath45_. we distinguish the case when there exists @xmath44 such that for some @xmath46 the following two conditions hold :    * @xmath47 , * among the first @xmath41 girls , there are at most @xmath48 girls which are more attractive than the @xmath41-th girl ( equivalently , the set @xmath49 contains at most @xmath15 elements which are not greater than @xmath40 ) .",
    "we call such a number @xmath15 a _ @xmath45-threshold _ of the permutation @xmath38 , and the corresponding number @xmath41 we call a _ @xmath50-element _ ( see also definition  [ deee1 ] in section  [ s3 ] ) .",
    "let now assume that the permutation @xmath38 has a @xmath45-threshold .",
    "if @xmath51 is the smallest @xmath45-threshold of @xmath38 , then the bachelor using the policy will marry to the @xmath11-th girl , where @xmath11 is the smallest @xmath52-element .",
    "otherwise ( i.e. when @xmath38 has no @xmath45-thresholds ) , the bachelor will marry to the @xmath2-th girl .",
    "in particular , the set @xmath53 of all lucky permutations corresponding to the sequence @xmath45 naturally splits into two subsets : the subset @xmath54 of permutations having a @xmath45-threshold and the subset @xmath55 of permutations without @xmath45-thresholds .",
    "obviously , the probability of success when using the policy is equal to the ratio @xmath56    for every @xmath44 we define the following sets : @xmath57 and the set @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the empty sequence .",
    "further , we refer to the elements of the sets @xmath60 as _ words _ and to the elements of the sets @xmath61 as _ letters_.    in theorem  [ tt1 ] ( section  [ s3 ] ) , we provide for every non - decreasing sequence @xmath62 the analytic formulae for the cardinalities of the sets @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
