    "there are important problems such as the napsack problem , the traveling salesman problem , the integer programming problem , the subgraph isomorphism problem , the satisfiability problem that have been studied for decades and for which all known algorithms have a running time that is exponential in the length of the input .",
    "these five problems and many other problems belong to the set of * np*-complete problems .",
    "any problem that can be solved in polynomial time on a nondeterministic turing machine is polynomially transformed to an * np*-complete problem @xcite .",
    "many * np*-complete problems have been identified , and it seems that such problems are very difficult and probably exponential .",
    "if so , solutions are still needed , and in this paper we consider an approach to these problems based on quantum computers and chaotic dynamics .",
    "it is widely believed that quantum computers are more efficient than classical computers .",
    "in particular shor @xcite gave a remarkable quantum polynomial - time algorithm for the factoring problem .",
    "however , it is unknown whether this problem is * np*-complete .",
    "the computational power of quantum computers has been explored in a number of papers .",
    "bernstein and vasirani @xcite proved that * * bpp**@xmath0**bqp**@xmath1 * pspace*. here * bpp * stands for the class of problems efficiently solvable in the classical sense , i.e. , the class of problems that can be solved in polynomial time by probabilistic turing machines with error probability bounded by 1/3 for all inputs . the quantum analogue of the class * bpp * is the class * bqp * which is the class of languages that can be solved in polynomial time by quantum turing machines with error probability bounded by 1/3 for all inputs .",
    "the question whether * * np**@xmath1*bqp , * i.e. , can quantum computers solve * np*-complete problems in polynomial time , was considered in @xcite .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random , with probability 1 , the class * np * can not be solved on a quantum turing machine in time o@xmath2 an oracle is a special subroutine call whose invocation only costs unit time .",
    "this result does not rule out the possibility that * * np**@xmath1*bqp * but it does establish that there is no black - box approach to solving * np*-complete problems in polynomial time on quantum turing machines . we would like to mention that these results are not immediately applicable to the chaotic quantum computer which we consider in this paper .",
    "for a recent discussion of computational complexity in quantum computing see @xcite .",
    "mathematical features of quantum computing and quantum information theory are summarized in @xcite . a possibility to exploit nonlinear quantum mechanics",
    "so that the class of problems * np * may be solved in polynomial time has been considered by abrams and lloyd in @xcite .",
    "it is mentioned in @xcite that such nonlinearity is purely hypotetical ; all known experiments confirm the linearity of quantum mechanics .",
    "the satisfiability problem ( sat ) , which is * np*-complete problem , has been considered in quantum computing in @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the sat problem can be solved in polynomial time by using a quantum computer under the assumption that a special superposition of two orthogonal vectors can be physically detected .",
    "the problem one has to overcome here is that the output of computations could be a very small number and one needs to amplify it to a reasonable large quantity .    in this paper",
    "we propose that chaotic dynamics plays a constructive role in computations .",
    "chaos and quantum decoherence are considered normally as the degrading effects which lead to an unwelcome increase of the error rate with the input size .",
    "however , in this paper we argue that under some circumstances chaos can play a constructive role in computer science .",
    "in particular we propose to combine quantum computer with the chaotic dynamics amplifier .",
    "we will argue , by using the consideration from @xcite , that such a chaotic quantum computer can solve the sat problem in polynomial time .",
    "as a possible specific implementation of chaotic quantum computations we discuss the recently proposed atomic quantum computer @xcite .",
    "it is proposed in @xcite to use a _ single _ atom as a quantum computer .",
    "one can implement a single qubit in atom as a one - particle electron state in the self - consistent field approximation and multi - qubit states as the corresponding multi - electron states represented by the slater determinant .",
    "a possible realization of the standard quantum gates in the atomic quantum computer by using the electron spin resonance has been discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we argue that in the atomic quantum computer one can build also _ nonlinear _",
    "quantum gates because the dynamics of the multi - electron atom in the very good approximation is described by nonlinear hartree - fock equations .",
    "the tensor product structure of states is very important for computations and the multielectron atom admits such a structure .",
    "more exactly , instead of the standard tensor product used in quantum computing we have to use the slater determinant to take into account the fermi statistics.the standard computational basis in quantum computing does not have bose or fermi symmetry . in the atomic case we have to make an appropriate modification of quantum gates to take into account fermi statistics and this leads to a new type of entanglement related with fermi statistics .",
    "such fermi or bose entanglement could be interesting also for quantum communication theory , in particular for quantum teleportation @xcite .",
    "let @xmath3 be a set of boolean variables , @xmath4 or @xmath5 then the set of the boolean variables @xmath6 with or without complementation is called the set of _ literals . _ a formula , which is the product ( and ) of disjunctions ( or ) of literals is said to be in the _ product of sums _",
    "( pos ) form .",

    "satisfiable _ if there is an assignment of values to variables so that the formula has value 1 .",
    "the preceding formula is satisfiable when @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11    * definition*(sat problem ) .",
    "the satisfiability problem ( sat ) is to determine whether or not a formula in pos form is satisfiable .",
    "the following analytical formulation of sat problem is useful .",
    "we define a family of boolean polynomials @xmath12 , indexed by the following data .",
    "one @xmath13 is a set @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath12 is defined as @xmath16    we assume here the addition modulo 2 .",
    "the sat problem now is to determine whether or not there exists a value of @xmath17 such that @xmath18",
    "we will work in the @xmath19-tuple tensor product hilbert space @xmath20 @xmath21**c**@xmath22 with the computational basis @xmath23 where @xmath24 @xmath25 or @xmath5 we denote @xmath26 the quantum version of the function @xmath27 is given by the unitary operator @xmath28 we assume that the unitary matrix @xmath29 can be build in the polynomial time , see @xcite .",
    "now let us use the usual quantum algorithm :    \\(i ) by using the fourier transform produce from @xmath30 the superposition @xmath31",
    "\\(ii ) use the unitary matrix @xmath29 to calculate @xmath32@xmath33 now if we measure the last qubit , i.e. , apply the projector @xmath34 to the state @xmath35 then we obtain that the probability to find the result @xmath36 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of roots of the equation @xmath39 for small @xmath40 the probability is very small and this means we in fact do nt get an information about the existence of the solution of the equation @xmath41 let us simplify our notations . after the step ( ii )",
    "the quantum computer will be in the state @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are normalized @xmath45 qubit states and @xmath46 effectively our problem is reduced to the following @xmath47 qubit problem .",
    "we have the state @xmath48 and we want to distinguish between the cases @xmath49 ( i.e. very small @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 . to this end",
    "we propose to employ chaotic dynamics .",
    "various aspects of classical and quantum chaos have been the subject of numerious studies , see @xcite and ref s therein.the investigation of quantum chaos by using quantum computers has been proposed in @xcite . here",
    "we will argue that chaos can play a constructive role in computations .",
    "chaotic behaviour in a classical system usually is considered as an exponential sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "it is this sensitivity we would like to use to distinquish between the cases @xmath49 and @xmath51 from the previous section .",
    "consider the so called logistic map which is given by the equation @xmath52 .\\ ] ]    the properties of the map depend on the parameter @xmath53 if we take , for example , @xmath54 then the lyapunov exponent is positive , the trajectory is very sensitive to the initial value and one has the chaotic behaviour @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that if the initial value @xmath55 then @xmath56 for all @xmath57        it is known @xcite that any classical algorithm can be implemented on quantum computer .",
    "our stochastic quantum computer will be consisting from two blocks .",
    "one block is the ordinary quantum computer performing computations with the output @xmath58 .",
    "the second block is a _",
    "computer performing computations of the _ classical _ logistic map .",
    "this two blocks should be connected in such a way that the state @xmath59 first be transformed into the density matrix of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are projectors to the states @xmath63 and @xmath64 this connection is in fact nontrivial and actually it should be considered as the third block .",
    "one has to notice that @xmath61 and @xmath62 generate an abelian algebra which can be considered as a classical system . in the second block the density matrix @xmath65 above",
    "is interpreted as the initial data @xmath66 for the logistic map @xmath67 after one step , the state @xmath68 becomes @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the identity matrix on @xmath71 in paricular , if one has @xmath72 then @xmath73 and we obtain @xmath74 for all @xmath57 otherwise the stochastic dynamics leads to the amplification of the small magnitude @xmath50 in such a way that it can be detected . as is seen in fig.1 , we can easily amplify the small @xmath50 in several steps , i.e. , within about ten times measurements as in shor s algorithm .",
    "the transition from @xmath75 to @xmath76 is nonlinear and can be considered as a discrete heisenberg evolution of the variable @xmath77 .",
    "one can think about various possible implementations of the idea of using chaotic dynamics for computations .",
    "below we discuss how one can realize nonlinear quantum gates on atomic quantum computer .",
    "many current proposals for the realization of quantum computer such as nmr , quantum dots and trapped ions are based on the using of an atom or an ion as one qubit , see @xcite . in these proposals",
    "a quantum computer consists from several atoms , and the coupling between them provides the coupling between qubits necessary for a quantum gate .",
    "it was proposed in @xcite that a _ single _ atom can be used as a quantum computer .",
    "one can implement a single qubit in atom as a one - particle electron state in the self - consistent field approximation and multi - qubit states as the corresponding multi - electron states represented by the slater determinant .",
    "so , to represent 10 qubits one can use an atom with 10 electrons and to represent 50 qubits one has to control only around 50 levels in an atom with 50 electrons .    a possible realization of the standard quantum gates in the atomic quantum computer by using the electron spin resonance has been discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose that in the atomic quantum computer one can build also _ nonlinear _",
    "quantum gates because the dynamics of the multi - electron atom in the very good approximation is described by nonlinear hartree - fock equations .",
    "therefore it follows from @xcite and the considerations in this paper that the atomic quantum computer can solve the sat problem in polynomial time .",
    "it is well known that in atomic physics the concept of the individual state of an electron in an atom is accepted and one proceeds from the hartree - fock self - consistent field approximation , see for example @xcite .",
    "the state of an atom is determined by the set of the states of the electrons .",
    "each state of the electron is characterized by a definite value of its orbital angular momentum @xmath78 , by the principal quantum number @xmath45 and by the values of the projections of the orbital angular momentum @xmath79 and of the spin @xmath80 on the @xmath81-axis . in the hartree - fock central field approximation the energy of an atom is completely determined by the assignment of the electron configuration , i.e. , by the assignment of the values of @xmath45 and @xmath78 for all the electrons .",
    "the tensor product structure of states is very important for computations .",
    "fortunately a multielectron atom admits such a structure .",
    "more exactly , instead of the standard tensor product used in quantum computing we have to use the slater determinant to take into account the fermi statistics.the standard computational basis in quantum computing does not have bose or fermi symmetry . in the atomic case",
    "we have to make an appropriate modification of quantum gates to take into account fermi statistics and this leads to a new type of entanglement related with fermi statistics .",
    "an application of the electron spin resonance ( esr ) to process the information encoded in the hyperfine splitting of atomic energy levels and to build standard linear quantum gates has been considered in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we suggest that in atomic quantum computer one can build also _ nonlinear _",
    "quantum gates described by the hartree - fock equations .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath82 particle system has the form @xmath83 in the hartree - fock method one takes the @xmath82 particle wave function in the form of the slater determinant @xmath84 here the one - particle wave functions @xmath85 satisfy the nonlinear hartree - fock equations which have the form of nonlinear schrodinger equation @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88    @xmath89    if we consider only the spin dependent part of the wave function of the one - electron state @xmath90 then one can get the nonlinear equation of the form @xmath91 here @xmath92 is a @xmath93 matrix and the matrix @xmath94 depends on @xmath95 by using this equation one can describe nonlinear quantum gate .",
    "the nonlinearity can be tuned by means of magnetic field .",
    "the complexity of the quantum algprithm for the sat problem has been considered in @xcite where it was shown that one can build the unitary matrix @xmath29 in the polynomial time .",
    "we have also to consider the number of steps in the classical algorithm for the logistic map performed on quantum computer .",
    "it is the probabilistic part of the construction and one has to repeat computations several times to be able to distingish the cases @xmath72 and @xmath96 thus it seems that the chaotic quantum computer can solve the sat problem in polynominal time .    in conclusion , in this paper",
    "the chaotic quantum computer is proposed .",
    "it combines the ordinary quantum computer with quantum chaotic dynamics amplifier which can be implemented by using the atomic quantum computer .",
    "we argued that such a device can be powerful enough to solve the * np*-complete problem in polynomial time ."
