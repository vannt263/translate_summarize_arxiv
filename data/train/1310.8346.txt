    "the comparison of the experimental data to the local model therefore , on the on hand , confirms the local nature of the 3@xmath5 , 3@xmath6 and 3@xmath7 orbital excitations ; on the other hand it raises a question about the dispersive nature of the 3@xmath9 excitation , which is the central focus of the paper .",
    "it is demonstrated in figure 3(d ) in the main text that the asymmetric and broad 3@xmath9 experimental lineshape is perfectly accounted for by the orbiton spectral function calculated using equation ( 1 ) and shown in figure 3(b ) ( both referring to the main text ; cf .",

    "as mentioned in the main text of the paper the dominant orbital superexchange processes for the 3@xmath9 orbital excitation are along the leg direction @xmath32 and follow from the relatively large hopping between the 3@xmath9 orbital and the neighboring oxygen 2@xmath42 orbital , [ cf .",

    "next , we look at the possible superexchange processes along the rung direction @xmath67 of the ladder , cf . figures s2(a ) and s2(c ) .",
    "it occurs that @xmath68 because the hopping element from the copper 3@xmath9 orbital to the weakly hybdridizing oxygen 2@xmath48 orbital along the rung direction @xmath67 is non zero only due to the buckling of the ladders but nevertheless it is negligible ( it is of the order of @xmath69 ev in our fplo calculations ) .    as mentioned in the main text the 90@xmath29 cu - o - cu angle between the ladders leads to very weak and frustrated interladder spin superexchange which can be neglected .",
    "_ a prori _ , also the orbital superexchange should not be affected by the presence of the neighboring ladder . while this is indeed true in the ionic picture , this changes if we take into account strong covalency effects present in cacu@xmath0o@xmath1  ( note that : ( i ) quantum chemical calculations @xcite show that cacu@xmath0o@xmath1   is even more covalent than sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1   for which it was already reported that covalency effects played a huge role in e.g. its magnetic properties @xcite , and ( ii ) e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that in the ground state there are as many holes on the oxygen as on the copper . )",
    "thus the strong hybridization between the neighboring ladders ( @xmath70 ev ) leads to a finite number of holes to be located in the 2@xmath71 orbital on oxygen and this renormalizes the superexchange @xmath72 due to the stronger coulomb repulsion on oxygen ( @xmath73 ) when this hole is present . in our qualitative model for the 3@xmath9 orbital ,",
    "however , we can skip this interaction ; instead a similar interladder covalency effect will become crucial for the analysis of the 3@xmath5 orbital excitation .    altogether , combining the orbital superexchange interaction derived above with the well - known result for the spin superexchange interaction in the buckled ladder cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 , we obtain the following hamiltonian which jointly describes the spin and orbital superexchange @xmath74 i.e. equation ( 1 ) in the main text of the paper . throughout the paper",
    "we assume the values of the spin superexchange following ref .",
    "@xcite which gives @xmath75 ev , and @xmath76 ev and agrees well with experimental considerations from ref .",
    "let us also stress that both the experimental value of @xmath77 mev as decuced from our rixs experiment as well as the spin superexchange as calculated using the hopping elements from our fplo calculations and used to obtain the values of the orbital superexchange agrees within 15% accuracy with this commonly accepted value of @xmath78 .",
    "note that the notation for the orbital superexchange ( explained in the main text of the paper ) is different than the notation for the spin superexchange as the above spin - orbital model is written in the ` @xmath11-@xmath12 ' model representation @xcite which is very convenient for studying orbiton propagation .",
    "we now turn our attention to the possible propagation of the 3@xmath5 orbital excitation .",
    "a similar analysis as above _ at first sight _ leads to two finite paths for orbital superexchange : along the ladder rung and leg , cf .",
    "figures s2(b ) and s2(c ) .",
    "this is because from the 3@xmath5 orbital the hole can hop along both the @xmath32 and @xmath67 direction , despite the buckling of the ladder .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath79 where @xmath80 ev is the hopping element between cu @xmath5 and o @xmath71 orbital and @xmath81 takes care of the multiplet structure ( see sec .",
    "c ) where @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 $ ] , and @xmath85 $ ] .    however , the hybridization with the neighboring ladder ( @xmath70 ev ) , as discussed in the main text , is not negligible [ cf .",
    "this is because the presence of holes in the oxygen 2@xmath71 state cause the _ blocking _ of the superexchange processes along the leg for the 3@xmath5 orbital : if the hole occupying this orbital has its spin pointing in the same direction as the hole in the 3@xmath5 orbital ( and due to frustration in spin interaction between the ladders @xcite , there is 50% probability for this situation ) , then the superexchange for 3@xmath5 orbital is prohibited [ cf .",
    "s2(b ) ] . in this way",
    "the @xmath86 orbital superexchange along the leg for the 3@xmath5 orbital can not lead to coherent motion of the orbiton along the ladder leg . in general , this shows another peculiar interplay between neighboring ladders which , also in many other circumstances , should not be considered as decoupled  @xcite .    on the other hand , the orbital superexchange along the rung is not affected by the above processes [ cf .",
    "s2(b ) ] and is equal to @xmath87   r_{xy}}{u ( \\delta_\\sigma+v_{dp})(\\delta_\\pi+v_{dp } ) } \\simeq 0.074   \\ { \\rm ev},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 ev ( @xmath89 ev ) is the hopping element between cu 3@xmath5 and o 2@xmath48 orbital ( 3@xmath4 and 2@xmath71 orbital ) , and @xmath90 ev is the hopping element between 3@xmath4 and 2@xmath42 orbital which is finite due to the buckling of the ladders .",
    "note that the minus sign in @xmath91 in the above equation follows from the different signs of the hopping elements between the 2@xmath42 orbital and the 3@xmath4 to the left / right in the rung .    adding the anisotropic spin superexchange interactions @xmath78 and @xmath92",
    ", we obtain : @xmath93 again @xmath94 , but since the 3@xmath5 orbiton can not hop along the leg now ( see above ) , it is confined along the rung direction @xmath32 and can not lead to the orbital dispersion along the leg @xmath67 direction [ cf .",
    "as discussed in the main text , in general the spin - orbital separation phenomenon seems to be very robust because : ( i ) the motion of the 3@xmath9 orbital excitation is strictly 1d , and ( ii ) spinons are much faster than orbitons ( due to @xmath95 ) which enables an easy separation of the two .",
    "the `` degree of fractionalization '' introduced in the main text allows to compare the degree of spin - orbital ( hole ) separation between different systems .",
    "such a quantity is the ratio between the correlation of a spin at r=0 with an orbital ( hole ) at r=@xmath96 , and the correlation between a spin at r=0 with an orbital ( hole ) at r=1 .",
    "if spin and orbital ( hole ) are fractionalized ( separated ) perfectly , then they are unperceiving to each other .",
    "thus , the existence probability for a spin at r=0 is constant and independent from an orbital ( hole ) at a position between r = 1:@xmath96 .",
    "the `` degree of fractionalization '' should be therefore 1 in this case . when spin and orbital ( hole ) are bounded or mixed for some reason , the correlation instead has a maximum value at r=1 in the t - j model . as a result",
    ", the ratio is reduced from 1 , which means that the `` degree of fractionalization '' is weakened .    in this work",
    ", we performed finite - size - scaling analysis of the spin - orbital ( hole ) correlation to estimate its value at infinite distance .",
    "the results are represented in fig .",
    "4 of the main text for the spin - orbital ( hole ) separation in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1   and cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 . for 2d systems , the degree of fractionalization",
    "is estimated to be zero since the correlation decays algebraically towards zero at infinite distance .",
    "it occurs , firstly , that the spin - orbital separation in the buckled ladder cacu@xmath0o@xmath1   is almost as strong as the spin - orbital separation in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1   and the difference between them almost entirely stems from the weaker spin superexchange along the ladder leg in cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 , cf .",
    "fig . 4 in the main text .",
    "this striking similarity between these two cases originates from the 1d ( ` directional ' ) nature of the hopping of orbitals ( cf .",
    "s2 and fig . 1 from the main text )",
    ": had the hopping from the excited orbital been less anisotropic ( e.g. 2d ) , the spin - orbital fractionalization would have been more or less destroyed ( cf .",
    "the lack of spin - charge fractionalization in the isotropic ladder or 2d cases ) . secondly , _ despite _ the weak interladder spin interactions , the degree of spin - orbital separation in cacu@xmath0o@xmath1   is much _ larger _ than the degree of fractionalization of the spin and charge in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , cf .",
    "fig . 4 in the main text .",
    "this happens because the ratio of the velocities of spinon and orbiton / holon is entirely different in these two cases : in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1   spinon is slower than holon ( @xmath97 in a typical @xmath11@xmath12 model describing spin - charge separation @xcite ) , while in cacu@xmath0o@xmath1   spinon is faster than orbiton [ cf .",
    "@xmath95 in eq .",
    "( s3 ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ] . therefore , the spinon can move away much quicker from the orbiton than from the holon , i.e. from the quasiparticle at which we look in the experiment allowing to verify the degree of separation from the spinon .",
    "finally , let us here comment on the question whether this generic ` robustness ' of the spin - orbital separation with respect to spin - charge separation might mean that the latter can not be seen in cacu@xmath0o@xmath1   ( as stated above , so far it has not been observed experimentally ) . here , we suggest , that the answer depends on the values of the effective hopping parameters in cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 : while according to @xcite the only other ( than the leg direction ) non - negligible hopping is the rung hopping @xmath11 which is three times smaller than the leg hopping and allows for a degree of fractionalization substantial enough to be observed ( it is ca .",
    "10% smaller than in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 ) , we can not exclude that in reality other long - range hoppings are still large enough to destroy the fractionalization .",
    "this is because , the hopping from the 3@xmath4 is not ` directional ' and the ratio of @xmath98 is low , leading to a weak fractionalization regime already in the case of spin - charge separation in sr@xmath0cuo@xmath1 ."
