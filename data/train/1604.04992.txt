    "the time - domain representation and the frequency - domain representation are two classical representations of a signal . in both domains , the time ( @xmath0 ) and frequency ( @xmath1 ) variables are mutually exclusive .",
    "the time - frequency distribution ( tfd ) on the other hand , provides localized signal information in time and frequency domain .",
    "the tfd provides insight into the complex structure of a signal consisting of several components .",
    "there exist many types of time - frequency analysis methods such as short - time fourier transform , gabor transform , wavelet transforms , and wigner - ville distribution .",
    "the carson and fry ( 1937 ) introduced  @xcite the concept of variable frequency , with application to the theory of frequency modulation ( fm ) , as a generalization of the definition of constant frequency .",
    "moreover , the nonstationary nature of the signals and nonlinear systems require the idea of instantaneous frequency ( if ) .",
    "the if is the basis of the tfd or time - frequency - energy ( tfe ) analysis of a signal .",
    "the if is a practically important parameter of a signal which can reveal the underlying process and provides explanations for physical phenomenon in many applications such as vibration , acoustic , speech signal analysis  @xcite , meteorological and atmospheric applications  @xcite , seismic  @xcite , radar , sonar , solar physics , structural engineering , communications , health monitoring , biomedical and medical applications  @xcite , cosmological gravity wave and financial market data analysis .",
    "the if is the time derivative of the instantaneous phase that is obtained by the gabor s complex signal , which is well - known as the analytic signal , representation  @xcite .",
    "the if is well - defined only when time derivative of phase is positive , if this derivative is negative then if does not provide any physical significance  @xcite . in order to remove this problem , recently many nonlinear and nonstationary signal representation , decomposition and analysis methods , e.g. empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) algorithms  @xcite , synchrosqueezed wavelet transforms ( sswt )  @xcite , variational mode decomposition ( vmd )  @xcite , eigenvalue decomposition ( evd )",
    "@xcite and fourier decomposition methods ( fdm )  @xcite , are proposed .",
    "the main objective of all these methods is to obtain the representation or decomposition of a signal such that the if is positive for all time .",
    "recently , singh  @xcite has obtained an important enhancement in the definition of the if where it is redefined in such that it is valid for all types of signals such as monocomponent and multicomponent , narrowband and wideband , stationary and nonstationary , linear and nonlinear signals .",
    "this has been obtained by redefining the if such that it is always positive by using the fact that inverse tangent is a _ multivalued _ ( i.e. one - to - many mapping ) function .",
    "thus , this definition of if has provided a way to obtain tfd of a signal by decomposing into a set of desired frequency bands .    as is well - known that the fourier theory , which maps a time - domain signal into the frequency - domain signal , is the only tool for spectrum analysis of a signal .",
    "the fdm  @xcite has demonstrated that it is also a superior tool for nonlinear and nonstationary time series analysis . in this study , we demonstrate that the time information , which we refer to as ` frequentaneous time ' as a dual of the ` instantaneous frequency ' , can be recovered from the frequency derivative of phase of frequency domain signal .",
    "so obtained frequentaneous time @xmath2 , frequency @xmath1 and fourier domain signal @xmath3 are used to obtain the three dimensional time - frequency distribution of a signal .",
    "the fourier series is a well - known and most important representation of a periodic function in the mathematics , science and engineering for spectral analysis of a physical phenomena .",

    "thus , real and imaginary part are always orthogonal , i.e. @xmath14 because multiplication of even and odd function is odd function and integration of odd function in a limit @xmath15 $ ] is always zero .    as @xmath4 $ ] is a real - valued function , from we",
