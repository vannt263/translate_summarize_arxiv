    "the voter model ( vm )  @xcite is one of the simplest and most influential examples of individual - based systems exhibiting collective behavior .",
    "the vm has been used as a paradigm for the dynamics of opinion in socially interacting populations , see _ e.g. _  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the classical , or linear , vm is closely related to the ising model  @xcite and describes how consensus results from the interactions between neighboring agents endowed with a discrete set of states ( `` opinions '' ) .",
    "while the vm is one of the rare exactly solvable models in non - equilibrium statistical physics , it relies on oversimplified assumptions such as perfect conformity and lack of self - confidence of all voters .",
    "this is clearly unrealistic as it is recognized that members of a society respond differently to stimuli : many exhibit conformity while some show independence , and this influences the underlying social dynamics  @xcite . in order to mimic the dynamics of socially interacting agents with different levels of confidence ,",
    "this author introduced `` zealots '' in the vm  @xcite .",
    "originally zealots were agents favoring one opinion  @xcite .",
    "the case of inflexible zealots whose state never changes was then also studied  @xcite , and the influence of committed and/or independent individuals was considered in various models of opinion and social dynamics  @xcite .",
    "recently , authors have investigated the effect of zealots in naming and cooperation games , and even in theoretical ecology  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", many versions of the vm have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting variant of the vm is the two - state nonlinear @xmath0-voter model ( @xmath0vm ) introduced in @xcite . in this model",
    "@xmath0 randomly picked neighbors may influence a voter to change its opinion .",
    "when @xmath2 , the _ q_vm is closely related to the sznajd model  @xcite and to that of ref .",
    "the properties of the @xmath0vm have received much attention and there is a debate on the expression of the exit probability in one dimension  @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate a generalization of the nonlinear @xmath0vm , with @xmath1 , in which a well - mixed population consists of inflexible zealots and susceptible voters influenced by their neighbors . as a motivation",
    ", this parsimonious model allows to capture three important concepts of social psychology  @xcite and sociology  @xcite : ( i ) conformity / imitation is an important social mechanism for collective actions ; ( ii ) group pressure is known to influence the degree of conformity , especially when a group size threshold is reached  @xcite ; ( iii ) the degree of conformity can be radically altered by the presence of some individuals that are capable of resisting group pressure  @xcite . here",
    ", the @xmath0vm mimics the process of conformity by imitation with group - size threshold , whereas zealots are independent agents that resist social pressure and can thus prevent to reach unanimity .    in this work ,",
    "we study the fluctuation - driven dynamics of the two - state @xmath0vm with zealots in finite well - mixed populations and shed light on the deviations from the mean field description and from the linear case ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we find that below a zealotry density threshold the probability distribution is bimodal instead of gaussian and , after a characteristic time , most susceptibles become supporters of the party having more zealots . when both parties have the same small number of zealots , susceptibles endlessly swing from the state where they all support one party to the other with a mean switching time that approximately grows exponentially with the population size .    in the next section",
    "we introduce the model .",
    "sections iii and iv are dedicated to the mean field description and to the model s stationary probability distribution . in secs .",

    "we consider a population of @xmath4 voters that can support one of two parties , either a or b , and therefore be in two states .",
    "supporters of party a are in state @xmath5 , and those supporting party b are in state @xmath6 . among the voters , a fixed number of them are `` inflexible zealots '' while the others are `` susceptibles '' . here , zealots are individuals that never change opinion : they permanently support either party a ( a - zealots ) or party b ( b - zealots ) .",
    "susceptible voters can change their opinion under the pressure of a group of neighbors .",
    "the population thus consists of a number @xmath7 of a - zealots ( pinned in state @xmath5 ) and @xmath8 of b - zealots ( pinned in state @xmath6 ) , and a total of @xmath9 susceptibles agents , of which @xmath10 are a - susceptibles ( non - zealot voters in state @xmath5 ) and @xmath11 are b - susceptibles ( non - zealot voters in state @xmath6 ) .",
    "the fraction , or density , of susceptibles in the entire population remains constant and is given by @xmath12 .",
    "for simplicity we assume that all agents have the same persuasion strength .    at each time step",
    ", a susceptible voter consults a group of @xmath0 neighbors ( with @xmath13 ) and , if there is consensus in the group , the voter is persuaded to adopt the group s state with rate @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is a generalization of the nonlinear @xmath0vm  @xcite with a finite density of zealots  @xcite , and consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "pick a random voter . if this voter is a zealot nothing happens .",
    "if the picked voter is a susceptible , then pick a group of @xmath0 neighbors ( for the sake of simplicity repetition is allowed , as in refs .",
    "if all @xmath0 neighbors are in the same state , the selected voter also adopts that state .",
    "nothing happens in the update if there is no consensus among the @xmath0 neighbors  @xcite , or if the voter and its @xmath0 neighbors are already in the same state .",
    "3 .   repeat the above steps _ ad infinitum _ or until consensus is reached .",
    "the case @xmath3 corresponds to the classical ( linear ) voter model  @xcite , and we therefore focus on @xmath1 .    for the sake of simplicity , we investigate this model on a complete graph ( well - mixed population of size @xmath4 ) .",
