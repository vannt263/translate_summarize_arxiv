    "the statistical mechanics of systems with long - range interactions is currently a topic of active research @xcite . among long - range interactions ,",
    "the gravitational force plays a fundamental role .",
    "therefore , the developement of a statistical mechanics for self - gravitating systems is of considerable interest @xcite . in this context",
    ", a system of self - gravitating fermions enclosed within a box provides an interesting model which can be studied in great detail @xcite .",
    "this model incorporates an effective small - scale cut - off played by the pauli exclusion principle and a large scale cut - off played by the confining box ( other forms of confinement could also be considered ) .",
    "the statistical mechanics of this system is rigorously justified and presents a lot of interesting features which are of interest in statistical mechanics @xcite and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "its detailed study is therefore important at a conceptual and practical level .    in a preceding paper @xcite ,",
    "we have discussed the nature of phase transitions in the self - gravitating fermi gas in a space of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "our study was performed in both microcanonical and canonical ensembles and considered an arbitrary degree of degeneracy relative to the system size .",
    "this study completes previous investigations by hertel & thirring @xcite who worked in the canonical ensemble and considered small system sizes . at high temperatures and high energies ,",
    "the system is in a gaseous phase and quantum effects are completely negligible . at some transition temperature @xmath3 or transition energy @xmath4 ( for sufficiently large system sizes ) ,",
    "a first order phase transition is expected to occur and drive the system towards a condensed phase .",
    "however , gaseous states are still metastable below this transition point and gravitational collapse will rather occur at a smaller critical temperature @xmath5 ( jeans temperature ) @xcite or critical energy @xmath6 ( antonov energy ) @xcite at which the metastable branch disappears ( spinodal point ) .",
    "the end - state of the collapse is a compact object with a `` core - halo '' structure .",
    "typically , it consists of a degenerate nucleus surrounded by a `` vapour '' .",
    "the nucleus ( condensate ) resembles a white dwarf star @xcite . at non - zero temperature ,",
    "this compact object is surrounded by a dilute atmosphere .",
    "therefore , when quantum mechanics is properly accounted for , there exists an equilibrium state ( global maximum of entropy or free energy ) for each value of accessible energy and temperature .",
    "the condensate results from the balance between gravitational contraction and quantum pressure . as first noticed by fowler @xcite in his classical theory of white dwarf stars , quantum mechanics is able to stabilize matter against gravitational collapse .",
    "one object of this paper is to show that this conclusion is no more valid in a space of dimension @xmath1 . for a system of mass @xmath7 enclosed within a box of radius @xmath8",
    ", there exists a critical temperature ( for sufficiently large @xmath8 ) and a critical energy below which the system can not be found at statistical equilibrium .",
    "this is like the antonov instability for self - gravitating classical particles in @xmath2 @xcite but it now occurs for fermions . therefore ,",
    "quantum mechanics can not arrest gravitational collapse in @xmath1 .",
    "this result is connected to our previous observation @xcite that a classical white dwarf star ( a polytrope of index @xmath9 ) becomes unstable for @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , this result is similar to that of ehrenfest @xcite who considered the stability of atomic structures ( in bohr s model ) for different dimensions of space and concludes that @xmath11 is required for stability . in this paper",
    ", we determine the caloric curve of the self - gravitating fermi gas for an arbitrary dimension of space and an arbitrary degree of degeneracy ( or system size ) .",
    "we exhibit particular dimensions that play a special role in the problem .",
    "the dimension @xmath12 is critical because the results established for @xmath13 can not be directly extended to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xmath12 the radius of a white dwarf star is independent on its mass and given in terms of fundamental constants by @xmath14 .",
    "the dimension @xmath15 is also critical because it is the dimension at which classical white dwarf stars become unstable . at this particular dimension ,",
    "their mass is independent on radius and can be expressed in terms of fundamental constants as @xmath16 .",
    "mathematically , this is similar to chandrasekhar s limiting mass @xcite for relativistic white dwarf stars in @xmath2 .",
    "the dimension @xmath17 is also particular because at this dimension , the white dwarf stars cease to be self - confined and have infinite mass .",
    "finally , @xmath18 is the dimension at which the caloric curve of classical isothermal spheres loses its characteristic spiral nature @xcite . although we systematically explore all dimensions of space in order to have a complete picture of the problem , only dimensions @xmath19 , @xmath12 and @xmath2 are _ a priori _ of physical interest .",
    "the dimension @xmath19 is considered in cosmology and in connexion with shell models , and the dimension @xmath12 can be useful to describe filaments or ring structures with high aspect ratio .",
    "two - dimensional gravity is also of interest for its properties of conformal invariance and for its relation with two - dimensional turbulence @xcite .",
    "non - integer dimensions can arise if the system has a fractal nature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_fermions ] , we determine the thermodynamical parameters of the self - gravitating fermi gas in dimension @xmath0 . the fermi - dirac entropy is introduced from a combinatorial analysis . in sec .",
    "[ sec_lim ] , we consider asymptotic limits corresponding to the classical self - gravitating gas and to completely degenerate structures ( white dwarfs ) .",
    "we emphasize the importance of metastable states in astrophysics and explain how they can be taken into account in the theory ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "we also discuss the thermodynamic limit of the self - gravitating quantum gas and compare it with the thermodynamic limit of the self - gravitating classical gas in the dilute limit @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec_caloric ] , we provide a gallery of caloric curves of the self - gravitating fermi gas in different dimensions of space .",
    "rigorous mathematical results on the existence of solutions of the fermi - poisson equation have been obtained by staczy @xcite .",
    "finally , in the conclusion , we place our study in a more general perspective .",
    "we give a short historical account of scientific and philosophical papers who studied the role played by the dimension of space in determining the form of the laws of physics .",
    "these works tend to indicate that the dimension @xmath2 of our universe is very particular .",
    "this is also the result that we reach in our study .",
    "these remarks can have implications regarding the anthropic principle .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath20 fermions interacting via newtonian gravity in a space of dimension @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that the mass of the configuration is sufficiently small so as to ignore relativistic effects .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the distribution function of the system , i.e. @xmath22 gives the mass of particles whose position and velocity are in the cell @xmath23 at time @xmath24 .",
    "the integral of @xmath25 over the velocity determines the spatial density @xmath26 and the total mass of the configuration is given by @xmath27 where the integral extends over the entire domain .",
    "on the other hand , in the meanfield approximation , the total energy of the system can be expressed as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the kinetic energy and @xmath30 the potential energy .",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath31 is related to the density by the newton - poisson equation @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the surface of a unit sphere in a space of dimension @xmath0 and @xmath34 is the constant of gravity ( which depends on the dimension of space ) .",
    "we now wish to determine the most probable distribution of self - gravitating fermions at statistical equilibrium . to that purpose",
    ", we divide the individual phase space @xmath35 into a very large number of microcells with size @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the planck constant ( the mass @xmath38 of the particles arises because we use @xmath39 instead of @xmath40 as a phase space coordinate ) .",
    "a microcell is occupied either by @xmath41 or @xmath42 fermion ( or @xmath43 fermions if we account for the spin ) .",
    "we shall now group these microcells into macrocells each of which contains many microcells but remains nevertheless small compared to the phase - space extension of the whole system .",
    "we call @xmath44 the number of microcells in a macrocell",
    ". consider the configuration @xmath45 where there are @xmath46 fermions in the @xmath47 macrocell , @xmath48 in the @xmath49 macrocell etc ... , each occupying one of the @xmath44 microcells with no cohabitation .",
    "the number of ways of assigning a microcell to the first element of a macrocell is @xmath44 , to the second @xmath50 etc .",
    "since the particles are indistinguishable , the number of ways of assigning microcells to all @xmath51 particles in a macrocell is thus @xmath52 to obtain the number of microstates corresponding to the macrostate @xmath45 defined by the number of fermions @xmath51 in each macrocell ( irrespective of their precise position in the cell ) , we need to take the product of terms such as ( [ fd5 ] ) over all macrocells .",
    "thus , the number of microstates corresponding to the macrostate @xmath45 , i.e. the probability of the state @xmath45 , is @xmath53 this is the fermi - dirac statistics . as is customary ,",
    "we define the entropy of the state @xmath45 by @xmath54 it is convenient here to return to a representation in terms of the distribution function giving the phase - space density in the @xmath55-th macrocell @xmath56 where we have defined @xmath57 , which represents the maximum value of @xmath25 due to pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "now , using the stirling formula , we have @xmath58 passing to the continuum limit @xmath59 , we obtain the usual expression of the fermi - dirac entropy @xmath60 if we take into account the spin of the particles , the above expression remains valid but the maximum value of the distribution function is now @xmath61 , where @xmath43 is the spin multiplicity of the quantum states ( the phase space element has also to be multiplied by @xmath62 ) .",
    "an expression of entropy similar to ( [ fd10 ] ) , but arising for a completely different reason , has been introduced by lynden - bell in the context of the violent relaxation of collisionless stellar systems @xcite . in that context",
    ", @xmath63 represents the maximum value of the initial distribution function and the actual distribution function ( coarse - grained ) must always satisfy @xmath64 by virtue of the liouville theorem .",
    "this is the origin of the `` effective '' exclusion principle in lynden - bell s theory , which has nothing to do with quantum mechanics .",
    "since the particles ( stars ) are distinguishable classical objects ( but subject to an exclusion principle in the collisionless regime ) , lynden - bell s statistics corresponds to a @xmath65-th form of statistics ( in addition to the maxwell - boltzmann , fermi - dirac and bose - einstein statistics ) .",
    "however , for a single type of phase element @xmath63 , it leads to the same results as the fermi - dirac statistics .",
    "we also recall that in the non - degenerate ( or classical ) limit @xmath66 , the fermi - dirac entropy ( [ fd10 ] ) reduces to the boltzmann entropy @xmath67    now that the entropy has been precisely justified , the statistical equilibrium state ( most probable state ) of self - gravitating fermions is obtained by maximizing the fermi - dirac entropy ( [ fd10 ] ) at fixed mass ( [ fd2 ] ) and energy ( [ fd3 ] ) : @xmath68\\quad | \\quad e[f]=e , m[f]=m . \\label{fd12}\\ ] ] introducing lagrange multipliers @xmath69 ( inverse temperature ) and @xmath70 ( chemical potential ) to satisfy these constraints , and writing the variational principle in the form @xmath71 we find that the _ critical points _ of entropy correspond to the fermi - dirac distribution @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a strictly positive constant ( inverse fugacity ) and @xmath74 is the inverse temperature .",
    "clearly , the distribution function satisfies @xmath75 , which is a consequence of pauli s exclusion principle .",
    "so far , we have assumed that the system is isolated so that the energy is conserved .",
    "if now the system is in contact with a thermal bath ( e.g. , a radiation background ) fixing the temperature , the statistical equilibrium state minimizes the free energy @xmath76 , or maximizes the massieu function @xmath77 , at fixed mass and temperature : @xmath78\\quad |\\quad m[f]=m . \\label{fd15}\\ ] ] introducing lagrange multipliers and writing the variational principle in the form @xmath79 we find that the _ critical points _ of free energy are again given by the fermi - dirac distribution ( [ fd14 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the critical points ( first variations ) of the variational problems ( [ fd12 ] ) and ( [ fd15 ] ) are the same .",
    "however , the stability of the system ( regarding the second variations ) can be different in microcanonical and canonical ensembles .",
    "when this happens , we speak of a situation of _ ensemble inequivalence _ @xcite .",
    "the stability of the system can be determined by a graphical construction , by simply plotting the caloric curve / series of equilibria @xmath80 and using the turning point method of katz @xcite .      integrating the distribution function ( [ fd14 ] ) over velocity",
    ", we find that the density of particles is related to the gravitational potential by @xmath81 where @xmath82 denotes the fermi integral @xmath83 we recall the identity @xmath84 which can be established from ( [ p2 ] ) by an integration by parts . the gravitational potential is now obtained by substituting eq .",

    "we introduce the rescaled distance @xmath85 and the variables @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the central potential .",
    "thus , we get the @xmath0-dimensional fermi - poisson equation @xmath89 @xmath90    as is well - known , self - gravitating systems at non - zero temperature have the tendency to evaporate .",
    "therefore , there is no equilibrium state in a strict sense and the statistical mechanics of self - gravitating systems is essentially an out - of - equilibrium problem .",
    "however , the evaporation rate is small in general and the system can be found in a quasi - equilibrium state for a relatively long time . in order to describe the thermodynamics of the self - gravitating fermi gas rigorously , we shall use an artifice and enclose the system within a spherical box of radius @xmath8 ( the box typically represents the size of the cluster under consideration ) . in that case , the solution of eq .",

    "relativistic effects will be considered in a forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "finally , our study can shed light on the mathematical properties of the vlasov - poisson system .",
    "indeed , there is a close connexion between collisionless stellar systems and self - gravitating fermions @xcite .",
    "for example , the fact that the vlasov equation does not blow up ( i.e. , experiences gravitational collapse ) in @xmath2 for non singular initial conditions can be related to a sort of exclusion principle , as in quantum mechanics . due to the liouville theorem in @xmath70-space ,",
    "the distribution function must remain smaller that its maximum initial value @xmath75 and this prevents complete collapse @xcite , unlike for collisional stellar systems @xcite described by the landau - poisson system . since quantum mechanics can not arrest gravitational collapse in @xmath1 ( for sufficiently low energies ) , this suggests that the vlasov - poisson system can probably blow up for @xmath1 .",
