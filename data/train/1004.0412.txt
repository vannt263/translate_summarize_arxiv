    "explaining far - from - equilibrium macroscopic phenomena on the basis of microscopic dynamical mechanisms is one of the basic problems of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "this paper presents the results of some numerical studies aimed at shedding light on `` micro - to - macro '' questions for a class of mechanical models introduced in @xcite as paradigms for transport processes . here as in @xcite , the basic idea is that macroscopic quantities such as energy and density profiles can be deduced  easily and fairly accurately  from certain information on local dynamics provided one makes a couple of simplifying assumptions . in this paper , we extend the results in @xcite to a larger class of models and at the same time examine more closely the extent to which these assumptions hold .",
    "these questions lead to a systematic study of how geometry impacts memory and finite - size effects .",
    "the models studied in this paper describe a coupled transport of matter and energy .",
    "the local dynamics are purely deterministic and energy - conserving ; that is what we mean by `` hamiltonian '' in this paper .",
    "the system is attached to ( unequal ) stochastic heat baths which both inject particles into the system and absorb those that leave .",
    "placed throughout the system , evenly spaced , are rotating disks that are nailed down at their centers ; particles exchange energy with them upon collisions .",
    "this interaction was first used in @xcite and @xcite ; it takes the place of direct particle - particle interactions , which are more delicate to control .",
    "the authors of @xcite introduced the following conceptual simplification : each rotating disk is enclosed in a well - defined area called a _ cell _ , with small enough passageways between cells to ensure equilibration within each cell . motivated by this  decoupling \" of internal cell dynamics and cell - to - cell traffic , they proposed a scheme that yields simple explicit expressions for approximate energy profiles and particle densities .",
    "the scheme is based on two assumptions : that cell - to - cell movement takes essentially the form of an unbiased random walk , and that within each cell , the system attains local thermal equilibrium quickly .",
    "they found striking agreement between their proposed formulas and simulation results , with barely visible errors for chains consisting of no more than 30 cells .",
    "the aims of this paper are twofold .",
    "one is a straightforward extension of the results in @xcite to a larger class of models . keeping the basic interaction as well as cell structure in the last paragraph",
    ", we have found the prediction scheme in @xcite  suitably modified  to be very flexible . to give a sense of the type of generalizations , our simulations are in 2d , but we expect similar results to hold in 3d ( with rotating balls in the place of rotating disks ) . in dimensions greater than one ,",
    "there are different choices of lattices and boundary conditions .",
    "we show that this scheme is equally valid for rectangular and hexagonal lattices , and for all of the boundary conditions tested .",
    "the resulting profiles are , of course , different in each case .",
    "we permit even point sources and the use of thermostats to regulate temperature in different parts of the domain . these and other features are illustrated in examples 13 in sect .",
    "we also extend the results in @xcite in a different direction , to `` closed '' systems , i.e. , systems in which the total particle number is conserved and system - bath interactions are limited to energy exchange ( sect .  4 ) .",
    "our second aim is to understand why memory and finite - size effects are so mild in the models tested , or , put differently , why a scheme that ignores these effects can perform so well in profile predictions .",
    "here we find the key to lie in _ cell geometry _ , referring roughly to the geometric relation of cell walls and passageways to the rotating disk . to examine these issues in greater depth",
    ", we consider a broader class of cell designs . among the geometries studied here ,",

    "walls between cells are broken down altogether leaving a domain with rotating disks inside . to summarize",
    ", we find that finite - size and memory effects can be significant or insignificant . by understanding the dynamical mechanisms behind them , we learn to identify  good \" and  bad \" geometries . with regard to directional bias in particle trajectories due to memory ,",

    "* stochastic idealizations .",
    "* alongside the hamiltonian models , the authors of @xcite introduced a class of markov jump processes intended to be their stochastic idealizations . our generalizations in sects",
    ".  2 and 4 apply also to these stochastic models . we have run many tests , and have found  without exception  that the simulations converge easily to predicted values ( with , not surprisingly , smaller errors and faster convergence rates than for their hamiltonian counterparts ) . while this class of stochastic models , sometimes called",
    " random - halves models \" ( see @xcite ) , are interesting in their own right , we have elected to focus on hamiltonian models in this paper because they are both more complex and more physical",

    "much more is known in the context of stochastic models or models with a significant stochastic component . of the considerable literature on that topic , we cite here a few that are most closely related to the present study :  @xcite .",
    "the literature on models with purely deterministic internal dynamics is more sparse .",
    "in addition to the articles already cited , @xcite are the main ones we know of . finally , aside from putting @xcite in the more general contexts to which it belongs ,",
    "we have taken some small steps in this paper to connect geometry and local dynamics to nonequilibrium properties , a connection that , in general , remains to be understood .",

    "3.1 show that the amount of bias here ( @xmath159 ) is relatively small .",
    "a possible explanation is that in the present setting , bias can and does lead to a net gradient in @xmath136 across the length of the chain , whereas in non - particle - conserving systems the values of @xmath136 at the two ends are fixed by the baths .",

    "agreement with simulation data is good , and lends further support to the idea that bias is a `` local '' phenomenon , governed mainly by the mean values of thermodynamic quantities and their gradients .",
    "the main findings of this paper are :    1 .   _ for a large class of hamiltonian systems , macroscopic profiles such as those for energy and particle count can be quite accurately predicted in a simple way . _",
    "the scheme introduced in @xcite and applied to 1d chains is extended here to more general settings , including 2d systems on rectangular and hexagonal lattices driven by dirichlet and other boundary conditions , even point sources .",
    "strong agreement with simulation data is also obtained for systems regulated by thermostats , and for systems in which particle numbers are held constant .",
    "memory effects resulting in directional bias of particle trajectories can vary from negligible to significant depending on cell geometry .",
