    "granular gases  @xcite , i.e. gases of particles interacting through dissipative collisions , represent an important paradigm for the study of non - equilibrium stationary states . due to the dissipative nature of the interactions , granular gases have to be considered as open systems and therefore concepts from equilibrium thermodynamics",
    "can not be applied , at least in a straightforward way . however , by analogy with molecular gases , a `` granular temperature '' @xmath2 can be defined in terms of the kinetic energy per particle . if the system is driven by an external energy input a stationary state is reached : @xmath2 fluctuates around a given value , while a flux of energy from the driving source goes into the system and is dissipated through inelastic collisions .",
    "experiments , theory and simulations have recently shown that in a mixture of different grains , as soon as the inter - particle collisions dissipate energy , the equipartition of energy among the mixture components is lost  @xcite even in the tracer limit  @xcite . although in sharp contrast with the behaviour of molecular gases at equilibrium , this violation is not surprising because in a generic open system the equipartition of energy is not expected . however , it is natural to ask whether @xmath2 could have some different `` equilibrium '' meaning , or if it is just a measure of velocity fluctuations .",
    "a hallmark of equilibrium phenomena is the well - known fluctuation dissipation theorem , relating the response of a system to a perturbation to the corresponding correlation function measured in the unperturbed system : the response of an observable @xmath3 at time @xmath4 to an impulsive perturbation @xmath5 at time @xmath6 can be obtained as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the observable conjugated to @xmath5 and @xmath9 is the equilibrium temperature of the system ( brackets denote averaging over thermal history ) .",
    "a recent investigation has shown that , for non - equilibrium monodisperse driven granular gases , this relation is still obeyed if the equilibrium temperature is replaced by the granular temperature  @xcite .",
    "a natural question then arises : what happens to the relation ( [ eq : fdt ] ) in a mixture which displays more than one granular temperature ? in this letter , we will address this question in the case of a binary mixture subject to a homogeneous driving .",
    "it turns out that each species obeys an fdt relation with its own granular temperature  @xcite as proportionality factor .",
    "this result is particularly relevant to experiments where a tracer , immersed in the granular gas and acting as a probe ( and in particular as a thermometer ) , may have different physical properties with respect to the surrounding gas  @xcite . in equilibrium measurements ,",
    "the temperature does not depend on the thermometer . for granular materials , instead",
    ", the thermometer measures its own temperature , in general different from that of the surrounding gas .",
    "we consider a volume @xmath10 containing a mixture of @xmath11 inelastic hard spheres ( ihs ) in dimension @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the number of particles in component @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the mixture , respectively .",
    "the spheres have diameters @xmath17 ( identical for the two species ) and masses @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the species index , @xmath15 or @xmath16 , of particle @xmath21 ) . in a collision between spheres @xmath21 and @xmath22 , characterized by the inelasticity parameter called coefficient of normal restitution @xmath23 , the pre - collisional velocity of particle @xmath21 , @xmath24 , is transformed into the post - collisional velocity @xmath25 such that @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the center to center unit vector from particle @xmath21 to @xmath22 ( @xmath29 so that the total linear momentum @xmath30 is conserved ) .",
    "the granular temperature of species @xmath31 is given by its mean kinetic energy @xmath32 .",
    "the loss of energy due to collisions can be compensated in various ways . in experiments",
    "the energy is typically supplied at the boundaries , leading the system to a heterogeneous stationary state  @xcite . in order to avoid the complication of strong temperature heterogeneities",
    ", we will use a homogeneous driving in the form of a `` thermostat '' : in this mechanism ( which recently has attracted the attention of many theorists  @xcite ) , the particles are submitted , between collisions , to a random force in the form of an uncorrelated white noise ( e.g. gaussian ) with the possible addition of a viscous term .",
    "the equation of motion for a particle is then @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the force due to inelastic collisions , @xmath35 is the viscosity coefficient and @xmath36 , where greek indexes refer to cartesian coordinates @xcite .    at the level of boltzmann kinetic equation",
    ", the temperature ratio of a binary granular mixture subject to stochastic driving of the form given above has been obtained in  @xcite for the case @xmath37 and in  @xcite for @xmath38 .",
    "we have used two different simulation methods : the direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc )  @xcite which neglects pre - collisional correlations and therefore enforces the molecular chaos hypothesis ( factorization of the two - particles distribution functions ) and molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "the dsmc algorithm can be used to simulate the _ homogeneous _ enskog - boltzmann equation , i.e. any particle can collide with any other in the whole volume @xmath10 , or to simulate an a priori _ non - homogeneous _",
    "system , by dividing the space into small cells ( of linear size smaller than the mean free path ) and enforcing molecular chaos in every single cell . on the other hand , molecular dynamics",
    "( md ) simulations integrate the equations of motion of the ihs : in this case we consider @xmath39 hard spheres in a square box of linear size @xmath40 , with periodic boundary conditions , random initial velocities , and we use an event - driven algorithm to study their dynamics .",
    "all the investigation methods used have shown similar results . we have used sizes @xmath41 to @xmath42 , and averaged over up to @xmath43 realizations of the dynamics .",
    "our analysis relies on two sets of independent measurements , i.e. two choices of the pair response - correlation to be measured .",
    "the first one consists in a measure of mobility and diffusivity .",
    "the mean - square displacement ( msd ) for each species , @xmath44 behaves as @xmath45 for large time differences .",
    "the mobility of a tracer particle is measured by applying a constant and small  @xcite drag force @xmath46 to a given particle , labeled @xmath47 , for times @xmath48 . due to the viscosity induced by the collisions with other particles ,",
    "the perturbed particle will reach at large times a constant velocity @xmath49 , related to the response by @xmath50 by successively using as test particle one particle of each species , one obtains the two responses @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and thus the mobilities @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "two einstein relations ( @xmath55 ) can then be checked , e.g. by plotting @xmath56 vs. @xmath57 .    another totally independent way of checking fd relations in granular gases has also been used in  @xcite : once a steady - state has been reached ,",
    "the system is perturbed impulsively at a given time @xmath58 by a non - conservative force applied ( non - uniformly ) on every particle ( we will take @xmath59 without loss of generality ) .",
    "the response is then monitored at later times .",
    "the force acting on particle @xmath21 is @xmath60 with the properties @xmath61 , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a particle dependent variable with randomly assigned @xmath64 values .",
    "a simple case is realized by a transverse perturbation @xmath65",
    "@xcite , where @xmath66 is compatible with the periodic boundary conditions , i.e. @xmath67 with @xmath68 integer and @xmath69 the linear horizontal box size . the staggered response function ( i.e. the current induced at @xmath4 by the perturbation at @xmath58 ) , and the conjugated correlation , @xmath70 \\ } \\rangle \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "are related , _ at equilibrium _",
    ", to the correlation by the fd relation @xmath71 , @xmath72 being the equilibrium temperature .    ref .",
    "@xcite has shown the validity of this relation in the context of a monodisperse granular media heated by a thermal bath with temperature @xmath73 , reaching in this way a stationary state with granular temperature @xmath74 . in this case",
    "the fd relation holds by replacing @xmath9 with @xmath2 . for a binary mixture ,",
    "two sets @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) of correlation and response are measured separately , thus obtaining two plots @xmath77 vs. @xmath78 .",
    "there are different reasons to test various pairs of response and correlation functions .",
    "first , at equilibrium fdt links any couple of conjugated correlation and response function with the _ same _ temperature . out of equilibrium",
    ", it is possible , a priori , that fdt could be valid for some observables and not for others .",
    "moreover , mean square displacement and mobility correspond to the exploration of the long time regime , while @xmath77 and @xmath78 decay quickly ( a few collisions per particle ) and therefore yield the short time behaviour .",
    "fdt could be valid in some time regimes and not in others .",
    "it must also be stressed that the measure of diffusion and mobility requires large times , so that averaging over many realizations becomes computationally very demanding and less precision is numerically available . in md simulations in particular",
    "we have measured only the relation between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "in all the simulations performed ( md and dmsc ) the values of the temperature ratios @xmath79 obtained are in good agreement with  @xcite . this is not surprising for homogeneous dsmc , while it is less obvious in md ( the agreement is mostly due to the low packing fraction @xmath80 used ) .",
    "the measures of @xmath81 and @xmath82 allow us to check the linearity with @xmath4 at large times : @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , figures  [ fig : hom_kicks ] and  [ fig : cells_kicks ] clearly show that the einstein relations are obeyed separately by the two components of the mixture , each with its own temperature : to the numerical accuracy one obtains @xmath85 .",
    "note that mobilities and diffusion coefficients of each species are different from their value in a monodisperse case .",
    "we have considered various values of inelasticities , mass ratios , number density ratios , and kinds of thermostat , obtaining that this result is robust with respect to all these variations .",
    "we also note that a recent study  @xcite has shown that the einstein relation is not valid in its usual form in the case of an impurity immersed in an homogeneously cooling granular : the main reason is that extra terms arise due to the evolution of the granular temperature with time . since we are here concerned with _ steady - states _ , these extra terms are not present in the case studied .",
    "the other source of deviations , namely the deviation from gibbs state , leads to small deviations  @xcite that could be difficult to detect  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the measure of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "technical details of the numerical procedure to perform this measure are given in  @xcite .",
    "from the definitions of @xmath88 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , it is clear that @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath91 .",
    "thus we have plotted in figure  [ fig : rc_dsmc_md ] the functions @xmath92 vs. @xmath93 .",
    "the fd relation @xmath94 is verified replacing @xmath9 by the partial granular temperature @xmath0 and @xmath1 of each component . the same result holds for different @xmath68 ( @xmath95 in order to satisfy the properties of the perturbing force  ( [ forcing ] ) ) .",
    "the md simulations ( whose results are reported in figure  [ fig : rc_dsmc_md ] ) are more realistic since they include excluded volume effects and collision - induced correlations ( which break the molecular chaos hypothesis , see for example  @xcite ) . however ,",
    "at not too high packing fractions , we still observe the same results for fd relations .",
    "larger packing fractions lead to strong heterogeneities in both density and granular temperature , giving rise to deviations from fd  @xcite .",
    "an interesting question concerns what happens to the fluctuation - dissipation ratio when measured for the whole system and not separately for the different components of the mixture .",
    "in other words one could ask whether one can define an effective temperature for the whole system and what is the relation of this temperature with the temperatures defined above for the two components of the mixture , or with the global temperature @xmath96 ( where @xmath97 ) .",
    "a global measure would give , for the mean - square displacement @xmath98 and for the response @xmath99    using the previously checked result that @xmath84 and @xmath100 , one obtains that @xmath101 and @xmath102 , with @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the einstein relation for the global case thus reads : @xmath105 it is clear that the ratio @xmath106 corresponds to the global granular temperature only when @xmath107 , i.e. when equipartition is satisfied . in figure  [ fig_einstein_global ]",
    "we present evidences supporting this view .",
    ".5 cm    another way to consider the problem is to look at the ratio between @xmath108 and @xmath109 . in this case",
    "the impossibility to define an effective temperature reflects itself in the non - constant ratio between @xmath110 and @xmath111 , as we show in figure  [ fig_fdr_gobal ] .",
    ".5 cm    it should be remarked how these properties of the global fluctuation - dissipation ratio allow us to make the following prediction .",
    "suppose to perform a global measurement of the fluctuation - dissipation ratio on a system of unknown composition .",
    "a global measurement on a monodisperse system would yield a well defined fd ratio and a well defined temperature equal to the granular temperature , independently of the observable used ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    "a polydisperse system would feature a typically non - constant fd ratio , function also of the observable ( unless the system is completely elastic ) .",
    "finally we investigate the special case @xmath112 , i.e. the case of a single tracer , immersed in a granular gas of @xmath113 different particles , acting as a non - perturbing thermometer .",
    "figure  [ fig : tracer ] reports the corresponding results .",
    "it turns out that , due to the inelasticity of collisions  @xcite , the tracer reaches a granular temperature different from that of the surrounding particles . measuring a fd relation thus yields the granular temperature of the tracer but not that of the surrounding granular gas .",
    "the tracer is thus sensing a temperature whose value is the outcome of the complex interaction between the tracer itself and the granular gas .",
    "it is worth stressing how this happens _ even if the tracer almost does not perturb the granular_. this leads to the non - conventional result that the `` temperature '' measured as a fluctuation - dissipation ratio  @xcite , in a driven granular gas , depends on the thermometer .",
    "in this paper , we have shown by numerical simulations that , in a binary granular gas , each component of the mixture obeys a fd relation with its own granular temperature , while a global measurement provides a suitable definition of temperature only when equipartition is satisfied .",
    "these fd relations can be measured by different correlation - response pairs .",
    "in particular , the case of a tracer , which can act as a `` thermometer '' since it does not perturb the granular , has been investigated , and leads to the unusual conclusion that the measure of the temperature through fd relations would depend on the interaction between the tracer and the granular gas .",
    "notice that theoretical studies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) may then allow for an estimate of the gas temperature , knowing the temperature measured by the tracer .",
    "further investigations are needed to explore the scenarios bringing to violations of the fd relations  @xcite .",
    "this point becomes particularly important when , with more realistic energy injection through boundaries , we could expect heterogeneities giving rise to position - dependent temperatures",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate how a tracer particle would sample this inhomogeneous gas and ask about the meaning of the corresponding measured temperature .                                    there",
    "exist in fact small , but systematic , deviations from fd relations even at small inelasticities .",
    "these deviations appear even at the homogeneous boltzmann level ( investigated by dsmc ) , where they are linked to the non - gaussian behaviour of the velocity distribution due to the departure from equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the departure from ( [ eq : fdt ] ) will be studied in a separate publication .",
