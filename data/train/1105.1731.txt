    "gas - rich galaxy merging may trigger major starbursts , lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies , and account for the formation and growth of supermassive black holes ( bhs ; e.g. , sanders et al . 1988 ; hopkins et al . 2009 ) .",
    "this merger - driven evolutionary scenario starts with a completely obscured ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) .",
    "as the system evolves , the obscuring gas and dust is gradually dispersed , giving rise to dusty qsos and finally to completely exposed qsos .",
    "powerful winds , driven by the central quasar or the surrounding starburst , have been invoked to quench the growth of both the bh and spheroidal component and explain the tight bh - spheroid mass relation ( e.g. , di matteo et al .",
    "2005 , murray et al .",
    "these winds are purported to inhibit star formation in the merger remnants ( `` negative mechanical feedback '' ; e.g. veilleux et al .",
    "2005 for a review ) , and to create a population of red gas - poor ellipticals , thereby explaining the bimodal color distribution observed in large galaxy surveys ( e.g. , kauffmann et al . 2003 ) .",
    "finding observational evidence of such feedback processes in action is one of the main challenges of current extragalactic astronomy .",
    "while outflows have been observed frequently in many starbursts and qsos , so far they have been detected mostly in the ionized and neutral atomic gas component . to inhibit star formation in the host galaxy ,",

    "we demonstrate that far - infrared molecular spectroscopy with herschel - pacs of ( ultra- ) luminous infrared galaxies is providing a breakthrough in identifying and analyzing massive molecular outflows .",
    "our recent oh - absorption observations have revealed a @xmath51000 km / s molecular outflow in the closest quasar known , mrk231 ( fischer et al . 2010 ) .",
    "independent , spatially resolved co - emission observations of mrk231 with the iram / pdb mm - wave interferometer ( feruglio et al . 2010 ) have confirmed this outflow with inferred mass outflow rates of @xmath03002200 m@xmath1/yr , significantly larger than the current star formation rate ( sfr@xmath0100m@xmath1/yr ) in the host galaxy .",
    "we now show that molecular outflows are indeed a common phenomenon in many of the luminous major mergers in our sample , reaching outflow velocities of 1000 km / s and outflow rates up to @xmath01000 m@xmath1/yr in some of them .",

    "we present velocity - resolved line profiles of the oh 79@xmath6 m cross ladder , ground - state doublet for a small subset of our ulirg sample and a comparison starburst galaxy .",
    "the observations were obtained with the pacs far - infrared spectrometer ( poglitsch et al .",
    "2010 ) on board herschel ( pilbratt et al . 2010 ) .",
    "our data set also contains other oh transitions , but the 79@xmath6 m line was observed first and is common to all objects , as it can be obtained simultaneously ( in second order ) with the [ cii ] 157@xmath6 m line ( in first order ) . at 79@xmath6 m",
    "the pacs resolution is @xmath0140 km / s .",
    "the data reduction was done using the standard pacs reduction and calibration pipeline ( ipipe ) included in hipe 5.0 . however , for the final calibration we normalized the spectra to the telescope flux ( which dominates the total signal , except for ngc253 ) and re - calibrated it with a reference telescope spectrum obtained from dedicated neptune observations during the herschel performance verification phase .",
    "all of our objects ( except ngc253 ) are point sources for pacs . in the following we use the spectrum of the central 9@xmath7x9@xmath7 spatial pixel ( spaxel ) only , applying the point source correction factors ( psf losses ) as given in the pacs documentation .",
    "we have verified this approach by comparing the resulting continuum flux density level to the continuum level of all 25 spaxels combined ( which is free of psf losses and pointing uncertainties ) . in all cases",
    "the agreement is excellent , however the central spaxel alone provides better s / n .",
    "we note for completeness that for ngc253 the total oh 79@xmath6 m line profile summed over all 5@xmath85 spaxels yields emission , consistent with the iso - lws observations by bradford et al .",

    "the uncertainties of these velocities are dominated by the uncertainties in the continuum definition , the s / n ratio in the spectra , and the spectral resolution .",

    "these high oh outflow velocities may be the long - sought conclusive evidence of powerful mechanical feedback from vigorous star formation and/or accreting central black holes .",

    "iras17208 - 0014 , a starburst dominated ulirg with little agn contribution has only a slightly higher v@xmath37(370 km / s ) . in significant contrast to this",
    "the terminal velocities of the oh outflow in the two agn - dominated ulirgs ( mrk231 and iras08572 + 3915 ) are well above 1000 km / s .",
    "thus the oh outflow velocity could be a very promising tool to distinguish agn driven outflows from starburst driven outflows , with agn - dominated outflows reaching much higher velocities .    in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we compare the terminal outflow velocities to the star formation rates ( sfrs ) and agn - luminosities of our objects .",

    "to compute mass outflow rates ( @xmath66 ) for comparison with sfrs we have modeled the observed spectra using the radiative transfer code described in gonzlez - alfonso & cernicharo ( 1999 ) .",
    "the outflow is modeled as concentric expanding shells around a nuclear continuum source , allowing for each source one to three components with different velocity gradients and distances to the central source .",
    "such geometry reproduces quite naturally the red - shifted emission ( which is produced in the receding cocoons ) , and the blue - shifted absorption ( from the approaching parts ) .",

    "free parameters are the inner and outer radii and velocity field of each velocity component , the oh density at the inner radius , the covering factor of the continuum fir source , and the solid angle of the outflow .",

    "the excitation of the high - lying 65 @xmath6 m doublet requires high far - ir radiation densities , indicating that the line is tracing the inner , highly excited , molecular region of the outflowing material , close to the nuclear source ( gonzlez - alfonso et al .",
    "models that account for the 65 @xmath6 m line absorption simultaneously reproduce the two ground - state lines as well , indicating that the three observed oh lines - in contrast to the atomic naid lines , which are extended on galactic scales in some cases - are mostly sensitive to the inner @xmath68 kpc of the outflow .",

    "the uncertainty in @xmath66 is dominated by the adopted oh abundance , the properties of the underlying fir continuum source , and the outflow geometry .",
    "we adopt an overall uncertainty of 4 , derived from a study of the dependency of the fit results on the various model assumptions .",
    "the oh abundance relative to h@xmath9 is assumed to be @xmath70 , based on modeling of multi - transition oh observations of the galactic giant molecular cloud sgrb2 ( goicoechea & cernicharo 2002 ) . while oh abundances could reach values significantly lower in different environments ( e.g. in some of the models of sternberg & dalgarno 1995 and meijerink & spaans 2005 , or the observations by watson et al .",
    "1985 ) , we expect a relatively high oh abundance close to the nuclear region ( gonzlez - alfonso et al .",
    "2008 ) and note that @xmath66 increases with decreasing oh abundance . on the other hand ,",
    "even a high oh abundance of @xmath71 leads to mass loss rates of several hundred m@xmath20/yr .",
    "further details on the modeling will be given in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the starburst - dominated objects of our sample ( ngc253 , iras13120 - 5453 , and iras 17208 - 0014 ) have values of @xmath66 similar to their star formation rates .",
    "in contrast to this , the agn - dominated and/or warm ulirgs , as well as the heavily obscured ulirg , have outflow rates that are factors @xmath0420 larger than their sfr ( see table [ tab1 ] and figure [ fig3 ] , upper panel ) .",
    "the outflows we observe in the ulirgs - if continued at the current rate - are able to completely expel the cold gas reservoirs from the centres of these objects within @xmath010@xmath310@xmath4 years ( figure [ fig3 ] , lower panel ) .",
    "the gas depletion time is roughly inversely correlated with the agn luminosity ( and agn fraction ) .",
    "this is consistent with the merger scenario where the highest outflow rates are a short - lived , late , agn - dominated stage in the merger evolution .",
    "we note , however , that the lowest time scales we find ( few@xmath810@xmath3 years ) appear to be inconsistent with star formation / galaxy evolution models .",
    "we may have underestimated the time scales : a higher gas mass by a factor 2 and a higher oh abundance by a factor 2 would result in 4 times longer time scales ( which would still be within the error bars of figure 3 ) . a fundamental change in the basic model assumptions , like the geometry of the outflow , could also change the outflow rates .",
    "our current models are consistent with wide opening angles for the outflowing gas , but this is hard to prove with pacs spectra alone ( see below ) . for mrk231 , however , the high outflow rate is consistent ( within a factor 2 ) with the independent co observations ( pdbi mm - interferometry ) by feruglio et al . 2010 .",
    "very recently the high rates and the wide angle of the outflow have also been confirmed by optical spectroscopy through the analysis of broad wings of h@xmath41 and naid absorption ( rupke & veilleux 2011 ) .",
    "finally , the outflow may not continue at such a high rate , since - as gas and dust are removed - the outflows may be quenched as the radiation pressure decreases . therefore , our depletion time scales are time _ scales _ rather then absolute durations .",
    "we do not have the spatial resolution with herschel - pacs to study the spatial distribution of the outflowing material directly ( although observations of additional oh transitions with higher energy level , e.g. at 84 and 163 @xmath6 m , could help to further constrain the geometry of the models ) .",
    "true spatial information on the molecular component can only come from interferometric mm - observations ( e.g. feruglio et al .",
    "while the observed spectra shown here clearly exhibit high velocities , powerful molecular outflows , independent of our modelling , the conclusions based on outflow rates and agn fractions need further confirmation from increased statistics .",
    "our ongoing observations will cover a much larger sample of both starburst and agn dominated ( u)lirgs than shown here . combined with mm - interferometric follow up observations we will be able to better constrain our oh outflow models and further investigate the surprisingly low depletion time scales for some of the objects . the final sample should then allow us to study potential trends in the outflow characteristics .",
    "examples of such trends could be a different or tighter correlation of the outflow velocity with agn luminosity than with star formation rate , or the extent to which agn fractions and outflow velocities reflect different merger stages with evolving outflows creating lower and lower covering factors to the agn .",
