    "it is well known that in the local universe the obscuration towards star forming regions is correlated with star formation rate ( sfr ; e.g. , wang & heckman 1996 ; hopkins et al .",

    "the star forming regions can become optically - thick ( e.g. , genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) , which makes mid- and far - infrared ( mir , fir ) data critical for a complete metric of their sfr . at @xmath9 2 , where the average massive galaxy is forming stars at rates @xmath2 100 - 1000 times higher than in the local universe ( e.g. , prez - gonzlez et al .",
    "2005 ; juneau et al . 2005 ; damen et al . 2009 ) , mir- and fir - determined sfrs are critical for understanding the buildup of today s massive galaxies .",
    "the advent of the mips instrument onboard @xmath12 has facilitated the first deep photometry at 24@xmath1 and numerous studies have used these data to infer the star formation history of the universe up to @xmath9 2 ( e.g. , le floch et al . 2005 ; prez - gonzlez et al . 2005 ; caputi et al .",

    "these studies suggest that obscured star formation dominates in massive galaxies at @xmath9 2 ; however , the conversion from observed 24@xmath1 flux to a total infrared luminosity ( l@xmath3 ) , and subsequently a sfr at @xmath9 2 requires significant extrapolation based on local fir templates . the most common method for determining the l@xmath3 of a galaxy from 24@xmath1",
    "photometry is to artificially redshift local luminosity - dependent mir / fir templates to the redshift of the galaxy and then choose the l@xmath3 of the template that predicts a 24@xmath1 flux closest to the observed 24@xmath1 flux . by applying this method , or more sophisticated but related versions of it , some authors have found that the local templates produce estimates of l@xmath3 and sfr(l@xmath3 ) for distant galaxies that are in agreement with other sfr indicators ( e.g. , elbaz et al .",

    "2007a ; papovich et al .",
    "2009 ; kartaltepe et al .",
    "2010 ) , while others have argued that this method tends to systematically overestimate the l@xmath3 and hence the sfr ( e.g. , papovich et al . 2007 ; rigby et al . 2008 ; murphy et al .",
    "2009 ) . some of these differences can probably be reconciled by the different selection criteria ( e.g. , reddy et al .",

    "it is remarkable that despite an l@xmath3 @xmath2 10@xmath7 l@xmath5 , both of the blast - detected @xmath9 2 galaxies are better fit with local templates that have pah features and a cool `` cold '' dust bump . in the nearby universe ,",
    "galaxies with l@xmath3 @xmath2 10@xmath7 l@xmath5 tend to have both the warmest `` cold '' dust ( t@xmath58 @xmath2 10  70k , emission peaking in the fir ) and significant amounts of `` hot '' dust ( t@xmath58 @xmath2 70  500k , emission peaking in the mir ) .",
    "although both of these dust components can come from deeply embedded star formation ( e.g. , tran et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is thought that the dominant radiation source in most , if not all nearby galaxies with l @xmath2 10@xmath7 l@xmath5 is an agn ( e.g. , genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; lutz et al . 1998 ) .",
    "by contrast , the best fit templates of the @xmath9 2 galaxies are much cooler ulirg and lirg templates which are most frequently associated with star forming galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. , armus 2009 ) .",
    "these templates also tend to have stronger pah features that are more prevalent because the `` hot '' dust component from the agn no longer dominates the mir emission .",
    "the first claims that ir luminous galaxies at @xmath9 2 may be scaled up versions of lower luminosity cooler galaxies came from 24@xmath1 observations of submillimeter - selected galaxies ( smgs ) .",
    "pope et al . ( 2006 ) showed that the seds of smgs peak at longer wavelengths than expected based on an extrapolation of their 24@xmath1 flux using local templates , arguing that smgs are cooler at a given luminosity than the local templates .",

    "pope et al . ( 2008 ) and menendez - delmestre et al . ( 2009 ) showed that the mir seds of most smgs ( the blast - detected galaxies are formally smgs ) are still dominated by pahs and that agn only contribute @xmath2 30% of the total mir emission . putting the evidence together",
    "the most plausible scenario is that both galaxies host a moderate - luminosity agn , but the agn does not dominate the mir / fir sed .",
    "nevertheless , we note that both our sfr(l@xmath3 ) and sfr(h@xmath8 ) should be formally considered upper limits as the agn will contribute to both of these .",

    "likewise , the balmer decrement measurements for these galaxies seem to indicate extra extinction toward the star forming regions .",
    "it appears that on average this relation is similar to that suggested by calzetti et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; however , the lack of secure h@xmath42 detections in our sample precludes quantitative statements . to correctly determine the sfr(h@xmath8 ) of individual galaxies , rather than ensemble averages requires high quality balmer decrement measurements .",

    "our results suggest that a substantial population of massive @xmath9 2 galaxies are `` scaled up '' versions of lower luminosity galaxies .",
    "clearly such a population needs to be understood within the context of modern galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "recently , hopkins et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have used their merger - driven evolutionary model to predict the ir luminosity functions of galaxies and quasars between 0 @xmath37 6 . in their model",
    "they argue that there is a threshold in l@xmath3 above which disks , merger - driven star formation , and obscured agn are the dominant ir energy source of galaxies . at @xmath81",

    "interestingly , the fir seds of these galaxies do not look like those of the agn - dominated hlirgs detected by @xmath83 ( genzel et al .",
    "1998 ) , or of the average nearby ulirg , which are mostly merger - driven starbursts ( e.g. , sanders et al . 1998 ) . instead",
    ", these galaxies look like scaled up versions of even lower luminosity systems , which are not universally associated with mergers or agn .",
    "taken at face value , it appears they do not fit well within the hopkins et al .",
    "( 2010 ) description . on the other hand ,",
    "the nic2 morphologies of the galaxies are clearly disturbed enough to be considered candidates for undergoing mergers ( kriek et al .",
    "if these galaxies are merger - driven starbursts , it may be that they are missing the centrally - concentrated starburst which produces the much hotter dust seen in these galaxies in the local universe .",
    "as hopkins et al .",
    "( 2010 ) point out , the efficiency of a merger at funneling gas and stars into the core of the galaxy is proportional to the gas fraction , with higher gas fraction mergers being less efficient .",
    "if both galaxies have high gas fractions most of the star formation could be occurring on much larger physical scales than similar mass starbursts in the local universe , hence the cool dust sed .",
    "galaxies with similar stellar masses ( m @xmath2 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 ) and gas fractions as high as 80% have been observed in the distant universe ( e.g. , tacconi et al .",
    "2010 ) and could be analogues of the blast - detected galaxies . if that is the case , it begs the question of what are the descendants of extended , massive , gas - rich star forming galaxies at @xmath9 2 ?",
    "local spheroids seem like an obvious candidate ; however , some fraction of the progenitors of those systems are clearly small and quiescent at @xmath9 2 ( e.g. , van dokkum et al .",
    "2010 ; hopkins et al . 2010 ; bezanson et al . 2009 ; van der wel et al .",
    "if the large and active blast - sources are also progenitors of massive local spheroids it suggests there may be very different evolutionary paths which arrive at the same galaxies .",
    "these galaxies also appear to be consistent with the `` stream - fed '' galaxies proposed by dekel et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and the scaled up `` turbulent disks '' discussed by genzel et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . in their model , dekel et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest that massive galaxies may grow quickly through rapid cold gas accretion and clumpy star formation which funnels stars into a central bulge .",
    "given that these cold flows often separate into multiple large star forming clumps , it might be expected that these clumps produce cooler dust temperatures at fixed sfr than centrally concentrated starbursts .",
    "the sfrs of the blast galaxies are higher than the 100  200 m@xmath5 yr@xmath15 predicted for `` stream - fed '' galaxies by dekel et al .",
    "the blast galaxies are the most ir luminous of the k - selected sample of kriek et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , so if they are `` stream - fed '' galaxies , they may just represent the most active tail of the distribution .",
    "high quality kinematic data could potentially distinguish between merger - dominated or accretion - dominated systems .",
    "these galaxies do have sinfoni ifu observations ; however , these data lack the s / n to reliably determine v/@xmath24 .",
    "therefore , at present based on the mir / fir properties and morphologies we can not distinguish between evolutionary models such suggested by both hopkins et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and dekel et al .",
    "using a combination of data from the spitzer , blast and apex observatories we have presented some of the first well - sampled fir seds for two @xmath9 2 galaxies with rest - frame optical spectroscopy . in both galaxies we see a clear peak in the fir emission at @xmath2 300@xmath1 which is caused by the redshifted thermal emission from dust .",
    "the fir seds of the galaxies are well described by local templates ; however , the l@xmath3 appears to be an order of magnitude larger than the l@xmath3 associated with the locally calibrated templates .",
    "this suggests that these galaxies are likely to be scaled up versions of `` cool '' local galaxies , rather than analogues of nearby hlirg templates .",
    "a comparison of sfr(l@xmath3 ) and sfr(h@xmath8 ) for these two galaxies shows that they are consistent ; however , if we use only the 24@xmath1 photometry and the local luminosity dependent templates to determine the sfr we find that this overestimates the sfr(h@xmath8 ) by as much as a factor of 6 . a larger sample of 24 galaxies from the kriek et al .",
    "gnirs sample shows the same relation between sfr(24@xmath1 ) and sfr(h@xmath8 ) and suggests that many massive galaxies at @xmath9 2 are likely to be scaled up versions of lower luminosity galaxies .",
