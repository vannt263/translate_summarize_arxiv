    "recent work by @xcite has questioned the attribution of lines observed in the horsehead nebula photodissociation region ( pdr ) to @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .",
    "quartic force fields ( qffs ) computed from high - level @xmath12 quantum mechanical energies analyzed using perturbation theory at second order @xcite are known to produce highly accurate spectroscopic constants . even though the @xmath13 computed by @xcite",
    "( 11 262.68 mhz ) is within 0.16% of the @xmath14-type rotational constant derived from the observations by @xcite ( 11 244.9474 mhz ) , the computed @xmath15 of 4.248 khz differs by 44.5% from the observed @xmath7 value of 7.652 khz",
    ". this  error \" is more than an order of magnitude larger than any other error for a computed @xmath15 of a cation ( using similar levels of theory ) as compared to known high - resolution experimental data .",
    "furthermore , the sextic distortion constant , @xmath16 , differs by three orders of magnitude . as a result ,",
    "it is unlikely that @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 corresponds to the lines observed by @xcite .",
    "this result motivates the question ,  what is the carrier of these lines ? \"",
    "if these observed lines are , in fact , related to one another , certain inferences can be made about the molecular carrier . to match the rotational constants derived from the transition energies corresponding to the observed lines , the carrier is either linear or quasi - linear ,",
    "almost certainly composed of three carbon atoms as well as a single hydrogen atom , and closed - shell since there are no splittings in the lines as required for the rotational spectra of open - shell molecules @xcite .",
    "all of these criteria are , in fact , met by @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 , but this cation s difference between observational and high - accuracy theoretical rotational constants , especially the @xmath7 constant , discussed above and by @xcite , probably rules it out . as a result ,",
    "the quasi - linear anion , @xmath17 @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath4 , remains as the most likely candidate carrier of the horsehead nebula pdr rotational lines of interest especially since anions have been shown to be more abundant in the interstellar medium ( ism ) than originally thought @xcite , and there has been reason to suspect the presence of c@xmath8h@xmath4 in the horsehead nebula pdr @xcite .    even though the most stable singlet isomer of c@xmath1h@xmath4 is the cyclic form , @xmath18-c@xmath1h@xmath4 , the barrier to isomerization is high enough ( @xmath19 kcal mol@xmath20 ) for the quasi - linear @xmath21 isomer to be kinetically stable @xcite .",
    "various mechanisms for interstellar synthesis of this anion are possible @xcite and are probably related to those responsible for the creation of the related c@xmath22h@xmath4 for @xmath23 anions previously detected in the ism @xcite .",
    "furthermore , radical c@xmath1h in both the linear and cyclic forms has also been detected in the ism @xcite suggesting the possible interstellar existence of the anion .    additionally , c@xmath1h@xmath4 is of astronomical interest since it has been computationally shown by @xcite to possess not only a rare dipole - bound singlet excited electronic state ( the @xmath24 state ) but also an even more rare valence excited state ( @xmath25 ) below the electron binding or electron detachment energy .",
    "in fact , the valence electronically excited state is the only such state thus far proposed to exist for an anion of this size which also contains only first - row atoms @xcite .",
    "the valence excited state and the bent structure of c@xmath1h@xmath4 are both the result of an unfilled @xmath26 orbital .",
    "the two components of the homo @xmath26-type orbital split when the additional electron in the anion spin - pairs with the lone electron in the radical s @xmath26-type homo . a carbene and bent structure are thus created . the valence ( @xmath25 ) state of c@xmath1h@xmath4 is then the product of an excitation from the occupied portion of the split @xmath26 orbital into the unoccupied portion , an uncommon process not present in the c@xmath22h@xmath4 anions .",
    "furthermore , anions have been proposed as carriers of some diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) @xcite , and the two electronically excited states of c@xmath1h@xmath4 may be of importance to the dibs and to the chemistry of pdrs , as well .",
    "the spectroscopic constants and fundamental vibrational frequencies of @xmath27 @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath4 are computed through the established means of qffs @xcite . starting from a restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) @xcite coupled cluster @xcite singles , doubles , and perturbative triples [ ccsd(t ) ] @xcite aug - cc - pv5z @xcite geometry further corrected for core correlation effects from the martin - taylor ( mt ) basis set @xcite , a grid of 743 symmetry - unique points is generated .",
    "simple - internal coordinates for the bond lengths and @xmath28 h@xmath11c@xmath11c are coupled to linear linx and liny @xcite coordinates exactly as those defined in @xcite for hoco@xmath2 .",
    "displacements of 0.005   for the bond lengths , 0.005 rad for the bond angle , and 0.005 for the linx and liny coordinates and the associated energies computed at each point define the qff , which is of the form : @xmath29 where @xmath30",
    "are the displacements and @xmath31 are force constants @xcite .    at each point , ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvxz ( where @xmath32 )",
    "energies are computed and extrapolated to the complete basis set ( cbs ) limit via a three - point formula @xcite .",
    "additionally , energy corrections are made to the cbs energy for core correlation and for scalar relativistic effects @xcite .",
    "the resulting qff is denoted as the cccr qff for the cbs energy , core correlation correction , and scalar relativistic correction , respectively , @xcite .",
    "the augmented dunning basis sets have been shown by @xcite to be reliable for computations of anionic properties .",
    "an initial least - squares - fit of the cccr energy points leads to a minor transformation of the reference geometry such that the gradients are identically zero .",
    "this geometry and the resulting force constants are then employed in the rovibrational computations .",
    "all electronic structure computations make use of the molpro 2010.1 quantum chemical package @xcite , and all employ the born - oppenheimer approximation making the qffs identical for the isotopologues .",
    "the qff is fit from the 805 redundant total energy points with a sum of squared residuals on the order of @xmath33 a.u.@xmath34 cartesian derivatives are then computed from the qff with the intder program @xcite . from these ,",
    "the spectro program @xcite employs second - order vibrational perturbation theory ( vpt2 ) to generate the spectroscopic constants @xcite and vibrational frequencies @xcite . after transforming the force constants into the morse - cosine coordinate system so that the potential possesses proper limiting behavior @xcite , vibrational configuration interaction ( vci ) computations with the multimode program @xcite also produce vibrational frequencies .",
    "the vci computations make use of similar basis set configurations as those utilized by @xcite in similar quasi - linear tetra - atomic systems .",
    "the force constants computed in this study are listed in table [ fc1 ] .",
    "the cccr geometrical parameters and spectroscopic constants are given in table [ structharm ] for both @xmath3 @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath4 and the deuterated isotopologue .",
    "the equilibrium dipole moment is computed with respect to the center - of - mass with ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pv5z to be 2.16 d. the c@xmath11c@xmath11c @xmath35 vibrationally - averaged bond angle is nearly collinear at 174.540@xmath36 while the vibrationally - averaged @xmath28h@xmath11c@xmath11c is 109.491@xmath36 .",
    "these values are in line with those computed by @xcite .",
    "as has been discussed by @xcite for c@xmath1h@xmath4 , the c@xmath37 carbon atom adjacent to the hydrogen atom shown in figure [ fig ] is a carbene - type carbon containing a lone pair which leads to a longer c@xmath38c@xmath39 bond length compared to the shorter c@xmath40c@xmath1 bond length .",
    "even though this result differs from the ccsd(t ) results from @xcite , their reported casscf and hf results give bond lengths similar to ours leading us to conclude that the ccsd(t ) c@xmath11c bond lengths are mislabeled in the paper by @xcite .",
    "the vibrationally - averaged geometrical parameters change slightly upon deuteration .",
    "similar bond angles of the heavy atoms have been computed for the @xmath41-hoco@xmath2 , hocs@xmath2 , and hsco@xmath2 systems @xcite with very good agreement present for known experimental data .",
    "the most notable values in table [ structharm ] are the rotational constants and the quartic centrifugal distortion ( @xmath7-type ) constants . for @xmath3 @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath4 , the @xmath13 rotational constant",
    "is 11 339.66 mhz while @xmath42 is 11 087.35 mhz .",
    "the equilibrium constants are slightly larger , but both sets are in reasonable agreement with those computed by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7-type constants have not been vibrationally - averaged , and @xmath43 , most prominently , is 4.954 khz .",
    "direct comparison between these explicitly computed values and those deduced from the horsehead nebula pdr spectrum observed by @xcite is not possible since the isomer of c@xmath1h@xmath4 of interest here is not perfectly linear .",
    "@xcite assume a linear structure in order to fit the effective rotational constant , @xmath44 , and the effective centrifugal distortion constant , @xmath6 and use the second - order fitting equation , @xmath45 to compute the affiliated rotational constants .",
    "c@xmath1h@xmath4 is non - linear and requires the following related equation from @xcite : @xmath46 } \\right\\}(j+1)^3 , \\label{nonlin}\\ ] ] with the assumption that @xmath47 forcing @xmath48 . as such , we can set equation [ lin ] equal to equation [ nonlin ] .",
    "the @xmath49 term in equation [ nonlin ] is equal to @xmath50 , and the @xmath51 term in equation [ nonlin ] is equal to @xmath52 . using the cccr computed @xmath53 , @xmath13 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 values , where @xmath43 is the only equilibrium constant , @xmath44 is computed to be 11 213.51 mhz , and @xmath6 is 8.795 khz .",
    "hence , direct comparison between the cccr c@xmath1h@xmath4 derived effective rotational constants and those obtained from the lines observed by @xcite is possible .",
    "the second - order fit of the lines observed by @xcite indicates that the carrier must have a @xmath14-type constant that is very close to 11 244.9474 mhz and a @xmath7-type quartic distortion constant that is around 7.652 khz .",
    "the @xmath44 computed with the @xmath53 , @xmath13 , and @xmath42 rotational constants by the above approach is very close , off by 31.44 mhz or 0.28% .",
    "this is roughly the same difference between the observed @xmath14 and that of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "however , the 8.795 khz @xmath6 for @xmath3 @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath4 is much closer to the 7.652 khz @xmath7 derived from the lines observed by @xcite in the horsehead nebula than the linear cation @xcite .",
    "even so , this @xmath6 of 8.795 khz differs from the observation by 1.14 khz or 14.93% .",
    "table [ errors ] provides some insight into the accuracies that can be expected for calculated rotational constants of similar molecules .",
    "related quasilinear molecules studied previously have all been cations .",
    "hence , within table [ errors ] , the cation @xmath14 and @xmath7-type constants listed are more correctly understood to be @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath6 as is the case for c@xmath1h@xmath4 ( @xmath54 equation [ nonlin ] is used ) .",
    "calculation of the vibrationally - averaged @xmath44 values incorporate @xmath13 and @xmath42 while the equilibrium @xmath44 values incorporate @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "calculation of @xmath6 for each of the bent , quasilinear systems utilizes @xmath53 , @xmath13 , and @xmath42 and the equilibrium @xmath43 value since vibrational averaging is not available for the @xmath7-type constants .",
    "the lone exception to this definition of @xmath6 is the c@xmath1h@xmath4 @xmath6 computed with @xmath57 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 given in the second line of table [ errors ] , which actually lowers the c@xmath1h@xmath4 @xmath6 value to 8.366 khz , a difference of 0.714 khz or 9.34% from that determined by @xcite . finally ,",
    "since all of the anions observed in the ism have been linear , directly comparable @xmath13 , @xmath55 , and @xmath15 constants have been computed explicitly and are listed in table [ errors ] .    from table [ errors",
    "] , the quasi - linear cations listed below c@xmath1h@xmath4 show strong correlation between the computed @xmath44 from the use of @xmath13 and @xmath42 and the @xmath44 derived from the various experiments .",
    "additionally , the @xmath6 values computed the same way with the equilibrium @xmath43 also show good , albeit not as strong , correlation between theory and experiment .",
    "unfortunately , c@xmath1h@xmath4 has errors that are larger than this .",
    "however , this probably results from a combination of basis set incompleteness and higher - order correlation effects . even though aug - cc - pvxz basis sets used at the ccsd(t ) level of theory have been shown to be effective in the computation of anionic properties @xcite , higher - order properties such as the @xmath7-type constants are more susceptible to even the smallest errors .",
    "this is clear for the cations as well , where the @xmath6 values are not as accurate as the @xmath44 values .",
    "the known interstellar anions and the related c@xmath39h@xmath4 system , which has not yet been detected in the ism , are linear and have @xmath14 and @xmath7 computed directly , either as b@xmath58 or @xmath55 and @xmath15 .",
    "note that the theoretical rotational constants are not as accurate for the anions as they are for the cations .",
    "most notably , the @xmath55/@xmath13 and @xmath15 values computed with a ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pcv5z cubic force field for c@xmath59n@xmath4 by @xcite are directly used in the identification of this anion in the ism @xcite . as listed in table [ errors ] , agreement between computed @xmath14 values and that necessary to match the observed rotational lines actually worsens when @xmath13 is used instead of @xmath55 , more than doubling the percent error .",
    "this is the same behavior as what is currently found for c@xmath1h@xmath4 .",
    "additionally , the @xmath15 percent error for c@xmath59n@xmath4 , as compared to observation , is 9.1% , almost exactly what it is for c@xmath1h@xmath4 when using the equilibrium rotational constants .",
    "the force field employed by @xcite also includes core correlation like the cccr qff .",
    "hence , the present rotational constants are in the same accuracy range for c@xmath1h@xmath4 as those used to detect c@xmath59n@xmath4 in the ism . furthermore , the calculated @xmath15 values compared to experiment for c@xmath8h@xmath4 and c@xmath60h@xmath4 actually have a larger percent error than @xmath6 for c@xmath1n@xmath4 , c@xmath59n@xmath4 , or even c@xmath1h@xmath4 .",
    "comparison of the sextic distortion constant , @xmath61 , is not as straightforward .",
    "there is a dearth of data on how the computation of this value for anions compares to experiment .",
    "@xmath62 , which is an equilibrium value , is not exactly @xmath61 , but they are probably related . even though @xmath16 obtained by @xcite is 560 mhz and @xmath62 for c@xmath1h@xmath4 is 3.344 mhz , this is an order of magnitude closer agreement than this same @xmath16 compared to the @xmath63 for @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 , 0.375 mhz @xcite .",
    "additionally , the same basis set and correlation errors for anions that affect the calculation of @xmath7 will be present for @xmath16 . as a result",
    ", we can only say here that as far as @xmath16 is concerned for comparison to the lines observed in the horsehead nebula by @xcite , @xmath3 c@xmath1h@xmath4 is a better candidate than @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 .    even though lower levels of theory have been used to reproduce rotational constants of the detected , linear interstellar anions , c@xmath1h@xmath4 is the only anion examined here that is not linear .",
    "it is known that basis set effects can be pronounced in the computation of bond angles in anions @xcite where the average change in a bond angle computed with a standard basis set and one augmented to include diffuse functions is around 1.0@xmath36 .",
    "for example , the equilibrium @xmath28c@xmath11c@xmath11c in c@xmath1h@xmath4 from a simple ccsd(t)/cc - pvtz qff is 173.32@xmath36 , while this same angle is 174.20@xmath36 with a ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz qff .",
    "in fact , the resulting 0.88@xmath36 difference by simply adding diffuse functions to the standard basis set is actually larger than the equilibrium @xmath28c@xmath11c@xmath11c difference between the ccsd(t)/aug - cc - pvtz qff and that from the cccr qff , 0.38@xmath36 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath44 for c@xmath1h@xmath4 is slower to converge with respect to the basis set chosen relative to the linear anions .",
    "this is made clear in that the ccsd(t)/cc - pvtz qff vibrationally - averaged @xmath44 is 11 056.74 mhz whereas the corresponding cccr @xmath44 is 11 213.51 mhz , an increase of 156.77 mhz .",
    "the linear anions are able to use lower level levels of theory in order to approach the experimental rotational constants , but higher levels of theory are required for the non - linear anion .",
    "the fact that @xmath44 computed with the equilibrium rotational constants is closer to the @xmath14 derived from the observations by @xcite than @xmath44 computed with the vibrationally - averaged rotational constants is coincidental .",
    "however , the important point is that the c@xmath1h@xmath4 vibrationally - averaged @xmath44 approaches the corresponding observed value as more accurate qffs are employed , and the remaining error is typical .",
    "the harmonic and anharmonic vibrational frequencies for both @xmath3 @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath4 and @xmath0-c@xmath1d@xmath4 are given in table [ vptvci ] .",
    "positive anharmonicities are present in both isotopologues for the @xmath64 c@xmath38c@xmath40c@xmath1 bending and the @xmath65 torsional modes .",
    "vpt2 and vci produce fundamental vibrational frequencies from the cccr qff that are quite consistent .",
    "the largest deviation between the methods , 1.0 cm@xmath20 , is found for the @xmath67 h@xmath11c@xmath38c@xmath39 bending mode .",
    "comparison of the c@xmath1h@xmath4 cccr qff anharmonic vibrational frequencies , whether using vpt2 or vci , to those computed by @xcite is roughly consistent for @xmath68-@xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath64 anharmonic frequencies differ by more than 50 cm@xmath20 , though the @xmath69 harmonic frequencies are very similar ( i.e. , the difference in the @xmath64 fundamental frequency is mostly due to differences in the anharmonic correction ) .",
    "the torsional mode is nearly identical between the two studies , though in this case the harmonic frequencies differ by more than 50 cm@xmath20 .",
    "it is hoped that the present qff computations of the fundamental vibrational frequencies provided here will assist in the characterization of this anion in current and future studies of the ism or simulated laboratory experiments at infrared wavelengths in addition to studies in the sub - millimeter spectral region .",
    "the lines observed by @xcite are present in the horsehead nebula pdr but not in the dense core . typically , a pdr is defined in terms of shells starting from the exterior shell dominated by an influx of far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) photons . in this region ,",
    "the photons are most often absorbed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) and dust particles .",
    "however , electrons are also produced in these regions from various mechanisms involving the aforementioned larger molecular particles as well as from interactions with atoms or small molecules . as the fuv flux is reduced from shielding resulting from the pahs and dust , the h@xmath39 shell is formed .",
    "moving further in to the region , co begins to form , and , finally , o@xmath39 formation is present in the dense core when the photon shielding is high enough @xcite .",
    "in fact , pdrs are believed to be a major cache of the interstellar molecular abundance due to the stability of the dense cores .",
    "it could be assumed that such a large flux of high - energy photons in the outer shells would remove any excess electron from an anion or even from many neutral radicals .",
    "however , this same process results in a veritable sea of elections that could attach to neutrals and actually lead to the creation of anions even in the horsehead nebula pdr @xcite . additionally , many anions are known to be surprisingly stable @xcite , and electron attachment rates are also believed to be quite high in these regions @xcite .",
    "several anions have also been shown to possess dipole - bound excited states , or threshold resonances , which may play a significant role in the creation and recreation of interstellar anions @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of radiative attachement ( ra ) , outlined by @xcite as radiative stabilization , describes attachment of an electron to a neutral speices , a , through creation of the excited electronic state of the resultant anion : @xmath70^ * } \\rightarrow \\mathrm{a^- } + h\\nu . \\label{ra}\\ ] ] relaxation can take place such that the electronic ground state of the anion would be present @xcite .    the dipole - bound ( and only ) excited state of a small anion typically should function as the necessary excited state for ra .",
    "dipole - bound states are known to exist for each of c@xmath71h@xmath4 , c@xmath8h@xmath4 , and c@xmath60h@xmath4 @xcite . in order for such a state to be present",
    ", the dipole moment of the corresponding neutral , a radical for these systems , must be on the order of 2 d or larger @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath72 ground states of c@xmath8h and c@xmath60h , the dipole moments are large enough to support a singlet dipole - bound excited state .",
    "c@xmath71h , @xmath73 in its ground state @xcite , has a relatively small dipole moment at 0.8 d @xcite .",
    "hence , in order for c@xmath71h@xmath4 to form , the radical must either excite out of the weakly dipolar @xmath74 state into the large - dipole @xmath75 state before undergoing ra , or it must form through another manner besides ra . as discussed by @xcite and @xcite , the need for radical excitation followed by ra could explain the very low @xmath76c@xmath71h@xmath77c@xmath71h@xmath78 $ ] ratio observed towards various interstellar objects @xcite .",
    "even though these two states of c@xmath71h are  nearly degenerate \" @xcite , some additional energy is required to populate the @xmath75 state , which , in turn , lowers the probability of electron attachment . furthermore , c@xmath39h is also @xmath73 in its ground state , but the excitation energy into the large - dipole @xmath75 state is more than double its counterpart in c@xmath71h @xcite , which may shed light on the even lower @xmath76c@xmath39h@xmath77c@xmath39h@xmath78 $ ] ratio proposed by @xcite .",
    "c@xmath8h@xmath4 and c@xmath60h@xmath4 could be present in the horsehead nebula pdr , as has been suggested from observations and modeling by @xcite , but these longer anions may only be accessible from their dipole - bound excited states . however , c@xmath1h@xmath4 has more than just a dipole - bound excited state .",
    "a few , rare anions possess valence excited electronic states between the dipole - bound state and the ground electronic state @xcite .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , @xmath3 c@xmath1h@xmath4 is , thus far , the only anion composed solely of first - row atoms ( and hydrogen ) to possess a valence singlet excited state @xcite .",
    "the presence of two excited electronic states with the same spin multiplicity should increase the production of c@xmath1h@xmath4 since multiple relaxation pathways exist .",
    "beginning from the dipole - bound state , the excited anion can relax within the ra mechanism to the ground electronic state either directly or via the valence excited state first .",
    "enough c@xmath1h@xmath4 may then exist in a steady state to counterbalance the destructive photons present in this region .",
    "if the horsehead nebula pdr abundances of @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 from @xcite can be inferred actually to be @xmath3 c@xmath1h@xmath4 , the @xmath76c@xmath1h@xmath77c@xmath1h@xmath78 $ ] ratio could be as high as 0.30 in the horsehead nebula pdr .",
    "this is not as high as the upper limit proposed for @xmath76c@xmath8h@xmath77c@xmath8h@xmath78 $ ] at 8.9 , but it is an order of magnitude larger than @xmath76c@xmath71h@xmath77c@xmath71h@xmath78 $ ] @xcite as can be expected since the ground electronic state of c@xmath1h is strongly dipolar and that of c@xmath71h is not .",
    "the amount of c@xmath1h@xmath4 should decrease as the observations move towards the dense molecular core due to the higher reactivity of this anion .",
    "the reaction cross - section of anions is much larger than in neutrals @xcite , and c@xmath1h@xmath4 could go through various destructive processes @xcite as the molecular density increases .",
    "alternatively , this anion could exist within the observed sightline but on the outer edge of the pdr where the photon flux is small enough for a measurable population to be stable . in this region",
    "a longer path length of such material is also present away from the high @xmath79 dense core .",
    "either way , the existence of @xmath3 c@xmath1h@xmath4 in the horsehead nebula pdr is feasible .",
    "since the link between @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 and the lines observed in the horsehead nebula pdr by @xcite has recently been strongly questioned by @xcite , another viable candidate is necessary .",
    "the rotational lines seem to require a closed - shell quasi - linear structure composed of three carbon atoms along with a hydrogen atom .",
    "@xmath3 c@xmath1h@xmath4 appears to be the most likely candidate . here",
    ", the cccr qff has determined a @xmath44 for this anion to be in error by 0.28% from that required to fit the observed lines .",
    "the use of the equilibrium rotational constants fortuitously lowers the error to 0.11% .",
    "however , the error reduction and error magnitudes themselves are in line with the computed c@xmath59n@xmath4 rotational constants used in its interstellar detection .",
    "additionally , the discrepancy between the @xmath57 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 computed c@xmath1h@xmath4 @xmath6 and the @xmath6 deduced from the observed interstellar rotational lines is similar to the @xmath15 errors for c@xmath71h@xmath4 , c@xmath1n@xmath4 , and c@xmath59n@xmath4 and less than that of c@xmath8h@xmath4 , which are all reported for ccsd(t ) computations , @xmath54 similar levels of theory .",
    "hence , the consistency of the errors for c@xmath1h@xmath4 with other anions previously detected in the ism coupled with its matching the required spectral criteria and the rationale for its existence involving its valence and dipole - bound excited states , make this anion the strongest candidate carrier for the horsehead nebula pdr lines and , potentially , the seventh and most recent anion detected in the ism .",
    "it would also be the first detected interstellar odd - numbered carbon monohydrogen chain anion .",

    "<S> the @xmath5 computed spectroscopic constants provided in this work are , compared to those necessary to define the observed lines , as accurate as the computed spectroscopic constants for many of the known interstellar anions . additionally , the computed @xmath6 for c@xmath1h@xmath4 is three times closer to the @xmath7 deduced from the observed horsehead nebula lines relative to @xmath0-c@xmath1h@xmath2 . as a result , @xmath3 c@xmath1h@xmath4 is a more viable candidate for these observed rotational transitions . </S>",
    "<S> it has been previously proposed that at least c@xmath8h@xmath4 may be present in the horsehead nebular pdr formed by way of radiative attachment through its dipole - bound excited state . </S>",
    "<S> c@xmath1h@xmath4 could form in a similar way through its dipole - bound state , but its valence excited state increases the number of relaxation pathways possible to reach the ground electronic state . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , the rate of formation for c@xmath1h@xmath4 could be greater than the rate of its destruction . </S>",
    "<S> c@xmath1h@xmath4 would be the seventh confirmed interstellar anion detected within the past decade and the first c@xmath9h@xmath4 molecular anion with an odd @xmath10 .    </S>",
