    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize the results in @xcite for vacuum einstein field equations to non - vacuum einstein field equations . in @xcite",
    ", we proved that any geodesically complete 4-d spacetime with a timelike killing field satisfying the vacuum einstein field equation with nonnegative cosmological constant is actually flat .",
    "this result generalized the previous results in @xcite and @xcite by removing the extra conditions ( like chronological condition ) imposed on their theorems .    because the physical spacetime can never be flat",
    ", it must violate the assumptions in the theorem in @xcite , for instance , the geodesic completeness . also , by the singularity theorem of penrose and hawking ( see @xcite chapter 8) , the geodesic completeness of the physical spacetime is also hardly valid .",
    "moreover , we know that many stationary spacetimes contain black holes , see @xcite @xcite . in @xcite , in order to prove the above result , we actually derived a local curvature estimate ( see theorem 1.3 in @xcite ) , which does not require the spacetime to be geodesically complete .",
    "so from this point of view , the local curvature estimate in @xcite seems to be more important .    in this paper , we are mainly concerned with the einstein field equations in the presence of two kinds of matters or fields , the electromagnetic fields and scalar fields . for the former case ,",
    "the interaction of the gravity ( a 4-d spacetime @xmath0 ) and the electromagnetic field ( a 2-form @xmath1 ) is described by a system of differential equations called einstein - maxwell equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 are constants , @xmath4 . the second equation in ( [ em ] ) satisfied by the 2-form @xmath5 ( electromagnetic field )",
    "is called the maxwell equation .    a scalar field , in physics , associates a value ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) to each point of the spacetime , like temperature , pressure etc . in this paper",
    ", we consider the klein - gordon scalar fields , which can be used to describe the @xmath8 , or @xmath9 mesons .",
    "the einstein equation coupled with klein - gordon equation is the following @xmath10\\\\ & \\triangle_{g_m } \\phi = \\frac{m^2}{\\hbar^2 } \\phi \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 @xmath12 ( mass ) , @xmath13 ( reduced planck constant ) are constants , @xmath14 or @xmath15 is a map ( scalar field ) .",
    "the ( uncharged ) einstein - maxwell - klein - gordon equation is a combination of ( [ em ] ) and ( [ ekg ] ) ( see @xcite chapter 3 ) : @xmath16\\\\ & df = d\\ast f=0\\\\ & \\triangle_{g_m } \\phi = \\frac{m^2}{\\hbar^2 } \\phi . \\end{split}\\ ] ]    it is easy to see that ( [ emkg ] ) reduces to ( [ em ] ) or ( [ ekg ] ) when @xmath17 or @xmath18 in ( [ emkg ] ) .",
    "so instead of dealing with ( [ em ] ) and ( [ ekg ] ) separately , we can handle only one equation ( [ emkg ] ) .",
    "let @xmath19 be a timelike killing field on @xmath20 , by which we say the spacetime @xmath0 is stationary .",
    "following @xcite @xcite , we say the solution @xmath21 in ( [ emkg ] ) is inheriting if @xmath1 and @xmath22 satisfy @xmath23 which means that @xmath1 and @xmath22 inherit the @xmath19-symmetry from the metric tensor @xmath24",
    ".    denote the electric and magnetic fields ( related to @xmath19 ) by @xmath25 respectively , where @xmath26 is the tensor contraction of @xmath1 with @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath27 be the 1-form on @xmath20 obtained from @xmath19 by lowering indices .",
    "we associate a riemannian metric tensor @xmath28 on @xmath20 to @xmath24 ( see @xcite ) : @xmath29    the first main result of the paper is the following local curvature estimate :    [ n1.1 ] let @xmath0 be a 4-d spacetime with a timelike killing field @xmath19 such that @xmath24 satisfies the inheriting einstein - maxwell - klein - gordon equation ( [ emkg ] ) ( [ 1.4 ] ) , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constants . let @xmath32 be a @xmath33metric ball centered at @xmath34 of radius @xmath35 with compact closure in @xmath20 and @xmath36 then for any @xmath37 , there is a constant @xmath38 depending only on @xmath39 such that @xmath40    the hodge dual ( on three - space ) of the 2-form @xmath41 in ( [ 1.7 ] ) is a 1-form corresponding to the poynting vector in physics .",
    "a corollary of theorem [ n1.1 ] is the following    [ n1.2 ] let @xmath0 be a geodesically complete 4-d spacetime with a timelike killing field @xmath19 such that @xmath24 satisfies the inheriting einstein - maxwell - klein - gordon equation ( [ emkg ] ) ( [ 1.4 ] ) , where @xmath42 .",
    "we assume the poynting vector vanishes on @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath0 is flat .",
    "we give a possible physical explanation why theorem [ n1.1 ] or theorem [ n1.2 ] hold for @xmath42 ( but not the contrary ) .",
    "it is well - known that positive cosmological constant @xmath44 and negative energy ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 ) will cause the acceleration of the universe .",
    "intuitively , the acceleration will reduce the density of the matter or energy distribution of the universe , hence make the spacetime more `` regular '' .",
    "the spacetime being static implies that the poynting vector vanishes , i.e. @xmath47 .",
    "we say a stationary spacetime is static if the orthogonal complement of the timelike killing field is an integrable distribution . in general , when dim @xmath48 , the `` curvature '' measuring the difference between stationaryness and staticity is difficult to control . in order to generalize theorems [ n1.1 ] and [ n1.2 ] to dim @xmath48",
    ", we can assume for simplicity that the spacetime is static . in this case",
    ", we can obtain analogous results for general dimensions , see theorems [ n3.1 ] , [ n3.2 ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we prove theorems [ n1.1 ] and [ n1.2 ] . in section 3 , we generalize the results to general dimensions .    * acknowledgement * the author is grateful to professors s. t. yau , x. p. zhu and dr",
