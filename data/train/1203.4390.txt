    "the application of quantum optical devices in quantum information processing , specifically the efforts in constructing quantum memories @xcite and quantum networks @xcite , is an active research area .",
    "the necessary part of such devices , employing the photons as flying q - bits , is the deterministic single - photon emitter - the `` photon pistol '' .",
    "the most promising scheme for the controlled generation of a single photon is based on the technique of vacuum stimulated raman scattering involving adiabatic passage ( stirap ) , proposed in @xcite and then realized experimentally in @xcite . in these experiments",
    "the three - level @xmath0 - type atom was adiabatically passing through a high - finesse cavity , one branch of the atomic @xmath0 - type transitions was in resonance with the quantized cavity field , while the other one was driven by the coherent laser field .",
    "in course of interaction with the fields inside the cavity the atom emitted a single photon .",
    "the two polarization degrees of freedom of the emitted photon provide the most natural way to encode the q - bit , however , in the early experiments @xcite the polarization of the emitted photons was not controlled , nor detected , and the degeneracy of resonant levels was not taken into account . in the subsequent experiments @xcite the magnetic field directed along the cavity axis",
    "was applied to lift the degeneracy of atomic levels and the frequencies of the driving field and of the cavity modes were adjusted to realize the non - degenerate @xmath0-scheme with three zeeman states , which allowed to produce the circularly polarized photons .",
    "the objective of this paper is to calculate the polarization state of the emitted photon and to study its dependence on the polarization of the driving laser field and on the atomic initial state for the arbitrary values of the level angular momenta and to look for the schemes enabling to produce photons with tailored polarizations .",
    "the stirap with the three - level atom with non - degenerate levels is well described in the reviews and textbooks ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in case of non - degenerate levels",
    "there exists the only dark state  the superposition of the ground state @xmath1 and some metastable state @xmath2  uncoupled to the excited level @xmath3 .",
    "in course of raman scattering the atom is adiabatically transferred from the initial state @xmath1 to the target state @xmath2 .",
    "the stirap with degenerate atomic levels and with classical coherent resonant fields was studied in @xcite , were it was shown that unlike the non - degenerate case the population from the initial ground state @xmath1 is not always totally transferred to the target level @xmath2 , but only if the order of degeneracy of this target state is not less , than the order of degeneracy of the initial state . in our previous papers @xcite",
    "we have studied the single - photon emission via non - adiabatic vacuum stimulated raman scattering of short pulses on the atoms with degenerate levels and with totally or partially resolved hyperfine structure , the polarization of the cavity mode was assumed to be well - determined and the dependence of the photon emission probability on the mutual orientation of polarizations of the driving pulse and that of the cavity mode was calculated . in the present paper the adiabatic raman scattering ( stirap ) is considered , and it is assumed that the cavity equally sustains both polarization modes .    in section 2 the interaction model and the evolution operator for this model in the adiabatic approximation are described , while in sections 3 and 4 the instantaneous eigenvectors of the interaction operator , which determine the evolution operator , are constructed and classified . in case of degenerate levels not only the number of these eigenvectors increases , but there appear the new types of these eigenvectors , non - existing in case of non - degenerate levels , like the dark states , which atomic part belongs to only one of the lower levels @xmath1 or @xmath2 , and the bright states , which couple the excited level @xmath3 with only one of the lower levels @xmath1 or @xmath2 . in section 5 the formula for the polarization matrix of the emitted photon is obtained and in section 6 this formula is used for calculation of the photon polarization matrix for the transitions with the angular momenta @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , corresponding to the transitions between the hyperfine structure components of the electronic levels @xmath8 and @xmath9 of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 atoms , which were employed in the experiments @xcite .",
    "let us consider the coherent laser field with the carrier frequency @xmath12 , which is in resonance with the frequency @xmath13 of an optically allowed transition @xmath14 between the ground state @xmath15 and the excited state @xmath16 , while the quantized cavity field with the carrier frequency @xmath17 is in resonance with the frequency @xmath18 of an optically allowed transition @xmath19 between the long - lived state @xmath20 and the same excited state @xmath16 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "here @xmath15 , @xmath20 and @xmath16 are the values of the angular momenta of the levels .",
    "the coherent laser field is characterized by the electric field strength @xmath21 while the quantized field of the cavity in the interaction representation is described by the operator : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the slowly varying amplitude and the unit polarization vector of the laser field , @xmath25 is the slowly varying amplitude of the cavity field , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the two unit orthogonal vectors of the two polarization modes of this field , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the photon annihilation operators for this modes .",
    "the temporal dependence @xmath25 of the cavity field amplitude appears due to the motion of the atom through the cavity or to some tailored alteration of cavity parameters .",
    "the equation for the slowly - varying density matrix @xmath30 of the system , which consists of a single three - level atom and two - mode cavity field , in the rotating - wave approximation and in case of raman resonance @xmath31 is as follows : @xmath32,\\ ] ] @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the projector on the subspace of the atomic excited level @xmath16 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the reduced rabi frequencies for the coherent laser field and for the cavity field , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the reduced matrix elements of the electric dipole moment operator for the transitions @xmath14 and @xmath19 , while @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the dimensionless electric dipole moment operators for the transitions @xmath14 and @xmath19 .",
