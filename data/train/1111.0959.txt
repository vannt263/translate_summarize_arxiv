    "in hierarchical models of galaxy formation , galaxies often experience mergers that result in early - type remnants .",
    "disk structures are also predicted to regrow around some of these remnants ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , allowing for transitions back from early- to late - type morphologies .",
    "observationally , a transition stage from late to early types , brought about by interactions , may be glimpsed in the population of e+a ( post - starburst ) galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , observational evidence for the opposite predicted transition , that from early- to late - type morphology , has remained more elusive .",

    "galex _ has enabled the discovery of extended ultraviolet ( xuv ) disks ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "_ galex _ has provided a useful platform for detection of star formation in early - type galaxies as well .",
    "@xcite find that extended uv emission is common in high - mass bulge - dominated galaxies , likely associated with modest reservoirs of cold gas in the disk that help fuel bulge and black hole growth .",
    "focusing specifically on galaxies with e / s0 morphology , extended uv emission has also been seen in ring structures around several s0 galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and @xcite recently identified an xuv disk around the nearby s0 ngc  404 .",
    "@xcite have also identified several @xmath9@xmath40.12 early - type galaxies with extended uv structures in far - ultraviolet @xmath11 imaging .",
    "the presence of xuv disks , however , can have a variety of interpretations .",
    "t07 , for example , suggest an association of xuv disks with interactions or minor perturbations . the raw material for xuv disk formation could be acquired externally from such interactions or from fresh cosmic gas accretion , either of which may be consistent with the extended disks and rings of hi commonly observed around e / s0s ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility for creating extended disks in early types is the fallback of tidal tails in late stage mergers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the evolutionary significance of disk growth may be greater in some of these scenarios than others .",
    "of particular interest is the scenario of cold mode gas accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which may be linked to disk building in `` blue - sequence e / s0s , '' a recently identified morphologically defined population of e / s0 galaxies on the blue sequence in color versus stellar mass ( @xcite , hereafter kgb ) .",
    "blue - sequence e / s0s are primarily found in non - cluster environments ( kgb ) , and as shown in kgb and @xcite , many display global gas reservoirs and specific star formation rates that could allow the growth of significant new disks on relatively short timescales .",
    "cold mode accretion occurs primarily below a critical shock heating stability mass ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) ; this mass may coincide with an observed `` gas - richness threshold '' stellar mass at @xmath6@xmath7 @xmath0 @xmath12 , below which blue - sequence e / s0s become suddenly common , along with gas - dominated galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see kgb regarding corrected mass scale ) .",
    "this low - mass regime may be where the most active e / s0 disk growth occurs ( kgb ) .",
    "blue - sequence e / s0s also occur in modest numbers up to stellar masses of @xmath0@xmath13 , the bimodality mass of @xcite , above which classical spheroids with older stellar populations begin to dominate .    to better understand the significance of recent disk star formation in e / s0s , we concentrate on the mass regime up to the bimodality mass and seek to quantify the incidence of extended - disk star formation in a representative , largely field sample of e / s0s . in  2 ,",
    "we introduce our chosen sample and basic data . in  3 , we discuss various methods for identifying extended star formation , adopting the t07 type 1 xuv - disk designation as a reference .",

    "here we discuss uv - based methods for identifying galaxies with recent star formation in disks and extended disks . ideally , we seek to employ a purely quantitative method of classification .",
    "we also seek to answer two distinct questions about extended star formation in our sample , for which different specific identification methods are relevant .",
    "first , does it occur beyond traditional star formation thresholds ?",
    "this question motivated the original `` type  1 '' xuv - disk definition of t07 , which we take as a reference in designing a purely quantitative xuv disk definition (  3.2 ) .",
    "second , is it _ significant _ ( in a mass - contribution sense ) in the optical outer disks of galaxies ?",
    "this question motivates our introduction of a new `` ultraviolet - bright '' ( uv - b ) disk definition (  3.3 ; see also table 1 for a summary of definitions used in this paper ) .",
    "we note that extension relative to uv - defined star formation thresholds does not necessarily imply extension beyond the full optical extent of the galaxy .",
    "thus , another natural question about extended star formation is : does it extend beyond the optical galaxy ?",
    "we will treat the answer to this question as a matter of investigation rather than definition , given that the radial extent of star formation relative to the optical disk may behave fundamentally differently in e / s0s vs. late - type galaxies , for example , in the case of inside - out disk ( re)growth .",
    "a natural choice for answering our first guiding question , concerning star formation extended beyond traditional star formation thresholds , is the t07 `` type  1 '' xuv - disk definition .",
    "t07 define type  1 xuv disks as displaying more than one structured uv - bright emission complex beyond a centralized surface - brightness contour corresponding to the expected star formation threshold ( equated to an nuv surface brightness of 27.35 ab magarcsec@xmath30 by t07 , roughly matching typical h@xmath31 and hi thresholds ; we label the corresponding radius @xmath24 ) .",
    "in addition to extension relative to this uv contour , the definition requires that the xuv emission take on a different morphology from any underlying optical emission .",
    "t07 also define a type  2 xuv - disk classification , but this is not geared towards tracing star formation beyond @xmath24 , and an issue with the definition implies that we can not apply it uniformly to early types .",
    "thus , we do not consider type  2 xuvs further here and henceforth are referring to type  1 xuvs when we reference t07 xuv designations .",
    "the t07 xuv definition is the basis for our new xuv definition ( described in  3.2 ) , but for completeness , we note that several other measures of bright and/or extended uv disks exist , most requiring high spatial resolution . for example , visual classification of uv structures such as rings is common in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a quantitative variant on extended uv disk identification involves measuring individual uv knots in the outer regions of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another quantitative approach lacking the high resolution requirement is the blue integrated uv - color cut of @xcite .",
    "however , with an integrated color cut alone the correspondence between blue color and extended star formation is not necessarily one - to - one .",
    "we modify this approach by adopting an _ outer - disk _ uv color cut in our uv - b disk definition ( see  3.3 ) , addressing our second guiding question regarding significant star formation in the optical outer disks of galaxies .",
    "to answer whether or not star formation occurs beyond @xmath24 , we adopt the t07 xuv - disk definition as a useful reference definition and construct a purely quantitative alternative .",
    "table 2 indicates the distribution and properties of the 16 xuvs we identify by the original t07 definition ; see figure [ galfig ] for an example .",
    "the primary criteria of the t07 xuv - disk classification are uv extension relative to @xmath24 and association of this emission with recent star formation . in the following sections , we discuss issues with these criteria that motivate elements of our modified definition , including consideration of possible uv upturn contributions and of the extended psf shelf in the _ galex _ nuv .",
    "a possible concern in identifying xuv disks in e / s0s is the prevalence of the uv upturn , i.e. , uv emission associated with old stellar populations @xcite . to mitigate this issue",
    ", we identify xuv disks in the nuv ( in contrast to t07 s use of a combination of fuv and nuv data ) since the uv upturn becomes stronger at fuv wavelengths .",
    "nonetheless , 5 of the 16 xuvs we find using the original t07 xuv - disk definition have xuv - disk region fuv@xmath32@xmath18 colors red enough to be consistent with a @xmath251 gyr ssp ( simple stellar population , as in t07 figure 1 )",
    ".    in general , the t07 requirement that uv emission take on a different morphology from any underlying optical emission should preclude classifying an underlying old population as a separate xuv disk .",
    "however , the subjective requirement of structured emission can be difficult to apply consistently to samples like our own : our galaxies tend to have smaller angular sizes than those of t07 , implying greater blurring at the low angular resolution of _ galex _ , so uv structure may be lost or be difficult to assess .",
    "an xuv - disk definition relaxing this requirement of structured emission has recently been applied by @xcite to a sample containing both early and late types , and they experiment with using an fuv@xmath33 cut to ensure young populations .    taking a similar approach but focusing on the nuv , we consider color cuts based on a suite of composite @xcite stellar population models using a salpeter ( 1955 ) initial mass function , as described in kgb ( see their  2.3 ) .",
    "these composite models are built from two ( young and old ) components , with set age options , combined in a variety of ratios to create a large model grid .",
    "similar to the grid of kgb , the young ssp age options are 5 , 25 , 100 , 290 , 640 , and 1000 myr , while the old ssp age options are 1.4 , 2.5 , 3.5 , ... , 13.5 gyr .",
    "the young ssp contributions can be 0% , 1% , 2% , 4% , 8% , 16% , 32% , 64% , or 100% of the population mass .",
    "ssp metallicites allowed in the grid are z @xmath34 0.008 , 0.02 , and 0.05 .",
    "the young ssp can have 11 different extinction values , but here we consider only zero - extinction models for comparison to observed outer - disk colors .",
    "we make no explicit restriction on the metallicity combinations of the composite population models we consider , although we find that consideration of metallicity restrictions that could be reasonable in specific circumstances , such as z@xmath35 @xmath36 z@xmath37 or z @xmath36 z@xmath38 , do not substantially change the model color distributions we report ( see figures [ lemfig ] and [ nkfrac ] ) .    in one version of their xuv - disk classifications , @xcite used a color cut at fuv-@xmath39 @xmath34 5 , designed to separate galaxies with recent xuv - disk star formation from those containing evolved populations ( divider based on empirical red / blue sequence division from @xcite ) .",
    "however , based on consideration of our stellar population model grid ( fig .",
    "[ lemfig ] ) , this color selection can potentially exclude up to @xmath030% of the composite populations with recently star - forming components .",
    "thus , we search for a different color selection that better encompasses composite stellar populations with young components . as a result of the aforementioned difficulties with using the fuv for this purpose and the practical usefulness of making such a selection in bands where data coverage is more complete , we prefer the nuv over the fuv .",
    "we find that nuv - based colors indeed display a more cleanly defined region where populations are predominantly old ( compare figures [ lemfig ] and [ nkfrac ] ) . from the model color distributions ,",
    "it is apparent that the fraction of purely old models increases significantly beyond nuv@xmath27 @xmath34 5 , which is where young model fractions start to decline as well .",
    "thus , we choose to exclude xuv disks with nuv@xmath27 @xmath25 5 .",
    "when applying the original t07 xuv - disk definition , classifiers must subjectively identify the presence of extended emission beyond @xmath40 .",
    "however , when classifying xuvs from _ galex _ nuv imaging , especially when considering galaxies with small angular sizes , the @xmath045@xmath23 shelf in the nuv psf ( http://www.galex.caltech.edu/researcher/techdoc -ch5.html ) may affect this judgement .",
    "thus , to design a quantitative test for extension relative to @xmath24 , we require that the nuv flux detected _ outside _ @xmath24 is significantly greater than ( @xmath253@xmath26 above ) the flux redistributed into this region by an artificial second convolution of the nuv psf with the flux _ inside _ this radius .",
    "this ( re)convolution is in addition to the natural convolution inherent in the images ; see figure [ galfig ] for an illustration .",
    "we note that for the xuv disks we have identified based on the original , subjective t07 definition , we have confirmed that this requirement is always satisfied .      in summary , for our `` purely quantitative xuv - disk '' designation , we ensure uv emission beyond @xmath24 by requiring @xmath253@xmath26 emission above the nuv psf shelf , and we ensure recent star formation by requiring nuv@xmath27 @xmath4 5 in the xuv - disk region beyond @xmath24 . properties and demographics of these xuv disks are presented in  4 ( see also table 2 ) and largely imply that this population is associated with recent but not necessarily significant outer - disk star formation .    with our new definition , we identify a similar fraction of xuv disks as when applying the traditional t07 type  1 xuv - disk definition ( see table 2 , figure [ 3pan ] ) , but the overlap between these classifications is not perfect .",
    "approximately 70% of the traditionally identified xuvs are among xuvs identified with our purely quantitative method . in cases where the classifications do not overlap ,",
    "the reason is either ( 1 ) insufficiently blue nuv@xmath27 color to satisfy the new definition s color cut or ( 2 ) uv disk morphology not distinct enough from the optical to satisfy the t07 type  1 definition .",
    "our color cut is more conservative in rejecting xuv disks that may contain evolved populations than the t07 requirement of morphological differences compared to the optical . on the other hand",
    ", the t07 morphology requirement may recover xuvs with even weaker or more incipient star formation than our definition allows , where this star formation has not built up a detectable optical counterpart .      to answer whether or not significant uv - detected star formation occurs in the optical outer - disk region , irrespective of extent beyond @xmath24",
    ", we construct a second quantitative classification .",
    "we designate a population with a @xmath2910% young component by mass as one containing `` significant '' star formation ( in practice for our model set @xmath258% ,  3.2.1 ) . considering the aforementioned stellar population model grid ,",

    "the properties and demographics of the uv - b disks are presented in  5 ( see also table 2 ) from which we conclude that these galaxies correlate well with enhanced optical disk star formation .",

    "relative to the older populations traced by near - ir light , the average radial extent of the young xuv - disk component in our e / s0s is @xmath02 times the @xmath21 radius . relative to the centralized younger populations traced by nuv light ,",

    "[ hink ] ) , with 0.1% kolmogorov - smirnov test probability of the same @xmath51/@xmath6@xmath15 distribution .",
    "thus , it appears that uv - b disks are closely linked to significant star formation potential and pronounced optical outer - disk star formation .",
    "in this section , we compare our identified xuv- and uv - b disk galaxy properties and demographics to xuv - disk and early - type galaxy formation scenarios and related literature results .",
    "we note , however , that uniform knowledge of the local and global environments of our sample galaxies would be necessary to constrain these formation scenarios and that uniform environmental data are not available for our sample .",
    "thus , study of the environmental properties of such galaxies is deferred to future work .",
    "xuv and uv - b disks occur in our sample with individually high , approximately 40% frequencies , and a combined frequency of 61@xmath29% .",
    "compared to classical `` red and dead '' expectations for early - type galaxies , the high incidence of apparent extended star formation we observe in xuv disks , with @xmath070% extending beyond the optical @xmath5 , is in itself a surprising result and may provide evidence against e / s0 formation through quenching processes in the low - mass , largely field regime we sample . moreover , that we observe a similarly high incidence of uv - b disks , which seem to relate more closely to _ significant _ star formation , and that _ all _ extend past @xmath5 is even more remarkable . in addition , although differences in samples and definitions complicate comparisons of absolute xuv - disk frequencies , it is intriguing that we find a frequency approximately twice the @xmath020% reported in late types by t07 ( see also @xcite ) .    one possible explanation for the high incidence of xuv disks we observe in e / s0s could be a formation channel that involves mergers .",
    "fallback of tidal tails in the late stages of a merger that is major enough to produce a spheroid is a likely scenario for creating new extended disks ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "early type galaxies at low luminosities / masses are largely `` fast rotators '' ( as per the @xcite terminology ) , displaying disk - like dynamics reflecting the importance of gas in mergers related to their formation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; kgb ) .",
    "thus , if such mergers often form xuv disks , the high frequency we observe in our mass regime could be a natural consequence .",
    "another possible explanation for the high xuv - disk incidence in early types compared to late types , related to the inferred weak nature of xuv - disk star formation (  6.3 ) , could be a bias due to the relative ease of detecting small star formation events in e / s0s .",
    "such events may have a more detectable impact on the appearances / properties of early types than late types , where they may be obscured by generally higher levels of star formation .",
    "the widespread distribution of the xuv disks in color and stellar mass seems to suggest an association with evolutionary processes affecting the galaxy population broadly .",
    "a potential scenario for creating extended , star - forming disks around early types is external acquisition of extended gas , whether delivered by companion interactions or fresh cosmic gas accretion , and subsequent conversion of this gas to stars . in early - type galaxies , such extended disks or rings of hi",
    "are frequently observed and often believed to be associated with external accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "t07 find that @xmath075% of their type  1 xuv disks show evidence for interactions or minor perturbations .",
    "an interaction scenario could explain the widespread demographics of xuvs in our e / s0s , especially since the xuvs we identify using the original t07 definition , which favors discovery of the weakest xuvs , are the most broadly distributed ( fig .",
    "[ 3pan ] ) . to confirm such an association , more complete knowledge of the companion statistics of our sample would be needed .",
    "for uv - b disks , which appear to have a somewhat mass - dependent distribution , the higher uv - b disk frequency at low masses ( below @xmath46 ) could hint at a gas delivery mechanism with a preferred mass scale , as in the cold - accretion scenario ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , an in - depth examination of the environments and group properties of a larger , statistical sample of such galaxies will be necessary to distinguish between various scenarios for producing extended star formation in early types .      an important question to ask about the apparently young uv disks we observe around e",
    "/ s0s is : are they actually associated with substantial disk growth ?",
    "the higher ( @xmath040% ) frequency of xuvs in both red- and blue - sequence e / s0s vs.  in late types seems to link xuv disks to a galaxy population associated with weak or inefficient star formation .",
    "moreover , our e / s0 xuv disks do not show an association with blue optical outer - disk colors , nor with enhanced hi content ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "the association of xuv disks with weak or inefficient star formation is consistent with the observation of a high ( @xmath070% ) rate of xuv disks in massive optically low surface brightness galaxies , which are known for inefficient star formation as well @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with t07 s result associating _ lower _ sfr/@xmath51 with type  1 xuv disks .",
    "in addition , simulations of xuv disks in spiral galaxies show that star formation in these objects can proceed for as long as 4 gyr without producing enough stars to create a high surface brightness optical component @xcite .",
    "in contrast , although xuv and uv - b classifications overlap , our uv - b disk galaxies as a class are characterized by bluer optical outer - disk colors and larger reservoirs of hi gas than e / s0s without uv - b disks ( see  4.4 ) .",
    "thus , uv - b disks are more closely associated with significant disk star formation than are xuv disks .",
    "in addition , if we consider the blue sequence below @xmath46 , where the numbers and properties of e / s0s suggest disk building is most active ( kgb ) , we find all sample galaxies save one are classified as uv - b disks ( fig .  [ 3pan ] ) . this strong link between uv - b disks and the sub-@xmath46 blue sequence seems to support the scenario of significant growth in the optical outer disks of e / s0s in this regime .",
    "we have used uv , optical , and ir imaging to study extended - disk star formation in a sample of 38 red- and blue - sequence e / s0s in the stellar mass regime below @xmath0@xmath52 and in primarily field environments .",
    "we introduce two new classifications : a _ purely quantitative version of the extended ultraviolet ( xuv ) disk classification _ , akin to the type  1 xuv definition of thilker et al .",
    "( 2007 ; t07 ) ; and an _ ultraviolet - bright ( uv - b ) disk classification _ , with nuv@xmath27 color indicating @xmath2910% young population in the outer optical disk beyond the 50% light radius .",
    "we summarize key results from the application of these classifications below .",
    "* we identify a high 61@xmath29% combined frequency of xuv and uv - b disks .",
    "since the classifications partially overlap , this frequency reduces to separate 39@xmath29% and 42@xmath3% frequencies for xuv disks and uv - b disks , respectively . in the xuv - disk case , the observed frequency is approximately twice the @xmath020% reported by t07 for primarily late - type galaxies , although differences in xuv - disk criteria and possible detection biases could affect this comparison .",
    "* uv colors of both xuv and uv - b disks typically imply @xmath41 gyr ages , and most of the identified uv disks extend beyond the optical @xmath5 radius .",
    "* xuv - disk host galaxies occupy a widespread distribution in color and stellar mass , while uv - b disks more strongly prefer the blue sequence and may also prefer the low - mass regime . *",
    "xuv disks appear to be associated with _ low - level _ star formation , whereas uv - b disks appear to be more clearly associated with _",
    "significant _ star formation .",
    "uv - b disk galaxies are also closely linked to the population of blue - sequence e / s0s in the stellar mass regime below the `` gas - richness threshold mass '' at @xmath6@xmath7 @xmath0 @xmath12 ( @xcite ; kgb ) , supporting the idea that such galaxies represent an actively disk - building population ( kgb ) .",
    "our results suggest that xuv - disk formation could be related to a process that affects the galaxy population broadly , such as interactions , while uv - b disk formation could be related to a process with a mass - scale preference , such as cold - mode gas accretion .",
    "existing data do not yet allow us to disentangle such effects in the e / s0 population , but the purely quantitative classifications we have developed in this work are well suited to application in larger statistical samples , which will allow us to construct a more complete picture of the local and global environments of star - forming e / s0s . in subsequent work",
    ", we plan to combine quantitative metrics of both disk building and environment in a large volume - limited survey in order to constrain the origin and future evolution of star - forming e / s0s and further probe the intriguing possibility of early - to - late - type transformation .",
