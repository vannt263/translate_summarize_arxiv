    "one may write down similar expressions for all other constraints which _ in principle _ uniquely determine all extra transformations of the dependent fields .    in practice , to write down a solution for the extra transformations of the dependent fields , we solve the set of coupled equations for the extra transformations iteratively .",
    "namely , we make an expansion order by order in the number of independent fields , where one counts the vierbein as a kronecker delta ( i.e. field number zero ) .",
