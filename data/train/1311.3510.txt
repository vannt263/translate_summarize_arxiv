    "when people were exciting for the found of higgs - like particle with about 125gev mass at the lhc , we have to worry about the survival of new physics ( np ) right away .",
    "almost all experiments are proving the standard model ( sm ) , the space left to np is less and less .",
    "there is an impending question we are dying to know that how much space can np survive .",
    "it is a good checking point to choose a neutral gauge boson , which often appears in gut and superstring model associated with @xmath0 group , as a popular candidate of np beyond the sm .",
    "there are many relative issues summarized by a. leike and p. langacker @xcite .",
    "however , duo to different motivations , @xmath7 interactions to the sm fermions is set by models , which makes the results are highly model - dependent .",
    "the minimal mass of the vector boson is limited at about @xmath10 tev . in the paper , we relax any possible motivations and roles coming from underlying theory or phenomenology , and construct a model - independent effective lagrangian to describe @xmath0 gauge boson @xmath7 only following the requirement of gauge symmetry . in bosonic sector , all possible mass and kinetic mixings meeting gauge symmetry are investigated . and in fermionic sector , anomaly - free charge assignments is required to satisfy gauge symmetry . the interactions to fermions are dominated by a global coupling @xmath5 and a charge assignment parameter @xmath4 .",
    "they are keys to realize model - independent description .",
    "we consider constrains from not only electroweak precise observables but also direct detection at lhc , and then decide the possible parameter space left to the simplest np particle .",
    "the article is organized as following : firstly , anomaly - free @xmath7 effective lagrangian is constructed .",
    "and then , we diagonalize gauge bosons mixing matrixes to obtain mass eigenvalues of neutral bosons .",
    "the limit to parameters is studied based on electroweak precise measurements in lep and direct search at the lhc at @xmath1 tev .",
    "the allowed area is shown in @xmath6-@xmath5 plane . finally , the possible signal in dilepton final states at @xmath9 tev at the lhc is predicted .",
    "to construct - independent @xmath7 effective theory , we will focus on parameterizations in @xmath7 mixings and interactions . denote @xmath0 gauge eigenstate as @xmath11 . on gauge eigenstates base @xmath12 , the covariant derivative has the form @xmath13 here",
    ", @xmath14 is non - linear realization of goldstone bosons . @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively gauge field of @xmath17 and @xmath18 with gauge coupling @xmath19 and @xmath20 . using @xmath17 covariant building blocks @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    ", mass terms arise from 4 operators in @xmath23 order : @xmath24,tr[tv_\\mu]^2,tr[v_\\mu]^2 $ ] and @xmath25tr[v^\\mu]$ ] .",
    "the first operator corresponds to the electroweak standard model .",
    "the second one provides an extra mass correction to isospin third - component @xmath26 .",
    "the third one generates non - standard mixing between @xmath16 and @xmath26 . and the last one parameterizes @xmath2-@xmath7 mixing .",
    "however , the second and third one can be absorbed in the re - definition of gauge couplings @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and are not independent @xcite .",
    "similarly , kinetic mixing terms are also controlled by 4 operators : @xmath27 ^ 2 $ ] , @xmath27b^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , @xmath27x^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the first operator corresponds a correction to @xmath29 kinetic term . the second one yields kinetic mixing between @xmath26 and @xmath16 .",
    "the third and forth ones cause @xmath0 boson @xmath11 kinetic mixings with @xmath26 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the first two operators are non - standard term beyond the sm and there is no any reason to neglect these invariant ones @xcite .    expressing these operators in obvious gauge fields ,",
    "lagrangian related to mixings is written as @xmath30 with mass mixing @xmath31 @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are @xmath2 and @xmath7 mass in gauge eigenstates and @xmath34 are sine and cosine of weinberg angle .",
    "to @xmath7 interactions to ew gauge bosons @xmath35 and @xmath2 , some independent parameters control them , which may come from underlying theory and not vanish even though no @xmath7 mixings .",
    "for example the decay channel @xmath36 may arise from @xmath2-@xmath7 mixing or high order operator @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "the former is suppressed by small @xmath2-@xmath7 mixing angle , and the later stands for possible np which has no any promption from high energy experiments . for the similar reason , all these decays of @xmath7 to ew bosons are expected to be small .",
    "the extra neutral current interaction is introduced like @xmath38 with left - handed ( right - handed ) fermionic @xmath0 charge @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) . to keep gauge symmetry",
    ", @xmath0 charge assignments must be anomaly - free .",
    "for the family universal case , there are 6 independent charges : @xmath41 and @xmath42 for left - handed leptons and quarks , @xmath43 for right - handed up - quark , down - quark , neutrino and electron , respectively . from @xmath44",

    "now , these couplings are dominated by two free parameters : coupling @xmath5 that controls global intensity and charge ratio @xmath52 that assigns flavor charges @xmath53    briefly , anomaly - free @xmath7 effective theory , inspired by @xmath0 gauge symmetry , can be parameterized by mass mixing @xmath31 , kinetic mixing @xmath54 in bosonic sector ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively parameterize non - standard @xmath57 and @xmath58 electroweak bososic kinetic mixing terms , which are not relative to @xmath7 boson ) , coupling @xmath5 and the charge ratio @xmath4 in fermionic sector .",
    "the full lagrangian for @xmath0 boson is @xmath59",
    "to obtain mass eigenstates , let s make a rotation @xmath60 @xmath61 to diagonalize mass and kinetic mixings simultaneously . considering rotation @xmath60 reducing to weinberg s rotation when no @xmath7 mixings , @xmath60 may be expressed as the sum of weinberg s rotation and @xmath7 mixing corrections @xmath62 notice that 9 @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) are not independent , they are determined by only 7 phenomenological parameters : mass @xmath33 and @xmath65 , mass mixing @xmath31 , and kinetic mixings @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "so , we must find two constraint conditions on @xmath68s .",
    "one is @xmath69 , which results from the requirement for a massless photon .",
    "another constraint is @xmath70 due to the requirement of keeping photon coupling vector - type @xcite .",
    "after the rotation ( [ umatrix ] ) , the mass eigenvalues of @xmath2 and @xmath7 are @xmath71",
    "due to the good fit of the sm to electroweak precise observables , @xmath7 effective theory must be constrained by precise electroweak experiments .",
    "the heavy neutral boson contributes to low energy observables by two fashions : mixings and @xmath7 exchange .",
    "they often coexist in phenomenology .",
    "however , corrections to fermionic couplings only come from mixings .",
    "a theoretical observables can be divided into the sm part and @xmath7 contribution @xmath72 due to the triumph of the sm , @xmath73 must be very small . generally , it s a safe precession to neglect high order effect of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "using rotation ( [ urotation ] ) , vector and axial - vector couplings in weak neutral current are given by @xmath74 @xmath75 is the sm couplings in tree level , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the effective couplings with radiative corrections to propagators and vertices in the sm can be found in lep report @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 corrections are @xmath78 @xmath7 corrections are constrained by @xmath2-pole observables .",
    "the validity of constraint depends on two factors : experiments precision and calculation precision based on the sm .",
    "although there are 14 observables in lep / sld at @xmath2-pole , the sm calculation can be parameterized into only 4 radiate correction factors : @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( or express into 4 new parameters @xmath81 introduced by altarelli , et.al .",
    "@xcite ) . considering the number of independent measurements in experiment and the sm calculation , it s a _ balanced treatment _ to choice pseudo observables , 8 effective coupling constants @xmath82 for @xmath83 , to limit @xmath7 parameters .",
    "we minimize @xmath84 where supercript @xmath85 , @xmath86 respectively denote the corresponding experiment values and the sm fit values , and @xmath87 are their experimental errors .",
    "the four free parameters are @xmath3 and @xmath4 . as we have mentioned , @xmath63 are the functions of mixing parameters",
    ". we must keep the fit parameters independent .",
    "it can be proved by calculating rotation matrixes invoked by mass mixing @xmath31 , and kinetic mixings @xmath88 , respectively , even if ew boson kinetic mixing @xmath89 and @xmath56 vanishing .",
