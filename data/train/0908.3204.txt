    "atomic and molecular interferometry experiments @xcite , precision measurements of fundamental constants @xcite and coherent control of molecular dynamics @xcite are based on gaseous ensembles of atoms or molecules prepared in coherent superpositions of internal ( electronic , ro - vibrational , hyperfine , stark or zeeman ) energy states .",
    "atoms and molecules in coherent superpositions of internal states have also been proposed as building blocks for quantum computation and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "coherent superpositions may be destroyed by external field fluctuations and collisions of gas particles .",
    "collision - induced decoherence is a major limiting factor in the experimental realization of quantum computation and coherent control of molecular dynamics .",
    "recent progress in the development of experimental techniques for cooling atoms and molecules to extremely low temperatures suggests new possibilities for precision spectroscopy measurements , coherent control of molecular processes and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "for example , cooling molecules to ultralow temperatures allows for high - resolution spectroscopy with long interrogation times and high degree of control over intra- and inter - molecular interactions @xcite .",
    "the translational energy of ultracold molecules is insignificant and can be disentangled from internal states , which can be exploited to develop new schemes for coherent control @xcite",
    ". however , elastic and inelastic collisions of atoms and molecules at ultralow temperatures may be very efficient , leading to significant decoherence rates @xcite . in order to assess the feasibility of quantum information processing , quantum interferometry measurements and coherent control schemes based on ultracold atom and molecules",
    ", it is necessary to develop a microsopic theory of collisional decoherence of internal state superpositions at ultralow temperatures .",
    "a master equation describing decoherence of translational and internal states for a tracer molecule in an inert gas has been derived heuristically by hornberger and vacchini @xcite , and the brownian motion limit of an infinitely massive tracer particle was considered by hornberger @xcite .",
    "this latter result was applied to decoherence of enantiomeric states of optically active molecules to explain hund s paradox , i.e.  the well - known observation that chiral molecules are not naturally found in their achiral ground state @xcite .",
    "although coherence in the tracer molecule s state in general may involve both translational and internal degrees of freedom , in many experiments a substantial simplification arises because the translational degrees of freedom are fully decohered .",
    "internal state decoherence in this simplified case was studied by vacchini @xcite .",
    "whether or not the translational degrees of freedom are fully decohered , coherences between internal states typically depend on the translational degrees of freedom .",
    "for an experiment in which only the internal state is probed , the appropriate statistical operator is a reduced density matrix acting on the internal state space , which is obtained by tracing over the translational degrees of freedom . as a consequence ,",
    "the evolution of the internal state is typically non - markovian and the time dependence of the internal state coherence is generally non - exponential @xcite .",
    "the theory of collisional decoherence for a tracer particle with internal states is an extension of the analysis of positional decoherence for a tracer particle without internal states .",
    "this problem has been studied in detail @xcite , particularly in the brownian motion limit of an infinitely massive tracer particle . hornberger and sipe",
    "presented a solution for the brownian motion limit using a convex decomposition of the bath gas density matrix into localized wavepackets to avoid mathematical problems arising because momentum eigenvectors are not normalizable @xcite .",
    "this rigorous method can be used to develop formal replacement rules for consistently handling the singular quantities in the momentum basis .",
    "the replacement rule method was extended to the case of a tracer particle with finite mass @xcite .",
    "adler connected the replacement rules to the method used to resolve the squared dirac delta function appearing in the golden rule derivation @xcite .    other work on collisional decoherence of internal state superpositions has included investigation of decoherence suppression using optical pulses @xcite and approaches based on monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "an analysis by reinhold and co - workers predicted that measurements of decoherence - induced damping of quantum beats could be used as a sensitive probe of collision cross - sections @xcite .",
    "ramakrishna and seideman investigated decoherence of rotational wavepackets using an approach applicable for dense media @xcite .",
    "this method treats the translational degrees of freedom phenomenologically",
    ". they also found that damping of coherent oscillations and relaxation in the molecular alignment may provide information about elastic and inelastic collision properties .",
    "in this paper we consider decoherence of internal state superpositions for a tracer molecule in the presence of an ultracold buffer gas in a trap .",
    "this process can be studied in buffer gas cooling experiments  an important class of experiments for the creation of ultracold molecules and precision spectroscopy @xcite  by creating molecular wavepackets or in sympathetic cooling experiments using magneto - optical traps @xcite .",
    "the separation between internal energy levels of molecules is typically large compared to ultracold trap depths @xcite . as a consequence , inelastic collisions , in which the internal state of the molecule is changed , release enough energy from internal states into translational motion that both the tracer molecule and the buffer gas atoms involved in the collision are ejected from the trap .",
    "the experiments begin with the translational degrees of freedom of the buffer gas and tracer molecule fully decohered and in thermal equilibrium at the buffer gas temperature .",
    "it will be shown that the translational degrees of freedom remain fully decohered throughout the experiment . at @xmath0",
    "the tracer molecules are prepared in a coherent superposition of internal states .",
    "we obtain expressions for the coherence present between internal states over time during the experiment in the limit of ultracold temperatures and in the limit of a small but finite buffer gas / tracer molecule mass ratio .",
    "these expressions give the temperature dependence of the decoherence rate at ultracold temperatures in terms of the @xmath1-wave scattering parameters for collisions between the buffer gas particles and the tracer molecules in the different internal states .",
    "the number of trapped molecules in experiments with ultracold gases is continually decreasing due to inelastic trap loss .",
    "there are different measures of coherence between internal states that may be of interest depending on the experiment . in quantum computation ,",
    "for example , the total strength of the coherent signal relative to the size of the initial ensemble may be important .",
    "in contrast , for an experiment which is observing coherent oscillations arising from interference between internal states , the quantity of interest may be coherence within the trapped collection of molecules , and the decreasing size of the trapped population may be irrelevant .",
    "we derive two different measures of internal state coherence appropriate to each of these experimental scenarios and find the temperature dependence of the decoherence rate at ultracold temperatures .",
    "our analysis is based on the replacement rule approach of hornberger , sipe and adler @xcite .",
    "it is related to the work of hornberger in ref .",
    "@xcite which provides a general theory of collisional decoherence of internal states with translational degrees of freedom fully decohered .",
    "our analysis differs from ref .",
    "@xcite in that we incorporate the presence of inelastic trap loss to model experiments in ultracold traps , and we consider a particular limit of low temperatures .",
    "our results suggest a method for determining scattering lengths of molecules in different states based on low - temperature measurements of the temperature dependence of decoherence - induced damping of coherent oscillations .",
    "we consider an ensemble of atoms or molecules of mass @xmath2 prepared at time @xmath0 in an internal state characterized by a reduced density matrix with elements @xmath3 and placed in a bath of ultracold atoms of mass @xmath4 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath5 denotes an internal energy eigenstate with energy @xmath6 .",
    "the initial internal state may be pure or mixed .",
    "if there is initially coherence present between internal energy eigenstates , decoherence occurs as a result of collisions with buffer gas atoms .",
    "the goal of this work is to calculate the time evolution of the coherence between internal states @xmath5 and @xmath7 using the measures of coherence defined in sec .  [ sec : measures ] .",
    "we make the following assumptions to model the conditions of experiments with ultracold gases :    \\1 ) at @xmath0 the bath particles and the tracer particle translational degrees of freedom are in thermal equilibrium at the ultracold temperature @xmath8 .",
    "\\2 ) the tracer particle internal states @xmath9 are nondegenerate .",
    "\\3 ) the buffer gas is sufficiently dilute that the time between collisions is long compared to the duration of a collision .",
    "this implies that we can neglect collisions involving three or more particles .",
    "\\4 ) the energy difference between the internal energy levels of the tracer particle is large compared to the trap depth . as a consequence ,",
    "inelastic collisions transfer enough internal energy to translational motion to eject both the tracer particle and the buffer gas particle involved in the collision from the trap .",
    "\\5 ) the collisions between buffer gas particles keep them in thermal equilibrium .",
    "in addition , the previous assumption implies that there is no heating of the trapped buffer gas due to inelastic conditions . as a result",
    ", we may treat the buffer gas particle in every collision as being drawn from the thermal equilibrium ensemble at temperature @xmath8 which does not change in time .",
    "\\6 ) the trapping potential is ignored : the trapped gas is treated as a uniform gas in free space .",
    "this is a good approximation since trap dimensions are large compared to relevant length scales for collisions and gas properties typically vary slowly in space .",
    "the tracer particle state at time @xmath10 is represented by the reduced density operator @xmath11 with matrix elements @xmath12 in the momentum and internal state basis .",

    "the internal state space of the tracer particle is @xmath20 .",
    "the state spaces for the relative translational motion of the colliding pair and the motion of the center of mass are respectively @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",

    "the incoming and outgoing asymptotic trajectories are related by the two - particle scattering operator @xmath34 according to @xcite @xmath35 the duration of a collision is short compared to the time scales of the experiments .",
    "we may thus regard a collision occurring at time @xmath36 as an effectively instantaneous transition between the asymptotic trajectories @xmath37 .",
    "the second equality is valid because the @xmath34 operator commutes with @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "if the incoming two - particle state is a mixed state described by a density operator @xmath38 , then the state after the collision is given by the density operator @xmath39 the reduced one particle density operator for the tracer particle state after the collision is obtained by tracing over the degrees of freedom of the bath particle , @xmath40    a collision will entangle the states of the tracer particle with the buffer gas particle .",
    "however , we are interested in describing the ensemble of tracer particles only .",
    "this is sufficient for the description of most experiments which do not probe entanglement between the tracer particles and the bath .",
    "it is possible that the tracer particle may encounter the same bath particle more than once but the bath particle will have undergone further collisions entangling its state with those of other bath particles .",
    "there is no mechanism which can systematically maintain coherence between the tracer particle and the gas particle state between successive encounters of the same particles .",
    "thus , for each collision we may treat the two - particle state of the colliding pair as the separable state @xmath41 , and the tracer particle state after the collision is given in terms of the incoming state @xmath42 by @xmath43 \\label{eq : hatrhodef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the two - particle scattering operator which acts on the space @xmath44 , and @xmath45 indicates the trace over the buffer gas particle degrees of freedom .",
