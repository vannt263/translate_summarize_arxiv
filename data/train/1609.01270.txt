    "the deformation of the integration contour is allowed only as long as the poles are not crossed , and the integrand has a pole whenever @xmath41 ( we note that the denominator in   is @xmath161 , the negative resource surplus of species @xmath15 ) . thus in our @xmath4-dimensional",

    "in expression  , the exponential term @xmath165 dominates the integrand everywhere , except in the immediate vicinity of the region boundary where @xmath166 diverges .",
    "if @xmath148 is large , but finite , the extremum is achieved at a point @xmath167 lying strictly inside the region @xmath31 , at a distance of order @xmath168 from the nearest bounding hyperplanes . in this `` finite temperature '' regime ,",
    "all species @xmath7 have non - zero abundance : since @xmath7 enters into @xmath151 as @xmath169 , the observables @xmath7 follow an exponential distribution with mean @xmath170 .",
    "in the zero - temperature limit ( @xmath171 ) , this expected abundance vanishes for all species except a select few , for which @xmath17 is precisely zero .",

    "<S> this community constitutes an example of the s - phase , where the immediate environment of individuals is fully `` * * s**hielded '' from external conditions : faced with an uneven resource supply , species abundance will adjust to drive resource availability to @xmath55 for all @xmath10 , restoring symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in general , a restricted set of species ( small @xmath69 ) or a strongly heterogeneous resource supply ( large @xmath71 ) will prevent the community from exactly matching demand to the uneven supply , and the externally imposed asymmetry between resources will propagate into the organisms actual environment @xmath28 ( the v - phase , `` * * v**ulnerable '' to external perturbations ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , as the community is exposed to new species ( @xmath69 is increased above the critical value ; the arrow in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phases]a ) , the community transitions into the shielded phase where the environment @xmath28 is fully symmetric ( @xmath86 ) and insensitive to external conditions .    to confirm this interpretation , </S>",
    "<S> consider the number of coexisting species at equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> as we have seen , geometrically , this number is the co - dimension ( @xmath4 minus the dimension ) of the region of @xmath36 where the equilibrium is located . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , this elusive quantity can also be computed analytically . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , one can compute the distribution of the resource surplus @xmath87 of all @xmath88 species at equilibrium ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phases]b ; see si ) : @xmath89 here @xmath90 is the heaviside function constraining @xmath87 to be negative . </S>",
    "<S> the delta - shaped peak at @xmath91 represents the fraction of species whose resource demand is met . </S>",
    "<S> the number of survivors is therefore @xmath92 , in excellent agreement with simulations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phases]c ) . the s - phase where @xmath93 therefore harbors a complete set of exactly @xmath4 species . </S>",
    "<S> if the perturbation of external conditions is small , no species will go extinct . </S>",
    "<S> since the vectors @xmath9 and @xmath12 ( @xmath15 running over @xmath4 surviving species ) are related by a full - rank matrix @xmath14 , this means that the resource availability at the new equilibrium will remain exactly the same , confirming our interpretation of this `` shielded '' phase .    , the phase transition is replaced by a crossover . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical curves are overlaid with simulation datapoints for a range of @xmath69 ( 10 instances each ) . at large @xmath69 , we observe @xmath94 , confirming that the fluctuations of @xmath9 become negligible . * </S>",
    "<S> b. * the qualitative distinction between phases persists at finite @xmath51 . here </S>",
    "<S> , simulation results are shown for @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> a community faces a bimodal supply of @xmath82 resources ( upper panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> lower panel shows the equilibrium availability of resources @xmath9 ( mean @xmath96 1 standard deviation over 500 instances ) , for two values of @xmath69 corresponding to different phases ( highlighted in panel a ) . in the `` shielded '' s - phase , the asymmetry of the external supply does not affect resource availability @xmath9.[fig : cross ] ]    for a non - zero @xmath51 , the strict phase transition is replaced by a crossover ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cross]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the role of @xmath51 in our model is to measure how strongly a species fate is influenced by intrinsic , rather than environment - dependent ( ecological ) factors  @xcite . for large @xmath51 , community structure is no longer shaped by interactions between community members , but becomes dominated by species who outperform others in all circumstances , and the environmental feedback studied here becomes irrelevant . for small @xmath51 , however , the distinct features of the `` shielded '' and `` vulnerable '' phases remain clearly recognizable : the fluctuations of resource availability are , respectively , of order @xmath51 or much larger than @xmath51 ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : cross]b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> this result has intriguing implications . </S>",
    "<S> consider a community facing the strongly uneven resource supply shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cross]b ( top panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> define a species individual performance as its growth rate when placed in this environment , with no other organisms present . </S>",
    "<S> one might expect this performance metric to be predictive of species survival in a community setting : surely , increasing the supply of maltose to a community should favor organisms that grow well on maltose . in the more intuitive v - phase </S>",
    "<S> , this expectation is indeed correct . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the s - phase the internal environment becomes a collective property governed by the statistical properties of the species pool , rather than by the external conditions ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cross]b ; bottom panel ) . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the performance measured in external conditions becomes irrelevant : it no longer predicts whether a species will survive ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : sxxphases ] ) .    in ecological terms , the model considered here was purely competitive : increasing the abundance of any species reduces the growth rates of everyone else , i.e.  there are no `` cooperative interactions '' . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we have shown that at high dimension , the parameter space of this classic resource competition model contains a strongly collective regime .    </S>",
    "<S> these conclusions were drawn in the context of a particular , highly simplified model . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , our analysis ignored spatial structure , assumed deterministic dynamics , and considered the equilibrium states only . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that natural communities are never in steady state , and stochasticity and spatial structure are tremendously important in most contexts . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the goal of this work was to explore specifically the feedback of organisms onto their environment and identify the implications of large dimensionality . for this purpose , the simplified model adopted here </S>",
    "<S> provides a convenient starting point , and highlights the promise of applying statistical physics to gain analytical insight into the non - intuitive phenomenology of large - dimensional networks  @xcite and highly diverse ecosystems .    </S>",
