    "this multiphoton electron - positron pair production has been observed experimentally at the stanford linear accelerator center ( slac ) @xcite in collisions of a high energy electron beam with a terawatt laser pulse .",
    "however , the electron beam energy was not sufficient for the first order bw process .    the slac experiment consisted in injecting a beam of @xmath10 electrons with an energy of 46.6gev into an intense laser beam with a relativistic amplitude @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the electron mass and @xmath13 is the light velocity , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the laser electric field amplitude and frequency .",
    "it was a two step process .",
    "at the first step , the laser photons with an energy @xmath16ev , where @xmath17 is the planck constant , were converted in @xmath18gev @xmath0-rays in the linear and nonlinear compton backscattering processes @xmath19 with @xmath20-@xmath21 @xcite . approximately @xmath22 high energy photons per shot have been produced . at the second step ,",
    "these high  energy photons were collided with the laser photons producing pairs @xmath23 . although the probability of this process was very low , the authors observed about 100 positrons in 20000 laser shots . according to the energy conservation , at least four optical photons , @xmath24 ,",
    "were needed for this non  linear bw process . in this configuration , colliding with an optical laser beam the first order bw process would require 200gev photons .",
    "observation of the bw process is difficult because of other pair  production reactions in charged particle collisions .",
    "the major competing processes are : the electrons collision with a nucleus , @xmath25 , the so called `` trident '' process , with the effective cross section @xmath26 and the bethe  heitler process @xcite @xmath27 , which has a larger cross section @xmath28 . here",
    ", @xmath29 is the fine structure constant .",
    "both processes are efficient for the positron production with intense laser pulses and high  z targets @xcite .",
    "however , they introduce strong limitations on the noise level for detecting the bw process .",
    "experiments carried out on the jupiter and omega ep laser facilities @xcite showed production of @xmath30 positrons per shot from a thick gold target irradiated with a laser pulse having intensity @xmath31 w/@xmath4 . recently , on the astra  gemini laser facility , a high  density ( @xmath32 @xmath33 ) and small divergence ( 1020 mrad ) positron beam has been created , by a high intensity laser beam irradiating a gas target and using a secondary high  z target @xcite .",
    "these examples illustrate the difficulty in detecting the bw process , which requires a clean interaction environment excluding heavy materials and prefers a collision of intense and energetic photon beams in vacuum .    a possible experimental scheme for studies of the bw process was suggested recently by pike _",
    "the authors proposed to collide a gev photon beam with a bath of thermal photons at a temperature of @xmath34ev .",
    "the gev photons are supposed to be created in the bremsstrahlung process of laser accelerated electrons in a mm  thick gold target .",
    "laser intensities above @xmath35w/@xmath4 are required to accelerate electrons to gev energies , which then generate the photons .",
    "the thermal x  rays can be produced inside a high  z hohlraum with a separate laser pulse having energy of a few hundred kj .",
    "such an experimental configuration could be realized on the lmj or nif laser facilities @xcite coupled to the petawatt systems petal and arc , respectively .",
    "the authors expect a production of @xmath36 bw pairs in a single laser shot .",
    "however , the proposed scheme can not be operated with multiple laser shots , and it is prone to a high noise level due to the presence of a significant mass of heavy material .",
    "moreover , the authors of a recent study of the bremsstrahlung process on a petawatt laser facility with the intensity close to @xmath35w/@xmath4 @xcite reported a photon spectrum with a relatively low effective temperature of less than 10mev and a cut  off energy below 100mev .",
    "the softening of the photon spectrum is explained by an efficient creation of secondary electrons in the gold target .",
    "these observations demonstrate the difficulty to create an efficient gev photon source based on the bremsstrahlung process .    in this paper , we propose another experimental approach for the observation of the bw process .",
    "the scheme relies on the collision of two relatively low energy ( few mev ) , intense photon beams .",

    "we provide details of the experimental setup , analytical estimates and numerical simulations of the expected yield of reactions and possible ways to create a photon source with requested parameters .",

    "the appropriate choice of photons depends on the available sources . in the slac experiment with a laser delivering @xmath42ev photons in a very short pulse of @xmath43fs ,",
    "one would need a counterpart source of a few hundred gev photons .",

    "scale linear accelerators , which are major facilities requiring rather expensive preparation campaigns .",
    "moreover , with expected number of compton photons @xmath44 , the probability of the bw process remains very small , which does not allow the direct bw process observation .",
    "cross section @xmath45 versus @xmath46 and @xmath46 near the threshold for @xmath40.,width=377 ]    another known source of intense photons is a hohlraum heated by a high energy laser pulse @xcite . while delivering a laser energy of a few hundred kj inside a mm  size gold cavity",
    ", one can create a black body  like radiation with the effective temperature of @xmath47ev @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a very significant number of photons @xmath31 confined in a millimeter ",
    "size volume on a nanosecond time scale .",
    "the counterpart photon source is then in the gev range , which can be created today in the laboratory  scale laser installations @xcite .",
    "however , this scheme @xcite , apart of making the photon interaction in a harsh hohlraum environment , faces another challenge in producing an efficient gev photon source .",
    "although several approaches could be considered @xcite , none of them is demonstrated today , and it would be difficult to make a valid prediction of how efficient such a source could be .",
    "it is much easier to produce lower energy photons in a few mev range . according to eq .",
    ", a collision of two such photon beams at a large angle could produce the electron  positron pairs .",
    "this is the basis of our scheme to demonstrate the bw process : a collision of two identical mev  photon beams .",
    "pairs production is analytically estimated in two different cases : ( i ) gev photon with thermal photons bath @xcite and ( ii ) mev  mev photon collision .",

    "the total number of generated pairs , @xmath66 is proportional to the number of photons @xmath67 and the propagation length @xmath68 .",
    "then for @xmath69 cm and @xmath70 , one expects between @xmath71 and @xmath72 pairs per shot in that temperature range .",
    "the lowest pair number could be small compared to the expected noise level .",
    "moreover , in the analysis of pairs production in a 1 gev photon interaction with thermal photon in a high  z hohlraum one has to take into account that all pairs are generated inside the hohlraum and their detection could be difficult .",
    "the authors @xcite estimate @xmath73ev ( @xmath74 ) as a figure of merit for such an experiment .",
    "another important parameter is the intensity of the gev photon source : one needs a reliable source of @xmath75 photons per shot , or approximately 0.1j in a bunch , which is quite challenging .    in the case",
    "( ii ) , the use of mev photons allows to reduce significantly the requirements on the photon source for a bw experiment . assuming two conical @xmath0 beams with a divergence angle @xmath76 ( half angle of the full divergence ) intersecting at an angle @xmath38 ,",
    "the interaction volume will be @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the pulse length , @xmath79 is the pulse duration and @xmath80 is the distance between the target and the collision zone . we suppose that @xmath80 is much greater than the focal spot radius .",
    "the number of pairs can be estimated as @xmath81 $ ] , where @xmath82 is the total number of photons in the bunch .",
    "taking for the estimate the maximum value for the cross section ( [ eq2 ] ) the number of pairs , for 1mev beams and for @xmath83 reads @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the photon beam energy in joules and @xmath80 is the interaction distance in @xmath86 m .",
    "therefore , two beams having an energy of 110j each , with a beam divergence angle @xmath87 and an interaction distance of @xmath88 m will produce in average @xmath89 pairs per shot .",
    "a source producing in average 2j photon bunches with an effective temperature of 6mev is already available @xcite .",
    "moreover , mev photon bunches could be created routinely in the new generation of 10pw laser facilities under construction in the framework of the eli @xcite and apollon @xcite projects .",
    "the schematic experimental setup is shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "two photon beams are created from thin foils irradiated with laser pulses at an high intensity of @xmath90 w/@xmath4 .",
