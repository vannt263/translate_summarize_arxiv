    "notice that the boson self - energy is independent of the uv cutoff which signal a novel quantum criticality in our system .",

    "we notice that the instantaneous nature of the coulomb propagator enforces no vertex correction through the ward identity .",
    "therefore , the rg flow equations , i.e. , beta functions , for @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be derived by changing the ratio , @xmath56 , @xmath57 near the strong - coupling fixed point .",
    "it is clear from the rg equations that the fine structure constant @xmath55 decreases with the anomalous dimension of the velocity , @xmath58 .",
    "this concludes that the strong - coupling fixed point is _",
    "unstable_.    our controlled analysis near the two extreme limits ( standard perturbation and large-@xmath39 analysis ) clearly shows that both the fixed points are unstable .",
    "then it is obvious that the stable fixed point should be in the intermediate regime , which is difficult to access in a fully controlled way .",

    "such large anomalous dimension indicates that the momentum - shell rg is not controlled and _ a priori _ not reliable .    at the stable fixed point ,",
    "the effective bosonic action becomes @xmath78 which is very similar to the large-@xmath39 calculation with one important difference ; a new coupling constant ( @xmath79 ) with uv cutoff scale naturally enters in contrast to the large-@xmath39 calculation where the coefficient of @xmath80 is @xmath81 ( see equation ) which depends on the other parameters @xmath82 . here",
    "the new dimensionful parameter @xmath79 appears in the bosonic part at the intermediate coupling regime .    with this intuition in hand",
    ", we investigate the stability of the new fixed point by taking equation as the bare boson action and performing the momentum - shell rg near this fixed point .",
    "remarkably , we find that the velocity @xmath54 and inverse mass @xmath11 receives the same corrections at the fixed point @xmath83 the same correction is another evidence for our fixed point to be stable since the ratio @xmath84 appearing in the boson self - energy @xmath34 becomes constant .",
    "notice that the remarkable same correction also appears in fermi surface quantum criticalities with very different physical reasons which also supports stability of our fixed point@xcite .",
    "it is manifest that the gapless excitation structure of our system is completely different from that of fermi surfaces ( lines ) in 2d .",
    "only nodal point excitation appears in our system .",
    "however , the low energy scaling structures of the two systems are same considering the patch theory of fermi surfaces in 2d ; one momentum direction has linear scaling while the other one has quadratic scaling .",
    "we believe this unexpected similarity is the source of the similar behaviors in the beta functions",
    ". it would be very intriguing to find more similarity and difference of two systems quantum criticalities , which we leave for future work .",
    "the beta functions around the novel fixed point are @xmath85 where @xmath86 calculated in the supplementary information v.     we remark that the hard momentum cutoff scheme is only used for simplicity and illustration . it is shown that our results are independent of cutoff schemes in the supplementary information viii .    the above rg flow structure is unique to this fixed point .",
    "the beta functions contain the fine structure constant @xmath55 in contrast to those of the large-@xmath39 calculation in which @xmath55 is absent , and here both @xmath87 receive the _ same _ logarithmic corrections , which are proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "thus , the fine structure constant @xmath55 decreases and the fermion only receives the logarithmic corrections , which indicates the fixed point is _ stable_. naturally , as in mono - layer graphene , marginal fermi liquid behaviors are expected with higher order corrections.@xcite    based on the calculations and intuitions , a schematic rg flow can be deduced as in fig .",
    "[ rgflow ] which summarizes our main results .",
    "our controlled calculation shows the non - interacting critical point ( non - int . ) and the strong coupled fixed point ( s ) are unstable and the rg flow comes out of the both points and flow into the intermediate fixed point ( qc ) , which is characterized by the definite anisotropic scaling of bosons and electrons and the single logarithmic corrections to velocity and inverse mass .     of the quantum criticality equation and",
    "the vertical axis is for the strength of coulomb interaction .",
    "there are two stable fixed points , insulators ( ` ins ' ) and dirac semimetal ( ` dirac ' ) .",
    "the two unstable critical points are illustrated with dashed circles , non - interacting ( ` non - int . ' ) and strong - coupling fixed point ( ` s ' ) . and the stable critical point is the filled circle ( ` qc ' ) .",

    "( ins , dirac , qc ) , one - particle spectrum with the coulomb interaction is illustrated .",
    "[ rgflow ] , width=576 ]",
    "we now investigate the physical consequences of both the anisotropy and marginal irrelevance of the renormalized coulomb potential at the novel intermediate critical point .",
    "first of all , with the beta functions of @xmath54 and @xmath11 , we can find logarithmic corrections to all physical quantities . the parameters @xmath88 at the temperature scale @xmath89",
    "are @xmath90 here @xmath91 is the bandwidth or the uv cutoff of the theory . @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the bare parameters at the highest energy scale @xmath94 .",
    "the logarithmic corrections in @xmath88 may be observed in quasi - particle experiments as in graphene , for example , angle resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite or quantum oscillation .    furthermore , thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and compressibility also show logarithmic corrections .",
    "specific heat and compressibility of the unstable free electron fixed point are @xmath95 and @xmath96 in which @xmath97 is the ( thermal - averaged ) energy density per volume as the function of temperature @xmath89 and @xmath98 is the density of the electron per volume as the function of chemical potential @xmath99 and temperature @xmath89 .",
    "but at the novel fixed point , the logarithmic corrections give @xmath100 at the temperature @xmath89 by following the reference@xcite .",
    "secondly , we can see the effect of the anisotropic renormalization of the gauge boson via the screening charge when a single impurity charge @xmath101 is introduced at @xmath102 . at the level of the linear response theory , the screening charge is @xmath103 , in which @xmath104 is the propagator of the gauge boson .",
    "we are interested in the _ directional _ behaviors of the screening charge and hence define the integrated screening charges @xmath105 and @xmath106 along @xmath67 and @xmath64 . here",
    "we will contrast the extremely different behaviors of the screening charges between the free fixed point and the non - trivial fixed point .    at the free fixed point",
    ", we ignore the corrections to the gauge boson propagator and use @xmath107 . following the straightforward calculation in supplementary information vi",
    ", we find @xmath108 whose sign is the opposite of the impurity charge @xmath101 .    on the other hand , at the non - trivial anisotropic fixed point in which we use the renormalized boson propagator @xmath109 , we find the asymptotic behaviors of the screening charges @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the uv cutoff . here",
    "the sign of the screening charge is the same as the impurity charge @xmath101 , which is reminiscent of graphene case@xcite .    from the above calculations",
    ", we see that the asymptotic scaling behaviors of the screening charges in distance from the impurity along @xmath67 and @xmath64 are surprisingly isotropic .",
    "the isotropic scaling in both the directions is originated from the facts that the scaling of @xmath112 is identical to that of @xmath113 and that @xmath114 at the energy scale @xmath99 receive the same logarithmic corrections as .",
    "hence this isotropic scaling behaviors are truly from the effects of interactions between the electrons and the gauge boson .",

    "affect each other , so the coulomb interaction mediated by the bosons becomes anisotropic and electrons receive back - reaction from the renormalized anisotropic coulomb interaction .",
    "thus , the coulomb interaction behaves differently from that of most critical systems where it enforces low - energy isotropy of electronic modes@xcite .",
    "also , notice that the ground state of our fixed point has marginally well - defined quasi - particles as those in graphene , which is in contrast to non - fermi liquids with non - zero anomalous dimensions . in table [",

    "however , as shown in the previous section , the screening charge due to the charged impurity , which can be measured in principle by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) , shows qualitatively isotropic behaviors .",
    "such discrepancy between the two experiments is a smoking gun of the novel quantum criticality in addition to thermodynamics quantities such as specific heat .",
    "it is worth to mention that disorder scattering in the non - interacting electrons is relevant@xcite , so our results work better for cleaner samples .",
