    "the problem of radiative gravitational collapse was first investigated by oppenheimer and snyder @xcite .",

    "the investigation of the gravitational behaviour of a collapsing star depends on the determination of the junction conditions matching the interior metric with the exterior vaidya metric across the boundary of the star .",

    "this toy model was generalised by rajah and maharaj @xcite by demonstrating solutions to a riccati boundary equation governing the gravitational behaviour .",
    "the general situation requires a model which is expanding , accelerating and shearing .",
    "noguiera and chan @xcite , modelling shear viscosity and bulk viscosity , attempted such a study but found that they needed to utilise numerical techniques to make progress . some recent progress has been made in finding exact models for euclidean stars by herrera and santos @xcite and govender _ et al _ @xcite . in euclidean stars with",

    "the stress tensor can be expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the radial pressure , @xmath25 is the tangential pressure and @xmath26 is a unit radial vector given by @xmath27 .",
    "the isotropic pressure @xmath28 relates the radial pressure and the tangential pressure .    for the line element ( [ eq : g1 ] ) and matter distribution ( [ eq : g3 ] ) the coupled einstein field equations become    @xmath29    where the heat flux @xmath30 has only the nonvanishing radial component .",
    "a comprehensive treatment of the effects of anisotropy with heat flow in general relativity was carried out by herrera _",
