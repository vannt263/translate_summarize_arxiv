    "the existence of phase transitions in the early universe has been a question that has preoccupied a generation of cosmologists .",
    "early on , kirzhnits @xcite found that the symmetry between the weak and electromagnetic interactions would be restored at high temperatures .",
    "this result was soon complemented by similar works by weinberg @xcite , dolan and jackiw @xcite , kirzhnits and linde @xcite .",
    "in particular , there has been much interest in the nature of the electroweak phase transition ( ewpt ) , which is closely related to the still unsolved problem of baryogenesis .",
    "it has been known since sakharov s work that there are three necessary ( but not sufficient ) conditions for the baryon asymmetry of the universe to develop @xcite . _ first _ , we need interactions that do not conserve baryon number b , otherwise no asymmetry could be produced in the first place .",
    "_ second _ , c and cp symmetry must be violated , in order to differentiate between matter and antimatter , otherwise the same rate of baryons and antibaryons would be produced leading to zero net baryon number . _",
    "third _ , the universe in his history , must have experienced a departure from thermal equilibrium . in other words ,",
    "the above @xmath8 and @xmath9 violating processes should have been occurred in a state out of equilibrium , otherwise the net baryon number can not change in time .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interaction meets all the above requirements to generate a baryon asymmetry during the ewpt , provided that this last be of first order .",
    "the type of symmetry restoring phase transition is determined by the behavior of the effective or thermodynamic potential .",
    "the fact that the symmetry is restored at high temperatures is a result of the @xmath10 term as the leading order contribution from the thermal fluctuations of the field .",
    "this term appears in the perturbatively calculable one - loop effective potential . here , @xmath11 is the temperature and @xmath12 is the mass squared proportional to the expectation value of some classical scalar ( higgs ) field @xmath13 . as the temperature",
    "is increased , the contribution from thermal fluctuation dominates the negative - mass - squared term in the tree level potential and symmetry will be restored . according to this one - loop approximation",
    ", it can be shown that the phase transition is of second order @xcite-@xcite and that the effective potential includes terms proportional to @xmath14 and therefore is imaginary when the mass squared is negative . as it was shown in @xcite",
    ", however , the appearance of imaginary terms in the one - loop effective potential indicates the breakdown of the semiclassical loop expansion through ir singularities .",
    "as it is then argued in @xcite , these ir singularities are included in the ring ( plasmon or daisy ) diagrams of the theory . in @xcite ,",
    "the nonperturbative ring contribution to the effective potential is calculated .",
    "it is shown to have the general structure @xmath15^{3/2}-m^{3}(v)\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the vacuum polarization in the _",
    "static ( zero momentum ) limit_. adding this contribution to the one - loop effective potential , it is then shown that the sm has indeed a first order phase transition and the critical temperature is much lower than the temperature arising from one - loop effective potential @xcite .",
    "as for the question of baryon asymmetry , however , it is known that neither the amount of cp violation within the minimal sm nor the strength of the ewpt are enough to generate sizable baryon number @xcite .    in the recent years , due to the observation that magnetic fields are able to generate a stronger first order ewpt @xcite-@xcite ,",
    "the electroweak baryogenesis is revisited within the minimal sm and in the presence of external hypermagnetic fields ( for a review see @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the ring improved effective potential of sm , including one - loop effective potential and ring contributions , is calculated explicitly . here , as in @xcite , the ring potential is determined in the _",
    "static ( zero momentum ) limit _ , where , in the presence of external magnetic field @xmath17 , @xmath18 in ( [ xx1 ] ) is defnined by @xmath19 .",
    "it is found that for the field strengths @xmath20 gau , the phase transition is of first order but the baryogenesis condition @xmath21 is still not satisfied .",
    ", the existence of baryon number violation is realized by means of its vacuum structure through sphaleron mediated processes .",
    "the sphaleron transition between different topological distinct vacua is associated to baryon number @xmath22 violation and can either induce or wash out a baryon asymmetry . in order to satisfy the baryon asymmetry condition during the baryogenesis process the rate of baryon violating transitions between different topological vacua must be suppressed in the broken phase , when the universe returns to thermal equilibrium . in other words , the sphaleron transitions must be slower than the expansion of the universe and this in turn translates into the condition @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the higgs mass @xcite . ] to improve this condition one is looking for possibilities to decrease the critical temperature @xmath25 of ewpt .    motivated by the previous facts and as the first step to improve the results in @xcite-@xcite to solve the problem of baryogenesis within the minimal sm , we will go in this paper _ beyond the static ( zero momentum ) limit _ and will calculate the ring improved effective potential of qed at finite temperature and in the presence of constant magnetic field in a certain _ ir limit_. as we have seen above , the ring part of the ring improved effective potential is given by qed vacuum polarization tensor , @xmath26 , at finite temperature . in this paper , in contrast to previous works , _",
    "@xcite , we will determine the ring potential using the vacuum polarization tensor in the _ ir limit _ , which is particularly characterized by @xmath27 .",
    "this paper consists of two parts : in the first part of the paper , using the diagonalized form of the vacuum polarization tensor in the ir limit @xmath28 , the general structure of the ring potential will be determined .",
    "then , the ring potential in the improved ir limit will be calculated explicitly in the presence of weak and strong magnetic field and the resulting expressions will be compared with the conventionally used static ring potential in these limits . in the second part of the paper , the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking of qed at finite temperature and in the presence of strong magnetic field will be studied .",
    "our main goal to study this example is to answer the question how efficient the improved ir approximation is in decreasing the critical temperature of the above dynamical chiral symmetry breaking . comparing the effect of the ring potential in the ir limit numerically with the effect of the ring potential in various static limits , we arrive at the conclusion that the improved ir limit is more efficient in decreasing the critical temperature arising from one - loop effective potential @xmath29 . here",
    ", @xmath29 is the critical temperature that arises from one - loop effective potential in the lowest order of @xmath6 correction ( ladder approximation ) . defining a ring improved critical temperature @xmath30 containing the contribution of one - loop effective potential in ladder approximation and the ring contributions",
    ", it turns out that the difference of the efficiency factors defined as @xmath31 is more than @xmath32 for the magnetic field @xmath33 gau .",
    "the above conclusion is promising in view of the problem of ewpt in the electroweak sm in the presence of weak / strong hypermagnetic field @xcite-@xcite . here",
    ", one is looking for a possibility to decrease the critical temperature of ewpt in order to improve the baryogenesis condition @xmath21 . using the improved ring potential in the ir limit in determining the critical temperature of ewpt in sm",

    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "i.b , we will review some technical details on ring diagrams in thermal field theory without magnetic field . in particular , we will review the well - known results of qed ring contribution to the effective potential in the static limit @xcite . in sect .",

    "iii.a and iii.b , the resulting ring improved effective potential in the ir limit will be considered first in the weak and then in the strong magnetic field limit .    in the weak magnetic field limit , at high temperature and for @xmath3 , the ring potential in the ir limit consists of a term proportional to @xmath4 , in addition to the expected @xmath5 term arising from the static limit . here",
    ", @xmath35 is the fine structure constant .",
    "this term can be viewed as a nonperturbative correction to qed effective potential in addition to the perturbative loop corrections to this potential in the corresponding @xmath36 order .",
    "note that , using hard thermal loop ( htl ) expansion @xcite , similar contributions of order @xmath37 and @xmath38 are previously found in qcd effective potential at finite temperature and zero magnetic field ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    in the strong magnetic field limit , the ring potential of qed at finite temperature includes a novel term consisting of a dilogarithmic function @xmath7 . as in the weak magnetic field limit , similar contribution to qcd effective potential at finite temperature and zero magnetic field",
    "is calculated in @xcite . here",
    ", going beyond the static limit , it is shown that qcd effective potential consists of an unexpected @xmath39 term .",
    "the appearance of a similar term in the qed ring potential at finite temperature and in the presence of strong magnetic field is however expected due to the well - known phenomenon of magnetic catalysis @xcite ; in the limit of strong magnetic field , qed dynamics is believed to be dominated by the lowest landau level ( lll ) , where the chiral symmetry of the theory is broken by a dynamically generated fermion mass . as a consequence of a dimensional reduction from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , four dimensional qed exhibits confining properties like ordinary confining abelian or non - abelian gauge theories without magnetic field @xcite .",
