    "small clusters of atoms of metallic elements have interesting physical properties@xcite which originate in the strong interference effects that appear when the coherence length @xmath1 of the electronic excitations is larger than the size @xmath2 of the particle . as already noted by kubo@xcite",
    ", this would allow the manifestation of the geometry dependent quantization of electron energies .",
    "this condition leads to the very active field of mesoscopic physics@xcite which involves a deep revision of traditional ways of calculation and interpretation of transport and spectroscopic@xcite properties . on the other hand the diverse technical applications of metal particles as well as composites of metal particles",
    "has pushed the development of a wealth of sample preparation techniques@xcite@xcite which allow varied system characteristic .",
    "it has been recognized@xcite@xcite@xcite that nmr can be a useful tool to characterize metallic nanoparticles and that further insight in the comprehension of their properties requires the development of models which allow a quantification of spectra .",
    "such a model should contain the basic physics involved : each magnetic nucleus is sensitive to _ local _ magnetic polarization of electrons which changes the effective field .",
    "this manifests@xcite as different ( knight ) shifts in the nmr absorption frequencies leading to inhomogeneous line broadening and different relaxation times . while it is obvious that a close connection exists between the output of an nmr experiment and the geometry and disorder of the particle on which the electronic properties depend , we are still far from a universal quantitative description of the effect .    in this paper",
    "we address the problem of how the size of a particle contributes to the nmr lineshape . because of quantum interferences , the details of shape and disorder of the nanoparticles manifest@xcite@xcite as a wigner - dyson or poisson distribution of electronic energy levels depending on whether the states are extended ( metallic phase ) or localized ( dielectric phase ) . in both cases , there are strong fluctuations in the local density of states ( ldos ) and hence in the local pauli susceptibility . since samples used in earlier experiments had a distribution of particle sizes , the inhomogeneous line shapes were assigned to this distribution .",
    "different sizes would not only give a different number of electrons at the fermi energy ( average density of states ) but also involve a fluctuation in the parity of total electron number giving a further contribution to the inhomogeneity .",
    "however , these efforts , based in a canonical ensemble , do not give a consistent explanation for the observed lineshape valid for all the systems studied .",
    "a recent _ break - through _ was proposed@xcite with the use of grand canonical ensemble which allows for fluctuations in the particle charge .",
    "this picture , which is valid in many experimental situations , emphasizes the fact that inhomogeneities manifest already in a single particle .",
    "therefore inhomogeneous broadening occurs even when particles are exactly equal .",
    "this is observed @xcite for the ligand - stabilized metal - cluster compounds pt@xmath3phen@xmath4o@xmath5 estimations of this shape were performed using an electronic structure represented by a non - linear sigma model@xcite and by a random matrix theory ( rmt)@xcite . both models produce the same results for the ldos fluctuations .",
    "one could visualize the model hamiltonian implicit in the rmt theory , considering a set on @xmath6  atomic orbitals  whose interactions , not constrained to a given lattice , are described by the hamiltonian matrix elements @xmath7 , which are random and satisfy a gaussian distribution @xmath8,$ ] with @xmath9 a normalization constant and @xmath10 to keep a finite band width @xmath11 . since the analytical solutions are obtained in the limit @xmath12 , each ",
    "orbital  sees an equivalent  mean field  environment .",
    "while solutions describe fluctuations in the ldos , they can not distinguish surface from bulk  orbitals  or the explicit geometry of the particles neither describe the transition to the localized regime . hence , while these analytical models contain the essential physics of level statistics , they are not expected to provide a detailed characterization of different materials and particle geometries . in order to overcome this limitation , in this work we use a very simple tight binding model for the electronic structure that is a first step toward a more precise description of the nanoparticles in terms of linear combination of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) .",
    "a similar model was used recently@xcite@xcite to describe the cross over between wigner - dyson and poisson statistics .",
    "we will also show that resorting to appropriate calculation tools ( e.g. matrix continued fractions ) such models can be used in practical calculations .",
    "the electronic system is described by the hamiltonian    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the energy of the @xmath0-like atomic state centered at nuclei position @xmath15 orthogonalized atomic orbital @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are real numbers accounting for the kinetic energy of the electrons .",

    "mean field description , charge transfer energies are accounted for conserving the structure of ( [ h ] ) .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field @xmath22 leads to the unitary symmetry and can be included in the hamiltonian through the peierls substitution .",
    "however , for experimentally accessible fields ( @xmath23 ) and typical particle sizes ( @xmath24 ) its effect is negligible ( @xmath25 @xmath26 with @xmath27 @xmath28 ) because degeneracies are already broken by the disorder and we restrict our calculation to orthogonal symmetry . in principle , interactions with other particles produce a decay of the eigenstates and enter through an inhomogeneous broadening of the ionization energy of orbitals at surfaces@xcite ( @xmath29 ) , accounting for electron tunneling toward neighbor particles . while this is not much complication in a numerical treatment of the problem , to allow for comparison with previous works , we adopt here a simpler description in which @xmath30 at every site .",

    "[ @xcite ] . for completeness",

    "as expected for a given @xmath101 their results tend to give a higher @xmath58 than our numerical values .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the breaking of time reversal symmetry produces a stronger level repulsion diminishing the fluctuations",
    ".    however , there is no universal scaling function that fits the complete lineshape for all systems .",
    "this is because in our model there are surfaces .",
    "although we did not assign different ionization energies to surface orbitals ( which can produce tamm states ) , local densities of states at surface region ( about @xmath102 of the total ) can differ substantially from that at inner atoms@xcite .",
    "sites at the surfaces are connected to fewer neighbors and this manifest on a decrease in the wings of the ldos as a consequence of lower gain in kinetic energy@xcite , which is compensated with an increase of the ldos at energies around @xmath20 .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that the sign of the change in the ldos  at surfaces depends both , on the lattice structure and on the value of @xmath103 ; e.g. if @xmath104 the surface ldos would be higher than its value in the bulk . in any case , this produces an additional fluctuation in the ldos which is more important for smaller systems .",
    "these effects attenuate within a few lattice constants and are consistent with the exponential healing length model @xcite . in fig .",
    "@xmath105 we separate the contributions to the distribution of ldos ( linewidth ) from surface and inner sites in a small cluster .",
    "similar separations of maxima are obtained at higher @xmath106 to emphasize the importance of this effect on the line broadening in small particles , we show in fig.(5 ) the scaling function satisfied by @xmath58 as function of the adimensional parameter @xmath101 for a @xmath107 cluster in which we also discriminate the contributions of surface and inner sites@xmath55 it is clear a general tendency toward lower values of the knight shift for nuclei at the surfaces .",
    "maxima do not coincide even when @xmath101 is increased . in small clusters",
    "this effect manifests as an intrinsic linewidth persisting at high temperatures , a tendency that departs from the scaling law .",
    "this is the situation observed in recent experiments@xcite@xcite on pt@xmath3 and ni@xmath108pt@xmath109 particles , where linewidths do not shrink with increasing temperature .",
    "our results suggest that size and temperature dependence of line shapes can be used in conjunction with other nmr techniques such as sedor@xcite to allow the experimental identification of electronic densities at surface regions .",
    ", in agreement with analytical theories@xcite@xcite for mesoscopic fluctuation , our results show that distribution of ldos ( and hence nmr line ) shifts and asymmetrically broadens as temperature decreases and particle size diminishes and can be described by a universal scaling law which is consistent general trends observed in cu particles and the size dependence @xcite@xcite of pt@xmath3 and ni@xmath108pt@xmath109 particles , although the origin of the disorder in the last cases is not quite clear . in this case",
    "a finite broadening is obtained even for high temperatures . these departures from scaling theory in very small particles , is understood in our model as due to the presence of surfaces , a feature that the analytical theories do not contain .",
    "therefore , our lcao model contains the main features of mesoscopic fluctuations and models the exponential healing of surface effects . due to the simplicity and speed of the mcf calculation",
    ", it allows for further improvements of the model hamiltonian which should lead to a more detailed evaluation of the electronic structure .",
    "also orbital susceptibility could be quantified within these models .",
    "since cu has also a contribution to the linewidth due to quadrupolar interactions , and pt , having a @xmath110-band contribution to the fermi surface , has an important core polarization susceptibility , they are far from ideal systems . a good candidate for a full quantification",
    "the described behavior is ag , with spin 1/2 nucleus and @xmath0 electrons .",
    "therefore , further development along these lines would allow for : 1 ) a better quantification of nmr experiments ; 2 ) the investigation of the electron states determining the chemical kinetics at surfaces and 3 ) the progress in the understanding of basic phenomena at a mesoscopic scale . while the first issue was the main one addressed in this article we would like to add a few comments on the other two .",
    "since in a frontier - orbital picture of bonding to metal surfaces , the states around the fermi energy are those that determine the chemical reactions , it is of great interest to determine how these are modified by changing the size and disorder of the catalyst particle@xcite . in particular a metal - insulator transition in the low dimensional ( tamm ) surface band could play a very relevant role in chemical kinetics .",
    "therefore , the theoretical and experimental methods described in this paper can be conveniently adapted to suit this investigation . *",
    "* finally , the interference phenomena lying in the core of mesoscopic physics could be controlled to obtain a fine tuning of many static and dynamical properties of materials .",
    "in particular , the present technique could be used to complement current studies@xcite that attempt to quantify the interplay of disorder , magnetic field and temperature in the metal - insulator transition .",
