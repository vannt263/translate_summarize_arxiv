    "the cosmological principle states that the universe is homogeneous in the large - scale average .",
    "however , after the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) first - year release , the quadrupole ( with multipole moment @xmath0 ) and octopole ( @xmath1 ) patterns of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) map were reported to be aligned along a particular axis @xcite . later , with more significant statistics the quadrupole plane and the three octopole planes are far more aligned , three of these planes are orthogonal to the ecliptic , the normals to these planes are aligned with the direction of the dipole and with the equinoxes , and the remaining octopole plane is orthogonal to the supergalactic plane @xcite ; the next two harmonics also appear to be aligned with the quadrupole and octopole @xcite .",
    "such odd large - scale anomalies in cmb anisotropy , indicating the universe being arrayed around special axes , were also found by more works on the following released three- , five- and seven - year wmap data .    for cmb experiments and for studies of the very early universe , it is greatly important to find out whether the curious behavior in the low @xmath2 cmb modes being just a coincidence produced by primordial fluctuations in our particular hubble volume ( by cosmic variance ) , or caused by a measurement error @xcite .",
    "here we point out that these `` axes of evil '' do exist due to the nature of cmb observations : the doppler dipole is around the direction of the solar system s motion to the cmb ; the inhomogeneous integration - time maps of both wmap and planck observations have characteristic patterns with the ecliptic plane being most sparsely observed and two poles over - sampled ; furthermore , the dipole axis depends on the motions of the antenna to the solar system , the solar system to the galaxy , and the galaxy to the local supergalaxy , etc . comparing with the cmb anisotropy , the doppler dipole signal is very strong , thus its predicted amplitude has to be calculated and removed from the raw data of any observation during the scanning process , observation by observation .",
    "an error in the predicted dipole signal will cause a deviation in the dipole - cleaned temperature , which will be accumulated into artificial anisotropies in the final map after completing a full - sky survey .",
    "these artificial anisotropies might carry traces of the dipole and scanning scheme ; therefore , the combining effect of the dipole and scanning scheme has to be carefully inspected and removed in cmb experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "the scan - induced anisotropy in cmb maps might also be useful in monitoring motions of our local universe .    in this paper",
    ", we show in  2 that measurement and calculation errors relevant to the doppler dipole can induce considerable deviations in observed cmb temperatures .",
    "we further demonstrate in  3 that such dipole relevant deviations combining with observational scan pattern will produce artificial anisotropies in resultant cmb maps , particularly at the largest angular scales , and show how can such scan - induced pattern on large scales be predicted by the true dipole moment and observational scan scheme . in ",
    "4 we show that the expected scan - induced quadrupole pattern of the wmap mission is perfectly in agreement with the published wmap quadrupole . with the scan strategy of the planck mission , we find that there will also exist an artificial aligned quadrupole . finally , in  5 we demonstrate that it s possible to remove the observational scan induced effect , and only after doing so can the cmb anisotropy be reliably detected .",
    "for a sky pixel @xmath3 with the unit direction vector @xmath4 , the doppler signal @xmath5 where @xmath6k is the monopole temperature , @xmath7 the joint velocity of antenna relative to the cmb , @xmath8 the speed of light .",
    "the doppler signal on all sky pixels gives a dipole moment with a pattern of half - hot , half - cold structure along a special axis , which strongly dominates observed full - sky microwave maps with amplitude greater than 3mk , two orders of magnitude stronger than the cmb anisotropy .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the sky pixel pointed by the antenna at time @xmath10 , the dipole component in the measured temperature can be calculated by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spacecraft velocity relative to the cmb rest frame , and @xmath13 is the unit direction , or line - of - sight ( los ) , of the antenna at time @xmath10 in the cmb rest frame .",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are corresponding vectors in the spacecraft coordinate system . to remove the dipole signal in cmb map",
    ", @xmath16 has to be evaluated for each observation by eq.[equ : dipole ] and then be subtracted from the observed time - ordered data .",
    "an los error will produce a pseudo signal in the calculated @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the los error vectors in a sky coordinate system and in the spacecraft frame , respectively . in the spacecraft frame the los error",
    "@xmath19 is a constant vector . after subtracting the calculated dipole signal @xmath20 ,",
    "a temperature deviation @xmath21 will be left in the resulting cmb temperature on the sky pixel @xmath9 .",
    "even if the real los is exactly determined , other observational errors can also produce pseudo dipole signal just like an los error .",
    "for example , we found a 25.6ms timing offset between the spacecraft attitude and radiometer output timestamps in the raw wmap time - ordered data , which can generate a pseudo signal in calculating the doppler dipole as if there were @xmath22 los error ( liu , xiong & li 2010 ) .",
    "the error in the direction of cmb dipole , or in the vector @xmath23 in eq.[equ : dipole ] , can also produce a pseudo dipole signal like a los error .",
    "the cmb dipole determined by the cobe or wmap mission has a direction error great than @xmath24 @xcite , which can not be ignored in producing pseudo dipole signals .",
    "a microwave antenna has response to a large solid angle , not merely in the main beam along the los .",
    "the complete sidelobe response can be described by a full sky map of normalized gain @xmath25 in the spacecraft coordinate system , in which the antenna is static and @xmath26 does not change with time , with the summation of all gains ( including the main beam ) being equal to @xmath27 ( the number of pixels in the map ) .",
    "the sidelobe pickup comes mainly from the dipole moment , which is the dominating signal source in the foreground - cleaned sky . for an observation to the sky pixel @xmath9 at time @xmath10 ,",
    "the recorded signal is contaminated by the dipole induced sidelobe pickup @xmath28 where the summation goes over all sidelobe pixels @xmath29 in the spacecraft frame , and @xmath30 is the dipole amplitude of the sky pixel @xmath31 .",
    "the sidelobe pickup @xmath32 calculated by eq.[equ : pickup ] also has to be subtracted from the observed temperature .",
    "an error @xmath33 in sidelobe response will produce a pseudo signal in the sidelobe pickup calculated by eq.[equ : pickup ] @xmath34 where it s self - evident that @xmath35 , the result of the summation , is a constant vector .",
    "thus it can be seen as an equivalent los error .",
    "after subtracting the calculated sidelobe pickup , a temperature deviation @xmath36 will be left in the resulting cmb temperature at the sky pixel @xmath9 .      in stead of eq .",
    "[ equ : pseudo ] and eq .",
    "[ equ : pickup_error ] , we can take @xmath37 as an overall los error and use @xmath38 to estimate the overall deviation in the observed temperature at pixel @xmath9 after subtracting the dipole signal and sidelobe pickup contamination .",
    "in eq.[equ : error ] , the velocity @xmath12 is determined mainly by the solar system s movement with respect to the cmb , and is hence approximately a constant vector in the galactic coordinate system .",
    "the overall los error @xmath39 is a constant vector in the spacecraft frame . during a scan period that vectors @xmath40 are pointing within the hot - half / cold - half area of the dipole moment pattern in the galactic coordinate system ( in other words ,",
    "the dot - product @xmath41 are positive / negative in the spacecraft frame ) , temperature deviations @xmath42 will be negative / positive and temperatures @xmath43 lower / higher , and the corresponding sky pixels @xmath9 will draw a continual cold / hot trace along the scan trajectory in the sky . finally , when a full - sky survey is completed , all deviations @xmath42 will be combined into a map .",
    "the final deviation @xmath44 at a certain pixel @xmath3 can be calculated by @xmath45 with @xmath46 being the number of observations to the pixel @xmath3 .",
    "the final deviation map is structured with a pattern that resembles the exposure map ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : planck deviation ] ,  [ fig : wmap deviation ] ) .",
    "our idl source code for calculating @xmath44 has been made publicly available .    for a continuous - sweep mission ,",
    "the design of scanning strategy is constrained by a number of technical factors , e.g. solar irradiation , on - board fuel consumption , contact with ground antennas etc .",
    ", it is very difficult to achieve a homogeneous survey . with inhomogeneous coverage , continuous - scan induced anisotropies should consequentially be inhomogeneous with artificial spherical harmonics of low - order moments .",
    "in fact , the wmap team already realized that the large - scale non - gaussian anisotropy features are very similar to the wmap scan pattern @xcite , just as expected by the scan - induced anisotropy analyzed above , and we found that the pixel temperature is significantly correlated with the number of observations @xcite .",

    "the artificial quadrupole from any overall los error @xmath61 can be calculated by @xmath62 .",
    "fig.[fig : expectation ] shows four possible planck quadrupole patterns with @xmath63 , ( 1,1,-1 ) , ( 1,-1,1 ) , and ( 1,-1,-1 ) , respectively .",
    "it is expected from fig.[fig : expectation ] that , due to scan - induced anisotropies , there may also exist an artificial quadrupole in planck .",
    "it may also be aligned with an axis lying in the ecliptic , ( like the case shown in the left panel of fig.[fig : expectation ] ) , or in the galaxy s plane ( the right panel of fig.[fig : expectation ] ) , or more possibly between the ecliptic and galaxy s plane .",
    "note that the exact templates of scan - induced anisotropies can be calculated when the real planck data release is available .",
    "thus the amplitudes shown here are only qualitative .",
    "the real planck quadrupole depends on the real overall los error vector .",
    "our calculations are based on the simulated planck scanning scheme with assumed initial conditions of scan geometry .",
    "the real pattern of the scan - induced planck quadrupole could hence be some kind of rotation or sign reversion to the ones shown here .",
    "we use the wmap q1-band one - year scan scheme without any mask ( because we do nt use the temperature data ) to produce an expected scan - induced deviation map with the resolution parameter @xmath64 , the resultant exposure map is shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : nobs ] .",
    "similar to the planck mission , we calculate temperature deviation maps @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 shown in the upper panels of fig.[fig : wmap deviation ] , where the bottom panels show their quadrupole components and fig.[fig : wmap deviation ] are by the real scan scheme . ] .",
    "different to the planck mission , the deviation components in y- and z - axis for the wmap mission have much smaller amplitudes and the three quadrupole components are very similar to each other , thus we can predict the scan - induced quadrupole pattern more determinately .",

    "we find that an overall los error with amplitude of about @xmath68 can produce most observed wmap quadrupole ( liu , xiong & li 2010 ) . in previous works by roukema ( 2010 ) and",
    "liu , xiong & li ( 2011 ) , two different methods have been independently used to detect possible timing offset effects in the temperature map and raw data respectively , and fully consistent results that support the existence of such effects have been obtained . on the other hand , a sidelobe uncertainty of about @xmath69 can also produce a similar artificial quadrupole alone .",
    "they can take effect simultaneously , and it s hard to exactly distinguish them , thus the best way to remove them together is probably by using a template - based approach ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "as for the sidelobe uncertainty issue , a possible way is to improve the sidelobe measurement accuracy to see if the corresponding temperature deviation can be reduced .",
    "however , we have found that , although the wmap team have provided sidelobe response data files in each official release , there is no essential improvement except for some minor posterior processing adjustment from wmap1 to wmap7 .",
    "we have even seen that the k1-band sidelobe response files are exactly the same for all releases .",
    "since the wmap spacecraft has now stopped working , we probably need to wait for planck for an improved and independent sidelobe measurement , so as to run a possible test on the sidelobe uncertainty issues .",
    "it has been found that the wmap cmb temperatures are significantly correlated with the corresponding number of observations @xcite .",
    "the scan induced artificial anisotropy is probably the most likely explanation to this phenomenon . with",
    "the same program used to detect the observation number correlation , we have checked the average absolute correlation strength between the simulated scan induced artificial anisotropy and the corresponding exposure map , which are 0.58 and 0.53 for wmap and planck respectively , strong enough to be able to leave some detectable scan - pattern like trace amongst real cmb , noise and foreground .",
    "therefore , it is possible to check the scan induced artificial anisotropy by the correlation method in both missions .",
    "if the planck image quality is really very good , then it will be even possible to see the characteristic pattern of scan induced artificial anisotropy directly in its result .",
    "the equivalent los error described in  [ sec : sidelobe ] is a common problem in cmb experiments , because the doppler dipole moment dominates all observed full - sky cmb maps . the only way to eliminate the equivalent los error a priori is to know the antenna 4@xmath70 response exactly , but",
    "this is very difficult : if the uncertainty of sidelobe response is about @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath72 , then with the data file of wmap sidelobe response , the amplitude @xmath73 of the equivalent los error induced by sidelobe doppler pickup ( ignore the main lobe uncertainty ) can be estimated by @xmath74 which are @xmath75 for different bands . from fig.[fig : wmap deviation ] we see that @xmath51 equivalent los error ( requiring sidelobe error @xmath76 ) is enough to produce @xmath77k temperature deviation .",
    "however , this is for the sidelobe only .",
    "the main lobe response is much stronger than sidelobe : if we take the main lobe efficiency as @xmath78 , then the overall main lobe response is about 50 times stronger than the overall sidelobe , and hence @xmath79 main lobe response error can probably produce temperature deviation with similar amplitude to @xmath80 sidelobe uncertainty . if we believe that the temperature deviation should be less than 1 @xmath81 for a highly reliable cmb estimation , then these two percentage data ( @xmath80 for sidelobe and @xmath82 for main lobe ) roughly describe the required antenna response accuracy .    for the sidelobe gain map of the first year wmap observation ,",
    "the overall calibration uncertainty is estimated as large as @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "is actually an average level uncertainty , which means the total sidelobe efficiency is @xmath84 uncertain .",
    "apparently , this is only part of the overall uncertainty which is relevant to not only the total efficiency , but also response on each pixel @xmath29 . ]",
    "although we believe that the planck mission has a much better performance , a requirement like @xmath76 sidelobe uncertainty or @xmath79 main lobe gain uncertainty might still exceed the equipment limitation .",
    "besides the sidelobe contamination , @xmath24 error in the doppler dipole direction @xcite also can not be ignored .",
    "therefore , to get a reliable cmb map , the overall los error has to be considered and the scan - induced artificial anisotropy has to be removed posterior . without doing so , cmb maps from sweep missions , including cobe , wmap , and planck as well , all can only be preliminary and yield unreliable results .      to remove the scan - induced anisotropy ,",
    "the main difficulty is that the overall los error is unknown . in other words ,",
    "the error vector @xmath85 has three unknown coefficients @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .",
    "is it possible to remove unfavorable signals with unknown intensities ?",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "several techniques can do it . for example , observed sky microwave maps are contaminated by diffusion foreground emission generated by different diffusion processes with known physical mechanisms but unknown intensities .",
    "the wmap team used template fits with the unknown intensities as fitted parameters to remove these foreground emission effectively , and also used the ilc method  using the internal linear combination of observed maps at different frequencies with estimated weights to suppress foreground and noise as far as possible @xcite .",
    "similar methods can also be used to diagnose the pseudo dipole and minimize the scan - induced anisotropy @xcite .    for a cmb mission",
    ", we produce template maps @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 of scan - induced anisotropy from its scan scheme with an assumed value of @xmath89 and letting @xmath90 . from the observed cmb map @xmath91 and with the templates maps",
    ", we can derive the cleaned map @xmath92 where the coefficients @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are determined by minimizing the variance of @xmath96 .",
    "the result of template - based removal is not dependent on the amplitude @xmath89 that is assumed for the overall los error .",
    "a larger amplitude leads to a lower fitted coefficient in template fitting so that the final correction to the cmb map is the same . to show the ability of scan - induced anisotropy removal by template fits",
    ", we simulate an observed cmb temperature map with the `` synfast '' routine in the healpix software package ( available at http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov ) and a @xmath97cdm model power spectrum with a quadrupole of 1351@xmath98k@xmath99 shown in the left panels of fig.[fig : removing ] .",
    "to the temperature map we add deviations from the wmap scanning scheme with an artificial quadrupole of 6492@xmath98k@xmath99 to produce a simulated observed map , shown in the upper middle panel of fig.[fig : removing ] .",
    "the lower middle panel shows the quadrupole component of the simulated observed map with a measured quadrupole of 5768@xmath98k@xmath99 .",
    "after template removal , we get a cleaned map ( the upper right panel of fig.[fig : removing ] ) and its quadrupole component with an amplitude of 1186@xmath98k@xmath99 ( the lower right panel of fig.[fig : removing ] )",
    ". we can see from fig.[fig : removing ] that the template removal approach can effectively remove the scan - induced artificial effect from an observed map , and in both amplitude and structure pattern , the quadrupole component in the cleaned map is more reliable than that without the template removing , even the artificial quadrupole ( 6492@xmath98k@xmath99 ) is much stronger than the real signal ( 1351@xmath98k@xmath99 ) .",

    "should the artificial anisotropy be removed with the templates before releasing a final cmb map ?",
    "the answer obviously should be yes .",
    "unfortunately , in the meantime , many would prefer to accept the odd `` axis of evil '' rather than a cleaned result after necessary correction .",
    "they worry about the corrected quadrupole being too low because the released wmap quadrupole is already lower than expected from the standard cosmology model . in exploring nature , however , to make experimental data reliable should be more important than to make it satisfy a theoretical requirement .",
    "furthermore , in fact current inflation theories can not predict the cmb fluctuation amplitude at the largest angular scale if the time when the scale left the horizon was as early as before the reheating period while the primordial density perturbations had not occurred .",
