    "the calculation of the deep - inelastic structure functions of hadrons from _ qcd _ is basically a non - perturbative problem .",
    "perturbation theory can only describe the evolution of the structure functions from one scale to the other , provided one is at high enough scales . the most promising tool to solve this problem is lattice gauge theory .",
    "three years ago we have initiated a program to compute the lower moments of the structure functions of the nucleon on the lattice .",
    "first results for the unpolarized structure functions @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the polarized structure functions @xmath2",

    "it has been found that with the help of dedicated computers one is able to compute the lower moments of all four structure functions with satisfactory precision  at least for the non - singlet leading twist contributions which we have addressed so far .",
    "it is needless to say that all these calculations have been performed in the quenched approximation , where the effect of internal quark loops has been neglected .",
    "three or four moments are generally sufficient to determine the individual quark distribution functions  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have extended our calculations to the structure functions of the pion and the rho  @xcite .",
    "the pion structure function is being measured at _ hera _ , and data should soon become available .",
    "the structure functions of the rho are interesting because they give qualitatively new information about quark binding effects .",
    "lattice calculations are subject to systematic errors arising from the finite lattice spacing , the finite volume , the extrapolation to the chiral limit and , of course , quenching .",
    "before we can trust our results entirely , it is important to examine these effects carefully .",
    "this will be a major task in the future .",
    "the aim of this talk is twofold . in the first part we will present and discuss our results obtained over the last two years",
    "this will be mainly about the nucleon structure functions and briefly about the structure functions of the pion and the rho .",
    "in the second part of the talk we will report on first attempts to reduce discretization errors .",

    "the calculations on the large volume were nearly as expensive in computer time as the high statistics calculations on the smaller volume as we went to smaller quark masses .",
    "for the calculation of the gluon distribution function we even used @xmath42 configurations . by comparing the results on the two volumes , we find that our calculations on the @xmath35 lattice do not suffer from finite size effects .",

    "let us now discuss the results in some detail .",
    "we begin with the unpolarized structure functions in table 1 .",
    "we see that the lattice prediction for the lowest moment , @xmath39 , is significantly larger than the lowest moment of the phenomenological valence quark distribution function , both for the @xmath44 and the @xmath45 quark .",
    "when one goes to the higher moments the agreement improves .    what does this mean for the structure functions themselves ? in @xcite",
    "the moments from table 1 have been converted to ` real ' structure functions . in fig .",
    "1 the result is shown for the @xmath44-quark distribution function .",
    "this is compared with the phenomenological curve .",
    "we see that the ` lattice ' structure function is quite different in shape from the experimental one .",
    "the difference shows mainly at @xmath46 values around @xmath47 .",
    "we do not expect that the missing internal quark loops will have an effect at such large values of @xmath46 .",
    "if the effect is real , it could mean that the experimental structure functions contain substantial higher - twist contributions .",
    "one would expect higher - twist contributions to show up predominantly at large @xmath46 .",
    "the lowest moment of the gluon distribution function , @xmath48 , turns out to be consistent with experiment .",
    "the relatively large error has to do with the fact that the calculation requires a delicate subtraction between two terms similar in magnitude  @xcite .",
    "quark and gluon contributions to @xmath39 must add up to one , as a result of energy - momentum conservation .",
    "we obtain @xmath49    let us now turn to the polarized structure functions in table 2 . here",
    "we have a lot of experimental data to compare with , so that we do not have to rely only on the phenomenological distribution functions .",
    "a recent , and yet unpublished , piece of information comes from the _ smc _ measurement of the charge asymmetry of fast pions in polarized muon - nucleon collisions  @xcite . in the asymmetry",
    "the effect of sea quarks drops out , and one is lead directly to the moments of the valence quark distribution functions @xmath50 the lattice calculation of @xmath51 and @xmath52 is reported here for the first time  .",
    "for the higher moments sea quark effects should not play any significant role any more because they are restricted to the region of small @xmath46 .    with two exceptions ,",
    "the moments of the polarized structure functions agree surprisingly well with experiment .",
    "one exception is the axial vector coupling constant @xmath53 .",
    "experimentally , this is one of the best known quantities , and the sea quark contribution is expected to cancel out .",
    "the lattice result turns out to be quite a bit lower than the experimental value .",
    "the other exception is the twist - three matrix element @xmath54 , contributing to the second moment of the structure function @xmath3 .",
    "comparing existing data on @xmath2 and @xmath3 , one is lead to the result @xmath55 , both for the @xmath44 and the @xmath45 quark .",
    "we find that @xmath56 in the chiral limit . in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath54 vanishes as one would expect .",
    "we have no explanation for this discrepancy",
    ". we do not think that it can be explained by finite cut - off effects and the effect of quenching .",
    "the pion and rho structure functions have been computed from @xmath57 gauge field configurations on the @xmath35 lattice . as before , the coupling was taken to be @xmath58 .    for the pion we obtain in the chiral limit @xmath59 if we compare this result with indirect information from the drell - yan cross section  @xcite , we find the same picture as for the nucleon : @xmath39 comes out to be significantly larger than the phenomenological value , while @xmath60 and @xmath61 are consistent with the data .",
    "the unpolarized rho structure function looks very similar to the pion structure function . for the moment @xmath43 ( the counterpart of @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ in5 ] ) with @xmath63 instead of @xmath47 ) of the polarized structure function we find @xmath64 indicating that the valence quarks carry 60% of the spin of the rho .",
    "this is about the same fraction as one finds for the nucleon .",
    "the lowest moment of the polarized structure function @xmath65 turns out to be positive and unexpectedly large , albeit with large statistical errors .",
    "a possible interpretation of this is that the valence quarks have a significant orbital angular momentum .",
    "wilson fermions ( which we are using here ) give rise to systematic errors of @xmath66 , while the standard gluonic action induces errors of @xmath67 only .",
    "therefore it is the fermionic action which is most in need of attention . from hadron mass calculations we know that discretization errors can have a significant effect on the results at present values of the coupling  @xcite .",
    "since it is very expensive to reduce cut - off effects by reducing @xmath26 , a better way of reducing them is by improving the action .",
    "a systematic improvement program reducing the cut - off errors order by order in @xmath26 has been proposed by symanzik  @xcite and was further developed in  . by adding the ( irrelevant ) term @xmath68 to the ( wilson ) action  @xcite and choosing the coefficient @xmath69 appropriately  @xcite , one can reduce the cut - off errors from @xmath66 to @xmath67 , provided the operators",
    "are improved as well .    in figs . 2 and 3",
    "we show first results of the @xmath66 improved theory for the moments the improved operators and the renormalization constants were taken from  @xcite , while for @xmath39 we used improved operators and renormalization constants suggested by tadpole improved perturbation theory  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath39 and @xmath43 .",
    "the calculations are done on the @xmath35 lattice at @xmath58 .",
    "we compare the improved results with the unimproved numbers . to facilitate the comparison , we have only looked at one operator on one lattice . in the case of @xmath43",
    "we see no difference between the two results at any value of the ( bare ) quark mass . in the case of the moment @xmath39 we see only a small effect , which is however not statistically significant . for both moments",
    "the quark mass dependence is rather weak and unspectacular , so that a linear extrapolation to the chiral limit is justified .",
    "we may conclude that our numbers for @xmath39 and @xmath43 are not far from the continuum values ( of the quenched theory ) .",
    "this means that we have a real problem with the unpolarized structure functions .",
    "it is very likely that the solution lies in unexpectedly large higher - twist contributions at our values of @xmath4 .",
    "the situation of the axial vector coupling constant @xmath70 has also not changed .",
    "one should , however , keep in mind that the naive parton model identification of @xmath70 with @xmath71 might fail .",
    "whether discretization errors are also small for the other moments remains to be seen .",
    "we have reviewed the current status of lattice structure function calculations .",
    "the results so far are encouraging .",
    "but it is clear that much more remains to be done .",
    "we have only begun to improve the calculation by systematically removing discretization errors , and this will certainly occupy us throughout the next year .    a topic which is of upcoming interest  @xcite is power corrections ( see also above ) .",
    "this includes higher twist effects on the one hand and renormalon contributions on the other .",
