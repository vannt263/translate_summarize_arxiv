    "the stellar bulges of disk galaxies are thought to be a complex mix of heterogeneous stellar populations , spanning a large range of age and chemical composition .",
    "yet they show surprising similarities to elliptical galaxies .    in the modern cosmological framework ,",
    "massive elliptical galaxies are thought to have formed through numerous mergers and interactions between smaller galaxies @xcite .",
    "significant mergers are suspected to have happened more frequently in the earlier universe ( say , @xmath7 ) and thus their stellar properties are rather uniformly old and metal - rich .",
    "their dramatic evolution progressively changed their kinematic properties toward more chaotic orbits .",
    "these probably are the background for the tight scaling relations found for the stellar properties of elliptical galaxies , such as faber - jackson relation @xcite , color - magnitude relation @xcite , black hole - bulge mass relation @xcite , and the fundamental plane @xcite .",
    "while the details are still debated , the community generally agrees on the early formation of massive elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "would the similarities between bulges and elliptical galaxies then suggest similar formation history ? this has been the main question in numerous previous investigations @xcite .",
    "some studies indeed found evidence that bulges and ellipticals share very similar stellar properties based on stellar population analyses @xcite .",
    "however , bulges may have wider varieties in their properties .",
    "for example , the presence of  fake \" bulges , also known as pseudobulges @xcite , and boxy / peanut bulges seems clear @xcite .",
    "the relative size of bulge compared to the disk is known to correlate with galaxy morphology @xcite .",
    "however it is not trivial to explain why this is so .",
    "the similarity of the stellar bulge of a large sa and a large elliptical galaxies may be easier to accept , but it is less clear why the small bulge of an sd galaxy should share the same trends of stellar and kinematic properties as large ellipticals .    in this study , we investigate the properties of a large sample of bulges from the sdss dr12 main galaxy sample , in the hope of answering some of these questions .",
    "we decompose the galaxies into bulge and disk components using the public tool @xcite .",
    "comprehensive studies , with similar goals , using similar tools , conducted on similar samples , have been performed previously @xcite . however , in some sense decomposition is often more art than science , and it is not all that clear how different studies derived their measurements .",
    "we perform our own decompositions and , unlike in many previous studies , we present the details of the input parameters and conditions in the decomposition routine so that future comparisons can be made .",
    "we describe a recipe for choosing the initial guess values of parameters , based on galaxy colour , and demonstrate its effectiveness .",
    "our bulge - to - total ratios correlate reasonably well with concentration index and hubble type , but they correlate with srsic index more weakly , likely due to large uncertainties on srsic index measurements . we inspect the properties of bulges of galaxies as a function of bulge - to - total ratio .",
    "this effectively links spirals , lenticulars , and ellipticals into a long sequence of increasing @xmath8 .",
    "we find that some bulges have very similar properties to ellipticals , while others differ in the slope , intercept , and scatter of scaling relations .",
    "we attempt to interpret these differences as a result of minor differences in the properties of stellar population , and to infer implications for the bulge formation .",
    "we adopt the @xmath9cdm cosmology of ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) = ( 70@xmath13 , 0.3 , 0.7 ) .",
    "our sample of galaxies is drawn from the sloan digital sky survey data release 12 @xcite .",
    "we obtain basic observational parameters such as magnitude , angular size , b / a ratio of galaxies from casjobs provided in dr12 .",
    "we also employ the ossy catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ossy ) for spectroscopic information .",
    "this provides improved spectral measurements on the sdss dr7 galaxies by utilizing gandalf ( gas and absorption line fitting ) and ppxf ( penalized pixel - fitting ) codes @xcite .",
    "we conduct all bulge and disk decompositions in the filters @xmath1 and @xmath2 . to achieve a more reliable decomposition",
    ", we perform our task only on close , apparently - large , and relatively face - on galaxies . after these selections 14,233 galaxies remained .",
    "we applied a volume limitation condition of @xmath14 , which corresponds to the sdss limiting apparent magnitude of @xmath15 at @xmath16 , to this database .",
    "the ossy catalog provides spectroscopic measurements on 10,240 of these .",
    "the details of our initial selection criteria are given in table 1 .",
    ".summary of initial sample selection [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab5 ]",
    "to investigate the properties of stellar bulges ranging from the large classical bulges of early - type galaxies to the much smaller bulges of late - type galaxies , we have performed a two - dimensional bulge - disk decomposition for 14,233 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 from the sdss dr12 using the program .",
    "the main results and their implications on the bulge formation can be summarized as follows .",
    "it is difficult to derive the size of bulge especially on small - bulge galaxies .",
    "this sounds obvious ; but in truth it is more a result of the shortcomings of the decomposition technique which affects the colors of the low - galaxies dramatically . as a result , ratios smaller than roughly 0.1 are very uncertain when sdss data are used .",
    "it is important for decomposition studies to explicitly give the details of their decomposition method , as the details have large impacts on the derivation of critical parameters , such as @xmath8 .    for the galaxies of @xmath17 ,",
    "bulge color is almost constant ( @xmath18 ) regardless of bulge size .",
    "the bulges in the low galaxies show a large spread in @xmath3 , and the blue bulges strongly hint at the presence of younger stellar populations .",
    "the results obtained from the three scaling relations ( kormendy relation , faber - jackson relation , and the fundamental plane ) suggest that bulges have a different mixture of their constituent stellar populations .",
    "the bulges in the lower @xmath8 galaxies have fainter surface brightness on average at fixed effective radius in the kormendy relation , and this variation seems to be gradual as a function of bulge size .    the bulges in lower galaxies show a lower velocity dispersion for a given bulge luminosity .",
    "this hints at the possibility that they are more dominated by ( rotational ) ordered motion .",
    "however , the photometric data we use here are not sufficient to make conclusive comments on kinematic properties of bulges .",
    "the stellar _ light _ properties are easier to access through the sdss data , and thus we investigate on the absorption and emission line properties of effectively `` bulges '' .",
    "some bulges in low galaxies appear to be substantially younger than those in large galaxies , roughly by an order of magnitude in ssp age .",
    "this is somewhat surprising because we earlier noted that the `` average '' optical @xmath3 color of bulges is roughly fixed against a variation in bulge size .",
    "a large fraction of the spread in slope and of the scatter in scaling relations seems to originate from the variation in stellar age , in other words , mass - to - light ratio .",
    "a varied mixture of minor and major mergers and a different degree of environmental effect would result in a wide range of which would then naturally explain the smooth distribution of bulges of differing size in the scaling relations .    if the results of our decomposition are robust , most bulges are similar to elliptical galaxies .",
    "but it is also clear that the bulges in low galaxies are increasingly deviating from the bulges in early - type galaxies with decreasing @xmath8 ratio .",
    "a gradual age difference can explain some of the observed properties but probably does not tell the whole story . if we may combine what is visible in our study with what has been suggested in other studies , it seems natural to conclude that the properties of bulges are a delicate result of the past history of mass build - up including star formation , mergers , and even secular and environmental effects .",
    "this may sound obvious because it probably applies to all galaxies .",
    "yet , the variation in the properties of bulges are much wider than that of elliptical galaxies and , accordingly , so maybe their formation processes .",
