    "the fast winds from massive stars and their subsequent supernovae ( sne ) ejecta dominate the mass and energy input to the interstellar medium ( ism ; e.g. , abbott 1982 ) and so may regulate star formation and galaxy evolution .",
    "most massive stars form in ob associations , and the concentrated energy input from massive stars in ob associations sweeps up the ambient ism to form expanding shells called superbubbles ( e.g. , mccray & snow 1979 ) .",
    "the physical structure of a superbubble is very similar to that of a bubble blown by the stellar wind of an isolated massive star @xcite .",
    "however , theories of such bubbles are still very uncertain and have not had much serious appraisal with observations of high quality .",
    "studies of galactic superbubbles are difficult because of their large angular sizes and the confusion of objects in the line of sight .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , in contrast , provides an excellent laboratory to study superbubbles since it is nearby ( at a distance of @xmath20  kpc , as adopted here , @xmath21 pc ; eastman & kirshner 1989 ) and almost face - on ( inclined by @xmath22 to the line of sight ; van der marel & cioni 2001 ) .",
    "it also has little foreground ( @xmath23 ; xu et al . 1992 ) or internal extinction ( @xmath24 in the range from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ; bessel 1991 ) .",
    "the superbubble 30 dor c (= dem l 263 ; davies , elliott , & meaburn 1976 ) is southwest of the main 30 doradus complex in the lmc , and is coincident with the large ob association lh 90 (= ngc 2044 ; lucke & hodge 1970 ) .",

    ", there is evidence for spectral variations in the x - ray emission across the face of the bubble . while the western part of the bubble is easily seen in the medium and hard band images , it is almost invisible in the soft band image , clearly due to the x - ray absorption by foreground cool gas ( see also dennerl et al .",

    "intriguingly , in the hard band image , the western part of the bubble appears much brighter than the eastern part , and is presumably more luminous .",

    "the main disadvantage of this approach is that the data are not directly compared to the model and so any test of the model will depend on the measurements used to derive the expected x - ray luminosity of the bubble ( e.g. , the number density and expansion velocity of the h ii region ) .",
    "also , the wide range of gas temperatures inside the bubble gives rise to soft x - ray emission in excess of that expected from a single temperature plasma model and emission lines from a wider range of ionization states than those expected from a single temperature thermal plasma model , which will naturally result in an underestimate of the heavy element abundances .",
    "the shortfall in the soft x - ray emission below @xmath86  kev from the single temperature thermal plasma model can also lead to an underestimate of the absorption column density , and hence the soft x - ray luminosity . in a more sophisticated analysis of 30 dor c with the _ einstein _ data ,",
    "@xcite compared the ipc spectrum with that expected from integrating the model over the bubble interior and folding the result through the ipc response . however , with the limited quality of the ipc data , they were unable to constrain tightly the basic spectral parameters such as temperature and absorption column density , let alone to test other interesting parameters such as the efficiency of thermal conduction and metal abundance of the x - ray emitting gas . in a more recent analysis of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data , @xcite discovered nonthermal x - ray emission from 30 dor c , although the discovery was made using a single temperature , non - equilibrium , ionized plasma model to describe the thermal emission from the bubble .",

    "the mos1 and mos2 spectra of the diffuse emission in the eastern and western parts of 30 dor c ( a total of 8 spectra ) were simultaneously fitted to the above wind - blown bubble model and a foreground absorption of a column density of @xmath101 .",
    "the absorption cross - sections and atomic abundances were taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "while the foreground absorption was allowed to be different between the eastern and western parts of 30 dor c , we constrained the bubble model to have the same temperature , metal abundance , and intensity in the eastern and western parts of 30 dor c. this model , which has 5 free parameters , gives a poor , simultaneous fit to the mos1 and mos2 data with @xmath102 ( 349 dof ) .",
    "we also did not obtain a significant improvement in the fit when we allowed the normalization of the bubble model to be different between the mos1 and mos2 datasets .",
    "an inspection of the spectra indicates that much of the deviation from the best - fit bubble model is due to an excess of hard x - rays in the spectra of the diffuse emission , particularly in the western part of 30 dor c. such an hard x - ray excess can naturally be explained as nonthermal x - ray emission , which can typically be described by a power - law .",
    "we therefore added a power - law component of photon index @xmath103 to our model fits .",
    "the normalization of the power - law continuum was allowed to vary between the eastern and western parts of 30 dor c , to account for the spatial variation in the hard x - ray emission ( fig  [ fig3 ] ) . in our initial modeling of the data ,",
    "the metal abundance was poorly constrained , with a lower limit of @xmath104 solar and an upper limit of several times solar .",
    "we therefore fixed the metal abundance at the known mean value of @xmath105 solar for the ism in the lmc @xcite .",
    "in comparison to the bubble model , this model ( model b+p ) gives a much improved , although still statistically unacceptable , simultaneous fit to the mos1 and mos2 data with @xmath106 ( @xmath107 dof ; table  [ tbl-1 ] , column 2 ) .",
    "the absorbed @xmath105@xmath11  kev flux in the western and eastern parts of 30 dor c are @xmath108 and @xmath109 erg s@xmath8 @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "these fluxes are slightly larger than the fluxes reported in @xcite for their regions 14 , due to the differences in the sizes of the regions used for extracting spectra between the present work and @xcite .",
    "we note that a marginal ( at greater than @xmath110% confidence  a @xmath111 result ) improvement in the fit is obtained when we allowed the normalization of the bubble model to be different between the eastern and western parts of 30 dor c.    the spectra of the diffuse x - ray emission in wind - blown bubbles have often been fitted to single temperature plasma models in collisional ionization equilibrium ( e.g. , dunne et al .",
    "2001 ) , although with little physical justification . in order to compare with these earlier observations and analyses ,",
    "we have replaced the bubble model with a single temperature mekal model .",
    "we have also fixed the metal abundance of the mekal at @xmath105 solar , since it is poorly constrained by the data .",
    "this model ( model m+p ) gives a similar quality fit to the data as the b+p model , with @xmath112 ( @xmath107 dof ; table  [ tbl-1 ] , column 3 ) .",
    "the best - fit equivalent hydrogen column densities and normalizations of the power - law continua are comparable to the values obtained from the fitting the data to the b+p model , and the best - fit temperature of the mekal is consistent with the value reported in @xcite for the thermal emission in their region 1 .",
    "we have also considered the possibility that the hard x - ray excess in 30 dor c is attributable to a second thermal component that might be caused by a recent supernova explosion , for example .",
    "we replaced the power - law component in the above m+p model with a second mekal model , with the metal abundances of the two mekals fixed at the same value of @xmath105 solar and the normalization of the high - temperature mekal allowed to vary between the eastern and western parts of 30 dor c. we find that this model provides a much worse fit to the data than do either the b+p or m+p models , with @xmath113 ( @xmath107 dof ) .",
    "this is due to the data at high energies being much too flat compared to the model .",
    "although a significant ( at greater than @xmath114% confidence ) improvement in the fit is obtained when we allowed the metal abundances of the two mekals to vary together , this model , with one extra free parameter , still provides a worse fit to the data than do either the b+p or m+p models , with @xmath115 ( @xmath116 dof ) .",
    "moreover , the metal abundance of @xmath117 solar is uncomfortably small for the ism in the lmc .",
    "more sophisticated models , such as the non - equilibrium , ionized ( nei ) plasma codes as implemented in xspec ( see e.g. , borkowski , lyerly , & reynolds 2001 for a detailed critique of these models ) , also gave poorer fits to the data than do either the b+p or m+p models .",
    "we therefore conclude that the hard x - ray excess in 30 dor c is best described by a nonthermal emission component .",
    "because 30 dor c is a massive star forming region with possible recent core - collapse supernovae occurring inside the bubble , we have further examined the data for an over - abundance of the @xmath17-process elements compared to fe - like elements .",
    "we did this by dividing the elements into two groups : the @xmath17-process elements o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , and ca ; and the remaining fe - like elements c , n , na , al , fe , and ni . elements in each group were constrained to have the same abundance relative to solar .",
    "the abundances of he and the fe - like elements were fixed at the solar and @xmath105 solar values , respectively , which are appropriate for the ism in the lmc @xcite .",
    "this model ( model vb+p ) further improves the fit to the mos1 and mos2 data with @xmath118 ( @xmath116 dof ; table  [ tbl-1 ] , column 3 ) .",
    "for clarity , we show the co - added mos spectra from the eastern and western parts of the bubble , together with the residuals to this model fit ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "there are some large residuals around the energies of the al k@xmath17 fluorescence line that arises from the detector housing and the au m - edge that arises from x - ray absorption in the telescope mirror surface . with the possible exception of si ,",
    "the @xmath17-process elemental abundance of @xmath119 solar ( errors here and elsewhere in this paper are 90% confidence for one interesting parameter , @xmath120 ) is higher than that of the ism in the lmc @xcite .",
    "there is no improvement ( at greater than 90% confidence ) in the fit when we allow the abundance of the fe - like elements to vary .",
    "although the model spectrum can still be rejected statistically at @xmath121% confidence , we consider the fit to be reasonably good .",
    "the model is certainly still an over - simplification .",
    "for example , we have assumed that the normalization of the soft bubble component is the same for both the eastern and western parts of 30 dor c. this assumption is problematic , however , since the power - law components of the two parts are very different .",
    "because of the heavy absorption , the data below @xmath80  kev does not allow us to independently constrain the bubble component in the western part of 30 dor c. dividing the data into the two parts ( east and west ) is an oversimplification ; in general , the transition from east to west must be gradual and so the parameters inferred from our model should be considered as averaged values within the divided regions .",
    "we have also not included any systematic error in the data due to uncertainties in the calibration , background subtraction , and modeling , which are difficult to quantify at present .",
    "we therefore decided not to add more complications ( such as varying abundances of individual elements ) into the model .",
    "the morphology of the diffuse x - ray emission in 30 dor c is consistent with that expected from the evaporation of cool gas into the hot interior of a bubble created in the ism by the winds of massive stars .",
    "the close confinement of the limb - brightened x - ray emission by the outer h@xmath17-emitting shell indicates that the bubble is roughly spherical . otherwise , the bubble has to be elongated almost exactly along the line of sight .",
    "we have therefore interpreted the x - ray emission in terms of the stellar wind - blown bubble model of @xcite .",
    "assuming that the above wind - blown bubble model provides a reasonable characterization of 30 dor c , the physical properties of the enclosed hot gas can be inferred from the spectral parameters obtained above .",
    "we have adopted a notation similar to @xcite , where @xmath122 is the age of the superbubble in myrs , @xmath123 is the ambient density of the ism in @xmath6 , @xmath124 is the equivalent mechanical power injected into the superbubble in units of @xmath125 erg s@xmath8 , and @xmath126 is the ratio of the coefficient of thermal conduction to the classical spitzer value ( @xmath127 erg s@xmath8 k@xmath8 cm@xmath8 ) .",

    "the central temperature and normalization of the best - fit bubble model ( model vb+p ) are @xmath136 and @xmath137 , respectively .",

    "stars with masses in the range from @xmath159 to @xmath158 are expected to undergo nuclear fusion of the @xmath17-elements and yield between @xmath160 and @xmath161 of oxygen @xcite . from the best - fit @xmath17-process elemental abundance of @xmath59 solar , we infer an oxygen / hydrogen mass ratio of @xmath162 for the x - ray emitting gas in the bubble .",
    "the ism in the lmc has an @xmath17-process elemental abundance of @xmath19 solar or an oxygen / hydrogen mass ratio of @xmath163 .",
    "thus , the bubble must have been enriched by @xmath164 of oxygen , assuming that @xmath165 percent of the mass of the x - ray emitting gas is hydrogen .",
    "at least 23 high ( @xmath166 ) mass , core - collapse supernovae are needed to explain the oxygen abundance in the bubble , and the total energy supplied exceeds the value inferred from the spectral fits .",

    "chu 2004 , private communication ) .",
    "the energy input from the ob association also tends to increase with time @xcite .",
    "the ages of the most massive stars in the ob association give an age of @xmath27@xmath71 myr @xcite , although there are subclusters that are older ( up to @xmath171  myr ) .",
    "this kind of progressive star formation is also seen in the central ob association of the nearby 30 dor nebula , typically with increasing strength ;",
    "i.e. , the most massive stars are formed later ( e.g. , selman et al .",
    "therefore , we adopt a mean age of the ob association as @xmath172 myrs .",
    "the inferred ambient density of @xmath173 is reasonable for the expected high density ism near 30 dor c.    the mean emission measure of the h@xmath17-emitting shell is @xmath174 @xmath141 pc @xcite . adopting a minimum path length of @xmath175 through the h@xmath17 emission region , which is twice as large as the width of the optical line - emitting filaments in figure  [ fig2 ]",

    "the thermal pressure of the ionized shell is approximately @xmath178 , where @xmath179 k and @xmath180 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "this value is within a factor of three of the thermal pressure derived from the x - ray data for filling factors in the range @xmath10@xmath80 .",
    "the mechanical luminosity required to power the bubble is @xmath181 .",
    "there are @xmath182 spectroscopically indentified o - type stars and @xmath183 confirmed w - r stars in lh  90 @xcite . while the mass loss rates of w - r stars can be an order of magnitude higher than those of o - type stars ( e.g. , nugis & lamers 2000 ) , the lifetime of these stars are fractions of a million years , i.e. , much shorter than the probable age of the bubble , and so their energy input to the bubble is negligible compared with that from the o - type stars . adopting a mean mass loss rate of @xmath184 ( de jager , nieuwenhuijzen , & van der hucht 1988 ) and terminal velocities in the range from @xmath185 to @xmath186 ( prinja , barlow , & howarth 1990 ) , which are typical values for the o - type stars in lh  90 , we calculate an integrated wind luminosity of @xmath187@xmath188 .",
    "therefore , the o - type stars in the stellar clusters of lh  90 could easily supply the mechanical luminosity required to power the bubble , without the contributions from a few supernovae .",
    "if the bubble is much older than @xmath71  myr , then the mechanical energy input to the bubble from the o - type stars could greatly exceed the value of @xmath189 inferred from the spectral fits .",
    "the best - fit bubble parameters give an estimate of the total energy input of @xmath190 .",
    "this energy input is inferred from the density and temperature structure of the bubble , and not from its mechanical luminosity and age .",
    "there is clearly discrepancy between the expected mechanical energy input from the ob association and that inferred from the bubble model .",
    "this apparent oversupply of mechanical energy is a common problem in the existing studies of several other structures around ob associations ( e.g. , oey 1996 ; naz et al .",
    "2001 ; cooper et al .",
    "in all these studies , including the present one , a potentially very important energy mechanism  dust grain cooling  is not considered .",
    "one expects dust grains to be mixed with the x - ray - emitting gas due to the thermal evaporation and supernova ejecta . with a normal interstellar dust grain population , the cooling rate of dust grains heated by collisions with hot electrons can be substantially greater than the radiative cooling of the hot gas itself ( e.g. , dwek & arendt 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "of course , dust grains subject to the sputtering .",
    "their survival timescale depend on both the grain sizes and the ambient hot gas density . with the large uncertainties in these parameters , we find that it is conceivable for dust grains to be the major coolant of a superbubble .",
    "we find a coefficient of thermal conduction of @xmath191 of the classical spitzer value .",
    "thermal conduction can be reduced by the presence of magnetic fields ( e.g. , chandran & cowley 1998 ) : the thermal conductivity can approach @xmath192% of the spitzer value due to the chaotic transverse wandering of the magnetic field lines , although this value could be uncertain by a factor of two @xcite . the theoretical value of @xmath126 is consistent with our measurement , given the uncertainties in the bubble age .",
    "thermal conduction is unlikely to be saturated ( e.g. , cowie & mckee 1977 ) , since the mean free path of a charge particle is much smaller than the radius of the bubble .",
    "as expected , the best - fit equivalent hydrogen column densities toward the eastern and western parts of 30 dor c are significantly higher than the equivalent galactic h  i column density toward 30 dor c of @xmath193 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we therefore use the optical extinction of stars in the ob association to independently estimate the total ( atomic plus molecular ) column density toward 30 dor c. the mean interstellar extinction for the association as a whole is @xmath194 and reaches a maximum of @xmath195 in the western part @xcite . adopting a value of @xmath196 for the galactic foreground extinction toward 30 dor c @xcite and assuming gas - to - dust ratios of @xmath197 ( bohlin , savage , & drake 1978 ) and @xmath198 @xcite for the galaxy and lmc respectively , we estimate a mean column density of @xmath199 toward the ob association and a maximum column density of @xmath200 toward the western part . while these values appear to be larger than our measurements , we had assumed solar abundances for the atomic absorption cross - sections in the spectral fits .",
    "almost all of the absorption cross - section at @xmath201 kev is provided by metals and so , for a metal abundance of @xmath105 solar , the measured x - ray absorption column densities towards the eastern and western parts of the bubble are @xmath202 @xmath2 and @xmath203 @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "these x - ray absorption column densities are consistent with the absorption column densities estimated from the optical extinction of stars in the ob association .",
    "the difference in the measured x - ray absorption column densities of @xmath204 @xmath2 is consistent with the h@xmath205 column density inferred from the co emission projected onto the western part of 30 dor c ( see   [ sec - morphology ] ) .",
    "for energy - conserving shocks , the h@xmath17 expansion velocity of @xmath206  km  s@xmath8 @xcite corresponds to a shock velocity of @xmath207  km  s@xmath8 ( e.g. , chu et al .",
    "1995b ) , and gas passing through the shock would only be heated to temperatures of @xmath208  k ( e.g. , hollenbach & mckee 1979 ) , which is well below the temperature of the x - ray emitting gas . the observed [ s ii]/h@xmath17 flux ratio of @xmath56 @xcite is also below that expected from shocked gas ( e.g. , long et al . 1990 ) and , contrary to the observations , the bulk of the nonthermal x - ray emission is expected to originate in the eastern part of 30 dor c since the non - thermal radio emission is much stronger on the eastern side of the bubble than on the western side .",
    "thus , we conclude that any recent supernova explosion must have occured deep inside the bubble , producing little or no observable nonthermal x - ray synchrotron radiation .",
    "@xcite explained the the apparently nonthermal component in the x - ray spectrum of 30 dor c as synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons .",
    "if this is true , the required electron energies should be a few hundred tev for a typical interstellar magnetic field of order @xmath209  g. although low ( up to a few tens of km s@xmath8 ) velocity shoulders are visible on the h@xmath17 emission lines from various parts of the bubble ( y .- h .",
    "chu 2004 , private communication ) , there is a complete lack of emission with velocities greater than @xmath75 km s@xmath8 from the recessional velocity of the lmc and so the shock velocities are certainly too low to produce such energetic particles .    the most obvious site for an effective particle acceleration should be the reverse shock , which separates the free - streaming stellar wind from the region of thermally evaporated material ( @xmath210 in fig .  1 of weaver et al . 1977 ) .",
    "for a mean mass loss rate of @xmath211 , a terminal velocity of @xmath212 , an ambient density of @xmath213 @xmath6 , and a bubble age of @xmath71 myrs , the inner shock radius is roughly @xmath183  pc @xcite .",
    "the time scales for the relativistic electrons to diffuse from the reverse shock to the edge of the bubble would have to be shorter than their synchrotron half - lives , which are of order @xmath214 ( e.g. , lang 1974 , pp .",
    "31 - 32 ) .",
    "the relativistic electrons would therefore have to travel in the bubble at velocities that are an order of magnitude faster than the sound velocity of @xmath215@xmath216 km s@xmath8 and two orders of magnitude faster than the alfvn velocity of @xmath217 km s@xmath8 , which is untenable ( e.g. , jaffe 1977 ) .",
    "it is possible that the electrons could be accelerated by turbulent motions in the bubble itself .",
    "the turbulent velocities would be of order or greater than the alfvn velocity , since otherwise the magnetic field would damp the turbulent motions ( e.g. , jaffe 1977 ) , and so the turbulent kinetic energy involved would be a few @xmath218 erg . the electrons must be accelerated on time scales that are shorter than their radiative lifetimes and so the power dissipated in this process is of order @xmath219 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "while this value is comparable to the mechanical wind luminosity of the early - type stars , the `` second - order '' acceleration by turbulence is probably too inefficient .",
    "the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and other ambient photons ( e.g. , infrared photons from reprocessed starlight ) by relativistic electrons will also generate nonthermal x - ray emission .",
    "the upscattering of such photons to @xmath220  kev requires electrons with energies in the range from @xmath221 to @xmath201  gev .",
    "these electrons radiate synchrotron emission at frequencies of mhz to tens of mhz in magnetic fields of order @xmath222 . for cmb photons , the ratio of inverse compton - scattered x - ray flux to radio synchrotron flux is @xmath223 ( e.g. , blumenthal & gould 1970 ) , where @xmath224 and @xmath225 are the flux densities at frequencies @xmath226 and @xmath227 , respectively . the functions @xmath228 and @xmath229 are given in @xcite for a power - law distribution of electron energies with index @xmath230 .",
    "the radio synchrotron spectrum should have the same spectral index as the ic emission and so we have assumed a spectral index of @xmath231 for the radio synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the ratio of @xmath228 to @xmath229 is @xmath232 for this value of @xmath17 .",
    "we have also assumed that the magnetic field strength is @xmath222 and that the electron distribution is an unbroken power - law extending from lorentz factors of few times @xmath216 , which will upscatter cmb photons to x - ray wavelengths , to lorentz factors of order @xmath233 , which will produce @xmath234  mhz radio emission via synchrotron radiation .",
    "this last assumption may not be correct , however , since the nonthermal x - ray emission is stongest in the western part of the bubble where there is no evidence for nonthermal radio emission @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the total ( thermal plus synchrotron ) emission at @xmath234  mhz is @xmath235  jy @xcite and so the expected 1  kev to @xmath234  mhz flux density ratio of @xmath236 gives an upper limit to the ic emission at 1  kev of @xmath237 photons @xmath2 s@xmath8 kev@xmath8 .",
    "although this value is consistent with the flux densities of the power - law emissions from the eastern and western parts of 30 dor c , the ic emission is probably much fainter than this , since the flat ( @xmath238 ) radio spectrum is an indication that the radio emission is mostly thermal @xcite .",
    "the upscattering of infrared photons to x - ray energies requires electrons with lorentz factors of a few hundred . for a power - law distribution of electron energies with index @xmath239",
    ", we would expect the number of electrons capable of upscattering infrared photons to x - ray energies to be @xmath215 times the number of electrons capable of upscattering cmb photons to x - ray energies .",
    "the @xmath240@xmath241 m luminosity of 30 dor c can be estimated from @xmath242 ( _ cataloged galaxies and quasars observed in the iras survey _ , appendix b ) , where @xmath243 and @xmath244 are the _ iras _ flux densities in jy at @xmath245 m and @xmath246 m , respectively , and @xmath96 is the distance to the source in cm . the extended infrared emission measured by _ iras _ is roughly @xmath43 and @xmath247 jy at @xmath248 and @xmath249 m , respectively @xcite , and so we estimate a @xmath240@xmath250 m luminosity of the order of a few @xmath125 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "thus , the mean infrared energy density of the bubble is of the order @xmath251 erg @xmath6 and could be higher if the infrared emission is concentrated in the outer shell . if we adopt a mean photon energy of @xmath252 ev for the infrared emission , then the total infrared photon number density is @xmath253 @xmath6 .",
    "the cmb photons have , in contrast , a mean photon energy of @xmath254 ev and a total photon number density of @xmath255 @xmath6 ( e.g. , gaiser , protheroe , & stanev 1998 ) . from equation ( 6 ) of @xcite and assuming that the electron energies are distributed as a power - law of index @xmath239 , we find that the ic emission at a fixed photon energy scales roughly as @xmath256 , where @xmath257 is the photon number density of the radiation under consideration",
    ". so we would expect the x - ray emission from ic - scattered infrared photons to be @xmath258 percent higher than that from the upscattering of the cmb photons .",
    "however , the optical radiation from stars should have an energy density greater than that of the infrared emission and could be ic - scattered to x - ray energies by electrons with lorentz factors of @xmath259 . if we assume that the mean energy of the optical photons is @xmath260 ev , then the total photon number density of the optical radiation should be @xmath261 @xmath6 and the x - ray emission from ic - scattered optical photons should be an order of magnitude higher than that from the upscattered infrared and cmb photons .",
    "unless the particle energy distribution is far from the power law ( e.g. , a maxwellian distribution ) and/or the particle population is greatly enhanced at the shell , the nonthermal x - ray emission should then be concentrated in the central region of 30 dor c , where the optical emission is greatest .",
    "this is inconsistent with the observed limb - brightened hard x - ray emission ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) . a strong shock ,",
    "as expected inside the bubble , will also produce electron spectra with indexes of @xmath262 ( e.g. , blandford & eichler 1987 ) , which is totally at odds with the spectral index of the nonthermal x - ray emission . on the other hand ,",
    "if the relativistic particles represent the thermalized wind material from young pulsars during the lifetime of the bubble , then the particle energies could be distributed as a maxwellian of peak energy @xmath263@xmath216 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can not rule out the possibility that the bulk of the nonthermal x - ray emission from the bubble is due to ic radiation .",
    "nonthermal particles generate bremsstrahlung in regions where the energy losses due to ionization and coulomb collisions are significant .",
    "the energy flux of the bremsstrahlung radiation is @xmath264 times the total energy input to the particles ( e.g. , dogiel et al .",
    "2002 ) , i.e. , a large amount of energy is required to maintain the particles against coulomb / ionization losses to the emitting region .",
    "the best - fit bubble model ( model vb+p ) has power - law components with unabsorbed @xmath10@xmath11  kev luminosities of @xmath265 and @xmath266 erg s@xmath8 in the eastern and western parts of the bubble , respectively .",
    "the required energy input is therefore @xmath267@xmath268 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "although the necessary energy input can be less than this for a quasi - thermal distribution of electrons formed in regions of in situ acceleration @xcite , it is still orders of magnitude greater than the integrated wind luminosity of @xmath201-@xmath269 erg s@xmath8 from the o - type stars in lh  90 . a recent ( within the last a few @xmath270 years ; chu & maclow 1990 ) supernova explosion could provide the energy input to the bubble , but this would mean that we are seeing the event by chance .",
    "the 26 o - type stars in lh  90 have masses in the range from @xmath271 to @xmath272 ( e.g. , walborn et al .",
    "1995 , 1999 ) .",
    "if we assume a spitzer initial mass function for the stars in lh  90 , then we would expect @xmath159 o - type stars with masses in the range from @xmath273 to @xmath274 .",
    "although some of these stars would undoubtedly have evolved into w - r stars , the remainder would have exploded as supernovae ( stars with masses greater than @xmath275 do not explode as supernovae , but instead collapse into a black - hole ) .",
    "thus , there must have been at least @xmath157@xmath276 supernovae in 30 dor c , and so the probability of seeing a supernova within the last @xmath233 years is approximately @xmath80 percent , assuming that the age of the bubble is @xmath71 myr .",
    "in summary , the nature of the apparent nonthermal hard x - ray component is still uncertain .",
    "the expansion of the bubble is much too slow in order to produce the energetic particles necessary for nonthermal x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "although such energetic particles can be produced at the inner reverse shock , they can not cross the bubble within their synchrotron half - lives .",
    "nonthermal bremsstrahlung is an inefficient process , requiring at least three orders of magnitude more energy than can be supplied by the o - type stars in lh  90 .",
    "a recent supernova could supply the necessary energy , but this would mean that we are seeing the event by chance ( a probability of @xmath277 percent ) . the ic scattering of cmb and infrared photons can not account for all of the nonthermal x - ray emission unless the radio flux is purely synchrotron radiation , which seems unlikely .",
    "while the x - ray emission from ic - scattered optical photons should be much higher than that from ic - scattered cmb and infrared photons , it should be concentrated in the central region of 30 dor c , where the optical photon density is greatest , in sharp contrast to the data .",
    "the nonthermal x - ray emission could instead be due to the ic scattering of cmb and infrared photons by relativistic particles originating in young pulsar wind material with energies peaking between @xmath263@xmath216 .",
    "high spatial resolution x - ray imaging , which can be afforded by an on - axis _",
    "chandra _ observation , will be particularly useful to further the understanding of the component",
    ". such an observation will allow for an accurate determination of the size and geometry of the x - ray - emitting region and for a detailed comparison with images in other wavelength bands .",
    "a substantial fraction of the expected energy input from stellar winds and supernovae may be radiated in the infrared by dust grains entrained in the hot gas .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of _ xmm - newton _ observations of the superbubble 30 dor c and compare the results with the predictions from the standard wind - blown bubble model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the observed x - ray spectra can not be fitted satisfactorily with the model alone and that there is evidence for nonthermal x - ray emission , which is particularly important at @xmath0  kev . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of the bubble model and a power - law gives a reasonable fit to the observed spectra . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal pressure and central temperature of the bubble are @xmath1 dyne @xmath2 and @xmath3  k , respectively , and we infer that , for a bubble age of @xmath4 years , the ambient density is @xmath5 @xmath6 , the mechanical luminosity is @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 , and the coefficient of thermal conductivity is @xmath9 of the spitzer value . the total unabsorbed @xmath10@xmath11  kev luminosities of the eastern and western parts of the bubble are @xmath12 erg s@xmath8 and @xmath13 erg s@xmath8 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the unabsorbed @xmath10@xmath11  kev luminosity of the bubble model is @xmath14 erg s@xmath8 and so the power - law component contributes between @xmath15 and @xmath16 to the total unabsorbed luminosity in this energy band . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the hard nonthermal emission is not clear , although recent supernovae in the bubble may be responsible . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that about one or two core - collapse supernovae could have occured and are required to explain the enrichment of the hot gas , as evidenced by the overabundance of @xmath17-elements by a factor of @xmath18 , compared to the mean value of @xmath19 solar for the interstellar medium in the large magellanic cloud . as in previous studies of various superbubbles , </S>",
    "<S> the amount of energy currently present in 30 dor c is significantly less than the expected energy input from the enclosed massive stars over their lifetime . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that a substantial fraction of the input energy may be radiated in far - infrared by dust grains , which are mixed with the hot gas because of the thermal conduction and/or dynamic mixing . </S>"
