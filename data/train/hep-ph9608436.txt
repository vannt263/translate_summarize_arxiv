    "the top quark certainly is one of the most interesting of the presently known elementary particles , partly because it is the one we know least of , but also because its large mass implies that we can use it for a variety of unprecedented qcd studies .",
    "a future 500 @xmath0 collider will provide a clean laboratory where we can investigate the top quark s properties to a high precision by performing a detailed analysis of its production close to threshold .",
    "it is thus not surprising to find a long series of papers concerned with this subject , i.e.  @xcite@xcite , leading to the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the excitation curve @xmath1 , i.e.  the total cross - section for @xmath2-production , allows for a precise measurement of @xmath3 and the top quark mass .",
    "this is in analogy to the charmonium and bottomonium systems with the difference that perturbative qcd is far more reliable in the @xmath2 system because of the considerably higher scale and , as will be explained below , the large top quark width .",
    "2 .   the momentum distribution @xmath4 and the forward - backward asymmetry will provide a second , independent determination of @xmath5 and also measure the top quark width @xmath6 and consequently give us a handle on @xmath7 or physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the size of the top quark polarization , which is predicted to amount to @xmath8 even for unpolarized beams , is governed by the top quark s couplings to the @xmath9-boson and the photon .",
    "hence its measurement will give us information about these presently unknown parameters .",
    "we will also gain some information about the qcd potential , which determines the dynamics of the nonrelativistic `` toponium '' system .",
    "when compared with charmonium and bottomonium there seems to be a big problem connected to the top quark , caused by its enormous width of about 1.5 : the heavy quarks will decay before resonances can build up and thus we wo nt see narrow peaks in @xmath1 . furthermore , the width can not be neglected in calculations .",
    "but as fadin and khoze pointed out several years ago @xcite , this obstacle in fact turns out to be an advantage , because it implies that top decays before hadronization effects can spoil the purely perturbative behaviour . the width acts as an infrared cutoff and protects us from the poorly known physics at large distances .",
    "in addition , the study of momentum distributions and top polarization is only made possible by the dominance of the single quark decay . @xmath10 and @xmath11 for example mainly decay via @xmath12 annihilation and thus all information about momentum distributions is lost .    in the following section",
    "i will briefly describe the calculation of the cross - section for @xmath2 production including terms of the order @xmath13 .",
    "these results are however inconsistent without the inclusion of @xmath14 corrections , which i will present in section 3 for the differential cross - section and in section 4 for the top quark polarization .",
    "i will not dwell too much on the technical parts of the calculation .",
    "the reader who is interested in more details is advised to read @xcite .",
    "close to threshold it is convenient to employ a nonrelativistic approximation and use the corresponding variables : the top quark three - momentum in the laboratory frame @xmath15 , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and the energy measured from nominal threshold @xmath18 .",
    "we will also need the angle @xmath19 between the top and electron beam directions and the three unit vectors @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 which are defined in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    ".    in the kinematic regime @xmath23 one usually encounters the problem that coulomb gluon exchange is not suppressed because @xmath24 is not a small parameter and thus all terms of the form @xmath25 have to be summed up .",
    "this is usually solved by using the schrdinger equation to calculate the wave - functions for the bound states and expressing the observables in terms of the latter . in the @xmath2 system",
    "there is however the additional complication already mentioned : the large width which can not be neglected . as a consequence",
    "there will be no isolated resonances in the cross - section and thus the usage of wave - functions is very inconvenient , because lots of them would have to be summed , including interferences .",
    "the idea of fadin and khoze @xcite to circumvent this was to use the green function instead , which by construction is a sum over all wave - functions : @xmath26    a method to see this function appear in a diagrammatical approach in momentum space is as follows : one can express the fact that all gluon exchanges have to be summed ( in ladder approximation ) in the form of self - consistency equations for the vertex functions @xmath27 , with @xmath28 or @xmath29 in the case of interest for @xmath0 annihilation , @xmath30 which are also shown in fig .",
    "[ lseq ] . in the nonrelativistic approximation , neglecting terms of the order @xmath31 , they can essentially be reduced to the integral equations @xmath32 the functions @xmath33 in turn are tightly connected to the green function @xmath34 which solves the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath35          { \\cal g } ( \\bfp,\\bfx , e ) = e^{i \\bfp \\cdot \\bfx } +          \\int { d^3 k \\over ( 2 \\pi)^3 } v(\\bfp - \\bfk )          { \\cal g } ( \\bfk,\\bfx , e ) : \\ ] ] expanding @xmath34 in a taylor series around @xmath36 we find @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 @xmath40 and @xmath41 thus are the @xmath42- and @xmath43-wave green functions , respectively .",
    "they form the nontrivial dynamical ingredients for the production cross - section which is otherwise completely determined by electroweak coupling constants . for a realistic potential they have to be determined numerically , and it turns out convenient to perform this calculation directly in momentum space using a method introduced in @xcite .",
    "we will employ the following conventions for the fermion couplings @xmath44 and the useful abbreviations @xmath45 @xmath46 denotes the longitudinal positron / electron polarization and the variable @xmath47 is defined as @xmath48 with these parameters the differential cross - section for the production of a @xmath2 pair with a top quark of three - momentum @xmath15 and spin projection @xmath49 on direction * n * can be written in the form @xmath50",
    "@xmath51 denotes the ( momentum dependent ) forward - backward asymmetry and * p * can be interpreted as top quark polarization vector .",
    "these quantities are given by @xmath52 with @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "they have first been derived for polarized beams in @xcite , apart from p@xmath58 which has been supplemented in @xcite .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry has been calculated first , for unpolarized beams , in @xcite .",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath59 are displayed in figure [ cx ] . it is not difficult to see that for small @xmath13 the top quark spin is mainly aligned with the electron beam direction , apart from corrections of order @xmath13 that depend on the production angle @xmath19 .",
    "however , the size of these @xmath60 corrections is not really given by the expressions above , although they are correct in a formal sense .",
    "close to threshold @xmath61 and consequently @xmath14 terms might be as large , or put another way , they should be included in the @xmath60 analysis .",
    "some of these qcd corrections are not too difficult to implement because they are universal .",
    "the @xmath62 and @xmath63 vertex corrections caused by the exchange of transverse gluons for example can be incorporated to the required order by simply multiplying with the following factors @xcite : @xmath64 resulting in a corresponding modification in the definition of @xmath65 .",
    "corrections to the individual top decays can be accounted for by using the 1-loop result for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "there is however a type of corrections which is more difficult because it connects the different stages of the production and subsequent decay process .",
    "i will call them `` rescattering corrections '' , the corresponding diagrams are depicted in figure [ fig : resc ] ( in principle there is a third diagram with gluon exchange between the two @xmath66-quarks , which can however be neglected to the required order @xcite ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in addition i should mention that @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 could be interpreted as additional @xmath42- , @xmath43- and @xmath70-wave contributions , a viewpoint motiviated by the way they are defined and the way they enter the expressions .",
    "figures [ plong ] and [ pperp ] show the predictions for the subleading term of the longitudinal polarization and for the transverse part , respectively .",
    "the solid and dash - dotted lines correspond to the full result for unpolarized / fully polarized beams , the dashed and dotted lines to the @xmath60 term only .",
    "it is quite evident that rescattering has a strong influence on the result , which is due to the fact that the @xmath71-terms are suppressed by ratios of electroweak couplings appearing in the coefficients @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 are of comparable size as they should be because @xmath76 .",
    "in this paper i have discussed recent results on observables in top quark pair production near threshold at @xmath0 colliders .",
    "i have sketched the calculational procedure used to derive the predictions for the differential cross - section and top quark polarization for arbitrary beam polarization which are correct up to terms of the order @xmath77 because they also include the rescattering corrections .",
    "the method of moments proved to be a very useful tool , which could of course also be used for other production mechanisms or far above threshold .",
    "it turned out that rescattering corrections are not generically small and are indeed required for a consistent prediction of the components of the top quark polarization vector lying in the production plane .",
    "they are of minor importance for the forward - backward asymmetry but might nevertheless be visible in precision studies , especially if polarized beams are used .",
    "an important result was that there are no corrections to the normal polarization .",
    "this component is of special interest because it is the place where non - standard cp violating interactions would manifest themselves . in connection with the leading term of p@xmath78 , which can be measured by averaging over the top direction , i.e.  via @xmath79",
    ", it provides an opportunity to determine the top quark couplings @xmath80 .",
    "i would like to express my gratitude to the organizers of the xxxvi cracow school of theoretical physics , especially m. jeabek , for their invitation and for providing such a nice atmosphere .",
    "i would also like to thank j.h .",
