    "new perovskite - type materials exhibiting very high values of the dielectric permittivity @xmath2   in a very wide temperature interval discovered during last years open a new promising possibility for wide applications ( the best known example is cacu@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 which has @xmath2   about 10000 which is nearly independent on temperature in the extremely wide temperature range , 100 - 500 k , both in ceramic and single crystal forms @xcite ) .",
    "such characteristics are of great interest for practice and several possible mechanisms have been already proposed @xcite . at present",
    "it seems that the origin of the high dielectric permittivity is not intrinsic ( as no anomalies in crystal lattice have been revealed by spectral and structural studies ) but rather extrinsic , most probably- due to polarization of the maxwell - wagner type , but the origin and the scale of the concomitant electrical and/or chemical inhomogeneities are still under debate .",
    "recently high values of @xmath2   were reported for ceramic samples of ternary perovskite bafe@xmath0nb@xmath0o@xmath3 ( bfn ) and it was supposed that bfn is a relaxor ferroelectric [ 5 ] . however , a close look into the temperature dependence of @xmath2   obtained in ref . [ @xcite ] and shown in fig .",
    "1 ( dotted line ) , as well as the frequency dependencies of both the real @xmath2   and imaginary @xmath6   parts of dielectric permittivity resemble those observed for cacu@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath7 .",
    "this casts some doubts on the validity of the consequence made in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] about the ferroelectric relaxor nature of the phenomenon observed .",
    "the scope of the present work is the dielectric permittivity studies of afe@xmath0b@xmath0o@xmath3 ( a - ba , sr , ca ; b - nb , ta , sb ) in order to elucidate the nature of the high values of the dielectric permittivity in bfn and similar ceramics . for this purpose",
    "we also studied the electric field and temperature dependencies of electric current .",
    "we found out that all the ceramics studied exhibit large dielectric permittivity in a wide temperature interval and that a maxwell - wagner mechanism is responsible for these high values .",
    "the ceramic samples of afe@xmath0b@xmath0o@xmath3   were prepared by routine solid - state reaction route .",
    "the calculated quantities of appropriate carbonates and oxides were mixed thoroughly in an agate mortar in the presence of ethyl alcohol . then the synthesis was carried out for 4 hours at 1000 - 1100 @xmath8 . after the synthesis the product of reaction",
    "was crushed and mixed in an agate mortar as described above .",
    "usually 1wt.% of cubic boron nitride , bn , was added to the synthesized powder as a sintering aid .",
    "the green ceramic samples were pressed , at 100 mpa , in the form of disks of 5 to 10 mm in diameter and of 2 - 4 mm in height .",
    "final sintering was carried out at @xmath9 .",
    "pellets were placed on pt foil .",
    "the density of the ceramics obtained was about 90 - 95 % of theoretical one .",
    "the absence of non - perovskite phases was monitored by x - ray diffraction .",
    "the electrodes for measurements were deposited to the grinded disk surfaces by rubbing the in - ga alloy .",
    "the dielectric studies were carried out in the 0.1 - 100 khz range in the course of both heating and cooling at a rate of 2 -3 @xmath10   with the aid of the r5083 capacitance bridge .    in order to avoid the joule heating of the sample , volt - ampere characteristics of the semiconducting ceramics",
    "were studied by the pulse method with the aid of oscilloscope using the triangular - shaped voltage pulses .",
    "the resistivity @xmath11   of ceramics obtained depends on the sintering temperature .",
    "the lowest @xmath11   values @xmath12 10@xmath13- 10@xmath14   were observed for cafe@xmath0nb@xmath0o@xmath3   ceramics sintered at @xmath15   while at lower sintering temperatures much higher @xmath11 values were obtained .",
    "other dielectric perovskite - type oxides usually have @xmath16 10@xmath17 - 10@xmath18   at room temperature .",
    "the type of conductivity was determined by the seebeck method for the most conductive samples and was found to be @xmath19 for all compounds studied .",
    "the apparent @xmath20   values of ceramics depend on the measuring field .",
    "2 shows the dependences of current density @xmath21   on the electric field @xmath22   for three bfn ceramic samples having differing apparent @xmath11   values at room temperature . at high @xmath22 s the @xmath21   on @xmath22   dependence is nonlinear and follows the @xmath23   relation where exponent @xmath24   varies from 3 to 5 for different samples .",
    "such behavior is typical of ceramic varistors , i.e. ceramics with highly conducting grain bulk and poorly conducting grain boundary and/or intergranular layers [ 6,7 ] .",
    "small @xmath24   values ( @xmath25 ) at low @xmath22 s are usually attributed to carriers hopping along the grain boundaries .",
    "it is worth noting that the same @xmath21   vs. @xmath22   curves may be fitted rather well by other types of dependences , e.g. @xmath26   with @xmath27   or @xmath28   etc .",
    "various mechanisms of non - linear charge transport across the grain boundary barriers have been suggested for oxide semiconductors and are still under debate ( see [ 6,7 ] and references therein ) .",
    "discussions of these mechanisms is out of the scope of the present work .",
    "it is only essential for us that our experiment shows that the ceramics under study are electrically inhomogeneous .",
    "one more important conclusion follows from the large values of @xmath22   corresponding to the onset of the highly - nonlinear portions of the @xmath29   dependences .",
    "this fact implies that the samples studied contain a large number of high - resistive layers and the role of possible blocking layer at the sample / electrode interface is negligible .",
    "qualitatively similar @xmath29   dependencies were observed for all the afe@xmath0b@xmath0o@xmath3   ceramics studied provided that the samples have low enough apparent resistivity .",
    "1 displays the @xmath30   and @xmath31   dependences for three bfn samples having differing apparent resistivity at room temperature ( see table 1 ) . as both @xmath2   and @xmath32   change by several orders of magnitude the semilogarithmic scale is used .",
    "the @xmath29   dependences for bfn-1 and bfn-2 samples are similar to curves 2 and 3 in fig.2 respectively , while no highly - nonlinear portions were observed on the @xmath29   dependence of the bfn-3 sample in the available range of @xmath22   values ( up to 300 v / mm ) .",
    "all the @xmath30   dependences obtained are similar to those observed for the so - called high - k materials @xcite : @xmath30   has a step and , above the temperature of this step , @xmath2   are nearly independent on @xmath33 . only at high temperatures",
    "one can see a small increase of @xmath2 .",
    "the bfn-1 and bfn-2 samples have very similar @xmath2   values and @xmath30   dependences ; @xmath34   of bfn-1 is somewhat higher with respect to bfn-2 , especially at room temperature and above ( fig .",
    "1 ) . these higher @xmath34   values may be attributed to higher apparent conductivity of bfn-1 .    both the @xmath30   steps and @xmath35   maxima shift to higher temperatures as the measuring frequency , @xmath36 , increases ( figs . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "both the @xmath30   and @xmath35   maximum temperature , @xmath37 , dependences on @xmath36   plotted in the arrhenius coordinates are linear ( fig .",
    "4 ) which is typical of debye - type relaxation . the activation energies @xmath38   determined from either of these dependences are very similar ( fig .",
    "4 ) .    as temperature decreases ,",
    "@xmath30   curves of all the three bfn samples tend to converge . from our data",
    "the low - temperature limit of @xmath2   may be estimated as 40 - 60 .",
    "this value seems to be somewhat lower if the measurements would be extended to lower temperatures and/or higher frequencies .",
    "the high - frequency value of @xmath2   for bfn is close to the estimate @xmath39   obtained using the linear correlation between the @xmath2   values measured in the submillimeter frequency range and tolerance - factor @xmath40 , revealed for @xmath41   perovskites @xcite ( r@xmath42 , r@xmath43 and r@xmath44 stand for the ionic radii of the @xmath45 , @xmath46   and @xmath47   ions respectively ) .",
    "5 shows the @xmath30   and @xmath48   dependences for several a@xmath49fe@xmath0b@xmath0o@xmath3   ceramics .",
    "these curves as well as the arrhenius plots of the frequency dependence of the @xmath48   maximum temperature ( fig.6 ) are very much alike the corresponding dependences for bfn",
    ". for all the a@xmath49fe@xmath0b@xmath0o@xmath3   perovskites studied the low - temperature values of @xmath2   are close to that of bfn ceramics .",
    "note that the temperature at which the @xmath30   step is observed and the activation energy of relaxation depend on the apparent resistivity values of the samples .",
    "such behavior is typical of the maxwell - wagner relaxation and below we shall give some additional arguments in favour of this conclusion .",
    "in the simplest version of the maxwell - wagner relaxation model one can consider alternating slabs having different dielectric permittivities ( @xmath50 and @xmath51   and different conductivities ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 , so that the complex permittivities in these slabs are :    @xmath54    at small conductivities the total dielectric permittivity can be approximated by    @xmath55    where @xmath56   and @xmath57   are the widths of the first and second slabs respectively , and @xmath58 .",
    "then we consider expression ( [ eq2 ] ) where , for the sake of simplicity , only the first slab is conducting .",
    "this slab corresponds to the grain bulk while the nonconducting slab is the grain boundary .",
    "we assume that the temperature dependence of electroconductivity in the conducting grains is semiconducting    @xmath59    where @xmath60   is the electroconductivity activation energy ( this energy can vary for different samples depending on the degree of the donor - acceptor compensation ) .",
    "this assumption corresponds to our experimental data on electroconductivity .",
    "equating @xmath56 and @xmath61   ( this is true for thin interfacial layers between grains ) one can obtain    @xmath62    where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65   being the relative width of the interfacial layers @xmath66 .",
    "the frequency dependence of the dielectric permittivity can be observed if only @xmath67 .",
    "this can happen in the case if the nonconductive layers are very thin that corresponds to our assumption about the grain boundaries , and if the dielectric permittivity of the conductive region is not very large with respect to the nonconductive one , and this also corresponds to our data showing comparatively ( with ferroelectrics ) low values of the permittivity at low temperatures and large frequences .    at zero frequency",
    "one can find    @xmath68    that is the dielectric permittivity is controlled by the thin nonconducting layer . in the case of ceramics considered in the present paper",
    "this can be boundaries of the grains .",
    "for example , if the grain is about 10 @xmath69 m , the boundary region is about 100 a , and @xmath70   then @xmath71 .",
    "this can explain the high values of the dielectric permittivity in bfn .",
    "for instance , at @xmath72 , one can obtain the high frequency limit @xmath73   which corresponds to our experimental data .",
    "it follows from ( [ eq4 ] ) that the temperature dependence of the relaxation time @xmath74 can be described by the arrhenius law , in which the barrier height coincides with the electroconductivity activation energy in the grain s bulk :    @xmath75    where @xmath76 .",
    "this fact corresponds to the experimental data showing a close relation of the electroconductivity in the bulk of the grains to the relaxation time ( see section 3 ) .",
    "due to temperature dependence ( [ eq6 ] ) the real part of the dielectric permittivity should increase at a temperature determined by the relation @xmath77   and at larger temperatures it should saturate that is in agreement with experiment .",
    "the greater is the frequency , the larger is the temperature where the real part of the permittivity becomes rapidly growing and the imaginary part has a maximum .",
    "these data are in excellent agreement with the experiment performed .",
    "the microscopic model we use bases on the assumption that the high - temperature treatment of the ceramics under study results in the creation of oxygen vacancies which have weakly bound electrons .",
    "the semiconductor conductivity connected with these electrons contributes into electric polarization and results in the appearance of a step in @xmath2   and a maximum in @xmath78 .",
    "we assumed that the interfacial layers at the grain boundaries are nonconducting ( or less conducting ) while the bulk of the grains is conducting .",
    "just this fact together with the relatively small total width of the grain boundaries in the direction of the field provides the large values of the dielectric permittivity in the ceramics studied .",
    "both the resistivity dependence on sintering temperature and varistor - like @xmath29 characteristics of the afe@xmath0b@xmath79o@xmath3   ceramics seem to be due to partial reduction of these compounds at high temperatures ( where the partial o@xmath80   pressure in air is lower than the equilibrium partial o@xmath80   pressure in oxide ) .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the @xmath19-type of conductivity in all the ceramics studied . in the course of cooling",
    "reoxidation takes place .",
    "as the oxygen diffusion coefficient at grain boundaries is much larger than in the bulk , the degree of oxidation and subsequent resistivity is higher in the grain boundary layers than in the grain bulk .    as one",
    "can see from table 1 , the activation energies of the relaxation frequency are several times lower than the activation energies extracted from the temperature dependence of @xmath20 .",
    "the former energy coincides with the activation energy of grain bulk conductivity ( see expression ( [ eq6 ] ) ) while the latter is determined by the grain boundary barrier height .",
    "the same situation is observed in cacu@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5   ceramics where the resistivities of grain bulk and grain boundaries have been directly determined via the impedance spectroscopy [ 4 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the activation energies observed for the relaxation time have the same order of magnitude as the activation energies of the first ( hundredths of ev ) and the second ( tenths of ev ) levels of the oxygen vacancy in perovskites [ 10,11 ] .",
    "similar effects , i.e. a crucial dependence of resistivity on sintering temperature and the formation of grain boundary barrier layers due to reoxidation have been observed in related compounds pbfe@xmath0nb@xmath0o@xmath1   and pbfe@xmath0ta@xmath79o@xmath1  @xcite .",
    "both these perovskites are ferroelectrics and the presence of grain boundary barriers in a ceramic sample can be monitored by studying the positive temperature coefficient of resistivity ( ptcr ) effect , an anomalous decrease of resistivity on cooling below the ferroelectric curie point , @xmath81 . in the paraelectric phase the properties of these materials at low frequencies",
    "are determined mainly by grain boundaries : the extremely high permittivity values ( though depending on temperature due to the curie - weiss behavior of @xmath2   typical of ferroelectrics ) , varistor effect , and high apparent resistivity exhibiting large activation energy were observed .",
    "below @xmath81 , the grain boundary barriers are screened , more or less effectively , due to onset of the spontaneous polarization .",
    "this results in low resistivity values characterized by small activation energies which are determined by the grain bulk and relatively small residual grain boundary barriers .",
    "the average grain size in all the bfn ceramics studied was approximately the same ( a few @xmath69 m ) and the increase of the @xmath22   values corresponding to the onset of the highly - nonlinear portions on the @xmath29   curves of the samples with lower apparent conductivity is likely to be caused by the increase of the thickness of the poorly conducting grain boundary layers .",
    "this assumption correlates well ( taking into account expression ( [ eq5 ] ) ) with experimentally observed lower values of @xmath2   for the bfn-3 sample as compared with more conductive bfn-2 and bfn-1 .",
    "it follows from expressions ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) that the temperature behavior of @xmath82   can have whether a maximum ( at low frequency or at high conductivity ) or a step ( at large frequency or at low conductivity ) .",
    "there can be also intermediate behavior with a step and a maximum just at the step .",
    "this corresponds to the experiment performed as it is seen from figs .",
    "1 and 6 .    fig .",
    "7 presents the fit of expression ( [ eq4 ] ) to experimental data obtained for bfn2 .",
    "the activation energy of the relaxation process obtained from this fit is 0.09 ev that is in excellent agreement with the experimental data obtained from the arrhenius plot .",
    "we want to stress here that the debye - type relaxation described above differs from the usual debye relaxation connected with the reversal of local dipoles appreciably . in the case of the local dipoles",
    "@xmath83   and this explains the vanishing of the relaxation contribution to the dielectric permittivity at high temperatures .",
    "the real part of the dielectric permittivity in this case has a maximum and the temperature width of the relaxation anomaly is usually not very large .",
    "we expect such a situation for low - conducting samples where the conducting regions are so small that one can not substitute the complex system by a series of capacitors .",
    "rather simple arithmetic averaging of dielectric permittivity should be done . in this case one",
    "immediately obtains a lanjevin function describing polarization , and , at zero measuring field , the permittivity is @xmath84   where @xmath57   is the width of the polar region along the field , @xmath85   is the electron charge , and @xmath19   is the oxygen vacancy concentration . notice that this result is obtained not because of the averaging of polarization over the possible dipole directions in 3d space as it is true for local dipoles but rather because of averaging of polarization with respect to the displacement of an electron from the oxygen vacancy along the field .",
    "the real part of the dielectric permittivity has a maximum in this case like in the case of local dipoles and the susceptibility decreases with temperature above the maximum as 1/@xmath33 .",
    "we have considered a monodispersive debye model .",
    "however it can be easily generalized by considering a distribution function of the relaxation times .",
    "there can be a few relaxation processes connected with different electron s states .",
    "they can lead to different maximums or steps in the imaginary part of permittivity in different temperature intervals .",
    "the spatial dependence of the parameters of the model can be taken into account by introducing a distribution function for the relaxation times and energy barriers .",
    "we want to discuss here a possibility of the existence of a maxwell - wagner relaxation in single crystals .",
    "indeed , such relaxation was observed in single crystals of cacu@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath7[1,2 ] and erfe@xmath80o@xmath4   @xcite . in principle",
    "this effect could be due to electrodes and a depletion region near them . in our case",
    "we used inga electrodes which do not produce such an effect in the case of the n - type conductivity found in our samples .",
    "another possibility can be connected with the fact that all high - k materials contain transition metal ions with open shells like fe ( in our case and in erfe@xmath80o@xmath86 or cu ( in cacu@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath87 .",
    "below we will discus a few of possible consequences of this fact .",
    "the oxygen vacancies are comparatively easily created at the transition metals in perovskites and they are ordered @xcite .",
    "this can result in the appearance of reduced regions in the bulk at the transition metals and these regions can organize clusters and participate in the conductivity .",
    "the ordered arrays of the vacancies can play the role of conducting layers .",
    "the electronic band structure of afe@xmath0b@xmath0o@xmath1   ( a- ba , sr , ca ; b - nb , ta , sb ) is very different in comparison with the electronic structure of abo@xmath3   perovskites @xcite . indeed",
    "the width of conduction bands in the abo@xmath3   crystals is mainly determined by the covalent bonding of the @xmath88   metal and o2@xmath89   oxygen electronic states . at the fe ions",
    "the covalent bonding is reduced due to the localized character of the fe @xmath90-states .",
    "this effect should decrease the width of the conduction bands [ 16 ] and produce some percolative clusters made of conducting states .",
    "the electrons from the vacancies caught by these clusters can participate in charge transfer within these clusters .",
    "the charges of fe@xmath91   and b@xmath92   ( b - nb , ta , sb ) are very different , and this also can lead to the appearance of clusters of electronic conduction states having decreased energy .",
    "one can consider conductivity percolation in samples after different thermal treatment : for well conductive samples the percolative clusters are big while for less conductive clusters they are smaller .",
    "finally , one can consider electron s jumps over the m - o bands ( m = cu or fe ) . due to a small oxygen vacancy concentration this conductivity is prevented by the strong electron correlation on the metal ions . as a result",
    "the electrons can be caught by some finite regions having random barriers which are higher than the barriers inside these volumes .    in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] the authors proposed the appearance of nonconducting ( or less conducting ) layers due to a magnetic phase transition and following domain formations : the domain walls can play the role of the nonconducting dielectric layers .",
    "one can extend this idea by considering also antiferroelectric or elastic phase transitions .",
    "studies of the electron doping on the dielectric properties of perovskite materials were carried out in pioneering papers @xcite .",
    "it was not ambiguously shown that electrons and polarons can contribute much to the dielectric permittivity of perovskites and , at some conditions , produse a temprature maximums of the dielectric permittivity . from our study",
    "it follows that such `` polaronic - type '' relaxation is possible in the case when the polar regions where the electron concentration is enhanced for some reasons are not very large . in this case",
    "these regions show the same characteristics as local orientable dipoles in relaxors .",
    "experiments performed have shown that ceramics afe@xmath0b@xmath93o@xmath1   ( a- ba , sr , ca ; b - nb , ta , sb ) have similar main features in the temperature dependence of dielectric permittivity : @xmath2   has a large step in the interval between @xmath94   and @xmath95 , the magnitude of @xmath2   is low below the step ( less then 10@xmath96   and large above the step ( of the order of 10@xmath97- 10@xmath98 ; the large value of @xmath2   remains above the step in the whole temperature interval studied ; @xmath34   has a maximum or also a step with a small maximum ; @xmath2   and @xmath34   depend on frequency : the respective step and maximum are shifted to higher temperatures at larger frequencies , while the magnitude of the permittivity at the maximal value of the step does not change much .",
    "all these features were found to be influenced by the conductivity of the samples : in the samples with higher conductivity the step lays at lower temperatures and the maximal value of @xmath2   is higher .",
    "we propose that the phenomenon of the high values of the dielectric permittivity in ceramics afe@xmath0b@xmath0o@xmath99   ( a - ba , sr , ca ; b - nb , ta , sb ) in a wide temperature interval is due to the maxwell - wagner relaxation .",
    "we fitted an expression of this model to the experimental data and found reasonable agreement between the theory and experiment .",
    "it seems that a @xmath30   step - like anomaly reported for srfe@xmath93sb@xmath0o@xmath1   at @xmath100   and attributed to the presence of an antiferroelectric phase transition @xcite is due to the maxwell - wagner relaxation .",
    "the same seems to be the case for srtio@xmath3:bi @xcite as well as for cacu@xmath3ti@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite .",
