    "<S> the two  dimensional ising model with fixed magnetization is studied using monte carlo techniques . at the coexistence line , </S>",
    "<S> the macroscopic , extensive droplet of minority spins becomes thermally unstable by breaking up into microscopic clusters . </S>",
    "<S> intriguing finite  size effects as well as singularities of thermal and cluster properties associated with the transition are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> [ droplets in ising model ]    the two  dimensional ising model has attracted much interest in the past . </S>",
    "<S> it is conceptually simple , and several of its non  trivial properties can be determined exactly @xcite . however , despite numerous studies , the model seems to be not yet completely understood .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we shall deal with the thermal stability of a droplet of minority spins in the two  dimensional ising model with _ fixed magnetization _ </S>",
    "<S> , monitoring the transition from a compact single , macroscopic and extensive droplet at low temperatures to an ensemble of small clusters at high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> although related cluster equilibrium properties have been studied rather carefully in the usual , _ grand  canonical _ ising model @xcite , this topic seems to have been largely overlooked . only recently </S>",
    "<S> , the corresponding thermal behaviour of an adatom or vacancy island of monoatomic height on a crystal surface has been investigated @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider a square lattice with @xmath0 sites and full periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> neighbouring spins , @xmath1 , may interact ferromagnetically , with the coupling term @xmath2 , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath4 , out of totally @xmath0 , spins are @xmath5 spins , with the magnetization @xmath6 being conserved when varying the temperature , @xmath7 .    the resulting phase diagram in the @xmath8plane </S>",
    "<S> is known to display a transition of first order between droplet and stripe phases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transition takes place in the coexistence region , which is bounded by @xmath9 describing the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization of the standard ising model . in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath10 is determined by @xcite @xmath11^{1/8}.\\ ] ] another intriguing feature of the droplet phase in the coexistence region , @xmath12 , will be discussed in the following , the thermal stability of the droplet of minority spins , i.e. @xmath5 spins for @xmath13 .    at @xmath14 , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 minority spins form a single square droplet in the ground state . when increasing the temperature at fixed magnetization , the largest cluster will , of course , shrink , but it may be , at sufficiently low temperatures , still extensive , with the number of cluster spins , thermally averaged , @xmath15 , being proportional to @xmath0 ( @xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the droplet size @xmath17 defined by @xmath18 will be non  zero in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath19 , with @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) being constant .    </S>",
    "<S> however , at and above the coexistence line , @xmath22 , the largest cluster is expected to be non  </S>",
    "<S> extensive @xcite , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . thence , one expects a cluster transition , @xmath23 at or below @xmath24 . indeed , assuming that , in the coexistence region , see ref . </S>",
    "<S> 8 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the magnetization in the droplet , @xmath27 is the magnetization in the rest of the system , and @xmath10 is given by equation ( 2 ) , one may easily obtain @xmath28 , at fixed magnetization @xmath20 , as @xmath29 obviously , the droplet size will then vanish linearly in the reduced temperature @xmath30 as @xmath31 @xcite .    to investigate the cluster transition and to check this relation </S>",
    "<S> , we did monte carlo simulations using a nonlocal spin - exchange algorithm @xcite as well as an efficient cluster algorithm @xcite , studying square lattices of various sizes , @xmath0 , with @xmath32 ranging from 25 to 950 , at various magnetizations @xmath20 , ranging from 0.68 to 0.98 .    as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , the droplet size @xmath33 seems to approach equation ( 5 ) , as one considers larger and larger lattices , being presumably valid in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour holds at all values of @xmath20 , we studied . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one observes rather interesting finite  size effects .    </S>",
    "<S> first , the cluster transition is signalled , in a finite system , by the turning point of @xmath28 , at @xmath34 . for moderate system sizes , with @xmath32 up to , say , 750 , @xmath34 is found to vary ( almost ) linearly in @xmath35 , for different values of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward linear extrapolation would yield cluster transition temperatures close to , but somewhat below @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , one may expect subtle finite  size corrections to the observed linear behaviour. in this context , attention is drawn to the non  monotonic size dependence of @xmath28 close to the coexistence temperature @xmath24 , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . obviously </S>",
    "<S> , rather large systems need to be considered in the vicinity of @xmath24 to allow a reliable extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting finite  size effect is found by studying the size dependence of the largest cluster @xmath15 close to @xmath24 . for small lattices , </S>",
    "<S> the droplet size scales like @xmath36 , with the ( effective @xcite ) exponent @xmath37 , at fixed temperature , being quite small , e.g. at @xmath38 @xmath37 is seen to be around 0.5 to 0.7 . only for larger lattices , the cluster seems to become more compact , with @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover , at @xmath40 , is characterised by a pronounced peak in the effective exponent @xmath37 , with the peak height and crossover length @xmath40 increasing as @xmath7 approaches @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this phenomenon is not predicted by equation ( 5 ) which assumes a compact , extensive droplet , as seems to be correct in the thermodynamic limit .    </S>",
    "<S> previous evidence for the cluster transition is rather scarce . in the context of an adatom island on a crystal surface , </S>",
    "<S> the related transition was noticed @xcite , but it was not discussed in the framework of the phase diagram of the corresponding ising model . in that study , a non  trivial critical exponent describing the vanishing of the droplet size @xmath17 on approach to the cluster transition had been obtained , estimating the transition temperature from a straightforward linear extrapolation of simulational data for moderate system sizes , as discussed above. a possible hint on the cluster transition might be hidden in a renormalization group study of saito @xcite on quenches in ising models with conserved magnetization , finding , however , a transition below the coexistence line , without mentioning of the thermal stability of the droplet. attention is also drawn to the work of kertsz on droplet stability in ising models in an external field @xcite as well as related recent work on ising cubes @xcite and cluster shapes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it looks quite promising to analyse various cluster properties close to the cluster transition , in analogy to percolation studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we find that the second moment of the cluster size distribution , excluding the largest cluster , shows a pronounced peak close to @xmath41 , indicating a divergence at the cluster transition in the thermodynamic limit . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the specific heat also displays a pronounced maximum close to @xmath41 .    in summary , we conclude that there seems to be , in the two  dimensional ising model with conserved magnetization , a cluster transition at the coexistence line , at which the droplet of minority spins looses , in the thermodynamic limit , its extensivity . </S>",
    "<S> we think that the interesting cluster and thermal properties as well as finite  size effects close to that transition deserve to be studied in more detail in the future , both in two and three dimensions .    </S>",
