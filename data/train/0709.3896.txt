    "a _ self - similar process _ is a stochastic process such that any part of its trajectory is invariant under time scaling .",
    "self - similar processes are of considerable interest in practice in modeling various phenomena , including internet traffic ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , hydrology ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or economics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in various applications , empirical data also shows strong correlation of observations , indicating the presence , in addition to self - similarity , of long - range dependence .",
    "we refer to the monographs @xcite and @xcite for various properties of , and fields of application for , such processes .",
    "the motivation for this work is to examine non - gaussian self - similar processes using tools from stochastic analysis .",
    "we will focus our attention on a special process of this type , the so - called _",
    "rosenblatt process_. this belongs to a class of self - similar processes which also exhibit long - range dependence and which appear as limits in the so - called noncentral limit theorem : the class of _ hermite _ processes .",
    "we study the behavior of the quadratic variations for the rosenblatt process @xmath4 , which is related to recent results by @xcite , and we apply the results to the study of estimators for the self - similarity parameter of @xmath4 .",
    "recently , results on variations or weighted quadratic variations of fractional brownian motion were obtained in @xcite , among others .",
    "the hermite processes were introduced by taqqu ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and by dobrushin and major ( see @xcite ) .",

    "it stochastic integral with respect to a two - sided brownian motion @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we note that the hermite processes of order @xmath14 , which are non - gaussian , have only been defined for @xmath15 ; how to define these processes for @xmath16 is still an open problem .",
    "the case @xmath17 is the well - known fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) : this is gaussian .",
    "one recognizes that when @xmath17 , ( [ hermite ] ) is the moving average representation of fractional brownian motion .",
    "the rosenblatt process is the case @xmath18 .",
    "all hermite processes share the following basic properties :    * they exhibit long - range dependence ( the long - range covariance decays at the rate of the nonsummable power function @xmath19 ) ; * they are @xmath0-self - similar , in the sense that for any @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are equal in distribution ; * they have stationary increments , that is , the distribution of @xmath23 does not depend on @xmath24 ; * they share the same covariance function,@xmath25 = : r^{h}(t , s)=\\tfrac{1}% { 2 } ( t^{2h}+s^{2h}-|t - s|^{2h } ) , \\qquad s , t\\geq0,\\ ] ] so , for every @xmath26 , the expected squared increment of the hermite process is@xmath27",

    "the stochastic analysis of fbm has been developed intensively in recent years and its applications are numerous .",
    "other hermite processes are less well studied , but are still of interest due to their long - range dependence , self - similarity and stationarity of increments .",
    "the great popularity of fbm in modeling is due to these properties and fbm is preferred over higher order hermite processes because it is a gaussian process and because its calculus is much easier .",
    "however , in concrete situations , when empirical data attests to the presence of self - similarity and long memory without the gaussian property , one can use a hermite process living in a higher chaos .",
    "the hurst parameter @xmath0 characterizes all of the important properties of a hermite process , as seen above . therefore , properly estimating @xmath0 is of the utmost importance .",
    "several statistics have been introduced to this end , such as wavelets , @xmath34-variations , variograms , maximum likelihood estimators and spectral methods .",
    "information on these various approaches can be found in the book by beran @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will use variation statistics to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "let us recall the context .",
    "suppose that a process @xmath35}$ ] is observed at discrete times @xmath36 and let @xmath37 be a `` filter '' of length @xmath38 and @xmath39 a fixed power ; that is , @xmath37 is an @xmath40-dimensional vector @xmath41 such that @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath34-variation statistic associated to the filter @xmath37 is then defined as @xmath45,\\ ] ] where , for @xmath46,@xmath47 when @xmath48 is fbm , these statistics are used to derive strongly consistent estimators for the hurst parameter and their associated normal convergence results .",
    "a detailed study can be found in @xcite and @xcite or , more recently , in @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath49 is used to derive similar behaviors for the corresponding estimators .",
    "the basic result for fbm is that , if @xmath50 , then the renormalized @xmath34-variation @xmath49 converges to a standard normal distribution .",
    "the easiest and most natural case is that of the filter @xmath51 , in which case @xmath52 ; one then has the restriction @xmath53 . the techniques used to prove such convergence in the fbm case in the above references are strongly related to the gaussian property of the observations ; they appear not to extend to non - gaussian situations .",
    "our purpose here is to develop new techniques that can be applied to both the fbm case and to other non - gaussian self - similar processes .",
    "since this is the first attempt in such a direction , we keep things as simple as possible : we treat the case of the filter @xmath51 with a @xmath34-variation order @xmath54 ( quadratic variation ) , but the method can be generalized . as announced above",
    ", we further specialize to the simplest non - gaussian hermite process , that is , the one of order @xmath55 , the rosenblatt process .",
    "we now give a short overview of our results ( a more detailed summary of these facts is given in the next subsection ) .",
    "we obtain that , after suitable normalization , the quadratic variation statistic of the rosenblatt process converges to a rosenblatt random variable with the same self - similarity order ; in fact , this random variable is the observed value of the original rosenblatt process at time @xmath2 and the convergence occurs in the mean square .",
    "more precisely , the quadratic variation statistic can be decomposed into the sum of two terms : a term in the fourth wiener chaos ( i.e. , an iterated integral of order 4 with respect to the wiener process ) and a term in the second wiener chaos .",
    "the fourth wiener chaos term is well behaved , in the sense that it has a gaussian limit in distribution , but the second wiener chaos term is ill behaved , in the sense that its asymptotics are non - gaussian and are , in fact , rosenblatt - distributed .",
    "this term , being of a higher order than the well - behaved one , is responsible for the asymptotics of the entire statistic .",
    "but , since its convergence occurs in the mean - square and the limit is observed , we can construct an adjusted variation by subtracting the contribution of the ill - behaved term .",
    "we find an estimator for the self - similarity parameter of the rosenblatt process , based on observed data , whose asymptotic distribution is normal .",
    "our main tools are the malliavin calculus , the wiener ",
    "it chaos expansions and recent results on the convergence of multiple stochastic integrals proved in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the key point is the following : if the observed process @xmath48 lives in some wiener chaos of finite order , then the statistic @xmath56 can be decomposed , using product formulas and wiener chaos calculus , into a finite sum of multiple integrals .",
    "one can then attempt to apply the criteria in @xcite to study the convergence in law of such sequences and to derive asymptotic normality results ( or to demonstrate the lack thereof ) on the estimators for the hurst parameter of the observed process .",
    "the criteria in @xcite are necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence to the gaussian law ; in some instances , these criteria fail ( e.g. , the fbm case with @xmath57 ) , in which case , a proof of nonnormal convergence `` by hand , '' working directly with the chaoses , can be employed .",
    "it is the basic wiener chaos calculus that makes this possible .",
    "we now summarize the main results of this paper in some detail .",
    "as stated above , we use quadratic variation with @xmath51 .",
    "we consider the two following processes , observed at the discrete times @xmath58 : the fbm process @xmath59 and the rosenblatt process @xmath60 . in either case , the standardized quadratic variation and the hurst parameter estimator are given , respectively , by@xmath61 we choose to use the normalization @xmath62 in the definition of @xmath56 ( as , e.g. , in @xcite ) , although , in the literature , it sometimes does not appear .",
    "the @xmath0-dependent constants @xmath63 ( et al . ) referred to below are defined explicitly in ( [ dh ] ) , ( [ ah ] ) , ( [ c3h ] ) , ( [ c1h ] ) , ( [ e1h ] ) and ( [ f1h ] ) . here , and throughout , @xmath64 denotes the set of square - integrable random variables measurable with respect to the sigma field generated by @xmath33 .",
    "this sigma - field is the same as that generated by @xmath65 or by @xmath4 .",
    "the term `` rosenblatt random variable '' denotes a random variable whose distribution is the same as that of @xmath66 .",
    "we first recall the followings facts , relative to fractional brownian motion :    1 .",
    "if @xmath59 and @xmath67 , then : a.   @xmath68 converges in distribution to the standard normal law ; b.   @xmath69 converges in distribution to the standard normal law ; 2 .",

    "if @xmath59 and @xmath75 , then : a.   @xmath76 converges in distribution to the standard normal law ; b.   @xmath77 converges in distribution to the standard normal law . +",
    "the convergences for the standardized @xmath56 s in points 1(a ) and 2(a ) have been known for some time , in works such as @xcite and @xcite . lately , even stronger results , which also give error bounds , have been proven .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the one - dimensional case and @xmath78 , @xcite for then one - dimensional case and @xmath79 and to @xcite for the multidimensional case and @xmath78 .",
    "+ in this paper , we prove the following results for the rosenblatt process @xmath60 as @xmath80 : 4 .",
    "if @xmath60 and @xmath81 , then with @xmath82 in ( [ c3h ] ) , a.   @xmath83 converges in @xmath64 to the rosenblatt random variable @xmath66 ; b.   @xmath84 converges in @xmath31 to the same rosenblatt random variable @xmath66 ; 5 .",

    "note that @xmath66 is the _ actual observed value _ of the rosenblatt process at time @xmath2 , which is why it is legitimate to include it in a formula for an estimator .",
    "points  4 and  5 are new results .",
    "the subject of variations and statistics for the rosenblatt process has thus far received too narrow a treatment in the literature , presumably because standard techniques inherited from the noncentral limit theorem ( and sometimes based on the fourier transform formula for the driving gaussian process ) are difficult to apply ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our wiener chaos calculus approach allows us to show that the standardized quadratic variation and corresponding estimator both converge to a rosenblatt random variable in @xmath64 . here",
    ", our method has a crucial advantage : we are able to determine which rosenblatt random variable it converges to : it is none other than the observed value @xmath66 . the fact that we are able to prove @xmath31 convergence , not just convergence in distribution , is crucial . indeed , when @xmath90 , subtracting an appropriately normalized version of this observed value from the quadratic variation and its associated estimator , we prove that asymptotic normality does hold in this case .",
    "this unexpected result has important consequences for the statistics of the rosenblatt process since it permits the use of standard techniques in parameter estimation and testing.=-1    our asymptotic normality result for the rosenblatt process was specifically made possible by showing that @xmath56 can be decomposed into two terms : a term @xmath91 in the fourth wiener chaos and a term @xmath92 in the second wiener chaos . while the second - wiener - chaos term @xmath92 always converges to the rosenblatt random variable @xmath66 , the fourth chaos term @xmath91 converges to a gaussian random variable for @xmath93 .",
    "we conjecture that this asymptotic normality should also occur for hermite processes of higher order @xmath94 and that the threshold @xmath75 is universal .",
    "the threshold @xmath90 in the results above comes from the discrepancy that exists between a normalized @xmath92 and its observed limit @xmath66 .",
    "if we were to rephrase results  4 and 5 above , with @xmath92 instead of @xmath66 ( which is not a legitimate operation when defining an estimator since @xmath92 is not observed ) , the threshold would be @xmath93 and the constant @xmath87 would vanish .    beyond our basic interest concerning parameter estimation problems ,",
    "let us situate our paper in the context of some recent and interesting works on the asymptotic behavior of @xmath95-variations ( or weighted variations ) for gaussian processes , namely the papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these recent papers study the behavior of sequences of the type@xmath96 where @xmath48 is a gaussian process ( fractional brownian motion in @xcite and @xcite , and the solution of the heat equation driven by a space - time white noise in @xcite ) or the iterated brownian motion in @xcite and @xmath97 is a regular deterministic function . in the fractional brownian motion case ,",
    "the behavior of such sums varies according to the values of the hurst parameter , the limit sometimes being a conditionally gaussian random variable , sometimes a deterministic riemann integral and sometimes a pathwise integral with respect to a hermite process .",
    "we believe that our work is the first to tackle a non - gaussian case , that is , when the process @xmath48 above is a rosenblatt process .",
    "although we restrict ourselves to the case when @xmath98 , we still observe the appearance of interesting limits , depending on the hurst parameter : while , in general , the limit of the suitably normalized sequence is a rosenblatt random variable ( with the same hurst parameter @xmath0 as the data , which poses a slight problem for statistical applications ) , the adjusted variations ( i.e. , the sequences obtained by subtracting precisely the portion responsible for the non - gaussian convergence ) do converge to a gaussian limit for @xmath3 .",
