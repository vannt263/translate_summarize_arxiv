    "asteroids with the dwarf planet , ceres , as the largest member , have sizes ranging from a few meters to a few hundred km .",
    "they were subject to strong collisional interaction , as indicated by the formation of many asteroid families composed of breakup fragments from disruptive impact events .",
    "a fundamental discovery made by @xcite concerning the internal structures of asteroids has to do with the statistical result that objects with sizes larger than 150 m have rotation periods longer than 2.2 hours .",
    "this spin cutoff can be explained by the rubble - pile structure in which the asteroids are made up of collisional breakup fragments bound together by mutual gravitational force .",
    "faster rotation will lead to centrifugal disruption .",
    "only one object , 2001 oe84 , which is a near - earth asteroid with a diameter of 0.65 km @xcite and shows a rotation period of 29.19 minutes , has been found to be exception to this rule @xcite .",
    "@xcite subsequently proposed that the binding of such fast rotating asteroids could be the result of size - dependent material strength and predicted the presence of km / sub - km - sized super - fast rotators ( hereafter sfrs ) .",
    "it is noteworthy to point out that several sfr candidates of this size range were reported by @xcite and @xcite , but none of them had reliably determined periods @xcite .",
    "this is because their low brightness and fast rotation make such sfrs difficult to be detected and confirmed by follow - up observations .",
    "a comprehensive program is required to produce quantitative measurements .    within the framework of the ptf / iptf project and the tango project ,",
    "a systematic survey of asteroid lightcurves has been carried out by data mining of the archived data ( see * ? ? ? * for the pilot study ) and dedicated observational campaigns ( see * ? ? ? * for the result for the first campaign ) using the 48-inch oschin schmidt telescope ( p48 ) . in our second",
    "( january 69 , 2014 ) and third ( february 2023 , 2014 ) dedicated observational campaigns , a number of sfr candidates have been identified in the analysis of these data sets ( the result including asteroid rotation periods and sfr candidates will be published in the near future ) .",
    "one of them is ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 . in this work",
    ", we report on the p48 discovery observation during february 2023 , 2014 , and the follow - up observations conducted on the 200-inch hale telescope at the palomar observatory on march 25 , 2014 to confirm the identity of this interesting object . in section 2 , we describe our observations and data reduction .",
    "the rotation period analysis is given in section 3 .",
    "the results and discussion are presented in section 4 .",
    "a summary and conclusion can be found in section 5 .",
    "the ptf is a synoptic survey designed to explore the transient and variable sky @xcite .",
    "it employs the 48-inch oschin schmidt telescope equipped with an 11-chip mosaic ccd camera that has a field of view of @xmath6 deg@xmath7 and a pixel scale of 1.01 .",
    "the available filters include mould-_r _ , gunn-_g _ and @xmath8 , and its @xmath9 median limiting magnitude of an exposure of 60 s in @xmath10-band is @xmath1121 mag @xcite .",
    "each ptf exposure was processed by the ipac - ptf photometric pipeline including image splitting , de - biasing , flat - fielding , source extraction , astrometric calibration , and photometric calibration @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "its final products include reduced images , mask images and source catalogs .",
    "the ptf absolute photometric calibration was done by fitting to catalog data in sloan digital sky survey fields ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; hereafter , sdss ) , which routinely reached a precision of @xmath12 mag @xcite .",
    "since the calibration was done on a per - night , per - field , per - filter , per - chip basis , small photometric zero - point variations are possible from night to night , the accuracy of which depends on the degree to which a night is affected by mist and cloud cover , and transient variations in atmospheric conditions .    as part of the tango project",
    ", we conducted an asteroid rotation - period survey during february 2023 , 2014 , which continuously scanned twelve consecutive ptf fields on the ecliptic plane in @xmath10-band with a cadence of @xmath13 min and an exposure time of 60 s for each frame .",
    "the total sky area was @xmath14 deg@xmath7 .",
    "table  [ obs_log_ptf ] lists the observational metadata and fig .",
    "[ obs_fig ] shows the field configuration . to extract known asteroid lightcurves ,",
    "the source catalogs were purged of all stationary sources and then matched against the ephemerides obtained from the _ jpl / horizons _ system with a radius of 2 . in this campaign , we extracted @xmath112500 lightcurves suitable for rotation period analysis .",
    "the preliminary result showed @xmath11910 objects had good rotation period determinations , and 11 of them were identified as sfr candidates .",
    "the result will be published in a separate paper soon .",
    "the follow - up observations for the sfr candidates were also planned .",
    "our main - belt asteroid of interest , ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 , was close to its opposition and located on the chips 7,6,6 of field 3161 on 20,21,and 22 feb 2014 , and on chip 11 of field 3160 on 23 feb 2014 .",
    "therefore , we were able to obtain its lightcurve over a four - night time span to identify it as a highly probable sfr and conducted a follow - up observation to confirm its short rotation period .",
    "the follow - up observation was carried out in the night of march 25 , 2014 by using the 200-inch hale telescope at palomar ( hereafter p200 ) , equipped for imaging with the large format camera ( lfc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which has a pixel size of 0.363 .",
    "in order to obtain the lightcurve and color of ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 , we followed an observational filter sequence of 2 @xmath15- , 2 @xmath16- , 2 @xmath17- , 18 @xmath16- , 2 @xmath15- , 2 @xmath16- , 2 @xmath17- and 15 @xmath16-bands .",
    "the time difference between two exposures was @xmath18 min , including a 2-min exposure time and an @xmath111-min readout time .",
    "therefore , we obtained 47 exposures in total ( i.e. , 4 @xmath15 , 4 @xmath17 and 39 @xmath16 bands ) over a time span of @xmath19 min .",
    "we applied standard de - biasing , flat - fielding and astrometric calibration to all images and used sextractor @xcite to extract sources .",
    "the absolute photometry of each exposure was calibrated against sdss point sources of @xmath20 to 22 mag by using linear - least - square fitting and typically obtained a fitting residual of @xmath12 mag . since ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 would have a trail length of @xmath21 for a 2-min exposure , similar to the seeing size ( i.e. , @xmath21 ) and much larger than the pixel size ( i.e. , 0.363 ) , we employed the trail - fitting method @xcite to improve its photometric accuracy . the first one and last",
    "two exposures were not included in the following analysis due to their fuzzy images .",
    "to measure the synodic rotation period of ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 , all data points were corrected for light - travel time ( i.e. , the time interval of a photon traveling from object to earth ) and the magnitudes were reduced to both heliocentric ( @xmath22 ) and geocentric @xmath23 distances at 1 au by @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are reduced and apparent magnitudes , respectively .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath23 were calculated by the pyephem using the orbital elements obtained from the minor planet center .",
    "we applied a second - order fourier series , which was developed by @xcite and has since become the standard for asteroid lightcurve fitting ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to the ptf @xmath10-band lightcurve and the p200 @xmath16-band lightcurve separately , in order to search for their rotation periods : @xmath27 + c_k\\cos\\left[\\frac{2\\pi k}{p } ( t_j - t_0)\\right ] + z_i,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the reduced magnitude measured at the light - travel time corrected epoch @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the fourier coefficients , @xmath32 is the rotation period and @xmath33 is an arbitrary epoch .",
    "following @xcite , we also fitted a constant value @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ fteq ] ) to correct the small systematic offsets between different ptf data sets , where a data set was defined as all the measurements taken on the same night , field , filter and ccd . then , eq .  ( [ fteq ] )",
    "was solved by using least - squares minimization for each given @xmath32 to obtain the other free parameters .",
    "we tried a frequency range of 0.2525 rev / day with a step of 0.0025 rev / day to cover the majority of asteroid rotation periods @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the derived rotation period was calculated from the range of periods with @xmath35 smaller than @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the @xmath35 of the picked - out period and @xmath38 is calculated from the inverse @xmath35 distribution , assuming @xmath39 degrees of freedom .",
    "the rotation periods of ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 derived from the ptf and the p200 observations are very compatible with each other , which are @xmath40 and @xmath41 hours , respectively .",
    "the super - fast rotating nature of this asteroid is very convincingly demonstrated in both folded lightcurves ( see fig .  [ lc ] ) .",
    "the peak - to - peak variation of the ptf lightcurve is @xmath42 mag and that of the p200 lightcurve is @xmath0 mag .",
    "although the p200 folded lightcurve does not cover two full cycles of the derived period , we do not see any particular offset in the overlap between the first ( red filled circles ) and second ( black filled circles ) cycles .",
    "moreover , the lightcurve shows a large amplitude .",
    "therefore , it is very unlikely that ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 would be the case as discussed in @xcite , where the authors pointed out that some asteroids might have ambiguous rotation period determinations due to their small lightcurve amplitudes ( i.e. , the half rotation period was misidentified as a `` real '' rotation period ) .",
    "one special case reported by @xcite that ( 40701 ) 1999 rg235 showed a possible three - peaked lightcurve with a large amplitude .",
    "this could be a possibility for ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 .",
    "if the lightcurve of our target has a four - peaks , then it must have identical odd maxima , even maxima and even minima as seen in our case .",
    "such a chance seems to be vary small , and we thus believe our derived rotation period is highly probable to be the true rotation period of ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 .    in order to improve the p200 lightcurve fitting , we used a sixth - order fourier series to analysis its rotation period again . the result is shown in fig .  [ lc ] as well .",
    "we see the best - fit rotation period still remains at 1.29 hours and the fine features on the p200 folded lightcurve are reproduced relatively well as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "this means ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 has a more complex shape .    since the @xmath15 and @xmath17 data points show similar variation to the p200 @xmath16-band lightcurve , we use eq .",
    "( [ fteq ] ) with the derived rotation period , 1.290 hours , to obtain the offsets , @xmath34 , between the measurements for the @xmath15- , @xmath16- and @xmath17-bands , where a data set was then defined as the measurements taken with the same filter .",
    "the best - fitting results were @xmath43 mag and @xmath44 mag , which indicates a s- or v - type asteroid for ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 @xcite .",
    "incorporating @xmath4 obtained from the sdss moving object catalog @xcite , we believe ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 is most likely a v - type asteroid @xcite .",
    "since the ptf and p200 lightcurves were observed in different bands and the phase angles ( @xmath45 ) had a small change in both observations , we only applied , instead of fitting , the @xmath46@xmath47 system ( eq .",
    "( [ hmag ] ) * ? ? ? * ) with a fixed @xmath47 slope of @xmath48 ( i.e. , a typical @xmath47 value for v - type asteroid ; * ? ? ? * ) to the p200 @xmath16-band lightcurve to estimate the absolute magnitude @xmath46 of ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 .",
    "@xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50,\\ ] ] @xmath51.\\ ] ] this gives a mean value of @xmath1 mag . moreover , its diameter is estimated using @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the @xmath16-band albedo and the conversion constant , 1130 , adopted from @xcite .",
    "we assumed an albedo of @xmath54 , which was adopted from the geometric albedo in visible wavelengths ( @xmath55 ) appropriate for v - type asteroid @xcite .",
    "although there is a small difference between @xmath53 and @xmath55 , we treat this difference as a part of uncertainty in our assuming albedo . therefore , we have a derived diameter of @xmath56 km , where the diameter range is estimated by the uncertainties introduced by @xmath53 , @xmath47 and @xmath57 .    combining the data taken from @xcite and @xcite , we plot the asteroid spin rate vs. diameter in fig .  [ dia_per ] .",
    "we see both ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 and 2001 oe84 located at above the `` spin barrier '' of the `` rubble - pile '' asteroids and away from the small monolithic sfrs .",
    "this result indicates ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 is a sfr . to keep ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 from breaking apart under such fast rotation by its own gravity only",
    ", it requires a bulk density as high as @xmath58 g/@xmath59 when assuming a critical rotation period as @xmath60hours for an object with a lightcurve variation of @xmath0 mag @xcite .",
    "such high bulk density is very unusual for the `` rubble - pile '' asteroids .",
    "this is because , as shown in the plot of spin rate vs. lightcurve amplitude in fig .",
    "[ spin_amp ] , the `` rubble - pile '' asteroids can not have a bulk density @xmath61 g/@xmath59 @xcite .",
    "to explain the presence of km / sub - km - sized sfrs , @xcite used a size - dependent strength for asteroids , which included tensile strength and cohesiveness , in addition to gravity .",
    "this additional size - dependent effect could produce a transition from the small monolithic object region to the large gravitationally bounded aggregation region .",
    "therefore , a comprehensive survey of the population of km / sub - km - sized sfrs would help us understand this question .",
    "sub - km - sized sfr , ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 , which is a main - belt asteroid showing a rotation period of 1.290 hours ( i.e. , a frequency of 18.6 rev / day ) , was discovered in the asteroid rotation period survey conducted on the ptf during feb 2023 , 2014 as part of the tango project .",
    "it was confirmed by the follow - up observation carried out on march 25 , 2014 using the p200 .",
    "its multi - band colors ( i.e. , @xmath43 mag , @xmath44 mag and the sdss @xmath4 ) indicate that ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 is a v - type asteroid . with an assumed albedo of @xmath62 ,",
    "the sfr asteroid s @xmath1 mag allows us to infer a diameter of @xmath56 km .",
    "this shows if ( 335433 ) 2005 uw163 is a `` rubble pile '' asteroid , it would require a bulk density as high as 11 g/@xmath59 to keep itself from breaking apart under such fast rotation .",
    "therefore , other mechanisms , such as a combination of tensile strength and cohesiveness , should be taken into account @xcite . to search for a larger sample of km / sub - km - sized sfrs by comprehensive asteroid rotation surveys , as is being planned would be very helpful to the investigation of the origin and internal structures of asteroids .",
