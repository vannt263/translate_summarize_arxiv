    "it is commonly believed that the hubbard model and its extentions can widely be used to explain many of physical phenomena observed in quite different areas of the solid state physics : magnetic and transport properties of transitions matals , their compounds and alloys , including insulator - metal transitions ( cf e.g. refs [ 1]-[13 ] and papers cited therein ) , superconductors ( magnetic superconductors ( see e.g. refs [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] ) , high-@xmath7 superconductors ( negative @xmath5 models , cf .",
    "[ 16 ] ; @xmath4 based models ( cf refs [ 17]-[26 ] ) ) , fluctuating valence systems and heavy fermions ( anderson - like models , ref .",
    "[ 27 ] , cf also e.g. refs [ 11 ] , [ 28 ] ) , liquid @xmath8 ( cf e.g. refs [ 29]-[31 ] ) , fullerens ( cf e.g. refs [ 32]-[34 ] ) , etc .. to demostrate a high degree of complexity of the extended hubbard model we consider one - band electronic system described by the hamiltonian @xmath9 the indices ( @xmath10 ) enumerate the lattice points @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the hopping integral , @xmath5 ( positive or negative ) denotes the effective intrasite coloumb interaction , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( generally , not necessary equal ) decribe the effective intersite interactions , resulting from the original coloumb repulsion modified by the polaronic effects ( see e.g. ref . [",
    "16 ] for details ) .",
    "the operators @xmath15 are the electronic annihilation ( creation ) operators in the lattice site @xmath16 with spin index @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the model ( 1 ) can not be solved exactly in a general case .",
    "there is , however , a special but nontrivial case of two interacting ions ( a dimer problem ) which possesses exact , analytical solution .",
    "the hamiltonian of the dimer has the form ( see ( 1 ) )    @xmath19    where @xmath20 .",
    "we can exactly show that @xmath21 incorporates many competitive interactions , deeply hidden in its orginal form . to bring them all into light",
    "we will follow the method , applied earlier to the hubbard dimer alone ( see ref . [ 35 ] ) .",
    "the application of this method to the extended hubbard model for a dimer seems to be very important because it gives a review of all intrinsic interactions , possible to appear in this more general case . according to the ref .",
    "[ 35 ] we first find the exact solution of the dimer problem ( see sect .",
    "this solution consists of 16 energy levels @xmath0 and corresponding eigenvectors @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) . in the next step we use the equivalent expression for the dimer hamiltonian @xmath24 where @xmath25 . for each @xmath26",
    "the oprator @xmath27 can be represented in the second quantization where we introduce hubbard and spin operators .",
    "when using the relation ( 3 ) we can decompose the dimer hamiltonian ( 2 ) into 10 parts collecting the terms belonging to the same energy level . such decomposition",
    "according to the exact dimer energy levels possesses two main adventages .",
    "first , we bring into light all competitive interactions , possible to appear within the exactly solvable dimer .",
    "we find ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions , cooper pair hopping terms ( similar as in kulik - pedan , penson - kolb models ( cf .",
    "refs [ 36],[37 ] ) ) with positive and negative coupling constants , as well as , intersite cooper pair interactions ( see e.g. ref [ 16 ] ) . in this way",
    "we exactly show that the extended hubbard model for a dimer is , in fact , a mixture of different intrinsic interactions leading to magnetic and superconducting properties of the model which compete together .",
    "second , the presence of each intrinsic interaction is stricly ascribed to a given energy level which can be occupied or empty ( it depends on the model parameters and assumed average occupation number of electrons @xmath28 $ ] ) . in other words",
    ", we can foresee which intrinsic interaction can be  thermodynamically  active or not ( it depends on the position of the chemical potential @xmath29 with respect to a given energy level ) .",
    "coupling constants connected with each type of intrinsic interaction are calculated exactly and several of them we plot as a functions of the intrasite coulomb interaction @xmath5 to visualize the competition between them .",
    "the method applied in this paper is exact in comparison with approximative approaches ( perturbation expansion or canonical transformations ) used in the literature till now ( see refs [ 38]-[53 ] and [ 11 ] and [ 12 ] for a review ) .",
    "the knowledge about possible intrinsic interactions within the extended hubbard model seems to be very important because this model is widely used in different areas of the solid state physics .",
    "the presence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions competing with different types of interactions leading to superconductivity unambigously suggests the use of the model to magnetic superconductors ( cf e.g. refs [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] and papers cited therein ) .",
    "there is , however , one important and unsolved problem which arises from our exact calculations for a dimer .",
    "when apply the model to a real lattice ( real materials ) we are always forced to make aproximations which can destroy a delicate harmony of the model leading to the overestimation or underestimation of some important competitive interactions .",
    "thus , the problem is how to formulate a resonable approximation which treats all of them on equal footing .",
    "besides , a high degree of complexity of the extended hubbard model , explicitly shown here for a dimer , can also be a reason why the understanding of pairing in the high-@xmath6 superconductors is such a difficult problem till now .",
    "it seems to be evident that the @xmath4 model alone ( also present in our approach ) , introduced in refs [ 17]-[26 ] ( see also ref . [ 53 ] for a review ) , does not contain enough ingredients to describe high-@xmath6 superconductors because we additionally have a competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism accompanied by a challenge between the hopping of the cooper pairs between different lattice sites ( similar as in refs [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] ) and intersite cooper pair interactions .",
    "the eigenvalue problem for the dimer hamiltonian ( 2 ) can be solved exactly when start from the vectors @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 ; @xmath33 forming the fock basis ( cf . also refs [ 35 , [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] ) @xmath34 the basis vectors ( 4 ) have the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the second index @xmath37 ( if necessary ) enumerates the vectors belonging to the subspace of a given @xmath38 .",
    "the exact solution of the dimer eigenvalue problem @xmath39 can be obtained with the use of a standard procedure .",
    "we obtain    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44 where    @xmath45",
    "@xmath46    @xmath47    lets us introduce the hubbard operators    @xmath48    @xmath49    and spin operators @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 .    to obtain all intrinsic interactions ,",
    "deeply hidden in the original form of the extended hubbard model for a dimer ( 2 ) we apply the equivalent form the dimer hamiltonian ( 3 ) . each product @xmath56 in the formula ( 3 ) where we insert @xmath0 and @xmath22 from the formulae ( 5 ) can be represented as a linear combination of the basis vectors ( 4 ) which , in turn , with the use of the hubbard and spin operators ( 9)-(13 ) can be rewritten in the second quantization ( see refs . [ 35 ] , [ 54 ] , [ 55 ] ) .",
    "we collect all the terms together which correspond to the same energy level ( we take into account the degeneration of the levels as e.g. @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) . in this way we can split the hamiltonian ( 2 ) written in the form of the formula ( 3 ) into 10 terms , corresponding to 10 different dimer energy levels ( see ( 5 ) ) .",

    "the decomposition of the dimer hamiltonian ( 14 ) according to the dimer energy levels where each part is given by the expressions ( 15)-(24 ) has , however , very important advantages .",
    "first of all it vizualizes in an explicit and exact way all possible intrinsic interactions with corresponding coupling constants .",
    "second , due to the decomposition according to the dimer energy levels we can easily see which interaction can be active or passive .",
    "it is simply connected with the occupation of a given level .",
    "if a dimer level is occupied by the electrons the intrinsic interaction ascribed to this level will be active , otherwise passive ( it can be neglected ) .",
    "the occupation , in turn , depends on the model parameters , temperature and the assumed average number of electrons @xmath80 which determines the position of the chemical potential and decides which energy levels will be occupied or empty .",
    "the most important intrinsic interactions ( leading to magnetism or superconductivity ) , presented in the expressions ( 15)-(24 ) can be devided into two classes .",
    "first of them belongs to magnetic interactions ( ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic - it depends on the sign of the parametrs @xmath81 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "such interactions are present in the formulae ( 17 ) and ( 21 ) and describe ising type interactions with coupling constants generated by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the formuale ( 17 ) contains also the transverse interaction between spins ( see also later ) .",
    "the heisenberg type magnetic interactions can be seen in the first terms of the formulae ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) , generated by a more complex coupling constants , expressed by the model parameters @xmath14 , @xmath5 and @xmath82 .",
    "it is interesting to note that when @xmath83 the first term in the formulae ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) describes ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interactions ( it depends on the sign of @xmath84 ) , similar to well - known @xmath4 model because the coefficient @xmath85 for large @xmath86 ( see the formula ( 6 ) when @xmath87 ) .",
    "the first terms in the expressions ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) can also be considered as generalized @xmath4 interactions , valid in a more general case of the extended hubbard model .",
    "the coefficients @xmath88 $ ] ( the coupling constant at the first term in ( 19 ) ) and @xmath89 $ ] ( the coupling constant at the first term in ( 20 ) ) are depicted in fig.1 and fig.2 , respectively , as functions of the intrasite coulomb interaction @xmath5 for serveral values of the parameter @xmath90 .",
    "we see that @xmath91 is negative and @xmath92 is positive .",
    "thus , the first terms in ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) describe competitive ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic heisenberg interactions .",
    "let us note that the terms like @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) describe the hopping of the cooper pairs ( see the formulae ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) ) .",
    "such a competitive hopping is present in the second terms in ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) .",
    "the plots of the corresponding coupling constants @xmath95 $ ] ( the second term in the formulae ( 19 ) ) and @xmath96 $ ] ( the second term in the formulae ( 20 ) ) are depicted in fig.3 and fig.4 , respectively .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath97 is positive and @xmath98 negative .",
    "thus , the second terms in the formulae ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) describe the hopping of the cooper pairs with positive and negative coupling constants .",
    "such terms are present in the kulik - pedan , penson - kolb superconductivity models ( cf .",
    "refs [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] ) .",
    "the transversal products @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) are present in the second term in the formulae ( 17 ) , as well as , in the scalar products of spin operators @xmath101 in the first terms of the formulae ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) .",
    "when use the second quantization representation we obtain @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) and we can see that such products of spin operators describe the interaction of the intersite cooper pairs because we can write @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) where @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "thus , the second term in the formulae ( 17 ) and the transversal parts in the first terms of the formulae ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) describe , in fact , the competitive intersite cooper pair interactions leading to superconductivity ( cf .",
    "e.g. ref [ 16 ] and papers cited therein ) . from the other side the application of the resonating valence bond approach ( cf .",
    "refs [ 17]-[26 ] ) allows to rewrite the terms like @xmath108 ) , present in the first terms of the expressions ( 19 ) and ( 20 ) , when introducing the following operators @xmath109 @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xmath112 .",
    "for example , in the case of half - filling ( cf . ref .",
    "[ 21 ] ) we can write @xmath113 @xmath114 .",
    "using the exact solution of the extended hubbard model for a dimer we have reviewed the main , important interactions leading to magnetic and superconducting properties of the model . in this way we have demonstrated that the relative simplicity of the extended hubbard model is only an illusion .",
    "we have shown in an exact way that the magnetic properties ( ferromagnetism , antiferromagnetism ) compete together .",
    "there is also additionally a challenge between two types of cooper pair interactions ( cooper pair hopping and intersite cooper pair interactions ) .",
    "thus , at last , magnetic and superconducting tendencies of the model compete together .",
    "the final , thermodynamical properties of the extended hubbard model are then a result of this competition .",
    "which interaction wins in such a rally it strongly depends on temperature ( there is possible a change of the leader with varying temperature ) , model parameters and on the value of the assumed average number of electrons , determining the chemical potential of the system .",
    "such indications can certainly be helpful when use the extended hubbard model for real lattices .",
    "we have also indicated that the extended single - band hubbard model is , in fact , capable to describe properties of such superconductors where the competition between magnetism and superconductivity can explain many astonishing properties of these materials ( cf e.g. refs [ 14]-[25 ] ) , including also high-@xmath6 materials and recently synthetized @xmath115 layer based systems ( cf ref . [ 26 ] and papers cited therein ) .",
    "the nonperturbative formalism presented in this paper is , in principle , applicable to more complicated clusters consisting e.g. of one central ion and @xmath116 its nearest neighbours . we , however , know ( see e.g. refs [ 56]-[59 ] and papers cited therein ) that the mathematical problems in this case exponentially increase with the size of the considered cluster .",
    "another examples of a cluster approach to hubbard - like models are given in refs [ 60]-[65 ] ."
