    "it is well - known that at sufficiently high baryon densities massless three - flavor qcd is in the so - called color  flavor locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite . in this phase the original su(3)@xmath2su(3)@xmath3su(3)@xmath4u(1)@xmath1 symmetry of qcd",
    "is spontaneously broken down to the diagonal su(3)@xmath5 subgroup .",
    "correspondingly , seventeen massless excitations must appear in the mass spectrum of the theory .",
    "eight of them might be used to ensure a mass of gluons by the anderson ",
    "higgs mechanism .",
    "the properties of the remaining nine , one scalar and eight pseudoscalar nambu  goldstone ( ng ) bosons , as well as other collective modes of the cfl phase were studied already in the framework of weak - coupling qcd @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a weak - coupling qcd analysis of the color superconductivity phenomena , including the cfl one , can only be trusted at rather high baryon densities or , correspondingly , for values of the quark number chemical potential @xmath6 gev @xcite . at moderate values of @xmath7 mev , where weak - coupling qcd is not applicable",
    ", the description of color superconductivity is more adequate in the framework of effective theories for the low energy qcd region . in particular , since massless excitations might play an important role in different transport phenomena , a chiral effective meson theory for the pseudoscalar ng - bosons of the cfl phase was also constructed @xcite ( see also the recent review on this topic @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another effective quark model approach to low density qcd is based on the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) type of models . since the njl model contains the microscopic quark degrees of freedom , it is more fundamental and preferable , especially for the investigation of dynamical processes in dense baryonic matter , than chiral meson theories . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also more suitable for the description of physics at low baryon densities than weak - coupling qcd . in particular , in the three - flavor njl model the cfl effect was already considered , e.g. , in @xcite ( see also the review @xcite ) , where some aspects of the phase structure of dense quark matter were discussed , including the influence of the @xmath8-quark bare mass , color- and electric charge neutrality conditions , external magnetic field , etc .",
    "however , in spite of the fact that the lightest bosons may play an essential role e.g. in the cooling processes of neutron stars , up to now only few attention was paid to the consideration of the cfl ground state bosonic excitations , i.e. mesons and diquarks , and their dynamics in the framework of njl models ( see , however , the papers @xcite , where the properties of the massless ng boson , corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of the baryon u(1)@xmath1 symmetry in the cfl phase , were considered ) .",
    "in contrast , the properties of @xmath9-mesons and diquarks , surrounded by color superconducting quark matter , were already discussed in the framework of the two - flavor njl model @xcite .    in the present paper we are going to study meson and diquark excitations of the cfl ground state in the framework of the massless three - flavor njl model . as in @xcite ,",
    "our consideration is based on the effective action , which is a generating functional for one - particle irreducible green functions .",
    "they permit to get informations about the masses of bosonic excitations of the cfl phase . in the first step we will rederive the well  known result that in the normal phase of quark matter the ng bosons are just pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "next , it will be shown that in the cfl phase the ng bosons are scalar- and pseudoscalar diquark excitations .",
    "finally , we will demonstrate that in the cfl phase there appear massive scalar and pseudoscalar diquarks which are composed into a charged triplet and singlet as well as a neutral singlet of the su(3 ) group .",
    "let us consider the following njl model with three massless quark flavors @xmath10q+ g_1\\sum_{a=0}^8\\big [ ( \\bar    q\\tau_aq)^2+(\\bar qi\\gamma^5\\tau_a q)^2\\big ] + \\nonumber\\\\ & + & g_2\\!\\!\\!\\sum_{a=2,5,7}\\sum_{a'=2,5,7}\\big\\ { [ \\bar q^ci\\gamma^5\\tau_a\\lambda_{a'}q ] [ \\bar qi\\gamma^5\\tau_a\\lambda_{a ' } q^c ] + [ \\bar q^c\\tau_a\\lambda_{a'}q ] [ \\bar q\\tau_a\\lambda_{a ' } q^c]\\big\\}.    \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in ( [ 1 ] ) , @xmath11 is the quark number chemical potential , which is the same for all quark flavors , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are charge - conjugated spinors , and @xmath14 is the charge conjugation matrix ( the symbol @xmath15 denotes the transposition operation ) .",
    "the quark field @xmath16 is a flavor and color triplet as well as a four - component dirac spinor , where @xmath17 .",
    "( roman and greek indices refer to flavor and color indices , respectively ; spinor indices are omitted . )",
    "furthermore , we use the notations @xmath18 for gell - mann matrices in the flavor and color space , respectively ( @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is proportional to the unit matrix in the flavor space . clearly , the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) as a whole is invariant under transformations from the color group su(3)@xmath21 .",
    "in addition , it is symmetric under the chiral group su(3)@xmath2su(3)@xmath22 ( chiral transformations act on the flavor indices of quark fields only ) as well as under the baryon - number conservation group u(1)@xmath1 and the axial group u(1)@xmath23 . symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , in the present consideration we omit the  t hooft term , for simplicity . ]    the linearized version of the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) contains collective bosonic fields and looks like @xmath24q -\\frac{1}{4g_1}\\big [ \\sigma_a\\sigma_a+ \\pi_a\\pi_a\\big ] -   \\frac1{4g_2}\\big [ \\delta^{s*}_{aa'}\\delta^s_{aa'}+   \\delta^{p*}_{aa'}\\delta^p_{aa'}\\big ]   \\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\frac{\\delta^{s*}_{aa'}}{2}[\\bar q^ci\\gamma^5\\tau_a\\lambda_{a ' } q ] -\\frac{\\delta^s_{aa'}}{2}[\\bar q i\\gamma^5\\tau_a\\lambda_{a ' } q^c]-\\frac{\\delta^{p*}_{aa'}}{2}[\\bar   q^c\\tau_a\\lambda_{a ' } q ] -\\frac{\\delta^p_{aa'}}{2}[\\bar q\\tau_a\\lambda_{a ' } q^c ] , \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where here as well as in the following the summation over repeated indices @xmath25 and @xmath26 is implied .",
    "lagrangians ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) are equivalent which simply follows from the equations of motion for the bosonic fields @xmath27 one can easily see from ( [ 3 ] ) that the mesonic fields @xmath28 are real quantities , i.  e. @xmath29 ( the superscript symbol @xmath30 denotes the hermitian conjugation ) , whereas all diquark fields @xmath31 are complex ones , i.  e. @xmath32 moreover , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are scalars and pseudoscalars , correspondingly",
    ".    let us introduce the flavor group su(3)@xmath35=su(3)@xmath36 , which is the diagonal subgroup of the chiral group .",
    "then , all scalar diquarks @xmath33 form an @xmath37-multiplet of the su(3)@xmath4su(3)@xmath35 group , i. e. they are a color and flavor antitriplet . the same is true for pseudoscalar diquarks @xmath34 which are also the components of an @xmath38-multiplet of the su(3)@xmath4su(3)@xmath35 group .",
    "evidently , all diquarks @xmath31 have the same nonzero baryon charge .",
    "all the real @xmath39 and @xmath40 fields are color singlets .",
    "moreover , the set of scalar @xmath41-mesons is decomposed into a direct sum of the singlet and octet representations of the diagonal flavor group su(3)@xmath35 .",
    "the same decomposition into multiplets is true for the set of all pseudoscalar @xmath40-mesons .",
    "clearly , in this case the octet is constructed from three pions ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) , four kaons ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) and the eta - meson ( @xmath47 ) , whereas the singlet ( @xmath48 ) corresponds to the @xmath49-meson .",
    "+    the effective action @xmath113 in ( [ 12 ] ) is really a generating functional of the one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) two - point green functions of mesons and diquarks both in the normal and cfl phases , namely @xmath114 where @xmath115 .",
    "these green functions are very useful , in particular , in determining the dispersion relations and masses of particles . in the following",
    ", we shall say that in the theory there is a _ mixing _ between two different particles with corresponding fields @xmath116 and @xmath117 , if their 1pi green function @xmath118 is not equal to zero . by analyzing the structure of the effective action ( [ 12 ] ) , it is possible to show that in the njl model ( [ 1 ] ) with three massless quarks , mesons and diquarks are not mixed both in the normal ( @xmath110 ) and cfl phases ( @xmath111).-meson and the scalar diquark in the color superconducting phase of a two - flavor njl model with nonzero masses of @xmath119- and @xmath120-quarks @xcite .",
    "] moreover , each pseudoscalar @xmath40 field ( as well as scalar @xmath121 one ) does not mix with other meson fields , apart from itself .",
    "so , in the normal phase ( where @xmath67 and @xmath122 mev ) one can obtain the following expression @xmath123 for the fourier transformation of the two - point 1pi green function of pseudoscalar mesons @xmath124 , taken in the rest frame @xmath125 : @xmath126}.   \\label{18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( in obtaining ( [ 18 ] ) , the gap equation ( [ 14 ] ) was used in order to eliminate the coupling constant @xmath127 from the final expression . )",
    "evidently , this expression turns into zero at @xmath128 .",
    "since the relation ( [ 18 ] ) is true for @xmath129 , it means that nine massless excitations , nambu  goldstone ( ng ) bosons , do exist in the pseudoscalar meson sector of the model in the normal phase .",
    "this fact corresponds to a spontaneous symmetry breaking in the normal phase down to the group su(3)@xmath4su(3)@xmath130u(1)@xmath1 .",
    "recall , that our initial njl model ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant under the symmetry group su(3)@xmath2su(3)@xmath3su(3)@xmath4 u(1)@xmath131u(1)@xmath23 , which contains an additional ( nonphysical ) axial subgroup u(1)@xmath23 .",
    "so in the cfl phase , where the ground state is symmetric under the group su(3)@xmath5 , an additional ng boson must appear in the mass spectrum of the model giving altogether eighteen ng bosons .",
    "note that in the sector of the meson excitations of the cfl phase we do not find any massless particle .",
    "a further consideration of the effective action ( [ 12 ] ) shows that in the cfl phase , where @xmath132 and @xmath133 , scalar and pseudoscalar diquarks are separated from each other .",
    "moreover , the eighteen pseudoscalar diquarks ( nine @xmath34 and nine @xmath134 fields ) may be divided into four sectors : @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "each of the sectors @xmath139 , where @xmath140 , is composed of @xmath34 , @xmath134 , @xmath141 and @xmath142-diquarks , whereas the sector @xmath138 is composed of six fields , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "there is a mixing between diquarks from the same sector , however fields from different sectors are not mixed .",
    "( the analogous situation takes place for the set of scalar diquarks . )    partially , these mixing properties of the pseudoscalar diquarks are explained by the ground state su(3)@xmath5 symmetry of the cfl phase .",
    "indeed , with respect to this group all pseudoscalar diquarks are decomposed into a direct sum of the @xmath149 and @xmath150 multiplets .",
    "the fields @xmath151 with @xmath64 are in an antitriplet @xmath149 , whereas all diquarks of the form @xmath141 ( @xmath152 ) are in an antisixtet @xmath153 .",
    "it is clear from symmetry considerations that diquarks from @xmath149 do not mix with diquarks from @xmath153 ( here we use the terminology , introduced just after ( [ 17 ] ) ) .",
    "since the mixing between a particle and corresponding antiparticle is allowed as a rule , we may conclude that pseudoscalar diquarks from the sector @xmath138 are separated from the other six @xmath141- and six @xmath154-diquarks ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "a further separation between components of the @xmath153-multiplet and corresponding antiparticles occurs on a dynamical basis , i. e. it is due to the structure of the effective action ( [ 12 ] ) and the quark propagator matrix ( [ 121])-([124 ] ) . as a result",
    ", one can show that these diquarks are divided into the three above - mentioned sectors , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 .    below",
    "we suppose that the gap @xmath99 is a real positive number in the cfl phase .        to summarize , in the pseudoscalar diquark sectors @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 we have found six massless diquark excitations , which are ng bosons , as well as six pseudoscalar diquark excitations with a nonzero mass which is a solution of the equation ( [ 26 ] ) . in total , these six massive real pseudoscalar diquarks form a complex ( charged ) triplet of the su(3)@xmath5 group .",
    "eliminating in ( [ 30 ] ) the coupling constant @xmath162 again with the help of the gap equation ( [ 15 ] ) , one can easily show that @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "evidently , in this case both the square bracket expression and the brace one from ( [ 36 ] ) turn into zero at @xmath128 . hence , in the @xmath138-sector of the model there are three pseudoscalar ng boson excitations .",
    "now let us obtain some information about the remaining three excitations , which are massive ones .",
    "for this purpose , similarly to ( [ 25 ] ) , it is possible to extract in an evident form the factor @xmath165 from the expressions in the curly brackets of ( [ 36 ] ) , i. e. @xmath183 then it is clear from ( [ 36 ] ) that two of these excitations have an identical mass which is a solution of the equation @xmath184 in total , they form a complex ( charged ) singlet of the group su(3)@xmath185 .",
    "finally , there is a further diquark excitation , whose mass obeys another equation @xmath186 evidently , this diquark is also a su(3)@xmath185-singlet . as a result , we have proved that there are nine pseudoscalar ng bosons ( diquarks ) in the mass spectrum of the initial njl model .",
    "moreover , it contains massive pseudoscalar diquarks , composed of a complex triplet and singlet as well as real singlet of the group su(3)@xmath187 .    since in the chiral limit , where all quarks are massless , the two - point 1pi green functions of scalar diquarks are identical to the corresponding green functions of pseudoscalar diquark fields , one may conclude that the diquark spectrum contains nine scalar massless excitations . in real qcd , eight of them should supply a mass to gluons through the anderson ",
    "higgs mechanism , but the remaining massless excitation is the ng boson corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of the baryon u(1)@xmath1 symmetry .",
    "in addition , there are a massive complex triplet and singlet as well as a real singlet of scalar diquarks in the mass spectrum of the model .",
    "in the present paper the two - point 1pi green functions of scalar and pseudoscalar diquarks are investigated in the framework of a three flavor njl model with massless quarks and nonzero chemical potential @xmath0 .",
    "the model contains interaction terms both in the quark - antiquark and quark - quark channels , but the  t hooft six - quark term is omitted , for simplicity ( see ( [ 1 ] ) ) . in this case , the initial symmetry group of the model , i. e. su(3)@xmath2su(3)@xmath188su(3)@xmath4u(1)@xmath131u(1)@xmath23 does contain the axial u(1)@xmath23 subgroup . as a result , we have shown that at sufficiently low values of @xmath0 , @xmath189 mev , the normal quark matter phase with su(3)@xmath190su(3)@xmath191u(1)@xmath1 is realized and nine massless pseudoscalar mesons ( which are the ng bosons ) , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath49 , appear .",
    "( in massless qcd , where u(1)@xmath23 is broken on the quantum level , or in njl models with",
    " t hooft interaction the @xmath49-meson is not a ng boson . )    at @xmath111 the original symmetry of the model is spontaneously broken down to su(3)@xmath5 , and the cfl phase does occur . in this case , in accordance with the goldstone theorem , eighteen ng bosons must appear in the mass spectrum . considering 1pi green functions , we have found nine ng bosons in the sector of scalar diquark excitations .",
    "eight of them have to be considered as non - physical , since in real qcd they supply masses to gluons by the anderson ",
    "higgs mechanism .",
    "the remaining scalar ng boson corresponds to a spontaneous breaking of the baryon u(1)@xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the other nine ng bosons are no more pseudoscalar mesons , but now the massless excitations in the pseudoscalar diquark sector of the model .",
    "besides ng diquarks , we have proved the existence of massive diquark excitations in the cfl phase .",
    "they form both pseudoscalar and scalar complex ( charged ) triplets and singlets as well as a real ( neutral ) singlet of the group su(3)@xmath187 .",
    "there arises the interesting question , whether these diquark masses are above the threshold of fermion pair excitations so that massive diquarks might eventually decay into two ng bosons . and",
    "@xmath120 quarks ( see the papers @xcite ) , indicate that massive diquarks may occur as resonances which are heavily damped .",
    "however , the situation in the cfl phase might be different and needs a special consideration . ]",
    "the detailed numerical investigation of diquark masses as functions of the chemical potential is outside the scope of this paper and will be considered in a future publication .",
    "there , we are going to study also the masses of mesons in the environment of dense quark matter in the cfl phase .",

    "gorkov representation the inverse quark propagator matrix @xmath192 is given in ( [ 9 ] ) .",

    "this prescription correctly implements the role of @xmath0 as the chemical potential and preserves the causality of the theory . )",
    "it is clear from ( [ 121])-([124 ] ) that all color- and flavor dependences in the matrix elements @xmath201 and @xmath202 arise only due to the matrix @xmath105 . in the nine - dimensional space @xmath203 , which is the direct production of color and flavor spaces , the two @xmath204 matrices @xmath105 and",
    "@xmath205 take the following forms @xmath206 thus , the quark propagator @xmath82 may be thought as the matrix in the @xmath203 space as well . since it is an infinite series in powers of @xmath105 , the diagonalization of the matrix @xmath105 means the diagonalization of the propagator @xmath82 in the @xmath203 space .",
    "let us define in the @xmath203 space the following matrix ( its rows are the ortonormal eigenvectors of the @xmath105-matrix , corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath207 ) : @xmath208 evidently , we have @xmath209 , det@xmath210=1 and @xmath211diag@xmath212 @xmath213diag@xmath214 .",

    "hence , in the clf phase all nine quasiparticles form an su(3)-octet with gap @xmath218 and an su(3)-singlet with gap @xmath220 ( see also @xcite ) .",
