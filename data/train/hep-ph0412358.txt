    "in the previous paper @xcite the extensive analysis of two measured global variables , transverse energy ( @xmath3 ) and charged particle multiplicity ( @xmath2 ) densities at midrapidity , was delivered .",
    "the analysis was done in the framework of the single freeze - out statistical model @xcite for the most central collision cases of ags , sps and rhic .",
    "now the same method will be applied in the examination of the centrality dependence of the above - mentioned variables and their ratio .",
    "the main idea of this method is as follows .",
    "thermal and geometric parameters of the model are determined from fits to the particle yield ratios and @xmath1 spectra , respectively .",
    "then , with the use of these parameters both densities , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , can be estimated numerically and compared with the data .",
    "the first part of this two - step prescription has been already done for the existing midrapidity data for different centrality bins at rhic at @xmath0 and 200  gev @xcite . in the present paper",
    "the second step will be performed , namely the estimations of @xmath3 and @xmath2 for these centralities and comparison with the data reported in refs .",
    "the main reason for doing it is that the transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity measurements are independent of hadron spectroscopy ( in particular , no particle identification is necessary ) , therefore they could be used as an additional test of the self - consistency of a statistical model .",
    "there is also an additional pragmatic reason : predictions of variety of theoretical models were confronted with the data in @xcite , but none of these models was a statistical model .    the experimentally measured transverse energy is defined as    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the polar angle , @xmath8 denotes @xmath9 ( @xmath10 means the nucleon mass ) for baryons , @xmath11 for antibaryons and the total energy @xmath12 for all other particles , and the sum is taken over all @xmath13 emitted particles @xcite .    as a statistical model",
    "the single freeze - out model is applied ( for details see @xcite ) . the model succeeded in the accurate description of ratios and @xmath1 spectra of particles measured at rhic @xcite .",
    "the main postulate of the model is the simultaneous occurrence of chemical and thermal freeze - outs , which means that the possible elastic interactions after the chemical freeze - out are neglected .",
    "the conditions for the freeze - out are expressed by values of two independent thermal parameters : @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the strangeness chemical potential @xmath16 is determined from the requirement that the overall strangeness equals zero .",
    "the second basic feature of the model is the complete treatment of resonance decays .",
    "this means that the final distribution of a given particle consists not only of the thermal part but also of contributions from all possible decays and cascades .",
    "the main assumptions of the model are as follows .",
    "a noninteracting gas of stable hadrons and resonances at chemical and thermal equilibrium appears at the latter stages of a heavy - ion collision .",
    "the gas cools and expands , and after reaching the freeze - out point it ceases .",
    "the chemical and thermal freeze - outs take place simultaneously .",
    "all confirmed resonances up to a mass of @xmath17 gev from the particle data tables @xcite , together with stable hadrons , are constituents of the gas .",
    "the freeze - out hypersurface is defined by the equation    @xmath18    the four - velocity of an element of the freeze - out hypersurface is proportional to its coordinate    @xmath19    the following parameterization of the hypersurface is chosen :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the rapidity of the element , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 controls the transverse radius :    @xmath24    the transverse size is restricted by the condition @xmath25 .",
    "this means that two new parameters of the model have been introduced , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which are connected with the geometry of the freeze - out hypersurface .    the invariant distribution of the measured particles of species @xmath28 has the form @xcite",
    "@xmath29    where @xmath30 is the normal vector on a freeze - out hypersurface , @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the four - velocity of a fluid element and @xmath33 is the final momentum distribution of the particle in question .",
    "the final distribution means here that @xmath33 is the sum of primordial and simple and sequential decay contributions to the particle distribution .",
    "the primordial part of @xmath33 is given by a bose - einstein or a fermi - dirac distribution at the freeze - out .",
    "a decay contribution is a one - dimensional or multidimensional integral of the momentum distribution of a decaying resonance ( the exact formulae are obtained from the elementary kinematics of a many - body decay or the superposition of such decays , for details see @xcite and the appendix in @xcite ) .",
    "the resonance is a constituent of the hadron gas and its distribution is also given by the bose - einstein ( fermi - dirac ) distribution function .",
    "therefore the final distribution @xmath33 depends explicitly on @xmath14 and @xmath15 .    with the use of eqs .",
    "( [ velochyp ] ) and ( [ parahyp ] ) , the invariant distribution ( [ cooper ] ) takes the following form :    @xmath34    where    @xmath35    note that the above distribution is explicitly boost invariant .",
    "the pseudorapidity density of particle species @xmath28 is given by    @xmath36    analogously , the transverse energy pseudorapidity density for the same species can be written as    @xmath37    for the quantities at midrapidity one has ( in the c.m.s . , which is the rhic frame of reference )    @xmath38    @xmath39    note that for the older data from rhic at @xmath0 gev @xcite the _ antibaryon _ case is not distinguished and the corresponding expression for the transverse energy density is the same as for all other particles .",
    "the overall charged particle and transverse energy densities can be expressed as    @xmath40    @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) denote sets of species of finally detected particles , namely the set of charged particles @xmath43 comprises @xmath45 and @xmath46 , whereas @xmath42 also includes photons , @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "analyses of the particle ratios and @xmath1 spectra at various centralities in the framework of the single freeze - out model were done for rhic in @xcite . here is the brief summary of this approach .",
    "it proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , thermal parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 are fitted with the use of the experimental ratios of hadron multiplicities at midrapidity .",
    "after then two next parameters , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , are determined from the simultaneous fit to the transverse - momentum spectra of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath46 .",
    "the fits are performed with the help of the @xmath52 method . for the @xmath53th",
    "measured quantity @xmath54 and its theoretical equivalent @xmath55 , which depends on @xmath56 parameters @xmath57 , the @xmath52 function is defined as    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the error of the @xmath53th measurement and @xmath60 is the total number of data points .",
    "the fitted values of parameters mean the values at which @xmath52 has a minimum .    to determine @xmath14 and @xmath15 the @xmath53th measured ratio of hadron multiplicities at midrapidity is put into eq .",
    "( [ chidef ] ) as the measured quantity :    @xmath61    in the case of a boost - invariant model ( as here ) , the theoretical equivalent @xmath62 is given by    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the final density of particle species @xmath28 calculated for a static gas .",
    "the last equality follows from the assumption that the temperature and chemical potentials are constant on the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "then the volume of the hypersurface factorizes when the invariant distribution ( [ cooper ] ) is integrated formally over all momenta to obtain the total multiplicity @xmath65 ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the final density means here that it collects all decay contributions .",
    "thus the final density of particle species @xmath28 reads    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the thermal density of the @xmath68th particle species at the freeze - out , @xmath69 is the final number of particles of species @xmath28 which can be received from all possible simple or sequential decays of particle @xmath68 and the sum is over all species of resonances included in the hadron gas .",
    "the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 were fixed for both rhic energies ( _ i.e. _ @xmath0 and 200 gev ) with the use of data for the most central collisions @xcite . in the further considerations",
    "it is assumed that these values are independent of the centrality .",
    "this is reasonable since the very weak centrality dependence of the particle ratios has been observed so far .",
    "recent analyses done in @xcite have just confirmed the above - mentioned assumption .    the second step of this approach is to determine values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "now the @xmath53th measured quantity @xmath54 is the value of @xmath70 for measured particle species @xmath28 and its transverse momentum @xmath1 , whereas the theoretical equivalent @xmath71 is given by the formula ( [ cooper2 ] ) .",
    "note that again the @xmath52 function depends on two free parameters , now @xmath26 and @xmath27 , since the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which were determined early , have been put into eq .",
    "( [ cooper2 ] ) .",
    "the fitted values of parameters of the model are taken from @xcite and are gathered in table  [ table1 ] . since not all bins reported in @xcite were examined , the lacking values of the geometric parameters have been obtained from the linear approximation between the nearest up and down neighbors .",
    "this is justified because the geometric parameters , when plotted as a function of centrality , show roughly linear dependence @xcite .",
    "also in table  [ table1 ] the corresponding number of participants ( @xmath72 ) is given for each bin .",
    "if the division into centrality classes is different for the identified charged hadron measurements and the @xmath4 and @xmath5 measurements , values of @xmath72 are taken from reports on the former .",
    "therefore values of @xmath72 from @xcite are listed for phenix , whereas values of @xmath72 for star are taken from its transverse energy measurement analysis @xcite ( in @xcite numbers of participants are not given ) .",
    ".[table1 ] values of thermal and geometric parameters of the model for various centrality bins taken from @xcite . marked",
    "are these bins , for which values of geometric parameters have been obtained by the author from linear approximation between the nearest neighbours ( see the text for the explanation ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the results of numerical estimations of @xmath2 , eq .  ( [ nchall ] ) , divided by the number of participant pairs for phenix centrality bins tabulated in table  [ table1 ] are presented in figs.[fig.1 ] and [ fig.2 ] for @xmath0 and 200 gev respectively . additionally to the straightforward phenix measurements of the total charged particle multiplicity , also",
    "the data from the summing up of the integrated charged hadron yields are depicted in these figures ( more precisely , since the integrated charged hadron yields are given as rapidity densities , the transformation to pseudo - rapidity should be done , which means the division by a factor 1.2 here , see @xcite ) .",
    "this is because fits of the parameters of the model should be done to the same @xmath1 spectra which are to be integrated to delivered the charged hadron yields . for phenix at @xmath73 gev",
    "this is not true since fits were done to the preliminary data @xcite , but the integrated charged hadron yields were delivered in the final report @xcite . and as one can see from a comparison between figures in @xcite and @xcite , points from the former are slightly above corresponding points from the latter . to estimate the scale of this difference , the sum of integrated charged hadron yields at @xmath74 ( the point of the biggest discrepancy between the model evaluation and the experimental data , see fig.[fig.2 ] ) has been obtained again from digitizing the data depicted in preliminary plots in @xcite .",
    "this gives 3.31 of charged particles per participant pair , which is exactly @xmath75 above the value obtained from the data given in @xcite .",
    "and the model evaluation is only @xmath76 greater than this number .",
    "also in @xcite the feeding of @xmath77 from @xmath78 decays is excluded , contrary to @xcite .",
    "therefore , the model estimates should overestimate the corresponding recalculated experimental values for phenix at @xmath73 gev . to diminish this effect , integrated @xmath51 and @xmath46 yields delivered in @xcite , were corrected to include back the feeding .",
    "the correction was done by the division by a factor 0.65 , which is rough average of a @xmath1 dependent multiplier used by the phenix collaboration ( see fig.4 and eq.(5 ) in @xcite ) . since",
    "all just stated reasons for the `` systematic '' discrepancies affect the absolute values of @xmath2 , they reveal themselves in the normalization factor @xmath79 in the model ( see eq .",
    "( [ cooper2 ] ) ) . for phenix at @xmath0",
    "gev the same spectra were used to fit the model parameters and to obtain the integrated yields @xcite , so the predictions should agree with the recalculated data in principle . as one can notice from figs.[fig.1 ] and [ fig.2 ] , the above comments concerning both phenix measurements are true .",
    "the greatest overestimation is in the most peripheral bin and in the mid - centrality region of the measurements at @xmath73 gev .",
    "but even at the worst point the model prediction is @xmath80 over the corresponding recalculated experimental value .",
    "it is not so bad because the absolute value of theoretical @xmath5 is determined by the factor @xmath79 .",
    "this means that the @xmath81 uncertainty in @xmath26 is enough to cause the @xmath80 uncertainty in @xmath5 .",
    "the second reason for the quantitative disagreement is that transverse momentum spectra are measured in _ limited ranges _",
    ", so very important low-@xmath1 regions are not covered by the data . to obtain integrated yields some extrapolations below and above the measured ranges are used .",
    "in fact these extrapolations are only analytical fits , but contributions from regions covered by them account for about @xmath82 of the integrated yields @xcite .",
    "it might turned out that these extrapolations differ from the thermal distributions supplemented by the distributions of products of decays .",

    "only the rough qualitative agreement has been reached and the reasons have just been explained .",
    "it is also worth to stress once more , that the discrepancy between the directly measured @xmath5 and @xmath5 expressed as the sum of the integrated charged hadron yields can be one of these reasons , especially for rhic at @xmath73 gev ( see fig[fig.2 ] ; this effect has already been notified in backup slides of @xcite ) .",

    "the quality of the model predictions for @xmath4 measured by phenix is the same as for @xmath5 .",
    "again , only the qualitative agreement has been reached in the case of @xmath73 gev but the overestimation is higher and equals @xmath85 at most .",
    "the main source of the overestimation seems to be the same as in the @xmath5 case , namely the uncertainty of fitting the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the star measurements need separate comments .",
    "the star data were taken not at midrapidity ( @xmath84 ) as in the phenix case but at @xmath86 on the average @xcite .",
    "but the @xmath1 spectra used for fits of the geometric parameters were measured at midrapidity , also in the star case @xcite .",
    "therefore one should expect some `` systematic '' discrepancy between predictions and the data on the whole . to remove this effect the original star data @xcite have been divided by a factor @xmath87 . as it can be seen from fig.[fig.4 ] , the predictions and data agree with each other within errors besides the most central point .",
    "but even there , the discrepancy does not overcome @xmath88 .",
    "of course , the second source of the quantitative disagreement could be the uncertainty in @xmath26 ( in fact , as it will be seen , it seems to be the main source of the disagreement in all discussed cases ) .",
    "fig.[fig.4 ] also shows that both experimental and theoretical values of the transverse energy per participant pair corresponding to the star case are @xmath89 greater than the phenix ones .",
    "as far as the theoretical estimates are concerned this is the consequence of the higher values of @xmath1 distributions of pions , kaons and antiprotons measured by the star collaboration with respect to phenix measurements ( it can be seen directly from careful comparison of spectra given in @xcite and @xcite , in fact such a comparison was done in @xcite , see fig.5 there ) .",
    "however , it is difficult to judge without doubts what is the reason for the normalization difference between the experimental data . additionally , it is interesting that this difference decreases with the centrality .",
    "one of the reasons could be a different fiducial aperture : in the phenix case measurements were done for @xmath90 in pseudo - rapidity and @xmath91 in azimuth , whereas in the star case the pseudo - rapidity range was @xmath92 and the azimuthal coverage @xmath93 . in both cases",
    "the correction factor for fiducial acceptance is given by @xmath94 , which implicitly assumes the uniform distribution of the raw @xmath83 data in the covered pseudo - rapidity range and in the azimuthal angle .",
    "of course , it might not be exactly true and the final difference in the data could reflect slight deviations from this expected uniformity .",
    "another point is a rather rough technique used by the author to rescaled the star data to @xmath95 .",
    "the division by a factor @xmath87 contributes almost @xmath96 percentage points to the mentioned @xmath89 increase in the normalization .",
    "anyway , the increase in the normalization of the transverse - energy measurements observed in the star data with respect to the phenix data is consistent with the similar increase in the normalization of the measured spectra .",
    "@xmath97 versus @xmath72 for rhic at @xmath0 gev and for the older definition of @xmath83 , _",

    "as one can see , the position of model predictions is very regular and exactly resembles the configuration of the data in each case , the estimates are only shifted up about @xmath75 as a whole .",
    "this indirectly proves that the earlier discussed disagreement in estimates of @xmath2 and @xmath3 has its origin in the uncertainty of fitting the parameter @xmath26 ( the normalization factor @xmath79 cancels in the ratio ) .",
    "the observed @xmath75 overestimation of the ratio can be explained , at least for more central collisions , by the observed discrepancy between the directly measured @xmath5 and @xmath5 expressed as the sum of the integrated charged hadron yields . if the original data points are replaced by the recalculated data such that the denominators are sums of the integrated charged hadron yields , then much better agreement can be reached for all but peripheral collisions ( see figs.[fig.5]-[fig.7 ] ) .",
    "the single freeze - out model has been applied to estimate transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity densities for different centrality bins of rhic measurements at @xmath0 and @xmath98 gev .",
    "these two variables are independent observables , which means that they are measured independently of identified hadron spectroscopy .",
    "since model fits were done to identified hadron data ( particle yield ratios and @xmath1 spectra ) and transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity densities are calculable in the single freeze - out model , it was very tempting to check whether their estimated values agree with the data .",
    "generally the answer is yes , at least on the qualitative level . as it has just turned out , the main source of the quantitative disagreement is the uncertainty in the value of the parameter @xmath26 .",
    "the uncertainty strongly influences both densities since their theoretical equivalents contain the normalization factor @xmath79 .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by the analysis of the transverse energy per charged particle as a function of the number of participating pairs .",
    "the overestimation of at most @xmath85 obtained for the absolute value of the transverse energy density decreases to the overall overestimation of the order of @xmath75 for the ratio @xmath99 . on the quantitative level",
    "this means that values of only three parameters of the model are confirmed in the present analysis , namely @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the ratio @xmath100 .",
    "since the ratio is directly connected with the maximum transverse - flow parameter ( for the derivation see @xcite ) ,      this set of parameters is equivalent to @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath102 , which are more commonly used in other statistical models describing particle production in heavy - ion collisions ( _ e.g. _ the blast - wave model @xcite ) .    to summarize",
    ", the single freeze - out version of a statistical model fairly well explains the observed centrality dependence of transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity pseudo - rapidity densities at midrapidity and their ratio .",
    "also the dependence on @xmath103 of the above - mentioned variables is well recovered @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed once more , that this model very well reproduces the particle ratios and the transverse - momentum spectra measured at rhic @xcite . in fact , the description of the identified hadron data was the original motivation for the formulation of the model in @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper confirm , in an independent way , the general conclusion drawn in the above - mentioned references , that the single freeze - out model is a very useful ( and simple ) tool for the estimations of fundamental physical parameters like the temperature , chemical potentials or the size of the matter created at the final stages of a heavy - ion collision .",
    "this supports the idea of the appearance of a thermal system during such a collision .",
