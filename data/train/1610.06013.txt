    "recently a clear and prominent resonance structure was observed at the wasa@cosy detector of forschungszentrum jlich in double pionic - fusion @xmath5 @xcite and later in isospin associated @xmath6 but not in the isovector channel @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "its mass is reported as 2380 mev , somewhat below two @xmath8 masses , and its width as 70 mev , and in the particle zoo it has been nominated as @xmath4 . the structure is also seen in non - fusion reactions with isotopically freer four - body final states @xmath9 @xcite . thus , along with spin polarized measurements @xcite , the internal quantum numbers @xmath10 have been also fixed .",
    "the interpretation of this resonance has been suggested as a genuine dibaryon both without @xcite and with explicit quark level calculations @xcite .",
    "considering that the resonance , whatever it is , decays mainly through @xmath1 it is understandable that the latter calculations indicate a dominance of @xmath1 in the state wave function ( about 2/3 ) and the rest perhaps of more exotic six - quark structure .",
    "the quota of the six - quark contents would decrease the width of the resonance below two times the free @xmath3 width suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite . in contrast , a dynamic three - body calculation @xcite can reproduce both the mass and width without extra explicit quark contents beyond conventional hadrons , nucleons , @xmath3 s and pions . these calculations",
    ", however , contained a somewhat fictitious stable @xmath11 to simulate the effect of @xmath3 in @xmath12 interaction , which might raise questions about the small width of the ensuing resonance .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to study in a simple phenomenological way the effect of the relative kinetic energy between the two baryons to see how or if it decreases the effective decay width of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 two - baryon systems .",
    "obviously this kinetic portion is not available for the ( internal ) pionic decay of the @xmath3 s . because , the wave function is necessarily also spatially constrained ( must die asymptotically ) the kinetic energy is not arbitrary and its average is finite",
    "this kinematic suppression of the width was taken into account long ago in calculations for @xmath13 @xcite , but the width results were never explicitly published .",
    "further , also a strong sensitivity can be expected on the relative orbital angular momentum of the baryons , which must give rise to quantized energy levels in closed channels .",
    "actually a rotational spectrum @xmath14 mev was seen on top of the @xmath3 and nucleon mass difference in a coupled channels @xmath15 scattering calculation @xcite in good agreement with the isospin one `` dibaryon '' masses given in ref .",
    "this would correspond to a centrifugal barrier height for baryons approximately at one femtometer distance from each other , roughly the distance at which the @xmath0 wave function maximizes .",
    "first the system with a single @xmath3 is treated in sec .",
    "ii to introduce the basic ideas and kinematics before proceeding to @xmath1 of particular interest in the context of the @xmath4 resonance in sec . iii .",
    "in many works ( e.g. on pion production reactions such as @xmath16 ) the effect of the @xmath3 is taken into account by simply including the @xmath17 mass difference and width in second order perturbation calculations into the energy denominator as @xmath18 . as a trivial consequence , in gross features",
    "this gives the energy dependence of the total cross section right , which in this example around the resonant peak is dominated by a single partial wave chain @xmath19 , ( with also a significant contribution from @xmath20 , affecting importantly in differential and spin observables @xcite ) . in the momentum ( or energy ) representation this prescription is obvious and simple .",
    "however , the changes suggested in the introduction to the @xmath0 kinematics are not necessarily accounted for .",
    "further , in different partial waves the centrifugal barrier affects the magnitude of the @xmath3 contribution and can displace the peaking , so that differential observables displaying interferences do not come out right @xcite .",
    "wave function at energies 400 , 578 and 765 mev without the width ( dashed , solid and dotted curves , respectively ) .",
    "the dash - dot curve has the width included at 578 mev .",
    "the normalization is associated with the @xmath21 wave function asymptotic form @xmath22 .",
    "[ wavef ] ]    as the present calculations are performed in the configuration space , it is also illustrative to see how the peaking itself arises with wave functions obtained from the coupled @xmath23 schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "[ wavef ] shows the most important component @xmath24 of the initial wave function in the pion production reaction @xmath16 . below the nominal @xmath0 mass",
    "this channel is obviously closed and exponentially decreasing as a function of the distance ( dashed curve for @xmath25 mev ) . at the @xmath0 threshold , lacking either positive or negative kinetic energy the wave function becomes essentially a straight curve outside the potential range @xmath26 fm ( solid curve at 578 mev ) .",
    "depending on the details of the energy and the interaction this could , in principle , be a horizontal constant , maximizing any overlap transition integrals ( in the case of this reaction with the long - ranged deuteron and relatively low energy pion ) .",
    "it may be noted that already at 600 mev this line crosses the @xmath27 axis at 4.6 fm introducing the first oscillation at distances small enough to cause significant overlap reduction . at still higher energies oscillations",
    "attain shorter wave lengths and begin to cancel the transition matrix integral ( dotted curve ) . as a consequence",
    "there is a strong peaking of the production cross section at the @xmath0 threshold far higher than the data @xcite .",
    "however , once the @xmath3 width is included in the equation of motion as a constant negative imaginary potential ( as presented in the following discussion ) , the channel becomes again asymptotically closed . as can be seen ( dash - dot curve at 578 mev ) the wave function becomes strongly moderated at short distances and the oscillating wave will be exponentially attenuated at large distances with a consequent suppression of the transition at and above the @xmath0 threshold .",
    "so the natural inputs for the configuration space equation of motion , the schrdinger equation , lead to similar resonance like behaviour as can be obtained by explicitly forcing it by hand in the momentum and energy representation ( see e.g. @xcite ) . with the closure of the channels also",
    "similar quantization phenomena appear as for bound states but , however , smeared with the uncertainties associated with the width .",
    "as stated previously , the centrifugal barriers ( or the coulomb force if necessary ) can be included with important effects on the differential observables with interfering amplitudes ( for @xmath16 see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite vs. @xcite ) .",
    "the width is standardly taken to be the free width of the @xmath3 associated with the available c.m.s .",
    "@xmath21 energy .",
    "however , as will be seen , also in this dynamic input quantity the effect of the relative @xmath0 kinetic energy is significant and dependent on the angular momentum",
    ". this should be subtracted from the internal energy available for the @xmath3 decay , so that effectively the two - baryon width becomes smaller than the `` free '' width ( which would correspond to zero relative energy of the baryons ) .",
    "further , in these reactions in different partial waves also the @xmath0 centrifugal barrier directly diminishes the wave functions .",
    "although this suppression is particularly sensitive to @xmath28 , even the orbital angular momentum of the initial nucleons may favour transitions into @xmath0 in some sense .",
    "namely , within the interaction range a reduction of the centrifugal barrier can compensate the @xmath0 mass difference in the excitation if @xmath29 , as seen in ref .",
    "@xcite as an explanation for @xmath30 enhancements ( @xmath31 `` dibaryons '' ) .",
    "from the above considerations it is clear that just a single number can not account for the effective two - baryon pole position in different partial waves .",
    "the thick lines present the @xmath3 s .",
    "[ deltas ] ]    ref . @xcite considered among other things these effects explicitly by calculating the width into the three - body final state of fig .

    "energy @xmath37 .",
    "the triangle function @xmath38 is introduced in its various forms e.g. in ref .",

    "@xcite and later work with @xmath42 final states also included the explicit contribution from this cross section so that the equality @xmath43 was self - consistently satisfied , when @xmath44 was used in the coupled - channels calculation giving @xmath45 as the total inelasticity and the consequent baryon wave functions to calculate the @xmath46 amplitudes . here",
    "the latter term is assumed to be the two - body ( @xmath47 ) contribution @xmath48 to the total width . although the present work is not aimed at pion production _",
    "per se _ , this prescription is nevertheless mainly used in this section .",
    "the effect of @xmath48 is negligible for @xmath21 partial waves other than @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where it can contribute about 1020% .",
    "it may be noted that , of course , this increases the width somewhat and thus acts against the suppression effect claimed here .",
    "finally , as the free @xmath3 width input i use a fit to data @xcite @xmath51 with the characteristic @xmath52-wave resonance behaviour and a soft form factor .",
    "in addition to the limiting constraints on allowed momenta in eq .",
    "( [ gamma3 ] ) , a decisive input necessary is the wave function of the @xmath0 intermediate state , assuming it to originate from e.g. @xmath21 scattering . in this case perturbation theory with @xmath3 s is problematic , since there are no unperturbed @xmath0 wave functions at hand to start with .",
    "however , the more exact coupled channels approach offers probably the best candidates for such wave functions , and this method is used here .",
    "the coupled system of schrdinger equations is solved for each incident nucleon state with the phenomenological reid potential @xcite as the starting point .",
    "the old age of the interaction does not matter much , since once the coupling to the excited intermediate @xmath0 state is invoked , additional strong attraction is gained , which must , anyway , be counteracted to avoid double counting .",
    "this is performed by changing the diagonal @xmath21 part so that the total interaction reproduces the phase shifts @xcite reasonably well below the resonance ( or @xmath0 threshold ) .",
    "@xcite presents such a change to the most important and sensitive @xmath21 states @xmath49 and @xmath53 ( in the original reid potential ) to be used in this section .",

    "@xcite has been fine - tuned to give the height of the @xmath61 peak at the right place @xmath62580 mev and may be trusted here , too .",
    "this peak is possibly the most sensitive probe of the transition potential .",
    "the potential involves pion and @xmath63-meson exchanges .",
    "the latter may be described by contact terms in recent effective field theories , but the main thing in this context is to have a transition potential which agrees with data .",
    "the role of the width , in turn , is to act as a constant imaginary `` potential '' in the @xmath0 channels of the coupled schrdinger equations and produce inelasticity .",
    "it goes without saying that unitarity is not prevailed as in general not with optical potentials . at two - baryon level",
    "this is probably closest one can get to reality in the case of pion production .",
    "it is useful to note that besides introducing inelasticity the inclusion of the width also acts as effective repulsion ; for moderate inelasticities more imaginary interaction means less attraction .",

    "a secondary criterium was to keep the transition potential radially the same by limiting the discussion to the spin changing tensor part and thus minimizing inessential diversions ( the spin - spin part is excluded in these states ) .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath0 angular momentum tends to decrease the width as anticipated earlier .",
    "comparison of the @xmath24 ( the highest , thin solid curve ) and the @xmath65 ( the lowest , short dashes ) is a striking example .",

    "the straddling of the @xmath70 ( the dashed curve arising from @xmath69 ) and @xmath71 ( the dotted line from @xmath72 ) is purely accidental and due to the fact that in the latter transition the @xmath0 orbital angular momentum decreases from the @xmath21 , whereas in the former it does not .",

    "the effect is a faster and higher rise of the phase and a subsequent faster fall after the phase maximum and a change of the sign already at 2.44 gev .",
    "also the position of the phase shift maximum is lowered close to 2.41 gev . this result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ argand3 ] by triangles .",
    "also the inelasticity is increased by this attraction though the widths themselves are not changed appreciably by this addition .",
    "adding such an extremely strong attraction is rather a drastic act and one should question how such attraction could arise .",
    "one might speculate about a crossed two - pion exchange ( with the @xmath3 s transforming to nucleons and back ) being attractive in high pion momentum parts .",
    "each @xmath132 vertex has about two times the @xmath133 coupling strength , so the strength from the coupling coefficients alone could give a factor of 16 over the normal @xmath21 two - pion exchange ( without @xmath3 s ) .",
    "however , comparisons with a real potential used here and expectations based on that are not straightforward , since unavoidably one meets on - shell pions with subsequent imaginary parts",
    ". an actually dynamic calculation of the two-@xmath3 width and an associated complex potential on the same basis would be interesting .",
    "the main conclusion of the present work is that the width of the @xmath8 resonance in a two baryon system @xmath0 or @xmath1 is severely decreased due to the relative kinetic energy of the baryons and their relative angular momentum .",
    "since the wave function is necessarily spatially confined , the expectation value of the kinetic energy is finite and out of use for ( internal ) decay of the particles .",
    "further , due to this wave function confinement the energy associated to the angular momentum barrier is quantized to finite average values , also to be subtracted from the energy available to internal excitations and decays .",
    "some obvious rules for the dependencies could be seen in fig .",
    "[ widths ] .",
    "firstly , even the largest of the possible state dependent widths are significantly smaller than the free @xmath3 width at the energy in question ( corresponding to immobile baryons ) .",
    "the lowest angular momentum state has the largest width .",
    "this is associated with effective quantization of the above angular momentum energy , already phenomenologically discussed for @xmath134 dibaryons in ref .",
    "@xcite . the higher orbital angular momentum @xmath0 or @xmath1 states",
    "have increasingly smaller widths . in @xmath21 scattering with these intermediate states also an important factor is whether @xmath28 or @xmath135 is smaller or larger than the initial @xmath136 ( or equal ) . in the first case",
    "the centrifugal barrier difference may partly cancel the mass barrier @xmath137 or @xmath138 thus favoring the formation of the intermediate state , and also in this case the width is larger than in cases where the same intermediate state can be obtained from a lower @xmath136 .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ dgwid ] the effective @xmath1 width is significantly smaller than the single @xmath3 width at the relevant energies , at 2.38 gev about 50 mev , lower than the reported @xmath4 width 70 mev .",
    "this result was obtained with the most important @xmath119 alone .",
    "including the @xmath124-wave @xmath1 s increases the width to 60 mev .",
    "although this is just an input to an @xmath21 scattering calculation , apparently an argument using just the @xmath4 width vs. the free @xmath3 width ( not to say twice this ) is not necessarily assuring for its exotic origin .    the use of the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation might be questioned in this calculation .",
    "relativistic kinematics has been used to get the center - of - mass @xmath21 momentum and energy to meet correctly the @xmath0 or @xmath1 threshold .",
    "the subsequent nonrelativistic continuation should not , however , falsify the above rather general and obvious results , which are not sensitive to this treatmentat least and in particular for the widths .    by this input alone one can not obtain a resonant @xmath54 structure as low as 2.38 gev , only at the @xmath1 threshold ( the calculated phase shift maximum at 2.43 gev using the @xmath3 pole position as the mass ) . adding arbitrarily as a test a strong attraction of pion range it was possible to move the structure at least down to 2.41 gev",
    ". however , the question would remain about the origin of such strong attraction , whether it could be hadronic ( e.g. meson exchanges ) or possibly due to coupling to a genuine six - quark configuration .",
    "theoretically at least the @xmath1 threshold should be there .",
    "can one see two separate structures or have they merged together as suggested by bugg @xcite that resonances tend to synchronize together with thresholds ?",
