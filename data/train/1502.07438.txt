    "in recent years , an increasing number of observations have shattered the paradigm of globular clusters ( gcs ) as simple stellar population systems .",
    "when the first high resolution spectroscopic data became available , it was immediately recognised that gcs host stars with different composition in proton ( @xmath10 ) capture elements ( see reviews by kraft 1994 ; gratton et al.2004 ) .",
    "later on , the advent of 8m - class telescopes with multi - object spectrographs enabled a substantial increase in statistics , from which it has become clear that stars with _ non field - like _ abundances constitute a significant fraction of their parent clusters and they were observed along the whole colour - magnitude diagram ( e.g. cannon et al.1998 ; gratton et al.2001 ; marino et al.2008 ; carretta et al.2009 ) .",
    "the most acknowledged scenario is that the chemical variations in @xmath10-capture elements are due to the presence of multiple stellar generations in gcs , with some being enriched in the products of high temperature h - burning , such as na and n. however , internal star - to - star variations in @xmath10-capture elements may be due to early disk accretion , rather than to the presence of multiple stellar generations ( bastian et al.2013 ) . in any case , this phenomenon to date , seems to be a typical feature of galactic gcs .",
    "these features are also visible in the form of multiple sequences , mostly in the ultraviolet bands , on the gcs colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) , from the main sequence ( ms ) up to the red - giant branch ( rgb ; e.g.marino et al.2008 ; milone et al.2012 ) .    for a long time ,",
    "variations in the overall metallicity , here considered primarily as fe , and/or in neutron ( @xmath11 ) capture elements were considered a strict peculiarity of the most massive cluster @xmath9  centauri ( e.g. norris & da costa1995 ; johnson & pilachowski 2010 ; marino et al.2011 ) .",
    "for this reason , this object was associated with the nuclear remnant of a dwarf galaxy rather than with a real gc ( e.g.bekki & freeman 2003 ; bekki & norris 2006 ) .",
    "more recently , other objects with internal variations in metallicity have been identified , including m22 ( marino et al.2009 ; da costa et al.2009 ) .",
    "interestingly , a clear bimodality in @xmath12 ( @xmath1 ) @xmath11-capture elements was found in this gc , with @xmath1-cno - enriched stars having a higher overall metallicity ( marino et al.2009,2011 ; roederer et al.2012 ; alves brito et al.2012 ) .",
    "following the discovery of metallicity variations in m22 , the number of clusters known to have variations in metallicity has increased substantially , and now includes m54 ( carretta et al.2010 ) , terzan5 ( ferraro et al.2009 ) , m2 ( yong et al.2014 ) , for which high - resolution spectroscopy is available , and ngc5824 ( da costa et al.2014 ) , whose metallicities have been inferred from the ca triplet analysis in low - resolution data . among these gcs , chemical variations in @xmath1-process elements have been studied and confirmed , besides @xmath9  centauri and m22 , in m2 ( yong et al.2014 ) ; while we are aware of c+n+o variations only in @xmath9  centauri and m22 .",
    "a possible small metallicity spread , at the level of a few hundredths of dex , has been proposed also for ngc1851 ( carretta et al.2010 ; gratton et al.2013 ; marino et al.2014 ) , which also shows internal variations in the @xmath1-elements ( yong & grundahl2008 ; villanova et al.2010 ) and in the overall c+n+o content ( yong et al.2014 ) .",
    "although the presence of fe variations in ngc1851 needs further confirmation , enough evidence exists for it to be classified as a gc with chemical _ anomalies _ with respect to the bulk of galactic gcs , such as the @xmath1-elements and c+n+o variations , that have been seen also in @xmath9  centauri and m22 , but are not typically observed in milky way clusters .",
    "we therefore include ngc1851 in the list of clusters with chemical _ anomalies _ with respect to the bulk of galactic gcs .- elements , as that found in other gcs with fe variations . at the moment",
    "we do not include this object in our list of _ anomalous _ gcs . ]",
    "all these findings show that metallicity variations , which were thought to be an exclusive feature of @xmath9  centauri , is actually a more widespread phenomenon in gcs .",
    "the degree of the observed metallicity variations varies from cluster to cluster , with @xmath9  centauri and ngc1851 being the extremes with the widest and lowest fe spreads , respectively .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that these objects able to retain fast supernovae ejecta , were much more massive at their birth , and possibly nuclei of disrupted dwarf galaxies , as suggested for @xmath9  centauri .    on the photometric side ,",
    "these gcs show some _ peculiarities _ , not observed in the other clusters .",
    "the cmd of @xmath9  centauri is the most complex ever observed for a gc , with multiple sequences along all the evolutionary stages , from the ms to a well - extended multimodal horizontal branch ( hb ) , through a complex multiple sub - giant branch ( sgb , e.g.  bellini et al .",
    "however , while the presence of multiple mss and rgbs in uv bands , as well as in some cases extended hbs , are in general good proxies for variations in light elements ( including he for the hb , see milone et al.2014 ) , multiple sgbs are observed in many of the clusters with fe variations , in all photometric bands ( e.g.milone et al.2008 ; piotto et al.2012 ) .",
    "theoretically , multiple sgbs may reflect differences in the overall metallicity and/or c+n+o and/or age ( cassisi et al .",
    "2008 ; marino et al .  2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "two notable examples in this respect are the double sgbs of ngc1851 ( milone et al .",
    "2008 ) and m22 ( e.g. marino et al .  2009 , 2012 ;",
    "piotto et al .",
    "2012 ) . like m22",
    ", ngc1851 has a bimodal distribution in the @xmath1-process elements ( yong & grundahl2008 ; carretta et al.2010 ; villanova et al.2010 ) , and some evidence of variations in the total cno have been provided by yong et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2014 ) .",
    "complex sgb morphologies are present also in m54 and m2 , with the latter exhibiting a triple sgb ( piotto et al.2012 ; milone et al .",
    "2015 ) .    to date metallicity variations are observed in 8 galactic gcs , over the @xmath630 gcs where fe abundances are available for relatively large samples of stars .",
    "note that the true fraction of these objects in the milky way is likely lower as many recent spectroscopic observations are biased because they were aimed at the study of these objects previously identified from photometry .",
    "despite the number of the gcs with variations in fe is expected to increase , these objects still constitute a minor component with respect to monometallic gcs .",
    "the chemical properties of these objects can be regarded as _",
    "anomalies _ with respect to the bulk of gcs in the milky way , indeed we refer to these objects as _ anomalous _ gcs . the term _ anomalous _ will be primarily used to indicate the objects with internal metallicity variation , which on different levels is shared by all these objects .    in this study",
    "we further explore the properties of _ anomalous _ gcs , the plausibility to identify a further class of objects where fe variations are accompanied by variations in @xmath1-elements , and the possibility that a split sgb in a gc constitutes a proxy for its chemical _ anomaly _ , e.g. internal variations in overall metallicity , heavy elements including slow @xmath11-capture elements ( @xmath1-elements ) , and c+n+o .",
    "our aims are to trace how frequent these _ anomalous _ objects occur in the milky way , and to try to disclose their possible formation and early evolution .",
    "a fundamental step to this goal is to understand if they constitute a separate class of objects from typical galactic gcs , originated in a different way ; or they simply form as typical _ normal _ gcs and their chemical anomalies are due to more advanced stages of evolution . the @xmath1-process enrichment due to low - mass agb needs some hundreds myrs to occur ; and at the time this enrichment starts to be effective , the fe - enriched material from supernovae , previously expelled from the cluster , may fall - back into the gc potential well and contribute to the formation of a new stellar generation ( e.g. dantona et al .",
    "2011 for @xmath9  centauri ) .",
    "in this paper we focus on the chemical abundances for a poorly studied gc : ngc5286 .",
    "@xmath13 photometry has demonstrated that this gc shows a split sgb , similar to those observed in ngc1851 and m22 . in this case , however , the stellar component on the fainter sgb constitutes only @xmath614% of the total mass of the cluster , which is significantly lower than in m22 and ngc1851 ( fainter sgb stars in these gcs account for the @xmath638% and @xmath635% respectively ; piotto et al.2012 ) , but larger than in m2 , where its two faint sgb components account for @xmath63% and @xmath61% of all the sgb stars ( milone et al.2015 ) .",
    "with a mass of @xmath14 ( mclaughlin & van der marel 2005 ) , and an absolute visual magnitude of @xmath15 , as listed in the harris catalog ( harris1996 , updated as in 2010 ) , ngc5286 is a relatively massive gc ( as a comparison , m22 has @xmath16 , ngc1851 @xmath17 and m2 @xmath18 ) .",
    "this gc lies at a distance of 8.9  kpc from the galactic centre and 11.7  kpc from the sun , and it is affected by relatively high foreground reddening , with a mean value of @xmath19 ( harris2010 ) .",
    "ngc5286 shows a blue horizontal branch , more than a dozen rr  lyrae variables ( e.g. , clement et al.2001 ) , whose periods are consistent with an oosterhoff  ii type ( zorotovic et al.2010 ) . in this section",
    "we consider in turn the photometric and spectroscopic data that we have employed in this study .",
    "we used photometric data from the wide field imager ( wfi ) of the max planck 2.2 m telescope at la silla collected through the @xmath20 filter under the survey of multiple populations in gcs ( sumo ; program 088.a-9012-a , pi.a.f.marino ) .",

    "@xmath29 photometry has been used to determine atmospheric parameters , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : atm ] .",

    "we couple our @xmath29 photometry ( see sect .  [",

    "this implementation of the irfm has been recently validated also for giants , by direct comparison with interferometric angular diameters ( casagrande et al.2014 ) .",
    "for all stars we assume the cluster metallicity [ fe / h]=@xmath341.69 ( harris 2010 ) , while adopting preliminary estimates for  from isochrones taken from the dartmouth stellar evolution database ( dotter et al2008 ) , which is appropriate since the irfm depends very mildly on those parameters . to investigate the impact of the metallicity and gravity on the temperature values we run the irfm on all the stars by assuming [ fe / h]=@xmath341.49 and [ fe / h]=@xmath341.89 , which corresponds to a metallicity of @xmath380.2  dex around the adopted value of [ fe / h]=@xmath341.69 .",
    "the two sets of temperatures are almost identical , and differ on average by @xmath62  k. we emphasise that a variation of 0.4  dex in [ fe / h ] is more than twice larger than the mean metallicity difference measured in ngc5286 , and conclude that the effect of the adopted metallicity is expected to be negligible on the results of this paper ( see sect .  4 ) .",
    "similarly , a difference in  by 0.5  dex only marginally affects the derived  values , as corresponds to a mean variation for this parameter of @xmath63  k.    as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : phot_data ] , all our photometry is corrected for differential reddening .",
    "this correction is important for gcs like ngc5286 that have a high mean reddening ; indeed our correction suggests relatively high deviations from the absolute @xmath41 value , with maximum variations being @xmath60.1  mag . for the sake of deriving the correct effective temperatures we must also account for the absolute value of reddening , which we assume to be @xmath41=0.24 from harris ( 2010 ) . in our implementation of the irfm ,",
    "the effective temperature of each star is obtained by averaging the values obtained from each infrared band ; their standard deviation also provides an estimate of the internal accuracy of our results , which for this dataset is of order 40  k , indirectly confirming the quality of our differential reddening corrections .",
    "however , this estimate for the photometric  could be derived only for a sample of our stars ( 39/55 ) , that have good 2mass photometry . for the remaining stars",

    "regarding the most reliable -scale , both spectroscopic and photometric scales are likely affected by systematics .",
    "these systematics are due to the used fe lines , adopted log@xmath52 , residual nlte effects in the case of the spectroscopic  scale , and mostly due to the adopted absolute reddening in the case of the photometric  values .",

    "internal variations in metallicity are intriguing because , assumed that they arise from internal chemical evolution , they suggest that material ejected at fast velocities from supernovae ( snii ) could has been retained by these gcs at their early stages of evolution .",

    "the idea that the very extreme gc @xmath9  centauri is the nucleus of a dwarf galaxy was first suggested by bekki & freeman ( 2003 ) .",
    "the discovery of more objects with similar properties , although less extreme , may suggest that these objects may also be surviving nuclei of dwarf galaxies .",
    "this scenario would provide 8 more candidates to alleviate the missing satellites problem , i.e. the lack of observed mw satellites compared to the numbers expected from theoretical simulations ( e.g.kauffmann et al.1993 , klypin et al.1999 , moore et al.1999 )",

    "also , a low - density halo of stars surrounding ngc1851 has been discovered by olsweski et al.(2009 ) , whose chemistry is compatible with the @xmath1-poor group observed in this cluster ( marino et al.2014 ) .",
    "the absence of @xmath1-rich stars in this halo may suggest either that this gc is preferentially losing @xmath1-poor stars into the field , or that this sparse structure is the remnant of a dwarf galaxy , as its composition is compatible with field stars at similar metallicity ( marino et al.2014 ) .",

    "[ fig : histo ] shows the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) for 16 stars in the ultra - faint dwarf galaxy ( ufd ) bootes  i ( from norris et al.2010 ) .",

    "is a common feature among _ anomalous _ gcs .",
    "another difference among _ anomalous _ gcs and dwarf galaxies is the lack , in the latter , of typical ( anti-)correlation patterns among light - elements ( e.g. norris et al.in prep . for carina ) .",
    "we note however that , if the hypothesis of the origin of _ anomalous _ gcs as nuclei of disrupted dwarf galaxies will be confirmed , the chemistry of the dwarfs does not have to necessarily resemble the gcs one , as the latter would constitute just their nuclear regions . in",

    "appear similar to mono - metallic gcs , with their own fe content and their own na - o anticorrelation , it has been proposed that they can result from mergers between different clusters ( e.g. bekki & yong 2012 ) . if this scenario will apply to every anomalous gc",
    ", we will need to understand why in almost all the gcs with internal metallicity variations found so far the increase in metals is coupled with a @xmath1-enrichment . in other words , we should find an explanation for the very similar properties of these objects , while in the hypothesis of a merger of two ( or more ) gcs one would expect a much more heterogenous observational scenario .",
    "it is worth noticing that nearby dwarf and irregular galaxies host their more massive gcs in their central regions , these gcs being _ nuclear _ star clusters ( e.g.georgiev et al.2009 ) .",
    "we do not have , at the moment , any evidence for these nuclear gcs to share the same fe distribution of the parent galaxies , or they show instead fe distributions and chemical patterns more similar to the galactic _ anomalous _ gcs .    to explore further a possible galaxies-_anomalous _ gcs connection we plotted the position of various stellar systems in the half - light radius ( log  ( r@xmath97/pc ) ) vs.absolute-mag ( @xmath98 ) plane ( fig  [ fig : gal ] ) .",

    "it is worth noticing that the mean [ fe / h ] is very similar between ngc5286 , m22 , and m2 .",

    "this would imply that these nuclei formed out chemically similar clouds , probably at similar evolutionary phases of their host galaxies . on the other hand ,",
