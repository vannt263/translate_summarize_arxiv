    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) allows two legitimate users , typically called alice and bob , to share a common bit string with information - theoretic security even in the presence of eavesdroppers @xcite .",
    "since the bb84 @xcite protocol was proposed , tremendous progress has been made , for example , sarg04 qkd @xcite , decoy - state qkd @xcite , measurement - device - independent qkd @xcite , and device - independent qkd @xcite , were proposed to enhance the security of quantum communication .",
    "the security proof of qkd , which leads to the explicit form of the extractable secure key rate the corresponding protocol provides , is closely related to the original version of heisenberg s uncertainty principle @xcite .",
    "it means that any eavesdropper s intervention acquiring the effective private information of quantum states will lead to a disturbance which can be discovered and estimated from a randomly chosen portion of measurement results , namely , monitoring the signal disturbance .",
    "the more disturbance that the eavesdropper ( eve ) should have caused , the less efficient the qkd protocol will be .    recently , sasaki , yamamoto , and koashi proposed a ground - breaking approach , a qudit - based protocol , i.e. , the round - robin differential phase - shift qkd ( rrdps - qkd ) protocol that does not require disturbance monitoring since the limit on leaked information , namely , the portion of the sifted key subjected to privacy amplification , can be acquired in advance and maintains a high tolerance of noise @xcite .",
    "since the rrdps - qkd was proposed , it has been studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . according to the original protocol",
    ", the phase error estimation can be done after alice s preparation in advance without considering eve s interventions , which makes it independent of the bit error rate and thus incredibly desirable for practical implementations of qkd .",
    "specifically , under ideal circumstances , the rrdps - qkd protocol can tolerate a high bit error rate , up to almost @xmath0 , which is significantly different from previous qkd protocols @xcite , such as the qubit - based bb84 protocol , whose bit error rate can not go beyond @xmath1 based on one way classical post - processing @xcite .",
    "however , as pointed out by the authors , a realization of this protocol requires bob to be equipped with photon number resolving detectors ( pnr ) .",
    "this is a problem that all experimental implementations of qkd based on qubit encoding today face , the requirement of photon - counting techniques , as their unconditional security is based on single photon transmission , in which alice sends single photons into insecure quantum channels , and bob only receives single photons . yet in practice , this assumption can not be satisfied due to the fact that weak laser pulses are usually used as the source , which occasionally include more than one photon , and that the eavesdropper may intercept and send multiphotons to the receiver . therefore , for qubit - based quantum communication protocols @xcite , the decoy state method @xcite has solved the multiphoton problems at the source with great enhancements , while squash models @xcite are proposed to solve problems at the detector .    in the rrdps - qkd protocol @xcite ,",
    "a practical vulnerability lies in that bob s measurement device requires experimentally challenging detectors that are able to discriminate between single photons from two or more photons , i.e. , photon number resolving detectors .",
    "laboratories are presently equipped with conventional threshold photon detectors , and while actual pnr detectors are slowly entering commercial use , they are still highly temperature sensitive and can only resolve a limited number of photons received @xcite .",
    "in fact , all experimental demonstrations of rrdps - qkd have used threshold single - photon detectors @xcite . meanwhile , a recent work suggests that with the use of threshold detectors , security can still be achieved without monitoring the signal disturbance by employing a passive delay change at bob s measurement site @xcite . in this paper , we exploit a detector - decoy ( dd ) method that estimates the photon statistics provided by combining a threshold detector together with a variable attenuator ( amplitude modulator ) @xcite to give the bounds to the fraction of detected events by bob from single photons . through simulation and comparison with ref.@xcite , we show that with the photon statistics obtained , we have provided a more advantageous method for feasibly realizing the rrdps - qkd with an enhancement in the key rate results .",
    "the basic procedures of the rrdps - qkd protocol are as follows .",
    "first , alice generates a series of pulse trains , each train with a overall random phase .",
    "then , for each train , alice prepares @xmath2 weak coherent pulses with the bit information encoded in their phases @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the photon number operator for the @xmath7th pulse , @xmath8 is related to the average photon number per pulse with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the average photon number of each train . from there , alice sends the quantum states to bob through an insecure channel . at bob",
    "s measurement site is an unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) with a variable delay at the long arm , which is controlled by a random number generator ( rng ) .",
    "he uses the rng to generate a number @xmath11 , and after some possible intervention from eve , bob detects the signal and acquires the indices @xmath12 , where @xmath13 satisfies @xmath14 , and announces them via a public channel to alice . in practice ,",
    "the outputs of the mzi are adjusted so that superposed pulses of the same phase go to a detector @xmath15 , while pulses of opposite phases go to a detector @xmath16 .",
    "thus , alice records her sifted key as @xmath17 . a schematic diagram of the protocol is shown in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "ideally , bob s measurement outcomes @xmath18 should equal @xmath19 , though in reality it may include some errors . as bob s random choice is after eve s disturbance , the information leaked to eve is very limited because of information causality @xcite . intuitively , eve seems to have some control over the generation of index @xmath13 , though it was shown by a virtual measurement scheme proposed in ref.@xcite that her control is in fact rather limited .",
    "therefore , it is possible to ignore the signal disturbance and analyze errors , namely the privacy amplification , based only on the outcomes of alice and bob .",
    "a crucial condition for the guarantee of this protocol is for bob to only declare a detection event successful when one photon is exactly detected by his detector and no other detection occurs along the rest of the pulse . in the following , we show how the single photon detection condition is satisfied with our simple detector - decoy method under current technology .",
    "the detector - decoy method , termed by moroder _",
    "et al _ @xcite to emphasize its connection and applicability in qkd , is outlined thus .",
    "suppose an initial phase randomized signal state ( written as a classical mixture of fock states ) of @xmath20 @xcite , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 being the photon number , passes through intensity modulator ( i m ) with a transmittance @xmath23 , and is detected by a threshold detector .",
    "the detection operation can be characterized by two operators , receiving no photons that results in no clicks @xmath24 , and receiving at least one photon giving exactly one click @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the unit operator .",
    "therefore , the probability of receiving no clicks is @xmath29=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-\\eta)^n p_{n}$ ] .",
    "notice that if we were to variate the transmittance @xmath30 , in principle , we would be able to obtain a sufficient set of linear functions to solve the unknown parameters , the photon probabilities @xmath31 , thereby attaining the received photon number statistics ,    @xmath32    in an actual setting , for the detector s imperfections , such as finite detection efficiency @xmath33 and a dark count probability @xmath34 , we modify the operator @xmath35 as @xmath36 , and @xmath37 will take the form of @xmath38 .",
    "following the ideal detector case , we can also vary the transmittance of the i m to obtain a set of linear functions to deduce the values of @xmath31 and thus gain the signal photon number statistics .      with the detector - decoy method",
    ", we obtain the signal photon number statistics required for the rrdps protocol key rate generation . in our simulation model ,",
    "we vary the transmittance of bob s detector three times , @xmath39 , specifically @xmath40 , so that the probabilities of receiving clicks can be written as @xmath41 with @xmath42 as the total dark count probability of each train and @xmath43 as the detector efficiency . here",
    ", we assume that events in which the signals received by bob that involve more than @xmath44 photons are highly improbable and thus ignored .",
    "next , we calculate a related value , the rate of detection @xmath45 can be directly measured experimentally . following methods of the decoy state qkd @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the efficiency of transmission related to the transmission distance @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the channel loss rate of the fiber .",
    "clearly , with each attenuation of @xmath51 , @xmath45 should equal the corresponding probability @xmath52 of receiving a click in the detector , and therefore this will be used as constraints in subsequent calculations . in the rrdps protocol ,",
    "bob only declares a detection event successful when single photons are registered by his pnr detector , and the multiphoton signals received are discarded .",
    "here , we consider a more realistic scenario , in which despite signals of multiphotons created by the source or the eavesdropper , throughout transmission and detection , only one photon from each multiphoton signal pulse survives for registration at the detector , while all other photons are lost , mathematically put as a minimum of a single photon transmission probability function , @xmath53 under the constraints that @xmath54 for @xmath47 , where the photon number probabilities @xmath55 satisfy @xmath56 and @xmath57 . meanwhile , in general qkd protocols , the length of secure key @xmath58 is obtained after subtracting the bits used for error reconciliation and privacy amplification @xcite , written as @xmath59 $ ] , where @xmath60 is the length of the sifted key , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the costs for error reconciliation and privacy amplification , respectively , and @xmath63 is the parameter related to the efficiency of the employed error correction code . in standard calculations , it holds that @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the shannon entropy @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the bit error rate and phase error rate . in our computations",
    ", we inspect specifically the key rate per pulse , with its formula written as @xcite @xmath70\\big ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the overall gain , @xmath72 is the lower bound of eq . ,",
    "and @xmath73 is a constant associated with the probability of finding more than @xmath74 photons in each pulse , written as @xcite @xmath75 as we can see , the second and third terms in eq .",
    "are the error correction and privacy amplification terms , respectively .",
    "in our simulation , the exact forms of @xmath71 and @xmath76 in eq . can be given by @xcite @xmath77/q , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 as the system error probability , and the rrdps - qkd experimental parameters @xcite used are listed in table i.    .key parameters for simulation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     considering the worst case of the lower bound of @xmath79 , where only one photon from each pulse of multiphoton signals survives transmission for registration at the detector , we optimize parameters @xmath10 , the average photon number of each train , and @xmath74 , the threshold photon number via a local search algorithm @xcite to obtain the optimal key rate per pulse @xmath80 as a function of transmission distance . the results are shown as the solid lines in fig.[f2 ] , for @xmath81 and @xmath82 , from which we can see , our dd - rrdps - qkd is an experimentally realizable protocol with desirable performance .",
    "we also give the full parameter optimized results of the recent implementation of rrdps also using threshold detectors with a passive delay change @xcite with the same simulation experimental parameters as our model ( shown as the dashed lines in fig.[f2 ] ) for comparison , where the key rate per pulse function @xmath83 is given as eq.(2 ) of ref.@xcite @xmath84\\big ) .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as one can see , our results offer significant improvement in both key rate and transmission distance for a given pulse number @xmath2 compared with the methods proposed in @xcite .",
    "moreover , when @xmath2 becomes fewer , the advantages of our method become more prominent , as it offers more than one order of magnitude higher key rate per pulse at shorter distances to over two orders of magnitude higher key rate per pulse for longer distances , and greater performance distance of almost more than 50 km compared to @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we give a comparison between our dd - rrdps with conventional decoy - state bb84 @xcite , shown in fig.[f3 ] .",
    "as one can see , when @xmath78 is small , the decoy - state bb84 outperforms the rrdps , while as @xmath78 becomes larger , the advantages of rrdps becomes more prominent .",
    "this can be explained by that while @xmath78 is small , @xmath42 plays a significant role in qber , and since rrdps encodes only one bit on @xmath2 pulses , the total detector dark count probability magnifies greatly and the average photon number per pulse decreases significantly , therefore limiting its transmission distance and secret key rate , whereas bb84 encodes one bit per pulse .",
    "however , when @xmath78 becomes very large , it will cost a very large portion of the key for privacy amplification in the bb84-qkd protocol , while for rrdps - qkd , because of its high tolerance of errors , privacy amplification has nothing to do with the bit error rate .",
    "therefore , the rrdps greatly surpasses decoy - state bb84 given that the bit error rate is very large .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed a dd - rrdps - qkd protocol that by using a threshold detector and a variable attenuator , a practical experimental implementation of rrdps with desirable key rate and transmission distance has been achieved . with our simulation results , we have given the bounds to the fraction of detected events by bob from single photons and proved our work to be an experimentally realizable rrdps protocol with better performance , even in the worst scenario of only one photon from the entire weak signal of multiphoton pulses is detected by the detector , and have shown that the results obtained in our protocol greatly surpasses recent works .",
    "thus , an immediately feasible experimental solution of the rrdps - qkd protocol under current technology is offered requiring only threshold single - photon detectors .",
