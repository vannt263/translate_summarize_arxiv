    "when a phase transition is first order the formation of a new phase is an activated process @xcite .",
    "a nucleus of the new phase must form , and overcome a free - energy barrier before it can grow into a new phase .",
    "the rate at which nuclei overcome a barrier of height @xmath0 scales as @xmath1 and so this rate is very sensitive to the barrier height @xcite . for definiteness consider a first - order phase transition at a temperature @xmath2 in which the low temperature phase is the ordered phase , and the high temperature phase is the disordered phase .",
    "if we cool the disordered phase below @xmath2 but the barrier to nucleation of the ordered phase is very high then the rate at which nuclei of the ordered phase form will be effectively zero and the ordered phase will not form even though its free energy is lower than that of the disordered phase .",
    "the disordered phase will persist ; it is said to be metastable . here",
    "we calculate @xmath0 for nucleation near a second , continuous , transition , which we call transition @xmath3 .",
    "continuous transitions are critical points and so exhibit universal and beautiful behaviour , the thermodynamic and correlation functions contain power law terms with exponents which depend only on dimensionality and the symmetry of the order parameter @xcite . a priori",
    ", we might expect that @xmath0 might also contain a power law term with an exponent which depends only on dimensionality and the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "this would allow us to make predictions about how @xmath0 varied near a critical point which would apply to a whole class of systems .",
    "below , we present the results of calculations within mean - field theory , for an ising - like continuous transition in three dimensions .",
    "we determine the singular power law part of the free energy barrier @xmath0 : just above @xmath4 , it varies as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the correlation length associated with the order parameter of transition @xmath3 .",
    "this singular part means that the derivative of @xmath0 with respect to temperature diverges as the critical point is approached : the barrier to nucleation drops rapidly just above the transition .",
    "this agrees with the pioneering simulations of ten wolde and frenkel @xcite who found an anomalously low @xmath0 near the critical point of a metastable fluid - fluid transition .",
    "as far as the author is aware , nucleation near a critical point has only been considered for a fluid - fluid critical point within a strongly first - order fluid - crystal transition .",
    "this work was inspired by the observation that globular proteins often crystallise at temperatures close to where we might expect a metastable fluid - fluid critical point @xcite , and that the phase diagrams of some globular proteins do possess a metastable fluid - fluid transition @xcite .",
    "but as the effect we will examine is due to the decreasing free energy cost of fluctuations near a critical point it is universal , i.e. , applies to any other system in the same universality class , that of the three - dimensional ising model .",
    "indeed , it is easy to show that it also applies to systems in the universality classes of the ising model in other dimensionalities @xcite .",
    "@xcite and references therein for recent work",
    ".    the next section briefly sets out the standard landau theory for a continuous transition with a scalar order parameter .",
    "section iii then calculates the free energy of a nucleus within a simple mean - field theory of the square - gradient type .",
    "derivatives with respect to temperature and external field are also found .",
    "the final section is a conclusion .",

    "we have a system , which at equilibrium has one phase transition : a strongly first order transition , transition @xmath7 , which is at a temperature @xmath2 . for definiteness",
    "we let the high - temperature phase be the disordered phase and the low - temperature phase be the ordered phase .",
    "if we consider a very pure sample @xcite then we can supercool down to temperatures below @xmath2 to obtain metastable states @xcite , i.e. , the disordered phase is stable for long ( with respect to the relaxation time of the system ) periods of time over some temperature range just below @xmath2 . it is stable because the formation of the ordered phase is an activated process , the ordered phase must nucleate , overcoming some free energy barrier @xmath0 which will be a strong function of temperature and which diverges as @xmath8 . here , we are interested in how @xmath0 behaves if as we cool down in the metastable disordered phase , we approach a continuous transition , transition @xmath3 , at some temperature @xmath9 .",
    "we will assume that the nucleation barrier to transition @xmath7 is so large that it is possible to start from some temperature @xmath10 and slowly cool down past @xmath2 either to and below @xmath4 , or at least to a temperature only a little above @xmath4 , without transition @xmath7 occurring .",
    "if it is possible to cool slowly down to @xmath4 , then transition @xmath3 is said to be metastable @xcite : it is observable .",
    "if it is not possible to cool slowly down to @xmath4 without transition @xmath7 occurring then clearly transition @xmath3 is not observable ; it is unstable not metastable with respect to transition @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we will be studying nucleation of the low temperature phase of transition @xmath7 as @xmath4 is approached from above and so we will not only be determining the effect of transition @xmath3 on @xmath7 but also looking at whether or not @xmath3 is observable . roughly speaking ,",
    "if the proximity of a transition @xmath3 acts to strongly enhance the nucleation rate of transition @xmath7 , then this nucleation rate may become large thus rendering transition @xmath3 unobservable .",
    "we should also mention that we are using temperature as our variable simply for definiteness , we could replace it by another field variable , e.g. , pressure , without changing our conclusions .",
    "so , starting from high temperature and cooling down below @xmath2 we can approach @xmath4 .",
    "the order parameter of transition @xmath3 is denoted by @xmath11 and it may or may not be related to that of transition @xmath7 . the external field which couples to @xmath11 is @xmath12",
    ". the theory here will be mean - field in nature but rather general .",
    "we only have to assume that the nucleus of the ordered phase of transition @xmath7 has a core which has properties close to that of the bulk ordered phase ( c.f . , the assumptions which underly classical nucleation theory @xcite ) and that this core couples to the order parameter of transition @xmath3 . by coupling to @xmath11 we mean that if there is a nucleus at the origin , then the local value of @xmath11 , @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the distance from the centre of the nucleus .",
    "both assumptions are very reasonable : for a strongly first - order phase transition it is difficult to imagine a situation where the nucleus does not have a core with near bulk properties , and the core of the nucleus must perturb its surroundings and so , in the absence of special symmetries , will locally perturb the order parameter of transition @xmath3 .",
    "figure [ figschem ] is a schematic of the nucleus .",
    "near @xmath4 we use a landau theory for the transition @xmath3 .",
    "the landau theory of a continuous transition is simple , it is a textbook problem , see for example chaikin and lubensky s @xcite or kadanoff s @xcite .",
    "the bulk free energy per unit volume @xmath15 as a function of the order parameter @xmath11 is @xmath16 the transition is at @xmath4 at @xmath17 .",
    "we will only examine behaviour at @xmath17 but we retain @xmath12 in order to look at the response of the system to an external field which couples to @xmath11 .",
    "below , when we study the nucleus near transition @xmath3 , we will find that the outermost part of the density profile of the nucleus is controlled by the response function of @xmath11 , @xmath18 , defined by @xmath19 which is , using eq .",
    "( [ landau ] ) , @xmath20",
    "we split the nucleus into two parts : the core and the fringe .",
    "the core is that part of the nucleus less than @xmath21 from its centre and the fringe is that part farther away than @xmath21 .",
    "the fringe of the nucleus is assumed to be spherically symmetric .",
    "the core of the nucleus contains at its centre a volume which is close to the bulk ordered phase of transition @xmath7 .",
    "the fringe is essentially the region which surrounds this core and is perturbed by the core .",
    "its radius is therefore the correlation length @xmath6 of @xmath11 and so diverges as @xmath4 is approached .",
    "as we are concentrating on universal aspects of the nucleus and of @xmath0 we will replace the core by a boundary condition on @xmath22 in the fringe .",
    "we set @xmath23 which is taken to be independent of temperature and of @xmath12 .",
    "also , @xmath24 , which is just the obvious boundary condition that @xmath11 must tend towards its bulk value far from the nucleus .",
    "note that as we are above the transition and are working at zero field , @xmath25 but we will retain an explicit @xmath11 dependence in order to be able to take derivatives of @xmath0 . in the fringe and near @xmath4 , we need only consider the order parameter for transition @xmath3 and the variations in @xmath22 will not be large .",
    "therefore , we employ a standard landau - ginsburg or square - gradient functional for the excess free energy @xmath26 of an inhomogeneity in an otherwise homogeneous phase , @xcite @xmath27 { \\rm d}{\\bf r } , \\label{cahn}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the bulk free energy change per unit volume to go from @xmath11 to @xmath22 .",
    "the excess free energy @xmath26 is the free energy with a nucleus minus that without a nucleus ; @xmath29 is the contribution of the core . the second term within the brackets of eq .",
    "( [ cahn ] ) is a gradient term : the free energy cost due to variations in space of @xmath22 .",
    "it is proportional to the gradient squared which is the lowest order term in a gradient expansion and so is only adequate when @xmath11 is slowly varying .",
    "the coefficient , @xmath30 , of this term is taken to be a constant .",
    "the total excess of @xmath11 due to a nucleus is equal to the integrated value of @xmath31 .",
    "defining @xmath32 , then the integral over all space of this function gives the total excess of the order parameter due to the nucleus , @xmath33    the free energy barrier @xmath0 is the value of @xmath26 for the nucleus when it is at its maximum , at the top of the barrier .",
    "the nucleus at the top of the barrier is called the critical nucleus @xcite . for the critical nucleus we may set the functional derivative of @xmath26 with respect to the profile @xmath34 to zero , @xmath35 once we have solved eq .",
    "( [ max ] ) we can insert the solution into eq .",
    "( [ cahn ] ) to obtain the excess free energy of the critical nucleus , @xmath36 .",
    "the fringe is the outermost part of the nucleus , where @xmath22 is near the bulk value @xmath11 .",
    "so we can use a taylor expansion about @xmath37 for @xmath38 , @xmath39 because both @xmath38 and its first derivative are zero for @xmath37 , and the second derivative is @xmath40 [ eq . ( [ chidef ] ) ] . substituting eq .",

    "( [ ncrita ] ) for @xmath67 we see that although the core can only contribute a finite amount to @xmath67 as its volume is finite , the contribution of the fringe diverges as transition @xmath3 is approached .",

    "@xcite the critical point is that of a fluid - fluid or vapour - liquid  like transition .",
    "we have considered the effect of a continuous transition , transition @xmath3 , on the homogeneous nucleation of a new phase at a first - order transition , transition @xmath7 .",
    "we found that the temperature derivative of the free energy barrier to nucleation , @xmath0 , diverged as @xmath68 within our mean - field theory , and that the size of the critical nucleus , the nucleus at the top of the free energy barrier to nucleation , diverged as the response function @xmath69 .",
    "the presence of a critical point makes the nucleus very large , its diameter is the correlation length @xmath6 , and causes the free energy barrier to nucleation to decrease rapidly with decreasing temperature .",
    "it reduces the barrier and so facilitates nucleation .",
    "this is just what was first demonstrated by ten wolde and frenkel @xcite for nucleation of a crystalline phase near the critical point of a fluid - fluid transition .",
    "it is a rather general phenomenon and applies to any continuous transition with a scalar order parameter , i.e. , any ising - like transition . whether or not the same effect appears near a continuous transition in a system which is anisotropic or in which the order parameter is not a simple scalar , is an interesting open question .",
    "here we consider only homogeneous nucleation , nucleation in the bulk , far from any interface .",
    "heterogeneous nucleation , nucleation at an interface , either with a wall or an impurity , is in fact more common , and is not always an activated process .                                      note that conventionally ` critical ' is used to denote both a continuous transition and the crystallite at the top of the barrier although there is no connection between the two uses of the word .",
