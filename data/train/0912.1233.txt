    "the focusing nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) @xmath2 where  @xmath3 , and  @xmath4 is the laplacian , has been the subject of intense study , due to its role in various areas of physics , such as nonlinear optics and bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) .",
    "it is well - known that the nls   possesses solutions that become singular in a finite time  @xcite .",
    "of special interest is the critical  ( @xmath5 ) nls @xmath6 which models the collapse of intense laser beams that propagate in a bulk kerr medium .    in this study , we consider the focusing biharmonic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( bnls ) @xmath7 where  @xmath8 is the biharmonic operator .",

    "the critical bnls can be rewritten as @xmath14 correspondingly , the bnls with  @xmath15 is called subcritical , and the bnls with  @xmath16 is called supercritical .",
    "this is analogous to the nls , where the critical case is  @xmath17 .    in  @xcite",

    "the latter work also showed well - posedness for small data .",
    "the @xmath18-critical defocusing bnls was studied by miao , xu and zhao  @xcite and by pausader  @xcite .",
    "the above studies focused on non - singular solutions . in this work ,",
    "we study singular solutions of the bnls in  @xmath18 , i.e. , solutions that exist in  @xmath22 over some finite time interval  @xmath23 , but for which  @xmath24 the first study of singular bnls solutions was done by fibich , ilan and papanicolau  @xcite , who proved the following results :    [ thrm : ge_subcritical ] solutions of the subcritical ( @xmath15 ) focusing bnls   exist globally .",

    "the simulations in  @xcite suggested that there exist singular solutions for  @xmath12 and  @xmath16 , and that these singularities are of the blowup type , namely , the solution becomes infinitely localized .",
    "however , in contradistinction with nls theory , there is currently no rigorous proof that solutions of the bnls can become singular in either the critical or the supercritical case .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only work , apart from  @xcite , which considered singular solutions of the bnls is by chae , hong and lee  @xcite , who proved that if singular solutions of the critical bnls exist , then they have a power - concentration property .",
    "see section  [ ssec : power_conc ] for more details .",
    "in this work , we consider singular solutions of the focusing bnls in the @xmath18-subcritical regime  .",
    "our purpose is to characterize these singular solutions : their profile , blowup rate , power concentration , et cetera .    in some cases",
    ", we assume radial symmetry , i.e. , that  @xmath28 where @xmath29 in these cases , equation   reduces to @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the radial biharmonic operator . specifically , the critical bnls   reduces to @xmath32    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : invariance ] , we use noether theorem to derive conservation laws for the bnls .",
    "we recall that in the critical nls , the conservation law which follows from invariance of the action integral under dilation leads to the nls `` variance identity '' , which can be used to prove the existence of singular solutions . in section  [ ssec : varid ]",
    "we use a similar procedure to derive the `` variance identity '' for the critical bnls , and then generalize it to the supercritical bnls .",
    "however , since it is not clear that the `` bnls variance '' is positive definite , this identity does not lead to a proof of the existence of singular solutions .",
    "the ground states of the bnls standing - wave equation   were previously computed only in the one - dimensional case  @xcite , since they were computed using a shooting method , which can not be easily generalized to multi - dimensions . in section  [ sec :",
    "stationary ] we use the spectral renormalization method to compute the ground - states of the critical bnls   for one , two and three dimensions .",
    "the calculated ground - states provide the first numerical estimate of the critical power for collapse @xmath33 in the two - dimensional and three - dimensional cases , see section  [ sec : critical_power ] .",
    "direct simulations of the critical bnls suggest that the constant  @xmath34 in theorem  [ thrm : ge_critical ] is optimal .    in section  [ sec : rigorous ]",
    "we use rigorous analysis to study the critical bnls  .",
    "the blowup rate is shown to be lower - bounded by a quartic root , i.e. , @xmath35 the corresponding bound for the critical nls is a square root , i.e. , @xmath36 we then prove that singular solutions converge to a self - similar profile strongly in  @xmath37 , for any  @xmath19 in the @xmath18-subcritical regime  .",
    "this implies that the singular solutions have the power - concentration property , whereby the amount of power that enters the singularity point is at least  @xmath34 .",
    "these rigorous results mirror those of the critical nls .",
    "let us denote the location of the maximal amplitude of a radially - symmetric solution by @xmath38 singular solutions are called `` _ peak - type _ '' when @xmath39 for  @xmath40 , and `` _ ring - type _ '' when  @xmath41 for  @xmath42 . in this work ,",
    "we use asymptotic analysis and numerics to find and characterize peak - type singular solutions of the bnls equation .",
    "ring - type singular solutions of the bnls will be studied elsewhere  @xcite .    in section  [ sec : crit_peak ] we use asymptotics and numerics to show that peak - type singular solutions of the critical bnls collapse with the quasi self - similar profile @xmath43 where the self - similar profile is the ground state  @xmath44 . the blowup rate is shown to be slightly faster than the quartic - root bound .",
    "this is analogous to the critical nls , where the blowup rate of peak - type solutions is slightly faster than the square - root bound , due to the loglog correction ( the `` loglog law '' ) .",
    "it is an open question whether the correction to the bnls blowup rate is also a loglog term .    in section  [ sec : supercrit_peak ] we consider peak - type singular solutions of the supercritical bnls . in this case ,",
    "asymptotics and numerics show that singular solutions are of the quasi self - similar form @xmath45 the blowup rate of  @xmath46 is exactly a quartic - root , and the self - similar profile  @xmath47 is different from the ground - state .",
    "rather , as in the supercritical nls , the self - similar profile  @xmath48 is the zero - hamiltonian solution of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem .",
    "although @xmath47 is not in  @xmath0 , it can be the self - similar profile of a collapsing  @xmath18 solution , since the collapsing solution is `` only '' quasi self - similar .",
    "section  [ sec : num_meth ] presents the numerical methods .",
    "the computations of singular bnls solutions that focus by factors of  @xmath1 and more , necessitated the usage of adaptive grids .",
    "we develop a modified version of the static grid redistribution method  @xcite , which is more convenient for the biharmonic problem . calculating the bnls standing waves in multi - dimensions",
    "is done using the spectral renormalization method .      in this study , we use rigorous theory , asymptotic theory and numerics to analyze singular solutions of the bnls .",
    "all the results presented in this work mirror those of the nls , `` up to a change by a factor of  @xmath49 '' in the blowup rate  ( @xmath50 ) , in the critical value of  @xmath19 ( @xmath51 ) , et cetera .",
    "however , several key features of nls theory are still missing from bnls theory .",
    "first , the `` variance identity '' for the bnls can not be used to prove that singular solutions exist .",
    "second , the critical nls is invariant under the pseudo - conformal ( `` lens - transformation '' ) symmetry which can also be used to construct explicit singular solutions . at this time",
    ", it is unknown whether an analogous identity for the critical bnls exists .",
    "third , in critical nls theory , the self - similar profile is known to possess a quadratic radial phase term , i.e. , @xmath52 this term represents the focusing of the solution towards  @xmath53 , and plays a key role in the rigorous and asymptotic theory of the critical nls .",
    "at this time , we do not know the analogous radial phase term for the critical bnls .",
    "finally , we note that a similar `` up to a factor of  @xmath49 '' connection exists between singular solutions of the nonlinear heat equation , see  @xcite , and the biharmonic nonlinear heat equation , see  @xcite .",
    "for example , the  @xmath54 norm of singular solutions blows up as  @xmath55 for the nonlinear heat equation , and as  @xmath56 for the biharmonic heat equation .",
    "the `` similarity up to a factor of  @xmath49 '' , however , is not perfect .",
    "for example , the self - similar spatial variable is  @xmath57 for the nonlinear heat equation , and  @xmath58 { { { t_{\\rm c}}}-t } $ ] for the biharmonic nonlinear heat equation .",
    "another difference between the equations is that singular solutions are _ asymptotically _ self - similar for the nonlinear heat equation , and truly self - similar for the biharmonic heat equation .",
    "in contrast , the nls possesses self - similar singular solutions , whereas for the bnls it is unknown whether singular solutions are truly , or only asymptotically , self - similar .",
    "the bnls   is the euler - lagrange equation of the action integral @xmath59 where  @xmath60 is the lagrangian density @xmath61 therefore , the conserved quantities of the bnls can be found using noether theorem , see appendix  [ app : noether ] . as in the standard nls ,",
    "invariance of the action integral under phase - multiplications  @xmath62 implies conservation of the `` power '' (  @xmath0 norm ) , i.e , .",
    "@xmath63 similarly , invariance under temporal translations  @xmath64 implies conservation of the hamiltonian @xmath65   =            { \\left\\vert{\\delta\\psi}\\right\\vert}_2 ^ 2               -\\frac{1}{\\sigma+1 } { \\left\\vert{\\psi}\\right\\vert}_{2(\\sigma+1)}^{2(\\sigma+1)},\\ ] ] and invariance under spatial translations  @xmath66 implies conservation of the linear momentum , i.e. , @xmath67 in the critical case  @xmath68 , the action integral is also invariant under the dilation transformation  @xmath69 the corresponding conserved quantity is @xmath70      we recall that the action integral of the critical nls   is invariant under the dilation transformation @xmath71 the corresponding conserved quantity is @xmath72 in addition , the integral term  @xmath73 is the time - derivative of the variance , i.e. , @xmath74 therefore , it follows that @xmath75 in the supercritical nls , the second derivative of the variance is not related to this conservation law .",
    "nevertheless , direct differentiation shows that @xmath76 therefore @xmath77 since  @xmath78 , the variance identity   shows that solutions of the critical and supercritical nls , whose hamiltonian is negative , become singular in a finite time  @xcite .",
    "we next extend the analogy between   and   to the non - critical case . in the case of the bnls",
    ", direct differentiation shows that @xmath79 therefore , if we define @xmath80 where  @xmath81 is a positive constant , we get the bnls variance identity @xmath82 in order to use this identity to prove singularity formation , however , one must show that  @xmath83 , as defined by  , has to remain positive .",
    "direct integration by parts gives that @xmath84 while the second term on the rhs is a temporal derivative of a positive - definite quantity , the first term on the rhs is not .",
    "therefore , it remains an open question whether  @xmath83 has to be positive .",
    "the bnls equation   admits the standing - wave solutions  @xmath85 the equation for the standing - wave profile is @xmath86 where  @xmath87 . for example , in one dimension , equation   is given by @xmath88 and in two dimensions by @xmath89    [ eqs : radial_stationary_state ] if we impose radial symmetry , eq .",
    "reduces to @xmath90 where  @xmath91 is given in  . at  @xmath53 ,",
    "all the odd derivatives vanish , and so the solution of   is subject to the boundary conditions @xmath92    the solution of eq .",
    "was computed numerically in the one - dimensional case in  @xcite as follows . in the  @xmath93 case ,",
    "can be integrated once , yielding an explicit relation between  @xmath94 and  @xmath95 .",
    "this parameter - reduction enables the usage of a one - parameter shooting approach .",
    "unfortunately , such a parameter reduction is not possible in higher dimensions .",
    "therefore , in multi - dimensions we compute the ground - states using the spectral renormalization method ( srm ) , which was introduced by petviashvili in  @xcite , and more recently by albowitz and musslimani in  @xcite .",
    "see section  [ ssec : srm ] for further details .    in figure",
    "[ fig : srm ] we display the results in the critical case , i.e. , the ground states of @xmath96 figure  [ fig : srm_1d ] displays the ground - state of eq .   in the critical  @xmath93 case , as calculated by the srm .",
    "the solution is in excellent agreement with the solution computed in  @xcite using the shooting method .",
    "figure  [ fig : srm_2d ] and figure  [ fig : srm_3d ] display the ground state in the critical  @xmath97 and  @xmath98 cases .",
    "we note that , while the srm method that we use does not enforce radial symmetry , the calculated ground states for  @xmath99 and  @xmath100 are radially symmetric ( data not shown ) .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , the ground - states of the bnls are non - monotonic in  @xmath101 and change their sign , in contradistinction with the ground - states of the nls which are monotonically - decreasing and strictly positive .",

    "the computation of  @xmath10 , see section  [ sec : stationary ] , allows for the numerical calculation of the critical power  @xmath34 .",

    "there is no proof that solutions of the bnls can become singular .",

    "hence , we will explore this issue numerically .",
    "we recall that in the critical nls , the necessary condition for collapse @xmath110 is sharp , since for any  @xmath107 the initial condition  @xmath111 becomes singular in a finite time  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we now check numerically whether for  @xmath112 , the solution of the critical bnls with the initial condition @xmath113 becomes singular . to do this",
    ", we solve the one - dimensional and two - dimensional critical bnls equations with the initial condition  @xmath114 , see fig  [ fig : peak_ric ] . in both cases",
    ", the solution appears to blow up , suggesting that theorem  [ thrm : ge_critical ] is sharp .",
    "see section  [ ssec : sgr ] for the numerical methodology used for solving the bnls .",
    "we also note that in the critical nls , if the initial condition is different from the ground state , the power input required for collapse is strictly larger than  @xmath115 , see  @xcite .",
    "this the case also in the bnls .",
    "for example , in the one - dimensional critical bnls with a gaussian shaped initial condition  @xmath116 , the input power required for collapse is strictly larger than  @xmath117 , see  @xcite . in the two - dimensional critical bnls with",
    "a gaussian shaped initial condition , the input power required is strictly larger than  @xmath118 , see  @xcite .",
    "in  @xcite , cazanave and weissler proved that the blowup rate for singular solutions of the critical nls   is not slower than a square - root , i.e. , that  @xmath119 . the analogous result for",
