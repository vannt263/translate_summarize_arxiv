    "lorentz invariance ( li ) is a corner - stone of the two accepted field theoretical descriptions of nature ; the standard model ( sm ) of strong and electro - weak interactions and general relativity ( gr ) . furthermore , lorentz symmetry is closely linked with charge conjugation , parity , and time reversal symmetry ( cpt symmetry ) via the cpt theorem : any lorentz invariant field theory must be cpt invariant  @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that in any field theory if cpt symmetry is violated lorentz symmetry must also be violated  @xcite .",
    "thus a test of li is a test of cpt invariance and any violation would imply new physics .",
    "it is commonly regarded that both sm and gr are low - energy limits of a more fundamental theory that consistently merges the two at the plank - scale .",
    "it is well known that many of the contenders for this more fundamental theory allow for small spontaneous violations of lorentz symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the experimental search for lorentz symmetry violations is thus a search for evidence of planck - scale physics  @xcite .",
    "the close link between cpt symmetry and lorentz symmetry provides additional motivations to search for their violations .",
    "this is because the breakdown of cpt symmetry along with baryon number violation , could be the source of the baryon asymmetry of the universe . unlike scenarios involving only cp violation , baryogenesis based on cpt violation",
    "does not require the breakdown of thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "moreover , observations that the expansion of the universe is accelerating  @xcite have led to the idea that the universe is dominated by dark energy , suggesting that a new field permeates all space  @xcite .",
    "an interaction of this field with matter would manifest itself as an apparent breaking of lorentz symmetry  @xcite , and searches for lorentz symmetry violation can constrain these cosmological models .    at currently attainable energies ,",
    "small violations of lorentz symmetry can be described by an effective field theory known as the standard model extension ( sme )  @xcite .",
    "the sme is the usual lorentz invariant standard model plus all possible lorentz symmetry violating terms that can be formed with the known fields of the sm and gravity coupled to constant or slowly varying background fields , such that the lagrangian remains lorentz invariant  @xcite .",
    "the sme provides a basis for analyzing experiments that search for lorentz symmetry violation in a wide range of physical systems  @xcite . in the sme framework",
    ", spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking would result in a background fields which permeates the universe .",
    "this background field will change its direction over the course of a day due to the earth s rotation , enabling experiments to detect the lorentz symmetry violation  @xcite .",
    "li implies that the velocity of light in vacuum , @xmath4 , is independent of the energy @xmath5 of the photon .",
    "therefore , tests of isotropy and constancy of the speed of light in vacuum are tests of li .",
    "such tests were critical in the conception and early experimental verification of li  @xcite .",
    "any hypothetical energy dependence of @xmath4 is constrained by the current limit on the photon mass ( @xmath6 10@xmath7 ev  @xcite ) as @xmath8 10@xmath9 ev@xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the velocity of a mass - less photon in vacuum .",
    "however , the aforementioned lorentz symmetry breaking background field can influence the propagation of light  @xcite . in order to distinguish between effects of photon mass and vacuum properties",
    "it is more convenient to use vacuum refractive index , @xmath12 .    in an environment",
    "where gravity can be neglected , lorentz violation can be described by the qed limit to the flat - spacetime minimal standard model extension ( msme )  @xcite . in the msme framework",
    "the photon s dispersion relation is modified as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 denotes the photon s four - momentum along the @xmath15 direction , and the three - vector @xmath16 is the preferred direction that breaks the lorentz symmetry .",
    "this dispersion relation implies that the photon energy @xmath5 depends on the direction of the photon ( @xmath15 )",
    ". a violation of lorentz symmetry then generates a direction dependent vacuum refractive index , @xmath17 . in the msme framework ,",
    "anisotropies in the speed of light are bounded by three components of the coefficient @xmath18  @xcite which are then related to the components of @xmath16 . in this work we used electron - photon scattering ( compton scattering ) to study the energy dependence and the anisotropy of the vacuum refractive index . in a terrestrial laboratory the photon s three - momentum in a compton scattering process changes direction due to the earth s rotation , and thus any anisotropy in the vacuum dispersion would lead to sidereal variation in the kinematics of the scattering process .",
    "this work is similar to a measurement using compton scattering at the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) , but we use the compton asymmetry instead of the kinematic edge ( compton edge ) used in the esrf study  @xcite .",
    "this work represents the first use of compton scattering asymmetry to test lorentz invariance .",
    "polarimeters based on compton scattering are routinely used to continuously monitor the electron beam polarization at electron accelerators  @xcite .",
    "these polarimeters involve measuring a known qed double - spin asymmetry in electron scattering from a photon beam of known polarization .",
    "the scattering asymmetry varies with the fraction of electron beam energy transferred to the scattered photon , with the largest asymmetry occurring at the kinematic limit corresponding to the highest energy back - scattered photon .",
    "the compton - scattered electrons and photons can be independently measured and analyzed to determine the polarization of the electron beam .",
    "recently , the compton polarimeter at hall  c in jefferson lab ( jlab ) demonstrated sub-1% precision  @xcite .",
    "this high degree of precision of compton polarimeters allows precise measurement of the vacuum refractive index of the compton - scattered photon . by monitoring the sidereal variation of the vacuum refractive index",
    "we can also measure its isotropy .",

    "a parity - violating electron - scattering experiment in hall  c at jlab , known as the @xmath19experiment  @xcite , aims to test the standard model of particle physics by providing the first precision measurement of the weak vector charge of the proton . in order to meet the high - precision requirement of the @xmath19experiment",

    "the jlab hall  c compton polarimeter was designed to continuously monitor the beam polarization at high beam currents with better than 1% statistical uncertainty , per hour .",
    "it consists of four identical dipole magnets forming a magnetic chicane that displaces a 1.16  gev electron beam vertically downward by 57  cm . a high intensity ( @xmath20 1 - 3  kw ) beam of @xmath20 100% circularly polarized photons is provided by an external low - gain fabry - protlaser cavity which consists of a 85  cm long optical cavity with a gain between 100 and 300 coupled to a green ( 532  nm ) , continuous wave , 10 w laser ( coherent verdi ) . the laser light is focused at the interaction region ( @xmath21  90  @xmath22 m ) , and it is larger than the electron beam envelope ( @xmath23  40  @xmath22 m ) .    after interacting with the photon target",
    ", the electron beam was deflected back to the nominal beamline with a second pair of dipole magnets .",
    "the third chicane magnet bends the primary beam by 10.1@xmath24 , and also separates the compton scattered electrons from the primary beam by up to 17  mm at the electron detector , placed just before the fourth dipole ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the electron detector consisted of a set of four planes of diamond micro - strip detectors .",
    "the close proximity of the detectors to the primary beam allowed them to capture @xmath20 80% of the spectrum of scattered electrons .",
    "the compton electron spectrum is spread over 50 - 60 strips allowing a precise measurement of its shape .",
    "the data analysis technique exploited track finding , the high granularity of the electron detector and its large acceptance to fit the shape of the measured asymmetry spectrum to the precisely calculable compton asymmetry .",
    "the scattered photon had a maximum energy of approximately 46 mev , which was detected in a calorimeter consisting of a 2@xmath252 matrix of pbwo@xmath26 scintillating crystals attached to a single photo - multiplier tube .",
    "details on the compton polarimeter can be found in ref .",
    "the results discussed here are from the electron detector only and were collected during the period between november , 2011 and may , 2012 .",
    "the electron beam helicity was reversed at a rate of 960 hz in a pseudo - random sequence .",
    "the compton laser was operated in 90 second cycles ( 60  s switched on and 30  s switched off ) .",
    "the laser - off data were used to measure the background , which was subtracted from the laser - on yield for each electron helicity state .",
    "the measured asymmetry was built from these yields as described in ref .",
    "a statistical precision of @xmath27  1% per hour was routinely achieved .",
    "the electron beam polarization @xmath28 for a known photon polarization @xmath29 was extracted by fitting the measured asymmetry to the @xmath30 theoretical compton asymmetry ( @xmath31 ) for fully polarized electrons and photon beams in the @xmath32-th strip , using @xmath33 the electron polarization ( @xmath28 ) and the non - integer strip number corresponding to the maximum displaced electrons ( @xmath34 ) , i.e. the compton edge , were the only free parameters in these fits .",

    "if the speed of light was constant with respect to a parameter such as photon energy ( @xmath5 ) , the refractive index of vacuum ( @xmath44 ) is a constant equal to unity .",
    "the search for a deviation of the refractive index of vacuum from unity as a function photon energy or photon direction is then a search for violation of lorentz symmetry . for compton scattering of ultra - relativistic electrons in vacuum",

    "<S> we report on a measurement of the constancy and anisotropy of the speed of light relative to the electrons in photon - electron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we used the compton scattering asymmetry measured by the new compton polarimeter in hall  c at jefferson lab to test for deviations from unity of the vacuum refractive index ( @xmath0 ) . for photon energies in the range of 9 - 46 mev , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a new limit of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the absence of sidereal variation over the six month period of the measurement constrains any anisotropies in the speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> these constitute the first study of lorentz invariance using compton asymmetry . within the minimal standard model extension framework , our result yield limits on the photon and electron coefficients @xmath2 , and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> although , these limits are several orders of magnitude larger than the current best limits , they demonstrate the feasibility of using compton asymmetry for tests of lorentz invariance . </S>",
    "<S> future parity violating electron scattering experiments at jefferson lab will use higher energy electrons enabling better constraints . </S>"
