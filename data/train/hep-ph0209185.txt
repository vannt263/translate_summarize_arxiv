    "because the kobayashi - maskawa matrix element @xmath2 is very close to 1 the dominating decay mode of the top quark is into the channel @xmath3 .",
    "the helicity content of the @xmath0-boson ( transverse - plus , transverse - minus and longitudinal ) in this decay can be probed through a measurement of the shape of the lepton spectrum in the decay of the @xmath0-boson as was recently done by the cdf collaboration  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the size of the longitudinal contribution which encodes the physics of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "the transverse - plus contribution vanishes at the born term level .",
    "any significant deviation from this value would point to sizeable radiative corrections or a non - sm @xmath4 admixture in the weak @xmath5 current transition .    a first measurement of the helicity content of the @xmath0-boson was recently carried through by the cdf collaboration  @xcite .",
    "their result is @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the rates into the longitudinal polarization state of the @xmath0-boson and @xmath8 is the total rate .",
    "the cdf collaboration has also quoted a value for the transverse - plus contribution @xmath9 which was obtained by fixing the longitudinal contribution to its standard model ( sm ) value @xmath10 .",
    "they obtained @xmath11 the measured values of the two normalized partial helicity rates are well within sm expectations which , at the born term level , are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , the errors on this measurement are too large to allow for a significant test of the sm predictions .",
    "the errors will be much reduced when larger data samples become available in the future from tevatron run ii , and , at a later stage , from the lhc .",
    "optimistically the measurement errors can eventually be reduced to the @xmath14 level  @xcite .",
    "if such a level of accuracy can in fact be reached it is important to take into account the radiative and finite width corrections to the different helicity rates .",
    "the radiative corrections to the top width are rather large .",
    "relative to the @xmath15 born term rate they amount to @xmath16 ( qcd one - loop )   @xcite , @xmath17 ( electroweak one - loop )   @xcite and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) ( qcd two - loop ; approximate )  @xcite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath20 and finite width corrections reduce the born width by @xmath21  @xcite ( for @xmath22  @xcite ) and @xmath23  @xcite , respectively .",
    "given the fact that the radiative and finite width corrections to the total rate are sizeable it is important to know also the respective corrections to the partial longitudinal and transverse rates .",
    "the qcd one - loop corrections to the partial helicity rates were given in  @xcite .",
    "in this letter we provide the missing one - loop electroweak ( ew ) corrections and the finite width ( fw ) corrections to the partial helicity rates .",
    "note that to leading order the finite width correction is also a one - loop effect .    the angular decay distribution for the decay process @xmath24 followed by @xmath25 ( or by @xmath26 ) is given by ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 denote the partial rates into transverse - plus , transverse - minus and longitudinal @xmath0-bosons . integrating over @xmath31 one recovers the total rate @xmath32    one can also define a forward - backward asymmetry by considering the rate in the forward hemisphere @xmath33 and in the backward hemisphere @xmath34 .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath35 is then given by @xmath36    the angular decay distribution is described in cascade fashion , i.e.  the polar angle @xmath37 is measured in the @xmath0 rest frame where the lepton pair or the quark pair emerges back - to - back .",
    "the angle @xmath37 denotes the polar angle between the @xmath38 momentum direction and the antilepton @xmath39 ( or the antiquark @xmath40 ) . the various contributions in ( [ ang ] ) are reflected in the shape of the lepton energy spectrum in the rest frame of the top quark .",
    "from the angular factors in ( [ ang ] ) it is clear that the contribution of @xmath28 makes the lepton spectrum harder while @xmath29 softens the spectrum where the hardness or softness is gauged relative to the longitudinal contribution .",
    "the only surviving contribution in the forward direction @xmath41 comes from @xmath28 .",
    "the fact that @xmath28 is predicted to be quite small implies that the lepton spectrum will be soft .",
    "the cdf measurement of the helicity content of the @xmath38 in top decays was in fact done by fitting the values of the helicity rates to the shape of the lepton s energy spectrum .",
    "the born term contributions to the normalized helicity rates are given by @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the total born term rate and @xmath46 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "numerical values for the normalized helicity rates have been added in paranthesis using @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we begin with the electroweak one - loop corrections .",
    "they consist of the four tree diagram contributions shown in fig .  1 and the one - loop contributions which are too numerous to be depicted in this letter .",
    "in the feynmant hooft gauge one has to calculate 18 different massive one- loop three - point functions as well as the many massive one - loop two - point functions needed in the renormalization program .",
    "we have recalculated all one- loop contributions analytically and have checked them numerically with the help of a xloops / ginac package that automatically calculates one - loop three point functions @xcite .",

    "the normalized partial rates will be denoted by a hat .",
    "thus we write @xmath94 @xmath95 . for the transverse - minus and longitudinal rates we factor out the normalized partial born rates @xmath96 and write ( @xmath97 ) @xmath98 where @xmath99 . writing the result in this way",
    "helps to quickly assess the percentage changes brought about by the various corrections .        in the case of the transverse - plus rate the partial born term rate can not be factored out because of the fact that @xmath102 is zero . in this case",
    "we present our numerical result in the form @xmath103 @xmath104 note that the finite width correction is zero in this case .",
    "numerically the correction to @xmath105 occurs only at the pro mille level .",
    "it is save to say that , if top quark decays reveal a violation of the sm @xmath106 current structure that exceeds the @xmath107 level , the violations must have a non - sm origin . due to the fact that @xmath105 is so small the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath108",
    "is dominantly determined by @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we find @xmath108 = -0.2270 .    to conclude our numerical discussion we also list our numerical results for the electroweak corrections in the @xmath80scheme . in the notation of eqs.([rateminus],[ratel],[rateplus ] ) we obtain electroweak corrections of @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 which are @xmath114 larger than the corresponding corrections in the @xmath76scheme .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the top mass dependence of the ratio @xmath115 and @xmath116 . the born term and the corrected curves are practically straight line curves . since the electroweak and the finite width effects practically cancel the curves are very close to the qcd corrected curves presented in @xcite .",
    "the horizontal displacement of the respective curves is @xmath117 gev and @xmath118 gev for @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "one would thus make the corresponding mistakes in the top mass determination from a measurement of the angular structure functions if the born term curves were used instead of the corrected curves .",
    "if we take @xmath119 gev as central value a @xmath107 relative error on the structure function measurement would allow one to determine the top quark mass with @xmath120 3 gev and @xmath120 1.2 gev accuracy , depending on whether the angular measurement was done on the longitudinal ( @xmath121 ) or transverse - minus ( @xmath122 ) mode .",
    "latter result also holds true for the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath35 since the transverse - plus rate is negligible .    in summary",
    ", we have calculated the electroweak radiative and finite width corrections to the three diagonal structure functions that occur in the polar angle distribution of the decay @xmath123 .",
    "these will be relevant for a determination of the top quark mass .",
    "we have not taken into account possible effects coming from the finite width of the top quark .",
    "these should be smaller than those calculated here for the @xmath0 width because @xmath124 .",
    "also there can be qed and qcd cross - talk between the production and decay processes that could spoil the factorization - based angular decay pattern discussed in this paper .",
