    "channeling and blocking effects in crystals refer to the orientation dependence of charged ion penetration in crystals . in the `` channeling effect '' ions moving along symmetry axes and planes in a crystal , suffer a series of small - angle scatterings that maintain them in the open `` channels '' in between the rows or planes of lattice atoms and thus penetrate much further into the crystal than in other directions and give all their energy into electrons .",
    "channeled incident ions do not get close to lattice sites , where they would be deflected at large angles . the  blocking effect \" consists in a reduction of the flux of ions originating in lattice sites along symmetry axes and planes , due to large - angle scattering with the atoms immediately in front of the originating lattice site .    in the context of direct dark matter detection",
    "channeling occurs when the nucleus that recoils after being hit by a wimp ( weakly interacting massive particle ) moves off in a direction close to a symmetry axis or symmetry plane of the crystal .",
    "non - channeled ions loose most of their energy into lattice atoms with which they collide . thus channeled ions produce more scintillation and ionization than they would produce otherwise , since they give all their energy to electrons .",
    "ion channeling in crystals has recently received a large amount of attention in the interpretation of direct dark matter detection data .",
    "the potential importance of this effect was first pointed out for nai ( tl ) by drobyshevski  @xcite and then by the dama  @xcite collaboration , which estimated the fraction of channeled recoils to be very large , close to 1 , for low recoiling energies in the kev range .",
    "this estimate of the channeling effect leads to considerable shifts in the cross section versus mass regions of acceptable wimp models in agreement with the dama / libra  @xcite annual modulation data towards lower wimp masses . as a consequence",
    ", the comparison between the dama results and the null results of other experiments was affected too ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that the blocking effect , not taken into account in the dama evaluation , is important and thus the fraction of recoiling ions that are channeled is smaller than in the dama collaboration estimate .",
    "the nuclei ejected from their lattice sites by wimp collisions are initially part of a crystal row or plane , thus , as argued originally by lindhard  @xcite ( through what he called the `` rule of reversibility '' ) , in a perfect lattice and in the absence of energy - loss processes , the probability that a particle starting from a lattice site is channeled would be zero .",
    "however , any departure of the actual lattice from a perfect lattice , e.g. due to vibrations of the lattice atoms which are always present , violates the conditions of this argument and allows for some of the recoiling lattice nuclei to be channeled . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed that the channeling fractions for nai ( tl ) crystals would never be larger than a few percent .",
    "this implies that channeling does not change the regions in cross section versus mass of acceptable wimp models in agreement with the dama / libra annual modulation data at less than @xmath0  @xcite .    channeling in dark matter direct detection might in principle",
    "also lead to a new background free dark matter signature .",
    "this was pointed out initially in 2008 and later in 2010 , by avignone , creswick , and nussinov  @xcite who suggested that a new type of daily modulation due to channeling could occur in nai ( and other ) crystals measuring ionization or scintillation .",
    "such a modulation of the rate due to channeling is expected to occur at some level because the `` wimp wind '' arrives to earth on average from a particular direction fixed to the galaxy .",
    "thus , earth s daily rotation changes the direction of the wimp wind with respect to the crystal axes and planes , changing the amount of recoiling ions that are channeled vs non - channeled , and therefore the amount of energy visible via scintillation or ionization .",
    "if this daily modulation could be measured , it would be a signature of dark matter without background since no other effect could depend on the orientation of the detector with respect to the wimp wind .",
    "following this idea , in ref .",
    "@xcite we provided a full computation of the effect and using our estimates of the channeling fractions in nai obtained upper bounds to the expected amplitude of daily modulation due to channeling in nai crystals .",
    "we found large daily modulation amplitudes of the signal rate , even of the order of 10% for some wimp candidates .",
    "however , even the largest amplitudes would not be observable in the 13 years of combined dama / nai and dama / libra  @xcite data because of their large background . in the hope that the daily modulation due to channeling could be observable in future dark matter experiments , we have provided estimates of the channeling fractions of recoiling ions also in ge , si  @xcite , and csi  @xcite crystals , and in the present paper we study noble gas crystals .",
    "the level of background in future experiments is a crucial element to determine if the daily modulation is observable and the advantage of using solidified noble gas detectors is the possibility of achieving a low background level for wimp searches  @xcite .",
    "xenon and neon have no long life radioisotopes and thus contain no intrinsic background source of radiation .",
    "argon has the drawback that it contains @xmath1 beta source which induces electron recoil signature in the detector .",
    "solid or crystallized xenon detector can be ideal for dark matter searches , whereas a crystallized xenon detector would be necessary to have channeling . at present ,",
    "solid xe crystals are used by the solid xenon r&d project  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compute the geometric channeling fractions of recoiling ions in solid xe , ar , and ne crystals . here",
    "`` geometric channeling fraction '' refers to assuming that the distribution of recoil directions is isotropic . in reality , in a dark matter direct detection experiment , the distribution of recoil directions is expected to be peaked in the direction of the average wimp flow . at room temperature and pressure xe , ar and ne are noble gases . at temperatures below 161.45 k ,",
    "83.80 k and 24.56 k respectively ( at room pressure ) they become solids .",
    "all of them form monatomic face - centered cubic ( f.c.c . ) crystals ( see appendix a ) .    our calculation is based on the classical analytic models developed in the 1960 s and 70 s , in particular by lindhard and collaborators  @xcite . in these models",
    "the discrete series of binary collisions of the propagating ion with atoms is replaced by interactions between the ion and uniformly charged strings or planes .",
    "the screened atomic thomas - fermi potential is averaged over a direction parallel to a row or a plane of lattice atoms .",
    "this averaged potential is considered to be uniformly smeared along the row or plane of atoms , respectively , which is a good approximation if the propagating ion interacts with many lattice atoms in the row or plane by a correlated series of many consecutive glancing collisions with lattice atoms .",

    "the furthest position from a string or plane of atoms is the middle of the channel ( whose width we call @xmath46 for an axial channel and @xmath27 for a planar channel ) .",

    "however , the treatment of planar channels presents some complications .",
    "the breakdown of the continuum theory for a planar channel is more involved than for an axial channel because the atoms in the plane contributing to the scattering of the propagating ion are usually displaced laterally within the plane with respect to the ion s trajectory .",

    "the maximum reflects the shape of the single channeling fractions , which all have maxima .",
    "these happen because the critical distances decrease with the ion energy @xmath4 , which makes channeling more probable , while the critical angles also decrease with @xmath4 , which makes channeling less probable . at low",
    "@xmath4 the critical distance effect dominates , and at large @xmath4 the critical angle effect dominates . at the maximum of the channeling",
    "fraction the axial channels dominate , in particular the channels @xmath114 $ ] and @xmath115 $ ] ( as seen in fig  [ onechannel ] ) .",
    "the dip and the raise result from having multiple axial and planar channels contributing to the channeling fraction . at lower @xmath4 axial channels dominate and at higher @xmath4 planar channels dominate .",
    "the dip happens at the cross - over between both types of channels , when as the energy increases the contribution of axial channels dies out and that of planar channels is increasing .",
    "this increase causes the subsequent raise in the channeling fraction as the energy increases further .    as shown in figs .",
    "[ fracxe - difft ] ( a ) , [ fracar - difft ] ( a ) , and [ fracne - difft ] ( a ) , the channeling fractions are never larger than 1% for xe and ar and never larger than 2% for ne ( with @xmath111 ) .",
    "temperature effects computed with @xmath111 are in the low range of what is found in other materials and propagating ions . considering larger values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , the channeling fractions are smaller . figs .",
    "[ fracxe - difft ] ( b ) , [ fracar - difft ] ( b ) , and [ fracne - difft ] ( b ) show that with @xmath97 , the maximum channeling fraction for xe ions at 160 k , ar ions at 83 k , and ne ions at 23 k would be below 0.2% .",
    "however , since we do not know which are the correct values of the crucial parameters @xmath83 and @xmath84 for xe , ar , and ne , we could ask ourselves how the channeling fractions would change if the values of these parameters would be smaller than 1 ( although for other materials and propagating ions the values of these parameters were found to be between 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 can not be smaller than zero , thus figs .",
    "[ fracxe - difft ] ( c ) , [ fracar - difft ] ( c ) , and [ fracne - difft ] ( c ) show the upper bounds on the geometric channeling fraction , obtained by setting @xmath87 , namely by neglecting thermal vibrations of the lattice ( which make the channeling fractions smaller as @xmath78 increases ) but including the thermal vibrations of the nucleus that is going to recoil ( which make the channeling fraction larger as @xmath78 increases ) .",
    "although it is physically inconsistent to take only the temperature effects on the initial position but not on the lattice , we do it here because using @xmath87 , namely a static lattice , provides an upper bound on the channeling probability with respect to that obtained using any other non - zero value of @xmath83 or @xmath84 . even in this case",
    ", the channeling fractions can not be larger than 5% .",
    "the critical angles depend on the temperature through the minimum distances of approach : as these increase with increasing temperatures , the critical angles decrease , what makes the channeling fraction smaller .",
    "however , there is a second temperature effect which makes the channeling fractions larger as the temperature increases : the vibrations of the atom which collides with the dark matter particle .",
    "depending on which of the two competing effects is dominant , the channeling fraction may either increase or decrease as the temperature increases .",
    "increasing the temperature of a crystal usually increases the fraction of channeled recoiling ions , but when the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 are large ( i.e. close to 2 ) so the critical distances increase rapidly with the temperature , the opposite may happen ( see fig .",
    "[ fracar - difft ] ( b ) ) .    to conclude ,",
    "let us remark that the analytical approach used here can successfully describe qualitative features of the channeling and blocking effects , but should be complemented by data fitting of parameters and by simulations to obtain a good quantitative description too .",
    "thus our results should in the last instance be checked by using some of the many sophisticated monte carlo simulation programs implementing the binary collision approach or mixed approaches .",
