    "we concluded that , if @xmath29 happens to be small enough , the only way to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy with neutrino oscillation experiments would be to probe @xmath34 and/or @xmath35 oscillations at very long baselines ( @xmath36  km ) and relatively small energies ( @xmath37  mev ) . given the enormous experimental challenges which one needs to overcome in order to achieve the conditions outlined in @xcite , it is of the utmost importance to explore other probes of the neutrino mass hierarchy .    here , we study non - oscillation probes of neutrino masses and mixing , and determine their capabilities for extracting the neutrino mass hierarchy .",

    "the only evidence for neutrino masses comes from long - baseline , neutrino oscillation experiments .",

    "it is always amusing to remember that solar neutrino experiments are sensitive to @xmath39  ev@xmath40 . ] on the other hand , neutrino oscillations are impotent when it comes to determining the neutrino masses themselves  they are only sensitive to the differences among the various neutrino masses .",
    "of course , several other phenomena are also potentially sensitive to nonzero neutrino masses .",
    "we discuss three qualitatively distinct `` non - oscillation probes '' of nonzero neutrino masses , and explore their potential for determining the nature of the neutrino mass hierarchy under the assumption that it will not be revealed by future oscillation experiments .",
    "conservation of energy and momentum dictates that any physical process involving neutrino absorption , emission , or scattering is sensitive to the values of the neutrino masses . due to the smallness of neutrino masses",

    "similarly , we expect that the the solar parameters , @xmath18 and @xmath166 can be measured at the 5% level in , say , precise measurements of the low energy solar neutrino flux @xcite , improved reactor experiments boasting greater statistics and reduced systematic errors conducted at baselines at ( or near ) the first survival probability minimum @xcite , or with broadband long - baseline @xmath167 studies @xcite .",

    "we concentrate our exploration of the the parameter space to this region . if , on the other hand , the katrin experiment obtained statistically significant evidence that @xmath6 is nonzero ( say , @xmath175  ev ) we would be constrained to the quasi - degenerate neutrino mass scenario , in which it is virtually impossible to determine the mass hierarchy by precisely measuring @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( see fig .",

    "[ figure : run](middle ) ) , the situation is qualitatively the same : one will not be able to determine the mass hierarchy from non - oscillation probes of neutrino masses unless @xmath8 is measured to be large ( @xmath179  ev ) and @xmath9 is `` small '' ( @xmath180  ev ) , in which case only the inverted mass hierarchy provides a good fit to the data .",

    "furthermore , when the sensitivity of both probes reaches the 0.01  ev level , we fail to fit the data if @xmath183  ev and @xmath184  ev .",
    "if faced with such a scenario , we would be tempted to conclude that the neutrinos are dirac fermions .",

    "while we have discovered that neutrinos have mass , there are still qualitative aspects of the neutrino mass spectrum that remain unknown .",
    "we have been able to measure , with good precision , the ( absolute value of the ) two mass - squared differences , but know very little about the magnitude of the individual neutrino masses .",
    "we are also ignorant when it comes to the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "we do nt know if the neutrino masses are `` normal ordered ''  @xmath0  or whether the mass hierarchy is `` inverted ''  @xmath1 ( such that @xmath189 ) .",
    "the reason we have failed ( so far ) to discover the neutrino mass hierarchy via neutrino oscillations is that both @xmath5 and @xmath190 happen to be small .    next - generation ,",
    "long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments are poised to uncover the ordering of the neutrino masses , but they can only be successful if @xmath5 is large enough .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath5 is too small , it is quite challenging to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy via neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "other probes are necessary . here",
    "we have studied in detail whether combined information from future studies of neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath8 ) , tritium beta - decay ( @xmath6 ) and cosmological probes of the energy composition of the universe ( @xmath9 ) can help establish the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "our results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ figure : run ] and , as expected , the situation is quite challenging .",

    "if @xmath195  ev , the situation is significantly improved , and there is also the possibility of establishing a normal mass hierarchy if @xmath196  ev and @xmath197  ev . in the next several years ( @xmath198 ) , it is reasonable to expect that we will be somewhere between fig .",

    "[ figure : run](left ) .",
    "it is curious to note that the `` main goal '' of non - oscillation neutrino experiments is , arguably , _ not _ to determine the mass hierarchy .",
    "these experiments are usually associated with establishing if the neutrinos are majorana fermions , measuring the lightest neutrino mass @xmath19 , and , ultimately , probing whether the majorana phases are nontrivial ( @xmath199 ) . while we have not concentrated on these issues here , it is clear that in the green [ gray ] regions of fig .",
    "[ figure : run ] , one is not able to properly measure @xmath19 , even when @xmath8 and @xmath9 are measured to be nonzero with good precision . in those regions , for every normal - hierarchy measurement of @xmath200 , there is an inverted hierarchy @xmath201 that fits the data just as well .",
    "we reemphasize that , in order to convert measurements of @xmath120 and cosmological data into information regarding neutrino masses , we are required to rely on several untested hypothesis , including the fact that majorana active neutrino masses are the only source of lepton number violation and the fact that we quantitatively understand the history of the universe from times slightly before big - bang nucleosynthesis until the formation of the observed large - scale structure .",
    "it is reassuring that combined measurements of @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 can help falsify these hypotheses in some regions of the parameter space , but there is a finite possibility that , after many years of data analysis , we will be left in a rather `` confused '' state .",
    "this would happen , for example , if the mass hierarchy were normal , @xmath202  ev and @xmath203  ev .",
    "we conclude by pointing out that , as far as establishing the neutrino mass ordering is concerned , we would profit tremendously with more precise information on @xmath6 .",
    "a measurement of ( or upper bound for ) @xmath6 at the several  @xmath204  ev level , combined with @xmath170 slightly below the 0.1  ev level would be sensitive to the mass hierarchy ( see fig .",
    "[ figure:2by2 ] ) , and it is easy to appreciate that extracted values of @xmath6 are significantly less model dependent than those of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "it shares several of the results presented here ( with a slightly different treatment of the `` data '' ) , and contains a very detailed discussion of the capabilities of @xmath9 and @xmath8 ( including a detailed treatment of the uncertainties related to nuclear matrix elements ) to establish the neutrino mass hierarchy and the existence of nontrivial majorana phases , and to measure @xmath19 .",
    "our contribution , on the other hand , contains a more detailed analysis ( including a detailed qualitative discussion ) of the capabilities of combined @xmath6 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 measurements to uncover the neutrino mass ordering , motivated by the fact that it will remain unknown if @xmath70 is vanishingly small , and also discusses the importance of measuring ( or further constraining ) @xmath6 .",
