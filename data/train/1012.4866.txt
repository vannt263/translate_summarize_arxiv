    "the study of dynamics of open quantum systems continuously receives attentions because of its fundamental importance in quantum physics and also because of the rapid development of quantum technologies .",
    "previous studies on the dynamics of open quantum systems mainly lie on the lindblad - type master equation @xcite , where the characteristic time of the environment is sufficiently shorter than that of the system such that the non - markovian memory effect is negligible , and so does for initial system - reservoir correlations .",
    "however , the new development in ultrafast photonics , ultracold atomic physics , nanoscience and technology as well as quantum information science strongly suggests that the non - markovian dynamics in ultrafast and ultrasmall open systems should play an important role , and the associated effects ( including the initial system - reservoir correlations ) should be fully taken into account . to this end",
    ", the more rigorous approach is demanded for the study of non - markovian dynamics of open quantum systems incorporating with the initial system - reservoir correlations .",
    "the exact description of open quantum systems has indeed been explored extensively in the literature , mainly focusing on quantum brown motion based on feynman - vernon influence functional @xcite and stochastic diffusion schrdinger equation @xcite . extending the feynman - vernon influence functional to other open quantum systems",
    "has also achieved a great success recently , including the exact master equation for electron systems and the nonequilibrium quantum transport theory in various nanostructures @xcite and the exact master equation for micro- or nanocavities in photonic crystals and the quantum transport theory for photonic crystals @xcite . however , in most of these investigations , the system and the reservoir are often assumed to be initially uncorrelated with each other @xcite .",
    "realistically , it is possible and often unavoidable in experiments that the system and its environment are correlated closely at the beginning , especially for the cases of the system strongly coupled to the reservoir @xcite .",
    "various initial - correlation induced effects have been investigated in different open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been recently shown that the initial correlations between a qubit and its environment can lead to the distance growth of two quantum states over its initial value @xcite .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the initial correlations have nontrivial differences in quantum tomography process @xcite . besides",
    ", it has been found that the initial system - reservoir correlations have significant effects on the entanglement in a two - qubit system @xcite .    in this paper , the dynamics of open quantum systems in the presence of initial system - reservoir correlations is investigated with a photonic cavity system coupled to a non - markovian reservoir as a specific example . by solving the exact dynamics of the cavity system ,",
    "the effects of the initial correlations are explicitly built into the equations of motion for the intensity and the two - photon correlation function of the cavity field .",
    "we then obtain the exact master equation incorporating with the initial correlations which induce new terms and also modify the time - dependent dissipation and fluctuation coefficients in the master equation . taking a nanocavity coupled to a coupled resonator optical waveguide ( serving as a structured reservoir ) as an experimentally realizable system , we find that the effects of the initial correlations are fragile for a markovian reservoir but play an important role in the non - markovian regime .",
    "in fact , in the strong non - markovian regime , the initial two - photon correlation between the cavity and the reservoir can induce oscillating squeezing dynamics in the cavity .",
