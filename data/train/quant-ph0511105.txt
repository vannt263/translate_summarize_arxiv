    "<S> we argue that the results for the vacuum forces on a slab and on an atom embedded in a magnetodielectric medium near a mirror , obtained using a recently suggested lorentz - force approach to the casimir effect , are equivalent to the corresponding results obtained in a traditional way . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive a general expression for the atom - atom force in a medium and extend a few classical results concerning this force in vacuum and dielectrics to magnetodielectric systems . </S>",
    "<S> this , for example , reveals that the ( repulsive ) interaction between atoms of different polarizability type is at small distances unaffected by a ( weakly polarizable ) medium .    </S>",
    "<S> although modifications of the casimir and van der waals forces due to the presence of a medium between the interacting objects were the subject of interest for a long time @xcite , this issue is still of great importance owing to the dominant role of these forces at small distances and to the rapid progress in micro and nanotechnologies . </S>",
    "<S> a common way of extending the lifshitz theory @xcite of the casimir effect @xcite to material cavities is to ( eventually ) employ the minkovski stress tensor @xmath0 when calculating the force @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , however , a lorentz - force approach to the casimir effect was suggested @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in which the relevant stress tensor is of the form ( brackets denote the average with respect to fluctuations and we use the standard notation for the macroscopic field operators ) @xmath1 in this work , we reinterpret the results for the vacuum forces on a slab and on an atom embedded in a semi - infinite magnetodielectric cavity ( see figure 1 ) as recently obtained using @xmath2 @xcite and argue their equivalence to the corresponding results obtained using @xmath3 . also , we derive a general expression for the atom - atom force in a medium and extend a few well - known results for this force to magnetodielectric systems .    when calculating @xmath2 for planar geometry @xcite , the zero - temperature force on the slab per unit area in the configuration of figure [ sys ] can be written as @xcite    @xmath4 @xmath5(i\\xi , k),\\ ] ] @xmath6(i\\xi , k)\\nonumber\\\\ \\fl & + \\frac{\\hbar}{8\\pi^2c^2}\\int_0^\\infty   d\\xi\\xi^2\\mu(n^2 - 1)\\int^\\infty_0\\frac{dkk}{\\kappa } \\sum_{q = p , s}\\delta_q \\left[\\frac{(1+r^q)^2-{t^q}^2}{(r^q\\rme^{-2\\kappa d})^{-1 } -r^q}\\right](i\\xi , k ) ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] corresponding to the decomposition of the stress tensor in ( [ t ] ) . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 is the perpendicular wave vector in the cavity at the imaginary frequency , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are fresnel coefficients for the ( symmetrically bounded ) slab and @xmath11 are those for the mirror .    </S>",
    "<S> as seen , the first term in @xmath12 may be combined with the traditional ( minkowski ) force @xmath13 to form a medium - screened casimir force , with the contributions of tm and te polarized waves scaled , respectively , by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , whereas the remaining term in @xmath12 may be regarded as a medium - assisted force @xcite . however , owing to this ( additional ) screening of the force , it turns out that the medium - screened van der waals and casimir forces have a rather unusual dependence on the material parameters of the system @xcite and , therefore , this formal combination demands reconsideration . here , </S>",
    "<S> we interpret ( 2 ) by recalling that , according to the @xmath16 quantum - field - theoretical approach to the casimir force , the minkowski stress tensor @xmath3 corresponds to the effective stress tensor in a medium which is in mechanical equilibrium @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if so , the ( unbalanced ) second term in ( [ t ] ) , which leads to @xmath12 , gives a force on the medium . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the force on the slab is given solely by the traditional force @xmath13 in ( 2 ) , whereas @xmath12 describes a force on the medium . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , note that @xmath12 vanishes when there is no medium , @xmath17 , and is nonzero when there is no slab @xmath18 [ @xmath19 and @xmath20 in ( [ tf ] ) ] , in this case clearly representing the force on a layer of the medium .    </S>",
    "<S> the force on an atom near a mirror can be obtained from ( 2 ) by assuming that the slab consists of a thin ( @xmath21 ) layer of the cavity medium with a small number of atoms @xmath22 embedded in it @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , from the lorentz - lorenz ( clausius - mossotti ) relation @xcite , it follows that @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the number density and @xmath25 the electric vacuum polarizability of embedded atoms . </S>",
    "<S> assuming a similar relation between @xmath26 , @xmath15 and the effective atomic magnetic polarizability @xmath27 , for the force on an _ embedded _ atom at distance @xmath28 from the mirror we find ( for details , see the derivation of equation ( 14 ) in @xcite and @xmath29 must be made in the last term of this equation . ] )    [ fal ] @xmath30 @xmath31r^p\\right . </S>",
    "<S> \\nonumber\\\\ \\fl & + \\left.\\left[\\alpha^a_m \\left(2\\frac{\\kappa^2c^2}{\\mu\\xi^2}-\\varepsilon\\right ) -\\alpha^a_e\\mu\\right]r^s\\right\\}(i\\xi , k),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath32r^p\\right.\\\\ \\fl & \\left.+(\\mu-1)\\left[\\alpha_m \\left(2\\frac{\\kappa^2c^2}{\\mu\\xi^2}-\\varepsilon\\right ) -\\alpha_e\\mu\\right]r^s+\\left(\\mu-\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right ) \\left[\\alpha_e\\mu r^p-\\alpha_m\\varepsilon r^s\\right]\\right\\}(i\\xi , k).\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as before , this can be combined to give a medium - screened and a medium - assisted force on the atom @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , according to the interpretation adopted here , the true force on the atom is @xmath33 , whereas @xmath34 may be regarded as an atom - induced force on the medium ( per atom ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that ( [ fa ] ) extends ( in different directions ) previous results for the atom - mirror force in various circumstances @xcite by fully accounting for the magnetic properties of the system .    </S>",
    "<S> enables one to calculate the force between two atoms in a magnetodielectric medium </S>",
    "<S> . this force can be found by assuming a single - medium mirror consisting of the cavity medium with a small number of , say , type @xmath35 atoms embedded in it , so that @xmath36 and @xmath37 . in this case , the reflection coefficients of the mirror can be approximated by @xcite @xmath38\\ ] ] and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> also , the potential energy of the atom @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the interaction energy between the atoms @xmath22 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> using the identity @xmath44 and combining these relations , from ( [ fa ] ) and ( [ rp ] ) we obtain the extension of the feinberg and sucher formula @xcite to material systems @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 .    at small distances between the atoms , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is an effective upper limit in the integration over @xmath50 @xcite ) , we may let @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 in ( [ uab ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this gives for the atom - atom force @xmath54 at small distances @xmath55 which generalizes the well - known results for the van der waals - london force @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that , whereas the force between the atoms of the same polarizability type is strongly affected by the surrounding medium , the ( repulsive ) force between the atoms of different polarizability type ( in weakly - polarizable media ) remains the same as in vacuum . at large distances between the atoms , </S>",
    "<S> the main contribution to the integral in ( [ uab ] ) comes from the @xmath56 region . </S>",
    "<S> approximating the @xmath50-dependent quantities by their static values ( denoted by the subscript @xmath57 ) and then performing the integration , we arrive at @xmath58_0 , \\label{faal}\\ ] ] which gives the medium corrections to the retarded atom - atom force @xcite and extends the previous considerations of these corrections @xcite to magnetodielectric systems . </S>",
    "<S> as seen , the repulsive component of the force is in a ( weakly - polarizable ) medium simply scaled by @xmath59 , whereas the modification of its attractive part is more complex .    </S>",
    "<S> we end this short discussion by noting that the symmetry of ( [ fa ] ) under the transformation : @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 [ and consequently that of ( [ uab])-([faal ] ) with respect to the replacements @xmath60 and @xmath61 ] is a consequence of the invariance of the minkowski stress tensor @xmath3 with respect to a duality transformation , e.g. @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this symmetry is lost in the second term of @xmath2 , so that the force @xmath34 is not invariant under the replacement of the electric and magnetic quantities . </S>",
    "<S> since the medium - screened atom - mirror and atom - atom forces are combinations of the corresponding @xmath13 s and @xmath12 s , this explains the unusual ( asymmetric ) medium effects on these forces found in @xcite .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> when properly interpreted , the result for the vacuum force on an object ( a slab or an atom ) embedded in a medium near a mirror obtained using the lorentz - force approach to the casimir effect agrees with that obtained in a traditional way . </S>",
    "<S> extensions of the well - known results for the atom - atom force to magnetodielectric systems reveals that the ( repulsive ) interaction between atoms of different polarizability type remains ( in weakly - polarizable media ) the same as in vacuum at small and is scaled by @xmath59 at large distances . </S>",
    "<S> medium corrections to the force between atoms of the same polarizability type are more complex and depend on the polarizability type of atoms . </S>",
