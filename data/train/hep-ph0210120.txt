    "one of the basic predictions of supersymmetry ( susy ) is the equality between the couplings of sm particles and that of their superpartners .",
    "the simplest processes in which this predicition could be tested , is the partial decay widths of sfermions into standard model ( sm ) fermions and charginos / neutralinos : @xmath4 by measuring these partial decay widths ( or the corresponding branching ratios ) one could measure the fermion - sfermion - chargino / neutralino yukawa couplings and compare them with the sm fermion gauge couplings .",
    "we have computed the full one - loop electroweak corrections to the partial decay widths  ( [ eq : gammadef ] ) .",
    "as we will show , the radiative corrections induce finite shifts in the couplings which are non - decoupling .",
    "the qcd corrections to the process  ( [ eq : gammadef ] ) were computed in  @xcite , and the yukawa corrections to bottom - squarks decaying into charginos was given in  @xcite .",
    "here we present the last step , namely , the full electroweak corrections in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . full details of the present work can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the computation to one - loop level of the partial decay width  ( [ eq : gammadef ] ) requires the renormalization of the full mssm lagrangian , taking into account the relations among the different sectors and the mixing parameters .",
    "we choose to work in an on - shell renormalization scheme , in which the renormalized parameters are the measured quantities .",
    "the sm sector is renormalized according to the standard on - shell sm @xmath5-scheme  @xcite , and the mssm higgs sector ( in particular the renormalization of @xmath6 ) is treated as in  @xcite .",
    "as far as the sfermion sector is concerned , we follow the procedure described in  @xcite .",
    "however , in the present analysis we treat simultaneoulsy top - squarks and bottom - squarks . due to",
    "@xmath7 invariance the parameters in these two sectors are not independent , and we can not supply with independent on - shell conditions for both sectors .",
    "we choose as input parameters the on - shell masses of both bottom - squarks , the lightest top - squark mass , and the mixing angles in both sectors : @xmath8 the remaining parameters are computed as a function of those in  ( [ eq : inputsf ] ) .",
    "in particular , the trilinear soft - susy - breaking couplings read : @xmath9 with @xmath10 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs boson doublets . the approximate ( necessary ) condition to avoid colour - breaking minima in the mssm higgs potential  @xcite , @xmath11 imposes a tight correlation between the sfermion mass splitting and the mixing angle at large @xmath6 .",
    "since the heaviest top - squark mass ( @xmath12 ) is not an input parameter , it receives finite radiative corrections : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a combination of the counterterms of the parameters in  ( [ eq : inputsf ] ) , and the counterterms of the gauge and higgs sectors .",
    "the chargino / neutralino sector contains six particles , but only three independent input parameters : the soft - susy - breaking @xmath7 and @xmath15 gaugino masses ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) , and the higgsino mass parameter ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the situation in this sector is quite different from the sfermion case , since in this case no independent counterterms for the mixing matrix elements can be introduced .",
    "we stick to the following procedure : first , we introduce a set of _ renormalized _ parameters @xmath19 in the expression of the chargino and neutralino matrices ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , and diagonalize them by means of unitary matrices @xmath22 , @xmath23 . now @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 must be regarded as _ renormalized mixing matrices_. the counterterm mass matrices are then @xmath27 , @xmath28 , which are non - diagonal . at this point , we introduce renormalization conditions for certain elements of @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in particular , we use on - shell renormalization conditions for the two chargino masses ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , which allows to compute the counterterms @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this information , together with the on - shell condition for the lightest neutralino mass ( @xmath35 ) allows to derive the expression for the counterterm @xmath36 .",
    "the other neutralino masses ( @xmath37 ) receive radiative corrections . in this framework",
    "the renormalized one - loop chargino / neutralino 2-point functions are _ non_-diagonal",
    ". therefore one must take into account this mixing either by including explicitly the reducible @xmath38 mixing diagrams , or by means of external mixing wave - function terms ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) .",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite for different ( but one - loop equivalent ) approaches to the renormalization of the chargino / neutralino sector .",
    "the complete one - loop computation consists of :    * renormalization constants for the parameters and wave functions in the bare lagrangian , * one - loop one - particle irreducible three - point functions , * mixing terms among the external charginos and neutralinos , * soft- and hard- photon bremsstrahlung .",
    "all kind of mssm particles are taken into account in the loops : sm fermions , sfermions , electroweak gauge bosons , higgs bosons , goldstone bosons , fadeev - popov ghosts , charginos , neutralinos .",
    "the computation is performed in the t hooft - feynman gauge , using dimensional reduction for the regularization of divergent integrals .",
    "the loop computation itself is done using the computer algebra packages _ feynarts 3.0 _ and _ formcalc 2.2 _  @xcite .",
    "the numerical evaluation of one - loop integrals makes use of _ looptools 1.2 _  @xcite .",
    "the results show the very interesting property that none of the particles of the mssm decouples from the corrections to the observables  ( [ eq : gammadef ] ) .",
    "this can be well understood in terms of renormalization group ( rg ) running of the parameters and susy breaking .",
    "take , e.g. , the effects of squarks in the electron - selectron - photino coupling . above the squark mass scale ( @xmath41 )",
    "the electron electromagnetic coupling ( @xmath42 ) is equal ( by susy ) to the electron - selectron - photino coupling ( @xmath43 ) , and both couplings run according to the same rg equations . at @xmath44 the squarks",
    "_ decouple _ from the rg running of the couplings . at @xmath45",
    ", @xmath42 runs due to the contributions from pure quark loops , but @xmath43 does not run anymore , and it is _ frozen _ at the squark scale , that is : @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , when comparing these two couplings at a scale @xmath45 , they differ by the logarithmic running of @xmath42 from the squark scale to @xmath47 : @xmath48 .      1 .   the non - decoupling can be used to extract information of the high - energy part of the susy spectrum : one can envisage a susy model in which a significant splitting among the different susy masses exists , e.g. @xmath49 , where the sleptons lie below the production threshold in an @xmath50 linear collider , but the squarks are above it . by means of high precision measurements of the lepton - slepton - chargino / neutralino couplings one might be able to extract information of the squark sector of the model , to be checked with the available data from the lhc .",
    "2 .   by the same token , it means that the value of the radiative corrections depends on all parameters of the model , and we can not make precise quantitative statements unless the full susy spectrum is known .",
    "this drawback can be partially overcome by the introduction of _ effective coupling matrices _ , which can be defined as follows .",
    "the subset of fermion - sfermion one - loop contributions to the self - energies of gauge - boson , higgs - bosons , goldstone - bosons , charginos and neutralinos form a gauge invariant finite subset of the corrections .",
    "therefore these contributions can be absorbed into a finite shift of the chargino / neutralino mixing matrices @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 appearing in the couplings : @xmath51 . in this way we can _ decouple _ the computation of the _ universal _ ( or _ super - oblique _",
    "@xcite ) corrections .",
    "these corrections contain the non - decoupling logarithms from sfermion masses .",
    "as an example of the _ universal _ corrections we have computed the electron - selectron contributions to the @xmath52 and @xmath53 matrices , assuming zero mixing angle in the selectron sector ( @xmath54 ) , we have identified the leading terms in the approximation @xmath55 , and analytically cancelled the divergences and the renormalization scale dependent terms ; finally , we have kept only the terms logarithmic in the slepton masses .",
    "the result for @xmath52 reads as follows : @xmath56\\,\\ , , \\nonumber\\\\ \\delta{u_{i2}}^{(f)}&=&{\\frac{\\alpha}{4\\,\\pi\\,{s_w^2}}}\\log\\left(\\frac{m^2_{\\tilde e_l}}{{\\ensuremath{m^2_x}}}\\right)\\ , { u_{i1}}\\,\\frac{{\\ensuremath{m_w}}\\,(m\\,{c_\\beta}+ \\mu\\,{s_\\beta } ) }   { 3\\,\\sqrt{2}\\,(m^2-\\mu^2)\\,{\\left(m_1 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2\\right)}^2 } \\times \\nonumber\\\\    & \\times &   \\left((m^2-\\mu^2)^2   + 4\\,m^2\\,{\\ensuremath{m^2_w}}+ 4\\,\\mu^2\\,{\\ensuremath{m^2_w}}+ 2\\,{{{\\ensuremath{m_w}}^4}}+      2\\,{{{\\ensuremath{m_w}}^4}}\\,{c_{4\\beta}}+ 8\\,m\\,\\mu\\,{\\ensuremath{m^2_w}}\\,{s_{2\\beta}}\\right)\\,\\ , ,",

    "we define parameters at very different scales , basically @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these wide - ranging scales enter the structure of the counterterms and so must appear in eq.([eq : logterms ] ) too . as a result",
    "the leading log in the various terms of this equation will vary accordingly .",
    "for simplicity in the notation we have factorized @xmath62 as an overall factor . in some cases",
    "this factor can be very big , @xmath63 ; it comes from the electron - selectron contribution to the chargino - neutralino self - energies .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ueff ] we show the relative correction to the matrix elements of @xmath24 for a sfermion spectrum around @xmath64 . the thick black lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : ueff ] correspond to spurious divergences in the relative corrections due to the renormalization prescriptions .",
    "corrections as large as @xmath65 can only be found in the vicinity of these divergence lines .",
    "however , there exist large regions of the @xmath66 plane where the corrections are larger than @xmath67 , @xmath68 , or even @xmath69 .",
