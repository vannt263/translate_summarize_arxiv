    "the problem of reduced dimensionality is one of the main themes in condensed matter physics .",
    "one reason for an explosion of interest in this field is the discovery of carbon nanotubes , which are quasi - one dimensional ( 1d ) .",
    "a similar growth of research activity has focused on clusters , which are zero - dimensional from the standpoint of statistical mechanics ( because no length diverges ) .",
    "a typical problem in these fields is the relation between properties in the reduced dimension and those in our 3d world .",
    "for example , the critical temperature of the liquid - vapor transition t@xmath0 increases monotonically from zero to a value of order the pair interaction energy as d increases from 1 to 3 or more .",
    "one might wonder , furthermore , about the evolution of behavior for systems of variable _ effective _ dimensionality d@xmath1 , such as the fluid adsorbed on a cylinder of varying radius .",
    "for very large ( small ) radius , d@xmath1 = 2 ( 1 ) .    in this paper , we evaluate the binding energy of two particles , whose nuclei are constrained to move on a spherical surface of radius r. this is related to recent work exploring the evolution of films adsorbed on a c@xmath2 buckyball and similar substrates @xcite .",
    "it is also related to an analogous study of dimer binding energy on a cylindrical surface @xcite .",
    "that study found that dimers are very strongly bound if the cylinder s diameter is of order the hard - core diameter @xmath3 of the interacting particles @xcite .",
    "in that situation , the binding energy greatly exceeds that found in the 2d limit of infinite radius .",
    "the reason for this large binding is the existence of a favorable phase space condition at a particular ratio of r/@xmath3 .",
    "we report here similar behavior in the spherical case ; that is , a particularly large binding energy e@xmath4 occurs if an analogous geometrical condition is satisfied .",
    "while this paper focuses on e@xmath4 for the dimer , experience with the analogous cylindrical surface problem suggests that properties of the many - body system will also exhibit extrema at a particular intermediate value of the ratio r/@xmath3.@xcite",
    "one may think of this geometry by imagining that one particle resides at a fixed position , the pole , * r*@xmath5 = ( x , y , z)=(0,0,r ) while the other particle moves across the spherical surface in the presence of their interaction .",
    "the schr@xmath6dinger equation uses the hamiltonian :    @xmath7 \\nabla_{2}^{2 } + v(r ) \\ , .\\ ] ]    here @xmath8 is the interacting particles reduced mass , @xmath9 is the 2d laplacian ( variable polar and azimuthal angles , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and v(r ) is taken as the usual lennard - jones(lj ) interaction with well - depth @xmath12 .",
    "the coordinate r is the 3d separation : r=2r sin@xmath13 . in all cases studied here ,",
    "we have assumed the lj parameters : for the he isotopes , @xmath3=2.556  and @xmath12 = 10.22 k , while for h@xmath14-h@xmath14 the parameters are @xmath3 = 3.04  and @xmath12 = 34.3 k. then , eq . ( 1 ) can be reduced to a dimensionless form ; the resulting equation provides an implicit relation between the reduced binding energy e@xmath15 = e@xmath4/@xmath12 and the ratio r/@xmath3 .",
    "this reduced equation involves a dimensionless quantity @xmath16}$ ] , related to the de boer quantum parameter , discussed below ; when this quantity is large , the reduced zero - point energy is large and the binding energy is small .    a useful function is the specific area @xmath17 , defined as the area of the sphere lying within a distance interval [ r , r+dr ] from * r*@xmath5 , divided by dr .",
    "a simple calculation yields the following result : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the heaviside unit step function .",
    "this result means that the most surface area lies at distance from * r*@xmath5 nearly equal to 2r , but there exists no surface at separation r@xmath202r . to take optimal advantage of the attraction , therefore",
    ", the potential minimum should lie at distance somewhat less than 2r .",
    "one can prove the following consequence of this geometry : the classical second virial coefficient of a fluid on this surface b@xmath21(t ) has a maximum when r=@xmath3/2 and decreases monotonically with r if r@xmath22/2 .",
    "one might investigate whether similar behavior occurs in the quantum case .",
    "then , the low temperature behavior is dominated by the spectrum of bound states , if any are present .",
    "we have determined the ground state energy ( -e@xmath4 ) for this problem in two ways , variational and exact , for a number of different systems , including @xmath23he -@xmath23he , @xmath23he -@xmath24he and @xmath24he -@xmath24he , as well as h@xmath14-h@xmath14 .",
    "an interesting question is this : what ratio of r/@xmath3 gives the largest binding energy e@xmath4 .",
    "since no attraction is provided by the lj potential unless r/@xmath251/2 , one might guess that the largest binding occurs when r/@xmath261 .",
    "furthermore , we expect the system to attain the largest reduced energy e@xmath15 when the particles are most classical ; a completely classical system would have e@xmath15 = 1 since the particles would maintain a spacing equal to the minimum in the potential . the criterion for `` most classical ''",
    "is the largest value of the de boer quantum parameter : @xmath27}}$ ] where @xmath28 is the mass of the interacting particles , assumed to be the same .",
    "the values are @xmath29= 3.1 , 2.7 and 1.7 for the sequence @xmath23he , @xmath24he and h@xmath14 , respectively .",
    "figure 1 presents the exact and variational energies for the various he cases .",
    "there is seen to be a maximum binding energy of order 1 to 2 k , with specific values 1.97 k , 1.38 k and 0.88 k for the sequence @xmath24he - @xmath24he , @xmath23he - @xmath24he and @xmath23he - @xmath23he , respectively .",
    "this trend manifests the expected decrease of binding energy with increasing @xmath30 ; a similar behavior was reported by kili@xmath31 _",
    "_ for dimers confined to either flat surfaces or to the interior of an spherical cavity @xcite .",
    "the maximum binding occurs with r/@xmath26 0.72 , 0.76 and 0.80 .",
    "this is analogous to the case of dimer binding of he isotopes on a cylindrical surface@xcite , with a ( somewhat smaller ) maximum binding at r/@xmath3 = 0.65 .",
    "the smaller value of r/@xmath3 in the cylindrical case is expected because the a(r ) cutoff of long range contributions to the attraction , mentioned above , is not present there .",
    "figure 1 also shows the result of a variational calculation , using a trial wave function @xmath32 of the form :    @xmath33 \\,.\\ ] ]    the two variational parameters b and n were optimized for each radius . the resulting energy in the @xmath23he - @xmath23he case , shown in fig .",
    "1 , has b=1.80 and n=2.50 at the optimal radius r/@xmath3=0.80 .",
    "note that the variational result for the binding energy is significantly lower than the exact binding energy , while the optimized radius is nearly identical to the exact one , r/@xmath3 = 0.80 .",
    "an analogous situation was found in the problem of the dimer on a cylinder@xcite .",
    "there , the optimized variational binding energy was 0.084 k , while the exact energy was 0.218 k. interestingly , the two calculations yielded the same optimal radius in that case too .",
    "figure 2 compares the probability densities for the various cases studied here .",
    "the characteristic feature is an increasing localization near the south pole as the system becomes more classical , as implied by the @xmath17 discussion above .",
    "note that the probabilities derived from the variational wave functions are more diffuse than the exact solutions",
    ".     - h@xmath14 as a function of sphere radius.,height=288 ]    in fig .",
    "3 we present the exact binding energy for the h@xmath14 - h@xmath14 dimer . in this case ,",
    "the most classical of the group reported here , the maximum e@xmath34 is 0.5 .",
    "this value is much closer to the classical value ( 1 ) than that for @xmath24he - @xmath24he ( e@xmath34=0.2 ) .",
    "one might not have anticipated such a large increase in e@xmath34 since the @xmath29 parameters are not so different ( 2.7 vs 1.8 ) .",
    "note , however , that for the he isotopes , just a 15@xmath35 difference between values of @xmath29 leads to a factor of two difference in e@xmath34 .",
    "evidently , the quantum parameter plays a critical role in this problem because the hard core potential confines the atoms to a fairly small domain on the surface .",
    "we have found particularly large binding energies for dimers of he and h@xmath14 when the particles are constrained to move on spherical surfaces having r/@xmath363/4 . this behavior is qualitatively similar to that found previously for cylindrical surfaces .",
    "a possible next step would be to explore the quantum virial expansion on this surface .",
    "such a theory would take a different form from the phase shift approach used for extended systems . from the experimental point of view",
    ", the present work suggests the intriguing possibility of spectroscopic observations of these dimer states , e.g. in a mixture of c@xmath2 molecules and he atoms . a quantitative prediction would require a study of both the excited state spectrum and the role of the third dimension , associated with the radial motion , which is ignored in the present work",
