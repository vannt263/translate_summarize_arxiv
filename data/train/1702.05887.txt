    "m86 ( ngc  4406 ) is a bright elliptical galaxy in the virgo cluster , located about , or about 350  kpc in projection , from the virgo cluster center m87 . its redshift is @xmath20 @xcite , i.e. , it is approaching us with the line - of - sight velocity of @xmath21  kms@xmath22 . on the other hand ,",
    "the redshift of m87 is @xmath23 , and it is going away from us with the line - of - sight velocity of @xmath24  kms@xmath22 .",
    "it is also reported that m86 is only about 1  mpc more distance than m87 @xcite .",
    "therefore , m86 is likely moving in the virgo cluster with a relative line - of - sight velocity of about 1500  kms@xmath22 with respect to the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "this is much larger than the velocity dispersion of galaxies in the virgo cluster ( @xmath25  kms@xmath22 ) @xcite , and hence , the direction of motion is considered close to the line - of - sight direction .",
    "since the sound speed is 730  kms@xmath22 for the cluster icm of @xmath26  kev , m86 is moving with a mach number of @xmath27 .",
    "m86 is thought to be the dominant member of one of the subgroups within the virgo cluster ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , m86 provides a good opportunity to study the interaction between the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the icm as well as the interaction between the subcluster and the icm .",
    "characteristic features of m86 were reported by various authors , especially in the x - ray band , since it is sensitive to the hot ism in the elliptical galaxies .",
    "@xcite discovered a plume of soft x - ray emission , which is thought to be stripped from m86 by ram - pressure with the virgo icm ( see also @xcite ) . using rosat data",
    ", @xcite showed that the temperatures of the galaxy and the plume are both @xmath28  kev . using chandra data",
    ", @xcite discovered a very long tail toward northwest , of 150  kpc in projection and the true length of @xmath29  kpc .",
    "they also detected a discontinuity of the x - ray surface brightness , which was interpreted as the density jump due to the shock .",
    "m86 was also observed by xmm - newton @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined the temperature and abundance distributions in detail , and reported the existence of cool ( @xmath5  kev ) gas trailing to the northwest of m86 and , also to the east of m86 in the direction of ngc  4438 .    in this paper , we report the results of our analysis of the suzaku archival data of m86 and its adjacent regions , to study the extended emission around m86 . we adopt a distance to the virgo cluster of 16.5  mpc , which gives a scale of 4.8  kpc per .",

    "there were four independent xis units ( xis03 ) , but xis2 was inoperative since 2006 november 9 , and hence , xis2 data were not available for the dataset # 1 and # 2 .",

    "it was checked that there was no statistically significant variation in the light curves of the cleaned data .",
    "contribution of the particle background ( non - x - ray background ; nxb ) of each xis unit was estimated using ` xisnxbgen ` tool and data taken when the satellite saw the night side of the earth stored in the ` caldb ` , by sorting them by the cut - off rigidity values , and properly weighting them by the exposure time ratio , based on the results by @xcite .",
    "the detector redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) were generated with ` xisrmfgen ` , using the appropriate calibration files at the time of the observation .",
    "on the other hand , responses of the x - ray telescopes were implemented into ancillary response files ( arfs ) , using ray - tracing based generator ` xissimarfgen ` @xcite .",

    "the corresponding non - x - ray background images were generated using ` xisnxbgen ` , and they were subtracted .",
    "then , flat field images were generated , and the vignetting of the x - ray telescopes was corrected by dividing the xis images with the flat field images .",
    "the mosaic was generated , the corresponding exposure map was generated using ` xisexpmapgen ` , and the mosaic was divided by the exposure map .",
    "finally , it was smoothed with a gaussian of @xmath34 ( 3 rebinned pixels ) .",
    "as clearly seen in figure  [ fig : image ] , an extended emission of a characteristic shape with two peaks was detected at the location of m86 , together with two more relatively weak sources at the position of ngc  4388 and ngc  4438 .",

    ", it appears that the icm of the virgo cluster becomes dominant .",

    "if we assume a uniform prolate spheroid of the equatorial radius of and the polar radius of for the plume , the hydrogen number density becomes @xmath108  @xmath50 and the total mass is @xmath109 .",
    "this is consistent with the numbers obtained by @xcite within a factor of 2 .",
    "if we assume a uniform cylinder of radius and height for the tail region , the hydrogen number density becomes @xmath110  @xmath50 and the total mass is @xmath111 .",
    "the mass is about 1/4 of that estimated by @xcite .",
    "major difference is that our data only covered part of the tail .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the temperatures of the core were @xmath112  kev and @xmath5  kev ( @xmath60 fit ) , while those of the plume and the tail were @xmath8  kev and @xmath9  kev , respectively .",
    "thus , the temperature of the tail was slightly higher .",
    "this is generally consistent with those reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there was a tendency that the abundances became slightly larger in the order of the core , the plume , and the tail .",
    "however , we concluded that the difference was not significant , thinking about statistical errors and also about systematic errors due to variation of the icm temperature and normalization .",
    "@xcite pointed that the temperature structure of the tail is consistent with a ram - pressure stripping model , i.e. , the hotter , higher entropy group gas is stripped first , followed by the cooler , lower entropy m86 ism .",
    "our results strongly support it , since the temperature of se3 ( @xmath113  kev ) and the fe abundance ( 0.70.8@xmath114 ) are close to those of the tail .",
    "we determined the abundances of o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe separately , and also showed that all the spectra of the different regions had a very similar abundance pattern , i.e. , o / fe , mg / fe , si / fe , and s / fe were basically consistent with the solar ratio , while ne / fe was larger by a factor of 34 .",
    "@xcite analyzed suzaku data of m86 as a whole , i.e. , including the core , the plume , and part of the tail together , and reported that ne / fe was about 3 .",
    "our analysis showed that it was the case with the center , the plume , the tail , and also the halo .",
    "the spectra of these regions ( figure  [ fig : fit_1 t ] and [ fig : plume_tail_spectra ] ) showed a peak at around 0.9  kev and a hump slightly above 1  kev .",
    "they were caused by a forest of fe l lines , and ne ly@xmath10 lines at 1022  ev ( ne @xmath115 ) , respectively , when the temperature was 0.8  kev .",
    "the peak energy due to the forest of fe l lines rises as the temperature rises .",
    "therefore , the spectral shape in this energy region is mainly determined by the temperature and the abundances of fe and ne .",
    "the ne abundance by @xcite is about 60% of that provided by @xcite or @xcite . in the recent solar abundances provided by @xcite ,",
    "the ne abundance is much closer to @xcite or @xcite .",
    "even if the new value were adopted , ne overabundance would be still significant , by a factor of 23 .",
    "this common abundance pattern , which is derived from the very similar spectral shapes , is one evidence that the hot gas in the plume and the tail regions has the same origin as that in the core .",
    "@xcite reported that the large ne / fe ratio can not be explained by any mixture of sne type ia and core - collapse sne , and concluded that ne abundance may have intrinsically large systematic errors because their emission lines are hidden by prominent fe - l lines .",
    "we further investigated it . to check model uncertainties , we fitted the center data with spex 3.0 @xcite .",
    "when the temperature was fixed at the same number , the abundances differed by @xmath116% . however , the difference of ne / fe was only about 5% , and hence , there was no significant difference between the results based on apec and spex . according to atomdb",
    ", there is an fe l line ( fe @xmath117 ) at 1023 ev .",
    "in addition , there is a strong fe l line ( fe @xmath118 ) at 1009  ev , whose emissivity is comparable to the summation of two ne ly@xmath10 lines when the temperature is @xmath28  kev , and reaches the maximum when the temperature is @xmath119  kev .",
    "therefore , it may be difficult to determine the abundance of ne precisely in this temperature range unless ne ly@xmath10 lines are separated from strong fe l lines .",
    "note that @xcite showed high - resolution spectra of m86 obtained with xmm - newton reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs ) , and the fe @xmath120 line seemed to be resolved .",
    "however , the neon abundance was not reported .",
    "the extended emission around m86 was clearly detected with suzaku . according to the xis mosaic shown in figure  [ fig : image ]",
    ", it extends over ( 72  kpc ) from the center in the east direction , and over ( 48  kpc ) in the south - west direction . with the moderate spatial resolution of suzaku",
    ", the surface brightness profile of the core and the extended halo was represented with a single @xmath2 model of @xmath3 , as described in section  [ sec : image_analysis ] , and it indicated that the emission spreads to @xmath121 ( @xmath122  kpc ) .",
    "this picture is consistent with the the spectral fit of se6 region ( @xmath123 ) , which showed the existence of a component of @xmath124  kev .",
    "if the surface brightness extends to a certain distance following a @xmath2 model , the actual extent of the gas must be significantly larger .",
    "therefore , our results strongly suggest that the halo of m86 extends over 100  kpc , at least in the east direction .    using the effective radius @xmath125 of @xcite ,",
    "suzaku detected x - ray emission up to @xmath126 in se16 regions .",
    "the ratio of the temperature at 48@xmath125 to that at @xmath127 was @xmath128 , showing the positive temperature gradient in the central region .",
    "@xcite denoted galaxies with the temperature ratio @xmath129 as x - ray extended galaxies and others as x - ray compact galaxies . according to their criteria ,",
    "m86 is located in the boundary area .",
    "the ratio of the stellar velocity dispersion to the gas temperature @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the mean molecular weight in terms of the proton mass @xmath132 , is @xmath133 , for the gas temperature of 0.9  kev and the stellar velocity dispersion of 256  kms@xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this is close to the typical number of the x - ray extended elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the halo gas is located in a larger scale potential structure than that of the galaxy , such as a galaxy group @xcite .      in section  [ sec : image_analysis ]",
    ", we showed the surface brightness distribution is represented by a @xmath2 model of @xmath3 . in this section",
    ", we estimate the gas mass assuming the @xmath2 model obtained in section  [ sec : image_analysis ] .",
    "the @xmath2 model was valid from the position angle @xmath0 to @xmath1 , covering about 64% of the whole area , and hence , we used only this region .    in section  [ sec :",
    "core_halo_norm ] , we estimated that the hydrogen number density in the core was @xmath134@xmath135  @xmath50 , assuming a uniform sphere of radius .",
    "we first calculated the total emission measure along the line - of - sight through the m86 center ( @xmath136 ) assuming the @xmath2 model parameters shown in table  [ tab : sb_fit ] , and derived the density at @xmath137 .",
    "it became ( 4.06.3)@xmath138  @xmath50 . in the following discussion , we assume that the hydrogen number density at @xmath137 is @xmath139  @xmath50 .    if the @xmath2 model for the surface brightness distribution is valid to infinity , the density is given by the following function : @xmath140 since the hydrogen number density at the center is @xmath139  @xmath50 , the density at @xmath141  kpc is @xmath142  @xmath50 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the electron density of the virgo icm is @xmath142  @xmath50 at about 350  kpc from the center of the virgo cluster .",
    "hence , the densities of the halo gas and the icm are comparable at around @xmath143  kpc .",
    "the mass of the halo gas was estimated by @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the radius of the gas , @xmath146 is the angle of the @xmath147-th sector , @xmath148 is the mass density at @xmath149 of the @xmath147-th sector .",
    "the gas mass thus obtained is shown in figure  [ fig : mass ] as a function of radius .",
    "the mass of the halo gas in @xmath17  kpc became @xmath15 .",
    "we further estimated the dynamical mass assuming the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the halo must be affected by the motion of m86 in the virgo cluster , and also by the ram - pressure stripping , and hence , the hydrostatic equilibrium will not be a good approximation .",
    "however , we think it is still useful to discuss the condition of m86 .",
    "we calculated the dynamical mass using the following equation : @xmath150 assuming the temperature is almost constant .",
    "the dynamical mass thus obtained is also shown in figure  [ fig : mass ] .",
    "it became @xmath16 for @xmath17  kpc .",
    "then the ratio of the gas mass to the dynamical mass @xmath151 became @xmath152 .",
    "@xcite decomposed the x - ray surface brightness distribution obtained with rosat into several components , and estimated the total mass within 280  kpc is ( 13)@xmath153 .",
    "if we use their number , @xmath151 becomes only @xmath154 .",
    "if we extend our calculation to 230  kpc ( difference of the distance corrected ) assuming the same @xmath2 models are valid , the gas mass becomes @xmath155 , and the ratio is @xmath156 .",
    "@xcite reported that the galaxy mass within 240  kpc from m86 center is @xmath157 , and the ratio of the galaxy mass to the total mass is 26% .",
    "therefore , depending on the actual spread of the gas , the ratio of the gas mass to the galaxy mass also significantly differs , from @xmath158 to @xmath159 .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the gas mass fractions of clusters to the hydrostatic mass are about 0.020.1 .",
    "they also found that the ratio is @xmath18 for several subhalos in the coma cluster , indicating significant fraction of the gas was removed due to interaction with the icm , such as ram - pressure stripping .",
    "our results implicate that the gas mass to the dynamical mass ratio of m86 is @xmath18@xmath19 , suggesting it is also significantly affected by the interaction with the icm .      according to @xcite ,",
    "the ram - pressure stripping occurs when the ram - pressure of the cluster gas exceeds the force holding the gas in the galaxy : @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the icm and ism densities , and @xmath163 is the galaxy velocity dispersion ( see also @xcite ) . at the core of m86 ,",
    "the ram - pressure is @xmath57  ev@xmath50 and @xmath164 is @xmath165  ev@xmath50 , for @xmath166  @xmath50 , @xmath167  @xmath50 , @xmath168  kms@xmath22 , and @xmath169  kms@xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the ram - pressure stripping condition is satisfied even in the core .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the mean free path @xmath170 of the coulomb collisions of two protons that causes the large deflection ( @xmath171 ) is given by @xmath172 and the time needed for the particle to travel the mean free path is given by @xmath173 they were calculated for the core and the halo and are shown in table  [ tab : mfp ] .",
    "the mean free path is comparable to the diameter of the core and the halo , and hence , the close coulomb collisions occur with a large probability .",
    "in fact , there are much more distant scatterings , and the mean free path and the travel time will be shorten by a factor of the coulomb logarithm ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "[ tab : mfp ]    time needed to strip all the halo gas is simply estimated by the total number of the halo gas divided by the flux of the icm , i.e. , @xmath175 it becomes @xmath176  y in the core , and @xmath177  y in the outer halo .",
    "since the distance between m86 and m87 is 350  kpc in projection , the crossing time is @xmath178.\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath179 , and hence , most of the gas in the core and in the halo will be stripped if m86 passes through the virgo cluster center once .",
    "we showed that the gas of low metal abundance still remains in the outer halo . on the other hand",
    ", it was indicated that the gas mass to the dynamical mass ratio is @xmath18@xmath19 , which suggests significant fraction of the halo gas has been stripped .",
    "the m86 group is experiencing the stripping by the virgo icm right now .      as shown in section  [ sec : image_analysis ] , a faint x - ray clump was detected near ngc  4388 .",
    "the temperature of the gas was @xmath180  kev and its flux in the 0.52  kev band was @xmath181  erg@xmath41s@xmath22 .",
    "we could not find any literature mentioning it .",
    "we checked the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) to see if there are any associations with known background groups or clusters .",
    "one cluster whl  j122512.2@xmath182142722 at @xmath183 and one group sdsscgb  65849 were found near the xis field of view , but it is unlikely that either of them is an optical counterpart .",
    "next , we looked for galaxies with known redshift and x - ray sources in ned . the results are summarized in figure  [ fig : clump ] . among them , ic  3303 is located near the brightest part of the x - ray clump .",
    "the redshift of this galaxy is @xmath184 @xcite , which is very close to that of m86 .",
    "therefore , this clump might be part of the m86 subgroup gas , though it is separated from the extended emission around m86 .",
    "further study is needed .",
    "we analyzed the suzaku data of m86 and its adjacent regions to study the extended emission around it .",
    "the m86 core , the plume , and the tail extending toward the northwest were clearly detected , as well as the extended halo around them . from the position angle @xmath0 to @xmath1 , the surface brightness distribution was represented relatively well with a single @xmath2-model of @xmath3 up to .    the suzaku xis spectra of the m86 center , the extended halo , the plume , and the tail were explained with one- or two - temperature plasma model , in addition to the virgo icm of @xmath185  kev and other background / foreground components .",
    "the temperatures of the center were @xmath80  kev and @xmath5  kev .",
    "the temperatures of the core and the halo have a positive gradient , and reach the maximum of @xmath6  kev at @xmath7 or @xmath186 . outside it , it is almost constant or slightly decreasing toward the outer regions . the temperature of the plume and the tail were @xmath8  kev and @xmath9  kev , respectively .",
    "therefore , the temperature of the tail is slightly higher than the core and the plume . these were qualitatively consistent with the previous chandra and xmm - newton results @xcite .",
    "we succeeded in determining the abundances of o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe separately , for the core , the plume , the tail , and the halo for the first time .",
    "the best - fit values of the fe abundance in the core and in the plume were @xmath11 , while that in the tail was slightly higher ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "however , we can not conclude that the abundance in the tail is higher , thinking about the normalization and the temperature variation of the icm .",
    "the abundance of the halo is almost the same up to @xmath187 , and then it becomes significantly smaller ( 0.20.3 ) at @xmath14 .",
    "this means that the gas in the outer halo is less polluted by the metals produced in the galaxy .",
    "in all the regions , the abundance ratios of o , mg , si , and s to fe were @xmath180 , while ne / fe showed a significantly larger number ( 24 ) .",
    "this ne overabundance is coming from the spectral features at around 1  kev , and is another evidence that the plume and the tail have the same origin as the core .",
    "however , the overabundance by a factor of 24 can not be explained by the uncertainty of the abundances , or mixture of known sne nucleosynthesis models .",
    "ne abundance may have intrinsically large systematic errors as suggested by @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that the halo of m86 extends over 100  kpc , at least in the east direction .",
    "the temperature at the center is slightly lower , and the ratio of the stellar velocity dispersion to the gas temperature is only 0.47 .",
    "these features indicate that the extended halo gas is located in a larger scale potential structure than that of the galaxy , such as a galaxy group @xcite . using the @xmath2 models for sectors , we estimated the gas mass from the position angle @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( 64% of the whole area ) .",
    "it was @xmath15 in @xmath17  kpc .",
    "if we further assume the hydrostatic equilibrium , the dynamical mass in the same region was @xmath16 , giving the ratio of the gas mass to the dynamical mass @xmath188 . if we adopt the dynamical mass within 230  kpc provided by @xcite , the ratio becomes @xmath154 .",
    "these ratios suggest the halo of m86 is significantly affected by the interaction with the virgo icm .",
    "simple estimation of the ram - pressure stripping lengthscales and timescales showed that the mean free path is comparable to the size of the core or the halo , and the stripping timescale is comparable or shorter than the crossing time through the virgo center .",
