    "the standard approach to cosmological modelling commences with the assumption that our @xmath0dimensional space is homogeneous and isotropic at large scales .",

    "the metric  ( [ rwmetric ] ) only express the above assumptions , it does not specify the underlying spacetime manifold @xmath12 nor the corresponding spatial sections @xmath13 . in this geometrical approach to model the physical world the dynamics of the universe is clearly provided by a metrical theory of gravitation as , for example , general relativity .",
    "the friedmann equation @xmath14 is @xmath15 with @xmath16 , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are , respectively , the scale factor and the hubble parameter at @xmath19 . ]",
    "makes apparent that the curvature ( or the corresponding geometry ) of the spatial section @xmath13 of the universe is an observable in that for @xmath20 the spatial section is positively curved , for @xmath21 it is flat ( @xmath22 ) , while for @xmath23 it is negatively curved .",
    "thus , a chief point in the search for the ( spatial ) geometry of universe is to constrain the density @xmath24 from observations . in the context of the current standard cosmological model ,",
    "i.e. , the @xmath25cdm scenario , this amounts to determining regions in the density parametric plane @xmath26@xmath4 , which consistently account for the observations , and from which one expects to infer the spatial geometry of the universe .    in practice , to observationally probe the spatial geometry of the universe , by using , e.g. , a single observational data set as the current type ia supenovae ( sne ia ) observations , various degeneracies arise in the parametric plane @xmath26@xmath4 ( riess et al .",
    "these degeneracies are mitigated by either imposing reasonable priors , or combining the data with complementary observations , or both .",
    "an example in this regard is the combination of the current supernovae ia ( snia ) compilation ( riess et al .",
    "2004 ) with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) galaxy power spectrum ( tegmark et al . 2004 ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) measurements by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe [ wmap ] ( bennet et al . 2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , which has remarkably narrowed the bounds on the cosmological density parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "besides being sensitive to different combination of the density parameters , these measurements probe the geometry of the universe at considerably different redshifts ( typically @xmath27 for sne ia or @xmath28 for cmb ) .",
    "however , the spatial geometry constrains but does not dictate the topology of the @xmath0space @xmath13 , and although the spatial section @xmath13 is usually taken to be one of the simply - connected spaces , namely euclidean @xmath29 , spherical @xmath30 , or hyperbolic @xmath31 , it is a mathematical result that great majority of locally homogeneous and isotropic @xmath0spaces @xmath13 are multiply - connected quotient manifolds of the form @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a fixed - point free group of isometries of the corresponding covering space .",
    "thus , for example , for the euclidean geometry ( @xmath22 ) besides @xmath36 there are 6 classes of topologically distinct compact orientable spaces @xmath13 that can be endowed with this geometry , while for both the spherical ( @xmath37 ) and hyperbolic ( @xmath38 ) geometries there are an infinite number of topologically inequivalent manifolds with non - trivial topology that can be endowed with each one of these geometries .",
    "now since the spatial geometry is an observable that constrains but does not determine the topology of the @xmath0space @xmath13 , two pertinent questions at this point are whether the topology may be an observable and , if so , to what extent it can be used to remove or at least reduce the degeneracies in the density parameter plane @xmath26@xmath4 , which arise from statistical analyses with data from current observations .",
    "the main aim of this paper , which extends and complements our previous work ( reboucas et al .",
    "2005 ) , is to address these questions in the context of the @xmath25cdm scenario , by focusing our attention on the finite and positively curved poincar space model ( luminet et al .",
    "2003 ) that accounts for the suppression of power at large scales observed by wmap(bennet et al . 2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , and also fits the wmap temperature two - point correlation function ( aurich et al . 2005a ; 2005b ; gundermann 2005 ) . in other words",
    ", we shall show how to use the poincar dodecahedral space as a circles  in  the - sky observable topology of the universe . ] to reduce the inherent degeneracies in the density parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 that arise from the so - called _ gold _ set of 157 sne ia , as compiled by riess _",
    "( 2004 ) , along with the latest chandra measurements of the x - ray gas mass fraction in 26 galaxy clusters , as provided by allen _",
    "in a number of recent papers different strategies and methods to probe a non - trivial topology of the spatial section of the universe have been discussed ( see , e.g. , lehoucq et al , 1996 ; roukema and edge , 1997 ; gomero et al . , 2002 ; fagundes and gausmann , 1999 ; uzan et al , 1999 ; hajian and souradeep , 2005 ; hajian et al . , 2005 ; and the review articles lachize - rey and luminet , 1995 ; starkman , 1998 ; levin , 2002 ; rebouas and gomero , 2004 ) .",
    "an immediate observational consequence of a detectable non - trivial topology of the @xmath0space @xmath13 is that the sky will show multiple ( topological ) images of either cosmic objects or repeated patterns of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) . here , we shall focus on the so - called  circles - in - the - sky \" method , which relies on multiple copies of correlated circles in the cmbr maps ( cornish et al .",
    "1998 ) , whose existence is clear from the following reasoning : in a universe with a detectable non - trivial topology , the sphere of last scattering necessarily intersects some of its topological images along pairs of circles of equal radii , centered at different points on the last scattering sphere ( lss ) , with the same distribution of temperature fluctuations , @xmath39 , along the circles correlated by an element @xmath40 of the covering group @xmath35 .",
    "since the mapping from the last scattering surface to the night sky sphere preserves circles ( penrose , 1959 ; calvo et al . ,",
    "2005 ) , these pairs of matching circles will be written on the cmbr anisotropy sky maps regardless of the background geometry and for any non - trivial detectable topology . as a consequence , to observationally probe a non - trivial topology on the available largest scale , one should suitably scrutinize the full - sky cmb maps in order to extract the correlated circles , whose angular radii and relative position of their centers can be used to determine the topology of the universe .",
    "thus , a non - trivial topology of the space section of the universe may be an observable , which can be probed through the circles in the sky for all locally homogeneous and isotropic universes with no assumption on the cosmological density parameters .    regarding the question as to whether the topology can be used as an observable to reduce degeneracies in the cosmological density parameters ,",
    "we first note that the topology of a locally homogeneous and isotropic @xmath0manifold determines the sign of its curvature ( see , e.g. , bernshtein and shvartsman , 1980 ) , and therefore the topology of the spatial section @xmath13 of the universe dictates its geometry . as a consequence",
    ", the detection of a _ generic _ cosmic topology alone would give rise to a strong degeneracy on both density parameters , since it only determines whether the density parameters take values in the regions below , above , or on the flat line @xmath41 .    in what follows",
    "we examine to what extent a combination of the circles  in  the  sky detection of a _ specific _ spatial topology , namely , the poincar dodecahedral space topology ( which accounts for some observed anomalies in wmap cmb data ) with the current snia and galaxy clusters measurements may reduce the intrinsic density parameter degeneracies of the @xmath26@xmath4 plane .",
    "the poincar dodecahedral space @xmath42 is a manifold of the form @xmath33 in which @xmath43 is the binary icosahedral group of order @xmath44 .",
    "it is represented by a regular spherical dodecahedron ( @xmath45 pentagonal faces ) along with the identification of the opposite faces after a twist of @xmath46 .",
    "such a space is positively curved , and tiles the @xmath0sphere @xmath30 into @xmath44 identical spherical dodecahedra .    by assuming some priors and combining cmb data with other astronomical data , the wmap team reported ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) both the best fit value @xmath47 ( @xmath48 level ) , which includes a positively curved universe as a realistic possibility , and account for the suppression of power at wide angles ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 ) .",
    "these facts have motivated the suggestion by luminet _",
    "( 2003 ) of the poincar dodecahedral space topology as an explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the @xmath25cdm concordance model and wmap data .",
    "since then , the dodecahedral space has been examined in some works ( cornish et al , 2004 ; roukema et al . ,",
    "2004 ; aurich et al , 2005a ; 2005b ; gundermann , 2005 ) , in which some further features of the model have been carefully considered . as a result",
    ", it turns out that a universe with the poincar dodecahedral space section accounts for the suppression of power at large scales observed by wmap , and fits the wmap temperature two - point correlation function for @xmath51 ( aurich et al , 2005a ; 2005b ) , retaining the standard friedmann  lematre ",
    "walker ( flrw ) foundation for local physics .. this absence of evidence of correlated may be due to several causes , among which it is worth mentioning that doppler and integrated sachs - wolfe contributions to these circles may be strong enough to blur them , and so the correlated circles can have been overlooked in the cmb maps search ( aurich et al .",
    ", 2005a ) . in this way",
    ", the ` absence of evidence may not be evidence of absence ' , specially given that effects such as sunyaev - zeldovich and the finite thickness of the lss , as well as possible systematics in the removal of the foregrounds , can further damage the topological circle matching .",
    "] on this observational grounds , in what follows , we assume the poincar dodecahedron as the specific circles  in  the - sky detected @xmath0space topology of the universe .",
    "an important class of manifolds with a non - trivial topology is comprised by the globally homogeneous manifolds . these manifolds satisfy a topological principle of ( global ) homogeneity , in the sense that all points in @xmath13 are topologically equivalent .",
    "in particular , in these spaces the pairs of matching circles of the circles  in  the  sky method will be antipodal , as shown in figure  [ cinthesky1 ] .",
    "the poincar dodecahedral space ( pds ) @xmath42 is globally homogeneous , and gives rise to six pairs of antipodal matched circles on the lss , centered in a symmetrical pattern as the centers of the faces of the dodecahedron .",
    "figure  [ cinthesky1 ] gives an illustration of two of these antipodal circles .",
    "clearly the distance between the centers of each pair of circles is twice the radius @xmath52 of the sphere inscribable in @xmath42 .",
    "now , a straightforward use of a napier s rule to the right - angled spherical triangle shown in fig .

    "we proceed in the following way .",

    "we emphasize that this particular combination of observational data covers complementary aspects of the @xmath26@xmath4 plane , in that while x - ray measurements are very effective to place limits on the clustered matter ( @xmath1 ) the new sne ia sample tightly constrains the unclustered component ( @xmath2 ) .",
