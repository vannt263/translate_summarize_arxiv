    "recent years the big volume of work devoted to the experimental study of the photon - photon interactions , in particular , to the study of the photonic production of the charmed particles was carried out at the accelerator lep . in this connection , and also in connection with prospects for construction of the largest @xmath1-collider tesla ( desy ) there is a necessity of the detailed discussion of the photon - photon interaction mechanisms at large energies . in the given work we shall consider some questions concerning the photonic production of heavy quarks , namely , we shall discuss features of the exclusive and the inclusive charmed meson pair production and estimate its contribution into the total cross section of the charm production . in the frame work of the constituent quark model ( cqm )",
    "we shall show , that the light valence quark inside d - meson plays the essential role not only in the hardonization process , but also in the hard production of the heavy quark .",
    "because of strong interaction of the photonic field with the light quark charge the similar situation is kept even in a limit @xmath0 .",
    "it is worth to notice , that for the exclusive pair production of the charmed meson in the @xmath1-annihilation cqm and the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) give the same prediction for @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless at the conventional values of masses of the light and heavy quarks the results of cqm for the @xmath1-interactions strongly differ from the results of the hqet .",
    "we begin our article with the discussion of the heavy meson production in the @xmath1-annihilation , because it is the most simple process , and because it is considered in detail in the literature .",
    "the work@xcite presents one of the first attempts to formulate the hqet for the case of the @xmath3-meson production in the @xmath1-annihilation .",
    "the neglect of spin - spin interaction between the heavy and light quarks , which is suppressed as @xmath4 , has allowed to obtain the interesting ratio for the pair production of @xmath3 and @xmath5-meson near the threshold ( see the appendix ) : @xmath6    more detailed analysis of the exclusive @xmath7-pair production in the @xmath1-interaction on the basis of the cqm , was carried out in work @xcite .",
    "it is worth to remind , that cqm is based on the assumptions , that in the partonic distributions of the final meson there are the valence quark contributions , and that both valence quarks are produced in the hard process followed by the fusion of these quarks into the meson .",
    "the analytical expressions for the exclusive meson pair production look as follows @xcite:@xmath8    @xmath9 \\frac{m^{3}_{q}\\alpha _ { s}(m^{2}_{q})}{m^{3}_{q}\\alpha _ { s}(4m^{2}_{q})}\\right\\ } ^{2},\\ ] ]    @xmath10 ^{2},\\ ] ]    @xmath11 ^{2}\\times\\ ] ]    @xmath12 , \\ ] ]    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are masses of the light and heavy quarks correspondingly ; @xmath15 and @xmath16 are leptonic coupling constants for the pseudoscalar and vector meson states correspondingly ; @xmath17 ; @xmath18 ; and the parameter @xmath19 is expressed by the formula :    @xmath20 at @xmath0 the ratio of the cross sections on the threshold looks like :    @xmath21    thus if one neglects the difference between the values of @xmath16 and @xmath15 , then([eeotn ] ) coincides with([eeotn0 ] ) .",
    "the heavy quark effective theory predicts the ratio which at a threshold also coincides with ( [ eeotn0 ] ) :    @xmath22 where the @xmath23 -correction has the following form : @xmath24    the four feynmann diagrams of @xmath25 order contribute to the cross sections ( [ eepp ] ) , ( [ eepv ] ) , ( [ eevv ] ) ( see fig.[eediagr ] ) .",
    "these diagrams can be separated into two gauge invariant pairs .",
    "the first pair ( two top diagrams of fig.[eediagr ] ) corresponds to the interaction of the virtual photon with the heavy quark and is proportional to the heavy quark charge squared .",
    "the value of @xmath23 for this diagram pair is calculated at the scale of @xmath26 , because the gluonic propagator couples with the two light quarks . the second diagram pair ( the two bottom diagrams of the fig .",
    "[ eediagr ] ) corresponds to the interaction of virtual photon with the light quark and is proportional to the light quark charge . for these diagrams @xmath23",
    "is calculated at the scale @xmath27 .",
    "it is clear , that this contribution is suppressed by the factor @xmath28 due to the gluonic propagator coupled with the pair of heavy quarks .",
    "one can see from ( [ eepp ] ) , ( [ eepv ] ) , ( [ eevv ] ) , that at @xmath0 it is possible to neglect the interaction of the light quark with the initial virtual photon .",
    "it is necessary to note , that the contribution of that interaction is small already for the masses of constituents of the @xmath3-meson ( for present calculations the following values of masses were chosen : @xmath29  gev and @xmath30  gev ) .",
    "however , the spin - spin interaction at these values of masses plays the essential role and brakes the ratio ( [ eeotn0 ] ) : @xmath31    so , the @xmath7-pair production in the @xmath1-annihilation occurs as follows : a pair of heavy quarks is produced in a hard process , and then these quarks are hadronized by means of interaction with the light quark sea .",
    "it is worth to remind , that in the inclusive production of @xmath3-mesons in the @xmath1-annihilation , where the fragmentation mechanism can be applied@xcite , the @xmath32-quarks are hadronized by the same manner .",
    "thus , the role of light quark in the hard process of the @xmath32-quark production in the @xmath1-annihilation is insignificant . on the contrary , in the photon - photon production",
    "the light quark role is essential as will be shown bellow .",
    "in the framework of the cqm the photonic exclusive production of two charmed mesons is described by twenty feynmann tree level diagrams ( see the fig . [ diagrams ] ) , which can be separated into three gauge invariant groups .",
    "the first of them corresponds to a case when the heavy quark radiate the gluon which splits into a pair of light quarks ( diagrams 1 - 6 of the fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ) .",
    "the contribution of this group is proportional to the square of the heavy quark charge . in the second group of diagrams ( the diagram 7 - 12 ) , on the contrary",
    ", the heavy quark production occurs by means of the splitting of the gluon which is radiated by the light quark .",
    "these diagrams are proportional to the square of the light quark charge and suppressed by the factor @xmath34 due to the gluonic propagator which is proportional to @xmath35 .    in the third group of diagrams ( the diagram of 13 - 20 fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ) each pair of quarks is connected to its  own ",
    "our calculations show , that the interaction of the light quark with the initial photon field described by these diagrams is not suppressed and plays the essential role in the exclusive pair production of the charmed meson in the photon - photon interaction .",
    "this interaction leads to the discrepancy between the predictions of hqet and cqm , which is not negligible even at @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the interaction of the light constituent quark with the initial photon is so large , that hqet can not be applied in this case .    nevertheless , if one puts the light quark charge equal to zero in our calculations ( this case corresponds to the rejection of the diagrams of the second and third groups , i.e. 7 - 20 of fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] ) then the conformity between cqm and hqet is restored .",
    "thus , at zero charge of the light quark and @xmath0 we have received on the threshold the following ratio:@xmath37 predicted in the work@xcite , where the approach @xcite is applied to the case of photonic production ( see appendix ) . if the light quark charge is differ from zero then its interaction with the photonic field becomes essential for the @xmath7-pair production .",
    "moreover , our calculation show , that @xmath0 and @xmath38 lead to @xmath39 it means that the mechanism of the exclusive production based on the production of the heavy quark pair followed by their hadronization appears not valid . as it is shown in the work @xcite , such approach is not valid in the case of the inclusive production too .    in the fig .",
    "[ ddcharged ] we present the exclusive cross sections of the photonic pair production of the charmed mesons @xmath40 ( open circles ) , @xmath41 ( open triangles ) , @xmath42 ( open squares ) calculated by us in the framework of the cqm as a function of @xmath43 with the following values of parameters:@xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46    as well as in the case of production in the @xmath1-annihilation , the cross sections @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are proportional to @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , accordingly .",
    "the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 estimated in the frame work of the sum rules , as well as in the frame work of the lattice calculations are about @xmath50 . however , the absolute normalization of the cross sections in our model depends not only on these constants , but also on the light quark mass .",
    "the variation of the light quark mass can result in the change of the cross section normalization .",
    "on the other hand , we can normalize the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 on the base of the fragmentation probability @xmath51 in the @xmath1-interaction at large energies ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "thus the values of @xmath13 and @xmath53 appear correlated to each other , that allows to minimize the cross section uncertainty within 2 - 2.5 . however , with such normalization the constant @xmath53 appears overestimated at all reasonable values of the light quark mass .",
    "we believe , that this overestimate of the constant @xmath53 is due to the account for the contribution of the excited state decays , for example , of @xmath54 . in the exclusive production such situation should not be observed .",
    "thus , the question of the absolute normalization for the exclusive channels remains open and the values in fig.[ddcharged ] should be considered as the top limit of the cross section . for all conclusions connected to the relative yield of @xmath3-mesons the discussed circumstances are not essential .",
    "let us notice , that near the threshold @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the module of three - momentum of the final meson in the center - of - mass frame of the charmed meson pair .",
    "the twice logarithmic scale of the picture reveals , that the cross section depends on @xmath57 near the threshold as : @xmath58    @xmath59    the point is that in the @xmath60-interaction the @xmath7- and @xmath61-pairs are produced in s - wave state ( l=0 ) , and @xmath62-pairs are produced in p - wave state ( l=1 ) .",
    "it is known , that near the threshold the behavior of reactions with two particles in the final state submits to the law :    @xmath63    the diagrams of fig.[diagrams ] which describes the processes @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 are written at the quark level and the  \" twisting  \" of the final mesons into the necessary wave occurs automatically .",
    "hence , the observable behavior of the cross sections near threshold is the additional confirmation of the calculation correctness .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ ddcharged ] , that the hqet ratio ( [ ratio3 ] ) is broken .",
    "our calculations show , that near the threshold    @xmath67    it is interesting to consider the case when the interaction of the light quark with the initial photon can be neglected i.e. when the electric charge of the light quark is put equal to zero .",
    "the black markers in fig .",
    "[ ddcharged ] show the results of the calculations of the charmed meson pair production cross sections at a zero light quark charge .",
    "one can see , that near the threshold the ratio @xmath68 is practically the same as predicted by ( [ ratio3 ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to mention , that the contribution from the interaction between the photon and the light quark can be positive ( the case of @xmath61-pair production ) , as well as negative ( the case of @xmath7 or @xmath69 -pair production ) .",
    "let us note also , that contribution of this interaction has the minimal absolute value for the @xmath69 -pair production , i.e. when the mesons are formed in the @xmath70-wave state .",
    "the extremely essential role of the light quark in the charmed meson production can be understood from the difference between the production of neutral mesons and the charged ones .",
    "this difference can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ dd0 ] , where the @xmath57-dependence of the neutral meson cross section ( the black markers ) is shown in comparison with the same dependence for charged mesons ( the open ones ) .",
    "for example , near the threshold for the charged mesons @xmath71 in the contrary to @xmath72 for the neutral ones .",
    "it is necessary to note , that the least difference between the charged and neutral meson production is observed for the production of @xmath62-pairs i.e. when the mesons are produced in the p - wave state .",
    "the more striking differences can be observed between the neutral and charged b - meson production . in fig .",
    "[ bb ] the production cross section of the neutral b - meson is given as a function of @xmath43 for @xmath73 gev and @xmath30 .",
    "in the case of d - meson production the cross section dependences on @xmath57 have the qualitatively identical form both for the charged particles and for the neutral ones ( see fig . [ dd0 ] ) . for the b - meson production it is not so .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ bb ] , that at @xmath74 gev ( @xmath75 gev ) the interferential minimum is observed for the production of two charged pseudo - scalar mesons @xmath76 and @xmath77 and not observed for the pair production of the neutral pseudo - scalar mesons @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "so , for all interaction energies it is necessary to take into account the light quark contribution into the photonic production of heavy mesons .",
    "the models which are not taking into account this contribution can not be applied even for the qualitative description of the considered process .",
    "it is clear from the analysis of the photonic pair production of the heavy mesons , that the naive ideas which transferred from the @xmath1-annihilation appear not valid . for the processes @xmath64 and @xmath80 the role of light quarks appears essential both in the soft process of the hadronization and in the hard pair production of the heavy quarks .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental data on the heavy meson pair production near threshold do not exist yet .",
    "such data could throw light on the dynamics of production of mesons with the heavy quarks .",
    "as it was already mentioned , the exclusive heavy meson production data would allow to compare the predictions of various models , however the opportunities of experiment in this direction of researches are strongly limited . for today",
    "the majority of measurements are made for the inclusive @xmath3-meson production . to describe this process a number of the calculations",
    "is carried out in the framework of nlo qcd for the massive c - quarks @xcite , as well as for c - quarks @xcite .",
    "these calculations result in the satisfactory description of the data , however , the use of the fragmentation mechanism result in specific predictions for the relative yield of charged and neutral mesons . in these models",
    "the @xmath5-yield does not depend on the meson type : @xmath81 .",
    "let us consider now the prediction of our model for the inclusive heavy meson production cross section .",
    "the diagrams we need are analogous to the ones of fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] .",
    "the only difference is that the second pair of heavy and light quarks is not fused in the meson .",
    "thus we take into account the resonant part of the spectrum for one quark pair and the continuum for another . to calculate the inclusive production cross section we use the values of parameters which describes the photoproduction of the @xmath5-mesons on the accelerator hera @xcite , as well as in our calculation of the exclusive charmed meson production . to estimate the inclusive production cross section we shall take into account the octet contribution which is absent in the exclusive production . in the case of the photonic inclusive production of @xmath3-mesons",
    "the octet contribution differs from the singlet one only in the general coefficient .",
    "if one use the parameters , from @xcite , then the octet contribution amounts 16% of the total cross section of the @xmath3-meson production .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ sigma_s ] that our predictions for the inclusive production describe l3 experiment data in the order of magnitude ( open circles ) . as our calculations show , the nonzero light quark charge results in the value of ratio @xmath82 differ from unit .",
    "this is valid for the inclusive production too : our calculations show , that the inclusive @xmath83-meson yield approximately twice surpasses the yield of the @xmath84-meson , while the fragmentation model predicts @xmath85 .    at energies larger than 15 gev ( the range where @xmath86-pair produced mainly at large invariant masses )",
    "the total cross section calculated in our model begins to decrease and underestimate the experimental data . in this energy range",
    "it is not enough to consider the resonant contribution ( open triangles ) , and it is necessary to take into account the contribution of continuum ( open squares ) . to calculate the contribution of the continuum we do not fuse now the light quarks with the @xmath32-quarks : @xmath87 . in the conception of structure functions",
    "the considered mechanism means the account of the hadronic structures of the photon .",
    "our approach allow to take into account only a part of the photon structure .",
    "that is why we underestimate the production cross section , and the additional part of the photon structure function is necessary to total value of the cross section .",
    "we expect for the contribution of continuum , that the yields of the charged mesons and neutral ones should be identical .",
    "thus the ratio @xmath82 could serve as a good indication of the production mechanism . the calculations which have been carried out in the works @xcite show that the use of the total structure function allows to describe experimental data well .",
    "in the framework of cqm we have analysed the exclusive production of the heavy mesons in the @xmath60-collisions near the threshold , as well as the inclusive heavy meson production at high energies . near the threshold",
    "we have calculated the relative contribution of the different meson pairs and have found out that the calculation results essentially depends on the electric charge of the light constituent quark .",
    "for zero electric charge of the light quark we obtain , that the production process looks like the heavy quark production followed hadronization according to hqet . at the real values of charges the strong deviation from the predictions of the hqet takes place .",
    "thus , our analysis of the photon - photon production of the heavy meson pairs shows , that the naive conception which is transferred from the @xmath1-annihilation appear not valid . in the processes @xmath64 and @xmath80 the role of the light quarks is essential both in the soft hadronization process and in the hard process of the heavy quark pair production .",
    "unfortunately , in the framework of our model it is impossible to use the same values of constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 to calculate both the exclusive channel and the inclusive one . the use of the values of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which describes process @xmath88 , leads to the large overestimate of the production cross section near the threshold .",
    "we suppose , that such overestimation takes place because the values @xmath15 and @xmath16 effectively account for the contributions from the decays of the excited states , for example , from the decay @xmath54 .",
    "so , these values can not be applied to the case of the exclusive meson production",
    ". nevertheless , our model gives reasonable estimation of the relative contributions into the cross section of the different heavy meson pairs ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) , as well as reasonable predictions of the dependence of the cross section on the interaction energy and the shape of the differential distributions .",
    "also in the framework of the cqm we calculated the cross section of the inclusive charmed meson production in the photon - photon interaction .",
    "the cross section prediction of the inclusive production calculated in the frame work of cqm is in accordance with the experiment data at low energies of the @xmath60-interactions if one choose the parameter values which describes the process @xmath88 at hera @xcite .",
    "it is not unexpected for us because the contribution of the low @xmath97-interaction energies is the most essential for the @xmath5-meson photoproduction at the accelerator hera .",
    "the continuum contribution should increase as a function of the interaction energy .",
    "thus at large energies the character of the calculations should be the same , as in the works @xcite , which explain the cross section increasing for the process @xmath98 with the help of the account for the contribution of the light constituents in the initial photon structure .",
    "the work is supported in part by the grants of rfbr 99 - 02 - 6558 and 00 - 15 - 96645 , the grant of the education ministry of russian federation e00 - 33 - 062 and the grant crdf mo-001 - 0 .",
    "in the given appendix we show how to derive the ratio @xmath68 near the threshold for the heavy meson production in the @xmath1-annihilation , as well as in the @xmath60 - interaction in the approach of the heavy quark effective theory .          in the framework of hqet",
    "the heavy quarks are produced in the @xmath1-annihilation the by means of the virtual photon decay , so , these quarks are in @xmath104 state .",
    "the spin part of the wave function of such state can be expressed through the spinor wave functions of the quarks as follows:@xmath105    thus the light quarks should be in the @xmath106-state .",
    "this state can be obtained in the p - wave as follows:@xmath107 where @xmath108 is the orbital part of the wave function of the light quark pair , and @xmath109 is the spin part of the one:@xmath110        the right part of equation ( [ totalwf ] ) includes the products of the spinor wave functions of the quarks @xmath112 and @xmath113 , which can be expressed through the spin functions of the final mesons:@xmath114 where @xmath70 is the wave function of the pseudoscalar meson;@xmath115              from the equations ( [ vwfplus],[vwfminus],[vpplus],[vpminus ] ) the following expressions for the components of the total wave function ( [ totalwf ] ) can be derived : @xmath121 @xmath122\\bigr ) , \\ ] ] @xmath123 @xmath124\\bigr ) , \\ ] ] @xmath125 @xmath126\\bigr ) .\\ ] ]    as we believe , that the spins of the heavy quark and the light quark do not interact with each other and with the orbital moment , the all term in the right part of the equations ( [ totalplus],[total0],[totalminus ] ) give the identical contributions to the square of the total wave function @xmath127 . the result ( [ eeotn ] )",
    "becomes obvious , because all these terms are orthogonal to each other .    in the case of @xmath60-interactions",

    "the @xmath106-state can be produced in the @xmath131-wave only . since at the threshold",
