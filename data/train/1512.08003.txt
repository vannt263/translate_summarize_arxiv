    "our arguments also apply to the initial value problem with smooth , compactly supported cauchy data posed on a _ two - ended _ hypersurface : in this case , we obtain uniform regularity up to the bifurcate cauchy horizon and the bifurcation sphere .",

    "we point out however that franzen s results apply under assumptions on the decay rate in the exterior region which are less restrictive than what we need for our arguments ; and the techniques used ( based on vector field multipliers ) are rather different than the ones used in the present paper . for the nonlinear einstein vacuum equations ,",

    "our main result therefore provides a rather precise boundedness and regularity result , complementing this blow - up result .",
    "we expect that the @xmath43 loss in the decay rate , mainly caused by the conversion between @xmath44 and @xmath45 decay rates , can be eliminated by using more precise , @xmath45-type besov spaces .",

    "the presence of an asymptotically flat spatial infinity , rather than an asymptotically hyperbolic one as in cosmological spacetimes ( i.e.  in the presence of a cosmological constant @xmath46 ) , causes difficulties in the analysis of the stationary operator @xmath47 near the real axis , and specifically near @xmath48 .",
    "( in fact , it is a precise analysis of the behavior of @xmath49 as @xmath50 which is key to tataru s proof of price s law @xcite . ) however , assuming suitable decay in the exterior region , we can circumvent these difficulties . in the notation of theorem  [ thmintromain ]",
    ", we thus proceed as follows :    _ step 1 .",
    "_ ( see  [ subsecpfloc ] . )",
    "we cut the solution @xmath13 off at a large radius ; the cut - off wave @xmath51 solves @xmath52 , where @xmath53 has the same decay properties as the original @xmath13 .",
    "translating this into @xmath44 spacetime decay gives @xmath54 .",
    "_ step 2.1 .",
    "_ ( see   [ subsecpfmod ] and [ subsecpfsol ] . )",
    "we are now free to modify the spacetime near spatial infinity by adding a cosmological horizon , which eliminates the aforementioned low frequency problems .",
    "we want to use methods of microlocal analysis near the cauchy horizon , using the saddle point structure of the null - geodesic flow in a suitable uniform version of phase space , called b - cotangent bundle , on the compactification of the spacetime at @xmath55 , in the spirit of @xcite ; see figures  [ figintroext ] and [ figpfsolflow ] below .",
    "it is then technically very convenient to extend the spacetime and the wave equation under consideration beyond @xmath6 so that the cauchy horizon itself lies in the interior of the domain on which we solve the thus extended equation .",
    "_ step 2.2 _ we modify the spacetime beyond @xmath6 by adding an ` artificial exterior region , ' including an artificial horizon @xmath56 ; denote the metric of the extended spacetime by @xmath57 .",

    "we will drop @xmath59 in this brief sketch . )",

    ", we have @xmath62 in @xmath23 ; the goal now is to combine this information with precise regularity estimates for @xmath61 at the cauchy horizon to obtain uniform bounds and decay for @xmath61 , and thus for @xmath51 .     at @xmath63 as well as an artificial horizon @xmath56 at @xmath63 , creating an artificial exterior region @xmath64 .",
    "we place complex absorption in the shaded region . in order to have uniqueness for the wave equation in the domain @xmath65 , we place cauchy data at @xmath66 .",

    "_ step 3 . _",
    "( see  [ subsecpfasy ] .",
    ") one shows next that @xmath61 in fact lies in @xmath67 near the cauchy horizon for some ( negative ) @xmath68 ; furthermore , one obtains @xmath67 for _ all _",
    "@xmath68 away from the cauchy horizon .",
    "( we thus show using scattering theory how polynomial decay propagates from the exterior region into the black hole exterior in the ` no - shift region ' in the terminology of @xcite ; this was previously observed by luk @xcite for the schwarzschild black hole . )",
    "using previously known radial point ( microlocal blue - shift ) estimates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  2.1 ) , one can take @xmath69 , @xmath70 , at @xmath6 , which however does not quite give an @xmath45 bound .",
    "( the only issue is regularity across the horizon ; spherical and time derivatives of @xmath61 remain in @xmath71 with the same decay rate . )    _ step 4 . _ ( see  [ subsecpfrad ] . )",
    "the regularity at @xmath6 can be crucially improved using radial point estimates at the cauchy horizon .",
    "the technical heart of the present paper is thus a logarithmic improvement of radial point estimates at the borderline regularity ; see theorem  [ thmradiallogout ] .",
    "( this estimate is conveniently formulated on the compactified spacetime , and makes use of melrose s b - calculus @xcite , both conceptually and technically . )",
    "this allows us to obtain the regularity @xmath72 for @xmath61 at @xmath6 upon giving up an additional @xmath73 of decay .",
    "the sobolev embedding of the space @xmath74 into @xmath75 thus yields the uniform bound for @xmath13 in @xmath76 , @xmath20 , since we have smoothness in @xmath10 and in the spherical variables .",
    "assuming better decay for @xmath37 in the exterior region , we can integrate the analogous result for @xmath37 and obtain the sharper result @xmath77 .    in order to obtain the regularity of @xmath61 with respect to @xmath78 and spherical derivatives , we need to use the precise structure of the spacetime : regularity with respect to @xmath78 follows from the stationarity of the metric",
    ", while regularity in the spherical variables uses spherical symmetry in the reissner ",
    "nordstrm case and hidden symmetries in the kerr case .",
    "namely , in the latter case , we make use of the carter operator , introduced in @xcite and intimately related to the carter tensor @xcite and the carter constant @xcite , and used extensively in the proof of wave decay in the exterior region of slowly rotating kerr spacetimes by andersson and blue @xcite .",
    "since the existence of the carter constant is directly tied to the completely integrable nature of the geodesic flow on kerr , this part of the argument is rather inflexible ; see however remark  [ rmkradialconormal ] for further discussion .",
    "the study of linear scalar waves serves as a toy model for understanding the problem of determinism in einstein s theory of general relativity : charged reissner ",

    "nordstrm and kerr solutions past their cauchy horizons is conjecturally an unstable phenomenon .",
