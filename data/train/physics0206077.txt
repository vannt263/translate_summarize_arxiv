    "the detailed level of the mars simulations is illustrated by figure  [ marsgeom ] , using the example of several 24 gev proton interactions in an inconel band .",
    "figure  [ phadron ] shows the corresponding yield and momentum spectra for all hadrons ; figure  [ ppion ] gives more detailed information for the pions .",
    "several scatter plots to illustrate the distribution in phase space of the produced pions are displayed in figure  [ scatter ] .",
    "the plots are seen to be relatively symmetric in the x and y coordinates , which indicates that any asymmetries due to the band tilt and elliptical beam spot are largely washed out by the large phase space volume occupied by the produced pions .",
    "the yield per proton for positive and negative pions - plus - kaons - plus - muons at 70 cm downstream from the central intersection of the beam with the target was predicted for the kinetic energy range 32@xmath0232  mev that approximates the capture acceptance of the entire cooling channel .",
    "note that the material in the flanges of the i - beam for the inconel and nickel targets was not included in the calculation ; its inclusion might result in a small change in the predicted yield .",
    "table  [ tab : predictions ] summarizes the yield and energy deposition results from the mars calculations .",
    "it includes the several rows of derived results that assume the scenario , taken from section  [ sec : protons ] , of @xmath1 captured pions .",
    "these derived quantities are identified with a superscript `` 3.2 '' and include : the required number of protons per pulse , @xmath2 , the required total proton pulse energy , @xmath3 , the maximum localized energy deposition in the target material and corresponding temperature rise , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "approximately 7% of the proton beam energy is deposited in the target .",
    "detailed 3-dimensional maps of energy deposition densities were generated for input to the dynamic target stress calculations that are discussed in the following section .",
    "24 gev protons .",
    "this is a smaller bunch charge than would be typical for muon colliders ; the distribution of stress values will scale in approximate proportion to the bunch charge unless the material s fatigue strength is exceeded .",

    "the time origin corresponds to the arrival of the proton pulse .",

    ", width=336 ]    , for @xmath6 24 gev protons on a nickel target but for both 50 ns and 100 ns time steps in the ansys simulation .",
    "the reasonable agreement between the two curves suggests that the normal 100 ns step size is adequately short for approximate stress predictions .",
    ", width=336 ]    probably the most critical issue faced in solid - target design scenarios for pion production at neutrino factories or muon colliders is the survivability and long - term structural integrity of solid targets in the face of repeated shock heating . to investigate this , finite element computer simulations of the shock heating stresses",
    "have been conducted using ansys , a commercial package that is widely used for stress and thermal calculations .",
    "the target band geometry was discretised into a 3-dimensional mesh containing approximately 30 000 elements .",
    "this was as fine as the computing capacity and memory allowed and was judged to be adequate for the accurate modeling of shock wave propagation .",
    "the ansys simulations conservatively assumed that the deposited energy is all converted to an instantaneous local temperature rise .",
    "the dynamic stress analyses were preceded by a transient thermal analysis to generate temperature profiles using as input the 3-dimensional energy deposition profiles previously generated by mars for the production assumption of @xmath1 total captured pions ( see the preceding section ) .",
    "dynamic stress calculations were then performed both for a `` free edge '' band , i.e. , with no i - beam flanges , and with a `` fixed edge '' constraint , in which the edges of the band are constrained against displacement in both the radial and axial direction .",
    "the `` free edge '' boundary condition is appropriate for the titanium alloy band ; the `` fixed edge '' model is considered likely to provide an improved approximation to the inconel and nickel bands with their i - beam flanges without requiring the extra computing capacity that would be needed to simulate the more complicated true geometry .    the von mises stress (",
    "i.e. , the deviation from the hydrostatic state of stress ) was found to be initially zero but to develop and fluctuate over time as the directional stresses relax or are reflected from material boundaries .",
    "figure  [ band_vonmises_initial ] gives an example snapshot of the predicted von mises stress distribution at one microsecond after the arrival of a proton pulse , and the remaining figures  [ nick4 ] to  [ nick6 ] show various aspects of the predicted stress at the position of maximum stress , respectively : the time development for 6 gev protons and for all three band material candidates ; the same for 24 gev protons ; superimposed plots for 6 gev and 24 gev protons and for the nickel band ; the stress development over a long enough time - span to see the attenuation of the stress levels ; and a check on the time step used in the ansys calculations .",
    "table  [ tab : predictions ] summarizes the ansys predictions for the maximum stress created at any time and any position in each of the band materials , @xmath7 .",
    "these values were obtained by reading off from figures  [ nick4 ] and  [ nick3 ] and then scaling to the bunch charge for a total yield of @xmath1 captured pions .",
    "the final row of table  [ tab : predictions ] displays the percentage of the fatigue strength ( from table  [ band_materials ] ) that this represents .    for the inconel band ,",
    "the calculated fraction of the fatigue strength that the band would be exposed to in this `` worst case '' proton bunch scenario , 53 - 69% , is either close to or slightly above what could be considered a safe operating margin for the target band .",
    "a more definitive determination of the proton beam parameters that allow survivability and adequate safety margins for this target scenario could be provided by data from the ongoing bnl e951 targetry experiment  @xcite , with planned stress tests for bunched 24 gev proton beams incident on several types of targets , including inconel 718 .",
    "the inconel target may well be appropriate for some proton beam specifications at a muon collider , and it has already been shown  @xcite to likely give a wide safety margin for the more relaxed beam parameters of neutrino factories .    the titanium alloy was predicted to have a very conservative safety margin even for the assumed muon collider beam parameters : only 10 - 14% of the fatigue strength . although the yield is about 20% lower than for the other two candidate materials , target bands from titanium alloys look likely to survive with any proton bunch charges that might reasonably be contemplated for muon colliders .",
    "finally , nickel targets are known to evade the predictions for fatigue strength limits , as already mentioned .",
    "test beam experiments would be required to establish the suitability or otherwise of a nickel band production target for any particular muon collider scenario .",
    "all of the above calculations apply for a circumferentially continuous band .",
    "it remains to check the level of von mises stresses at the gaps between the eight welded band sections , although it is noted that the bnl g-2 target was deliberately segmented longitudinally in order to reduce the beam stresses .",
    "for rotating band targets in muon colliders , additional periodic slots in the webbing may also be considered for thermal stress relief and eddy current reduction in rotating band targets for muon colliders .",
    "in summary , the inconel rotating band target design appears to be a promising option for pion production targets at muon colliders . the design concept appears to be manageable from an engineering point of view , and initial simulations of target yields and stresses are encouraging for each of three candidate target materials : inconel 718 , titanium alloy 6al-4v grade 5 and nickel .",
    "priorities for further evaluation of this target scenario include engineering designs of the components , optimization of the band geometry for pion yield and calibration of the target stress predictions to experimental targetry results .",
