    "in the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , the formation of galaxies is driven by the growth of the large - scale structure of the universe and the formation of dark matter halos .",
    "galaxies form by the cooling and condensation of gas in the centers of the potential wells of extended virialized dark matter halos @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "galaxy properties , such as luminosity or stellar mass , are expected to be tightly coupled to the depth of the halo potential and thus to the halo mass .",
    "there are various different approaches to link the properties of galaxies to those of their halos . a first method attempts to derive the halo properties from the properties of its galaxy population using e.g. galaxy kinematics @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite , or x - ray studies @xcite .",
    "a second approach is to attempt to model the physics that shapes galaxy formation _",
    "ab initio _ using either large numerical simulations including both gas and dark matter @xcite or semi - analytic models ( sams ) of galaxy formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in `` hybrid '' sams ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , dark matter `` merger trees '' are extracted from a dark matter only n - body simulation , and gas processes are treated with semi - analytic recipes .",
    "an advantage of this method is that high - resolution n - body simulations can track the evolution of individual subhalos @xcite and thus provide the precise positions and velocities of galaxies within a halo .",
    "however , many of the physical processes involved in galaxy formation ( such as star formation and various kinds of feedback ) are still not well understood , and in many cases simulations are not able to reproduce observed quantities with high accuracy .    with the accumulation of data from large galaxy surveys over the last decade , a third method has been developed , which links galaxies to halos using a statistical approach .",
    "the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) formalism specifies the probability distribution for a halo of mass @xmath3 to harbour @xmath0 galaxies with certain intrinsic properties , such as luminosity , color , or type ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more complex formulations of this kind of modelling , such as the conditional luminosity function ( clf ) formalism @xcite have extended the hod approach .",
    "these methods have the advantage that they do not rely on assumptions about the ( poorly understood ) physical processes that drive galaxy formation . in this way , it is possible to constrain the relationship between galaxy and halo properties ( and thus , indirectly , the underlying physics ) , and to construct mock catalogs that reproduce in detail a desired observational quantity ( such as the luminosity function ) .",
    "one disadvantage of the classical hod approach was that one had to make assumptions about the distribution of positions and velocities of galaxies within their host halos .",
    "in addition , the results of the hod modelling can be difficult to interpret in terms of the underlying physics of galaxy formation .    in recent years",
    ", hod models have been introduced that make use of information about the positions , velocities and masses of halos and subhalos extracted from a dissipationless n - body simulation .",
    "the ( sub)halo mass is then empirically linked to galaxy properties by requiring that a statistical observational quantity ( e.g. galaxy luminosity function and/or galaxy two - point - correlation - function ) is reproduced .",
    "this is either done by assuming parameterized functions to relate galaxy properties ( such as luminosity ) to halo mass or by assuming a non - parametric monotonic relation .",
    "it has been shown that these simple models reproduce galaxy clustering as a function of luminosity over a wide range in redshift @xcite .",
    "observationally , it is well known that galaxy clustering is a function of spatial scale , galaxy properties ( such as luminosity and type ) , and redshift .",
    "luminous ( massive ) galaxies are more strongly clustered than less luminous ( less massive ) galaxies @xcite .",
    "one can split the galaxy two - point correlation function ( 2pcf ) into two separate parts : the one - halo and the two - halo terms .",
    "the one - halo term , which dominates on small scales , depends strongly on the galaxy distribution within the halo as well as the details of the hod .",
    "the two - halo term , which dominates on scales that are much larger than a typical halo , is proportional to the auto - correlation of the halo population . in general the two terms",
    "are not expected to combine to produce a featureless power - law , but generally show a break or dip at the scale where the transition from the one - halo to the two - halo term occurs @xcite .",
    "the extensive multi - wavelength spectrophotometric information that is now available for large numbers of galaxies allows us to estimate physical parameters of galaxies , such as stellar masses , instead of relying on observational properties such as magnitudes @xcite .",
    "these estimates can even be obtained  with a proper measure of caution  for high redshift galaxies .",
    "stellar mass estimates have been presented in the literature for galaxies up to redshifts as high as @xmath4 @xcite , and stellar mass function estimates have been presented up to @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the goal of our paper is to develop a `` conditional stellar mass function '' ( cmf ) formalism , which is the stellar mass analog of the clf .",
    "the cmf yields the average number of galaxies with stellar masses in the range @xmath6 as a function of the host halo mass @xmath3 and can be regarded as the stellar mass function ( smf ) for halos of mass @xmath3 .",
    "we apply this formalism at low redshift and up to the highest redshifts where reliable observational stellar mass estimates are available ( @xmath7 ) . in this way",
    ", we derive a parameterized relationship between dark matter halo mass and galaxy mass as a function of redshift .    using a parameterized relationship",
    "has several advantages .",
    "first , it provides a convenient way for other researchers to make use of our results and obtain an expression for stellar mass as a function of halo mass .",
    "second , it is straightforward to include scatter in the relation , which is physically more realistic : one just has to choose a number drawn from an assumed random distribution and add that to the average relation .",
    "finally , it is straightforward to treat central and satellite galaxies separately and assume different relations between stellar and halo mass for those populations .",
    "however , here we make the assumption that both populations follow the same relation , which has consequences for the clustering predictions of our model .    using",
    "the cmf derived _ only _ from constraints from the observed smf , we compute the predicted ( projected ) galaxy cf at @xmath8 as a function of stellar mass , and find good agreement with the observational results of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that assuming central and satellite galaxies follow the same relation between stellar and halo mass , adding the clustering constraints does not tighten the constraints on our model parameters ; i.e. , any model that satisfies the mass function constraints will produce the correct clustering . based on this result , we use our redshift - dependent cmf results to _ predict _ the clustering as a function of stellar mass and redshift . to date , observational measurements of clustering as a function of stellar mass have only been published for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "we show that our model predictions agree very well with these measurements",
    ". very soon it will be possible to test our predictions for redshifts beyond @xmath10 with the results from deep wide - field surveys ( e.g. musyc , ukidds , etc ) .",
    "we again present convenient fitting functions for the galaxy bias as a function of both stellar mass and redshift . in a companion paper",
    "we will employ our estimates of galaxy bias in order to compute the `` cosmic variance '' , the uncertainty in observational estimates of the volume density of galaxies arising from the underlying large - scale density fluctuations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ s : simulation ] we describe the @xmath0-body simulation , the halo finding algorithm that was used to obtain a halo catalogue and the treatment of ` orphaned ' galaxies .",
    "section [ s : galaxies ] specifies our model : we motivate the form of the stellar - to - halo mass ( shm ) relation and constrain it by requiring that the observed smf is reproduced .",
    "the clustering properties of galaxies are then inferred from those of the halo population .",
    "we discuss the meaning of the parameters of the shm relation and demonstrate that clustering puts only weak constraints on them .",
    "in section [ s : cmf ] we introduce the cmf , which describes how halos are occupied by galaxies , and compute the occupation numbers .",
    "section [ s : comparison ] gives a comparison between our results and several other models and observations . in section [ s : redshift ] we apply our method to higher redshifts and determine the redshift dependence of the shm relation .",
    "we make predictions of the stellar mass dependent galaxy cf at higher redshift which we use to compute the galaxy bias . finally , we summarize our methods and conclusions in section [ s : conclusions ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we assume a @xmath11cdm cosmology with ( @xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath14,@xmath15,@xmath16 ) = ( @xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath19,@xmath20,@xmath21 ) . we employ a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) and convert all stellar masses to this imf . in order to simplify the notation we will use the capital @xmath3 to denote dark matter halo masses and the lower case @xmath22 to denote galaxy stellar masses .",
    "high - resolution dissipationless n - body simulations have shown that distinct halos contain subhalos which orbit within the potential of their host halo .",
    "these subhalos were distinct halos in the past , and entered the larger halo via merging during the process of hierarchical assembly .",
    "we will refer to the galaxy at the center of a distinct halo as a central galaxy , and the galaxies within subhalos as `` satellites '' , and we will use the term ` halo ' to refer to the distinct halo for central galaxies and to the subhalo in which the galaxy originally formed for satellite galaxies .    _",
    "_ a__b initio models of galaxy formation predict that the stellar mass of a galaxy is tightly correlated with the depth of the potential well of the halo in which it formed . for distinct halos ,",
    "the relevant mass is the virial mass at the time of observation .",
    "subhalos , however , lose mass while orbiting in a larger system as their outer regions are tidally stripped .",
    "stars are centrally concentrated and more tightly bound than the dark matter , however , and so the stellar mass of a galaxy which is accreted by a larger system probably changes only slightly until most of the dark matter has been stripped off .",
    "therefore the subhalo mass at the time of observation is probably not a good tracer for the potential well that shaped the galaxy properties .",
    "a better tracer is the subhalo mass at the time that it was accreted by the host halo , or its maxmimum mass over its history .",
    "this was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "the population of dark matter halos used in this work is drawn from an @xmath0-body simulation run with the simulation code gadget-2 @xcite on a sgi altixii at the university observatory munich .",
    "the cosmological parameters of the simulation are chosen to match results from wmap-3 @xcite for a flat @xmath11cdm cosmological model : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25  km  s@xmath26  mpc@xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the initial conditions were generated using the grafic software package @xcite .",
    "the simulation was done in a periodic box with side length @xmath30 mpc , and contains @xmath31 particles with a particle mass of @xmath32 and a force softening of @xmath33 kpc .",
    "dark matter halos are identified in the simulation using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) halo finder .",
    "substructures inside the fof groups are then identified using the subfind code described in @xcite . for the most massive subgroup in a fof group the virial radius and mass",
    "are determined with a spherical overdensity criterion : the density inside a sphere centered on the most bound particle is required to be greater than or equal to the value predicted by the spherical collapse model for a tophat perturbation in a @xmath11cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , for subhalos we use the maximum mass over its past history , which is typically the mass when the halo was last a distinct halo and did not yet overlap with its later host .",
    "merger trees were constructed out of the halo catalogs at 94 time - steps , equally spaced in expansion factor ( @xmath34 ) , based on the particle overlap of halos at different time - steps .    due to the finite mass resolution of the simulation ( @xmath35 ) , subhalos can no longer be identified when their mass has dropped below this limit due to tidal stripping . since mass loss",
    "can be substantial ( > 90% ) this is important even for fairly massive subhalos .",
    "a special treatment of these so - called `` orphans '' is necessary .",
    "we determine the orbital parameters at the last moment when a subhalo is identified in the simulation and use them in the dynamical friction recipe of @xcite , which is applicable at radii @xmath36 .",
    "we also tried an alternate recipe in which we make no explicit use of the subhalo information , but apply the dynamical friction formula from the time when the satellites first enter the host halo .",
    "we obtained very similar subhalo mass functions and radial distributions with the alternate recipe , confirming the self - consistency of the approach .",
    "for the halo positions in the determination of cfs , we use the coordinates of the most bound particle for distinct and subhalos . for orphans , by definition , the position is not known ,",
    "so we follow the position of the most bound particle from the last time - step when a subhalo was identified . since the dynamical friction force vanishes in the dark matter only simulation after a subhalo",
    "is dissolved , yet not in reality when a galaxy is present at the center of the subhalo , the distance to the center of the host halo might be slightly overestimated with this prescription .",
    "in this section we describe how we derive the relationship connecting the stellar mass of a galaxy to the mass of its dark matter halo . in the standard picture of galaxy formation , gas can only cool and form stars if it is in a virialized gravitationally bound dark matter halo @xcite . in this model",
    "the gas cooling rate , the star formation rate and thus the properties of the galaxy depend mainly on the virial mass of the host halo .",
    "thus we expect the stellar mass of a central galaxy to be strongly correlated with the virial mass of the halo in which the galaxy formed .",
    "as we discussed in the last section , this corresponds to the virial mass for central galaxies , and to the maximum mass over the halo s history for satellite galaxies . in the rest of this work ,",
    "unless noted otherwise , the halo mass @xmath3 will represent : @xmath37    note that we have also experimented with instead using the present mass for subhalos , and found that we were not able to reproduce the galaxy clustering properties ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in order to link the stellar mass of a galaxy @xmath22 to the mass of its dark matter halo @xmath3 we need to specify the shm ratio .",
    "a direct comparison of the halo mass function @xmath38 and the galaxy mass function @xmath39 helps to constrain the stellar - to - halo mass function .",
    "if we assume that every host ( sub ) halo contains exactly one central ( satellite ) galaxy and that each system has exactly the same shm ratio @xmath40 , the galaxy stellar mass function can be derived trivially from the halo mass function and has the same features . the galaxy mass function derived for @xmath41 is compared to the observed sdss galaxy mass function in figure [ f : fig1 ] .",
    "the observed galaxy mass function is steeper for high masses and shallower for low masses than the one derived from the halo mass function .",
    "thus , for a constant shm ratio there will inevitably be too many galaxies at the low and high mass end .",
    "this implies that the actual shm ratio @xmath40 is not constant , but increases with increasing mass , reaches a maximum around @xmath42 and then decreases again .",
    "hence we adopt the following parametrization , similar to the one used in @xcite : @xmath43^{-1 } \\label{eqnmmap}\\ ] ] it has four free parameters : the normalization of the stellar - to - halo mass ratio @xmath44 , a characteristic mass @xmath45 , where the shm ratio is equal to @xmath44 , and two slopes @xmath46 and @xmath47 which indicate the behavior of @xmath40 at the low and high mass ends respectively .",
    "we use the same parameters for the central and satellite populations , since  unlike luminosity  the stellar mass of satellites changes only slightly after they are accreted by the host halo .",
    "note that though both @xmath46 and @xmath47 are expected to be positive , they are not restricted to be so .",
    "the shm relation is therefore not necessarily monotonic .",
    "having set up the model we now need to constrain the four free parameters @xmath45 , @xmath44 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . to do this , we populate the halos in the simulation with galaxies .",
    "the stellar masses of the galaxies depend on the mass of the halo and are derived according to our prescription ( equation [ eqnmmap ] ) .",
    "the positions of the galaxies are given by the halo positions in the @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "once the simulation box is filled with galaxies , it is straightforward to compute the smf @xmath48 . as we want to fit this model mass function to the observed mass function @xmath49 by @xcite",
    ", we choose the same stellar mass range ( @xmath50 ) and the same binsize .",
    "the observed smf was derived using spectra from the sloan digital sky survey data release 3 ( sdss dr3 ) ; see @xcite for a description of the method .",
    "furthermore it is possible to determine the stellar mass dependent clustering of galaxies . for this",
    "we compute projected galaxy cfs @xmath51 in several stellar mass bins which we choose to be the same as in the observed projected galaxy cfs of @xcite .",
    "these were derived using a sample of galaxies from the sdss dr2 with stellar masses estimated from spectra by @xcite .",
    "we first calculate the real space cf @xmath52 . in a simulation",
    "this can be done by simply counting pairs in distance bins : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of pairs counted in a distance bin and @xmath55 where @xmath0 is the total number of galaxies in the box .",
    "the projected cf @xmath56 can be derived by integrating the real space correlation function @xmath52 along the line of sight : @xmath57 where the comoving distance ( @xmath58 ) has been decomposed into components parallel ( @xmath59 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath60 ) to the line of sight .",
    "the integration is truncated at @xmath61  mpc . due to the finite size of the simulation box ( @xmath62  mpc )",
    "the model correlation function is not reliable beyond scales of @xmath63  mpc .    in order to fit the model to the observations we use powell s directions set method in multidimensions ( e.g. press et al .",
    "1992 ) to find the values of @xmath45 , @xmath44 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 that minimize either @xmath64 ( mass function fit ) or @xmath65 ( mass function and projected cf fit ) with @xmath66 and @xmath67 the number of data points for the smf and projected cfs , respectively , and @xmath68 the number of mass bins for the projected cfs .    in this context @xmath69 and @xmath70",

    "note that for the simultaneous fit , by adding the reduced @xmath74 , we give the same weight to both data sets .      in order to obtain estimates of the errors on the parameters , we need their probability distribution prob(@xmath75 ) , where @xmath76 is the parameter under consideration and @xmath77 is the given background information .",
    "the most likely value of @xmath76 is then given by : @xmath78 .    as we have to assume that all our parameters are coupled",
    ", we can only compute the probability for a given set of parameters .",
    "this probability is given by : @xmath79 in a system with four free parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 one can calculate the probability distribution of one parameter ( e.g. @xmath76 ) if the probability distribution for the set of parameters is known , using marginalization : @xmath82    once the probability distribution for a parameter is determined , one can assign errors based on the confidence intervals .",
    "this is the shortest interval that encloses a certain percentage @xmath83 of the area under the posterior probability distribution .",
    "for the 1-sigma error @xmath84 while for the 2-sigma error @xmath85 . assuming that the probability distribution has been normalized to have unit area we seek @xmath86 and @xmath87 such that    @xmath88    finally the parameter @xmath76 is given as @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the errors derived in this way only include sources that have been considered when computing @xmath92 .",
    "the calculation of the errors applies for uncorrelated data points . since in our case",

    "using the approach described above we also compute the errors on the parameters .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ t : mfresults ] .",
    "having derived the best - fit parameters , we can predict the projected cfs .",
    "we present the results both including and not including orphan galaxies , where we have fitted to the smf for each case .",
    "figure [ f : fig2 ] shows a comparison between our model and the sdss projected correlation functions in five stellar mass bins ranging from @xmath96 to @xmath97 with a binsize of @xmath98 .",
    "the correlation function that has been derived without orphans is too low at small scales and can be regarded as a lower limit . neglecting these galaxies results in an underprediction of satellite galaxy clustering . as on small scales",
    "the projected cf depends mainly on the one - halo term this results in the underprediction of @xmath56 .",
    "this effect weakens for the clustering of more massive galaxies as they are more likely to be central galaxies and thus not effected by tidal stripping at all .",
    "the agreement with the observationally derived @xmath56 for the catalogue including orphaned galaxies is very good , which is also reflected in the low value of @xmath99 .",
    "note that this value has been calculated with the parameters from the mass function fit given above and does not correspond to a fit to the projected cfs .",
    "note that we plot the projected cfs only up to @xmath100 . because of the finite box size , the clustering of host halos and thus central galaxies is underpredicted at large scales independent of mass",
    ". additionally , due to the lack of long - wavelength modes , massive halos and galaxies can be underproduced leading to an underprediction of @xmath101 for the massive objects , independent of scale .",
    "however , the latter effect is very small , since the abundance of the massive halos in our simulation agrees very well with the predicted average @xcite .    as a test we also used the present mass instead of the maximum mass for subhalos .",
    "we then found that the projected cf was underpredicted particularly on small scales .",
    "this effect is due to tidal stripping of subhalos and is thus strongest at small scales where the subhalo contribution dominates .",
    "we now investigate whether we can improve the agreement between the model and the observed projected cfs by performing a combined fit as described above .",
    "we obtain the same parameters as those we derived from the fit to the smf alone .",
    "this seems surprising , but on further inspection we find that this is due to @xmath102 being a lot more sensitive to changes of the parameters than @xmath70 .",
    "this means that if one changes the parameters a little in order to improve the fit to the projected correlation functions , one can get a slightly better agreement between the model and the observed projected cfs only at the cost of a large disagreement between the model and the observed stellar mass functions . in other words : @xmath70 is much flatter around its minimum than @xmath70 , as shown in figure [ f : fig3 ] .",
    "this means that , assuming that both central and satellite galaxies follow the same shm relation , the model that matches the smf can reproduce the correct clustering .",
    "however , if subhalos have a different shm ratio there is an infinite number of solutions that match the smf but produce very different correlation functions .",
    "the only way to constrain the shm relations then is to take the clustering data into account . by adopting different shm relations for central and satellite populations",
    "it is even possible to produce a slightly better fit to the correlation functions @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , if one wants to _ predict _ clustering as a function of stellar mass ( e.g. at higher redshift ) then one has to make an assumption about how the shm ratios of central and satellite galaxies are related .",
    "we made the very simple assumption , that the relation between the stellar mass of central galaxies and the virial mass of their host halo and the relation between the stellar mass of satellite galaxies and the mass of the subhalo at the time of accretion is the same , and have shown that this leads to very good predictions for the mass dependent clustering .",
    "we conclude that under this simple assumption we can use our model to predict clustering as a function of stellar mass .",
    "[ f : fig4 ]    the upper panel of figure [ f : fig4 ] shows the derived stellar mass as a function of halo mass . the light shaded area gives the 68% confidence interval while the dark and light shaded areas together give the 95% confidence interval .",
    "these have been derived using a set of different models computed on a mesh , as described in ",

    "we apply the same procedure .",

[ ratio ] if we keep @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 fixed and only vary @xmath44 , this corresponds to changing the stellar mass of the galaxy that lives inside each halo by a constant factor .",
    "this has no impact on the form of the smf .",
    "its shape stays the same , while only the position on the stellar mass axis changes . due to the monotonic form of the smf this",

    "[ m1 ] varying only @xmath45 we find that the shape of the smf changes drastically .",
    "for a higher @xmath45 than our best fit value , we get too many massive galaxies and too few low mass galaxies , while for a lower value of @xmath45 we get too few massive galaxies and too many low mass galaxies .",
    "this is because @xmath45 is the characteristic mass corresponding to the highest shm ratio . in the smf",
    ", this corresponds to the knee and we get a smf which has its knee at the stellar mass corresponding to @xmath45 . for a larger @xmath45 the knee is shifted to a higher stellar mass .",

    "the two slopes are in very good agreement with our results",
    ". however , the normalization in the @xcite sam is @xmath229 higher and the characteristic mass is @xmath229 lower than what we found and what @xcite find for their model .",
    "this is because the sam of @xcite does not produce a perfect fit to the observed smf .",
    "another direct way of studying galaxy properties as a function of halo mass is using the sdss group catalogue presented in @xcite . in this approach",
    ", galaxies are first linked together into `` groups '' using a friends - of - friends algorithm .",
    "each group is then assigned a total halo mass by matching to the theoretical dark matter halo mass function . @xcite",
    "present the relation between the mean stellar mass of the central galaxy and the host halo mass .",
    "we fit the parameters of equation [ eqnmmap ] to their relation and present the results in table  [ t : paracomparison ] .",
    "we note that the characteristic mass and the normalization derived from the group catalogue are both higher than our model parameters .",
    "the high mass slope of the shm relation in the group catalogue is shallower than that of our model .",
    "the low mass slope is also shallower , however , the constraints on the low mass slope in the group catalogue are weak , since the lowest halo masses are @xmath230 .",
    "this can also be seen in figure  [ f : fig11 ] where we show the shm relation of the group catalogue for comparison .",
    "the discussion in the previous sections has focussed solely on the present day universe . in this section",
    "we extend our analysis to higher redshifts and derive the redshift dependence of the stellar - to - halo mass relation . having chosen a particular observed stellar mass function at a given redshift , we can investigate how the parameters of the shm ratio change with time .",
    "this allows us to learn about the evolution of galaxies .",
    "also , with this information , we can populate the @xmath0-body simulation snapshots with galaxies at different redshifts using the appropriate redshift dependent shm relation , and then use the spatial information from the simulation to compute the stellar mass dependent correlation functions .",
    "since at the present time there are no high redshift ( @xmath231 ) clustering data as a function of stellar mass available , we fit the four parameters of equation to the observed smfs at a given redshift .",
    "we argued in section [ combinedfit ] that , under the assumption that central and satellite galaxies follow the same shm relation , the smfs provide much stronger constraints on the shm ratio than the clustering data .",
    "thus we should be able to use our model to predict clustering as a function of stellar mass at any redshift .      in order to constrain the shm relation we have to first select observational stellar mass functions at the redshifts we want to investigate . because of the trade - off between surveying large areas and obtaining deep samples , measurements of the smf at high redshift tend to suffer from limited dynamic range .",
    "therefore it is important to think about how the constraints on our four shm function parameters arise from the observations .",
    "the characteristic mass @xmath45 and the maximum shm ratio @xmath44 mostly depend on galaxies and halos of intermediate mass .",
    "the high mass slope @xmath47 is fixed by the number of massive galaxies since these live in the massive halos . on the other hand ,",
    "the low mass slope @xmath46 is set by the number of low mass galaxies since these live in the low mass halos .    for a survey with a fixed area on the sky ,",
    "the observed volume is smaller for low redshifts @xmath232 than for high redshifts . in order to compute the smf at high galaxy masses , the observed volume has to be relatively large , as massive galaxies are rare .",
    "thus for low redshifts one has to choose a wide survey ( large area ) to determine the smf for massive galaxies and properly constrain @xmath47 .",
    "constraining the smf at the low mass end requires a high level of completeness for low mass galaxies , which are very faint objects .",
    "hence we have to choose a deep survey that can detect faint galaxies in order to constrain @xmath46 .    taking these considerations into account",
    ", we choose the stellar mass functions presented in @xcite to constrain the parameters @xmath45 , @xmath44 and @xmath47 at low redshifts .",
    "the authors derive the smfs using munics which is a wide area , medium - deep survey selected in the @xmath233 band .",
    "the detection limit is @xmath234 and the subsample the authors use covers @xmath235 .",
    "we apply our method using these mass functions and take the three parameters from that analysis .    however , the munics survey is not deep enough to detect galaxies that are fainter than the characteristic mass of the smf ( the knee ) and thus is not sufficient to constrain the parameter @xmath46 . to constrain @xmath46 we choose",
    "the smfs derived in @xcite .",
    "this work is based on the goods - music sample , a multicolor catalogue extracted from the survey conducted over the chandra deep field south .",
    "the catalogue is selected in the @xmath236 and @xmath233 bands , covers an area of @xmath237 , and is complete to a typical magnitude of @xmath238 .",
    "we apply our method using the smfs computed with the @xmath236 band selected sample and take the parameter @xmath46 from that analysis .    for high redshift",
    "@xmath239 we use the smfs presented in @xcite to constrain all four parameters . for high redshifts , the volume of a redshift bin becomes large enough to sample massive galaxies , and",
    "therefore the goods - music sample is sufficient to constrain @xmath47 .",
    "we convert all smfs which use a salpeter initial mass function to the kroupa / chabrier initial mass function .",

    "the low mass slope @xmath46 seems to increase with redshift until @xmath241 and then drops to a low value .",

    "we therefore assume that @xmath46 grows with increasing redshift .",
    "as we explained in section  [ beta ] , @xmath46 is strongly related to the parameter @xmath105 of the schechter function .",
    "a small value of @xmath46 corresponds to a large absolute value of @xmath105 while a large value of @xmath46 results in a low absolute value of @xmath105 .",

    "the zcosmos clustering amplitude agrees very well with the model for @xmath262 , but for @xmath263 deviates at larger distances and becomes higher than the prediction . as suggested by @xcite",
