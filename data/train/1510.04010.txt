    "overwhelming evidence has indicated that our universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion , and this surprising observation can be accounted for by a modification of the theory of general relativity on the cosmic scale ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) , or the existence of an exotic energy component with negative pressure , called dark energy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "popular candidates for dark energy include the cosmological constant  @xcite and some dynamical scalar fields , such as quintessence  @xcite , phantom  @xcite and quintom  @xcite , etc .",
    ", which couple minimally with gravity . more generally , one may also assume a nonminimal coupling between the scalar field dark energy and gravity , which can be generated naturally when quantum corrections are considered and are essential for the renormalizability of the scalar field theory in curved space .",
    "when a normal scalar field is assumed to couple with the curvature scalar defined in the metric formalism , the resulting dark energy is called extended quintessence  @xcite , and it is in fact a special case of the scalar - tensor theories  @xcite . recently , by replacing the curvature scalar defined in the metric formalism with that in the palatini formalism , we proposed a new extended quintessence in ref .",
    "it is worth noting that , in the general relativity limit , two different metric formalisms give the same field equations  @xcite .",
    "however , once gravity is modified , they lead to different results .    in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we studied the linear cosmological perturbations of the extended quintessence in both the metric and palatini formalisms .",
    "we found that in the palatini formalism the value of the gravitational potential of the extended quintessence is always smaller than that of the minimal coupling case .",
    "this is different from what happens in the metric formalism where the gravitational potential is less than that in the minimal coupling case when the coupling constant is positive , while it is larger if the coupling constant is negative .",
    "the expressions of the effective newton s constant in the metric and palatini formalisms are different .",
    "a negative coupling constant enhances the gravitational interaction , while a positive one weakens it .",
    "we also found that the metric and palatini formalisms give different linear growth rates , but the difference is very small , and current observation can not distinguish them effectively .    in the present work ,",
    "we plan to investigate the nonlinear structure formation of the extended quintessence in the metric and palatini formalisms by using the spherical collapse method .",
    "spherical collapse is a semianalytical method often used to evolve structures by following perturbations into the nonlinear region  @xcite . in this method",
    ", perturbations are assumed to be spherically symmetric nonrotating objects .",
    "since perturbations will be overdense under the attractive action of gravity , the spherically symmetric objects will decouple from the background hubble expansion , reach a point of maximum expansion ( turnaround ) and finally collapse to a singularity .",
    "however , the final singular phase does not happen , since the kinetic energy associated with the collapse is converted into random motions , creating a virialized equilibrium structure .",
    "the spherical collapse method has been used in different cosmological models , including @xmath0cdm  @xcite , quintessence  @xcite , quintessence with an interaction between it and dark matter  @xcite , extended quintessence  @xcite , k - essence  @xcite , and so on .",
    "it has been found that the spherical collapse model is very successful in reproducing results of n - body simulations  @xcite , which are the best ways to investigate the structure formation .",
    "besides the extended quintessence , we also consider the @xmath0cdm and minimally coupled quintessence models .",
    "detailed comparisons among these models are given , including the equation of state of dark energy , the evolutions of the energy density of dark energy and the hubble parameter , and the nonlinear structure formation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we show the background cosmological models considered here .",

    "iii , and the spherical collapses are analyzed in sec .",

    "<S> this indicates that , in the extended quintessence cosmological models in which the coupling constant is negative , all quantities dependent on @xmath1 or @xmath2 are essentially unaffected if the linear density contrast or the virial overdensity of the @xmath0cdm model is used as an approximation . </S>",
