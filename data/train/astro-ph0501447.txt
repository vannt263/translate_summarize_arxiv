    "right out to the highest redshifts so far identified , radio galaxies are the most massive systems at each epoch .",
    "they reside in regions of over - density @xcite , corroborating evolutionary models which trace high redshift radio galaxies ( @xmath10 ; hzrgs ) through to nearby central dominant elliptical galaxies in cluster - type environments ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "unlike their nearby counterparts , however , hzrgs are not massive ellipticals with old stellar populations . instead",
    ", their rest - frame optical / uv morphologies are composed of multiple blobs of clumpy emission often aligned along the axis of relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "rest frame far infra - red observations are strongly suggestive of large - scale , massive , dust - obscured star formation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , hzrgs are often enshrouded by massive gas reservoirs which extend over tens of kpc , traced both by lyman-@xmath11 halos @xcite and by carbon monoxide ( ) line emission @xcite .",
    "each of these properties is consistent with the scenario where the galaxies are being observed in their formative stages .",
    "it is essential , therefore , that the characteristics of the hzrg population are investigated in detail in order to further our understanding of galaxy , and cluster , formation and evolution . in this letter",
    "we report the detection of molecular gas at @xmath0 in tn  j09242201 , the highest redshift radio galaxy and the second highest redshift detection to date , after the @xmath12 quasar sdss  j1148 + 5251 @xcite .",
    "where necessary we use a flat @xmath13-dominated cosmology with @xmath14  km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 and @xmath15 @xcite . in this cosmology , @xmath16  kpc at @xmath0 .",
    "tn  j09242201 was initially discovered @xcite from radio surveys using the well established technique for finding hzrgs of selecting ultra - steep spectrum sources with faint k - band counterparts ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "follow - up optical spectroscopy detected faint lyman-@xmath11 emission from the host galaxy at a redshift of @xmath17 @xcite . based on its compact ( @xmath18 ) radio morphology , under - luminous lyman-@xmath11 emission compared with other hzrgs and rest frame 350  nm emission composed of several clumpy optical features",
    ", it was suggested that tn  j09242201 is a young , primeval galaxy actively forming the bulk of its stars @xcite .",
    "we initially chose tn  j09242201 as a candidate for observations because , as the most distant known member of a sample of hzrgs , it is presumably one of the youngest @xcite",
    ". the existence of molecular gas would provide independent evidence for ongoing massive star formation , expected if we are probing its formation epoch .",
    "the southern declination ( @xmath19 ) of this source makes observations from millimetre telescopes in the northern hemisphere difficult , and its redshift moves all transitions out of any very large array ( vla ) band .",
    "we used the new wide bandwidth 1.2  cm and 3  mm receivers on the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) to search for ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 5 - 4 ) with @xmath20  ghz and @xmath21  ghz , respectively .",
    "observations were carried out with the atca during 2004 august and september .",
    "the atca is an array of six 22-m antennas with baselines ranging from 30  m to 6  km and capable of east - west , north - south and hybrid array configurations .",
    "we utilised the maximum available bandwidth of the current correlator with 128  mhz/64 channel configurations for two adjacent if bands .",
    "the spectral resolution of this configuration is 4.4  mhz . for the ( 1 - 0 ) observations",
    ", we used the hybrid h  168 array , or @xmath22  kpc . ] , tuning the ifs to 18.561 and 18.631  ghz respectively , allowing an overlap region ( after bandpass correction ) of 20  mhz .",
    "this setup benefited from a simultaneous velocity coverage of @xmath23  km  s@xmath2  and resolution of 72  km  s@xmath2  .",
    "system temperatures ranged from 3050  k and phase stability was within @xmath24 over the course of the observations .",
    "phase , amplitude , bandpass and astrometric calibration were acquired by short observations of pks  b0919260 every 1225 minutes depending on the weather .",
    "absolute flux density calibration was ensured by snapshot observations of mars .",
    "we estimate the calibration to be accurate to better than @xmath25 .",
    "the observational setup was repeated in the h  75 array , or @xmath26  kpc . ] with the ifs tuned to 92.853 and 92.921  ghz respectively for the ( 5 - 4 ) transition .",
    "system temperatures ( measured once per hour using a 300  k mechanical paddle moved over the feedhorn ) ranged from 200350  k and phase stability was mostly within @xmath27 over the course of the observations . phase and amplitude calibration were based on observations of pks  b0834201 every 12 minutes and the bandpass was determined by 10  minute observations of either pks  b1253055 or pks  b0537441 . the rms error in the pointing ranged from @xmath28 depending on the antenna ( the primary beam at 93  ghz is @xmath29 ) .",
    "we periodically observed the 0.5  jy quasar pks  b0925203 , less than @xmath30 from tn  j09242201 , to verify the calibration and astrometry .",
    "we estimate the flux scale to be accurate to better than @xmath31 .",
    "data reduction was carried out in accordance with standard atca calibration procedures for millimetre observing .",
    "overall , @xmath32 hours and @xmath33 hours of observing time were employed at 18.6  ghz and 92.9  ghz respectively to carry out this detection experiment .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] gives a summary of our results .",
    "the ( 1 - 0 ) line is detected in at least five independent channels covering @xmath34  km  s@xmath2  and shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we subtracted a 0.71  mjy continuum in the uv plane using a first order spectral baseline fit .",
    "the continuum image is shown in greyscale in figure  [ fig3 ] . the velocity - integrated , continuum - subtracted , flux density is @xmath35  jy  beam@xmath2  km  s@xmath2  and the corresponding intrinsic line luminosity is @xmath36  k  km  s@xmath2pc@xmath37 .",
    "there are two kinematic features apparent in the spectrum : the brighter , dominant , emission centred at @xmath38  km  s@xmath2  ( @xmath39 ) and a weaker feature lying @xmath40  km  s@xmath2  redward .",
    "deeper observations are required to determine if the weaker feature is real . as commonly observed , the lies redward of the lyman-@xmath11 derived redshift ( see table 1 in @xcite ) .",
    "there is no conclusive evidence for spatially extended gas , but the velocity - integrated emission ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) appears to be offset to the north of the radio galaxy by @xmath7 ( @xmath6  kpc ) . at this stage",
    "we do not consider this offset to be significant , since it is much less than a beam size away from the radio galaxy position .",
    "for comparison , the position angle of the projected radio axis is @xmath41 ( see figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "deeper observations with higher spatial resolution are required to better constrain the spatial extent of this gas .",
    "at 93  ghz our instantaneous velocity coverage was only @xmath42  km  s@xmath2  with a spectral resolution of 15  km  s@xmath2  .",
    "the resultant spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig1 ] and the emission profile integrated from 0 to 300 km  s@xmath2  is shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "although the zero level in the profile is well determined from offset positions in the image , our bandwidth is only marginally wider than the line width , so we have to consider the possibility of a spectral baseline offset due to continuum emission from the radio galaxy .",
    "however , the flux density we observe is more than 100 times that expected from the continuum .",
    "this is illustrated by the radio to sub - millimetre spectral energy distribution shown in figure  [ fig4 ] . extrapolating the non - thermal synchrotron spectrum with a spectral index of @xmath43",
    ", we expect a contribution of @xmath44 mjy whilst extrapolating from the 352  ghz scuba limit assuming a modified blackbody spectrum with @xmath45 and t=50  k , the expected contribution due to thermal dust radiation is @xmath46 mjy .",
    "the most likely source of the 93  ghz emission is therefore the redshifted ( 5 - 4 ) transition at @xmath47 .",
    "the velocity - integrated flux density is @xmath48  jy  beam@xmath2  km  s@xmath2  , corresponding to @xmath49  k  km  s@xmath2  pc@xmath37 .",
    "again , the emission appears offset from the radio galaxy position , the peak lying @xmath9 ( @xmath8  kpc ) south .",
    "again , the positional offset is less than a beam size .",
    "deeper observations are required to constrain the spatial extent of the molecular gas , including whether there are physically distinct gas emitting regions .",
    "observations are translated into total h@xmath50 mass estimates , assuming that the observed traces molecular clouds on large scales and that the molecular gas mass dominates the total dynamical mass of the galaxy .",
    "these mass estimates are uncertain at best , but to facilitate comparison with observations from other hzrgs , we assume m@xmath51 m@xmath52  ( k  km  s@xmath2  pc@xmath53)@xmath2 as measured for nearby ultraluminous infra - red galaxies @xcite . since molecular clouds provide both the fuel and the site for the next generation of star formation , our result implies that there is @xmath54  m@xmath52  of available gas from which to manufacture the next stellar generation .",
    "this estimate is consistent with m@xmath55 estimates of other hzrgs like 4c  60.07 @xcite and b3  j2330 + 3927 @xcite .",
    "there is no direct evidence to indicate that tn  j09242201 is gravitationally lensed .",
    "however , if lensing is important then @xmath56 , and hence m@xmath55 , are upper limits only",
    ".      the ratio of the peak flux densities would be equal to the square of the ratio of the upper transition levels ( 1/25 ) in the event that both lines are optically thick and thermally excited . under the assumption of optically thick gas ,",
    "the ratio we measure is 1/(@xmath57 ) , which suggests the ( 5 - 4 ) transition is sub - thermal ; however , the errors are large .",
    "we have used a standard single - component large velocity gradient ( lvg ) code , with a typical co - to - h@xmath50 abundance x[co]/(dv / dr)=@xmath58  ( km  s@xmath2  ) @xmath2  pc , to further constrain the physical properties of the molecular gas . a good match to the observations is given by log(n(h@xmath59 ( where n(h@xmath50 ) is measured in units of @xmath60 ) , t@xmath61  k and r@xmath62  kpc , but other density / temperature combinations are also consistent with the observed fluxes ( see figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "observations of transitions higher than ( 5 - 4 ) are required to constrain the excitation conditions of the gas .",
    "if the observed offsets between the ( 1 - 0 ) and ( 5 - 4 ) transitions reflect physically distinct emitting regions , then the excitation conditions presented here become invalid .",
    "[ lvg ]      at present , the most efficient technique for detecting high redshift molecular gas is to pre - select the dustiest objects , as determined from their large rest frame far - infra red luminosities using ( sub)millimetre sensitive instruments like scuba on the jcmt or mambo on the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "this also means that current samples are biased towards objects with the largest dust - to - gas ratios ( @xmath63 l@xmath52  k@xmath2  km@xmath2  s  pc@xmath64 ; @xcite ) . for comparison ,",
    "the median ratio is 160 for nearby ultra - luminous infra red galaxies with @xmath65 l@xmath52  @xcite and about 50 for nearby luminous infra red galaxies with @xmath66l@xmath52  @xmath67l@xmath52  @xcite .",
    "the selection bias at high redshift is further compounded by the fact that initial detections are usually made in @xmath68 order lines , which prejudices the sample against regions of low density molecular gas where the higher order transitions are sub - thermally excited .",
    "five of the six published detections of hzrgs constitute the most fir - luminous @xmath69 radio galaxies recently surveyed with scuba @xcite . in this sample , approximately 50% of the 24 observed galaxies",
    "were not detected ; tn  j09242201 featured amongst these non - detections with @xmath70  w  hz@xmath2 , five times underluminous compared to the detected hzrgs in the sample .",
    "therefore , tn  j09242201 will have a dust - to - gas ratio at least five times smaller than the current sample of high redshift galaxies , similar to the nearby luminous infra - red galaxy population .",
    "the only other emitter at high redshift not selected on the basis of fir emission  that we are aware of  is 53w002 at @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "this source has a @xmath72 upper limit of 4.3  mjy at 850@xmath73 m @xcite , corresponding to @xmath74  w  hz@xmath2 .",
    "an a posteriori detection of the dust content in 53w002 ( @xmath75 mjy at 1.3  mm ; @xcite ) suggests that a similar observation of tn  j09242201 may also reveal its dust content .",
    "thus 53w002 and tn  j09242201 may be representative of a population of high redshift sources which remain undetected due to current selection techniques .",
    "at @xmath0 the universe is only about a billion years old  time enough , however , to build a supermassive black hole , trigger powerful radio jets and produce a stellar population capable of enriching the interstellar medium with @xmath76 m@xmath52  of ( assuming an abundance of relative to h@xmath50 of @xmath77 ) .",
    "this rapid enrichment could be facilitated in part by the powerful radio jets themselves propagating into overdensities in the primordial gas , and shock - inducing massive star formation @xcite.@xcite recently postulated that tn  j09242201 resides within a protocluster environment after discovering six lyman-@xmath11 emitters in a @xmath78 field ( @xmath79  mpc ) around the radio galaxy  the typical scale size for nearby rich clusters @xcite .",
    "our observations substantiate a five - year old hypothesis that tn  j09242201 is a young forming galaxy , potentially the primeval central dominant galaxy of a rich cluster .",
    "thus it seems that cds may form with their host environments from the earliest times in the universe .",
    "big thanks go to everyone who made the 12 and 3  mm atca upgrades possible .",
