    "the tenth cambridge survey ( 10c ; @xcite ) at 15.7  ghz is the deepest high frequency ( @xmath3 ghz ) radio survey to date , complete to 1  mjy in ten different fields covering a total of @xmath4 .",
    "a further @xmath5 , contained within these fields , is complete to 0.5  mjy .",
    "the 10c survey therefore enables us to study the faint source population at 15.7  ghz , a parameter space which has not been explored in any detail .",
    "most studies of the sub - mjy population have focused on lower frequencies , due to the increased time required to survey a field to an equivalent depth at higher frequencies .",
    "one area of particular interest has been the variation with flux density of the spectral index distribution for the samples selected at 15  20 ghz .",
    "for example ,",
    "in the ninth cambridge survey ( 9c ; @xcite ) the proportion of sources with flat or rising spectra decreased as the flux density decreased .",
    "the median spectral index between 15.2 and 1.4  ghz ( @xmath6 ) changed from 0.23 for the highest flux density bin ( @xmath7 100 mjy ) to 0.79 for the lowest flux density bin ( 5.5 mjy @xmath8 25 mjy ) .",
    "( the convention @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is flux density at frequency @xmath11 , is used throughout this work ) .    the australia telescope 20 ghz survey ( at20 g ; @xcite ) found a similar variation of spectral index with flux density for a sample with a flux density limit of 40  mjy .",
    "the 10c survey @xcite enables us to extend these studies to lower flux densities .",
    "although the study by @xcite contains a larger number of limits , it is clear that the fraction of flat spectrum sources increases again as flux density decreases further .",
    "there have been several attempts to model the high frequency radio sky ( @xcite , @xcite , , ) .",
    "these simulations have extrapolated from lower frequency surveys , generally on the assumption that the sources have power - law synchrotron spectra .",
    "these models are an increasingly poor fit to the observed sources counts below 10  mjy at 15  ghz .",
    "the number of sources is significantly underestimated , indicating that the properties of these sources are not well understood , largely due to the complexity and diversity of the high frequency spectra of individual sources . to understand the nature of the faint ,",
    "high frequency population and constrain the models better , a multifrequency study is required . in this paper",
    "we describe just such a study , examining the radio properties of a sub - sample of 10c sources in the lockman hole , a region which has been observed over a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "the lockman hole is a region of the sky centred near 10@xmath1245@xmath13 , + 58@xmath14 ( j2000 coordinates , which are used throughout this work ) with exceptionally low hi column density @xcite . the low infrared background",
    "( 0.38 mjy  sr@xmath15 at 100  @xmath16 m ; @xcite ) in this area of the sky makes it ideal for infrared observations . as a result , as part of the spitzer wide - area infrared extragalactic survey ( swire ; @xcite ) sensitive infrared observations of @xmath1 14 deg@xmath17 of the lockman hole area have been made .",
    "the availability of deep infrared observations in the lockman hole has triggered deep observing campaigns at optical , x - ray and radio wavelengths .",
    "the availability of data at such a wide range of frequencies makes the lockman hole a particularly good area for study . here",
    ", the radio properties of sources detected in the 10c survey at 15.7  ghz in the lockman hole are investigated .",
    "the 10c data are combined with those from deep surveys at 610 mhz made with the giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ; @xcite ) and at 1.4  ghz made with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ; @xcite ) , along with other available data over a range of radio frequencies .",
    "the surveys used are described in more detail in section [ section : samples ] along with the process for matching them to the 10c catalogue .",
    "section [ section : source - parameters ] describes how the parameters of the 10c sources are investigated using these surveys , including calculating the radio spectral indices and investigating the extent of the radio emission .",
    "the data are analysed and the properties of the 10c sources are discussed in section [ section : analysis ] .",
    "the 10c source population is compared to samples selected at 1.4  ghz in section [ section:1.4-selected ] and to the @xcite simulated model of the radio sky in section [ section : s3 ] .",
    "optical identifications , redshift estimates and detailed discussions of the source types will be presented in a separate paper .    throughout this paper",
    "the term ` flat spectrum ' refers to an object with spectral index @xmath18 and ` steep spectrum ' to an object with @xmath19 .",
    "the 10c radio survey at 15.7 ghz was made with the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ; @xcite ) with a beam size of 30 arcsec .",
    "it covers @xmath127 deg@xmath17 complete to 1  mjy and @xmath112 deg@xmath17 complete to 0.5 mjy across ten different fields ; a full description of the 10c survey and the source catalogue can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "two of the fields are in the lockman hole , covering an area of 4.64 deg@xmath17 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : source_map ] ) and detecting a total of 299 sources .    to investigate the properties of these 10c sources we have matched the 10c catalogue to other lower - frequency , but usually higher - resolution , radio catalogues as detailed below .",
    "this not only enables us to determine the radio spectral properties of the sources but also allows us to investigate the extent and structure of the radio sources in more detail . the greater positional accuracy of these higher - resolution catalogues is also vital for finding the counterparts of the 10c sources at optical and infrared wavelengths ; the analysis of the optical and infrared properties of the 10c sources will be presented in a later paper .",
    "the other radio surveys of the lockman hole used in this work are listed in table [ tab : surveys ] and briefly described below .",
    "a series of deep observations at 610 mhz made with the gmrt covers the whole 10c lockman hole area except for a small corner of the field containing five 10c sources ( fig .",
    "[ fig : source_map ] ) .",
    "the gmrt image has an rms noise of @xmath160 @xmath16jy per beam in the central area ( see @xcite , for details of the data reduction and source extraction ) . this deep image and",
    "the catalogue derived from it are used here .    a deep survey at 1.4  ghz carried out with the wsrt overlaps a large portion of the 10c survey ( fig .",
    "[ fig : source_map ] ) in the lockman hole @xcite .",
    "the rms noise in the centre of the map is @xmath111 @xmath16jy ; this map and the associated source catalogue are used in this study .",
    "we also make use of several other catalogues and surveys covering the lockman hole region .",
    "the faint images of the radio sky at twenty cm ( first ; @xcite ) , nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) and westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ; @xcite ) cover the whole area .",
    "there are also several deep observations made with the vla within the lockman hole area : @xcite at 324 mhz ( omk2009 ) and @xcite and @xcite at 1.4 ghz ( bi2006 and om2008 ) .",
    "the locations of these surveys are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : source_map ] and are summarised in table [ tab : surveys ] .",
    "sixteen 10c sources in the lockman hole are labelled in the 10c catalogue as part of a ` group ' ( see @xcite for details )  in this case consisting of eight pairs .",
    "contour maps of these eight pairs were examined by eye , along with images of their counterparts in first and/or gmrt . for three of these pairs , there is evidence of structure connecting the two components , so it was decided to combine the two components into one source ( an example of one such source is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10c - extended]).the positions listed in the catalogue for these three pairs is the point mid - way between the two components . for the remaining five pairs",
    "the components were left as separate sources .",
    "this leaves a total of 296 sources in the 10c sample .",
    "these 296 sources , selected at 15.7 ghz , are the subject of this paper .",
    "a subsample of 89 sources , with flux densities greater than 0.5  mjy , selected from the region complete to 0.5  mjy is defined as ` sample a ' .",
    "a second subsample of 118 sources , ` sample b ' , which has some overlap with sample a , forms a sample complete to 1  mjy .",
    "sixty - two 10c sources , 43 of which form a sample complete to 0.5  mjy at 15.7  ghz , are in the deep areas observed with the vla at 1.4  ghz by @xcite and @xcite ( bi2006 and om2008 ) .",
    "all 62 sources are detected at 1.4  ghz so spectral information is available for all of them .",
    "they therefore form a particularly useful subsample , defined as sample c. table [ tab : samples ] contains a summary of the different subsamples used in this paper .",
    "the topcat software package was used to match the catalogues .",
    "the match radius was chosen so as to maximise the number of real associations and avoid false matches .",
    "the error in the 10c positions is @xmath1  6  arcsec , which is larger than the errors in the other catalogues used here ( for example the error in the gmrt positions is @xmath20  1  arcsec ) , so the errors in the 10c positions tend to dominate . here",
    "we describe the process by which we chose a suitable match radius and assessed the probability of genuine and random matches for the 10c and gmrt catalogues . to create a random distribution of sources the 10c sources",
    "were shifted by 5 arcmin in declination . both this shifted catalogue and the true 10c catalogue were then matched to the gmrt catalogue and the angular separation between a shifted or true 10c source and its nearest gmrt source was recorded . once a shifted or true 10c source was matched to a source in the gmrt catalogue no further matches were sought for that source .",
    "the matches were then binned according to their separation for both the true and shifted sources . the resulting distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radiomatches ] .",
    "it can be seen that beyond 15 arcsec the numbers of random matches become comparable for both the true and shifted catalogues ; thus 15 arcsec was chosen as the match radius .",
    "the number of matches with the shifted distribution within a separation of 15 arcsec is 4 ( out of 296 sources ) , meaning the probability of a random match within 15 arcsec is @xmath11.5 percent of the total number of sources being matched .",
    "15 arcsec corresponds to 2.5@xmath21 , where @xmath21 is the typical error in the 10c source positions , suggesting that the matching is limited by the error in the 10c source positions .",
    "this process was repeated for the other catalogues and it was decided that 15 arcsec was a suitable match radius to use when matching each of the catalogues to the 10c catalogue . the number of random matches within 15 arcsec for each catalogue is shown in table [ tab : matching ] .",

    "in addition , for some of the sources in the gmrt catalogue there may be extended low brightness structure too faint to be seen in the high resolution images . in order to reduce these problems , contour plots of all the gmrt sources which matched to a source in the 10c catalogue ( using a 15 arcsec match radius as described in section [ section : match - radius ] ) were examined by eye . for the 50 sources which appeared multiple or extended",
    ", the gmrt images were convolved in aips to a 30-arcsec gaussian to create an image of comparable resolution to the 10c data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : resolution ] ) .",
    "the total 610-mhz flux density of each source ( which had already been matched to a 10c source from the higher resolution image ) was then estimated from the smoothed gmrt image .",

    "the integrated flux density was found by hand using the aips task tvstat .",
    "for the 84 10c sources for which a counterpart was not present in the full resolution gmrt catalogue the gmrt images were used to place an upper limit on the source flux density at 610  mhz . a sub image of 2.5  arcmin was extracted and smoothed ( as described above ) to check for any large scale structure which might have been resolved out in the original image . in eight cases a source",
    "could be seen in the smoothed gmrt images with a peak within 15 arcsec of the 10c source position ; for these sources a value for the integrated flux density was obtained manually using tvstat . for the remaining sources ,",
    "the upper limit on the flux density was taken to be three times the noise in this smoothed image .",
    "it was not possible to get any information about the flux density at 610 mhz for the five 10c sources outside the gmrt area so these sources are excluded from all discussions relating to 610-mhz data .",
    "nvss has a resolution comparable to the 10c survey so the flux densities can be directly compared without any problems caused by resolution differences .",
    "because of this , it is useful to be able to calcuate spectral indices using nvss and 10c values only , so upper limits were found for all sources not matched in the nvss catalogue despite the fact that some of these sources have a counterpart in one of the deeper 1.4-ghz surveys used .",
    "nvss images of all 10c sources without a match in the nvss catalogue were examined to see if there was a source present which was below the catalogue limit and for the few sources where this was the case , the flux density of the nvss source was found manually using the aips task tvstat . for the remaining unmatched sources , an upper limit of three times the local noise in the nvss image",
    "was placed on the flux density .",
    "as the wsrt synthesised beam ( 12 arcsec ) is smaller than the 10c synthesised beam ( 30 arcsec ) , several sources were resolved into multiple components in the wsrt catalogue but appeared as a single component in the 10c catalogue . in order to reduce the effects of resolution when comparing the flux densities ,",
    "sub - images of the wsrt image at the position of each 10c source were examined by eye ; for those sources where there were multiple wsrt components associated with one 10c source , the flux densities of the wsrt components were added together .",
    "( in fact , in all cases except one , the wsrt sources in question were listed as a multi - component source in the wsrt catalogue and the total flux density from the catalogue was used ) .",
    "this process was also carried out for first sources .",
    "for those 10c sources in the wsrt survey area without a match to the wsrt catalogue , the wsrt image was examined to see if there was a source present which was below the catalogue limit .",
    "this was not the case for any of the unmatched 10c sources in the wsrt area .",
    "the upper limit of flux density was taken to be three times the local noise in the wsrt image .",
    "for the 28 sources which were unmatched at 1.4 ghz and outside the wsrt area , an upper limit of 1  mjy was placed on the flux density because this is the first completeness limit and these sources are all within the first survey area but not detected .",
    "the two deep 1.4  ghz surveys made with the vla ( om2008 and bi2006 ) have very small synthesised beams ( @xmath22 arcsec ) compared to the 10c survey .",
    "as images are not available for these surveys , the flux density values from the catalogues were used .",
    "om2008 do account for the fact that some of the sources may be extended when calculating flux densities .",
    "they convolve the full resolution images to an effective beam size of 3 , 6 and 12 arcsec and compare the flux densities derived from the four images .",
    "bi2006 do not attempt to account for extended sources when calculating the flux densities , however there is only one 10c sources which has a counterpart in bi2006 and not in any other 1.4-ghz catalogue so this will not significantly affect these results .",

    "there have been some systematic studies at higher flux densities .",
    "@xcite studied the 15-ghz variability of 51 9c sources with flux densities @xmath23 mjy over a 3-year period .",
    "they found that while there was no evidence for variability ( above the @xmath246 percent flux calibration uncertainties ) in steep spectrum sources , half of the flat spectrum objects were variable . in total , 29 percent of the sources studied were found to vary .",
    "@xcite observed 173 20-ghz sources with flux densities @xmath25 mjy over a 2-year period and found that 42 percent varied by more than 10 percent .",
    "however , they found no correlation between variability and radio spectral index .",
    "more recently , @xcite investigated the variability of 159 sources with 20-ghz flux densities @xmath26 mjy and found the variability to be slightly larger than that found by @xcite , with an r.m.s .",
    "amplitude of 38 percent at 20  ghz on a timescale of a few years .",
    "@xcite note that there is some indication that the variability decreases as flux density decreases .",
    "@xcite studied the variability of a brighter sample ( @xmath27  mjy ) at 20  ghz and found similar levels of variability to @xcite at higher flux densities still @xcite have looked at variability at 16  ghz in a complete sample of 97 sources with flux densities",
    "@xmath28  jy over timescales of about 1.5  years . they found that 15 percent of the sources vary by more than 20 percent ; however , in contrast to the results of @xcite but in agreement with those of @xcite , the spectra of the variable sources are flatter than those of the non - variable ones .",
    "the variability properties of the population studied here are not known .",
    "however , on the assumption that the faint sources in the 10c sample exhibit the same sort of flux densiy variations as shown in the higher flux density samples discussed above , a significant fraction of them are likely to have varied over the period between the observations .",
    "thus the spectral indices of individual objects may be unreliable .",
    "however , given that the sources are probably equally likely to increase or decrease in flux density this should not have a major effect on the overall spectral index distribution .      to investigate the spectral properties of the source sample in a quantitative way , the spectral index was calculated between 15.7  ghz and 1.4  ghz ( @xmath29 ) and 15.7  ghz and 610  mhz ( @xmath30 ) for each source . for @xmath29",
    "all 296 sources are studied , for @xmath30 the 5 sources outside the gmrt area are excluded as there is no 610-mhz flux density information available . for the sources with no match in gmrt ,",
    "a limiting spectral index was calculated from the upper limit placed on the flux density from the gmrt image , as described in section [ section : res_gmrt ] .",
    "the distributions of @xmath29 were investigated in two ways , using slightly different procedures , to check the effects of resolution on the data .",
    "the first , @xmath31 , makes use of all of the 1.4-ghz data available ; for the sources where there is more than one 1.4-ghz flux density , flux densities are chosen according to resolution in the following order of preference : nvss , wsrt , om2008 , first , bi2006 ; first and bi2006 are last as they are the most likely to resolve out some of the flux of the 10c sources because of their small beam sizes ( 5 and 1.5  arcsec respectively ) .",
    "om2008 also has a small beam ( 1.6 arcsec ) but the sources have been convolved with gaussians of varying radius to try and overcome the resolution problem .",
    "nvss and wsrt have larger beam sizes ( 30 and 12 arcsec respectively ) which are more comparable to the 10c beam . for the sources with no match in any of the 1.4-ghz catalogues which are in the wsrt survey area , the upper limit from the wsrt image ( as described in section [ section : wsrt - first ] ) , is used to calculate a limiting spectral index . for the remaining sources , an upper limit of 1 mjy from the first survey is used .",
    "the second value , @xmath32 , only uses values from the nvss catalogue as this has a resolution comparable to the 10c survey . for the 10c sources which do not appear in nvss ,",
    "the limit is derived from the nvss image ( see section [ section : nvss ] ) .",
    "these values of the spectral index contain a larger number of upper limits but provide a useful comparison when considering the effects of resolution .",

    "this is usually taken as the ratio of the integrated or total flux density of a source @xmath36 and its peak flux density on a map @xmath37 i.e. @xmath38 . for the 10c sample considered here we do not use the 10c observations to find @xmath34 because the large beam size of @xmath39 arcsec means that the majority of the sources are unresolved .",
    "instead , we use the matched data from the lower frequency catalogues , which have smaller beam sizes and can therefore provide more information about the angular size of a source .",
    "four values of @xmath34 are calculated , using data from the gmrt , first and omk2009 ( 324  mhz vla observations ) catalogues , which all have beam sizes @xmath40 arcsec , and the wsrt catalogue which has a beam size of 12 arcsec .",
    "the deep 1.4  ghz vla observations ( om2008 and bi2006 ) are not used in this analysis because their beam sizes are considerably smaller ( @xmath41 arcsec ) so that the data are not comparable with those from the other catalogues used here .    to take account of the effects of noise , several other studies ( e.g , ) plot @xmath34 against the signal to noise ratio and fit a lower envelope to the data ; reflecting this about @xmath42 gives a curve which provides the cutoff between the extended and compact sources .",
    "we have not used this method for the sample of sources in this paper due both to the relatively small number of sources in the sample and to the range of different surveys used . instead , each source was examined by eye and the criteria described below were decided upon to identify the extended sources .",

    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_gmrt ] for the gmrt data , where the number of sources with values of @xmath43 , which must be due to errors in the flux density values , increases at lower signal to noise ratios .",
    "therefore different criteria are used to identify the extended sources at high and low signal to noise .",
    "sources were classified as extended if they had a signal to noise ratio greater than 20 in the gmrt data and values of @xmath44 in at least two of the datasets used , or a value of @xmath45 in at least one of the datasets .",
    "sources with a signal to noise ratio less than 20 in the gmrt data were classified as extended if the value of @xmath34 was greater than 2 in any of the datasets .",
    "a comparison of two of the @xmath34 values used is shown in fig .",

    "there are also a significant number of sources ( 34 ) for which we have no information about their structure .",
    "recent work by @xcite using the at20 g survey found that for @xmath55 there was a clear divide between the extended , steep spectrum sources and the compact , flat spectrum sources .",
    "however , when looking at the higher frequency spectral index , @xmath56 , they found that the extended sources displayed a much broader range in spectral index .",
    "this is consistent with the flat spectrum tail in the spectral index distribution for extended sources observed here and supports the idea that a flat spectrum core is becoming increasingly dominant at higher frequencies .",
    "a study by investigated the properties of a sample of 111 sources using data at 1.4 and 5  ghz and found that nearly all the extended or multiple sources were steep spectrum .",
    "the lack of flat spectrum extended sources in the study is probably due to the lower frequencies used , as at these frequencies the flat spectrum core has not yet become dominant .",

    "the function fitted to the source count is a broken power law , as shown in equation [ eqn : sourcecount ] ,    @xmath57    it is significant that the break in this power law occurs at 2.8  mjy i.e. at approximately the same flux density as the change in the spectral index distribution observed here .    to examine this",

    "for example , @xcite used a sample of combined nvss - first galaxies ( config ) to construct a 1.4-ghz source count for fri and frii sources .",
    "they found that the frii population is dropping out as flux density decreases below approximately 20  mjy at 1.4  ghz , leaving a source population dominated by fri sources at lower flux densities .",
    "this change in the population at @xmath60  mjy corresponds to @xmath61  mjy at 15  ghz for a steep spectrum source ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the simulated source counts produced by @xcite ( which are discussed in more detail in section [ section : s3 ] ) also show that the frii population drops out at a few mjy at 18  ghz .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the changes in the spectral index distributions at around 1  mjy in our 15  ghz sample are due in part to the disappearance of the frii sources .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ section : s3 ] , the dominance of a flat spectrum population at flux densities below 1  mjy is in clear disagreement with the models of @xcite , and .",
    "the source population at 1.4  ghz has been much more widely studied than the higher frequency population and models of the faint population at higher frequencies are often extrapolated from this lower frequency data .",
    "it is therefore useful to see how the spectral index distribution of the 10c source population compares to that for sources selected at 1.4  ghz .",
    "two samples of sources at 1.4  ghz were used ; the first sample was selected from the first catalogue ( sample p ) and the second from the nvss catalogue ( sample q ) .",
    "the first catalogue is deeper so sample p provides more information about the faint source population ; the nvss survey on the other hand has a beam size comparable to the 10c survey so provides more reliable spectral indices .",
    "some consideration needs to be given to the limiting flux densities of the first and nvss catalogues and the 10c catalogue which they are being matched .",
    "a source with a 1.4-ghz flux density of 3.4  mjy ( the completeness limit of nvss ) should be detected in 10c unless it has a spectral index greater than 0.8 .",
    "it is therefore expected that counterparts will be found at 15.7  ghz for the majority of the nvss sources .",
    "first , however , has a completeness limit of 1  mjy ; a source with a 1.4-ghz flux density of 1  mjy could be detected at 15.7  ghz if it had @xmath63 .",
    "we therefore expect a larger proportion of lower limits on the spectral indices for first sources .",
    "all first sources in the 10c deep fields ( the areas containing sample a ) were selected ( see fig . [",
    "fig : source_map ] ) giving a sample of 127 sources selected at 1.4  ghz .",
    "these sources were matched to the full 10c catalogue using a match radius of 15 arcsec , as described in section [ section : matching ] .",
    "the difference in resolution between the two catalogues meant that there were several sources which were resolved into multiple components in first but unresolved in 10c . for those cases where several first sources matched to one 10c source ,",

    "as expected the distributions are noticeably different ; the sources selected at 1.4  ghz show one peak at @xmath65 , while the sample selected at 15.7  ghz displays an additional peak at @xmath66 .",
    "the additional population of flat spectrum sources , as expected , are poorly represented by selecting at 1.4  ghz .",
    "this is the challenge that extrapolating from lower frequencies to predict the high frequency radio population presents .",
    "it relies on accurate modelling of the source population and of how the spectral behaviour of sources varies with frequency ; it is particularly unreliable when there are no observations at nearby frequencies at the required flux density .",
