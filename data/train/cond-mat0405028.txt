    "the possible existence of the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) superfluid phases @xcite has been pointed out in the early sixties and it has given rise to much work ever since that time .",
    "in addition to their intrinsic fundamental interest @xcite , these phases are quite relevant experimentally since they are expected to arise in superconductors with very high critical fields , which are naturally very actively searched for . on several occasions these phases have been claimed to be observed experimentally , but to date these hopes have not been firmly substantiated .",
    "very recently anomalies in the heavy fermion compound cecoin@xmath1 have been attributed to fflo phases @xcite .",
    "the case of two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems is of particular interest @xcite since they are experimentally quite relevant .",
    "indeed a major strategy to observe these transitions is to eliminate orbital currents , which are responsible for the low critical fields in standard superconductors .",
    "this can be achieved in quasi two- dimensional systems , made of widely separated conducting planes , such as organic compounds or high @xmath2 cuprate superconductors . in this case",
    "hopping between planes is very severely restricted .",
    "hence the orbital currents perpendicular to the planes are very weak when a strong magnetic field is applied parallel to the planes , and there is essentially no orbital pair breaking effect which opens the path to fflo phases at much higher fields . indeed experimental results in organic compounds have been claimed quite recently @xcite to be compatible with the existence of fflo phases .",
    "naturally when the magnetic field is not exactly parallel to the planes , one finds in addition vortex - like structures and the physical situation gets even more complex @xcite .",
    "the fflo transition in 2d systems is believed to be second order and in particular burkhardt and rainer @xcite have studied in details the transition to a planar phase , where the order parameter @xmath3 is a simple @xmath4 at the transition .",
    "this phase has been found by larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite to be the best one in 3d at @xmath5 for a second order phase transition . and",
    "in 3d it is also found to be the preferred one in the vicinity of the tricritical point and below @xcite , although in this case the transition turns out to be first order ( except at very low temperature ) .",
    "however it is not clear that this is always the case since , as first explored by larkin and ovchinnikov , this order parameter is in competition with any superposition of plane waves , provided that their wavevectors have all the same modulus .",
    "indeed we have shown very recently @xcite that , at low temperature , the transition is rather a first order one , toward an order parameter with a more complex structure .",
    "for example at @xmath5 it is very near the linear combination of three cosines oscillating in orthogonal directions .",
    "in this paper we explore the low temperature range in 2d and show that the second order transition is indeed toward rather more complex order parameters . a short report of our results",
    "has already been published @xcite . a first step in this direction",
    "is found in the recent work of shimahara @xcite who found a transition toward a superposition of three cosines .",
    "here we show that , when the temperature is lowered toward @xmath5 , one obtains a cascade of transitions toward order parameters with an ever increasing number of plane waves .",
    "the @xmath5 limit is singular in this respect .",
    "this is actually clear from the beginning",
    ". indeed if one looks at the second order term in the expansion of the free energy in powers of the order parameter , which gives the location of the fflo transition , one finds it to be a singular function of the plane wave wavevector .",
    "this is recalled in the next section .",
    "then we calculate the fourth order term in the free energy expansion and show that the phases which are selected by this term display the cascade of transitions mentionned above .",
    "the general expression for the free energy difference @xmath6 between the superconducting and the normal state can be obtained in a number of ways , starting for example @xcite from eilenberger s expression in terms of the quasiclassical green s function or from the gap equation @xcite and gorkov s equations . when the result is expanded up to fourth order term in powers of the fourier components @xmath7 of the order parameter @xmath8 : @xmath9 one obtains : @xmath10 where we have momentum conservation @xmath11 in the fourth order term and @xmath12 is the single spin density of states at the fermi surface .",
    "the explicit expression of @xmath13 in terms of the standard bcs interaction @xmath14 and of the free fermions propagator is : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 and @xmath18 , with @xmath19 being half the chemical potential difference between the two fermionic populations forming pairs , @xmath20 the kinetic energy measured from the fermi surface for @xmath21 and @xmath22 the matsubara frequency . performing the @xmath23 integration and the 2d angular average over @xmath24 gives : @xmath25 where we have introduced the dimensionless wavevector @xmath26 . in eq.(4 )",
    "the summation has to be cut - off at a frequency @xmath27 in the standard bcs way .",
    "it is more convenient to rewrite @xmath28 , by introducing physical quantities related to the @xmath29 case , as : @xmath30 with : @xmath31 we have introduced : @xmath32 which is zero on the spinodal transition line ( the line in the @xmath33 plane where the normal state becomes absolutely unstable against a transition toward a space independent order parameter ) and is positive above it . at the fflo transition we are looking at , we have @xmath34 .",
    "the actual transition corresponds to the largest possible @xmath35 at fixed @xmath36 . from eq.(7 ) this corresponds to have the largest @xmath37 . hence from eq.(5 ) we want to minimize @xmath38 with respect to @xmath39 . at low temperature",
    "it is more convenient to express @xmath40 as : @xmath41 \\label{eq8}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the integration contour runs actually infinitesimally above the real @xmath42 axis .    at @xmath5 the integration",
    "is easily performed to give : @xmath43 the minimum is reached for @xmath44 , in agreement with shimahara @xcite and burkhardt and rainer @xcite , and @xmath45 at this minimum . in this case , from eq.(7 ) , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the zero temperature bcs phase gap ( this corresponds to the value @xmath48 for the spinodal transition ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath49 for the location of the fflo transition , again in agreement with previous work .",
    "it is worth to note that , as already mentionned in the introduction , the location @xmath50 of the minimum corresponds to a singular point for @xmath51 since we have explicitely @xmath52 for @xmath53 . while @xmath51 itself is continuous , its derivative is discontinuous for @xmath50 .    for @xmath54",
    "there is no singular behaviour and we find the value of @xmath55 giving the minimum @xmath40 by writing that its derivative with respect to @xmath56 is zero . integrating the result by parts leads to the condition : @xmath57 where we have taken the new variable @xmath58 and defined the reduced temperature @xmath59 . only the ranges @xmath60 and @xmath61 contribute to the real part of the integral .",
    "since at low @xmath36 we have @xmath62 , this last range will only give an exponentially small contribution because of the factor @xmath63 .",
    "since this same factor makes @xmath64 to be at most of order 3 , we can make at low @xmath36 to leading order @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "it is then seen that we must have @xmath67 , because @xmath68 makes the left hand side of eq.(10 ) much larger than unity at low @xmath36 .",
    "this implies @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the integral is then easily evaluated and eq.(10 ) gives finally to leading order : @xmath71 note that this result is in disagreemeent with the analysis given @xcite by l. n. bulaevskii .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is discussed in details in appendix a. in particular we rederive in this appendix our eq .",
    "( [ leading ] ) from the starting equation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a more complete low temperature expansion can be fairly easily extracted from eq.([leading ] ) .",
    "as previously seen , the range @xmath72 in the integration is sufficient since the other integration range gives an exponentially small term . with the change of variable @xmath73 , eq.([leading ] ) leads to : @xmath74 where we have defined @xmath75 . neglecting terms of order @xmath76 eq .",
    "( [ leading3 ] ) can be written as : @xmath77 from eq.([leading2 ] ) the leading order for @xmath78 is @xmath79 . in the second integral in eq.([devel",
    "] ) we can replace @xmath78 by @xmath80 since @xmath81 .",
    "setting @xmath82 , we obtain an expansion of @xmath83 in powers of @xmath84 by expanding the first integral up to second order in powers of @xmath85 : @xmath86 valid up to the order @xmath87 . solving this equation order by order , we find the following expansion for @xmath78 : @xmath88 this expression leads to a marked improvement when it is compared to the straight numerical evaluation of the matsubara sums in eq.(6 ) .",
    "this is seen in fig.[fig0 ] where we have plotted the optimal @xmath89 from straight numerical calculation , as well as its leading low temperature approximation and the one resulting from the expansion eq.([alowtemp ] ) .",
    "we give also for convenience , in the lower panel , the dependence of our reduced temperature @xmath90 as a function of the ratio @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the standard bcs critical temperature , found for @xmath93 . in the low temperature limit @xmath94 , we have merely @xmath95 and @xmath49 , hence @xmath96 and the dotted straight line in the lower panel gives this limiting behaviour @xmath97 .",
    "the second order term in the free energy gives the same transition line for all the combinations of plane waves .",
    "the selection among the various possible order parameters will be made by the fourth order term in the free energy expansion , as pointed out by larkin and ovchinnikov .",
    "the selected state will correspond to the lowest fourth order term .",
    "so we turn now to this fourth order term .",
    "its general expression is given by eq.(2 ) with @xcite : @xmath98 where we have used already momentum conservation @xmath99 .",
    "since all the wavevectors @xmath100 have the same modulus given by eq.(11 ) , this momentum conservation implies in our 2d situation either @xcite @xmath101 together with @xmath102 , or equivalently @xmath103 together with @xmath104 .",
    "moreover one has the additional possibility @xmath105 together with @xmath106 .",
    "the two first possibilities lead to a same coefficient called @xmath107 by lo where @xmath108 is the angle between @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "similarly the last possibility leads to a coefficient @xmath111 .",
    "explicitely the fourth order term in the free energy ( last term of the r.h.s . of eq.(2 ) ) becomes @xcite : @xmath112 with , after a change of variable in the summation : @xmath113 and @xmath114 when the @xmath115 integration is performed , taking into account @xmath116 since @xmath117 , one finds : @xmath118 where the bracket means the angular average , and similarly : @xmath119.[(2i\\bar{\\omega   } _ { n})^{2}-({\\bf    k}.{\\bf   q } _ { 2}/m ) ^{2 } ] } > \\label{eq17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on which it is clear that @xmath120 .",
    "let us first consider @xmath121 . as in the preceding section when going from eq.(6 ) to eq.(8 ) , it is more convenient to transform the sum over matsubara frequencies into an integral on the real frequency axis .",
    "when one furthermore performs a by parts integration over the frequency @xmath42 , one gets from eq.([eq16 ] ) : @xmath122.[\\bar{q } \\cos ( \\theta +   \\alpha /2)-(1 + \\omega / \\bar { \\mu } ) ] } \\label{eq18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where as above @xmath123 and the integration contour runs again infinitesimally above the real @xmath42 axis . here in the angular integration",
    "we have taken the reference axis bisecting the angle between @xmath109 and @xmath124 .",
    "this angular integration is performed by residues , taking @xmath125 as a variable . for @xmath126",

    "when this result is inserted in eq.([eq18 ] ) and @xmath129 is taken as new variable , one finds , introducing again the reduced temperature @xmath59 : @xmath130 with @xmath131 .    up to now",
    "we have made no approximation in our calculation and the result is valid at any temperature .",
    "let us now focus on the low temperature regime @xmath132 . because of the factor @xmath133 , only the vicinity of @xmath134 will contribute .",
    "moreover only the half circle contour around the pole @xmath135 and the range @xmath136 contribute to the real part . in this last domain",
    "we have @xmath137 from our result for @xmath138 eq.(11 ) , so we can again simplify the hyperbolic cosine into an exponential ( although this is not in practice a good approximation numerically ) . with the further change of variable @xmath139 in the resulting integral , we find to leading order : @xmath140 } - \\frac{8}{\\sqrt {   \\pi}(1 + \\cos ( \\alpha /2 ) ) }   \\int_{0 } ^ { \\infty } \\ ! dv   \\ : \\frac{\\exp(-v ^{2 } ) } { v ^{2}+\\beta ^{2 } }   \\label{jalpha}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have substituted explicitely the result eq.(11 ) for @xmath138 and have set @xmath141 .",
    "the integral in this result can not be further simplified in general and is related to parabolic cylinder functions .",
    "let us consider now some important limiting cases for this result .",
    "first we take at fixed @xmath142 the limit @xmath143 .",
    "this implies @xmath144 , the first term goes to zero and the integral is easily calculated in this limit , leading to : @xmath145 on the other hand if at fixed @xmath146 we take the limit @xmath147 , we have @xmath148 . the limiting behaviour of the integral is @xmath149 as can be obtained through a by parts integration , the dominant divergent contribution from the two terms cancels out and we are left with @xcite : @xmath150 which goes naturally to infinity for @xmath151 .",
    "these two limits can be obtained more rapidly by making the proper simplifications from the start of the calculation eq.([eq18 ] ) .",
    "the two limiting cases which we have just considered show that , at low temperature , @xmath121 has a quite remarkable behaviour . for most of the range",
    "it is negative as it can be seen from eq.([jlargealpha ] ) and it even goes to large negative values when @xmath142 gets very small .",
    "this tends to favor states with small angle between wavevectors , as we will see below . on the other hand for @xmath152 or very small @xmath153 is positive and very large , as it results from eq.([eq23 ] ) .",
    "clearly at low @xmath36 the interesting range is the small @xmath142 domain where we can write @xmath154 .",
    "surprisingly @xmath153 first starts to increase strongly from its @xmath155 value before going down to very negative values .",
    "this can be seen simply by looking at the specific point @xmath156 for which the second term is negligible and which gives to dominant order @xmath157 , even more diverging for @xmath151 than the @xmath158 value .",
    "the integral of @xmath121 over @xmath142 can also be analytically evaluated , and it shows that the strong positive peak at small @xmath142 dominates over the negative contribution from the rest of the range .",
    "this quasi - singular behaviour of @xmath121 is summarized in fig.[fig1 ] where we have plotted @xmath121 for various temperatures .",
    "we perform now the same kind of treatment for @xmath159 .",
    "one goes again from eq.([eq17 ] ) to an integration on the real frequency axis .",
    "however there is no integration by parts , and the angular average to be calculated is somewhat more complicated .",
    "it can nevertheless be performed by the same method and gives explicitely , with the same variable @xmath126 as above : @xmath160.[\\cos ( \\theta + \\alpha /2 ) ^{2}-y^{2 } ] } =   \\frac{1}{2y   \\sqrt { y ^{2}- 1 } } ( \\frac{1}{y ^{2}- \\cos^{2 } ( \\alpha   /2)}+",
    "\\frac{1}{y ^{2}- \\sin^{2 } ( \\alpha /2 ) } )   \\label{eq24}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second term is obtained from the first one by the change @xmath161 .",
    "this leads to @xmath162 with : @xmath163 here we have contributions coming from half circles around the poles at @xmath164 and contributions from the two domains @xmath165 and @xmath166 . neglecting terms which are exponentially small in the low temperature limit , we can replace the hyperbolic tangent by @xmath167 in the @xmath168 domain and for the @xmath169 pole . gathering similar contributions",
    "this gives : @xmath170 where we have used the fact that , without the @xmath171 term , the integral can be performed exactly to give @xmath172 .",
    "we have taken advantage of this to have the factor @xmath173 which is going rapidly to zero for large @xmath129 .",
    "this will be of use when we consider below temperature corrections .",
    "the last term in eq.([eq26 ] ) disappears in the combination @xmath174 , so we omit it from now on .    looking now for the dominant contribution at low temperature , we simplify the hyperbolic tangent in the range @xmath165 since its argument @xmath175 is large and positive .",
    "so one finds expressions which are similar to the one encountered in the calculation of @xmath153 .",
    "moreover , because of the relation @xmath176 , we can restrict ourselves to the case @xmath177 . in this case",
    "the expression obtained by the replacement @xmath161 is very simple since the corresponding value of @xmath141 is always very large at low t. this leads finally to : @xmath178 where we have taken into account that the second term is only significant when @xmath142 is small , so we have made @xmath155 in its prefactor .    in the limit @xmath151 with fixed @xmath142 , we have @xmath179 and one gets merely : @xmath180 again if we take @xmath181 at fixed @xmath146 , @xmath182 , the dominant divergent contribution cancels and we find : @xmath183 these two limits can be obtained again more directly . from these cases",
    "we can guess that @xmath184 is always negative .",
    "this is seen on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where @xmath185 has been plotted .",
    "however , in the same way as @xmath186 , it has also a singular behaviour at small @xmath142 .",
    "while for @xmath187 it diverges as @xmath188 , it goes to the finite value @xmath189 for @xmath152 .",

    ", we do not expect them to be so good quantitatively at intermediate temperature .",
    "it is actually possible to improve these analytical results markedly in this respect at the price of a slight complication by including the first two terms in an expansion in powers of @xmath195 .",
    "this is the similar to what we have done at the end of section ii for the second order term , and we follow here the same procedure , together with the steps we have just taken above for the calculation of @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "we first consider first @xmath193 and start from the exact eq.([eq20 ] ) .",
    "since the contribution from the domain @xmath166 is again exponentially small in the low temperature regime , we keep only the half circle contour around @xmath196 and the @xmath197 domain .",
    "the integral appearing in eq.([eq20 ] ) can be split in two terms by : @xmath198 therefore @xmath193 can be written as @xmath199 and we concentrate on the calculation of @xmath200 . with the same notations @xmath201 , @xmath75 and the change of variable @xmath202 , eq.([eq20 ] )",
    "leads to : @xmath203 where we have set @xmath204 . the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "of eq.([jo ] ) is expanded for low @xmath205 by @xmath206 and the resulting temperature correction is calculated to lowest order , replacing @xmath78 by @xmath207 .",
    "this gives our following final expression , which has to be used together with eq.(16 ) for @xmath78 and @xmath138 : @xmath208 the second term in the r.h.s of this equation is only relevant for angles that are close to zero .",
    "otherwise , it gives an exponentially small contribution in the low temperature limit . in the expression obtained by the change",
    "@xmath209 , this term is exponentially small in any case and can be forgotten .",
    "the first and the third term can be calculated more explicitly for angles @xmath142 which are not close to zero ( this is in particular the case for @xmath210 ) , which implies @xmath211 . for the first term in particular we can make use of our results in section ii for the temperature expansion where similar terms were found .",
    "this leads finally in this regime to : @xmath212 for various temperatures , we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] these low temperature expressions with the exact calculation of @xmath193 , from the direct numerical summation in eq.([eq16 ] ) over matsubara frequencies ( with @xmath138 obtained by the numerical minimisation of @xmath38 given by eq.([eq6 ] ) ) .",
    "we see that , at this level of accuracy , they agree remarkably well up to rather high temperatures .    ]",
    "figure-t0.01bis.eps ] figure-t0.05bis.eps    we turn now to a similar calculation for @xmath194 and take up from eq.([eq26 ] ) .",
    "we have already pointed out that , since we can restrict ourselves to @xmath213 , the replacement @xmath214 gives a value of @xmath215 which is always large at low temperature .",
    "therefore , in this replacement , the integral in eq.([eq26 ] ) can be calculated to lowest order in @xmath216 and gives @xmath217 . in the same way in the first term",
    "the hyperbolic tangent can be replaced by -1 in this substitution . with the same change of variable as for @xmath193",
    ", we have finally : @xmath218 as for the calculation of @xmath193 , we can have a more explicit result by expanding the denominator in the integral to first order in powers of @xmath216 and computing the resulting temperature correction to lowest order by replacing @xmath78 by @xmath80 .",
    "but we will not write the cumbersome resulting formula .    nevertheless , as done previously for @xmath193 , we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] our low temperature expressions with the exact calculation of @xmath219 , @xmath138 and @xmath220 .",
    "the discrepancy appears only above @xmath221 in the vinicity of @xmath222 and is mainly due to the fact that it becomes inaccurate to consider that @xmath223 is large in calculating @xmath224 , as we have done ( see above eq.([eq27 ] ) ) .",
    "however our low temperature expressions are already sufficient to describe the cascade .",
    "the second order term in the expansion of the free energy @xmath225 gives the location of the transition @xmath226 and the optimum wavevectors modulus @xmath227 entering the order parameter @xmath228 but it can not distinguish between different order parameter structures , because from eq.([freeener ] ) the fourier components @xmath229 of the order parameter @xmath230 are decoupled in the second order term .",
    "the resulting degeneracy is lifted by the fourth order term when one goes slightly into the superfluid phase .",
    "this is the basis of the analysis of larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite and of shimahara @xcite .",
    "so to speak , the wavevectors directions are independent at the level of the second order term while the fourth order one provides an effective interaction between these directions .",
    "since the expression eq.([fourthorder ] ) for the fourth order term depends only on the angle @xmath231 between the wavevectors @xmath232 and @xmath233 through @xmath234 and @xmath235 , the wavevector interaction appears therefore simply as pair interactions depending only on the relative positions of the 2d wavevectors on the circle .",
    "we note however that @xmath235 corresponds to an interaction between two pairs of opposite wavevectors @xmath236 whereas @xmath234 gives an interaction between two single wavevectors .",
    "we consider now the ingredients which lead to the prediction of a cascade of transitions between order parameters with increasing number of wavevectors when the temperature goes to zero .",
    "first , since @xmath193 takes very large positive values for @xmath237 smaller than a critical angle @xmath238 , we can consider that the angle domain @xmath239 is forbidden in order to avoid a dramatic increase of the free energy @xmath225 . to be quite specific",
    "we define @xmath240 by @xmath241",
    ". however we could as well take the critical angle as @xmath242 which gives the minimum of @xmath193 , since @xmath240 and @xmath242 are anyway very close as it can be seen on fig.[fig1 ] ( we will indeed consider also @xmath243 in the following ) . on the other hand",
    "it is favorable to take @xmath244 slightly above @xmath238 since it is the region where @xmath193 takes its most negative values .",
    "we note that the behavior of @xmath194 is not as strong compared to @xmath193 , so we neglect @xmath194 in a first approximation .",
    "next we see that @xmath245 diverges as @xmath246 at low temperature and it is necessarily present in the free energy eq.([fourthorder ] ) from the terms with @xmath247 .",
    "however their unfavorable effect on @xmath248 is lowered in relative value if one increases the number @xmath249 of wavevectors , since we have @xmath249 terms in eq.([fourthorder ] ) containing @xmath245 compared to a total number of @xmath250 terms .",
    "since we want to minimize @xmath248 , this leads us to increase @xmath249 and hence to decrease the angle between wavevectors as much as possible .",
    "since the angle between wavevectors is bounded from below by @xmath238 , we expect for symmetry reasons that the optimum structure to have regularly spaced wavevectors with an interval angle slightly above @xmath238 .",
    "the last ingredient to predict the cascade is the fact that @xmath238 decreases with temperature . as a result ,",
    "the number @xmath249 of plane waves in the optimum structure increases when the temperature goes to zero .",
    "this leads to a cascade of states where the @xmath5 limit is singular . in the next sections , we present our arguments in more details .",
    "we begin by considering only the contribution @xmath251 to the free energy @xmath225 from the @xmath193 terms .",
    "even so the full problem of finding the order parameter structure minimizing the fourth order term is not a simple one .",
    "however it is natural to assume that the wavevectors of the @xmath249 plane waves have a regular angular separation with an angle @xmath252 between neighbouring wavevectors , so that their angular position is given on the circle by @xmath253 .",
    "otherwise we would have a minimum corresponding to a disordered situation for the angles , which sounds quite unlikely ( note that we can not collapse an angle to zero since we work at fixed @xmath249 ; we will later on minimize with respect to @xmath249 ) .",
    "then it is easy to show that the weight @xmath254 of the various wavevectors are all equal . indeed the fourth order term eq.([fourthorder ] ) is just a quadratic form in @xmath255 and minimizing it is formally identical , for example , to find the lowest energy for a single particle in a tight binding hamiltonian on a ring , with hopping matrix element @xmath256 between site @xmath257 and site @xmath258 ( except for the on - site term which is @xmath259 ) . the eigenvectors are plane waves and the eigenvalues are @xmath260 with @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "since @xmath263 for @xmath264 , the lowest eigenvalue corresponds to @xmath265 which means that the weight @xmath255 are all equal .",
    "conversely if we assume from the start that the all weights @xmath255 are equal , our problem of finding the best @xmath266 s is the same as the one of finding the equilibrium position of atoms on a ring with repulsive short range interaction ( because @xmath121 is large and positive for small @xmath142 ) and attractive long range interaction ( because @xmath121 is negative for larger @xmath142 ) .",
    "we expect the equilibrium to correspond to a crystalline structure with regularly spaced atoms .",
    "this takes into account that @xmath121 is a long range potential ( clearly this regular spacing would not be the equilibrium if we had a strongly short range potential enforcing a specific distance between our atoms ) .",
    "naturally in this argument we take @xmath249 large enough to fill up the ring with atoms .",
    "so we come to the conclusion that the minimum energy corresponds to equally spaced wavevectors .    finally when we minimize the total free energy eq.([freeener ] ) with respect to the weight @xmath255 we find the general result : @xmath267 where we have , in the case @xmath268 : @xmath269 we note that we still have a degeneracy of the lowest energy configuration with respect to the choice of the plane waves phases .",
    "we now take also into account in the free energy the terms containing @xmath235 .",
    "these terms appear when there are pairs of opposite wavevectors @xmath236 . with our assumption of regularly spaced wavevectors ,",
    "this corresponds to even @xmath249 - in which case we have @xmath270 pairs - whereas for odd @xmath249 , there are no @xmath235 terms in the free energy .",
    "note that @xmath194 is negative for any angle @xmath271 so that it is favorable to take pairs of opposite wavevectors .",
    "this seems to be in favor of taking @xmath249 even and we will indeed see that as a result states with even @xmath249 will be selected .    for even @xmath249 ,",
    "the total free energy is : @xmath272 where we have used @xmath273 and @xmath274 ; @xmath275 is a shorthand for @xmath276 and so on .",
    "the fact that @xmath194 is always negative has a direct consequence on the phases of the plane waves . in order to minimize the free energy they have to be chosen so that @xmath277 is always real .",
    "writing @xmath278 , this implies that @xmath279 for any @xmath257 , where @xmath280 is a constant phase which can be chosen to be zero , since this merely corresponds to a global phase change for the order parameter .",
    "this link between phases for opposite wavevectors removes only a part of the degeneracy , since the phase @xmath281 can be still arbitrarily chosen .",
    "now we see that the contribution of the @xmath235 terms to the free energy is a quadratic form in @xmath282 with negative coefficients , and no on - site contribution .",
    "this is quite similar to what we have found for the @xmath193 terms in the preceding subsection .",
    "so the equal weight distribution , which minimizes the @xmath193 terms , gives also independently the minimum of the contribution of the @xmath194 terms .",
    "this means that the inclusion of these last terms in the free energy does not change the optimum structure apart from the phase link between opposite wavevectors",
    ". finally the total minimum free energy is still given by eq.([minnodd ] ) , where eq.([g2odd ] ) is valid for odd @xmath249 , but has to be replaced for even n by : @xmath283 in this last case the corresponding equilibrium order parameter is real , being a sum of cosines of the form @xmath284 .",
    "we turn now to the minimization of the free energy with respect to @xmath249 .",
    "we consider now the numerical calculation of @xmath285 for different order parameter structures , i.e. , for various values of the number of plane waves @xmath249 . from eq.([minnodd ] ) the equilibrium order parameter corresponds to the maximum @xmath286 ^{-1}$ ] . in fig .",

    "they are therefore completely sufficient quantitatively to study the cascade .",
    "[ fig4 ] displays the same quantity for lower temperatures , exhibiting the cascade of transitions .",
    "an interesting feature of this cascade is that an order parameter with an odd number of plane waves is never the lowest energy solution , except from the @xmath287 case , already found by shimahara @xcite . the reasons for this result will appear clearly in the next section , where we will study analytically the asymptotic regime of low temperatures .",
    "in the low temperature limit @xmath288 , we can derive an explicit expansion for the value of the zero @xmath240 of @xmath193 , as well as the location @xmath242 of its minimum .",

    "the zero @xmath240 is naturally in between .",

    "this means that the transition stays always second order ( a negative sign would have implied a first order transition and a breakdown of our fourth order expansion ) .",
    "finally it seems from eq.([g21]-[g22 ] ) that it is favourable to have an even number of plane waves in order to take advantage of the additional @xmath353 contribution .",
    "this can be confirmed by a more careful comparison between two consecutives values of @xmath249 .",

    "we gain naturally the @xmath353 term in eq.([g22 ] ) , but we increase the first term due to the unfavorable of the @xmath245 term . nevertheless : @xmath357 = \\frac{1}{2 n(n-1 ) t } - \\ln(n-1 )   + { \\mathcal o}(1).\\ ] ] where the dominant term becomes exactly with the help of eq.([eqk ] ) : @xmath357 = - x ( 1 - \\frac{2}{\\pi^2 } ) +   \\frac{5}{4 } \\ln x + \\frac{1}{4 } \\ln \\frac{32 } { \\pi } \\ ] ] which is always negative since its maximum , reached for @xmath358 , is -0.107 .",
    "therefore the asymptotic evaluation of @xmath285 shows indeed explicitely that the only order parameters which appears at low temperature are those with an even number of plane waves , in agreement with our exact numerical results .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results to the pairing ring picture explored by bowers and rajagopal @xcite ( br ) in the three dimensional case .",
    "br have looked at the free energy expansion at zero temperature in @xmath359d , extending the work of larkin and ovchinnikov . in the case of multiple plane waves in the order parameter ,",
    "they have pointed out a simple physical interpretation of their results .",
    "their picture is based on the fulde and ferrell study @xcite of a single plane wave order parameter where they showed that one may separate the wavevector space in two complementary domains : the pairing region and the pair breaking region . in the case of a vanishing order parameter and considering only wavevectors at the fermi surface , the pairing region is merely an infinitely thin circle .",
    "it is given by the intersection of the up and down spin fermi surfaces , after shifting one of them by @xmath360 .",
    "the total opening angle of this circle is thereforer given by @xmath361 . in @xmath359d and at @xmath5 , @xmath362 which gives @xmath363 . for a non - zero order parameter amplitude @xmath364 ,",
    "the circle broadens and becomes a ring whose width is given by @xmath365 .",
    "therefore , the pairing region for a single plane wave is a ring drawn on the fermi surface , whose center is on the plane wave direction @xmath366 ( the restriction to the fermi surface is justified by the fact that only wavevectors close to the fermi surface are relevant for pairing ) .    in the case of multiple plane waves in the order parameter",
    ", br showed that the intersection of pairing circles from different plane waves is energetically largely unfavored , the worst case being when two circles are exactly in contact .",
    "the maximisation of the pairing regions leads naturally to increase as much as possible the plane waves number @xmath249 with the constraint that they are no intersecting circles .",
    "this leads to nine circles on the fermi surface .",
    "br rather concluded that the least energy state was the one with eight plane waves for regularity reasons . in particular , this leads to a real order parameter .",
    "we see now that our cascade in @xmath367d is a direct consequence of these two heuristic principles : the no - intersecting circles rule and the maximisation of plane waves .    in @xmath367d ,",
    "the circles are replaced by pairs of points separated by the angle @xmath368 , and the no - intersecting rule becomes now a no - entanglement rule between different pairs . but this is just equivalent to our above finding from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that there is an effective short range repulsion between different wavevectors @xmath369 , with indeed the worst case corresponding to the contact since the maximum of @xmath186 is just below its zero .",
    "the contact condition @xmath370 that we have found ( corresponding to the maximum of @xmath186 ) can be rewritten as @xmath371 which implies @xmath372 .",
    "this is exactly the same as the contact condition of br .",
    "next we have found explicitely that it is indeed favorable to maximize the number of plane waves , taking the short range repulsion into account .",
    "our cascade is due to the fact that , when the temperature goes to zero , @xmath368 also drops to zero and the pairing region for a single plane wave shrinks to a single point , corresponding to the situation where the two up and down fermi circles are just in contact .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the low temperature range for the fflo transition in two dimensions and we have shown that the order parameter is no longer a simple @xmath4 at the second order transition , in contrast with the situation found near the tricritical point . instead the transition is toward more and more complex order parameters when the temperature goes to zero , which gives rise to a cascade with , in principle , an infinite number of transitions . at the transition",
    "these order parameters are in general a superposition of an even number of plane waves with equal weight and equal wavevector modulus , which corresponds to a real order parameter equal to a superposition of cosines .",
    "the directions of these wavevectors are found to be equally spaced angularly , with a spacing which goes to zero when the temperature goes to zero , which is the reason for the ever increasing number of plane waves in this limit .",
    "the singular behaviour in this limit @xmath0 is actually present in all physical quantities .",
    "it arises because , in order to obtain the lowest energy , the two fermi circles corresponding to opposite spins come just in contact when one applies the shift corresponding to the wavevector @xmath360 of the fflo phase .",
    "this is this situation , with these two circles just touching each other , which gives rise to the singularities .",
    "naturally this is linked to the fact that in 2d the fermi surface is actually a line .",
    "hence this singularity is a general feature of 2d physics and we may expect it to give rise to similar consequences in more realistic and more complex models describing actual physical systems .",
    "naturally in this paper we have addressed this remarkable situation in the most simple physical frame .",
    "we have considered the simplest bcs model with isotropic fermi surface , that is a circle for our 2d case . naturally if anisotropy is introduced in the dispersion relation of the electrons , or in the effective electron - electron interaction , or both",
    ", the physics will be more complex . in the same way we expect fermi liquid effects @xcite to bring important quantitative modifications .",
    "similarly if we consider a quasi 2d superconductor with a magnetic field not perfectly aligned with the planes , currents will be produced and orbital contributions to the free energy will arise . however in order to have the physics right in all these complex situations , it is quite clear that one has to obtain the correct limit in the simplest possible case that we have considered in the present paper .",
    "in this section we rederive rapidly our result eq.([leading2 ] ) for the leading order of the optimal wavevector at low temperature , taking the same starting point as bulaevskii @xcite .",
    "we start from eq.11 of ref.@xcite : @xmath373\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we go to our notations by setting @xmath374 and introduce as above our reduced variables @xmath375 and @xmath59 . when we perform the angular integration as in ref .",

    "@xcite ) : @xmath377 we obtain eq.14 of ref . @xcite ( correcting some minor misprints ) .",
    "we can then expand the result to all orders in @xmath205 and show that all the terms in the expansion are zero .",
    "however rather than displaying the steps of this calculation here , it is more convenient to immediately remark that the optimal @xmath378 is obtained by writing that the derivative of eq.11 with respect to @xmath378 is zero .",
    "this provides an equivalent calculation ( we work on the derivative instead of working on the function ) , which is somewhat easier and allows us also to make in the following the direct contact with our result .",
    "this condition on the derivative , which gives the equation for the optimal @xmath378 , is : @xmath379    taking the derivative of the above integral representation , we obtain a corresponding representation for @xmath380 on which the angular integration is easily performed ( the integrals can be found in gradstein and ryzhik @xcite ) .",
    "we display the result by introducing the function @xmath381 and setting @xmath382 , @xmath383 and @xmath384 .",

    "this gives : @xmath394 = 1 + \\sum_{p=1}^{\\infty } \\frac{\\epsilon ^{2p+1}}{(2p ) ! } \\frac{2p}{2p+1 } f ^{(2p+1 ) } ( x_0)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly we can perform the expansion in the integral and expand @xmath395 by introducing the binomial coefficients @xmath396 .",

    "the answer to this puzzle is that the contribution of the terms we have considered is not exactly zero , but exponentially small , which explains why we find it to be zero in a perturbative expansion .",
    "this is shown now in the following .",
    "we start again from the above condition eq.([condition ] ) found for the optimum wavevector .",
    "we transform the integral by shifting the integration contour toward the upper complex plane by @xmath401 for the variable @xmath402 .",
    "first we have to take care that integrant in the above integral has no singularity for @xmath403 , because proper cancellation between various terms .",
    "hence we can also say that this integral is equal to its principal part .",
    "next if we want a complete contour @xmath404 , we have to add to this principal part the contribution of an infinitesimal semi - circle around @xmath405 with positive imaginary part . this contribution is easily found by residues to be equal to @xmath406 , so we have : @xmath407 = - \\frac{\\pi}{2 } { \\rm re}\\ ,   \\int_{c } \\frac{dy}{\\sinh^2 ( \\pi y ) } [ f(x ) - f(x_0 + \\epsilon ( 1 + 2iy ) ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we set @xmath408 and make use of @xmath409 which gives : @xmath410 = \\frac{1}{2 } { \\rm re}\\ , \\int_{-\\infty } ^ { \\infty   } \\frac{dy}{\\cosh^2 z } ( f(x ) - f(x_0 + 2tz/\\bar{q } ) ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the contour runs infinitesimally below the real @xmath411 axis . the first term in the last integral is just equal to @xmath412 , so our equation becomes : @xmath413 = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easily checked that this equation is identical to our eq.([leading ] ) .",
    "note that the fact that the contour runs infinitesimally above or below the real axis is unimportant since we take the real part , and the contribution along the cut due to the square root is purely imaginary .",
    "in conclusion we have obtained our basic equation for the second order term by taking the same starting point as ref .",

    "<S> we explore the nature of the transition to the fulde - ferrell - larkin- ovchinnikov superfluid phases in the low temperature range in two dimensions , for the simplest isotropic bcs model . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by applying the larkin - ovchinnikov approach to this second order transition . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there is a succession of transitions toward ever more complex order parameters when the temperature goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to a cascade with , in principle , an infinite number of transitions . </S>",
    "<S> except for one case , the order parameter at the transition is a real superposition of cosines with equal weights . </S>",
    "<S> the directions of these wavevectors are equally spaced angularly , with a spacing which goes to zero when the temperature goes to zero . </S>",
    "<S> this singular behaviour in this @xmath0 limit is deeply linked to the two - dimensional nature of the problem . </S>"
