    "<S> error bars represent @xmath48 one standard deviation and are obtained based on the statistics of the measured noise variances.,width=321 ]    since mode @xmath34 is coupled to its two nearest neighbors @xmath36 and @xmath37 on each side , one may wonder whether the two neighboring modes can jointly steer @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:3modes ] shows the steerability between one mode and any two other modes of the cluster state , i.e. , ( @xmath61)-mode and ( @xmath62)-mode partitions . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find that mode @xmath34 still can not be steered even by the collaboration of modes @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( @xmath63 ) [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3modes](a ) ] , but can be steered so long as the diagonal mode @xmath35 is involved ( @xmath64 ) [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> fig:3modes(b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is determined unambiguously from a generalized monogamy relation applicable to the case of the steering party consisting of an arbitrary number of modes ( type - ii )  @xcite . as mode @xmath35 can always steer @xmath34 [ shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2modes](b ) ] , the other group \\{@xmath36 , @xmath37 } is forbidden to steer the same mode simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that this property is again in stark contrast to the case of cv four - mode ghz - like state , where any two modes \\{@xmath65 } can collectively steer another mode @xmath66 @xcite as there is no two - mode steering to rule out this possibility . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , mode @xmath36 can only be steered by a group comprising the diagonal mode @xmath37 [ @xmath67 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3modes](a ) , and @xmath68 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3modes](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the collective steerability @xmath69 [ solid curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3modes](b ) ] is significantly higher than the steerability by @xmath35 mode alone @xmath70 [ solid curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2modes](b ) ] , suggesting that although the neighboring modes @xmath36 and @xmath37 can not steer @xmath22 by themselves , their roles in assisting collective steering with mode @xmath35 are non - trivial .    </S>",
    "<S> we further measure , for the first time , the steerability when the steered party comprises more than one mode , i.e. , steering parameters of @xmath71-mode configurations , which are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3modes ] . </S>",
    "<S> the loss imposed on @xmath22 also leads to asymmetric steerability @xmath72 , and a parameter window for one - way steering ( under the restriction of gaussian measurements ) with @xmath73 $ ] , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> fig:3modes(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our results @xmath74 [ @xmath75 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> fig:3modes(a ) ] and @xmath76 when @xmath77 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3modes](b ) ] also confirm experimentally that when the steered system is composed of at least two modes , the type - ii monogamy relation is lifted , such that the system can be steered by more than one party simultaneously  @xcite .    using the results of @xmath71-mode steerability </S>",
    "<S> , we also present the first experimental examination of the type - iii monogamy relation , called coffman - kundu - wootters ( ckw)-type monogamy in reference to the seminal study on monogamy of entanglement @xcite , which quantifies how the steering is distributed among different subsystems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for a three - mode scenario , the ckw - type monogamy relation reads @xmath78where @xmath79 in our case . </S>",
    "<S> we have experimentally verified that this monogamy relation is valid for all possible types of @xmath71-mode steering configurations ; some of them are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3modes](d ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we study the steerability between one and the remaining three modes within the cluster state , i.e. , ( @xmath80)- and @xmath81-mode partitions . as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4modes](a ) , ( b ) , one - way epr steering ( under gaussian measurements ) is observed for bipartitions @xmath82 and @xmath83 when @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the asymmetry between the two steering directions for the bipartition @xmath86 grows with increasing transmission efficiency , but no one - way property is observed in this case [ fig .  [ fig:4modes](c ) ] , since mode @xmath36 and mode @xmath37 can always steer each other independently . </S>",
    "<S> quantitatively , the ( @xmath80)- and @xmath81-mode steerability degrees are further enhanced in comparison to the ( @xmath61)- and @xmath87-mode cases , even when the newly added mode alone can not steer or be steered by the other party . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm that the generalized ckw - type monogamy inequality @xmath88 holds in this four - mode scenario , as shown by the blue curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4modes](d ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , our experiment also validates for the first time general monogamy inequalities for gaussian steerability with an arbitrary number of modes per party ( type - iv )  @xcite . as a typical example of @xmath60-mode steering , </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results demonstrate that the steerability of @xmath89-mode partitions satisfies the following inequalities    [ eq : monogamy ] @xmath90as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4modes](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that both these monogamy relations are also valid for all possible @xmath60-mode configurations in this cluster state . </S>",
    "<S> note that , in general , eq .  ( eq : monogamyb ) can be violated on other classes of states @xcite .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the structure and sharing of epr steering distributed over two- , three- , and four - mode partitions have been demonstrated and investigated quantitatively for a cv four - mode square gaussian cluster state subject to asymmetric loss . by generating the cluster state deterministically and reconstructing its covariance matrix </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a full steering characterization for all bipartite configurations . </S>",
    "<S> for general cases with arbitrary numbers of modes in each party , we quantify the bipartite steerability by gaussian measurements , and provide experimental confirmation for four types of monogamy relations which bound the distribution of steerability among different modes , as summarized in table  [ tablemono ] . </S>",
    "<S> several innovative features are observed , including the steerability of a group of two or three modes by a single mode is demonstrated , and the fact that a given mode of the state can be steered by its diagonal mode which is not directly coupled , but can not be jointly steered by its two directly coupled nearest neighbors . </S>",
    "<S> our work thus provides a concrete in - depth understanding of epr steering in paradigmatic multipartite states such as cluster states , and advances our fundamental knowledge of monogamy relations for gaussian steerability . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , this can be useful in establishing secure teleportation fidelity thresholds , and bounds on 1sdi quantum key distribution and secret sharing among many sites over lossy quantum channels .    </S>",
