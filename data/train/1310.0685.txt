    "strongly correlated electron systems exhibit the highest attained superconducting transition temperatures currently known , and a rich variety of complex electronic phases@xcite .",
    "many compounds among this family of mott insulators , such as the cuprates , are quasi - two - dimensional layered materials .",
    "this renders them ideal candidates for bilayer exciton condensation , which is the topic of this publication .",
    "the effort to achieve the condensation of excitons has a long history starting just after the discovery of bcs theory@xcite .",
    "an exciton is the bound state of an electron and a hole and as such it can bose condense . the obvious advantage of considering excitons above cooper pairs is the strong coulomb attraction between the electron and the hole ; allowing in principle for a much higher critical temperature . to reduce the exciton lifetime problems caused by electron - hole recombination",
    ", it has been suggested to spatially separate the electrons and holes in their own subsequent layers@xcite .",
    "this indeed has resulted in the experimental realization of exciton condensates , first in the so - called quantum hall bilayers@xcite and more recently without an externally applied magnetic field in electrically gated , optically pumped semiconductor quantum wells@xcite .",
    "the successes of exciton condensation in semiconductor 2deg bilayer systems have led to many proposals for exciton condensation in alternative bilayer materials , such as gated topological insulators@xcite or double layer graphene@xcite .",
    "however , these proposals are limited to the bcs paradigm of weak coupling .    on the other hand ,",
    "mott insulators provide a completely different route to exciton condensation@xcite .",
    "naively one would expect that the localization of the electrons and holes leads to a higher critical temperature , since @xmath2 is determined by the competition between the electronic kinetic energy and the electron - hole attraction .",
    "but the physics of exciton condensation in mott insulators is in fact much richer .    instead of the picture that the electron - hole pair lives in a conduction and valence band ,",
    "an exciton now consists of a double occupied and vacant site bound together on an interlayer rung , see figure [ lattice ] . to estimate the binding energy , consider the in - plane charge - transfer excitons which are known to have a binding energy of the order of 1 - 2 ev@xcite .",
    "due to the small interlayer distances of order 1 nm we expect that a similar energy scale will set the binding of the interlayer exciton . as such , excitons in a mott bilayer are most likely in the strongly coupled regime .",
    "side view of a strongly correlated electron bilayer with an exciton present .",
    "the red arrows denote the spin of the localized electrons , and the exciton is a bound state of a double occupied and an empty site . ]",
    "furthermore , a single doublon - holon pair inserted into a mott insulator leads to dynamical frustration effects@xcite , even stronger than seen for a single hole in the @xmath0 model@xcite .",
    "the study of excitons in strongly correlated materials thus catches the complexity of doped mott insulators . as we discussed elsewhere",
    "@xcite the bosonic nature of the excitons actually falls short to completely eliminate all `` fermion - like '' signs : there are still left - over signs of the phase - string type@xcite .",
    "however , it is easy to demonstrate that collinear spin order is a sufficient condition for these signs to cancel out , leaving a truly bosonic dynamics controlling the ground state and long wavelength physics .",
    "the problem thereby reduces to that of hard - core bosons ( the excitons ) in a sign - free spin background .",
    "this is very similar to the `` spin - orbital '' physics described by kugel - khomskii type models@xcite , which can be viewed after all as describing d - d excitons interacting with spins .",
    "also the lattice implementations@xcite of the so(5 ) model@xcite for ( cuprate ) superconductivity are in this family .",
    "such bosonic problems can be handled with standard ( semi - classical ) mean field theory , and therefore the regime of finite exciton density can be addressed in an a - priori controlled manner . in most bilayer exciton set - ups , such as the quantum hall bilayers or the pumped systems , there is no controllable equilibrium exciton density . in these cases",
    "one can hardly speak of the exciton density as a conserved quantity , and exciton condensation in the sense of spontaneously broken @xmath3 symmetry is impossible@xcite .",
    "however , in mott insulators the dopant density per layer could be fixed by , for example , chemical doping .",
    "the effective exciton chemical potential is then by definition large compared to the recombination rate .",
    "effectively , the excitons are at finite density in equilibrium and hence spontaneous @xmath3 symmetry breaking is possible in the mott insulating bilayer .    besides the exciton superfluid phase one anticipates a plethora of competing orders , as is customary in strongly correlated materials . at zero exciton density",
    "the bilayer heisenberg system exhibits already interesting magnetism , in the form of the antiferromagnet for small rung coupling turning via an @xmath4-qnls quantum phase transition into an `` incompressible quantum spin liquid '' for larger rung couplings that can be viewed as a continuation of pair singlets ( `` valence bonds '' ) stacked on the rungs @xcite .",
    "the natural competitor of the exciton superfluid at finite density is the exciton crystal and one anticipates that due to the strong lattice potential this will tend to lock in at commensurate densities forming exciton `` mott insulators '' .",
    "we will wire this in by taking also the exciton - exciton dipolar interaction into account that surely promotes such orderings . in principle",
    "there is the interesting possibility that all these orders may coexist microscopically forming an `` antiferromagnetic supersolid '' @xcite . in this bosonic",
    "setting we can address it in a quite controlled manner , but we find that at least for the strongly coupled `` small '' excitons assumed here this does not happen .",
    "the reason is interesting .",
    "we already alluded to the dynamical `` frustration '' associated with the exciton delocalizing in the anti - ferromagnetic spin background , which is qualitatively of the same kind as for the standard `` electron '' t - j model . at finite densities",
    "this turns into a tendency to just phase separate on a macroscopic scale , involving antiferromagnets , exciton crystalline states and high density diamagnetic exciton superfluids , respectively .",
    "even though the exciton dipolar repulsion is long - ranged , there is no possibility of frustrated phase separation as suggested for the electronic order in cuprates@xcite because the @xmath5 interaction falls off too quickly .",
    "however , if one correctly incorporates the full exciton dipolar interaction , a variety of different exciton ordered phase may arise@xcite . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to nearest neighbor repulsion only , which allows for the formation of a checkerboard ordered exciton crystalline state .",
    "it is disappointing that apparently in this system only conventional ground states occur .",
    "however , this is actually to a degree deceptive .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the physics at the lattice scale describes a physics where the exciton- and spin motions are `` entangled '' : the way in which these subsystems communicate gets beyond the notion of just being strongly coupled , since the motions of the exciton motions and the spin dynamics can not be separated . by coarse graining",
    "this all the way to the static order parameters ( the mean fields ) an effective decoupling eventually results as demonstrated by the pure ground states .",
    "however , upon going `` off - shell '' this spin - exciton entanglement becomes directly manifest in the form of unexpected and rather counterintuitive effects on the excitation spectrum .",
    "a simple example is the zero exciton density antiferromagnet . from the rather controlled linear spin wave self - consistent born approximation ( lsw - scba ) treatment of the one exciton problem",
    "@xcite we already know that the resulting exciton spectrum can be completely different from that in a simple semiconductor .",
    "we compute here the linearized excitations around the pure antiferromagnet , recovering the lsw - scba result in the `` adiabatic limit '' where the exciton hopping is small compared to the exchange energy of the spin system , which leads to a strong enhancement of the exciton mass . in the opposite limit of fast excitons , the energy scale is recovered but the `` ising - confinement '' ladder spectrum revealed by the lsw - scba treatment is absent .",
    "the reason is clear : in the language of this paper , the couplings between the exciton- and spin - wave modes become very big and these need to be re - summed in order to arrive at an accurate description of the exciton propagator , while our mean - field treatment corresponds with a complete neglect of these exciton - spin interactions .",
    "the real novelty in this regard is revealed in the high density exciton superfluid phase .",
    "the spin system forms here a ground state that is a product state of pair - singlets living on the rungs . besides the superfluid phase modes one expects in addition also the usual massive spin - triplet excitations associated with the ( incompressible ) singlet vacuum .",
    "the surprise is that these are characterized by a dispersion which is in part determined by the _ superfluid density of the exciton condensate _ , as we already announced elsewhere@xcite for which we present here the details .",
    "counterintuitively , by measuring the spin fluctuations one can in principle determine whether the excitons are condensed in a superfluid .",
    "let us complete this introduction by specifying the point of departure : the hamiltonian describing strongly bound excitons propagating through a bilayer heisenberg spin 1/2 system .",
    "this model is derived and discussed at length in our earlier papers @xcite and here we just summarize the outcome . due to the strong electron - electron interactions the electronic degrees of freedom",
    "are , at electronic half - filling , reduced to spin operators @xmath6 governed by the bilayer heisenberg model@xcite @xmath7 the subscript denotes spin operators on site @xmath8 in layer @xmath9 .",
    "the heisenberg @xmath10 is antiferromagnetic with @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the interlayer exciton can hop around , thereby interchanging places with the spin background . in the strong - coupling limit of exciton",
    "binding energies the exciton hopping process is described by the hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the exciton state on an interlayer rung , and @xmath15 represent the rung spin states .",
    "whenever an exciton hops , it effectively exchanges the spin configuration on its neighboring site .",
    "this exciton @xmath0 model was derived earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the optical absorption was computed in the limit of vanishing exciton density @xmath16 . in order to study the system with a finite density of excitons , we need to enrich the current @xmath0 model with two extra terms : a chemical potential and an exciton - exciton interaction .    the chemical potential is straightforwardly @xmath17 the exciton - exciton interaction requires more thought .",
    "the bare interaction between two interlayer excitons results from their electric dipole moment . since",
    "all interlayer exciton dipole moments are pointing in the same direction the full exciton - exciton interaction is described by a repulsive @xmath5 interaction .",
    "hence the interaction strength decays sufficiently fast to avoid the coulomb catastrophe responsible for frustrated phase separation@xcite .",
    "we consider it reasonable to only include the nearest - neighbor repulsion , @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the energy scale associated with nearest neighbor exciton repulsion .",
    "this number can get quite high : given a typical interlayer distance@xcite of @xmath20 and an intersite distance of @xmath21 the bare dipole interaction energy is 14 ev . in reality",
    ", we expect this energy to be lower due to quantum corrections and screening effects .",
    "however , the exciton - exciton interaction scale remains on the order of electronvolts and thus larger than the estimated heisenberg @xmath22 and hopping @xmath23 .",
    "let us finally consider the effects of interlayer hopping of electrons , which leads to the annihilation of excitons , @xmath24 this term explicitly breaks the @xmath3 symmetry associated with the conservation of excitons . while this term is almost certainly present in any realistic system",
    ", it is a matter of numbers whether it is relevant . in the present case of cuprates , where each layer can be doped by means of chemical substitution",
    ", we expect the chemical potential @xmath25 to be significantly larger than the interlayer tunneling @xmath26 .",
    "consequently , the interlayer hopping is barely relevant . throughout this publication",
    "we will discuss the effects that the inclusion of a small @xmath26 will have .",
    "the full model hamiltonian describing a finite density of excitons in a strongly correlated bilayer is thus @xmath27    let us now summarize the layout of our paper .",
    "most of the physics of hard - core excitons on a lattice can be captured using an effective @xmath1 model , which is studied in section [ secxxz ] .",
    "the ground state phase diagram of the full exciton @xmath0 model is derived in section [ secmft ] , using both numerical simulations and analytical mean field theory .",
    "the excitations and the corresponding susceptibilities are discussed in section [ seceex ] .",
    "we conclude this paper with a discussion on possible further lines of theoretical and experimental research in section [ secconc ] .",
    "the hamiltonian , equation ( [ fullh ] ) , has five model parameters : @xmath22 , @xmath28 , @xmath23 , @xmath19 and @xmath25 .",
    "however , most properties of the excitons can be understood by considering the problem of hard - core bosons on a lattice . in this section",
    "we will argue that the exciton degrees of freedom can be described by an effective @xmath1 model .",
    "based on some reflections on the mathematical symmetries of the full exciton @xmath0 model , we will describe the properties of this effective @xmath1 model in subsection [ subsecxxz1 ] .",
    "we will conclude this section with an outline of the method used to obtain the excitation spectrum of the model .      before characterizing different phases of the model we need to assess the algebraic structure of the exciton @xmath0 model .",
    "the set of all operators that act on the local hilbert space form the _ dynamical algebra _ , whereas the symmetries of the system are grouped together in the _ symmetry algebra_.    to derive the dynamical algebra , it is instructive to start with the bilayer heisenberg model which has , on each interlayer rung , a @xmath29 dynamical algebra@xcite .",
    "upon inclusion of the exciton hopping term we need more operators , since now the local hilbert space on an interlayer rung is five - dimensional ( four spin states and the exciton ) . consider the spin - to - exciton operator @xmath30 and its conjugate @xmath31 .",
    "their commutator reads @xmath32 = |e \\rangle \\langle e | - | s\\ ; m \\rangle \\langle s \\ ; m",
    "|          \\equiv 2 e^z_{sm}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the operator @xmath33 to complete a @xmath34 algebraic structure .",
    "we could set up such a construction for each of the four spin states @xmath15 . under these definitions",
    "the exciton hopping term , equation ( [ excitonhop ] ) , can be rewritten in terms of an @xmath35-model for each spin state , @xmath36 where the sum over @xmath37 runs over the singlet and the three triplets .",
    "note that the exciton chemical potential , equation ( [ hmu ] ) , acts as an externally applied magnetic field to this @xmath35-model , and that the exciton - exciton repulsion , equation ( [ hv ] ) , can be rewritten as an antiferromagnetic ising term in the @xmath33 operators .",
    "the dynamical algebra therefore contains four @xmath34 algebras in addition to the @xmath38 from the bilayer heisenberg part .",
    "the closure of such an algebra is necessarily @xmath39 , which is the largest algebra possible acting on the five - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "hence we need a full @xmath39 dynamical algebra to describe the exciton @xmath0 model at finite density .",
    "the operators that compose this algebra are enumerated in appendix [ appendixa ] .    from the @xmath35-representation of the hopping term",
    "one can already deduce that we have four distinct @xmath3 symmetries associated with spin - exciton exchange .",
    "the bilayer heisenberg model contains two separate @xmath34 symmetries , associated with in - phase and out - phase interlayer magnetic order .",
    "therefore the full symmetry algebra of the model is @xmath40 ^ 2 \\times [ u(1)]^4 $ ] .",
    "breaking of the @xmath34 symmetry amounts to magnetic ordering , which is most likely antiferromagnetic ( and therefore also amounts to a breaking of the lattice symmetry ) .",
    "each of the @xmath3 algebras can be broken leading to exciton condensation .",
    "note that next to possible broken continuous symmetries , there also might exist phases with broken translation symmetry .",
    "the checkerboard phase , already anticipated in the introduction , is an example of a phase where the lattice symmetry is broken into two sublattices .      when discussing the dynamical algebra of the exciton @xmath0 model we found that the exciton hopping terms are similar to an @xmath35-model .",
    "the main reason is that the excitons are , in fact , hard - core bosons and thus allow for a mapping onto pseudospin degrees of freedom . viewed as such , the exciton - exciton interaction equation ( [ hv ] ) is similar to an antiferromagnetic ising term and the exciton chemical potential equation ( [ hmu ] ) amounts to an external magnetic field in the @xmath41-direction .",
    "together they form an @xmath1-model in the presence of an external field , which has been investigated in quite some detail elsewhere@xcite as well as in the context of exciton dynamics in cold atom gases@xcite .    in order to understand the basic competition between the checkerboard phase and the superfluid phase of the excitons , it is worthwhile to neglect the magnetic degrees of freedom and study first this effective @xmath1-model for the excitons only .",
    "the transition between the checkerboard and superfluid phases is known as the ` spin flop'-transition@xcite . keeping the identification of the exciton degrees of freedom as @xmath1 pseudospin degrees of freedom in mind ,",
    "let us review the basics of the @xmath1 hamiltonian @xmath42 where @xmath43 creates a hard - core bosonic particle @xmath44 out of the vacuum @xmath45 .",
    "this model has a built - in competition between @xmath46 , which favors a superfluid state , and @xmath47 , which favors a crystalline state where all particles are on one sublattice and the other sublattice is empty .",
    "the external field or chemical potential @xmath25 tunes the total particle density .",
    "the ground state can now be found using mean field theory .",
    "it is known that for pseudospin @xmath48 models in @xmath49d the quantum fluctuations are not strong enough to defeat classical order and therefore we can rely on mean field theory , as supported by exact diagonalization studies@xcite .    to find",
    "the ground state we introduce a variational wavefunction describing a condensate of excitons , @xmath50 the mean - field approximation amounts to choosing @xmath51 constant and @xmath52 only differing between the two sublattices .",
    "we find the following mean - field energy @xmath53 let s rewrite this in terms of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56    when @xmath57 the ground state is fully polarized in the @xmath41-direction .",
    "this means either zero particle density for negative @xmath25 , or a @xmath58 for the positive @xmath25 case .",
    "starting from the empty side , increasing @xmath25 introduces a smooth distribution of particles .",
    "this phase amounts to the superfluid phase of the excitons .",
    "the particle density on the two sublattices is equal and the total density is given by @xmath59 at the critical value of the chemical potential @xmath60 a first order transition occurs towards the checkerboard phase : the spin flop transition . in the resulting phase , which goes under various names such as the antiferromagnetic model . to avoid confusion , from now on we will use the term antiferromagnetism only when referring to the spin degrees of freedom in the full exciton @xmath0 model . ] , solid , checkerboard or wigner crystalline phase",
    ", the sublattice symmetry is broken .",

    "the graph shows the mean field particle density @xmath61 as a function of @xmath25 , with model parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "one clearly distinguishes the fully polarized phases for large @xmath25 , the superfluid phase with a linear @xmath61 vs @xmath25 dependence and the crystalline checkerboard phase with @xmath64 . in between the checkerboard and the superfluid phase a non -",

    "we indeed see the checkerboard phase and the superfluid phase , as well as a high - temperature non - ordered ` normal ' phase . ]    at finite temperatures in @xmath49d there can be algebraic long - range order . at some critical temperature",
    "a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition@xcite will destroy this long - range order .",
    "the topology of the phase diagram however can be obtained using the finite temperature mean field theory for which we need to minimize the mean field thermodynamic potential@xcite @xmath66      \\nonumber \\\\ & &       - \\frac{\\mu}{2 } \\tanh \\left ( \\frac{\\beta m}{2 } \\right )           \\cos \\delta \\theta \\cos \\overline{\\theta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] expectation values are @xmath67 and the parameter @xmath68 needs to be determined self - consistently .",
    "the resulting phase diagram is shown in figure [ figxxz]b , which is of the form discussed by fisher and nelson@xcite .",
    "the first order quantum phase transition at @xmath69 turns out to be non - trivial , a point which is usually overlooked in the literature .",
    "a trivial first order transition occurs when there are two distinct phases with exactly the same energy . in the case",
    "presented here , there is a infinite set of mean field order parameters all yielding different phases yet still having the same energy .",
    "a simple analytic calculation shows that the energy of the ground state at the critical point is @xmath70 .",

    "this has interesting consequences .",
    "if one can control the density instead of the chemical potential around a first order transition , in general phase separation would occur between the two competing phases . from the mean field considerations above it",
    "is unclear what would happen in a system described by the @xmath1 hamiltonian , equation ( [ xxzmodel ] ) .",
    "all phases would be equally stable , at least on the mean field level , and every phase may occur in regions of any size .",
    "such a highly degenerate state may be very sensible to small perturbations .",
    "we consider it an interesting open problem to study the dynamics of such a highly degenerate system , and whether this degeneracy may survive the inclusion of quantum corrections .    in the introduction we mentioned the existence of interlayer hopping , equation ( [ interlayerhopping ] ) .",
    "qualitatively the @xmath26 is irrelevant , which can be seen in the @xmath1 pseudospin language where it takes the form of a tilt of the magnetic field in the @xmath78-direction , @xmath79 as a result the phase diagram is shifted but not qualitatively changed .",
    "the effect of the @xmath26 on the excitation spectrum is briefly discussed in section [ sfphasesection ] .      of direct experimental relevance",
    "are the elementary excitations of a phase .",
    "the dispersion of these excitations can be computed using the ` equations of motion'-method based on the work of zubarev@xcite .",
    "we present the formalities of this method in appendix [ appendixc ] . in this subsection",
    "we briefly show the essence of this technique , applied to the @xmath1 model .",
    "later , in section [ seceex ] , we will compute the excitations for the full exciton @xmath0 model .",
    "the key ingredients of this zubarev - approach are the heisenberg equations of motion , @xmath80 where @xmath81 runs over all nearest neighbors .",
    "these equations can not be solved exactly , and one relies on the approximation controlled by the mean field vacua .",
    "that is , we neglect fluctuations of the order parameters , so that products of operators on different sites are replaced by@xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 denotes the mean field expectation value . by such a decoupling",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion become a coupled set of linear equations which can be solved easily . in the homogeneous phase",
    "we thus obtain , after fourier transforming , @xmath84 we find an analytical expression for the excitations in the superfluid phase , @xmath85 where @xmath86 . for small momenta",
    "this excitation has a linear dispersion , conform to the goldstone theorem requiring a massless excitation as a result of the spontaneously broken @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "exactly at @xmath87 the dispersion reduces to @xmath88 , hence the gap at @xmath89 closes thus signaling a transition towards the checkerboard phase .    at the critical point and in the checkerboard phase , we need to take into account the fact that expectation values of operators differ on the two sublattices .",
    "the heisenberg equations of motion now reduce to six ( instead of three ) linear equations , which can be straightforwardly solved .",
    "for now we postpone the discussion on the dispersion of elementary excitations to section [ seceex ] , where the full exciton @xmath0 model will be considered using the technique discussed here .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the effective @xmath1 model predicts the existence of both an exciton superfluid phase and a checkerboard phase , separated by a first order transition .",
    "now we derive the ground state phase diagram for the full exciton @xmath0 model given by equation ( [ fullh ] ) .",
    "we will proceed along the same lines as in the previous section , starting with a variational wavefunction .",
    "numerical simulation of this wavefunction creates an unbiased view on the possible inhomogeneous and homogeneous ground state phases .",
    "this serves as a basis to further analyze the phase diagram with analytical methods .",
    "the analytical mean field theory also allows us to characterize the three homogeneous phases : the antiferromagnet , the superfluid and the checkerboard crystal . finally , combining the numerical and analytical mean field results we obtain the ground state phase diagram , see figure [ finalphasediagramfig ] .",
    "recall that the local hilbert space consists of four spin states @xmath15 and the exciton state @xmath14 .",
    "we therefore propose a variational wavefunction consisting of a product state of a superposition of all five states on each rung .",
    "for the spin states we take the @xmath38 coherent state@xcite @xmath90 which needs to be superposed with the exciton state , @xmath91 to obtain the total variational ( product state ) wavefunction @xmath92 this full wavefunction acts as ansatz for the numerical simulations . note that the homogeneous phases can be described by this wavefunction with the parameters @xmath93 and @xmath76 only depending on the sublattice .",
    "given this wavefunction , the expectation value of a product of operators on different sites decouples , @xmath94 .",
    "the only nonzero expectation values of spin operators are for @xmath95 and it equals @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the unit vector described by the angles @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "this variational wavefunction therefore assumes interlayer nel order of magnitude @xmath100 , which enables us to correctly interpolate between the perfect nel order at @xmath101 and the singlet phase @xmath102 present in the bilayer heisenberg model .",
    "the exciton density at a rung @xmath8 is trivially given by @xmath103 .",
    "given the variational wavefunction , we can use simulated annealing to develop an unbiased view on the possible mean field ground state phases .",
    "therefore we start out with a lattice with on each lattice site the variables @xmath52 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath51 and @xmath103 and with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "the fixed total exciton density is imposed as follows : if during an update the exciton density @xmath103 is changed , the exciton density on one of the neighboring sites is corrected such that the total exciton density remains constant .",
    "the main results of the simulation are shown in figure [ mcresults ] , for various values of the hopping parameter @xmath23 and exciton density @xmath76 .",
    "we performed the computations on a @xmath107 lattice .",
    "notice that even though true long - range order does not exist in two dimensions , the correlation length of possible ordered phases is larger than the size of our simulated lattice .",
    "the other parameters are fixed at @xmath108 mev , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ev . the heisenberg couplings @xmath108 mev and @xmath109 are obtained from measurements of undoped ybco - samples@xcite , which we consider to be qualitatively indicative of all strongly correlated electron bilayers .",
    "the dipolar coupling is estimated at 2 ev , following our discussion in the introduction .",
    "for each value of @xmath76 and @xmath23 we started at a high temperature @xmath111 ev , to slowly reduce the temperature to @xmath112 ev while performing a full update of the whole lattice 10 million times .",
    "we expect that by such a slow annealing process we obtain the true ground state of equation ( [ scenergy ] ) , devoid of topological defects .",
    "once we arrive at the low temperature state , we performed measurements employing 200.000 full updates of the system .",
    "results from the semi - classical monte carlo simulations . here shown are color plots , with on the horizontal axes the exciton density @xmath76 and on the vertical axes the hopping parameter @xmath23 ( in ev ) .",

    "the large exciton kinetic energy together with the relatively spin dynamics create an effective potential for the exciton : the exciton becomes localized and the confinement generates a ladder spectrum . note that thus in the antiadiabatic regime the free results ( * a. * , * c. * ) can not be trusted .",
    "]    in the limit of zero exciton density we recover the well - known bilayer heisenberg physics@xcite . as discussed in section [ ssgrandcanonical ] , the spins tend to order antiferromagnetically .",
    "the excitations spectrum thus contains a goldstone spin wave with linear dispersion around @xmath192 and a similar mode centered around @xmath202 .",
    "in addition , the bilayer nature is reflected in the presence of two longitudinal spin waves with a gap of order @xmath194 and a narrow bandwidth of order @xmath28 .",
    "the excitation spectrum and the corresponding magnetic dynamical susceptibility is shown in figure [ afspinwaves ] .",
    "since the spin modes of the bilayer antiferromagnet are independent of any exciton degrees of freedom , we will not discuss these any further .",
    "the dynamics of an isolated exciton in an antiferromagnetic background has been studied extensively by means of a linear spin - wave self - consistent born approximation technique ( lsw - scba)@xcite .",
    "the non - interacting equations of motion method used in this paper , amounts to the complete neglect of exciton - spin interactions , while these are on the foreground of the ( resummed ) lsw - scba computation .",
    "however , the mere existence of lsw - scba results allows us to compare it with our current non - interacting calculations .",
    "let us therefore first go through the lsw - scba results .",
    "there we need to distinguish between two limits : the adiabatic limit with @xmath196 shown in figure [ afadiabatic ] , and the anti - adiabatic limit where @xmath200 shown in figure [ afantiadiabatic ] .",
    "consider a single exciton in an antiferromagnetic background . now",
    "if this exciton hops to a neighboring site , it will leave behind two spins that are ferromagnetically aligned with their neighbors .",
    "this process is called dynamical frustration and limits severely the motion of an exciton . in the adiabatic limit ( @xmath196 )",
    "this causes the exciton bandwidth to be drastically reduced to an order @xmath199 .",
    "in addition , the magnetic background acts as a confining potential leading to small but detectable ladder states at higher energies .    at the other hand , in the anti - adiabatic regime",
    "@xmath200 exciton hopping will destroy the antiferromagnetic order as it will be surrounded by a cloud of frustrated spins .",
    "the quasiparticle picture completely breaks down and the spectral weight of the exciton is redistributed to a wide incoherent spectral bump . the ladder spectrum arising from the effective confinement will still be visible , though smeared out .",
    "the equations - of - motion method however ignores the effects of spin - exciton interactions such as dynamical frustration .",
    "it treats the excitons as well - defined quasiparticles .",
    "as such we can already guess beforehand that the non - interacting results will be reliable in the adiabatic regime . indeed , in the equations - of - motion method we find four exciton modes corresponding to either the singlet @xmath203 or @xmath204 triplet exciton @xmath205 operator , just as in the lsw - scba .",
    "when @xmath206 we can write out an analytical expression for the non - interacting dispersions , @xmath207 where each branch is twofold degenerate .",

    "the dispersions , equation ( [ excdispersion ] ) , indeed result in an effective exciton bandwidth of order @xmath199 , conform the fully interacting theory as can be seen in figure [ afadiabatic ] . the natural question",
    "then arises : how is it possible that in the present non - interacting theory the exciton bandwidth depends on the spin parameter @xmath22 ? for sure , the effective exciton model introduced in section [ secxxz ] has no such renormalization as is shown in figure [ afadiabatic ] .",
    "there the exciton bandwidth fully depends on @xmath209 .    however , it is important to realize that the exciton operators @xmath210 do not commute with the antiferromagnetic order parameter operator @xmath211 . as a result the mean field energy of exciting an exciton is shifted either up or down ( depending on the sublattice ) yielding a gap between the two exciton branches of @xmath212 .",
    "now for small @xmath23 , propagation of the exciton requires that one has to pay the energy shift @xmath194 to move through both sublattices . as a result",
    "the effective hopping is reduced by a factor @xmath168 .",
    "therefore the exciton bandwidth renormalization , seen in the full lsw - scba , is already present at the mean field level .",
    "for large @xmath168 however we will pay a price for the convenience of the non - interacting equations of motion method . at",
    "the mean field level one still expects the dispersions to be described by equation ( [ excdispersion ] ) .",
    "however , upon inclusion of the interaction corrections this picture breaks down completely .",
    "the bandwidth of the non - interacting exciton is of order @xmath209 , whereas in the interacting theory an incoherent ladder spectrum of the same width arises .",
    "thus for large @xmath168 the non - interacting results can not be trusted .",
    "however , this only applies to the antiferromagnetic phase due to the presence of dynamical frustration . in general",
    ", it appears that the non - interacting results are qualitatively correct in the absence of gapless modes that need to be excited in order for an exciton to move .",
    "this condition is naturally met for the other two phases .",
    "we therefore expect that exciton - spin interactions only lead to qualitative changes in the antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "by simple selection rules one can already conclude that the singlet exciton mode couples to light . as a consequence",
    "this is the mode that is visible in the charge dynamical susceptibility , which is related to the polarization propagator .",
    "the exciton excitations are shown in figures [ afadiabatic]d ( for @xmath213 ) and [ afantiadiabatic]d ( for @xmath214 ) .",

    "these modes have a gap of order @xmath28 and a bandwidth of order @xmath194 .",
    "* c , d . * in contrast to the simple heisenberg results , the actual triplet modes have enhanced kinetics@xcite .",
    "the modes are split in a spin - dominated branch with small gap and large bandwidth proportional to the superfluid density ( * e , f . * ) ; and an exciton - dominated branch with a large gap and a small bandwidth ( * g , h . * ) . ]",
    "the mode spectrum of superfluid phase , as shown in figures [ ec - exciton ] and [ ec - spin ] , is characterized by a linearly dispersing goldstone mode associated with the broken @xmath3 symmetry .",
    "this superfluid phase mode has vanishing energy at the @xmath192 point , where we find the inescapable linear dispersion relation @xmath218 the speed of the superfluid phase mode is the same as for the @xmath1 model in equation ( [ xxzsuperfluidspeed ] ) up to a rescaling of the @xmath23 and @xmath19 parameters .",
    "indeed , this speed is proportional to the superfluid density @xmath219 .",
    "this mode can be seen in the charge susceptibility , figures [ ec - exciton]e and f. the goldstone mode has a gap at @xmath202 which decreases monotonically with increasing exciton density . precisely at the first order transition towards the checkerboard phase",
    "this gap closes .",
    "this mode softening at @xmath202 is reminiscent of the roton in superfluid helium : the wavelength of the roton is the same as the lattice constant of solid helium .",
    "next to the goldstone mode there are two triplet excitations , shown in figure [ ec - spin ] , each one three - fold degenerate .",
    "the degeneracy obviously arises from the standard triplet degeneracy @xmath220 .",
    "the two branches however distinguish between _ exciton - dominated _ modes and _ spin - dominated _ modes , let us discuss them separately .",
    "the spin - dominated modes have a gap of order @xmath221 , which is similar to the triplet gap in the bilayer heisenberg model for large @xmath171 . however , the bandwidth of these excitations scales with @xmath23 rather than with @xmath22 , as would be customary in a system without exciton condensation ( see figures [ ec - spin]a and b ) .",
    "we discussed this in great detail in recent work@xcite , so let us briefly review these results . in the absence of a excitons the motion of triplets is governed by the heisenberg superexchange yielding a bandwidth of order @xmath22 .",
    "now introduce fock operators @xmath222 and @xmath223 , so that the exciton - triplet exchange equation ( [ excitonhop ] ) reads @xmath224 this is an interaction term , thus seemingly irrelevant to the bandwidth of the triplet .",
    "however , when the exciton condensation sets in the operator @xmath225 obtains an expectation value , in fact @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the condensate density .",
    "therefore the higher order exchange term yields a quadratic triplet hopping term @xmath228 and the bandwidth of the triplet excitations becomes of order @xmath229 .",
    "now remember that the exciton hopping energy @xmath23 resulted , in second order perturbation theory , from the ratio @xmath230 where @xmath231 is the electron hopping energy and @xmath232 is the nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion@xcite .",
    "the heisenberg coupling however was given by @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the onsite coulomb repulsion . since for obvious reasons",
    "@xmath235 , we find that the triplet bandwidth is enhanced whenever exciton condensation sets is .",
    "this enhancement is clearly visible in the spin susceptibility @xmath236 , which allows for an experimental probe of the exciton superfluid density .",
    "the other branch of triplet excitations is dominated by triplet excitons , and is therefore barely visible in the spin susceptibility and not visible in the exciton susceptibility ( which only shows singlet excitons ) . that it is indeed dominated by triplet excitons",
    "can be inferred from computing the matrix elements of the operator @xmath237 , which are shown in figures [ ec - spin]g and h. furthermore , the gap @xmath238 is a function of exciton model parameters only .",
    "the bandwidth of this mode is of order @xmath239 , relatively independent of the exciton density . as a result , for large superfluid densities the exciton - dominated modes cross the spin - dominated triplet modes .",
    "one can directly see this in the excitation spectrum for @xmath217 as shown in figure [ ec - spin]d .",
    "we can compare the triplet spectrum to the mode spectrum of the singlet phase of the bilayer heisenberg model .",
    "when @xmath240 the ground state consists of only rung singlets .",
    "the excitation towards a triplet state , shown in figures [ ec - spin]a and b , has a gap @xmath241 and a bandwidth of order @xmath194 , which is considerably smaller than the @xmath239 bandwidth in the condensate .",
    "however , because the topology of the triplet mode is the same we expect that the effect of the spin - exciton interactions is the same in the bilayer heisenberg model as for the superfluid . since earlier lsw - scba showed no changes in the spectrum due to interactions , we infer that the non - interacting results for the superfluid are reliable .    to conclude our discussion of the excitations of the superfluid phase let us consider the influence of the interlayer tunneling .",
    "in the context of the @xmath1 model we noticed that interlayer tunneling has no qualitative influence on the phase diagram itself . however , the presence of a weak interlayer tunneling may act as potential pinningthe phase@xcite opening a gap in the superfluid phase mode spectrum of order @xmath242 .",
    "persistent currents can still exist , but one needs to overcome this gap in order to get the exciton supercurrent flowing .       the excitation spectrum of the checkerboard phase .",

    "the excitation of removing an exciton can propagate through the checkerboard . *",
    "d. * the propagating mode that changes an exciton into a singlet is detectable by optical means and thus shows up in the charge susceptibility . ]",
    "the third homogeneous phase of the exciton @xmath0 model is the checkerboard phase . in this phase the unit cell",
    "is effectively doubled with one exciton per unit cell .",
    "this state is analogous to a bose mott insulator .",
    "the trivial excitations are then the doublon and the holon : create two bosons per unit cell which costs an energy @xmath243 or to remove the boson .",
    "the latter will generate a propagating exciton mode , with dispersion @xmath244 there are two such propagating modes : one associated with the singlet exciton and one with the triplet exciton . precisely at the transition towards the superfluid phase , one of these exciton waves",
    "becomes gapless .",
    "note that the arguments that lead to the bandwidth renormalization in the antiferromagnetic phase also apply here , leading to an exciton bandwidth of order @xmath245 .",
    "the dispersions and the corresponding charge dynamical susceptibility can be seen in figure [ dispersionfigcb ] .    in the spin sector",
    "one can excite a localized spin triplet on the empty sublattice .",
    "the triplet gap is set by the interlayer energy @xmath28 , and the dispersion is flat because this triplet can not propagate , as can be seen in figure [ dispersionfigcb]b .",
    "we have studied the possibility of exciton condensation in strongly correlated electron bilayers .",
    "starting from the description of the mott state , with localized electrons , an exciton is defined as an interlayer bound state of a double occupied and vacant site . in the strong coupling limit , as of relevance to laboratory systems based on mott insulators , the physics of such a system is described by the exciton @xmath0 model , equation ( [ fullh ] ) .",
    "we constructed the ground state phase diagram ( figure [ finalphasediagramfig ] ) , based on both numerical simulations and analytical mean field theory .",
    "three distinct phases are dominant : the antiferromagnetic phase , the checkerboard phase and the exciton condensate . for most parts of the phase diagram",
    "however , macroscopic phase separation will occur between these three phases .",
    "measurements of the spin and charge susceptibilities may discern in which one of the three main phases a specific system is in . the antiferromagnetic phase is characterized by a spin wave centered at @xmath202 , whilst in the exciton condensate the triplet bandwidth acts as a probe for the superfluid density ( see figure [ ec - spin ] and ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the checkerboard phase the spin degrees of freedom",
    "are reflected only in a localized triplet excitation at low energy .",
    "the charge dynamic susceptibility shows distinct qualitative behavior depending on the phase . in the antiferromagnet",
    "the spin - exciton interactions play an important role @xcite .",
    "the superfluid phase is characterized by the visibility of the condensate goldstone mode , whereas the checkerboard phase has propagating exciton waves with bandwidth @xmath246 .",
    "note however that since we expect phase separation to occur for most model parameters , realistic samples will likely display features from all phases in its susceptibilities .",
    "our theoretical work presented here is largely based on the assumption of strong coupling . in this limit ,",
    "the excitons behave as local hard - core bosons .",
    "if the exciton binding energy is less dominant , the exciton will extend over more lattice sites and thus probably enable coexistence phases .",
    "on the other hand we expect that spin - exciton interactions destabilize the coexistence phases , since these interactions generally lead to frustration effects .",
    "one could also wonder what happens if one includes longer - ranged interactions for the excitons , with the possibility of exciton stripes and incommensurate charge ordered phases@xcite .",
    "next , we are dealing with first order phase transitions where small changes may have severe consequences . combining all these effects may lead to significant changes in the phase diagram , most notably in the regime where we predict phase separation .    within the context of the strongly coupled exciton @xmath0 model",
    ", a weaker exciton binding energy can be incorporated via interaction and hopping terms for the next nearest neighbors , next next nearest neighbors , etcetera .",
    "this might lead to complex ordered phases such as stripes@xcite .",
    "such phases are found in many strongly correlated electron systems@xcite , and studying these in the context of the simple bosonic exciton @xmath0 model might shed new light on the more troublesome fermionic @xmath0 model .",
    "in addition to stripy behavior other non - trivial exciton density profiles may occur when one considers a density imbalance between the electrons and holes .",
    "semiconductor imbalanced systems are predicted to exhibit fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov density modulated phases@xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to investigate whether such phase can exist in strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "next to an improvement of the phase diagram , we can also improve the susceptibilities by including the effect of exciton - spin interactions .",
    "similar to our earlier work @xcite on the interaction between excitons and spins in the limit of a single exciton , one could perform a diagrammatic expansion of these interactions .",
    "we expect that , apart from our earlier results in the antiferromagnetic phase , inclusion of spin - exciton interactions will not qualitatively alter the excitation spectra .",
    "experimentally , the close coupling of p- and n - doped mott insulators is still relatively ill explored .",
    "however , important advances in complex oxide thin film growth , by techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) and pulsed laser deposition ( pld ) equipped with in situ monitoring tools such as reflective high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) are making it possible now to grow multilayers of perovskite oxides - of which many are mott insulators - with unit cell precision . a complicating factor in fabricating multilayers of p- and n - doped perovskites , like the cuprate family from which also the high - tc superconductors are derived ,",
    "are the oftentimes conflicting ( de)-oxygenation requirements .",
    "optimized deposition and post - anneal procedures have made it possible however to make thin film contacts between n- and p - doped superconducting cuprates @xcite , which is now further being explored in our labs to create and study the parallel n - p combinations resembling the theoretical model .",
    "an interesting additional system that can be included in this endeavor is the 2-dimensional electron gas that is formed at the interfaces between selected oxide band - insulators such as srtio@xmath247 and laalo@xmath247 . in this respect",
    "it is noteworthy that in specific configurations , in particular a 1 unit cell srtio@xmath247 layer on top of a 2 unit cell laalo@xmath247 layer grown on tio@xmath248-terminated srtio@xmath249 , a system of a closely coupled 2-dimensional electron gas and a 2-dimensional hole gas has been realized @xcite .",
    "finally we note that some cuprate high - tc materials appear to have an intrinsic stacking of electron - doped and hole - doped cuo@xmath248 layers , such as ba@xmath248ca@xmath247cu@xmath250o@xmath251f@xmath248 @xcite , where one could look for excitonic effects .",

    "finally , notice that we have one operator too much in our listing , since there are only 24 operators in @xmath39 .",

    "in this appendix we elaborate a bit further on the heisenberg equations of motion method , as introduced in paragraph [ xxzexc ] .",
    "the aim of this method is to find the spectrum of excitations , building on the foundations given by the mean field approximation .",

    "we employ the notation that @xmath8 indicates the lattice site , and @xmath277 is the index denoting the type of operator .",
    "the right hand side of this equation contains products of operators at different lattice sites .",
    "such products can be decoupled within the mean field approximation as @xcite @xmath278 where @xmath8 and @xmath279 are different lattice sites . upon fourier transforming lattice position into momentum and time into energy , we thus obtain a set of linear equations for the operators , @xmath280 the spectrum of excitations is simply found by solving this eigenvalue equation for the matrix @xmath281 .    in order to find",
    "the matrix elements @xmath282 that enter in susceptibilities we need will introduce the following scheme .",
    "assume that the hamiltonian is of the form @xmath283 where the sum over @xmath284 runs over momenta , and @xmath285 indicates the different excited states . now @xmath286 is a creation operator , and irrespective of whether we are dealing with fermions or bosons we have the following equations of motion @xmath287 that is : every eigenvector of @xmath288 corresponding to a negative eigenvalue can be identified as a creation operator for one of the elementary excitations .",
    "however , the eigenvalue equation itself is not enough because it does not yield the proper normalization of @xmath289 .",
    "since we have the eigenvector solution @xmath290 we can write out the ( anti)commutation relation for @xmath286 in terms of the ( anti)commutation relations for the @xmath291 . upon requiring that on the mean field level the operators @xmath286 obey canonical commutation relations , that is for bosons @xmath292 \\rangle = \\delta_{nn'},\\ ] ] we obtain a proper normalization for the new creation operators .",
    "we can invert the normalized matrix @xmath293 to express @xmath291 in terms of the creation operators @xmath286 . finally , using @xmath294",
    "we can compute the wanted matrix element for @xmath291 .    as an example of this technique we can compute the matrix element @xmath295 for the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a square lattice .",
