    "the wilson ope is one of the standard tools in modern hadronic physics .",
    "the ope provides the framework for systematically separating short - distance contributions ( @xmath0 ) . ] from long - distance contributions ( @xmath1 ) . for illustration",
    "consider the large - momentum expansion of the correlator of a gauge - invariant qcd current @xmath2  @xcite , @xmath3 & & \\mbox{\\hspace{13 mm } } q^2\\sum_{n=0}\\sum_{l=1}^{l_n}\\,c_{nl}(q^2)\\,\\langle o_{nl}(0)\\rangle \\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 runs over the dimension of the _ local _ and gauge - invariant composite operators @xmath5 , and @xmath6 labels operators of the same dimensions .",
    "the long - distance fluctuations are encoded in the matrix elements @xmath7 , also called condensates , and the short - distance contributions are contained in the wilson coefficients @xmath8 .",
    "one has the scaling @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath11 term is entirely perturbative and higher order terms in the series are of order @xmath12 . for the case",
    "@xmath13 the expansion should be reasonably well - behaved , but it is known to be asymptotic .",
    "there are situations where the ope can not be applied or where it can not give definite answers .",
    "when @xmath14 approaches @xmath15 , the series breaks down .",
    "the ope can also not answer questions related to the asymptotics of the series due to the truncation of the series . in this talk",
    "i discuss a generalization of the local ope that has been proposed in ref.@xcite and has been called `` delocalized operator expansion '' ( doe ) .",
    "the doe is an attempt to combine the advantages of the ope with methods that might be useful to resolve issues that can not be tackled easily in the framework of the ope .",
    "given the exact knowledge of ( nonlocal ) gauge - invariant qcd vacuum correlators and assuming for now that perturbative propagation can be factorized unambiguously from nonperturbative fluctuations , one may view the ope as the multipole expansion of the perturbative part . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the simplified case of a nonperturbative and nonlocal dimension-4 structure @xmath16 corresponding to a _ slowly varying _ 2-point correlator falling off at distance @xmath17 in its euclidean space - time argument @xmath18 .",
    "in addition , we consider a perturbative short - distance function @xmath19 , that probes the vacuum at distance @xmath20 . for @xmath13 ,",
    "@xmath19 is _ strongly peaked _ compared to @xmath16 ( see fig.[figfandg ] ) .",
    "= 4.5 cm    for illustration i consider the problem in one dimension .",
    "then the chain of local power corrections to the perturbative result is obtained from the expression @xmath21 which is the bilinear form in the dual space spanned by strongly peaked functions such as @xmath22 and slowly varying functions such as @xmath23 . the generalization to more than one dimension , which also allows the treatment of non - perturbative @xmath24-point correlators , is straightforward . in the ope @xmath19",
    "is expanded in analogy to the multipole expansion of a localized charge distribution in electrostatics .",
    "this can be formulated by introducing the dual space basis functions ( @xmath25 ) @xmath26 with the orthonormality relation @xmath27 .",
    "the multipole expansion of @xmath19 then reads @xmath28 which leads to @xmath29 the @xmath30 s are the wilson coefficients and the @xmath31 the matrix elements of operators obtained from locally expanding the field content in the correlator @xmath16 for small @xmath18 . in momentum space representation",
    "the wilson coefficients and matrix elements have the generic form @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the fourier transforms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "briefly switching to 4 dimensions , a simple example for the function @xmath16 is the gauge invariant field strength correlator  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 it generates the following chain of vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) involving local operators of increasing dimension @xmath37 in the limit , where @xmath38 , the vev with the lowest dimension , usually called the gluon condensate , dominates , and the contributions of higher dimensional vev s are suppressed by higher powers of @xmath39 .",
    "vev s with odd numbers of covariant derivatives do not contribute due to parity and time - reversal invariance .",
    "perturbatively , one can define the gluon condensate in such a way that its anomalous dimension vanishes to all orders in @xmath40 .",
    "improved convergence properties may be achieved using a multipole expansion of @xmath19 based on functions of width @xmath41 instead of the infinitely narrow @xmath42-functions .",
    "_ this is the basic idea in the construction of the doe_. at this point i would like to note that there exist a number of phenomenological studies where the non - local expression in eq.([mult ] ) has been analyzed directly without any expansion for cases where the ope did not have a good convergence behavior , see e.g.refs.@xcite .",
    "this approach has the feature that it requires a model - dependent ansatz for the correlation function @xmath16 and that the computation of @xmath19 can become cumbersome , particularly at higher loop level .",
    "the doe has been constructed with the aim to provide an alternative formalism to describe non - local effects .",
    "as we will see later the doe simplifies numerical predictions in a given model for @xmath16 .",
    "however , i will also show that the doe allows to extract non - local non - perturbative information on the qcd vacuum in a model - independent way .",
    "let me continue with the construction of the doe",
    ". for cartesian coordinates the dual space basis @xmath43 with @xmath44 , the @xmath45 being the hermite polynomials , is well suited .",
    "of course this choice is not unique , but it fixes a scheme , which can be unambiguously related to other possible schemes that can be used .",
    "the @xmath46 have a width of order @xmath47 , and for @xmath48 one finds @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 is called _",
    "resolution scale_. in this basis eq.([mult ] ) can be written as @xmath52 where the @xmath51-dependent short - distance coefficients and matrix elements have the form @xmath53 in momentum space representation .",
    "the series in eq.([fgdelocalized ] ) has better convergence properties , if @xmath51 is of order @xmath14 rather than being equal to @xmath54 , because the first term in the delocalized multipole expansion generally provides a better approximation of the actual form of @xmath19 than the local expansion .",
    "the relation between basis functions for resolution parameters @xmath51 and @xmath55 reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 if @xmath58 and even , and @xmath59 otherwise .",
    "the transformations @xmath60 form a group .",
    "one can relate the short - distance coefficients and matrix elements for different resolution parameters to each other .",

    "finite _ linear combination of the local wilson coefficients @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "the short - distance coefficient of the leading power correction is @xmath51-independent .",
    "the @xmath51-dependent matrix elements @xmath66 are related to an _",
    "infinite _ sum of local matrix elements with additional covariant derivatives .",
    "these properties exist for all dual space bases constructed from orthogonal polynomials .",
    "note that relations([fgrelationomegainfty ] ) can also be employed if the separation between long- and short - distance contributions is factorization scale dependent , and one can therefore use these relations as the formal definition of the terms in the doe .",
    "the doe of quantities such as in eq.([wilson ] ) has the same parametric counting in powers of @xmath39 as the ope , if @xmath51 is not chosen parametrically smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "consider that @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the ope , then we have @xmath69 as long as @xmath70 .",
    "however , one expects that the actual size of the term @xmath71 in the doe for @xmath72 has an additional numerical suppression by powers of a small number .",
    "in heavy quarkonium systems the relevant physical scales , mass @xmath73 , momentum @xmath74 , energy @xmath75 and @xmath15 have the hierarchy @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the quark velocity .",
    "thus the spatial size @xmath78 is much smaller than the typical dynamical time scale @xmath79 . in this section",
    "i demonstrate the doe in a toy - model computation for the nonperturbative corrections to the @xmath80 ground state for the expansion in @xmath81 .",
    "my intention is not to carry out a phenomenological study , but to show how well the series in the doe behaves in comparison to the series in ope and how well the doe approximates the exact model result",
    ". the ratios of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are treated at leading order in the local expansion .",
    "this means that the perturbative dynamics is described by the nonrelativistic two - body schrdinger equation and that the interaction with the nonperturbative vacuum is accounted for by two insertions of the local @xmath82 dipole operator , @xmath83 being the chromoelectric field.@xcite the chain of vev s of the two gluon operator with increasing numbers of covariant derivatives times powers of quark - antiquark octet propagators  @xcite , is treated in the doe . in this model",
    "the interaction with the vacuum fluctuations only depends on the temporal distance ( in euclidean space ) of two insertions of @xmath82 dipole operators and the nonperturbative correction to the ground state energy reads ( @xmath84 ) @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the short - distance function that depends on ground state coulomb wave function @xmath87 and the octet green - function @xmath88  @xcite and @xmath89 is the gluon field strength correlator for @xmath90 . in fig.[figffunction ] the function @xmath86 ( solid line ) is displayed for @xmath91gev and @xmath92 .",
    "the characteristic width of @xmath22 is of order the energy @xmath93 . for the nonperturbative gluonic field strength correlator",
    "i use a lattice - inspired  @xcite model @xmath94 with a large - time behavior @xmath95 . in this model",

    "the size of the order @xmath24 term is about a factor @xmath106 smaller than the order @xmath24 term in the local expansion .",
    "one also observes that even in the case @xmath107 the leading term in the delocalized expansion for @xmath100 agrees with the exact result within a few percent .",
    "this feature is a general property of the delocalized expansion , and should apply to any quantity for which the local expansion in the ratio of two scales breaks down because the ratio is not sufficiently small .",
    "the @xmath51-dependent matrix elements are either determined from experimental data or from lattice measurements . in the following the @xmath51-dependent ( `` running '' ) gluon condensate",
    "is extracted from charmonium sum rules which are based on moments  @xcite @xmath108 of the correlator of two charm quark vector currents @xmath109 .",

    "we consider the ratio  @xcite @xmath114 and extract the gluon condensate as a function of @xmath24 . since the relevant short - distance scale for the moment @xmath115 is of order @xmath116 , a proper choice for the resolution scale is @xmath117 .",
    "thus the dependence of the gluon condensate on @xmath24 can be interpreted as the dependence on @xmath51 .",

    "@xcite this `` delocalized operator expansion '' ( doe ) depends on an additional parameter @xmath51 , called `` resolution scale '' which adjusts the width of the projection functions used for the expansion .",
    "the doe has the same power counting as the ope , but in general better convergence properties than the ope .",
    "the doe short - distance coefficients can be determined from the ope wilson coefficients at the same order in the expansion , whereas the doe matrix elements correspond to an infinite sum of ope matrix elements with additional covariant derivatives .",
