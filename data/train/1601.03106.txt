    "useful , or 3 .",
    "tentative , roger penrose @xcite clearly places it in the first category . in the context of cosmology , it was the investigation of solutions to einstein s field equations and their comparison with observations that led to the detailed picture of our universe and its evolution that we currently have .",
    "astonishing implications like the existence of dark energy and dark matter , the accelerated expansion and the indication that everything arose out of a big bang are all part of general relativistic cosmological models . moreover , no alternative theory of gravity ( like string theory , loop quantum gravity , brans - dicke theory , etc . )",
    "has yet provided a model of the large - scale universe that makes experimentally testable predictions that are beyond those of general relativity .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is also well - known that not _ all _ mathematical solutions to the einstein equations are physically acceptable .",
    "some cosmological models violate reasonable assumptions that are widely believed to hold in the real universe , like causality and determinism .",
    "a famous example of a solution with such an interesting pathological behaviour is the taub solution @xcite , a 2-parameter family of spatially homogeneous cosmological models .",
    "these maximal globally hyperbolic spacetimes @xcite are perfectly well - behaved in the time interval in which they are initially defined .",
    "however , they can be extended into the future and past to obtain the taub - nut solutions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , there are several non - equivalent extensions @xcite , so that information about the solutions in the original domain does not uniquely determine which of these extensions is realised  determinism breaks down .",
    "moreover , beyond the cauchy horizons ( the hypersurfaces that separate the maximal globally hyperbolic region from the extended regions ) there exist closed causal curves , which would allow observers or photons to travel back in time  clearly a violation of causality .",
    "these unusual properties of the taub - nut solution have led to the question as to whether such a pathological behaviour is a typical feature of solutions to einstein s field equations , or whether it can only occur under very special circumstances , such as for spacetimes with a high degree of symmetry or very restricted types of matter . according to the famous strong cosmic censorship conjecture @xcite ( see also @xcite for more details and further references )",
    ", the maximal globally hyperbolic development of generic data on some cauchy surface is _",
    "inextendible_. if this hypothesis were true , it would imply that solutions which , like the taub solution , can be extended into acausal regions are rare exceptions .",
    "they could only occur for a ( in some sense ) negligibly small set of `` non - generic '' initial data .",
    "unfortunately , in the current state of the art , it seems unrealistic to prove or disprove the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in full generality . instead , a practicable and promising approach is to start from suitable small classes of symmetric models and investigate their properties . then one can try to gradually increase the complexity of the models and explore their behaviour . for each class of models , one can attempt to prove existence of solutions with cauchy horizons and acausal regions , and study properties like the presence of curvature singularities .    along those lines , the existence of a class of vacuum solutions with cauchy horizons ",
    "the _ generalised taub - nut spacetimes _  was shown by moncrief @xcite .",
    "more recently , a different class of cosmological models with cauchy horizons has been introduced : the _ smooth gowdy - symmetric generalised taub - nut ( sggtn ) solutions_. existence of these inhomogeneous cosmological vacuum models was shown in @xcite .",
    "compared to moncrief s class of solutions , the sggtn models require less regularity ( smoothness instead of analyticity ) but more symmetry ( gowdy symmetry with two spacelike killing vectors instead of just one ) .",
    "a number of properties of these solutions can be studied with abstract methods , but in order to get a more complete picture of the behaviour of some of these models , it is desirable to obtain families of exact solutions .",
    "recently , two families of exact sggtn solutions were constructed with methods from soliton theory @xcite .",
    "both families contain cauchy horizons and acausal regions , but their causal and singularity structure is quite different , as will be summarised below .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to construct more general families of exact solutions , again using methods from soliton theory .",
    "the nature of the desired generalizations is twofold : ( i ) we want to embed the two above - mentioned exact solution families into a larger family that contains both as special cases , a family which combines all of the interesting properties that these two families have , and ( ii ) to extend the considerations from vacuum to electrovacuum , in order to include a non - trivial additional field , and to construct an exact solution family for that case too .    to this end",
    ", we will start by summarizing the definition and important properties of the class of sggtn solutions in sec .",
    "[ sec : sggtn ] . in the same section",
    ", we also give an overview of the two exact solution families that we intend to generalize . in sec .",
    "[ sec : vacuum ] we present a new family of vacuum solutions and discuss their properties .",
    "afterwards , in sec .",
    "[ sec : newelectrovac ] , we work out the generalization of the underlying equations to electrovacuum and derive a corresponding family of exact solutions . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss our results .",
    "in this subsection we summarize some properties of the `` smooth gowdy - symmetric generalised taub - nut ( sggtn ) solutions '' . for more details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the sggtn models are solutions to the einstein vacuum equations , their spatial topology is @xmath0  the three - sphere topology  and they have a past and ( generally ) a future cauchy horizon . in terms of a time",
    "coordinate @xmath1 and spatial coordinates @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( which are adapted to the two killing vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , the line element is given by @xmath7.\\ ] ] here @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are functions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 alone , and @xmath11 is a positive constant .",
    "the angles @xmath3 , @xmath4 take on values in the regions @xmath12 and the solutions are initially defined in the `` gowdy square '' with @xmath13 the boundaries @xmath14 of the gowdy square are symmetry axes , and the boundaries @xmath15 correspond to the past and future cauchy horizons @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , the solutions can be extended through these horizons .",
    "we do not list the corresponding einstein vacuum equations here , since they can be obtained from the electrovacuum equations  in appendix  [ sec : em ] in the limit of vanishing 4-potential ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , we note that the essential part of the field equations is equivalent to the ernst equation @xmath19 for the complex ernst potential @xmath20 .",
    "the sggtn solutions have two functional degrees of freedom , namely the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 considered in @xcite ( these are called `` asymptotic data '' and describe the behaviour of the solution as the past cauchy horizon @xmath16 is approached ) , or , equivalently , the initial ernst potential at the past cauchy horizon , @xmath23 . in the original setup in @xcite , the initial data have to be chosen subject to a periodicity condition . this condition ensures that the past horizon is generated by the killing vector @xmath5 , which has _",
    "closed _ orbits . in this situation ,",
    "the metric functions satisfy the following regularity conditions at the axes @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26    in @xcite this was generalised to sggtn spacetimes with past horizons that are ruled by _ non - closed _ null - generators .",
    "investigations of cauchy horizons with this property are particularly interesting as some theorems about cosmological spacetimes assume closedness of the generators @xcite .",
    "hence it is useful to have examples of cosmological models that violate this assumption . in the case of non - closed generators ,",
    "no periodicity condition is required for the asymptotic data , and the past horizon is generated by the null vector @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "also in this more general setup , the metric potentials still have to satisfy the regularity conditions . with an appropriate change of the killing basis (",
    "corresponding to a linear transformation of the coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) it is then possible to arrange that the past horizon is again generated by @xmath5 ( in terms of a new coordinate that we again denote by @xmath3 ) .",
    "this , however , changes the boundary conditions of the transformed metric potentials and the new constant @xmath11 to @xmath29 note that the new coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath4 are no longer defined in the region , but in a different domain ( cf .",
    "@xcite , and see the related discussion in appendix [ sec : axiscoords ] here ) . however , the form of the metric is unchanged . in the following",
    "we will exclusively use these new coordinates and potentials .",
    "note that the solutions are regular in the entire gowdy square , but potentially singular at the future boundary @xmath30 .",
    "this occurs if the imaginary part @xmath31 of the initial ernst potential satisfies the condition @xmath32 where @xmath31 is evaluated at the points @xmath33 in these `` singular cases '' the solutions have a curvature singularity at @xmath30 , @xmath34 ( for a ` @xmath35 ' sign ) or at @xmath30 , @xmath36 ( for a ` @xmath37 ' sign ) . with the condition we can therefore already read off from the initial data at @xmath38 whether or not the solution will develop a singularity at @xmath30 .",
    "finally , we note that the solutions in the extended regions beyond the cauchy horizons can be regular or singular , depending on the particular solution , and we will discuss several examples below .    in the next two subsections we give a short summary of the two exact sggtn solutions that were constructed in @xcite .",
    "an sggtn solution for which the past cauchy horizon has closed null generators , corresponding to @xmath39 in , can be obtained by solving an initial value problem for the ernst equation with appropriate initial data at @xmath38 .",
    "generally , the real part @xmath40 and the imaginary part @xmath31 of the initial ernst potential , considered as functions of @xmath41 have to be chosen subject to the following conditions , which are necessary to guarantee existence of a corresponding regular metric : @xmath42 here , the functions are again evaluated at the above - mentioned points @xmath43 and @xmath44 , cf .  .",
    "consequently , a solution with @xmath39 is obtained by choosing @xmath40 such that @xmath45 .",
    "an initial ernst potential subject to these conditions was studied in @xcite , namely @xmath46,\\ ] ] where the real part is quadratic and the imaginary part cubic in @xmath47 . for the derivation of the corresponding solution we refer to @xcite .",
    "the final results are the metric potentials in terms of @xmath47 and @xmath48 which are given by the following expressions , @xmath49 where @xmath50.\\ ] ] this family of solutions depends on the three parameters @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "in the special case @xmath54 , the solution reduces to the spatially homogeneous taub solution , and for @xmath55 we obtain more complicated inhomogeneous solutions .    according to the singularity condition",
    ", we expect singularities for @xmath56 , but otherwise the solutions are regular in the gowdy square and at the boundaries .",
    "this can be readily verified from the explicit solution .",
    "indeed , for @xmath57 , the kretschmann scalar @xmath58 diverges at the singular point .",
    "interestingly , this divergence is of a directional nature : as the singularity at @xmath30 , @xmath34 or @xmath30 , @xmath36 is approached , @xmath59 either tends to @xmath60 , or to @xmath61 , or even to any finite value , depending on the path along which the singular point is approached .",
    "this is similar to the behaviour of the curzon solution @xcite , as was discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , whereas the curzon solution allows for extensions through its so - called _ directional singularity _",
    "@xcite , the same is not possible for `` solution 1 '' .",
    "this follows from the observation that along each curve towards the singularity on which @xmath59 remains finite , other curvature invariants diverge .",
    "hence the spacetime geometry is still singular along the paths with regular @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , `` solution 1 '' is an interesting example of a solution where the kretschmann scalar alone does not contain the complete information about the singularity structure of the spacetime .",
    "extensions of the solution through the cauchy horizons @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be constructed by reexpressing the line element in terms of the coordinates @xmath47 and @xmath62 instead of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( and after an additional transformation of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "the solution is initially defined in the gowdy square , corresponding to @xmath63 , but it can be extended to all @xmath64 .",
    "it turns out that there are several possible extensions , and they all contain curvature singularities ( one singularity in the past extensions , and either one or two singularities in the future extensions , depending on the parameter values ) .",
    "finally , we note that `` solution 1 '' was recently reproduced numerically , in order to test the numerical accuracy of a new evolution code for cosmological spacetimes with spatial @xmath0 topology and @xmath65 symmetry @xcite .",
    "an sggtn solution with @xmath66 was derived in @xcite .",
    "this was obtained from the initial data @xmath67 which has a cubic real part and a quadratic imaginary part .",
    "the corresponding solution reads @xmath68 ^ 2+\\big[4c_1 d(1+y ) r_d\\big]^2},\\\\    q & = & x+\\frac12(d - r_d - xy),\\\\    { \\mathrm{e}}^m & = &        \\frac{dr_0}{16 c_1(1-d^2)^2r_d}\\left[4d^2(r_d + x - dy)^2 \\right.\\\\        & & \\quad\\left .",

    "for this solution we have @xmath73 for all parameter values .",
    "hence the singularity condition is never satisfied and the spacetime is always regular in the gowdy square .    also for this solution one can introduce suitable coordinates in which extensions through the cauchy horizons can be constructed .",
    "it turns out that the resulting causal structure is more complex than the causal structure of `` solution 1 '' .",
    "in particular , there are further horizons in the extended regions through which the solution can be extended too .",
    "for details we refer to @xcite or to sec .",
    "[ sec : ext ] below , where our new and more general solution is discussed , and turns out to have the same causal structure as this solution .",
    "( the explicit form of the coordinate transformations for the solution below is just slightly more complicated than the transformations needed for `` solution 2 '' here . )    finally , it turns out that the solution is everywhere free of singularities  not only in the gowdy square , but also in all extensions .",
    "in the following we intend to find a more general 4-parameter family of solutions that contains the 3-parameter solutions 1 and 2 described above as special cases .      we intend to solve the ernst equation for the initial ernst potential @xmath74.\\ ] ] here both the real and imaginary parts of @xmath75 are cubic functions of @xmath47 .",

    "we find @xmath78 so that the condition @xmath79 [ cf .",

    "@xmath71 turns out to be completely fixed in terms of the parameter @xmath72 , which was introduced in . to this end",

    ", we use the integral equation method due to sibgatullin @xcite .",
    "since this procedure has been described in detail in @xcite , we only give a short summary here .",

    "nevertheless , with the formal , complex coordinate transformation @xmath90 to coordinates ( @xmath91 ) , our metric takes the weyl - lewis - papapetrou form for axisymmetric and stationary spacetimes .",
    "hence we have translated our initial value problem into a problem that can be tackled with sibgatullin s method .",
    "the idea of this method is the following .",
    "for a given initial ernst potential at @xmath38 ( corresponding to @xmath92 ) , we consider the analytic continuation @xmath93 , @xmath94 with @xmath95",

    "once the integral equation is solved , the corresponding ernst potential can be obtained from another integration , @xmath108 from @xmath75 we can construct the metric potentials @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 with a combination of algebraic manipulations and line integrations ( or , equivalently , by solving first - order pdes ) , see @xcite for details .",
    "this computation is somewhat involved and we found that only with an appropriate combination of maple and mathematica all required integrals could be computed ..",
    "after @xmath8 and @xmath9 are available , one finds explicit expressions for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the attempt to integrate @xmath109 with respect to @xmath47 in mathematica , in the special case @xmath54 ( i.e.  the case of `` solution 2 '' ) leads to a complicated expression that involves the sum over roots of a fourth - order polynomial . with maple",
