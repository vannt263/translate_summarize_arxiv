    ", there have been a lot of studies in the insurance and finance literature on the so - called dual risk model , see e.g. @xcite , with wealth process following the dynamics : @xmath9 where @xmath1 is the cost of running the company and @xmath2 , is the stream of profits , where @xmath5 are i.i.d . @xmath10",

    "the dual risk model is used to model the wealth of a venture capital , whose profits depend on the research and development .",
    "the classical risk model is most often interpreted as the surplus of an insurance company . on the other hand ,",
    "the dual risk model can be understood as the wealth of a venture capital or high tech company .",
    "the analogue of the premium in the classical model is the running cost in the dual model , and the claims become the future profits of the company .",
    "one of the most fundamental question in the dual risk model is the optimal dividend strategies .",
    "avanzi et al .",
    "@xcite worked on optimal dividends in the dual risk model where the optimal strategy is a barrier strategy .",
    "avanzi et al .",
    "@xcite studied a dividend barrier strategy for the dual risk model whereby dividend decisions are made only periodically , but still allow ruin to occur at any time . a dual model with a threshold dividend strategy , with exponential interclaim times",
    "was studied in ng @xcite .",
    "afonso et al .",
    "@xcite also worked on dividend problem in the dual risk model , assuming exponential interclaim times .",
    "a new approach for the calculation of expected discounted dividends was presented and ruin and dividend probabilities , number of dividends , time to a dividend , and the distribution for the amount of single dividends were studied .",
    "dividend moments in the dual risk model were considered in cheung and drekic @xcite .",
    "they derived integro - differential equations for the moments of the total discounted dividends which can be solved explicitly assuming the jump size distribution has a rational laplace transform .",

    "the laplace transform of the ruin time , expected discounted dividends for the sparre - andersen dual model were derived in yang and sendova @xcite .",
    "so far the optimization problems studied in the literature on dual risk models are almost exclusively devoted to the optimal dividend strategy . in this paper",
    ", we consider a different type of optimization problem . for",
    "a venture capital , or a high tech company , the investment strategy on research and development ( r&d ) is crucial .",
    "a decision to increase the investment on research and development will increase the running cost of the company , but that will also boost the possibility of the future profits . therefore , we believe that it is of fundamental interest to understand the optimal investment strategy to strengthen the position of the company .",
    "it is well known that research and development is a basic engine of economic and social growth .",
    "it is a considerable amount of spending among many leading corporations in the world .",
    "a 2014 fortune article listed the top ten biggest r&d spenders worldwide in the year 2013 , including volkswagen , samsung , intel , microsoft , roche , novartis , toyota , johnson & johnson , google and merck , with intel spent as much as 20.1% of their revenue on r&d , see @xcite .",
    "many technology giants increase their r&d spending consistently , year over year , see e.g. table [ google ] for the r&d and percentage of the revenues of google in the years 2011 - 2014 . notice that in the case of google , even though the r&d expenditure increases year by year , it increases in line with the increase of the total revenues so that as the percentage of revenues , the number does not change much . for some companies , both the absolute r&d expenditure amount and the percentage",
    "as the revenues remain reasonably stable , see e.g. table [ merck ] for merck in the years 2011 - 2014 . for some companies , both the absolute r&d expenditure amount and the percentage",
    "as the revenues can change dramatically , see e.g. table [ tesla ] for tesla in the years 2011 - 2014 .",
    "the case of tesla is exceptional but not unusual for a new high - tech company in the sense the in the fiscal year 2011 , the r&d expenditure exceeded the total revenues .",
    "another company that has enjoyed similar phenomenal growth as tesla is the facebook , see table [ facebook ] . but facebook s spending on r&d is not as aggressive as tesla .    since it is expensed rather than capitalized , cuts on research and development increases in profit in the short term , but it can hurt the strength of a company in the long run , even if the detrimental impact of the cuts may not be felt for a few years . in the most recent recession ,",
    "firms with revenues greater than 100 million usd reduced their research and development intensity ( divided by revenue ) by 5.6% , even though the advertising intensity actually increased 3.4% , see @xcite . in the long run , the research and development does help the company grow and",
    "increase the value of a company . using a measure of the so - called research quotient , a study over all",
    "publicly traded us companies from 1981 through 2006 suggested that a 10% increase in research quotient , results an increase in market value of 1.1% , see @xcite .",
    "indeed , the us government also encourages the research and development activities .",
    "the research & experimentation tax credit , is a general business tax credit passed by the congress in 1981 , as a response to the concerns that research spending declines had adversely affected the country s economic growth , productivity gains , and competitiveness within the global marketplace . according to a study by ernst & young , in the year 2005 ,",

    "there are only a limited number of works on the optimal venture capital investments , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in addition to the investment in research and development , we will also allow the investment in a risky asset , e.g. a market index .",
    "the possibility that an insurer can invest part of the surplus into a risky asset to minimize the ruin probability has been studied by browne @xcite for the case that the insurance business is modelled by a brownian motion with constant drift and the risky asset is modelled as a geometric brownian motion .",

    ", they studied the minimization of the ruin probability for the classical risk model with possible investment in a risky asset that follows a geometric brownian motion under the borrowing constraints .",
    "there have been many other works in this area . for a survey",
    ", we refer to paulsen @xcite and the references therein .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first study the optimal investment strategy on research and development to minimize the ruin probability of the company .",
    "then , we generalize our results to a state - dependent dual risk model that was first introduced in zhu @xcite .",
    "when the size of a company increases , the cost usually also increases , while the resource of income will also increase in general , which makes it natural to study a state - dependent dual risk model .",
    "next , we will study and optimal investment strategy so that in addition to the investment in the research and development , the investment in a risky asset , e.g. a capital market index is allowed .",
    "finally , we will do some numerical studies to understand better how the minimized ruin probability and the optimal strategy depend on the parameters in the model .",
    "the management of the underlying company can decide whether or not to increase the capital spending on research and development to boost the future profits .",
    "our goal is to find the optimal expenditure on research and development to minimize the probability that the company is eventually ruined .",
    "let @xmath13 be the ruin time .",
    "the eventual ruin probability is defined as a function of the initial wealth @xmath14 : @xmath15 .    note that under the assumption @xmath16>\\rho$ ]",

    "what it says is that the initial investment of research and development can boost the prospect of future profits , but the margin decreases as the increase of the investment .",
    "we are interested to study the following stochastic optimal control problem : @xmath51 where @xmath23 is the set of all non - negative @xmath52 measurable functions @xmath50 that satisfies @xmath53 .    we know that if we choose @xmath54 , @xmath55 under the condition @xmath16>\\rho$ ] and thus @xmath56 .",
    "notice that our assumptions that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are constant might be too simplified to model the running costs and profits of a real company , especially when the underlying company is a relatively new high tech company for which the revenues and r&d expenditure can change a lot over time , see e.g. table [ google ] , table [ tesla ] .",
    "but for a more mature company , the revenues and r&d are usually more stable , see e.g. table [ merck ] .",

    "we noticed that in the state - independent case , the optimal strategy is always a constant , and independent of the state .",
    "we expect that the optimal strategy might be state - dependent when the underlying dual risk model is state - dependent .",
