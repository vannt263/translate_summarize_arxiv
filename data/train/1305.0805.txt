    "secret sharing is a cryptographic protocol in which a dealer distributes a shared secret among a set of players , so that only certain authorized subsets can collaboratively recover the secret .",
    "the protocol , first introduced by shamir @xcite and blakley @xcite , is important in any area that requires sharing of highly sensitive information , such as bank accounts , missile launch sequences etc .",
    "the quantum counterpart is a scheme in which the dealer distributes either a classical secret @xcite ( string of bits ) or a quantum secret ( quantum state ) @xcite to the set of players via quantum channels @xcite .",
    "quantum secret - sharing is useful for distributing shared quantum keys , non - counterfeitable  quantum money \" @xcite , distributed quantum computing @xcite , secure quantum memory and multipartite quantum communication @xcite . for the quantum secret - sharing protocol to be feasible , the dealer is assumed to be  powerful \"  she can prepare arbitrary quantum states and reliably distribute them to the players .",
    "the players have full access to universal quantum computers and can communicate among themselves via quantum channels so that only certain authorized subsets can recover ( decode ) the secret .",
    "the decoding operation is harder to implement than in the classical case , as it requires quantum communication which is expensive .    reducing the amount of quantum communication required for the decoding can improve the efficiency of distributed cryptographic protocols in which a subset of the players have restricted communication capabilities .",
    "consider for example a quantum secret - sharing scheme with players divided into two subsets , one of which is computationally powerful ( each player has access to universal quantum computation and all players can use quantum communication ) , whereas the other one is computationally weak ( each player has access to local universal quantum computers but the players can use only classical communication between them ) .",
    "one such instance is a secret - sharing scheme between earth ( the computationally powerful subset ) and , for example , the international space station ( the computationally weak subset ) .    reducing the amount of quantum communication ( i.e. reducing the number of non - local operations involved ) also helps simplify the decoding of quantum error - correcting codes @xcite , which are of crucial importance for the construction of a real - world fault - tolerant quantum computer .    in this article",
    "we solve the following problem . for a large class of quantum secret - sharing schemes constructed from classical linear error - correcting codes @xcite ,",
    "we show that their decoding can be simplified by replacing some of the quantum channels among the players by classical ones .",
    "inspired by the calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) construction @xcite we embed a classical linear error - correcting code into a quantum code and then show that this embedding induces a quantum secret - sharing scheme in which all players have to collaborate to recover the secret . in this protocol",
    "some of the players are only required to perform local measurements and share their measurement results via classical channels .",
    "we begin by considering an @xmath0_q$ ] classical error - correcting code over @xmath1 , the galois field with elements , where @xmath2 is prime and @xmath3 is a positive integer .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 denotes the number of encoded _ dits _ ( generalization of a bit that allows holding more than 2 states ) , @xmath5 is the number of carriers and @xmath6 is the distance of the code .",
    "we can represent such a code compactly using a @xmath7 _ generator matrix _",
    "@xmath8 with elements in @xmath1 .",
    "each codeword ( @xmath5-tuple in @xmath9 to denote a column vector . ] ) can then be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a @xmath4-tuple in @xmath12 , for a total number of codewords equal to @xmath13 , where the addition and multiplication in are over the finite field @xmath1 .",
    "one can regard @xmath8 as a linear mapping from the  input \" space @xmath12 to the  output \" ( or encoded ) subspace of @xmath9 , see the top of our diagram ( mapping 1 ) in fig .",
    "[ fgr1 ] .",
    "we use the elements @xmath14 to label the basis vectors of @xmath15 , the hilbert space of @xmath4 qudits , and denote the collection of the orthonormal basis vectors by @xmath16 ( see the mapping 4 in fig .  [ fgr1 ] ) .",
    "similarly we embed the elements @xmath17 into a subspace of the @xmath18 spanned by the collection of orthonormal vectors @xmath19 , as depicted by mapping 2 in fig .",

    "a dealer holds a @xmath4-qudit quantum secret @xmath21 with @xmath22 normalized complex coefficients .",
    "the secret is then distributed to a set of @xmath5 players using the isometric encoding @xmath20 , so the state shared by the players is @xmath23      we next design a decoding protocol in which all @xmath5 players have to collaborate ; however , just a proper subset @xmath24 of the entire set of players @xmath25 is required to use local operations and classical communication ( locc ) with the complementary subset @xmath26 . the latter subset can then fully recover the quantum secret .",
