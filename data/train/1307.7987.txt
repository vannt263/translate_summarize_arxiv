    "in semiconductors irradiated by a strong terahertz ( thz ) laser of frequency @xmath2 , the electron - hole pairs excited by a weak optical laser of frequency @xmath3 are driven into large amplitude oscillations .",
    "they subsequently acquire kinetic energies much greater than the thz photon energy during the oscillations , which leads to optical emission at frequencies @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is an integer .",
    "@xcite this high - order thz - sideband generation ( hsg ) in semiconductors is a generalization of the high - order harmonic generation ( hhg )  @xcite to the thz frequency regime .",
    "the sidebands in the frequency domain indicate thz modulation in the time domain , which has potential applications in tbit / s optical communications , trillion - fps optical imaging and wideband optical multiplexers .",
    "the core physics of hhg and hsg is captured by the quantum trajectory theory .",
    "@xcite when the electrons ( or electron - hole pairs ) are driven by the strong laser field , their oscillation amplitudes are much larger than the wavepacket diffusion range .",
    "therefore the quantum evolution of the electrons ( or electron - hole pairs ) is well described by quantum trajectories that satisfy the stationary phase condition ( i.e. , the least action condition in classical mechanics ) in the formalism of dirac - feynmann path integrals .",
    "@xcite    a fundamental difference between hhg and hsg is that the electron - hole pair in semiconductors can have nontrivial bloch states .",
    "@xcite as a result , when the eletron ( or hole ) is driven by the thz field @xmath6 in the conduction ( or valence ) bands , not only does the quasi - momentum change according to @xmath7 ,  @xcite but also does its bloch wavefunction evolve with @xmath8 .",
    "since the thz frequency is much smaller than the band gaps of semiconductors , the evolution is adiabatic ( i.e. , no interband tunneling is induced by the thz field ) .",
    "this adiabatic evolution along the quantum trajectory in semiconductors can accumulate a geometrical phase , in particular a berry phase for a cyclic evolution .",
    "@xcite a rich structures of the bloch states in condensed matter systems ( such as in topological insulators  @xcite ) thus leads to a variety of phase effects in extreme nonlinear optics .",
    "an additional important difference between the hhg and hsg physics is that the electron - hole pairs are elementary optical excitations in solids .",
    "therefore , the quantum trajectories in semiconductors , unlike those in atoms , can be triggered by lasers on demand at designed frequencies  @xcite or times ( relative to the thz field oscillation ) .",
    "this excitation at will provides a great deal of controllability and flexibility for studying the quantum trajectories in extreme nonlinear optics .    in ref .",
    ", the berry phase dependent quantum trajectory theory was applied to monolayer mos@xmath0 with a band gap in the visible wavelength regime .",
    "the optical emission delayed by integer multiples of the thz period after the pulse excitation acquires a faraday rotation .",
    "the rotation angle was shown to be exactly the berry phase of the quantum trajectory ( @xmath1 0.01 rad for a thz field with frequency 1 thz and strength 8 kv / cm ) .",
    "that result provides new opportunities to utilize thz extreme nonlinear optics of thin film materials for ultrafast electro - optical devices .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the transient optical response of bernal stacked bilayer graphene excited by a weak optical pulse and a strong thz field .",
    "the bilayer graphene with an interlayer gate bias  @xcite has similar bloch band features and optical properties as the monolayer mos@xmath0 but with a smaller band gap tunable up to @xmath9 mev .",
    "its conduction and valence - band edges are located at the corners of the 2d hexagonal brillouin zone , and similar to mos@xmath0 , the optical interband transitions at the two time - reversal ( tr ) related valleys have nearly perfect but opposite polarization selection rules .",
    "@xcite these features make bilayer graphene an excellent candidate for the observation of the berry phases of quantum trajectories . in bilayer",
    "graphene without interlayer bias , the conduction ( valence ) state acquires a @xmath10 berry phase ( pseudospin winding number being @xmath11 ) along any closed path around the dirac points ,  @xcite and the berry curvature is completely concentrated on the singular monopole at the dirac point . in biased bilayer graphene that has an energy gap opened at the dirac points ,",
    "the berry curvature becomes non - singular while its distribution is still concentrated in a small region in the vicinity of the dirac points ( since the berry curvature of the region far from the dirac point is zero as in the unbiased case ) ( see fig .",
    "[ optical_sel ] ) .",
    "thus the berry curvature in bilayer graphene is much ( about 100 times ) larger than in monolayer mos@xmath0 .",
    "this leads to a much larger berry phase of a quantum trajectory and in turn giant faraday rotation .",
    "in other words , bilayer graphene requires a much weaker thz laser to induce an observable faraday rotation , and serves as a better material for ultrafast electro - optical devices than mos@xmath0 . besides , the band gap at the dirac points is tunable by an applied gate bias between zero and midinfrared energies ,  @xcite which offers outstanding controllability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ genernal ] , we present a general theory of optical response in semiconductors under a strong thz field , with the berry phase effects included .",
    "the optical response under a pulsed optical excitation is studied using the quantum trajectory theory . in materials with both tr symmetry and optical selection rules , the faraday rotation angle of the optical emission delayed by multiples of the thz period",
    "is shown to be exactly equal to the berry phase of the stationary quantum trajectory . in sec .",
    "[ main ] , we show the valley contrasted optical selection rules of the biased bilayer graphene , which makes it a good system for the observation of the berry phases of quantum trajectories . furthermore , calculation shows that the bilayer graphene has a berry curvature much lager than that in monolayer mos@xmath0 , which leads to a much larger berry phase of the stationary trajectory and in turn much larger faraday rotation .",

    ". then we study the interaction of this system with a weak optical laser that creates electron - hole pairs at the band edge .",

    "we assume that the initial state is the vacuum state @xmath33 with empty conduction bands and filled valence bands .",
    "after excitation by an optical laser , the electron ( hole ) is driven into adiabatic evolution in the conduction ( valence ) band by the thz field , and thus obtains a geometric phase @xmath34 in addition to the dynamical phase @xmath35 , where @xmath36 are the berry connections with @xmath37 being the instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath38 with instantaneous eigenenergies @xmath39 .",
    "in general , the berry connection can be non - abelian ( i.e. @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) and the geometric phase factor becomes a unitary matrix @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the time - ordering operator .",
    "the electron and hole recombine at a later time , leading to optical emission modified by the geometric phase .",
    "the linear optical response of thz field driven semiconductors has been formulated in ref . .",

    "after an integer multiple of the thz period @xmath54 , the electron ( hole ) undergoes a cyclic evolution in the conduction ( valence ) band and the geometric phase becomes the gauge invariant berry phase .",
    "@xcite using equation ( [ trrelation ] ) , we get @xmath55 i.e. the two tr related states have opposite berry phases",
    ". then the response at @xmath56 is simplified as @xmath57 we see that @xmath58 is given by the interference between two responses with the same dynamical phase but opposite berry phases , which , as shown below , results in a faraday rotation of the optical emission .    the main consequence of equation  ( [ respn ] )",
    "can be understood using the stationary phase formalism ( or the quantum trajectory theory ) .",

    ", the motion amplitude of the electron - hole pair is much larger than the wavepacket diffusion range .",

    "( [ saddle ] ) means the electron under the acceleration by the thz field returns to the hole after @xmath62 for recombination .",

    "the berry phase @xmath66 is accumulated along the stationary trajectory .",
    "when multiple solutions exist , the response is given by the interference of all possible stationary trajectories .",
    "the optical selection rule near the dirac points in bilayer graphene is such that the interband dipole moment @xmath67 , i.e. the optical transitions at valley @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is coupled to the @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) polarized light ( see sec .",
