    "we derive the sab model considering a scalar problem , @xmath7 .    whereas the initial branched system has no volume ( 1d description ) , it is necessary to introduce its finite volume for averaging purposes ( see fig .  [",

    "to obtain space - averaged quantities , we introduce a representative volume @xmath8 and denote @xmath9 the volume occupied by the branched system included in @xmath8 , as sketched in fig .",

    "the model equations , eqs .   and , are then solved using an implicit euler method on each characteristic curve @xmath50 .",
    "we compute the loads induced by a uniform cross flow on an idealized tree , using the present space - averaged branching model and finite elements computations .",
    "note that the loads are proportional to the fluid dynamic pressure @xmath108 , hence one only needs to compute the loads for a single fluid velocity @xmath109 .",

    "note that there is no fitting parameter in this model .",
    "the discontinuities visible in the fem  curves are due to the branching points , and are naturally smoothed by the sab model",
    ". these discontinuities are even more significant for the bending stress , as it depends strongly on the branch diameter . for this mechanical quantity , the choice of eq",
    ".   has an important influence on the value computed by the sab model . with the simple choice made here ,",
    "we observe a good agreement , allowing us to recover the right order of magnitude and stress profile , with a local maximum near the top , i.e.  in the tree crown .",
    "the space - averaged branching model provides a good estimate of the flow - induced loads , removing the discontinuities introduced by the branching points , without any fitting parameter .",
    "moreover , the computations on a random tree - like structures show that there is no particular symmetry required in the initial system .",
    "the present model was derived under the assumption of eq .  , implying in particular that the branching angle should be small . whereas this was the case in the example of mass conservation in a 1d pipe system ,",
    "the branching angle is not negligible in the geometries considered in this section .",
    "we see therefore that the assumption of eq .",
    "is not very restrictive , and the sab model remains valid for various realistic systems .",
    "we apply now this model to the example of flow - induced pruning in idealized trees submitted to wind @xcite .",
    "flow - induced pruning refers to the pruning of branches ( or more generally parts of the structure ) by the external flow , as the velocity increases , thereby reducing the drag experienced by the tree . in this section ,",
    "we focus on flow - induced pruning in the absence of deformations .",
    "the pruning procedure is that described in @xcite : when the velocity increases , breakage occurs where and when the bending stress reaches the yield stress @xmath117 .",
    "the broken branch is then removed , and the computation continues on the remaining structure . for the sab model ,",
    "the same procedure is applied on each characteristic curve .",
    "the fluid velocity is further increased until a new breaking event occurs .",
    "the sab model is not adapted for computing the loads in a single branch , in particular in the tree trunk . in the following",
    ", flow - induced pruning is studied only in the tree crown , and compared with the finite elements computations by looking at the evolution of the total drag at the base of the crown . in the sab computations ,",
    "this drag is the average value over the characteristic curves at the base of the tree crown .",
    "finally , in the finite element analysis , the computation stops when the structure is entirely broken .",
    "this corresponds in fact to the first breaking event located at the base of the structure .",
    "we choose similarly to stop the sab computations when 1% of the characteristic curves are broken at their base .",
    "this problem is now a global problem involving the entire domain , and raises the issue of convergence with respect to the number of characteristic curves .",
    "we address this issue by comparing four quantities for different numbers of characteristic curves @xmath58 to their value for @xmath118 .",
    "those quantities are the flow velocities at the first and last breaking events ( @xmath119 , @xmath120 ) and the corresponding drag ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 ) .",

    "[ fig:9 ] that these quantities vary dramatically at low numbers of characteristic curves , but converge for @xmath123 .",

    "symbols correspond to velocities at first and last breaking events ( @xmath125 , @xmath126 ) and corresponding drag ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) , normalized by their value for @xmath118 . ]",
    "we turn now to the drag evolution as the flow velocity increases . since it was observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] that the stress is underestimated in the sab model , we apply a numerical correction to the yield stress ( @xmath129 ) for comparison purpose , so that the first breaking event occurs at the same flow velocity . the evolution of the drag is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] , for @xmath130 in the sab model .",
    "we observe a very good agreement between sab and fem on the drag evolution under increasing flow velocity .",
    "the sab model reproduces accurately the process of flow - induced pruning in a tree : the first drag reduction is well captured , as well as the subsequent slow increase . in this figure ,",
    "sudden drops of the drag correspond to breaking events .",
    "the geometries corresponding to @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( in arbitrary units ) show similar broken regions and thus good qualitative agreement .",

    "interested in modeling conservation laws in ramified system in a continuous way , we developed in this work an original model for branched systems using space averaging , named space - averaged branching ( sab ) . using standard averaging methods on branched systems described by one - dimensional equations",
    ", we were able to derive a continuous formulation of conservation laws .",
    "we then used a first order approximation , reducing the model equations to a set of one - dimensional equations along characteristic curves @xmath50 , defined as streamlines of the space - averaged branch direction vector field @xmath44 .",
    "the sab equivalent medium therefore is described by a set of characteristic curves , with one - dimensional balance equations identical to the initial ones , except for an additional term that contains the local information on the geometry .",
    "the derivation of this formulation only requires that the initial problem has a one - dimensional description along the segments of the system . the resulting medium is not ramified , allowing for much simpler and faster computations .",
    "the fields needed in the sab model are essentially the average branch direction , and the volume fraction occupied by the branched system .",
    "the additional term , @xmath134 , referred to as geometrical forcing , is the key element of the sab model , as it accounts for the different geometrical features of the initial structure , including branching , which was the fundamental issue in the initial problem .",
    "this term , defined everywhere continuously , accounts for the discrete aspect of the real system , where each segment has to be treated separately with boundary conditions given by branching point relations .",
    "the sab model therefore provides a continuous and uniform description in the volume occupied by the system .",
    "we validated the space - averaged branching model by considering two different problems .",
    "the first one was a 1d pipe system , easily solved analytically .",
    "the sab model was used to compute the flow rate along the system , and showed excellent agreement with the analytical solution .",
    "the problem , presented in the absence of external forcing , put a particular emphasis on the crucial role played by the geometrical forcing .",
    "the second problem considered for validation was the computation of mechanical loads induced by a static uniform wind on an idealized tree .",
    "the results were compared to finite elements computations , showing again a very good accuracy of the sab model on the load distribution .",
    "we then considered the sequence of flow - induced pruning , that is the successive breakage of branches under an increasing wind velocity .",
    "the results , consistent with finite elements predictions , showed a fast convergence of the sab computations in terms of number of characteristic curves . in particular , the convergence was found for a number of curves lower than 10% of the maximum number of parallel branches in the tree .    the model was derived considering a first order approximation on fluctuations compared to volume - averaged values . in particular",
    ", we showed that the ramification angle should be small .",
    "however , the example of wind - induced loads on trees showed that the necessary assumption is not very constraining .",
    "in fact , when the branching angle is reduced to 0 ( not shown here for the sake of brevity ) , the maximum bending stress in the structure matches the finite elements prediction .",
    "the stress underestimation in the case @xmath135 can be explained by the large branching angle .",
    "this may not be the only reason , the choice made for computing the bending stress is in fact critical in this case due to the diameter dependence . despite this underestimation of the stress ,",
    "the sab model predicted accurately the load profiles and consistent values without any fitting parameter .",
    "moreover , considering a random tree , it was shown that there is no particular symmetry required in the real system .",
    "the model was validated considering particular geometries where any branching point is characterized by one incoming and several outgoing segments .",
    "in fact , the model was derived in the general case , and could be used for more complicated networks .",
    "for example , the sab model could be applied to blood circulation , where entangled networks of capillaries are more easily described as a continuous medium . moreover ,",
    "the model was derived in the general case , and complex three - dimensional structures and systems could be modeled in a similar manner .",
    "the pipe example has natural applications , for sediment or pollutant transport , in rivers or artificial pipe networks . for the problem of wind - induced loads on a tree",
    ", we presented here the case of a uniform cross flow , but this model can be used in a broader scope .",
    "the coupling of this model with a standard flow model should give additional insights on the interaction between a flow and vegetation .",
    "models used for predicting wind damage to forests could be coupled with this homogeneous description , allowing the possibility of describing the type of damage that would occur in a forest during a storm .",
    "so far , continuous forest models do not account for branching in trees , and consider either homogeneous media or arrays of cylinders as forest models @xcite . as the presented case was derived under a uniform flow",
    ", we did not need to change the sab fields , and could treat each characteristic curve independently .",
    "however , if flow modifications were to be significant , an actualization of these fields would become necessary .",
    "the space - averaged branching model developed in this paper can be used for describing a large variety of branched systems .",
    "the same methodology can be applied for obtaining continuous formulations of conservation laws in complex oriented networks , like internal flows in a pipe network , or in fact the transport of any quantity through a branched network .",
    "introducing the finite volume of the system yields some technical issues at branching regions and at the borders of the averaging volume .",
    "we present here how these issues are overcome .",
    "a first singularity appears at the branching points , concerning the definition of the continuous quantity @xmath136 , fig .",
    "[ fig:11]a . in order to overcome that singularity ,",
    "the branching point is extended to a region whose typical length scale is the diameter of the segments @xmath103 . over this region",
    "the branching relations are conserved between @xmath137 and @xmath138 ( see fig .  [ fig:11]a ) .",
    "the function @xmath16 is therefore unknown in the branching region .",
    "however , this region has a volume that scales as @xmath139 , and @xmath140 ( the segment length ) , due to the branch slenderness .",
    "the length scale of @xmath8 being at least of the order of @xmath141 , the volume represented by the branching regions is negligible compared to the solid volume @xmath9 and the total volume @xmath8 .",
    "a second issue is related to the intersection with the boundaries of the averaging volume .",
    "considering that the branches have a non - zero volume is consistent only if any intersection with the border @xmath142 occurs in the plane normal to the tangent vector @xmath0 , otherwise , @xmath16 can take different values at the intersection .",
    "this is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig:11]b , which shows this artefact of the three - dimensionalisation occurring at the borders @xmath143 of the averaging volume .",
    "this issue is bypassed considering a modified border , shown in solid line in the sketch of fig .",
    "[ fig:11]b . the modification in volume that this adaptability will add is again negligible compared to the total volume @xmath8 , since it scales as @xmath144 .",
