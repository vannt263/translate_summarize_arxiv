    "the counts , spatial clustering and bulk properties of the most massive halos in the universe offer a means to test cosmological physics @xcite .",
    "although only a handful of high redshift ( @xmath18 ) clusters are currently known , the number will grow considerably in the next five years , as a result of improved search techniques using multi - band optical @xcite combined with infrared @xcite or  @xcite imaging .",
    "sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) surveys , based on interferometric @xcite , or bolometric @xcite approaches , will ultimately extend the reach of the cluster population to @xmath19 .",
    "since observational surveys do not select directly on halo mass , interpreting the data requires a model that relates observable bulk features , such as temperature , sunyaev - zeldovich decrement , or  luminosity , to mass .",
    "given sufficiently rich cluster samples , one can solve for parameters describing the mass - observable relation along with cosmological parameters in a simultaneous fashion @xcite .",
    "power - law relationships between bulk properties are expected on dimensional grounds @xcite , but the scatter about mean mass - observable relationships , a crucial element of self - calibration exercises @xcite , is presently poorly understood .    in this paper , we use counts and scaling relations of low redshift clusters in the hiflugcs survey @xcite to investigate the statistical relationship between  luminosity and total halo mass .",
    "the method relies on numerical simulations for calibration of the space density of massive halos @xcite and for an estimate of the covariance of temperature and luminosity at fixed mass .    for a set of structurally identical ,",
    "spherical halos with mass @xmath20 , radius @xmath21 ( here @xmath22 is a threshold defining the halo edge relative to the critical density ) and with intracluster gas fraction @xmath23 , one expects the bolometric luminosity to scale as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a constant , @xmath26 is the critical density , and @xmath27 is a structure function that is sensitive to the second moment of the normalized gas density profile @xmath28    if the ensemble average gas fraction or radial structure function vary with mass and epoch , then the power law exponents will generally differ from the basic expectation .",
    "this is the case for a preheated icm , with @xmath29 , invoked by @xcite to reproduce the x - ray luminosity function in an @xmath30 cold dark matter cosmology .",
    "observations of the @xmath31 relation find a steeper slope , @xmath32 , than expected from self - similarity @xcite .",
    "models incorporating angular momentum in halos have been able to reproduce the steeper relations @xcite .    in general , deviations from spherical symmetry and differences in formation history and dynamical state will produce variations in @xmath33 and @xmath34 among halos of fixed mass , leading naturally to some distribution @xmath35 of soft band luminosity @xmath36 .",
    "we employ here a log - normal conditional likelihood , with fixed dispersion @xmath37 , centered on a power - law scaling relation @xmath38 it is important to note that this equation characterizes the log mean behavior of a mass - limited population .",
    "surveys that are incomplete in mass may differ from this .    for a given choice of model parameters , cluster counts in flux and redshift are generated by convolving @xmath35 with the halo mass function of @xcite and applying a mean fractional flux error correction .",
    "comparing to reflex survey counts @xcite determines most likely parameters .",
    "since the reflex survey is relatively shallow , we choose not to solve for general redshift evolution .",
    "instead , we simply compare cases of self - similar ( @xmath39 ) and no ( @xmath40 ) evolution . for soft x - ray luminosities ,",
    "the expected mass and redshift scalings are somewhat weaker than the bolometric case of equation  ( [ eq : lbolscaling ] ) , @xmath41 , but we employ @xmath39 as a slightly extreme variant .",
    "our analysis is therefore focused on the slope @xmath42 , present - epoch intercept , @xmath43 , at @xmath44 , and the dispersion @xmath37 , which we express in terms of the equivalent dispersion in mass @xmath45 .    a more direct approach to the problem of relating luminosity to mass",
    "involves using individual cluster mass estimates derived under the assumption of strict hydrostatic and/or virial equilibrium .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter rb02 ) perform this analysis with 63 clusters from the flux - limited hiflugcs survey , finding consistency with the power - law expectation , equation  ( [ eq : lsoftscaling ] ) , with a slope slightly steeper than self - similar and with a few tens of percent intrinsic scatter in mass at fixed luminosity .",
    "a promising future approach to this problem is to use weak lensing mass estimates of stacked cluster samples @xcite .    in  [",
    "sec : model ] , we explain the model and our approach to analyzing the reflex survey counts . in  [ sec : results ] , parameter constraints that result from matching the counts are presented and found to be strongly degenerate .",
    "we therefore apply a pair of additional constraints , one based on the clustering of reflex clusters and the other on the observed scatter in the temperature - luminosity relation .",
    "the latter exercise requires input from cosmological simulations of clusters .",
    "we compare to results of rb02 and discuss implications for cluster selection and hydrostatic mass estimates in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "a summary and conclusions are given in ",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",

    "the reader is hereby notified that we employ different hubble constant conventions when presenting values for luminosity and mass .",
    "after briefly introducing the reflex cluster sample used in the analysis , this section details our approach to modeling cluster counts in flux and redshift , including evolutionary corrections .",
    "we use cluster counts from the reflex ( rosat - eso - flux - limited - x - ray ) cluster survey , which covers an area of @xmath57 str and includes 447 identified galaxy clusters down to a flux limit of 3 @xmath58 10@xmath59 ergs s@xmath51 @xmath60 in the ( 0.1 to 2.4 kev ) rosat band @xcite .",
    "the  clusters have been correlated with optical data from the cosmos data base with a relatively low threshold to define a highly complete cluster candidate catalogue .",
    "cluster validation and redshift determinations were achieved by an intense spectroscopic follow - up observing program at the european southern observatory , supplemented by available literature .",
    "luminosity determinations and the first reflex sample release are described in @xcite .",
    "determination of the survey selection function is described in @xcite and references therein .",
    "we do not incorporate selection function uncertainties directly into our analysis .",
    "this simplification is unlikely to significantly affect our conclusions , since at the high flux - limit of the reflex survey the sample is well understood .",
    "@xcite estimate a loss under 5% of clusters in low exposure regions , and tests presented in that work ( figure  25 ) show that this changes the derived luminosity function by less than 2% .",

    "we perform a likelihood analysis on this count distribution in flux and redshift .",
    "3.5truein    we must account for several survey effects when computing model expectations .",
    "our basic model predicts the total flux while the reflex data are based on flux detected within the fixed angular aperture .",
    "we correct the data for this aperture effect by using the extrapolated fluxes calculated by @xcite .",
    "this correction results in an 8% average increase in luminosity , but for a few bright nearby clusters the correction is larger .",
    "we also include a k - correction in our model .",
    "the luminosity @xmath36 in our mass - luminosity relation is the emissivity integrated over the rest - frame , 0.1 - 2.4 kev band , whereas the reflex data are derived from the emissivity over a band redshifted by a factor @xmath61 .",

    "we assign temperatures to halos in a manner described below .",
    "the space density of dark matter halos is now accurately calibrated for the case of hierarchical clustering from an initially gaussian random density field .",
    "we use parameters derived for the mass scale @xmath54 by @xcite , based on the jenkins mass function ( hereafter jmf , @xcite ) form determined from a suite of cosmological simulations .",
    "the jmf is described by a similarity variable @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the variance in the linear density field after top - hat filtering fluctuations on mass scale @xmath53 .",
    "the function @xmath66 is a monotonic decreasing function of mass for bottom - up models of structure formation and its inverse is well fit in the log by a quadratic relation , @xmath67 .",
    "fit parameters for specific models we employ are listed in table  [ table : params ] .",
    "@xcite show that the mass fraction in halos of mass @xmath53 at redshift @xmath68 @xmath69 is well fit by @xmath70 when evaluating the mass function , we use the fact that @xmath71 scales with the linear growth factor of density fluctuations @xmath72 . in addition , the parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 vary linearly with @xmath75 as described in @xcite . the @xmath76 values are listed in table  [ table : params ] .    .filtered power spectrum and jmf parameters [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the most massive and  luminous halos , a change of normalization @xmath77 produces a nearly constant shift in the mass function in the mass direction , such that the mass @xmath78 at fixed space density @xmath79 scales as @xmath80 , with @xmath81 above @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "since observations fix the luminosity at @xmath79 , variations in @xmath77 , and hence the mass scale @xmath78 , can be compensated by adjusting the normalization @xmath83 .",
    "we therefore expect @xmath84 . with @xmath85 , and @xmath86",
    ", the characteristic luminosity should have strong sensitivity to the power spectrum normalization , @xmath87 .",
    "the open symbol in the left panel of figure  [ fig : varomps ] shows the rb02 result , after correction for the flux bias described in the preceding section .",
    "error bars have been enlarged by adding in quadrature the scatter in the corrections derived from the mock hv monte carlo analysis .",
    "the corrected results lie very close to the values determined here .",
    "the right hand panel offers a compromise model driven by cosmological parameters from the wmap year 3 data @xcite .",
    "the model assumes a flat metric with @xmath88 and a slightly elevated normalization @xmath89 , along with a reduced estimate of the scatter @xmath90 .",
    "the resulting best fit parameters are @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "the lower scatter leads to a smaller malmquist bias for the rb02 sample , we derive corrections of @xmath94 to @xmath95 and @xmath96 to @xmath42 .",
    "the corrected rb02 result is then @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and is plotted in the right - hand panel in figure  [ fig : varomps ] .",
    "we concur with the analysis by @xcite that a zero - scatter solution with @xmath99 provides good agreement with the original rb02 result , but we feel that a zero - scatter solution is unphysical .",
    "the large variance in the observed t - l relation has been tied to variations in core emission @xcite .",
    "maintaining a tight l - m relation would require a strong coupling between core gas physics and total halo mass , as well as a large scatter in the virial ( t - m ) relation .",
    "these outcomes are neither anticipated theoretically nor supported by the current generation of numerical simulations .",
    "our model rests on the calibration of the @xmath54 halo space density @xcite .",
    "a full treatment of the theoretical error in the mass function is beyond the scope of this paper , but we comment here on the impact of normalization uncertainties in @xmath100 on the @xmath95 parameter .",
    "simulations by @xcite find agreement with the form we employ at better than ten percent in number over the mass range @xmath101 ( see their fig .",
    "b10 ) . the jmf calibration using percolation , rather than spherical overdensity , masses has been confirmed at the five percent level in number by @xcite using a set of sixteen @xmath102-particle simulations .",
    "that work proposes a slightly more complex formulation to replace our use of equation  ( [ eq : jmf ] ) , but the difference at high masses is only a few percent in number ( see their fig .  2 ) .",
    "these results appear to indicate that the current calibration uncertainty in the halo space density is at the level of @xmath103 in number . for massive ,  luminous halos , where locally @xmath104 , this translates into an error in mass scale of @xmath105 , or an additional @xmath106 uncertainty in @xmath95 .",
    "however , @xcite also find that one out of four non - concordance simulations shows a larger discrepancy with the model expectations , roughly @xmath107 in number .",
    "considering that this is one outlier out of 20 simulations , and given that the remaining @xmath108-body data show much better consistency , we feel that a @xmath109 uncertainty in number density is a conservative upper limit on the theoretical error .",
    "this implies a maximum additional uncertainty in @xmath95 of @xmath110 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty is most likely smaller than , or , at worst , comparable to , the statistical error of @xmath111 .",
    "the use of @xmath112 as a mass measure is not expected to affect the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "assuming an nfw mass profile , appendix b of @xcite calculates a simple shift to the mass scale . shifting the mass scale results in a shift of the jmf , and our normalization parameter",
    "would likewise be translated .",
    "the isothermal @xmath113-model masses employed by rb02 are determined by fitting the azimuthally - averaged  surface brightness to derive the gas density profile under the assumption of isothermality for the intracluster gas .",
    "simulations indicate that this approach may yield masses that are biased by up to a few tens of percent @xcite , but the computational expectations are rendered uncertain by incomplete modeling of icm physics and by systematic errors associated with determining the spectral temperature derived from the thermally complex intracluster medium of simulated clusters @xcite .",
    "the uncomfortably wide range of inferred mass  temperature relations from theory and observations ( table  1 of @xcite , table  3 of @xcite and table  1 of @xcite ) is another reason for caution regarding the accuracy of cluster mass estimates .    from figure",
    "[ fig : varomps ] , it is apparent that implied errors in hydrostatic masses will be model - dependent . for the concordance model with @xmath114",
    ", there is little error in normalization at @xmath115 after taking the flux bias into account . for the wmap cosmology , we tuned agreement in the right panel of figure  [ fig : varomps ] by choosing @xmath116 and @xmath117 . for a power spectrum normalization of @xmath118 ,",
    "our normalization @xmath95 is brighter than the rb02 result by a factor of @xmath119 , indicating that hydrostatic masses are overestimates of the true cluster mass by nearly a factor of 2 .",
    "additional independent estimates of the slope and intercept of the l - m relation would help .",
    "weak lensing analysis of joint  and optical samples is a promising approach that has been applied in a preliminary fashion to clusters in the sdss early data release @xcite .",
    "the lensing mass estimates require careful calibration to eliminate the effects of projection @xcite , but either stacking to acheive spherical symmetry @xcite or analysis of mock data from suitably selected simulated clusters @xcite can be used to validate procedures used to extract mass estimates from shear maps .",
    "@xcite examine the m - t relation at the high - mass end using lensing masses from 30 clusters , finding a higher normalization than studies using isothermal masses , and finding a power spectrum normalization of @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "the large number statistics offered by nearby optical cluster catalogs from sdss @xcite and 2df @xcite , when matched with existing and forthcoming archival  data , should ultimately be exploited for this exercise .",
    "we derive constraints on a model that relates soft  luminosity to halo mass and epoch , @xmath35 , described as a median power - law relation , @xmath122 , with log - normal scatter of fixed width @xmath37 . convolving this with the mass function of a @xmath0cdm universe",
    ", we perform a likelihood analysis on the counts of galaxy clusters in flux and redshift observed in the reflex survey for specific cases of self - similar ( @xmath39 ) and no evolution ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "a strong degeneracy between the intercept and scatter in the model means that counts place only an upper limit on the degree of scatter in mass at fixed luminosity @xmath3 .    to improve the estimate of the scatter ,",
    "we apply additional constraints based on the clustering bias of a volume - limited reflex sub - sample and on the intrinsic variance of the observed temperature  luminosity relation . because the survey probes halo mass scales where the bias is relatively weakly dependent on mass , and because the measured clustering has a substantial uncertainty , the addition of bias has little practical effect on allowed parameters . using gas dynamical simulations of clusters to probe the inter - relationships of @xmath124",
    ", we derive an estimate @xmath4 from the observed scatter in the t - l relation .    after applying these additional constraints , we derive best - fit parameters @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 for a concordance cosmology with @xmath128 and a self - similar evolutionary assumption . the slope and normalization increase , by @xmath129 and @xmath130 respectively , under a no evolution assumption .",
    "exploring sensitivity to the assumed ( flat - metric ) cosmology , we find @xmath131 for fixed @xmath75 and @xmath132 when @xmath133 is held fixed . when applying a cosmological model guided by wmap results , @xmath88 , @xmath134 , and a lower constraint on the scatter , we derive best - fit parameters which include a much higher normalization term , @xmath91 , @xmath135 , @xmath93 .",
    "our concordance - model result differs from that determined by rb02 using hydrostatic ( isothermal - beta model ) mass estimates , being lower in normalization by roughly a factor of two .",
    "we show that a bias of this magnitude is expected for the direct l - m relation derived from a flux limited sample , due to a malquist bias induced by the survey selection process .",
    "correcting for this bias leads to quite good agreement between the two approaches , implying that systematic uncertainties in hydrostatic mass estimates are unlikely to be larger than @xmath17 . to accommodate the change in cosmology preferred by wmap observations ,",
    "we offer a compromise solution with slightly elevated @xmath136 and lower intrinsic scatter @xmath137 .",
    "independent approaches to determining the l - m scaling relation , particularly through weak gravitational lensing analysis , should be vigorously pursued .",
    "we anticipate that the approach used here can be fruitfully applied to relations between other observables , such as @xmath138 temperature or sunyaev - zeldovich decrement , and underlying mass .",
    "the coming era of large area , deep cluster surveys , coupled with increasingly detailed numerical simulations , will drive progress , for example , by allowing the evolutionary parameter @xmath2 to be directly constrained and by enabling investigation of the detailed form of the likelihood @xmath35 .",
