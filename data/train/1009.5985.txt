    "conformal field theory was originally conceived in four and three dimensions , with applications to particle physics and critical phenomena in mind .",
    "however , it is in 2d that the most spectacular results and exact solutions have been obtained . in higher dimensions , there seems to be a general feeling that the constraining power of conformal symmetry _ by itself _ is insufficient to tell nontrivial things about dynamics .",
    "hence the interest in various additional assumptions , like supersymmetry , or integrability for the planar @xmath16 super yang - mills , or the ads / cft duality .",
    "this is not fully satisfactory , since there are likely many 4d cfts which do not fulfill any of these assumptions .",
    "for example , conformal windows \" of non - supersymmetric gauge theories .    and",
    "yet , in the early days of 4d cft , it was hoped that the _ ope associativity _ is such a strong constraint on the cft data ( the spectrum of operator dimensions and the 3-point function coefficients ) that it could allow for a complete solution of the theory . recently @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite we have been taking a fresh look at this idea , originally proposed by polyakov @xcite .",
    "our approach is not to try to _ solve _ the ope associativity , but rather to try to deduce from it general bounds that any cft must obey .",
    "we discovered that such general bounds do exist !",
    "the bounds found so far fall into two general classes :    * @xcite,@xcite an upper bound on the gap in the operator spectrum : _ any unitary 4d cft containing a scalar operator _",
    "@xmath1 _ of dimension _",
    "@xmath17 _ must also contain another scalar _",
    "@xmath18 _ appearing in the ope",
    "_ @xmath19 _ whose dimension _",
    "@xmath20 _ is bounded by a universal function of _ @xmath17__:__@xmath21 the function @xmath22 has been computed numerically by means of a well - defined algorithm . * upper bounds on the 3-point function coefficients @xmath23 where @xmath1 is the same scalar as above and @xmath18 is any primary operator in the ope @xmath19 .",
    "they have the form:@xmath24 where @xmath25 is a universal function of the dimensions and of the @xmath18 s spin @xmath26 . for @xmath27",
    "this function was evaluated in @xcite .",
    "very recently , the case @xmath28 @xmath29 , corresponding to the stress tensor ope coefficient , was considered in  @xcite,@xcite . in this case",
    "the upper bound ( [ eq : intr2 ] ) gives a lower bound on the central charge of the theory .    in this paper",
    ", we will discuss a generalization of bounds of the first class to the case when cft has a continuous global symmetry @xmath30 ( abelian or non - abelian ) , and an operator @xmath1 transforms in a nontrivial representation @xmath2 of @xmath30 .",
    "we will consider the ope @xmath31 if @xmath2 is complex , or @xmath19 if @xmath2 is real .",
    "we will be discussing how to show that this ope necessarily contains a _ singlet _ _ scalar _ operator @xmath32 whose dimension @xmath33 is bounded by a universal function which depends only on @xmath1 s dimension and transformation properties:@xmath34 thus the novelty with respect to @xcite,@xcite  is that we will be bounding the gap in a given global symmetry sector ( singlet in this case ) .",
    "it is useful to recall that the original motivation of @xcite was to find a bound of precisely this type for the case @xmath35 and @xmath1 in the fundamental .",
    "this in turn was needed in order to constrain the conformal technicolor scenario of electroweak symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "this connection was discussed extensively in @xcite , and we will come back to it in the discussion section .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first derive the vectorial sum rules \" , which generalize the main equation encoding the ope associativity  the sum rule of @xcite  to the globally symmetric case . not surprisingly , these new sum rules take a different form depending on @xmath30 and @xmath2 under consideration . to begin with ,",
    "we treat three concrete examples : @xmath1 in the fundamental of @xmath6 ; @xmath1 charged under a @xmath36 ; @xmath1 in the fundamental of @xmath7 . here",
    "we provide explicit derivations , illustrating the necessary technical ingredients .",
    "we then consider the general case in some detail , and in particular show that the number of constraints from crossing symmetry is always equal to the number of unknown functions .",
    "then we discuss what our vectorial sum rules imply for the bounds on the singlet dimension . in principle , functions @xmath37 can be computed by a straightforward generalization of the algorithm of @xcite",
    ". however , numerical difficulties involved are much greater in the present case , because one is working in a linear space of a much bigger dimension . as a result",
    ", we can not yet push our analysis to the point where it produces numerically significant bounds .",
    "thus we follow a more modest strategy .",
    "first , we explain how one shows that a bound does exist for @xmath17 sufficiently close to 1 .",
    "the main idea is to consider the case @xmath38 and then to argue by continuity ( which is possible since the vectorial sum rules are continuous in @xmath17 ) .",
    "this analysis also shows that @xmath37 approaches @xmath9 as @xmath39 . in other words , just like in our previous work , the free field theory limit is approached continuously .",
    "the next question is then to determine how fast @xmath37 approaches this limit .",
    "here we limit ourselves to quoting several @xmath37 values at @xmath40 , leaving the determination of a detailed shape of these bounds to future work .",
    "we conclude by discussing consequences for phenomenology and promising research directions",
    ".    * note .",
    "* as this work was being prepared for publication , a very interesting paper @xcite appeared , which gave several important generalizations of our method and results .",
    "in particular , @xcite generalized our method to the @xmath41 scft case , and used it to derive bounds on non - bps quantities .",
    "they also derived lower bounds on the central charge and on the two - point functions of global symmetry currents , with or without supersymmetry .",
    "finally , they presented a set of equations incorporating ope associativity constraints in the case of a @xmath36 global symmetry .",
    "they have even derived a bound on the @xmath36 singlet dimension ( in the supersymmetric case ) .",
    "we will be commenting on this partial overlap in more detail below .",
    "we begin with some preliminary comments and notational conventions .",
    "we will work in the euclidean space . just as in our previous work ,",
    "availability of explicit expressions for 4d conformal blocks given by dolan and osborn @xcite will play a crucial role . consider a 4-point function @xmath42 where @xmath1 and @xmath43 are two primary operators , not necessarily hermitean , assumed to have equal dimensions @xmath44 .",
    "the ope @xmath45 will contain a sequence of spin @xmath46 dimension @xmath47 primary fields @xmath48 , : @xmath49 here @xmath50 are the ope coefficients , in general complex .",
    "we then normalize the conformal blocks via:@xmath51{cc}\\phi(x_{1})_{\\bullet } & _ { \\bullet}\\phi^{\\dagger}(x_{4})\\\\ \\chi^{\\dagger}(x_{2})^{\\bullet } & ^{\\bullet}\\chi(x_{3 } ) \\end{array } \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{\\delta , l}\\frac{1}{x_{12}^{2d}x_{34}^{2d}}\\,p_{\\delta , l}\\,g_{\\delta , l}(u , v)\\,,\\label{eq : confblocks}\\\\ u\\equiv x_{12}^{2}x_{34}^{2}/(x_{13}^{2}x_{24}^{2})=z\\bar{z},\\quad v\\equiv x_{14}^{2}x_{23}^{2}/(x_{13}^{2}x_{24}^{2})\\,=(1-z)(1-\\bar{z})\\,,\\\\ g_{\\delta , l}(u , v)=+\\frac{z\\bar{z}}{z-\\bar{z}}[k_{\\delta+l}(z)k_{\\delta -l-2}(\\bar{z})-(z\\leftrightarrow\\bar{z})]\\,,\\\\ k_{\\beta}(x)\\equiv x^{\\beta/2}{}_{2}f_{1}\\left (   \\beta/2,\\beta/2,\\beta ; x\\right )   \\,.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] the points @xmath52 are assumed to be near the vertices of a square , as the picture suggests .",
    "the ordering is important .",
    "( [ eq : confblocks ] ) says that the exchanges of @xmath48 and of its conformal descendants in the ( 12)(34 ) channel ( @xmath53s - channel ) can be summed up in a ` conformal block ' @xmath54 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath55 are given by @xmath56    compared to @xcite , and also to our previous work , we have dropped the @xmath57 prefactor in the expression for @xmath58 .",
    "this normalization is more convenient for the following reason . in the new convention",
    "all conformal blocks are positive  when operators are inserted at the vertices of a square in the shown order ( this corresponds to @xmath59 ) .",
    "this is just as it should be , because this configuration is reflection - positive in the osterwalder - shrader sense with respect to the vertical median line ( notice that the fields in the two sides of the correlator are complex - conjugate of each other ) .",
    "configurations corresponding to such @xmath60 can be mapped onto a rectangle , which is reflection - positive . ] .",
    "thus @xmath61 s - channel contribution to the correlator , even spin or odd , has to be positive .",
    "there is no disagreement with doland and osborn @xcite , because in their notation the extra minus sign would be offset by a change in the sign of the ope coefficient in the rhs of the correlator .",
    "the ( 14)(23 ) channel @xmath62t - channel ) conformal block decomposition can be analyzed similarly . in this case",
    "we will need opes @xmath31 and @xmath63 and only fields appearing in both of these opes will give a nonzero contribution , proportional to the product of the two ope coefficients .",
    "in @xcite we have analyzed the particular case when @xmath1 is hermitean and @xmath64 . in this case the s- and t - channels correspond to the same ope ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "in addition , only even spins contribute because of permutation symmetry @xmath65 .",
    "let us introduce the notation for the sum of all s - channel contributions:@xmath66 @xmath67 means that we are summing over even spins only ) and a tilde notation for a contribution of the same set of operators in the t - channel:@xmath68 here we used the fact that going from the s- to the t - channel , which means simply rotating the picture by @xmath69 , interchanges @xmath70 and @xmath71 . in this notation the crossing symmetry constraint of @xcite",
    "is written compactly as:@xmath72 the appearance of the ( @xmath73 factor in this relation is due to a nontrivial transformation of the prefactor @xmath74 in ( [ eq : confblocks ] ) under crossing .    finally , an important technical remark . unlike in @xcite , to extract full information from the 4-point function ( [ eq : confblocks ] ) , we will have to consider not only the s- and t - channel opes , but also the u - channel ones ( 13)(24 ) .",
    "conformal blocks for such ` diagonal ' opes are related to the nearest - neighbor conformal blocks discussed above by analytic continuation , which introduces spin - dependent signs into the crossing - symmetry constraints . a useful way to keep track of these signs",
    "is not to consider the u - channel ope directly , but to instead apply the s- and t - channel decompositions to the 4-point function with the permuted insertion points : @xmath75{cc}\\phi(x_{1})_{\\bullet } & _ { \\bullet}\\chi(x_{4})\\\\ \\chi^{\\dagger}(x_{2})^{\\bullet } & ^{\\bullet}\\phi^{\\dagger}(x_{3 } ) \\end{array } \\right\\rangle\\ ] ] here , we transposed the fields in the right side of the correlator . now in the t - channel we have the same ope as we would have in the u - channel in ( [ eq : confblocks ] ) . and",
    "in the s - channel we have the same ope  as in ( [ eq : confblocks ] ) , except for the transposition .",
    "this transposition is taken into account by reversing the sign of the odd - spin contributions in the s - channel ( and permuting the flavor indices accordingly , see below ) .",
    "as a first example we will now consider the @xmath6 global symmetry case , with a scalar primary operator @xmath76 transforming in the fundamental representation .",
    "we normalize the 2-point function of @xmath76 as @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",

    "however , permutation symmetry of the @xmath85 state implies that the spins of the @xmath32 s and @xmath86 s will be even , while they will be odd for the @xmath87 s .",
    "we note in passing that the stress tensor will be an @xmath32 of @xmath88 , while the conserved @xmath6 current will be an @xmath87 of @xmath89,@xmath90 .",

    "the simplest cases of these bounds have already been explored in @xcite,@xcite . in this paper",
    "we will not be making any assumptions about the central charges of the theory and will treat the stress tensor and the current on equal footing with all the other fields .",
    "( however , in future studies central charge information may be useful ; see the discussion section . )    on the other hand , it will be important for us that the unit operator @xmath91  is always present in the @xmath79 ope , with a unit coefficient .    as mentioned in the introduction",

    "yet it is not useless to give a derivation of such a result  that at @xmath38 there must be a singlet scalar of dimension @xmath301using our method based on the vectorial sum rule .",
    "the reason is very simple : unlike the derivation sketched above , our method is robust with respect to small variations in @xmath17 . if we show that it works at @xmath38 , it is guaranteed to work as well for @xmath17 sufficiently close to @xmath302 .",
    "thus we will know that a bound _ exists _ for @xmath17 close to @xmath302 and , since it is a continuous function of @xmath17 , that it approaches 2 as @xmath39 .",

    "that question is also relevant to asses the viability of the so called conformal technicolor ( ct ) scenario @xcite .",
    "the goal of ct is to achieve a natural separation between the electroweak scale and the scale of flavor .",
    "that is motivated by the experimental success of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa pattern of flavor violation .",
    "the way ct works is that the electroweak symmetry breaking sector above the weak scale flows to a strongly coupled cft .",
    "the role of the higgs field is then played by a composite operator @xmath121 , while electroweak gauge interactions arise from the weak gauging of a @xmath377 subgroup of the global symmetry group @xmath30 of the cft .",
    "in that situation , suppression of flavor violation is the more robust the closer to @xmath302 is the dimension @xmath378 of @xmath121 . on the other hand , a natural separation of mass scale requires all total singlet scalars to be only marginally relevant or irrelevant .",
    "indicating by @xmath32 the lowest dimension singlet @xmath379 , we thus need @xmath33 slightly below or above @xmath242 .",
    "is strictly @xmath380 we need some other marginally relevant coupling , or a strongly relevant coupling which can be taken small because of an extra symmetry , to generate the weak scale by dimensional transmutation . ]",
    "a major constraint on @xmath378 is imposed by the top coupling , that runs like @xmath381 and quickly becomes strong for @xmath382 .",
    "notice that one major difficulty to achieve the dream of ct is that for @xmath383 we must have @xmath384 and the hierarchy problem in all its splendor",
    ".    to be more quantitative about the needed pattern of field dimensions , assumptions on the physics of flavor must be made . making the optimistic ,",
    "although plausible , assumption that flavor violation in the light families is either suppressed by their mixing to the third family of by their yukawa couplings , operators contributing to @xmath385-mixing , this amounts to assuming respectively an extra suppression factor @xmath386 or @xmath387 compared to operators involving just the third family quarks . ]",
    "the range @xmath388 , @xmath389 is sufficient . in that situation",
    "the scale where the top yukawa becomes strong can be as low as @xmath390 tev , so that the window where ct is active is not very big . on the other hand ,",
    "the more conservative , but robust , assumption that all flavor violating operators are equally important at the flavor scale requires the more constrained pattern @xmath391 , @xmath392 .",
    "that second situation corresponds to a flavor scale around @xmath393 tev , with the cft describing physics in a sizeable window of scales . in view of the above , it would be interesting to derive , if it exists , an upper bound on @xmath33 as a function of @xmath378 which was one goal of the present paper .",
    "indeed in @xcite a first step toward an answer was given by deriving an upper bound on @xmath394 , where @xmath395 is the dimension of the triplet scalar @xmath379 .",
    "the method of @xcite was however symmetry blind \" in that it could not resolving the singlet and triplet channels . in @xcite",
    "a further refinement of the bound was obtained by working up to 18 derivatives in function space .",
    "the bound is a monotonically growing function of @xmath378 crossing 4 at about @xmath396 .",
    "that result is compatible with the flavor - optimistic ct scenario .",
    "given the clear signs of convergence of the symmetry blind bound @xcite , and also given the remarkable success of the method in 2d cfts where the bound basically tracks minimal models , we are tempted to conclude that the flavor - optimistic ct scenario is plausible . however",
    "the bound of @xcite , if interpreted as a bound on @xmath33 ( that is if @xmath397 ) , would thoroughly rule out the flavor - robust ct .    in the present paper",
    "we have instead shown that it is possible to obtain an independent bound on the singlet .",
    "we have rigorously shown that the bound on @xmath33 exists and goes smoothly to 2 as @xmath355 for @xmath1 a fundamental in @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath339 ( @xmath343 ) .",
    "we have further worked it out numerically for a few small groups , and in particular for @xmath361 , which is the smallest group of phenomenological relevance .",
    "the results are not yet very strong , as seen in table 1 . in particular , in @xmath361",
    ", @xmath33 crosses 4 already for @xmath398 , way within the interesting region of flavor - robust ct .",
    "one reason for the weakness of the bound is that our numerical method based on the linear programming algorithm does not converge fast enough when the function space is truncated beyond @xmath353 derivatives .",
    "so our best bound just corresponds to working up to @xmath353 .",
    "one reason of the extra difficulty with respect to the symmetry blind case is that we are now dealing with a triple sum rule , rather than with a single one , and the complexity grows @xmath399 times faster with @xmath235 .",
    "notice that even in the symmetry blind case the bounds at low @xmath235 are not very strong .",
    "indeed one has the progression @xmath400 @xcite , @xmath401 @xmath402 ( unpublished ) , @xmath403 ( @xmath404 @xcite , eventually increased to @xmath405 for @xmath406 @xcite . assuming a similar rate of improvement for the globally symmetric bound , and assuming optimistically that we could push the analysis to similarly high values of @xmath235 ( which would likely require new ideas in algorithm implementation )",
    ", we could expect to get to @xmath407 @xmath408 for the @xmath361 case .",
    "this is more or less at the edge of interest of the flavor - robust ct .",
    "it is important to understand why the globally symmetric bounds are so weak , and why they are getting even weaker at larger @xmath143 , as shown in table 1 .",
    "one could imagine two alternative explanations .",
    "one , boring , possibility is that crossing symmetry for the 4-point function of just one operator @xmath158 is simply not an efficient constraint in presence of global symmetry",
    ". it would be more interesting if , perhaps , our result is telling us something physical , namely that for larger global symmetry , the role of the singlet @xmath32 in maintaining consistency of the theory is indeed getting smaller , so that it can be allowed to decouple",
    ". a very partial hint of that could be the fact , already emphasized in @xcite , that in the @xmath409 model in @xmath410 dimensions the anomalous dimension of the singlet is @xmath411 while that of the symmetric traceless is @xmath412 .",
    "one way to test which of the two possibilities is true is to derive a twin bound on the symmetric traceless @xmath86 ( without imposing any constraints on the singlet @xmath32 ) . if also that bound were found to be weak , the first possibility would be favored .",
    "if , on the other hand , the symmetric traceless bound would turn up much stronger than the singlet one , and perhaps comparable in strength to the general bound of @xcite , @xcite on the @xmath413 , then this would be an indication that tensor is much more important than singlet in maintaining the crossing symmetry .",
    "note that , as far as we know , there s no simple reason why the bounds get weaker with larger @xmath143 . at this stage",
    "this is just an experimental fact .",
    "there is yet another piece of information which , if taken into account , could change the picture qualitatively . in our numerical study",
    "we did not make any assumption about the stress tensor and symmetry current central charges . in principle",
    "our bound could become stronger under the condition that these central charges are bounded from above , corresponding to a perhaps more reasonable theory , that is one that does not contain too many degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , in connection to our main phenomenological application , the common wisdom is that constraints from the @xmath32 parameter point towards a small ewsb sector , so that the central charges should be small .",
    "this is especially true of the current central charge , because the current - current spectral density enters directly into the spectral representation of the @xmath32 parameter .",
    "since conformal symmetry is broken in the ir , only the high energy tail of this density will be controlled by the cft central charge .",
    "this does not allow to make this connection precise , but still large central charge seems to be disfavored .",
    "what one could do then is to study a lower bound on the central charge as a function of the gap in the singlet scalar sector . for the stress",
    "tensor central charge in the case without global symmetry , precisely such a study was performed in @xcite .",
    "these studies are made possible by the existence of @xmath414 universal bounds on the coefficients @xmath55 in the conformal block decomposition @xcite , and that the coefficients @xmath415 and @xmath416 can be related to the inverse central charges by the ward identities @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we found that higher gap sometimes requires a significant increase in the stress tensor central charge .",
    "if the current central charge is shown to have an even stronger dependence on the singlet scalar gap , this may indicate a potential difficulty with the @xmath32 parameter for ct .",
    "notice that central charge studies are also interesting in their own right , without connection to ct .",
    "for example , can one show that an @xmath6 theory with a fundamental necessarily has central charges larger than free theory of @xmath143 scalars ?",
    "for the stress tensor central charge and the case without global symmetry this was shown in @xcite,@xcite ( in a range of @xmath17 near @xmath302 ) .    in passing",
    ", one could imagine one day bounds like those discussed in this paper would make contact with the studies of ir fixed points of gauge theories performed on the lattice . since the very existence of an ir fixed point implies that these theories can not contain a singlet scalar with dimension below 4 , our bounds could provide rigorous theoretical constraints on the lattice measurements of the fermion bilinear operator dimension @xcite .",
    "the framework laid out in this paper will likely lead to many applications beyond those mentioned above .",
    "be aware that the next crucial steps are an algorithm improvement and/or finding if there exists a set of questions for which the convergence is faster , so that interesting bounds can be obtained already at small @xmath235 .",
