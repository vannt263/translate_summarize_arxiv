    "in the general picture of non - commutative geometry , cyclic homology plays the role of compactly supported de rham cohomology ; it was introduced by a. connes as the target of the chern character .",
    "the dual theory is cyclic cohomology , which plays the role of closed de rham homology .",
    "the pairing between these two is an important tool in performing numerical computations of k - theory classes ( indices ) .",
    "often the non - commutative space we have to deal with is an orbit space of an tale groupoid ; in particular , any tale groupoid can be viewed as such a non - commutative space .",
    "this fits in with grothendieck s idea of what a `` generalized space '' is ( @xcite ) , and includes examples like leaf spaces of foliations , orbit spaces of group actions on manifolds , orbifolds .",
    "to say what the groups @xmath1 look like is an important step in solving index problems and in understanding the connection between the topology and the analysis of `` leaf spaces '' ( here we have in mind in particular the baum - connes assembly map @xcite ) .",
    "the computation of @xmath1 was started by connes for the case where @xmath2 is a manifold ( @xcite ) , burghelea for the case where @xmath3 is a group ( @xcite ) and by feigin , tsygan and nistor for crossed products by groups ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the general strategy is to decompose these homology groups as direct sums of localized homologies ; there are two different kinds of components which behave differently . following the terminology introduced in @xcite ,",
    "these are called elliptic and hyperbolic components .",
    "usually the hyperbolic ones are more difficult to compute and involve in a deeper way the combinatorics of the groupoid .    in the general setting of smooth tale groupoids",
    "the results were partially extended by brylinski and nistor ( @xcite ) : for a _ hausdorff _ tale groupoid @xmath4 , the localized homologies @xmath5 are defined for any invariant open space @xmath6 of loops ; the _ elliptic _ components are computed in terms of double complexes ; in particular the localization at units is related to the homology of the classifying space @xmath7 .",
    "there are some important questions left :    \\1 ) compute the hyperbolic components ;    \\2 ) remove the hausdorffness condition ( simple examples coming from foliations are non - hausdorff ) ;    \\3 ) find a way to book - keep the computations ; in particular give a more conceptual proof and a more conceptual meaning of the results .",
    "the initial intention of the author ( after studying the computations made in @xcite ) was to answer the last question ; this led to the definition of a homology theory for tale groupoids ( which could be called cohomology with compact support as well ) developed in @xcite .",
    "this homology turned out to be extremely helpful in answering all the questions above , among others .",
    "as it is very flexible , we expect it to be useful also in understanding the baum - connes assembly map .",
    "the approach and the results of this paper owe a great deal to the previous work of several authors , especially brylinski ( @xcite ) , burghelea ( @xcite ) and nistor ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the computation we give for the localization at units is , beyond the formalism , the same as the one given in @xcite ; to the same paper we owe the important idea of reduction to loops ( proposition [ redloops ] ) .",
    "the method for computing the other localizations are inspired by the initial work of burghelea @xcite ; the difficulty is that the topological arguments used in that paper do not work in this generality any more .",
    "an older idea ( @xcite ) that working with classifying toposes ( i.e. sheaves ) might be easier than working with classifying spaces ( and this was pointed out , for the first time in our context , in the same paper @xcite ) becomes essential for us . with this in mind",
    ", our job is to replace the classifying spaces used by burghelea by suitable sheaves on tale categories and the topological arguments by a suitable algebraic - topological formalism ( long exact sequences and spectral sequences for homology of tale groupoids ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the basic definitions and properties of sheaves on tale groupoids and their homology and show how the hausdorffness assumption can be dropped .",
    "it is important to point out that our definition ( see [ our ] ) of compactly supported forms on non - hausdorff manifolds ( which was first introduced in @xcite ) is related to , but not the same as the one given by connes ( section 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "ours has basic properties , like the existence of a de rham differential , which are not shared by connes ( as remarked in the introduction of @xcite ) ; it is also the right object for extending poincar - duality to non - hausdorff manifolds ( @xcite ) . for this reasons we expect it to be useful also in other problems which deal with foliations with non - hausdorff graph .    in section 3",
    "we introduce the homology of groupoids with coefficients in cyclic sheaves ( subsection 3.2 ) ; more generally , given a cyclic groupoid ( i.e. a groupoid with an action of @xmath8 on it , see [ cycat ] ) we consider twisted cyclic sheaves ( for which the usual identity @xmath9 is replaced by @xmath10the action of the generator @xmath11 , see [ twist ] ) . in subsection 3.3",
    "we prove the main technical results concerning these homologies ; at the end we derive as a simple consequence the eilenberg - zilber - type spectral sequence for cyclic objects which is one of the main results in @xcite .",
    "the older approaches to cyclic homology of crossed products by ( discrete ) groups can not be directly extended to the setting of tale groupoids ; we show in subsection 3.4 how cyclic groupoids can be used to overcome this problem . in particular",
    "we extend the feigin - tsygan - nistor spectral sequences ( @xcite ) and nistor s description of the @xmath12 boundary ( @xcite ) .",

    "we also give a more concrete description of @xmath14 .",
    "see theorem [ lastt ] ;    \\6 ) in subsection 4.3 we show how the methods apply to _ _ co__homology .",
    "in particular we get that the pairing between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a poincar - duality pairing , so it is highly non - trivial .",
    "see [ cohelliptic ] , [ of ]  .",
    "\\7 ) for group - actions on manifolds we get the old results for the elliptic components ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and a new description of the hyperbolic ones ( see corollary [ off ] )  ;    \\8 ) for foliations we prove that the cyclic homology is a well defined invariant of the leaf space of the foliation , in the sense that the process of reducing to the setting of smooth tale groupoids does not depend on the choice of the complete transversal ( see theorem [ folinv ] ) .",
