    "the achievable rate for a time - selective fading channel depends on what channel state information ( csi ) is available at the receiver and transmitter .",
    "namely , csi at the receiver can increase the rate by allowing coherent detection , and csi at the transmitter allows adaptive rate and power control ( e.g. , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) ) . obtaining csi at the receiver and/or transmitter requires overhead in the form of a pilot signal and feedback .",
    "we consider a correlated time - selective flat rayleigh fading channel , which is unknown at both the receiver and transmitter .",
    "the transmitter divides its power between a pilot , used to estimate the channel at the receiver , and the data .",
    "given an average transmitted power constraint , our problem is to optimize the instantaneous pilot and data powers as functions of the time - varying channel realization .",
    "our performance objective is a lower bound on the achievable rate , which accounts for the channel estimation error .    power control with channel state feedback , assuming the channel is perfectly known at the receiver , has been considered in @xcite .",
    "there the focus is on optimizing the input distribution for different channel models using criteria such as rate maximization and outage minimization .",
    "optimal power allocation in the presence of channel estimation error has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the problem of optimal pilot design for a variety of fading channel models has been considered in @xcite . there",
    "the pilot power and placement , once optimized , is fixed and is not adapted with the channel conditions . a key difference here",
    "is that the transmitter uses the csi to adapt _ jointly _ the instantaneous data and pilot powers .",
    "because the channel is correlated in time , adapting the pilot power with the estimated channel state can increase the achievable rate .",
    "we also remark that although we analyze a single narrowband fading channel , our results apply to a set of parallel fading gaussian channels , where the average power is split over all channels .",
    "we start with a correlated block fading model in which the sequence of channel gains is gauss - markov with known statistics at the receiver . the channel estimate is updated at the beginning of each block using a kalman filter , and determines the power for the data , and the power for the pilot symbols in the succeeding coherence block .",
    "optimal power control policies are specified implicitly through a bellman equation @xcite .",
    "other dynamic programming formulations of power control problems have been presented in @xcite , although in that work the channel is either known perfectly ( perhaps with a delay ) , or is unknown and not estimated .    because an analytical solution to the bellman equation appears to be difficult to obtain , we study a diffusion limit in which the correlation between successive coherence blocks tends to one and the average power goes to zero .",
    "( this corresponds to a wideband channel model in which the available power is divided uniformly over a large number of parallel flat rayleigh fading sub - channels . ) in this limit , the gauss - markov channel becomes a continuous - time ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite , and the bellman equation becomes a partial differential equation ( pde ) .",
    "a diffusion equation is also derived , which describes the evolution of the state ( channel estimate and the associated error variance ) , given a power allocation policy . in this limit",
    ", we show that given a peak power constraint for the pilot power , the optimal pilot power control policy is a switching policy ( `` bang - bang '' control ) : the pilot power is either the maximum allowable or zero , depending upon the current state .",
    "hence the optimal pilot power control policy requires at most one feedback bit per coherence block .",
    "also , the optimal data power control policy is found to be a variation of waterfilling @xcite",
    ". other work in which the wireless channel is modeled as a diffusion process is presented in @xcite .",
    "the switching points for the optimal policy form a contour in the state space , which is referred to as the _ free boundary _ for the corresponding pde . solving this pde then falls in the class of _ free boundary problems _ @xcite .",
    "we show that in the diffusion limit the system state becomes confined to a narrow region along the boundary .",
    "furthermore , the associated probability distribution over the boundary is exponential .",
    "that enables a numerical characterization of the boundary shape .",
    "our results show that the average pilot power should decrease as the channel becomes more severely faded .",
    "we observe that the optimal switching policy is equivalent to adapting the pilot symbol insertion rate with _ fixed _",
    "pilot symbol energy .",
    "the optimal pilot insertion rate as a function of the channel estimate is then determined by the shape of the free boundary .",
    "we show that the boundary shape essentially shifts pilot power from more probable ( faded ) states to less probable ( good ) states .",
    "furthermore , the boundary shape guarantees that the channel estimate is sufficiently accurate to guide the power adaptation .",
    "numerical results show that pilot power adaptation can provide substantial gains in achievable rates ( up to a factor of two ) .",
    "the gains are more pronounced at low snrs and with fast fading channels .",
    "although these results are derived in the limit of large bandwidth ( low snr ) , monte carlo simulations show that they provide an accurate estimate of the performance when the bandwidth is large but finite ( a few hundred coherence bands ) .",
    "moreover , the optimal switching policy in the diffusion limit accurately approximates the optimal pilot power control policy for the discrete - time model , and provides essentially the same performance gains relative to constant pilot power .    to limit the overall feedback rate",
    ", we also consider combining the adaptive pilot power with `` on - off '' data power control , which also switches between a fixed positive value and zero .",
    "( hence that also requires at most one bit feedback per coherence block . )",
    "the corresponding optimal free boundaries are computed , and results show that this scheme gives negligible loss in the achievable rate .",
    "the next section presents the system model and section [ discrete ] formulates the pilot optimization problem as a dynamic program .",
    "section [ cont ] presents the associated diffusion limit and the corresponding bellman equation .",
    "the optimal policy is then characterized in sections [ solanal]-[water ] with optimal data power control , and in section [ on - off ] with optimal on - off data power control .",

    "the receiver updates the channel estimate during each coherence block with a kalman filter @xcite , given the model ( [ eq : gm ] ) and the pilot symbols , and relays the estimate back to the transmitter .",
