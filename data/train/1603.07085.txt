    ", it intends to redefine certain uniform conditions , e.g. chemical freeze - out conditions , which should be also satisfied by the thermodynamic properties of the fireball at the stage of the chemical freeze - out . in section [ sec : cfoc ] , we have compared the extracted @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the measured particle ratios with the parameters obtained from different freeze - out conditions .",

    "we show that their values can be obtained from the extracted freeze - out parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite , which in this case represent the thermodynamic properties of the fireball at full chemical equilibrium and in most central collisions at mid - rapidity . from @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite , we find for instance that the resulting temperature agrees well with the lattice qcd pseudo - critical temperature",

    ", the temperature does not vary so much .",
    "additionally , we conclude that the real test of the chemical freeze - out conditions at low energy ( large @xmath1 ) is the one where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are changing very rapidly with changing @xmath4 . in this energy ( or @xmath1 ) range",
    ", the differentiation between the various chemical freeze - out conditions likely becomes obvious .",
    "we have reanalysed some chemical freeze - out conditions in framework of hrg model and compared them with new ones .",
    "the calculations are performed in full chemical equilibrium in grand canonical ensemble with zero - width approximation .",
    "the excluded - volume corrections are not applied .",
    "most of conditions match well with the chemical freeze - out parameters , which are extracted from fitting the measured particle ratios with their calculations in the hrg model . in doing this , at least two free parameters ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 are to be tuned .",
    "this assures the conservation laws of strangeness , charge and baryon numbers and are to be controlled by the phase space .",
    "some of these conditions are ratios between two extensive thermodynamic quantities , such as @xmath19 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus , it is almost identical to study them with or without excluded - volume corrections .",

    "we assume that the radii of mesons and baryons are vanishing .",
    "the scope of this work is defining interrelations among various chemical freeze - out conditions .",
    "evc probably comes up with corrections to various thermodynamic quantities .",
    "these likely should not change their interrelations .",
    "it is obvious that all conditions are effected by the mass cut - off , especially at small @xmath1 , as given in the left - had panels of the first five figures . with increasing the resonance masses ,",
    "their contributions increase and consequently lower temperatures are able to fulfil the given freeze - out conditions .",
    "thus , at different resonance mass limits , different @xmath0 are able to fulfil the condition .      1 .",
    "the condition @xmath17 coincides with @xmath18 @xcite , especially at small baryon chemical potential .",
    "2 .   at small @xmath1",
    ", the two conditions @xmath19 and @xmath20 have approximately the same dimensionless value , i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "it can be assume that these interrelations can be generalized to the whole range of chemical potentials .",
    "this would make it possible to consider the possibility to interpret the different conditions as different aspects of one universal condition . at small or even vanishing @xmath1 ,",
    "this value leads to @xmath86 .",
    "4 .   @xmath20 turns to be related to @xmath19 as long as @xmath84 remains constant .",
    "5 .   at small baryon chemical potential",
    ", a clear relation is found between trace anomaly , normalized entropy and @xmath84 .",
    "as long as @xmath84 remains constant and @xmath1 is very small , @xmath113 and @xmath17 are found equivalent .",
    "most of freeze - out conditions coincide with the experimental measurements at high energy .",
    "this agreement becomes weaker , at lower energies .",
    "we would like to highlight that these conclusions should be restricted to the constrains made in this study ; full chemical equilibrium , zero - width approximation and grand - canonical ensemble framework .",
    "but these collusions are correct at high energy . at lower energies ,",
    "the freeze - out conditions are no longer dominant or precise in order to draw edge - cutting conclusion .",
    "the proposed interrelations among the various chemical freeze - out conditions , which have been so far achieved partly , lead to interpreting the different conditions as different aspects from fewer universal conditions ..",
    "recent studies suggest that the chemical freeze - out occurs in a slightly non - equilibrium situation , for instance , due to hadron inelastic rescattering and non - equilibrium quark occupation factors ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) .",
    "the latter is widely criticized due to the additional free parameters included in the statistical fits @xcite .",
    "the early one was also critically commented because of the absence of stringent test , especially with yields of light nuclei , in which no additional free parameter is available @xcite .",
    "the light nuclei are sensitive to the increasing in the powers of the quark chemical potentials . for sake of completeness , we highlight that the production of hypertritons , for instance , is in good agreement with the standard statistical hadronization picture .",
