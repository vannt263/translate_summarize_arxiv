    "at the macroscale , deterministic dynamics often emerges out of the random motion of the many subunits interacting in a complex system . in between the micro- and macroscales",
    ", the time evolution may admit a mesoscopic description in terms of stochastic processes in which the deterministic dynamics is affected by noise . in such systems ,",
    "the deterministic dynamics rules the mean fields or slow modes emerging out of the many rapidly fluctuating degrees of freedom . at the mesoscopic scale ,",
    "these latter can still manifest themselves and perturb the deterministic time evolution of the slow modes by fast additive or multiplicative noises @xcite .",
    "such stochastic processes have been considered for brownian motion @xcite , mesoscopic electric circuits @xcite and superconducting junctions @xcite , mesoscopic lasers and other optoelectronic devices @xcite , fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite , nucleation processes @xcite , reaction rate theory @xcite , nonequilibrium chemical kinetics @xcite , as well as collective behaviors such as synchronization , flocking or swarming in biology @xcite .",
    "the presence of noise may modify qualitatively the time evolution of systems .",
    "in particular , noise can activate the crossing of otherwise impenetrable barriers .",
    "therefore , states which are stable with respect to the deterministic dynamics may become metastable under the effect of noise , as it is the case in nucleation processes or chemical reactions @xcite . instead of remaining forever in a stable state ,",
    "the trajectory thus escapes from the metastable state with a rate , which corresponds to the lifetime of the system in the metastable state .",
    "the phenomenon of noise - induced escape is known in many systems including chemical reactions @xcite , nucleation processes @xcite , josephson tunnel junctions @xcite , semiconductor lasers @xcite , or systems with chaotic attractors or fractal basin boundaries @xcite .",
    "analytical methods have been developed to evaluate the lifetime of metastable states , especially , in the weak - noise limit . in this limit , the lifetime is often observed to grow exponentially with the inverse of the noise amplitude , a behavior which is reminiscent of arrhenius law in chemical kinetics . in microscopic chemical reactions , the noise is of thermal origin and its amplitude is controlled by the temperature so that the rate of hopping over the energy barrier is proportional to a boltzmann factor at the ambient temperature . in macroscopic complex systems ,",
    "the fluctuations come from the individual motions of the multiple active entities interacting in the system so that the noise amplitude is related to the size of the population of entities and has no thermal origin . in such complex systems ,",
    "the analogue of the activation energy is given by the action functional ruling the stochastic process in the weak - noise limit .",
    "if the noise is weak enough , a variational principle can be used to deduce a lagrangian or hamiltonian dynamical system from the action functional , as shown by onsager and machlup @xcite , freidlin and wentzell @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "remarkably , this dynamical system is deterministic and symplectic , i.e. , area - preserving in problems with one degree of freedom . in this respect , the method based on this hamiltonian dynamics is called the symplectic approach .",
    "we notice that this approach is similar to the semiclassical method of quantum mechanics in the limit where the mechanical action is much larger than planck s constant . as in quantum mechanics",
    ", the action functional plays a key role in the evaluation of various properties of interest @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "our purpose is to use the symplectic approach to calculate analytically the rate of noise - induced escape from attractors undergoing transcritical or pitchfork bifurcations @xcite .",
    "such bifurcations occur in dissipative deterministic systems controlled by tuning parameters .    at a transcritical bifurcation ,",
    "two steady state cross each other and exchange their stability . on both sides of the bifurcation",
    ", the unstable state may form the boundary with respect to a remote attractor . in this regard",
    ", this is a _",
    "boundary bifurcation_. in the presence of noise , this boundary can be crossed and trajectories may escape towards the remote attractor . near the bifurcation , the proximity of the boundary to the stable state can strongly enhance the escape rate in a way to be determined .    at a pitchfork bifurcation ,",
    "a stable state becomes unstable , leading to the emergence of a pair of stable states .",
    "therefore , the deterministic system becomes bistable with two attractors beyond the bifurcation .",
    "noise will induce random across the unstable state forming the boundary between both attractors . here also , the escape rate from each one of both attractors is deeply modified close to the bifurcation .",
    "as we show in the present paper , the symplectic approach allows us to evaluate the effects of these bifurcations on the lifetimes of the metastable states in the weak - noise limit . to investigate these effects , we consider one - dimensional maps with additive independent gaussian random variables at each time step . in the weak - noise limit ,",
    "we obtain a symplectic area - preserving map associated with the action functional of this gaussian stochastic process . near the bifurcation",
    ", we show that an appropriate rescaling of time transforms the two - dimensional symplectic map into a continuous - time hamiltonian system suitable for analytical calculations . in this way",
    ", the noise - induced escape rate can be evaluated analytically .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section [ nmap ]",
    ", we briefly present the escape problem for a general one - dimensional noisy map . in section",
    "[ pint ] , we detail the path integral formalism for such noisy systems .",
    "thereafter , we perform semiclassical calculation using the steepest - descent method in order to obtain the general expression of the aforementioned symplectic map .",
    "its phase portraits are analyzed for a specific example . with the help of this analysis",
    ", we introduce an analytical model in section [ amod ] which allows us to calculate an approximate but analytic expression for the analogue of the activation energy in our context . in section [ res ]",
    ", we present the results given by this model for several noisy maps and compare them with the results of monte - carlo simulations .",

    "consider a general one - dimensional map @xmath0 from the set @xmath1 of real numbers onto itself .",
    "such maps are models of the poincar recurrence in strongly dissipative systems .",

    "the trajectories of this system are no longer deterministic since the trajectories @xmath21 depends on the sequence of random variables @xmath22 besides the initial condition @xmath23 .",
    "one of the consequences is that the noise perturbs the stability of the attractors .",
    "the boundaries of the basin of attraction @xmath24 can be crossed and the trajectory may escape from attractors .",
