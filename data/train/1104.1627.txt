    "mapping the qcd phase diagram as a function of temperature @xmath0 and baryochemical potential @xmath1 is one of the fundamental goals of heavy - ion collision experiments .",
    "qcd critical point is a distinct singular feature of the phase diagram .",
    "it is a ubiquitous property of qcd models based on the chiral symmetry breaking dynamics ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite for a review and further references )",
    ". locating the point using first - principle lattice calculations is a formidable challenge ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite for a recent review and references ) .",
    "if the critical point is situated in the region accessible to heavy - ion collision experiments it can be discovered experimentally .",
    "the search for the critical point is planned at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at bnl , the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) at cern , the future facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) at gsi , and nuclotron - based ion collider facility ( nica ) in dubna ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the characteristic feature of a critical point is the divergence of the correlation length @xmath2 and of the magnitude of the fluctuations .",
    "the simplest measures of fluctuations in heavy - ion collisions are the variances of the event - by - event observables such as multiplicities or mean transverse momenta of particles .",
    "the singular , critical contribution to these variances diverges as ( approximately ) @xmath3 , and would manifest in a non - monotonic dependence of such measures as the critical point is passed by during the beam energy scan  @xcite . in realistic heavy ion collision the divergence of @xmath2 is cut - off by the effects of critical slowing down @xcite , and the estimates of the maximum correlation length are in the range of at most @xmath4 fm , compared to the natural @xmath5 fm away from the critical point .",
    "however , higher , non - gaussian , moments of the fluctuations depend much more sensitively on @xmath2 , according to  ref.@xcite .",
    "for example , the 4-th moment grows as @xmath6 near the critical point , making it an attractive experimental tool . in this paper",
    "we follow up on the results of ref.@xcite to point out that the sign of the 4-th moment could be negative as the critical point is approached from the crossover side of the qcd phase transition .",
    "the sign of various moments have been discussed in the literature in related contexts : see , e.g. , discussion of the sign of the 3-rd moment in  ref.@xcite or the 6-th and 8-th moments in  ref.@xcite and also numerical lattice calculations in ref.@xcite where the possible sign change of kurtosis is noted .    in this paper  we shall address specifically the sign of the 4-th moment ( or kurtosis ) and do it in a more universal and quantitative way than has been done previously , by using the known parametric form of the universal equation of state near the critical point .",
    "we emphasize universality of the behavior of the kurtosis and draw experimental consequences from these results .",
    "let us begin , as in ref.@xcite , by describing fluctuations of the order parameter field @xmath7 near a critical point using the probability distribution @xmath8 \\sim \\exp\\left\\ { - \\omega[\\sigma]/t\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the effective action ( free energy ) functional for the field @xmath10 , which can be expanded in powers of @xmath10 as well as in the gradients ( we chose @xmath11 at the minimum ) : @xmath12 \\,.\\ ] ] calculating 2-point correlator @xmath13 we find that the correlation length @xmath14 .",
    "for the moments of the zero momentum mode @xmath15 in a system of volume @xmath16 we find at tree level @xmath17\\ , { \\xi}^8\\ , .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 denotes the connected 4-th central moment ( the 4-th cumulant ) .",
    "the critical point is characterized by @xmath19 .",
    "the central observation in ref.@xcite was that the higher moments ( cumulants ) @xmath20 and @xmath21 diverge with @xmath22 much faster than the quadratic moment @xmath23 .",
    "here we shall point out that the _ sign _ of the 4-th moment @xmath21 is negative in a certain sector near the critical point .",
    "more precisely , the 4-th cumulant is negative when the critical point is approached from the crossover side .",
    "let us demonstrate this in several complementary ways .",
    "a simple way to see why the kurtosis is negative is by following the evolution of the probability distribution of @xmath24 as we approach the critical point along the crossover line . in ising scaling",
    "coordinates : along @xmath25 , @xmath26 ray .",
    "away from the critical point , more precisely for @xmath27 , the central limit theorem dictates that the probability distribution of @xmath24 is gaussian , with a vanishingly small kurtosis . as we approach the critical point the distribution develops non - gaussian shape .",
    "this intermediate shape is a deformation of the gaussian towards a two - peak distribution , corresponding to the phase coexistence on the opposite , first - order transition side ( @xmath28 ) of the critical point .",
    "such a shape is clearly less `` peaked '' than the gaussian , and thus corresponds to negative kurtosis .",
    "more quantitatively , the kurtosis vanishes as @xmath29 at ( almost ) any point away from the critical point , i.e. , @xmath30 the exception is the coexistence line ( @xmath25 , @xmath28 ray ) .",
    "the distribution there has two peaks of equal height and its kurtosis is @xmath31 .",
    ", at @xmath32 , the value of @xmath33 is independent of @xmath16 ( the correlation length @xmath34 is as large as it can be at given volume ) .",
    "this value of @xmath33 is a universal number ( it depends only on the boundary conditions for a given universality class ) and is well - known .",
    "it is usually expressed as the value of the binder cumulant @xmath35 , which means @xmath36 . ]",
    "it is important to note that this is only true strictly _ on _ the coexistence line @xmath25 , for the moments measured around the symmetric point of the probability distribution of @xmath24 , which is actually a dip , not a peak , for @xmath28 . at any point close to the coexistence line ,",
    "i.e. , at @xmath37 , @xmath28 , the kurtosis around the dominant peak is positive .    in the scaling regime ( close to , but not at the critical point ) where @xmath2 is much greater than the microscopic scale , @xmath38 , but still much less than the linear size of the system : @xmath39 , the coefficient of @xmath40 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k - def ] ) can be expressed in terms of the couplings @xmath41 using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - moments ] ) : @xmath42 these couplings , and in fact the shape of the effective potential , is also universal . in particular , @xmath43 scales with  @xmath2 as @xmath44 , where the universal value of @xmath45 is known approximately to be 4.0 on the crossover line ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    ", which is only of order few percent . ] since on the crossover line @xmath46 and @xmath47 , it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - moments ] ) that @xmath48 .",
    "away from the crossover line ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ray ) the distribution is skewed : @xmath49 .",
    "this makes the kurtosis positive , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : k - lambda ] ) , except for a certain sector around the crossover line .",
    "to extend this analysis away from the crossover line , i.e. , to take into account @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k - lambda ] ) , we need to know the equation of state , in particular , @xmath21 as a function of both ising variables : reduced temperature @xmath50 and magnetic field @xmath51 . in the scaling regime near @xmath52",
    "this equation of state is also universal . for the ising model",
    "it is known to order @xmath53 in the epsilon expansion as well as numerically .",
    "before we discuss this universal form , let us keep in mind that the mapping of qcd phase diagram in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 plane into @xmath50 , @xmath51 plane is not universal",
    ". however , this mapping is analytic , i.e. , both functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 are analytic at the critical point , which is mapped into the origin , @xmath56 .",
    "the standard parametrization , ref.@xcite , of the equation of state in the scaling domain near the critical point is in terms of two new scaling variables @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( it has been applied in the context of qcd before , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "denoting the `` magnetization '' by @xmath59 we define @xmath57 and @xmath58 as @xmath60 then the equation of state can be expressed in terms of the single function @xmath61 as @xmath62 unlike the explicit form of the singular equation of state @xmath63 , the function @xmath61 is analytic .",
    "it has two zeros .",
    "one , at @xmath64 , corresponds to the crossover line ( @xmath26 , @xmath25 ray ) , another , at some @xmath65 , corresponds to the coexistence ( first - order transition ) line ( @xmath28 , @xmath25 ray ) .",
    "the function @xmath61 must also be odd since @xmath66 .",
    "the simplest function obeying all these requirements is a cubic polynomial @xmath67 where the value @xmath68 is a good approximation to the universal value for the ising model ( and correct up to @xmath69 ) . the choice ( [ eq : h - cubic ] ) is known as the linear parametric model , ref.@xcite .",
    "it describes the equation of state with precision quite sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the linear parametric model is also known to be exact up to @xmath70 . using this parametric equation of state",
    ", we can calculate the moments by taking derivatives at fixed @xmath50 , up to an overall normalization , unimportant in the present context ( it can be fixed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - moments ] ) ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath71 for our purposes , it would be sufficient to use the approximate rational values of critical exponents @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which are within few percent of their exact values in three dimensions . the result of eq .",
    "( [ eq : k4-mh ] ) can then be simplified to @xmath74 we represent @xmath75 graphically as a density plot in fig .  [",
    "fig : k4-th ] .",
    "we see that the 4-th cumulant ( and kurtosis ) is negative in the sector bounded by two curved rays @xmath76 ( corresponding to @xmath77 ) .     and @xmath51 .",
    "]    also in fig .",
    "[ fig : k4-th ] we show the dependence of @xmath21 along a line which could be thought of as representing a possible mapping of the freezeout trajectory ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qcd - pd ] ) onto the @xmath78 plane .",
    "although the absolute value of the peak in @xmath21 depends on the proximity of the freezeout curve to the critical point , the ratio of the maximum to minimum along such an @xmath79 curve is a universal number , approximately equal to @xmath80 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : kappa4-theta - r ] ) .",
    "the negative minimum is small relative to the positive peak , but given the large size of the latter , ref.@xcite , the negative contribution to kurtosis may be significant .",
    "in addition , the mapping of the freezeout curve certainly need not be @xmath79 , and the relative size of the positive and negative peaks depends sensitively on that .    the trend described above appears to show in the recent lattice data , ref.@xcite , obtained using pade resummation of the truncated taylor expansion in @xmath1 . as the chemical potential",
    "is increased along the freezeout curve , the 4-th moment of the baryon number fluctuations begins to decrease , possibly turning negative , as the critical point is approached ( see fig.2 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "another observation , which we shall return to at the end of the next section , is that @xmath81 grows as we approach the crossover line , corresponding to @xmath25 , @xmath26 on the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : k4-dp ] . on the qcd phase diagram",
    "the freezeout point will move in this direction if one reduces the size of the colliding nuclei or selects more peripheral collisions ( the freezeout occurs earlier , i.e. , at higher @xmath0 , in a smaller system ) .",
    "in this section we wish to connect the results for the fluctuations of the order parameter field @xmath10 to the fluctuations of the observable quantities . as an example we consider the fluctuations of the multiplicity of given charged particles , such as pions or protons .    for completeness we shall briefly rederive the results of ref.@xcite using a simple model of fluctuations .",
    "the model captures the most singular term in the contribution of the critical point to the fluctuation observables .",
    "consider a given species of particle interacting with fluctuating critical mode field @xmath10 .",
    "the infinitesimal change of the field @xmath82 leads to a change of the effective mass of the particle by the amount @xmath83 .",
    "this could be considered a definition of the coupling @xmath84 .",
    "for example , the coupling of protons in the sigma model is @xmath85 .",
    "the fluctuations @xmath86 of the momentum space distribution function @xmath87 consist of the pure statistical fluctuations @xmath88 around the equilibrium distribution @xmath89 for a particle of a given mass , which itself fluctuates .",
    "this gives @xmath90 using this equation we can calculate the most singular contribution from the critical fluctuations to the moments or correlators of @xmath86 .",
    "the fluctuation of the multiplicity @xmath91 is given by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the degeneracy factor ( e.g. , number of spin or charge states of the particle ) .",
    "neglecting , for clarity and simplicity , the effects of quantum statistics , i.e. , assuming @xmath94 , we can use poisson statistics for @xmath95 .",
    "using additivity of the cumulants ( their defining property ) , and assuming @xmath95 and @xmath82 are uncorrelated , the contribution of the critical fluctuations can be expressed in terms of the corresponding moments of the critical field @xmath10 fluctuations .",
    "for example , the contribution to the 4-th moment can be expressed as ( cf .",
    "refs.@xcite ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the relativistic gamma - factor of a particle with momentum @xmath98 and mass  @xmath99 . the first term on the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eq : n4 ] ) is the poisson contribution .",
    "we neglected @xmath100 in the quantum statistics factor @xmath101 for simplicity , and we denoted by `` @xmath102 '' other contributions , less singular at the critical point .",
    "the model is admittedly crude , but it illustrates the mechanism and correctly captures the most singular contribution near the critical point .    in the region near the critical point where @xmath103 is negative , the 4-th cumulant of the fluctuations will be smaller than its poisson value , @xmath104 .",
    "the measure defined in ref.@xcite as @xmath105 will be less than 1 . by how much will depend sensitively on the correlation length ( as @xmath6 ) , i.e. , on how close the freezeout occurs to the critical point , as well as on other factors ( for protons , most significantly , on the value of @xmath1 . ) we shall not attempt to estimate this effect quantitatively in this paper .",
    "the analysis of ref.@xcite suggests , however , that this effect for protons can be significant compared to the poisson value already for @xmath106 fm .",
    "usual caveats apply : other ( non - trivial ) contributions to moments which do not behave singularly at the critical point can turn out to be relatively large .",
    "it is beyond the scope of the paper  to estimate these effects .",
    "the size of these background contributions could , in principle , be determined experimentally by performing measurements away from the critical point .",
    "we conclude by asking an obvious question : has the effect of the negative kurtosis been observed ? data from star indicate that at @xmath107 gev the ratio @xmath108 might be substantially smaller than its poisson value 1 , see fig .  6 in ref.@xcite , while it is very close to 1 at higher @xmath109 ( smaller  @xmath1 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the statistics accumulated in the short run at @xmath107 gev is clearly not sufficient to make a reliable conclusion . it would be interesting to see if this effect persists with more statistics at this energy .",
    "if confirmed , this result could indicate that the critical point is close , at somewhat larger values of @xmath1 ( smaller @xmath109 ) . in this case , as we already discussed at the end of the previous section , the universality would also predict that the negative kurtosis effect should increase in more peripheral collisions at the same @xmath109 . at smaller values of @xmath109",
    "the effect should change sign , increasing kurtosis above its poisson value .",
