    "small size , complex structure and extreme openness or complete absence of the cavity are characteristic features of a number of `` exotic '' laser systems that have attracted the attention of physicists in recent years @xcite",
    ". examples of lasers that fall into this category are chaotic microcavity @xcite and random @xcite lasers .",
    "these systems are quite different from `` traditional '' cavity lasers composed of an amplifying medium in a high quality - factor cavity @xcite . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the very strong coupling to the external world requires a special treatment that is different from what can be found in standard laser textbooks @xcite .",
    "a semiclassical model of lasing in open complex or random media was developed by treci _",
    "this theory was successfully applied to understand lasing in random media @xcite . to develop the quantum theory of an open - cavity laser ,",
    "one starts by facing the problem of quantization of the electromagnetic field in a space that can not be separated into `` system '' and `` bath '' parts unambiguously .",
    "this problem was solved by hackenbroich _",
    "@xcite who also put forward langevin and master equations to describe the dynamics of modes in open resonators @xcite .",
    "hackenbroich also derived heisenberg - langevin equations for an open - cavity laser , which , however , he analyzed only in the semiclassical approximation @xcite . a related problem of light emission by an atom in a lossy cavity was also considered by di fidio _",
    "@xcite who , however , considered a single - mode field and hence did nt discuss additional features that arise from the coupling between modes due to the openness of the system .",
    "in the present paper we use a combination of the quantization procedure of refs .",
    "@xcite with the standard density operator approach @xcite to develop the full quantum theory of an open - cavity laser .",
    "we compute and analyze the lasing threshold , the photon statistics ( both below and above the threshold ) , as well as the emission linewidth of a laser that has no well - defined cavity , assuming that only two modes compete for gain .",
    "this simple two - mode model allows us to capture some of the essential features of cooperative mode dynamics that seems to determine the behavior of the system .",
    "we compare our results with those known from the standard laser theory @xcite and highlight common features as well as important differences .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that a different master equation for a random laser was previously proposed by florescu and john @xcite .",
    "these authors considered the random laser as a collection of low quality - factor cavities , coupled by random photon diffusion .",
    "in contrast to this work , our approach has the advantage of not relying on any particular model of wave transport , as well as being based on a well - defined quantization procedure for the electromagnetic field and a fully quantum model for the atoms providing amplification .",
    "let us start by considering an ensemble of two - level atoms interacting with the electromagnetic field .",
    "we divide the modes of the electromagnetic field into those that belong to the system `` atoms + field '' ( a + f ) and those that constitute the `` bath '' . in the density operator approach ,",
    "the system a + f is described by the density operator @xmath0 . the reduced density operator @xmath1 describing the electromagnetic field ( f ) is obtained by tracing over the atomic ( a ) degrees of freedom : @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics of the laser is due to the competition between gain ( due to the interaction of the field with atoms ) and loss ( due to the coupling of the system a + f to the bath ) , which can be expressed in the form of the following master equation : @xmath3 here the super - operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 describe the gain and the loss , respectively",

    "it is natural to choose the first subspace such that it contains all the atoms and has a finite volume .",
    "the discrete modes of the first subspace will constitute our sub - system f , whereas the modes of the second subspace will make up the bath .",
    "an equation for the density matrix of the sub - system f is derived by tracing over the degrees of freedom corresponding to the modes that belong to the bath .",
    "this yields @xcite @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are annihilation and creation operators corresponding to the modes of the sub - system f , and the coefficients @xmath13 depend on the precise geometry of the system .",
    "these coefficients were calculated for a number of particular open cavities in ref .",
    "@xcite but may be difficult to obtain in the general case . in a random laser system , they may be treated as random variables @xcite .    the essential difference between eq .",
    "( [ eq : losses rho ] ) and the analogous equation of the standard laser theory @xcite is that the damping matrix @xmath14 is not diagonal .",
    "this shows that the openness of the system not only leads to losses described by the diagonal elements of @xmath14 , but also induces coupling between different modes .",
    "the strength of the coupling is given by the off - diagonal elements of the damping matrix @xmath14 .",

    "the inset shows the dependence of the linewidth on @xmath178 for @xmath196 .",
    "[ linewidth],scaledwidth=90.0% ]    as in the usual single - mode laser with a cavity of high quality factor @xcite , the finite linewidth of our two - mode open - cavity laser is due to the spontaneous emission of the active atoms .",
    "previous studies have shown that in an open cavity , the emission line is further broadened by a factor @xmath68 , called the petermann factor @xcite , due to the nonorthogonality of the cavity modes @xcite . however , our analysis here is based on the quantization procedure of refs .",
    "@xcite that relies on the expansion of the electromagnetic field inside and outside of the cavity in terms of orthogonal modes .",
    "it is therefore interesting to check if our model reproduces the large petermann factor expected from previous studies @xcite .",

    "[ kfactor ] where @xmath68 is shown as a function of @xmath79 far above threshold .",

    "we developed the quantum theory of a laser with an open cavity .",
    "the openness of the cavity is mathematically described by a nondiagonal damping matrix @xmath14 . assuming that only two modes of the `` cold '' cavity are allowed to participate in the competition for gain",
    ", we have shown that the modes strongly interact with each other and that a composite mode ( denoted by @xmath93 here ) is built up .",
    "this composite mode shows all the properties of a typical laser mode : threshold behavior , photon statistics evolving from thermal to poissonian as the pumping rate increases , augmented photon number fluctuations in the vicinity of the threshold , and linewidth narrowing . at the same time",
    ", the precise behavior of the composite mode @xmath93 at given values of parameters depends explicitly on the off - diagonal element @xmath79 of the damping matrix @xmath14 .",
    "more precisely , an increase of @xmath79 rises the lasing threshold and broadens the laser emission line .",
    "an important result that can not be obtained from a semi - classical theory and needs the quantum theory developed in this paper to be understood is the broadening of the emission linewidth due to the coupling of the cavity modes through a common bath ( fig .",
    "[ kfactor ] ) .",
    "this broadening should be accessible experimentally : indeed , measurements of the laser linewidth in a laser with two coupled modes were already performed in , e.g. , ref .",
    "it is interesting to note that in that work the mechanism of coupling was different and led to narrowing of the emission linewidth due to the so - called correlated spontaneous emission in a system of two excited levels that provide inversion for lasing on transitions sharing a common lower level ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the theoretical model ) .",
    "in contrast to this , the two - mode open - cavity laser considered in this paper exhibits widening of the emission linewidth .",
    "this would certainly limit applications of such a laser for high - precision measurements but might be beneficial for other applications where low - coherence light is required ( like , e.g. , optical coherence tomography @xcite ) .",
    "one of the possible applications of our theory may lie in the field of random lasers . in this case , the damping matrix @xmath14 should be treated as a random matrix and our results should be averaged over the statistical distribution of its elements .",
    "however , to obtain results that can be directly applied to random laser systems , one has to generalize our analysis to the multi - mode case because the number of active modes in random lasers is expected to be large @xcite ."
