    "@xmath0 is a nearby ( distance to the earth @xmath3 ) young main - sequence ( ms ) star ( age @xmath4 ) of spectral type a0v ( effective temperature @xmath5 ) .",
    "the @xmath0 dust disk has recently aroused considerable interest because ( 1 ) it has the largest fractional infrared ( ir ) luminosity relative to the total stellar luminosity ( @xmath6 ; @xmath7 ) among the @xmath8 a - type ms stars in the _ bright star catalogue _ ( jura 1991 ) ; ( 2 ) unlike the majority of circumstellar disks , the @xmath0 disk displays a ring - like structure peaking at @xmath9 from the central star and abruptly truncated both interior and outside with a width of @xmath10 ( schneider et al .",
    "1999 ) ; ( 3 ) its young - age nature places it at a somewhat transitional stage between massive gaseous protostellar disks around young pre - ms t - tauri and herbig ae / be stars ( @xmath11 ) and much evolved and tenuous debris disks around ms `` vega - type '' stars ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the physical and chemical properties of the dust in the @xmath0 disk , which play a significant role in understanding the creation , dynamical evolution and structural properties of the disk , are poorly constrained : ( 1 ) based on the lifetime of dust against loss by poynting - robertson drag , jura et al .",
    "( 1993 ) suggested that the @xmath0 dust is larger than @xmath13 in radius and the dust is a remnant of the protostellar nebula ; ( 2 ) from an analysis of radiation pressure vs. gravitational attraction , jura et al .",
    "( 1995 ) found that the minimum radius of grains orbiting @xmath0 is about @xmath14 and argued that these grains have undergone measurable coalescence ; ( 3 ) in order to explain the @xmath15 inner hole ( jura et al .",
    "1995 ) and the @xmath16 black - body approximation for the 10100@xmath2 dust emission , jura et al .",
    "( 1998 ) proposed that the @xmath0 grains are largely composed of ice particles with a typical radius of @xmath17 which originate from a protocometary cloud ; ( 4 ) in order to explain the entire 12.5@xmath2 emission and the 20.8@xmath2 residual emission unaccounted for by their simple model , koerner et al .",
    "( 1998 ) proposed the existence of a tenuous dust component at a distance of 36@xmath18 from the star which is heated to about 200300@xmath19 , similar to the zodiacal dust in our own solar system ; ( 5 ) from the red reflectance of the disk , schneider et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argued that the mean dust size must be larger than several microns and the dust is circumstellar debris rather than interstellar in origin ; ( 6 ) based on a detailed modelling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the @xmath0 disk , augereau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) proposed a two - component model consisting of a cold annulus peaking at @xmath20 from the star ( made of interstellar dust - type grains ranging from @xmath13 to a few meters ) and a hot population at 910@xmath18 from the star ( made of comet - like grains of radii @xmath21 ) ; ( 7 ) using the flux ratio at 10.8@xmath2 and 18.2@xmath2 and assuming `` astronomical silicates '' , telesco et al .",
    "( 2000 ) inferred a `` characteristic '' diameter of @xmath22 and argued that these grains are unlikely to be primordial ; instead , they are probably products of recent collisions of large bodies .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to constrain the dust properties ( size , composition , and morphology ) of the @xmath0 disk . in general , in a dusty system , dust spatial distribution and dust sizes can not be uniquely determined by the sed _ alone_. given that the distribution of the dust in the @xmath0 disk is well constrained by the near - ir imaging of scattered starlight ( schneider et al .",
    "1999 ) and , to a less degree , by the mid - ir imaging of dust thermal emission ( jayawardhana et al .  1998 ; koerner et al .  1998 ; telesco et al .",
    "2000 ) , an attempt is therefore made in this work to infer the @xmath0 dust properties by modelling the full spectral energy distribution from the mid - ir to the submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "lacking a priori knowledge of the composition of the dust in the @xmath0 disk , we consider two extreme dust types : ( 1 ) `` cold - coagulation '' dust  dust in protoplanetary disks is formed through cold aggregation of unaltered interstellar materials  this is the case in the outer parts of the disk where interstellar dust originating from the parent molecular cloud ( out of which the disk forms ) is not likely to have significantly changed its composition during passage through the weak shock front when the disk is first created , except volatile ice mantles around the refractory cores may partly sublimate , but the recondensation of volatiles occurs efficiently behind the shock ( see beckwith , henning , & nakagawa 2000 for a review ) ; ( 2 ) `` hot - nebula '' dust  dust has undergone significant destruction and modification in protoplanetary accretion disks through annealing of amorphous silicates and oxidation of carbonaceous dust in the warm inner regions of the accretion disk ( gail 2001 ) ; turbulent radial mixing ( gail 2001 ) and/or outflows driven by `` x - winds '' ( shu , shang , & lee 1996 ) then carries these heavily processed dust into cold regions of the disk where it is mixed with freshly accreted material from the parent molecular cloud ; as an extreme , we consider a dust model in which the carbonaceous dust component has been fully destroyed by oxidation so that only crystalline silicate dust remains . in reality",
    ", the dust in protoplanetary disks would undoubtedly be intermediate between heavily processed dust and aggregates of unaltered interstellar dust .",
    "since planetesimals and cometesimals are formed by coagulation of such dust aggregates , the dust generated by collisions of planetesimals and cometesimals should resemble the original dust from which they are built up .",
    "we first discuss in  [ sec : method ] the general constraints on the @xmath0 dust and disk properties .",
    "we then model the observed sed in  [ sec : cold ] and  [ sec : hot ] in terms of the `` cold - aggregation '' model of unaltered interstellar dust and the `` hot - nebula '' model with all amorphous silicate dust annealed and all carbonaceous dust oxidized , respectively .",
    "we find that , for both models , ( 1 ) highly porous grains with a porosity @xmath23 provide excellent fits to the entire sed ; ( 2 ) there appears to be no need for a hot `` zodiacal cloud '' dust component (  [ sec : zodi ] ) which was previously suggested by koerner et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and augereau et al .",
    "therefore , the presence of either type of particles in the disk is possible .",
    "we show in  [ sec : pwl ] that , although good fits to the sed can be achieved by models with a single power - law dust spatial distribution , they are apparently in conflict with the imaging observations of scattered starlight and dust thermal emission . in  [ sec : sirtf ] we calculate the dust ir intensities integrated over the sirtf / irac and mips bands predicted for our best - fitting models .",
    "the major conclusions are summarized in  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "a grain in the optically thin dust disk of @xmath0 absorbs stellar ultraviolet / optical photons and then re - radiates the energy in the ir . to calculate the disk s emission spectrum , knowledge of its morphology , composition , and size",
    "is required .",
    "a fluffy structure is expected for dust in protoplanetary disks as a result of its coagulational growth process .",
    "we characterize its fluffiness by porosity @xmath24 , the fractional volume of vacuum .",
    "we assume all grains are spherical in shape .    in  [ sec : composition ]",
    "we estimate that the `` cold - coagulation '' model leads to porous dust consisting of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous materials ( and h@xmath25o - dominated ices in regions colder than @xmath26 ) with a mixing ratio of @xmath27 [ and @xmath28 for cold regions ] . for the `` hot - nebula '' dust model , we assume that the dust is exclusively composed of crystalline silicate dust ( and ices in cold regions ) .    we assume a power law dust size distribution @xmath29 which is characterized by a lower - cutoff @xmath30 , upper - cutoff @xmath31 and power - law index @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the spherical radius ) .",
    "we take @xmath34 , the smallest value among previous estimations of @xmath30 ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) ; with a porosity of @xmath35 consists of @xmath36 constituent individual ( interstellar ) particles which have a typical size of @xmath37 ( see li & greenberg 1997 ) .",
    "models with a smaller @xmath30 ( @xmath38 ) and a larger @xmath30 ( @xmath39 ) will be discussed in  [ sec : pwl ] ] and @xmath40 ( this is not a critical parameter since grains larger than @xmath17 are like blackbodies and their ir emission spectra are size - insensitive ) .",
    "the dust spatial distribution is well constrained by the near - ir imaging of scattered starlight ( schneider et al .",
    "1999 ) to be a sharply - truncated ring - like structure peaking at a radial distance of @xmath9 from the star with a characteristic width of @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we adopt a gaussian function for the dust spatial density distribution:$ ] where the vertical scale height @xmath41 is @xmath42 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath41 can be determined from the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium assumption ( @xmath43 ; see appendix b in li & lunine 2003 ) .",
    "but the knowledge of the dust vertical distribution is not required and it does not affect our results since in modelling the sed of the @xmath0 disk , what actually involves is the dust surface density distribution @xmath44 . ]",
    "@xmath45 $ ] which is characterized by the radial position @xmath46 where @xmath47 peaks and the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath48 .",
    "the dust surface density distribution obtained by integrating @xmath49 over the perpendicular ( to the disk plane ) path lengths can be expressed as @xmath50 $ ] where @xmath51 is the mid - plane ( @xmath52 ) surface density at @xmath53 .",
    "this distribution function , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , was successful in modelling the scattered - light images ( kenyon et al .",
    "a gaussian - type dust distribution was also adopted by klahr & lin ( 2000 ) to model the dynamics of the dust ring around @xmath0 .",
    "we fix @xmath46 to be at @xmath54 and take @xmath56 , the mean value of the determinations of schneider et al .",
    "( 1999 ; @xmath57 ) and kenyon et al .",
    "( 1999 ; @xmath55 ) .",
    "the inner boundary @xmath58 is set to be where grains are heated to @xmath59 , and hence , @xmath58 is a function of dust size . for micron - sized grains ,",
    "the inner boundary is roughly @xmath60 .",
    "the outer boundary is taken to be @xmath61 which is expected from the disk truncation caused by the tidal effects of @xmath62 , a companion star of @xmath0 ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "therefore , we are only left with two free parameters : ( 1 ) the dust porosity @xmath24 , and ( 2 ) the dust size distribution power index @xmath32 .",
    "dielectric functions are taken from ( 1 ) draine & lee ( 1984 ) for amorphous silicate dust ; ( 2 ) li & draine ( 2001a ) for crystalline silicate dust ; ( 3 ) li & greenberg ( 1997 ) for carbonaceous dust ; ( 4 ) li & greenberg ( 1998 ) for h@xmath25o - dominated ice .",
    "the bruggman effective medium theory ( bohren & huffman 1983 ) is used to calculate the mean dielectric functions for the fluffy heterogeneous dust aggregates .",
    "absorption cross sections are obtained using mie theory .",
    "approximating the @xmath0 radiation field by the kurucz model atmosphere spectrum for a0v stars ( kurucz 1979 ) , dust equilibrium temperatures are then derived by balancing absorption and emission . for a given dust size distribution and a given disk structure ( dust spatial density distribution ) ,",
    "the emergent ir emission spectrum can be obtained by integrating over the dust size range , and over the entire disk . the calculated ir spectrum",
    "is then compared with the available photometric data for the @xmath0 disk compiled by augereau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "we first model the @xmath0 sed in terms of the dust generated from collisions of planetesimals and cometesimals formed in the disk ( see  [ sec : rppr ] ) through cold - coagulation of unaltered interstellar grains from its parent molecular cloud . using the dust composition discussed in ",
    "[ sec : composition ] , we calculate the model ir spectra for a wide range of dust porosities @xmath24 and a wide range of dust size distribution power - indices @xmath32 to search for good fits . we note that @xmath24 refers to the porosity of refractory dust ",
    "@xmath24 will be reduced to @xmath63 for dust with ices ( see  [ sec : porosity ] ) .",
    "we illustrate in figure [ fig : cold ] the best fits obtained for dust with a porosity of @xmath64 .",
    "model parameters and results are tabulated in table [ tab : para ] .",
    "it is seen that the best fit is provided by dust with @xmath65 ( with a total mass of @xmath66 ; model no.2 )  dust more porous than this is somewhat too hot so that its emission is deficient in the submillimeter wavelength range ( see figure [ fig : cold]a ) ; on the other hand , dust more compact than this is a bit too cold so that it produces too much emission in this wavelength range ( see figure [ fig : cold]b ) .",
    "now we consider another extreme case : dust in the inner disk regions has been so heavily processed that all amorphous silicate dust has been annealed ( @xmath67 ) and all carbonaceous dust has been oxidized ( @xmath68 ) by reacting with oh . the annealed silicate dust is then transported to ( or the silicate vapour recondenses in crystalline form in ) the cold outer regions of the disk where these grains grow into fluffy aggregates and are ultimately built into planetesimals / cometesimals .",
    "apparently , only a fraction of the dust in the disk is accreted to the inner warm regions and , hence , only a fraction of the silicate dust is crystalline .",
    "but since we are considering an `` extreme '' case , in this section we model the `` hot - nebula '' dust as porous aggregates of _ pure _ crystalline silicate dust ( plus ices in cold regions where dust reaches a temperature of @xmath26 ) .",
    "we do not know how much ice would recondense on the silicate core seeds in the fluffy aggregate , but the assumption of full condensation of all condensible volatile elements ( c , o , n ) as ices ( see  [ sec : composition ] ) seems to be at the highest end . as a complement to  [ sec : cold ] where full condensation is assumed , we take @xmath69 , a plausible value for dense molecular clouds .    again , model ir spectra are calculated for a wide range of dust porosities @xmath24 and a wide range of dust power - indices @xmath32 .",
    "except the sharp features at 11.3@xmath2 and 23@xmath2 , the `` hot - nebula '' model spectra are very similar to those of the `` cold - coagulation '' model . for illustration",
    ", we show in figure [ fig : hot ] the best - fit model spectra provided by dust with @xmath64 .",
    "model parameters and results are also tabulated in table [ tab : para ] .",

    "we have modelled the mid - infrared to submillimeter spectral energy distribution of the ring - like dust disk around the dustiest @xmath71-old a - type star @xmath0 .",
    "we start with two extreme dust types : one formed through cold - coagulation of unaltered protostellar interstellar grains , and one formed through aggregation of grains highly - processed in the protostellar nebula with silicate dust annealed and carbon dust oxidized .",
    "we adopt a gaussian - type dust spatial distribution with a peak at @xmath20 from the central star and a fwhm of @xmath72 as inferred from images of scattered light and dust thermal emission .",

    "our principal results are :    1 .",
    "it is shown that both types of dust are successful in reproducing the observed sed , provided that the dust generated by collisions of planetesimals and cometesimals is highly fluffy , with a vacuum volume fraction of @xmath1 (  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "the fact that the dust in the @xmath0 disk must be somewhere intermediate between these two types implies that our models are robust .",

    "<S> we model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from the mid - infrared to submillimeter of the ring - like disk of @xmath0 , the dustiest a - type star . </S>",
    "<S> we consider dust made either of coagulated but otherwise unaltered protostellar interstellar grains , or grains that are highly - processed in a protostellar / protoplanetary nebula with silicate dust annealed and carbon dust oxidized . </S>",
    "<S> both types of dust are successful in reproducing the observed sed , provided that the grains are highly fluffy , with a vacuum volume fraction of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find no evidence for the existence of a hot `` zodiacal dust '' component a few au from the star , which was suggested by previous workers to account for the 10@xmath2-wavelength emission . </S>"
