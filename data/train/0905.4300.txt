    "ngc7538irs1 was first detected in the radio at 5 ghz by @xcite , who found three compact radio sources at the se edge of the large ( @xmath3 4 ) region ngc7538 , which is at a distance 2.65 kpc @xcite .",
    "the brightest of the three , source b , has later become known as irs1 @xcite .",
    "the far - infrared luminosity of the three sources is @xmath31.9 10@xmath7 , completely dominated by irs1@xcite .",
    "irs1 was first resolved with the vla at 14.9 ghz by @xcite , who showed that it has a compact ( @xmath302 ) bipolar n - s core with faint extended fan - shaped lobes , suggesting an ionized outflow .",
    "this is an extremely well - studied source with numerous masers , a prominent molecular outflow and extremely broad hydrogen recombination lines indicating substantial mass motion of the ionized gas @xcite .",
    "although it has been modeled as an ionized jet @xcite or a photo - ionized accretion disk @xcite , the source is usually referred to as an ultra compact or hyper compact region with a turnover at @xmath3 100 ghz . since we have carried extensive observations of irs1 with bima and carma , the desire to determine the contribution from dust emission at mm - wavelengths led us to investigate where the free - free emission from irs1 becomes optically thin .",
    "such a determination is not possible from published data , because irs1 has been observed with a variety of vla configurations , some of which resolve out the extended emission and others may only quote total flux .",
    "this prevented us from separately estimating the flux for the compact bipolar core and the extended lobes .",
    "furthermore the flux density varies with time @xcite , which makes it difficult to derive an accurate spectral index .",
    "we have retrieved and re - analyzed a few key observations of ngc7538irs1 from the vla data archive . these are all long integration observations with very high angular resolution , good uv - coverage , and high image fidelity .",
    "table [ tbl-1 ] gives the observing dates , synthesized beam width , sensitivity , the integrated flux of the bipolar core , and the observed total flux .",
    "we included a bna array observation obtained by us at x - band ( 8.5 ghz)@xcite , because it is more contemporary with the high frequency data sets and provides an additional data point at a frequency where there are no other high angular resolution vla data available .",
    "fig [ fig - irs1 - 3 ] shows the irs1 - 3 field at 4.8 ghz , while fig [ fig - vla ] shows the morphology of the compact bipolar core as a function of frequency .",
    "we determined flux densities of the compact bipolar core with an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "the results are given in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "table [ tbl-1 ] also gives total flux densities , obtained by integrating over the whole area where we detect emission from irs1 . at 4.9 ghz",
    "the total linear extent of irs1 is @xmath3 7 , while it is @xmath3 14 at 43.4 ghz .",
    "even though we can reliably determine the flux density of the bipolar core at 43.4 ghz , some of the faint extended emission is filtered out ; therefore the total flux is underestimated . at 4.9 ghz",
    "the bipolar core has a total length of @xmath3 11 fwhm ( full width half maximum ) , with a separation between the two peaks of 068 , at 14.9 ghz the size is 044 with a peak separation of 024 ( table [ tbl-1 ] ) .",
    "at 43.4 ghz we can still fit the core with a double gaussian with a peak separation of @xmath3 012 , while the linear size ( length ) has a fwhm of 020 .",
    "since one of our data sets ( x - band , 8.4 ghz ) has insufficient resolution to resolve the two bipolar cores , we plot the linear size ( length ) as a function of wavelength in fig . [ fig - jet ] , although fitting to the lobe separation gives virtually identical results , but with a larger uncertainty .",
    "we find the size to vary with frequency as @xmath8 , while the flux density increases with frequency as @xmath9 .",
    "the frequency dependence of the total flux is more difficult to estimate , since some vla configurations are not very sensitive to faint extended emission and will therefore underestimate the total flux .",
    "if we chose data sets which give a reliable flux for irs2 , which is a spherical region with a size of @xmath3 8 , we find that the total flux from irs1 has a slightly steeper spectral index , 0.8 @xmath10 0.03 determined from data sets from 4.8 ghz to 49 ghz .",
    "the fit to the total flux densities for irs1 is shown as a dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig - jet ] .",
    "such a shallow frequency dependence would require a very steep density gradient in the ionized gas , if the emission originates from an region ionized by a central o - star , although it is not impossible , see e.g. @xcite . a high - density region with a steep density gradient should be spherical , not bipolar with a dark central lane as we observe in irs1 .",
    "neither can a steep density gradient model explain the extremely broad recombination lines observed in irs1 @xcite .",
    "all these characteristics can be explained , if the emission originates in an ionized stellar wind or jet @xcite .",
    "the inner part of the jet is optically thick and further out , where the jet expands , the emission becomes optically thin . at higher frequencies",
    "the outer part of the jet becomes optically thin and therefore appears shorter and more collimated , exactly what we see in irs1 , see fig [ fig - vla ] .",
    "for a uniformly expanding spherical wind , the size of the source varies as a function of frequency as @xmath11 , while the flux density density goes as @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "since we resolve the emission from irs1 , we know that it is not spherical , but instead it appears to originate in an initially collimated bipolar jet ( opening angle @xmath13 30 ) approximately aligned with the molecular outflow from irs1 , see section  [ accretion ] . for",
    "a collimated ionized jet , @xcite showed that it can have a spectral index anywhere between 2 and @xmath140.1 , depending on gradients in jet width , velocity , degree of ionization , and temperature .",

    "although the molecular outflow from irs1 in early studies was found to be quite compact and going from se to nw @xcite , we find that the molecular outflow is very extended ( @xmath17 4 ) and approximately aligned with the free - free jet from analyzing large mosaics obtained with carma in @xmath18co and @xmath19co j = @xmath20 , and hco@xmath4 j = @xmath20 . for hco@xmath4 we filled in missing zero spacing with fully sampled single dish maps obtained with fcrao .",
    "a thorough discussion of the molecular outflow is beyond the scope of this paper , and will be discussed in a forthcoming paper ( corder et al .",
    "2009 , in prep ) . here",
    "we therefore summarize some of the main results .",
    "the carma mosaics show that the outflow is very large and has a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath3 @xmath1420 , which is similar to the orientation of the collimated inner part of the ionized jet driven by irs1 on smaller angular scales .",
    "the outflow extends several arcminutes to the north and starts as a wide angle limb brightened flow . to the south",
    "the outflow is difficult to trace , because of several other outflows in the giant molecular core in which irs1 is embedded , but appears more collimated with a linear extent of @xmath3 2 .",
    "analysis of spitzer irac archive data show that the outflow may be even larger to the south .",
    "the 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath21 m irac images show a jet - like feature projecting back towards irs1 , extending to @xmath3 3.5  ( 2.6 pc ) from irs1 , which is much further out than what was covered by the carma mosaics @xcite .",
    "however , the carma observations also confirm that irs1 is still heavily accreting . in hco@xmath4",
    "j = @xmath20 we observe a clear inverse p cygni profile towards the strong continuum emission from irs1 ( fig [ fig - ipc ] ) .",
    "the absorption is all red - shifted and has two velocity components , which could mean that the accretion activity is varying with time ( episodic ) . from these data",
    "@xcite estimates @xmath3 6.8  of infalling gas . with the assumption that the accretion time is similar to the free - fall time , @xmath3 30,000 yr",
    ", @xcite finds an accretion rate @xmath3 2 10@xmath6 m@xmath22/yr , which will block most of the uv photons from the central o - star , allowing them to escape only at the polar regions .",
    "in fig . [ fig - jet ] we also plotted flux densities at 3 and 1  mm from the literature @xcite , supplemented with our own results at 3  mm from bima ( wright et al .",
    "2009 , in prep ) and carma @xcite .",
    "all the observed flux densities at 3  mm or even at 1.3  mm can be explained by free - free emission , with at most a marginal excess from dust emission .",
    "high angular resolution carma continuum observations at 91.4 and 108.1 ghz confirm what is predicted from the fit to total flux densities in fig  [ fig - jet ] , i.e. that the free - free emission dominates at 3  mm .",
    "these carma observations resolve irs1 with a size of 05 @xmath2303 pa @xmath141  and 04 @xmath2301 pa 20  at 94 and 109 ghz , respectively , i.e. the 3  mm emission is aligned with the free - free emission , and not with an accretion disk , which is expected to be perpendicular to the jet . since we detect a collimated free - free jet and since there is a strong accretion flow towards irs1 ( section [ accretion ] ) , irs1 must be surrounded by an accretion disk .",
    "the morphology of the free - free emission suggests that the disk should be almost edge - on , and centered halfway between the northern and the southern peak of the optically thick inner part of the free - free jet .",
    "however , if such an edge - on accretion disk is thin , i.e. the height of the disk is small relative to its diameter , it may not provide much surface area , and is therefore difficult to detect at 3  mm . at 3  mm irs1 and irs2",
    "are very strong in the free - free , and even the free - free emission from irs3 can not be ignored , which makes it very hard to detect dust emission from the accretion disk .",
    "since the spectral index for dust is @xmath3 3 - 3.5 , the dust emission may start to dominate at frequencies above 300 ghz , observable only by sma , but even at 1.3  mm we may have a much better chance to detect the accretion disk .",
    "there is some evidence for such a disk in 450 and 350 @xmath21 m continuum images obtained at jcmt @xcite .",
    "until higher spatial resolution interferometer images are available , it is not clear whether this emission originates in a disk , from the surrounding in - falling envelope , or from a superposition of several nearby sources .",
    "free - free emission from ionized jets is very common in low mass protostars ( class 0 and class i sources ) , which all appear to drive molecular outflows .",
    "this situation is especially true for young stars , which often have rather well collimated outflows @xcite",
    ". jets may also be common in young early b - type high mass stars @xcite , although they have not been studied as well as low - mass protostars , because they are short lived , more distant and harder to identify .",
    "although there have not been any detections of jets in young o stars , i.e. stars with a luminosity of @xmath17 10@xmath7 , such objects are likely to exist .",
    "broad radio recombination line ( rrl ) objects , many of which are classified as ultra compact or hyper compact regions @xcite offer a logical starting point , because they show evidence for substantial mass motions , which would be readily explained if the recombination line emission originates in a jet .",
    "several of them also show evidence for accretion . in the sample analyzed by @xcite , which partly overlaps with the sources discussed by @xcite , they find four sources ( including irs1 ) with bipolar morphology .",
    "all appear to be dominated by wind ionized emission , although not necessarily jet driven winds .",
    "k3 - 50a , however , at a distance of 8.7 kpc @xcite , has a luminosity of a mid - o star , drives an ionized bipolar outflow @xcite , and has a spectral index of 0.5 in the the frequency range 5 - 15 ghz @xcite .",
    "k3 - 50a is therefore another example of an o - star , where the free - free emission appears to be coming from an ionized jet",
    ". detailed studies of broad rrl objects will undoubtedly discover more examples of jet - ionized regions .",
    "such objects are likely to drive molecular outflows , excite masers and show evidence for strong accretion .    to summarize : we have shown that the emission from irs1 is completely dominated by a collimated ionized jet .",
    "the jet scenario also readily explains why the free - free emission is variable , because the accretion rate from the surrounding clumpy molecular cloud will vary with time",
    ". it also explains why irs1 is an extreme broad rrl object",
    ". since most hyper compact regions are broad rrl objects , and show rising free - free emission with similar spectral index to irs1 , other sources now classified as hyper compact regions , may also be similar to irs1 .",
