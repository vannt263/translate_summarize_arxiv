    "the five - dimensional warped models of randall and sundrum @xcite can be thought of as stripped down effective field theory approximations to the near horizon geometry @xcite of a stack of @xmath9 parallel @xmath1 branes in type iib string theory .",
    "this near horizon geometry is @xmath10 , where the anti - de sitter radius @xmath11 and the radius of the sphere are equal , scaling like @xmath12 .",
    "thus for large @xmath9 the @xmath8 physics involves an energy scale that is parametrically lower than the string ( or planck ) scale .",
    "so does the physics on @xmath13 , but we also expect this physics to be drastically altered as one breaks supersymmetry , and otherwise attempt to make the compactification more realistic .",
    "since in any event the sphere @xmath13 is not warped , in seems reasonable to factor out this physics and examine low energy effective 5d field theory on @xmath0 . in the randall - sundrum ( rs )",
    "approach , a phenomenological 3-brane called the planck brane is added to truncate @xmath0 in a way that excludes the @xmath8 boundary . from the point of view of string theory , this is a boundary condition that replaces the original matching of the near horizon geometry to @xmath14 ; in the @xmath15 dual language , the planck brane is a particular choice of uv cutoff for the 4d @xmath16 coupled to 4d gravity . the first randall - sundrum model ( rs1 )",
    "also introduces a second brane , called the tev brane .",
    "this brane truncates the @xmath8 geometry in the other direction , excluding now the @xmath8 horizon .",
    "this is a wise idea for a low energy effective field theory approach , since close to the horizon the field theory cutoff necessarily shrinks to zero and stringy effects become important .    in this paper",
    "we examine an analogous story which starts with eleven dimensional @xmath3 theory .",
    "the low energy supergravity theory has a solution @xcite corresponding to a stack of @xmath9 parallel @xmath4 branes .",
    "these @xmath4 branes are just the magnetic sources for the antisymmetric tensor gauge field @xmath17 of 11d supergravity , which also has electric sources called @xmath18 branes .",
    "we extract the near horizon geometry of this solution for ( moderately ) large @xmath9 .",
    "this geometry is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the planck length , in the convention where the @xmath18 branes have inverse tension @xmath22 .",
    "as motivated above we will discard the unwarped sphere @xmath23 and consider low energy effective 7d field theories built on @xmath2 : @xmath24 where we have introduced the warp factor @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "our metric signature convention is @xmath27 . as in rs",
    ", we have to tune the brane tensions to obtain flat 6d slices .",
    "note that @xmath2 setups are very restricted by the requirement of anomaly cancellation in the 6d boundary gauge theories @xcite .",
    "to make contact with a randall - sundrum type construction , we now compactify two spatial dimensions of the @xmath2 . thus @xmath29 the simplest choice for @xmath6 is a torus @xmath30 , since in this case we do not need any additional sources in the einstein equations to get a consistent background solution .",
    "the metric becomes : @xmath31 where for simplicity we assume a common radius parameter @xmath32 .",
    "note that the measured radius of the torus includes a warp factor .    almost as simple is a compactification on a sphere @xmath33 .",
    "since the sphere has curvature , this requires an additional bulk source .",
    "as discussed for example in @xcite , two bulk scalar fields with a simple potential allows a solution of the equations of motion with a `` hedgehog '' profile for the scalars .",
    "any 7d bulk field can be expanded in a complete orthonormal basis of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes for @xmath6 .",
    "these are just sines and cosines for @xmath30 , and spherical harmonics for @xmath33 . substituting the kk expansion into the 7d action",
    ", we can then integrate over @xmath6 to obtain an effective 5d action .",
    "we will do this explicitly for the case of a 7d bulk scalar on @xmath7 , and then extend the results to discuss the 7d graviton . for the torus with radius @xmath32 the squared kk momenta",
    "are @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 are integers .    in the underlying theory",
    "there will in general be additional bulk modes arising from @xmath18 or @xmath4 branes wrapping one or more cycles of the torus .",
    "these will be particle - like modes if the the other dimensions of the branes are already wrapped around compact cycles of @xmath23 , or whatever replaces @xmath23 in a realistic model .",
    "for example , an @xmath4 brane wrapped on @xmath23 is a baryonic string @xcite , which can in turn wind around cycles of the torus .",
    "such modes can be labelled by their winding numbers , which form a two - vector of integers @xmath37 , @xmath38,2 .    whereas the kk mode contributions to the world - sheet hamiltonian of the string are proportional to @xmath39 , the winding modes contribute @xmath40 note that the parameter @xmath21 above will in general differ from the @xmath21 introduced above ( [ eqn : fdef ] ) , by a factor of order one which depends upon how strings emerge from the original 11d @xmath3 theory .",
    "we can write down the equations of motion for the bulk scalar in the 5d effective theory , expanded into kk and winding modes @xmath41 : @xmath42\\phi_{\\vec{n}\\vec{m } } = 0 \\ , , \\label{eqn : seom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is an explicit bulk mass from the 7d theory .",
    "the usual warping of randall - sundrum is visible in ( [ eqn : seom ] ) as the fact that the bulk mass - squared term is multiplied by @xmath44 relative to the 4d momentum - squared @xmath45 .",
    "we observe as well two new kinds of behavior :    * the kk mode mass - squared contributions from the torus have no warping relative to the 4d momentum - squared @xmath46 . *",
    "the winding mode mass - squared contributions have double warping compared to the ordinary bulk mass term , _",
    "i.e. , _ they are multiplied by @xmath47 relative to the 4d momentum - squared @xmath46 .",
    "now we change variables to the conformal coordinate @xmath48 , suppress indices , and perform the useful rescaling @xmath49 .",
    "the equation of motion becomes : @xmath50h = 0 \\ , , \\label{eqn : fseom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , and we are putting the 4d momenta on - shell , with @xmath52 denoting the physical 4d mass .",
    "it is the mass spectrum of @xmath53 that we want to determine from an analysis of the solutions of ( [ eqn : fseom ] ) . for @xmath54 ,",
    "this is the equation of motion for a 5d massive bulk scalar in @xmath0 , as first analyzed in @xcite . in general ( [ eqn : fseom ] )",
    "is equivalent to the mathieu equation @xcite .",
    "we can take ( [ eqn : fseom ] ) as the starting point for a 5d kaluza - klein mode analysis in @xmath0 . to get the analog of scalars in a randall - sundrum model",
    ", we can impose neumann boundary conditions at the location of one or two flat branes .",
    "these branes have co - dimension one , i.e. they are 5-branes , located at @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the parameter @xmath57 is assumed to be of order the tev scale .    to analyze graviton modes",
    ", we use the fact that in",
    "_ e.g. _ harmonic gauge each component of the graviton obeys ( [ eqn : fseom ] ) .",
    "the appropriate boundary conditions for the graviton modes , after tuning the brane tensions to their conventional rs values , are : @xmath58_{z=1/k } = \\left[zh'(z)+3h(z)\\right]_{z=1/t } = 0\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this means that the graviton mode solutions are identical to the @xmath59 scalar solutions , up to an overall factor .",
    "let us start with the simple case where @xmath60 .",
    "the solution to ( [ eqn : fseom ] ) depends upon the sign of @xmath61 .",
    "there are no solutions for @xmath62 . for @xmath63",
    "the solution is @xmath64 . }",
    "\\label{eqn : solsa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we only consider the case of light modes where @xmath65 , then the boundary conditions determine @xmath66 and yield @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "the roots of ( [ eqn : specsa ] ) determine the mass spectrum .",
    "these solutions represent towers of toroidal kk modes on top of the tev - spaced massive warped kk modes of randall - sundrum .",
    "the rs spectrum itself is also modified , since _",
    "e.g. , _ for @xmath69 , @xmath70 the relevant bessel functions are @xmath71 and @xmath72 , rather than @xmath73 and @xmath74 as in standard rs .",
    "since the toroidal kk modes are not warped , @xmath75 corresponds to compactifications large enough that we will see the toroidal kk excitations with spacings comparable to the randall - sundrum kk modes . in order not to reintroduce the hierarchy problem",
    ", we would then need some mechanism that naturally stabilizes @xmath32 at inverse tev values .",
    "by contrast , if our torus were compactifying flat rather than @xmath8 directions , then @xmath76 would give tev - spaced kk excitations @xcite .",
    "in the special case @xmath77 , the solution to the equation of motion is @xmath78 similarly , the boundary conditions give us @xmath79 this set of equations has no solution except when @xmath80 , _",
    "i.e. , _ when there is a scalar zero mode .",
    "the solutions then represent the tower of toroidal kk modes on top of the zero mode .",
    "the most interesting new feature of our analysis is the spectrum of winding modes . for simplicity",
    ", we will only consider the simplest case , with @xmath70 and @xmath69 .",
    "then ( [ eqn : fseom ] ) reduces to : @xmath81 where we have introduced the notation @xmath82 . as usual in randall - sundrum setups",
    ", we will assume that @xmath83 is less than 1 but not dramatically so , _",
    "e.g. , _ @xmath84 .",
    "first of all , we want to see if there exists a zero mode . setting @xmath85",
    "the solution of ( [ eqn : maineq ] ) is @xmath86 \\ ; . \\label{eqn : zerosol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the boundary conditions give : @xmath87 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which can not both be true at the same time unless @xmath88 .",
    "therefore there is no zero mode for the case with winding modes only .    for the massive winding modes ,",
    "the solutions can be found numerically .",
    "here we summarize the results .",
    "this corresponds to the smallest compactification radius , where we expect the winding modes to be the lightest . like the kk modes",
    ", these should appear as additional excitations on top of the tev - spaced warped kk modes of randall - sundrum .",
    "we find that the rs zero mode does not have any winding excitations .",
    "the winding excitations of the lowest lying massive rs modes have masses given by @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the masses of the first two massive rs modes .",
    "notice that the mass splittings are very small , of order @xmath94 ev .",
    "this corresponds to a large compactification radius , thus were it not for warping we would expect the winding excitations to be extremely heavy .",
    "however , because of the double warping of the winding term in ( [ eqn : fseom ] ) , we find that in this case the winding excitations are actually of order t. once again the rs zero mode does not have any winding excitations .",
    "the winding excitations of the lowest lying massive rs mode have masses as shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "note that the spacing of the winding modes can be considerably less than @xmath57 if @xmath32 is small , _",
    "e.g. , _ for @xmath96 and @xmath84 the spacing is a fraction of @xmath57 .",
    "our results for the spectrum of kk and winding modes can be understood qualitatively as a combination of warping with the usual t - duality relation between the kk and winding spectra . for simplicity",
    "we will not distinguish between @xmath97 and @xmath21 in this discussion .",
    "when the compactification radius @xmath32 is of order @xmath98 , the toroidal kk modes are or order @xmath57 , with no additional warping .",
    "the t - dual winding modes are of order @xmath99 , multiplied by a double warp factor @xmath100 ; thus the winding modes are of order @xmath101 , as reported above .",
    "when the compactification radius @xmath32 is of order @xmath102 , the toroidal kk modes are of order @xmath97 , with no additional warping .",
    "the t - dual winding modes are of order @xmath97 as well , but again multiplied by a double warp factor @xmath100 .",
    "the winding excitations are on top of the massive warped kk excitations , which are of order @xmath57 .",
    "since the masses add in quadrature , we expect the splittings of the winding mode excitations to be of order @xmath103 as reported above .",
    "the @xmath104 scenarios presented here are as well - motivated as the @xmath0 effective theories that are the basis for standard randall - sundrum . both are stripped down versions of physics that could actually emerge from string theory in a robust way , albeit decorated with many stringy complications .",
    "the spectrum of bulk graviton and scalar modes in our @xmath2 models can differ from standard rs1 in several ways .",
    "first of all , because we start with @xmath2 instead of @xmath0 , the spacing of the massive graviton modes is determined by the zeroes of the bessel function @xmath105 , rather than @xmath106 . the smoking gun signature of rs1 at the lhc is @xcite a tower of resonances with masses 1 , 1.83 , 2.66 , 3.48 , ... , in units of the first heavy resonance . for our models ,",
    "the prediction is a tower of resonances with masses 1 , 1.64 , 2.26 , 2.88 , ... , in units of the first heavy resonance .",
    "lhc experiments will also be sensitive to the extra toroidal kk states , if @xmath32 is of order a tev .",
    "the spectrum of these additional excitations is evenly spaced , distinguishing it from extra toroidal dimensions not associated with @xmath8 directions @xcite .",
    "lhc experiments may be sensitive to our extra winding states , depending upon which bulk modes have winding excitations , and how they couple to standard model particles . for @xmath32 of order @xmath98 ,",
    "the winding states have discrete mass spacings or order @xmath57 . for @xmath32 of order",
    "@xmath102 , the winding states are essentially a continuum on top of a mass gap of @xmath107 .",
    "this is somewhat reminiscent of lr models @xcite , but clearly distinct since in that case there is no mass gap in the continuum kk spectrum .",
    "light winding states have been discussed in the literature @xcite in the context of add models @xcite with a tev string scale @xcite .",
    "here we have obtained tev scale string winding states without lowering the string scale .",
    "this is due to the double warping which is a generic feature of winding states along compactified @xmath8 directions .",
