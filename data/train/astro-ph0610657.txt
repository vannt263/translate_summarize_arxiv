    "the physical quantities are expressed in powers of the planck mass @xmath4 , planck length @xmath5 , or planck time @xmath6 .",

    "in general relativity we distingush between static and stationary metric .",
    "stationary configurations are described by the metric coefficients that do not depend on time . for static configurations",

    "numerical integration of ( [ eq40 ] ) and ( [ eq42 ] ) from @xmath39 to some radius @xmath40 with the boundary conditions @xmath41 is rather straightforward and , as a result , a nontrivial spherical distribution of matter is obtained .",
    "the boundary is usually naturally provided at the radius @xmath40 where @xmath42 . in the case when the @xmath42 point does not exist , one must integrate up to infinity or up to a chosen cutoff radius .",
    "it is often more convenient ( e.g. , if the equation of state is given in the form @xmath43 ) to express the field equations in the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) form @xmath44 @xmath45 here , equation ( [ eq48 ] ) is obtained from ( [ eq40 ] ) with the help of the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium ( [ eq17 ] ) which may be written as @xmath46 the set of equations ( [ eq48])-([eq51 ] ) is called the _ tov equations_.      general relativity reduces to newtonian theory in the limit of weak gravity and low velocities .",

    "traditionally , compact astrophysical objects represent the final stages of stellar evolution : white dwarfs ( wd ) , neutron stars ( ns ) , and black holes ( bh ) . they differ from normal stars in two basic ways .    first , since they do not burn nuclear fuel , they can not support themselves against gravitational collapse by generating thermal pressure . instead , either they are prevented from collapsing by the degeneracy pressure ( wds and nss ) or they are completely collapsed ( bhs ) . with the exception of the spontaneously radiating  mini \" bhs with masses",
    "less than @xmath73 kg and radii smaller than a fermi , all these objects are essentially static over the lifetime of the universe .",
    "the second characteristic distinguishing compact objects from normal stars is their exceedingly small size .",
    "relative to normal stars of comparable mass , compact objects have much smaller radii and hence , much stronger surface gravity .",
    ".2 in    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     .2 in    could boson stars fit the whole range of compact supermassive galactic centers ? to answer this question , we proceed as in the case of neutrino stars .",
    "we assume that the most massive objects are boson stars with maximal mass , i.e. , @xmath74  @xmath75 , for the supermassive compact dark object at the center m87 . from this",
    "we find @xmath76 which also fixes the radius given by ( [ eq131 ] ) @xmath77 quite close to the radius @xmath78 of the neutrino star discussed in section [ neutrino ] .",
    "since the radius of a boson star does not depend on its mass , this value should also fit the radii of all supermassive bhs .",
    "however , it obviously does not fit the observed radius limit of sgr a@xmath79 , @xmath80 au , and even less it fits the radius of a typical agn of 7 au ( section [ agn - mass ] ) .    hence , boson stars with a quartic self - interaction are ruled out as a unique explanation for compact supermassive objects at galactic centers and agn .",
    "again , it is not excluded that some of the galactic centers harbor a boson star .",
    "dark energy ( de ) is a substance of negative pressure needed for an accelerated cosmology . in order to achieve acceleration",
    ", de must satisfy an equation of state @xmath81 , where @xmath82 may depend on the cosmological scale @xmath83 but at present ( @xmath84 ) @xmath85 .",
    "in addition , one also expects that de satisfies the dominant energy condition , in which case the equation of state satisfies @xmath86 .",
    "nevertheless , matter with @xmath87 dubbed  phantom energy \" @xcite has recently received attention as it might fit the most recent sn 1a data slightly better than the usual de .    in cosmological context , @xmath88 is homogeneous and it is normally assumed that de does not cluster .",
    "however , it is not excluded that owing to gravitational instability , small inhomogeneities ( analogous to dark - matter inhomogeneities ) grow and build structure , e.g. , in the form of spherical configurations . hence , we define _ dark - energy stars _ as spherical solutions to einstein s equation with matter described by the de equation of state @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that de could be described by a scalar field theory ( quintessence ) with a suitably chosen interaction potential and/or with a noncanonical kinetic energy term in the lagrangian .",
    "this scalar field theory would correspond to an effective equation of state with desirable properties @xcite . in this way , de stars could be regarded as boson stars but with a rather unusual self - interaction .    here , we briefly discuss two examples of de stars : de sitter gravastars and chaplygin gravastars .",
    "the simplest example of de star is a gravitating vacuum star or a _",
    "gravastar_. chapline et al .",
    "@xcite put forth an interesting proposal based on analogies to condensed matter systems where the effective general relativity was an emergent phenomenon . specifically , assuming the schwarzschild exterior , they suggested that the sphere where the lapse function @xmath89 vanished marked a quantum phase transition , @xmath12 increasing again at @xmath90 . as this required negative pressure , the authors of @xcite assumed the interior vacuum condensate to be described by de sitter space with the equation of state @xmath91 .",
    "subsequently , the idea of gravitational vacuum condensate , or ` gravastar ' , was taken up by mazur and mottola @xcite and dymnikova @xcite , replacing the horizon with a shell of stiff matter astride the surface at @xmath92 .",
    "visser and wiltshire @xcite and recently carter @xcite also examined the stability of the gravastar using the israel thin - shell formalism @xcite .",
    "given the mass m , the interior is described by a solution , similar to the the einstein - de sitter universe , with constant density @xmath93 up to the de sitter radius @xmath94 ( actually slightly further out ) . hence , the interior is de sitter , @xmath95 being the vacuum energy density .",
    "the lapse function is given by @xmath96 with @xmath97    in order to join the interior solutions to a schwarzschild exterior at a spherical boundary of radius @xmath40 , it is necessary to put a thin spherical shell at the boundary with a surface density and a surface tension satisfying israel s junction conditions @xcite .",
    "as the pressure does not vanish at the boundary , it must be compensated by a negative surface tension of the shell .",
    "the gravastar has no horizon or singularity ! its surface is located at a radius just slightly larger than the schwarzschild radius @xmath98 , @xmath99 .",
    "hence , there is practically no observational way to distinguish a schwarzschild bh from a gravastar .",
    "basically , any bh - like object observed in nature may be a gravastar .    in spite of these attractive features",
    "the gravastar has been met with a cool reception .",
    "certainly , the assumption of a de sitter interior presents a quandary : on the one hand , the quantum phase transition would suggest that the associated cosmological constant is a fundamental parameter ; on the other hand , to accommodate the mass range of supermassive black - hole candidates , it must vary over some six orders of magnitude .",
    "in addition , the notorious cosmological constant problem is reversed for gravastars : why is the vacuum energy in the interior of a gravastar so much larger than the observed vacuum energy density in the universe ? if we identify the most massive black - hole candidate observed at the center of m87 , with mass @xmath100 , with the de sitter gravastar , then @xmath101 , to be contrasted with the @xmath102 values wanted for cosmology .",
    "another question is how does a gravastar form ?",
    "the entropy of a stellar mass gravastar is much less than the entropy of an ordinary star and this would require an extremely efficient cooling mechanism before gravastars could form during stellar collapse @xcite .      consider a particular form of de with a rather peculiar equation of state @xmath103 equation ( [ eq941 ] ) describes the chaplygin gas which , for @xmath104 , has attracted some attention as a dark - energy candidate @xcite .",
    "consider a self - gravitating chaplygin gas and look for static solutions .",
    "in particular , we look for static chaplygin gas configurations in the phantom ( @xmath87 ) regime , i.e. , when @xmath105 we show that these configurations could provide an alternative scenario for compact massive objects at galactic centers @xcite",
    ". moreover , equation ( [ eq941 ] ) yields the de sitter gravastar solution in the limit when the central density of the static solution approaches the value @xmath106 .    combining ( [ eq941 ] ) with the tov equations ( [ eq48 ] ) , and ( [ eq49 ] )",
    ", one has @xmath107",
    "@xmath108    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we exhibit the resulting @xmath109 for selected values of @xmath110 .",
    "the solutions depend essentially on the magnitude of @xmath95 relative to @xmath106 . in the following",
    "we summarize the properties of three classes of solutions corresponding to whether @xmath95 is larger , smaller , or equal to @xmath106 .",
    "* i ) * for @xmath111 , the density @xmath35 increases and the lapse function @xmath12 decreases with @xmath14 starting from the origin up to the black - hole horizon radius @xmath112 , where @xmath113 . in the limit @xmath114 , a limiting solution exists with a singular behavior @xmath115 near the origin .    *",
    "ii ) * for @xmath116 , both @xmath35 and @xmath12 decrease with @xmath14 up to the radius @xmath117 where they vanish .",
    "at that point the pressure @xmath36 blows up to @xmath118 owing to ( [ eq941 ] ) .",
    "the enclosed mass @xmath24 is always less than @xmath119 , never reaching the black - hole horizon , i.e. , the radius where @xmath120 .",
    "* iii ) * for @xmath121 , the density @xmath35 remains constant equal to @xmath106 up to the de sitter radius @xmath94 .",
    "hence , we recover the de sitter solution precisely as in the gravastar case .",
    "as @xmath122 from above or from below , solutions * i ) * or * ii ) * , respectively , converge to * iii ) * except at the endpoint .",
    "the lapse function in * iii ) * joins the schwarzschild solution outside continuously , whereas in * i ) * and * ii ) * it happens discontinuously .",
    "as in the case of a de sitter gravastar , in order to join our interior solutions to a schwarzschild exterior at a spherical boundary of radius @xmath40 , it is necessary to put a thin spherical shell at the boundary with a surface density and a surface tension satisfying israel s junction conditions @xcite .",
    "case * ii ) * , together with * iii ) * , is of particular interest as we would like to interpret the supermassive compact dark objects at the galactic centers in terms of phantom energy rather than in terms of a classical black hole .",
    "it is natural to assume that the most massive such object is described by the de sitter gravastar , i.e. , solution * iii ) * ( depicted by the solid line in fig .",

    "clearly , solutions belonging to class * ii ) * , can fit all masses @xmath125 .",
    "however , for the phenomenology of supermassive galactic centers it is important to find , at least approximately , the mass - radius relationship for these solutions .",
    "this may be done in the low central density approximation , i.e. , @xmath126 , which is similar to the newtonian approximation but , in contrast to the newtonian approximation , one can not neglect the pressure term in ( [ eq48 ] ) .",
    "moreover , as may be easily shown , in this approximation @xmath127 , so that the pressure term becomes dominant .",
    "next , neglecting @xmath128 with respect to @xmath14 , as in the usual newtonian approximation , equation ( [ eq943 ] ) simplifies to @xmath129 , with the solution @xmath130 which gives a mass - radius relation @xmath131 the mass - radius relationship @xmath132",
    "which phantom gravastars obey , offers the prospect of unifying the description of all supermassive compact dark objects at the galactic centers , as chaplygin - gas phantom gravastars with masses ranging from @xmath133 to @xmath134 . indeed , assuming that the most massive compact dark object , observed at the center of m87 , is a chaplygin phantom gravastar near the de sitter gravastar limit , with @xmath135 , the compact dark object at the center of our galaxy , with mass @xmath136 ,",
    "would have a radius @xmath137 = 2.06 lhr if the scaling law ( [ eq945 ] ) holds .",
