    "the fashion of star formation in galaxies can significantly change dust properties . in young galaxies ,",
    "type - ii supernovae create dust , and also change the dust size and component @xcite .",
    "in addition , uv radiation from young stars is effectively absorbed by dust and therefore determines the temperature of dust grains .",
    "besides , the dust can affect the star formation efficiency itself via hydrogen molecule formation and the cooling by thermal emission . accordingly , dust properties such as amount , temperature , size and composition should tightly correlate with the star formation history .",
    "hence , understanding the dust properties is a significant issue in the study of galaxy evolution .",
    "so far , the sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) flux from distant galaxies has been detected at redshifts of @xmath11 .",

    "hence , the dust properties in normal star - forming galaxies ( sfr @xmath13 ) at high redshifts ( which mean @xmath14 in this paper ) have not been hitherto understood well .",
    "recently , some observations are dedicated to detect the sub - mm flux from early star - forming galaxies ( sfr @xmath15 ) like lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) by using newly developed facilities @xcite .",
    "although @xcite did not detect notable sub - mm flux from laes and lbgs in the ssa22 region within the detection limit of @xmath16 , they discovered sub - mm sources in the vicinity of laes .",
    "@xcite showed that the upper - limit of sub - mm flux for lbgs at @xmath17 is @xmath18 from stacked data .",
    "hence , with recent sub - mm telescopes ( e.g. hershel , aztek ) , it seems very difficult to detect sub - mm flux from high - z star - forming galaxies with sfr@xmath19 .",
    "moreover , the determination of dust temperature is a hard task in the observational study , because it requires the flux data at many wavelengths in sub - mm band .",
    "hence , one often assumes the dust temperature to speculate spectral energy distributions ( sed ) .",
    "then , the estimation of @xmath20 by integrating speculated sed suffer from the uncertainty of the assumed dust temperature .",
    "the uncertainty leads to the misestimation of sfr and dust amount .",
    "a theoretical model may help to relate the observed sub - mm flux with the dust properties in star - forming galaxies .",
    "such attempts have been made by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite constructed an sed model of dusty star - forming galaxies by solving the radiative transfer in spherical symmetry .",
    "@xcite , based on cosmological sph simulations , employed homogeneous distributions of stars and dust in an identified lae .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown through ultra - high - resolution numerical simulations that interstellar media in early star - forming galaxies become quite clumpy as a result of multiple supernovae .",
    "hence , to construct the sed for early star - forming galaxies , it is imperative to solve three - dimensional radiative transfer in clumpy interstellar media .    here , we theoretically explore the dust amount and temperature in star - forming galaxies by solving three - dimensional radiative transfer , based on a chemodynamic simulation of a primordial galaxy by @xcite .",
    "since the model galaxy well reproduces the observed properties of lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) at @xmath1 gyr and lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath3 gyr , we can predict the sub - mm brightness in the lae and lbg phases in early star - forming galaxies . in the present analyses ,",
    "the cosmological parameters are assumed to be @xmath21 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in  2 , the model and numerical method are described . in  3 , the results on dust properties in early star - forming galaxies are presented . in  4 , the detectability by alma is discussed .",
    " 5 is devoted to the summary .",
    "our model galaxy is a supernova - dominated star - forming galaxy simulated by an ultra - high - resolution ( @xmath25 fixed cartesian grids ) chemodynamics calculation coupled with the collisionless dynamics of star particles .",
    "the simulation pursues the early evolution ( @xmath26 years ) of a primeval galaxy as an assemblage of sub - galactic condensations of @xmath27 , building up a system with the total mass of @xmath28 [ see @xcite for the simulation details ] .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the model galaxy is @xmath29 at @xmath30 gyr , @xmath31 at @xmath32 gyr , @xmath33 at @xmath34 gyr , and @xmath35 at @xmath36 gyr .",
    "the metal and dust in the galaxy is enriched by the continuous type ii supernovae due to vigorous star formation , and exhibits complex inhomogeneous dust distributions ( figure 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "according to the lyman @xmath37 luminosity , the early evolutionary stage is divided into two phases : one is the lae - phase ( @xmath1 gyr ) and the other is the lbg - phase ( @xmath3 gyr ) .",
    "most of lyman @xmath37 emission comes from the cooling radiation by interstellar gas , and the luminosity reaches @xmath38 erg s@xmath22 at @xmath39 gyr and @xmath40 erg s@xmath22 at @xmath41 gyr , respectively .",
    "they nicely match the observed luminosity of laes and also well resemble laes with respect to other properties . at @xmath42 gyr ,",
    "the lyman @xmath37 luminosity quickly declines to several @xmath43 erg s@xmath22 that is lower than the detection limit , and the sed is dominated by stellar continuum .",
    "this phase appears like lbgs .",
    "the model galaxy at this phase has stellar age ( @xmath44 ) and mass ( @xmath45 ) similar to typical lbgs at @xmath46 , while it is older and more massive than typical lbgs at @xmath47 @xcite . on the other hand , a part of lbgs at @xmath47",
    "have been detected by _",
    "irac , and show the similar age and mass to our model galaxy @xcite . therefore",
    ", our model galaxy at a later phase is probably corresponding to typical lbgs for @xmath46 , and a massive subset of lbgs for @xmath47 .      the radiation from young stars propagates in the highly inhomogeneous interstellar media containing dust .",
    "we compute the three - dimensional radiative transfer ( rt ) of stellar radiation to derive the dust temperature .",
    "the rt calculations are done as the post - processing for each evolutionary stage of model galaxy . for the purpose ,",
    "the data of the hydrodynamic simulations are coarse - grained into @xmath48 cartesian grids .",
    "the rt scheme used in this paper is the authentic radiation transfer ( art ) method which is originally developed by @xcite .",
    "the procedure is basically the same as that in @xcite .",
    "our art method is based on the _ long - characteristic _ method .",
    "usually , the _ short - characteristic _ method is computationally less costly than the long - characteristic method , by an order of @xmath49 which is a grid number in the linear dimension .",
    "however , the short - characteristic method suffers from numerical diffusion effect .",
    "the art method is devised to reduce the computational cost to a level similar to the short - characteristic method with keeping the accuracy equivalent to the long - characteristic method .",
    "hence , the present method allows us to calculate the transfer of radiation from a large number of sources .    in this work ,",
    "the rt equation is solved along @xmath50 rays with uniform angular resolution from each star particle .",
    "the number of star particles is @xmath51 .",
    "hence , we carry out the rt calculation for @xmath52 rays for each snapshot .",
    "we map individual star particles to nearest grids , and set radiation rays in an isotropic fashion from each star particle .",
    "we distribute the interstellar dust in proportion to the metallicity , assuming the size distribution of @xmath53 @xcite , where @xmath54 is the radius of a dust grain .",
    "we suppose the grain size in the range of @xmath55 m as our fiducial model .",
    "the dust mass in a cell is calculated by a following simple relation between metallicity and dust @xcite , @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the dust mass , gas mass , and metallicity in a cell . the density in a dust grain",
    "is assumed to be that of silicate - like grains , 3g@xmath60 . the optical depth by dust is given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the absorption coefficient factor and the grain number density , respectively .",
    "we adopt the @xmath64-value of silicate grain derived in @xcite .",
    "of course , there are some options for the dust model .",
    "the present dust model is motivated by the supernova dust model in @xcite . in their model ,",
    "the small dust grains of @xmath65 are readily destroyed in shock wave , so that the typical size becomes @xmath66 . on the other hand , @xcite pointed out that the typical size could be reduced to @xmath67 for the first grains in the early universe .",
    "the number density of dust grains increases with decreasing dust size for the constant amount of dust , while the absorption cross section decreases with the dust size . in figure",
    "[ fig : mass_sigma ] , the extinction per unit dust mass is compared between @xmath68 and @xmath67 dust .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : mass_sigma ] , the absorption efficiency does not change appreciably with changing the dust size .",
    "therefore , the infrared luminosity and dust temperature are not so sensitive to the dust size .",
    "actually , in a test calculation for @xmath69 dust , the temperature decreases by just a few k. the difference in the peak flux at 850",
    "@xmath70 m is a few per cent , because the peak of thermal emission shifts toward 850 @xmath70 m with decreasing temperature .    on the other hand , the calzetti s law @xmath71    @xcite",
    "is frequently used for dust extinction in local galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : calzetti ] , the extinction curve of our dust model is compared to the calzetti s law .",
    "our model is somewhat flatter than the calzetti s law in uv - optical range .",
    "however , even if we use calzetti s extinction curve , the infrared luminosity does not significantly change from our model . actually , by a test calculation",
    ", we find that the relative difference is twenty per cent for ir luminosity , and the difference in dust temperature is @xmath72 a few k.      we evaluate the dust temperature @xmath73 by solving the radiative equilibrium between heating by photo - absorption ( @xmath74 ) and cooling by thermal emission ( @xmath75 ) , which are given by @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the mean intensity of stellar radiation and the heating term by cmb radiation , respectively .",
    "we simplify the right side of this equation as follows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath81 is the mean dust size weighted by the size distribution function , @xmath82 the @xmath83 is a mean @xmath64-value weighted by the planck function , @xmath84 then , we obtain the dust temperature by @xmath85     and @xmath69 silicate dust , respectively .",
    "the q - value of silicate dust is taken from @xcite . ]",
    "in figure  [ fig : all ] , we present the time variation of dust component as a function of the galactic evolution time . figure  [ fig : all](a ) shows the dust - to - gas mass ratio ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the ratio increases monotonically with the galaxy evolution owing to continuous supernovae .",
    "@xmath86 is @xmath87 ( corresponding to the metallicity @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the solar metallicity ) at 0.1 gyr and reaches @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) at 1.0 gyr .",
    "figure  [ fig : all](b ) shows the total dust mass in the model galaxy .",
    "the dust mass is @xmath92 at 0.1 gyr , and then @xmath93 at @xmath94 0.3 gyr .",
    "in contrast to the monotonic increase of metallicity , the total dust mass does not change greatly at @xmath94 0.3 gyr .",
    "this trend comes from the fact that the continuous energy input by multiple supernovae results in the blowout of dusty gas from the halo .",
    "the fraction of escaped gas to the initial amount becomes @xmath95 per cent at @xmath96 gyr .",
    "our model shows that the metallicity reaches the level of @xmath97 in the late phase of lae .",
    "very recently , @xcite assessed the metallicity of laes to be @xmath98 , which is significantly higher than was previously thought for laes .",
    "this is concordant with our results .",
    "figure [ fig : all](c ) shows the radiation energy absorbed by dust , and figure [ fig : all](d ) shows the absorbed fraction to the total radiation energy emitted by stars .",
    "the model galaxy has a blue sed owing to young stars , and the absorption efficiency by dust decreases steeply with increasing wavelength .",
    "thus , most of energy absorbed by dust is attributed to uv - optical continuum radiation from stars in the range of @xmath99 , and strongly depends on sfr and dust amount .",
    "figure [ fig : all](c ) shows that the absorbed energy by dust is peaked at 0.3 gyr , although the metallicity increases monotonically .",
    "this is because the dust is distributed compactly around star forming regions in an early phase , and hence the uv photons from stars are effectively absorbed .",
    "figure  [ fig : tempdist ] shows the dust temperature distributions , when the model galaxy is placed at @xmath100 .",
    "the dust temperature is @xmath101 near star - forming regions , while @xmath102 far from there . in an early phase ( @xmath103 0.1 - 0.3 gyr ) , the high - temperature regions are distributed extensively according to the distributions of star - forming regions . in a later phase ( @xmath103 0.5 - 1.0 gyr ) , the distributions of high - temperature dust are confined into the central regions as a result of the dynamical evolution of star - forming regions .",
    "we statistically study the dust temperature distributions .",
    "figure   [ fig : tempfrac ] shows the mass fraction of dust in a given temperature range . in an early stage , dust is confined in each sub - halo , and therefore it is distributed near star - forming regions .",
    "thus , at @xmath39 gyr , a part of dust has high temperature of @xmath104 k , and the mass fraction is broadly distributed in the range of @xmath105 k. thereafter , the dusty gas is blown away by supernova explosions and is distributed diffusely in the extended regions .",
    "then , a part of dust , which is far from young stars , can not absorb much radiation energy , and therefore becomes in a cooler state .",
    "hence , in a later phase , dust with high temperature of @xmath104 k disappears , and the dust temperature falls in the range of @xmath106 k.    figure  [ fig : tave ] shows the mean temperature as a function of evolution time .",
    "filled and open circles are the mass weighted mean temperatures and the energy weighted ones , respectively .",
    "the mass weighted mean is @xmath107 in the lae phase , while @xmath108 in the lbg phase .",
    "the energy weighted mean is @xmath109 in the lae phase , while @xmath110 in the lbg phase .",
    "the high - temperature dust emits thermal radiation more effectively than colder one owing to the higher q - value and the strong temperature - dependence of emissivity .",
    "hence , the energy weighted mean temperatures are higher by @xmath111 than the mass weighted ones . the mean temperatures decline with the evolution time especially in early phases",
    "this is intimately relevant to the sub - mm brightness of the galaxy .",
    "recently , @xcite have studied the dust properties of galaxies with @xmath112 in the redshift range @xmath113 , and found the dust temperature to be @xmath114 k. @xcite have found that the average dust temperature is @xmath115 k for submm galaxies with the average redshift of @xmath116 .",
    "these temperatures are comparable to the dust temperature in our calculations .",
    "we compute the intrinsic spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of the stellar component in the model galaxy by using the population synthesis code pgase v2.0 @xcite .",
    "we place the model galaxy at several redshifts . the initial mass function ( imf )",
    "is assumed to be that by @xcite in the mass range of @xmath117 .",
    "also , the effects by the age and metallicity of stellar population are incorporated by interpolating the table generated by pgase .",
    "the dust temerature is primarily determined by the uv continuum from ob stars with @xmath118 . for the salpeter imf in the range of @xmath117 ,",
    "the mass fraction of stars with @xmath118 is 0.267 . if we suppose the range of @xmath119 , the fraction is 0.287 .",
    "hence , the upper bound of mass range is not so significant on determining the dust temperature .    in this work , at first",
    ", we derive the intrinsic sed of stellar component by pgase , and correct the sed by incorporating the dust extinction through three - dimensional rt simulations .",
    "then , we evaluate the dust temperature and the thermal emission following the equation ( 7 ) . finally , we get the emergent sed by combining the dust absorption - corrected stellar sed with the thermal emission from dust . fig . [",
    "fig : sed ] shows the resultant sed of the model galaxy in the observed frame after making the k - correction . as well known , @xmath120 , the flux density does not decrease with redshift owing to the effect of negative k - correction .      here",
    ", we see the time variations of the sub - millimeter brightness , focusing on the flux at @xmath121 .",
    "figure  [ fig : smtotal ] shows the total flux at @xmath121 in observed frame ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "interestingly , the sub - millimeter brightness is peaked at 0.3 gyr ( lae phase ) , independent of the assumed redshift .",
    "as already shown in figure  [ fig : all](a ) , the dust - to - gas ratio ( metallicity ) increases monotonically with time .",
    "but , the sub - millimeter brightness does not increases according to the increase of metallicity .",
    "this is because , in the lae phase , dust grains are concentrated on clumpy star - forming regions and therefore the dust grains can be effectively heated up by stellar radiation . on the other hand , the continuous supernovae drive dust grains far away from star - forming regions at @xmath123 gyr ( lbg phase ) .",
    "then the grains can not absorb much radiation from stars and turn into a cold state . as a result ,",
    "the sub - millimeter brightness declines .",
    "the relative sub - millimeter flux at each epoch depends on the redshift @xmath124 .",
    "if the galaxy is at @xmath125 , the total flux at 0.1 gyr is smaller than that at 0.5 gyr and 1.0 gyr , although the total absorbed energy is nearly equal .",
    "this is due to the fact that the flux of @xmath121 is sensitive to the dust temperature .",
    "the spectral shape of dust emission is basically that of the black body , although the @xmath64-value affects the shape to some degree .",
    "the temperature , which exhibits a peak at @xmath121 in the observed frame , is @xmath126 for a galaxy at @xmath100 .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : tave ] , the mass - weighted mean temperature declines with the evolution time , and the temperature at 0.5 gyr and 1.0 gyr is closer to 13.65 k than that at 0.1 gyr . therefore , we conclude that the low sub - mm flux in an earlier lae phase is not attributed to the low dust amount but rather to the higher dust temperature . for higher galaxy redshifts , the absolute flux decreases of course with increasing redshift .",
    "but , the difference of the flux between @xmath127 and 0.5 ( or 1.0 ) gyr becomes smaller , since the @xmath121 in the observed frame is corresponding to shorter wavelengths .        .",

    "we set the model galaxy at each redshift ( circle : @xmath131 , triangle : @xmath100 , square : @xmath128 , cross : @xmath129 and star : @xmath130 ) . ]",
    "here , we assess the feasibility to detect early star - forming galaxies with sfr of @xmath132 by _ atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array _ ( alma ) . in the present simulation ,",
    "the total flux of @xmath133 in the lbg phase is @xmath134 mjy for a galaxy at @xmath100 .",

    "our prediction is under their upper limit , and therefore higher sensitivity is required to detect sub - mm flux from lbgs at @xmath47 . on the other hand ,",
    "there are a few bright lbgs detected at sub - millimeter which show @xmath144 mjy and @xmath145 @xcite",
    ". these may be more massive and dusty star - burst systems .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : smdist ] , the map of the brightness temperature at @xmath146 is shown for the model galaxy placed at @xmath147 .",
    "the brightness temperature @xmath148 is given by @xmath149 the higher @xmath148 traces the star - forming regions .",
    "clumpy clouds with higher @xmath148 are distributed over an extended area in the lae phase ( @xmath150 gyr ) , while those are concentrated near the center in the lbg phase ( @xmath151 gyr ) .",

    "the area to cover the half mass of stars is @xmath157 . at a later phase ,",
    "the model galaxy becomes as compact as @xmath158 .",
    "hence , the number of beams to cover the area will be quite large .",
    "even for the later compact phase , the required time to cover the area will be a few hundred hours .",
    "thus , the observations with the angular resolution of @xmath159 do not seem achievable to trace the sub - mm structure for early star - forming galaxies .",
    "the lower panels of figure  [ fig : smdist ] show @xmath148 in the coarse - grained resolution of @xmath160 .",
    "the high @xmath148 regions show @xmath161 mk .",
    "in such an angular resolution , the sensitivity with 16 antennas of alma is @xmath162 mk by @xmath163 minute integration .",
    "if an early star - forming galaxy is observed , some beams may detect sub - mm flux by the integration of less than 1 hour .",
    "thus , the detection of clumpy sub - mm features of an early star - forming galaxy seems feasible .",

    "<S> consequently , the dust temperature decreases with the evolutionary time , where the mass - weighted mean temperature is @xmath5 at @xmath6 0.1 gyr and @xmath7 at @xmath6 1.0 gyr . by this analysis , </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the sub - millimeter brightness is higher in the lae phase than that in the lbg phase , although the dust - to - gas ratio increases monotonically as a function of time . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the spectral energy distributions by placing the model galaxy at a given redshift . the peak flux at 850 @xmath8 is found to be @xmath9 mjy if the model galaxy is placed at @xmath10 . </S>",
