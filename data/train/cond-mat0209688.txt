    "this paper provides further insight into the first of the two hohenberg - kohn ( hk ) theorems @xcite that constitute the rigorous mathematical basis for density functional theory . according to the theorem , for a system of @xmath9 electrons in an external field @xmath10 , the * _ ground _ * state electronic density @xmath11 for a nondegenerate state determines the external potential energy @xmath12 uniquely to within an _ * unknown trivial additive constant * _ @xmath5 . since the kinetic energy @xmath13 and electronic - interaction potential energy @xmath14 operators are known , the hamiltonian @xmath15 is explicitly known .",
    "the solutions @xmath16 of the corresponding time - independent schrdinger equation , for both ground and excited states , then determine the properties of the electronic system .",
    "the wave function is thus a functional of the density : @xmath17 $ ] , and therefore all expectations are unique functionals of the density .",
    "thus , the ground state density @xmath1 determines _ * all * _ the properties of the system .",
    "+ in the extension of the first hk theorem to the time - dependent case , runge and gross(rg ) @xcite prove that for a system of @xmath9 electrons in a time - dependent external field @xmath18 , such that the potential energy @xmath19 is taylor- expandable about some initial time @xmath20 , the density @xmath21 evolving from some fixed initial state @xmath22 , determines the external potential energy uniquely to within an _ * additive purely time - dependent function * _ @xmath6 .",
    "again , as the kinetic and electron - interaction potential energy operators are already defined , the hamiltonian @xmath23 is known .",
    "the solution @xmath24 of the time - dependent schrdinger equation then determines the system properties .",
    "equivalently , the wave function @xmath24 is a functional of the density , unique to within a time - dependent phase .",
    "as such all expectation values are unique functionals of the density , the phase factor cancelling out .",
    "+ in the preamble to their proof , hk / rg consider hamiltonians @xmath4 that differ by an additive constant @xmath5/function @xmath6 to be equivalent . in other words ,",
    "the _ * physical system * _ under consideration as defined by the electronic hamiltonian remains the _ * same * _ on addition of this constant / function which is _ * arbitrary*_. thus , measurement of properties of the system , other than for example the total energy @xmath25 , remain invariant .",
    "the theorem then proves that _ * each * _ density @xmath26 is associated with _ * one * _ and _ * only one * _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath4 or physical system : the density @xmath27 determines that unique hamiltonian @xmath4 to within an additive constant @xmath5/function @xmath6 .",
    "+ hk / rg , however , did not consider the case of a set of hamiltonians @xmath28 that represent _ * different * _ physical systems which differ by an _ * intrinsic * _ constant @xmath5/function @xmath6 , but which yet have the * _ same _ * density @xmath29 . by intrinsic constant @xmath5/function @xmath6 we mean one that is inherent to the system and not extrinsically additive .",
    "thus , this constant @xmath5/function @xmath6 helps distinguish between the different hamiltonians in the set @xmath28 , and is consequently _ * not arbitrary*_. that the physical systems are _ * different * _ could , of course , be confirmed by experiment .",
    "further , the density @xmath29 would then not be able to distinguish between the different hamiltonians @xmath8 or physical systems , as it is the same for all of them .",
    "+ in this paper we construct a _ * set * _ of model systems with _ * different * _ hamiltonians @xmath8 that differ by a constant @xmath5/function @xmath6 but which _ * all * _ possess the same density @xmath29 .",
    "this is the hooke s species : atom , molecule , all positive molecular ions with number of nuclei @xmath30 greater than two .",
    "the constants @xmath5/function @xmath6 contain information about the system , and are intrinsic to distinguishing between the different elements of the species .",
    "+ the corollary to the hk / rg theorem is as follows : degenerate hamiltonians @xmath28 that differ by a constant @xmath5/function @xmath6 but which represent different physical systems all possessing the same density @xmath27 can not be distinguished on the basis of the hk / rg theorem .",
    "that is , for such systems , the density @xmath27 can not determine each external potential energy @xmath31 , and hence each hamiltonian of the set @xmath32 , uniquely .",
    "+ in the following sections , we describe the hooke s species for the time - independent and time - dependent cases to prove the above corollary .",
    "* a*.  * time - independent case*. + prior to describing the hooke s species , let us consider the following coulomb species of two - electron systems and @xmath30 nuclei : the helium atom ( @xmath33 ; atomic number @xmath34 ) , the hydrogen molecule ( @xmath35 ; atomic number of each nuclei @xmath36 ) , and the positive molecular ions ( @xmath37 ; atomic number of each nuclei @xmath36 ) .",
    "+ in atomic units , the hamiltonian of the coulomb species is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the kinetic energy operator : @xmath40 @xmath41 the electron - interaction potential energy operator : @xmath42 and @xmath43 the external potential energy operator : @xmath44 with @xmath45 where @xmath46 here @xmath47 and @xmath48 are positions of the electrons , @xmath49 the positions of the nuclei , and @xmath50 the coulomb external potential energy function .",
    "each element of the coulomb species represents a _ * different * _ physical system .",
    "( the species could be further generalized by requiring each nuclei to have a different charge . ) + now suppose the ground state density @xmath51 of the hydrogen molecule were known .",
    "then , according to the hk theorem , this density uniquely determines the external potential energy operator to within an additive constant @xmath5 : @xmath52 thus , the hamiltonian of the hydrogen molecule is exactly known from the ground state density .",
    "note that in addition to the functional form of the external potential energy , the density also explicitly defines the positions @xmath53 and @xmath54 of the nuclei .",
    "+ the fact that the ground state density determines the external potential energy operator , and hence the hamiltonian may be understood as follows .",
    "integration of the density leads to the number @xmath9 of the electrons : @xmath55 .",
    "the cusps in the electron density which satisfies the electron - nucleus cusp condition @xcite , determine in turn the positions of the @xmath30 nuclei and their charge @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the external potential energy operator @xmath57 , and therefore the hamiltonian @xmath58 are known .",
    "+ the hooke s species comprise of two electrons coupled harmonically to a variable number @xmath30 of nuclei .",
    "the electrons are coupled to each nuclei with a different spring constants @xmath59 .",
    "the species comprise of the hooke s atom ( @xmath33 , atomic number @xmath34 , spring constant k ) , the hooke s molecule ( @xmath35 ; atomic number of each nuclei @xmath36 , spring constants @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) , and the hooke s positive molecular ions ( @xmath37 , atomic number of each nuclei @xmath36 , spring constants @xmath62 ) . the hamiltonian @xmath63 of this species is the same as that of the coulomb species of eq.(1 ) except that the external potential energy function is @xmath64 , where @xmath65 just as for the coulomb species , each element of the hooke s species represents a * _ different _ * physical system .",
    "thus , for example , the hamiltonian for hooke s atom is @xmath66,\\ ] ] and that of hooke s molecule is @xmath67+k_{2 } [      ( { \\bf r}_{1}-{\\bf r}_{2})^{2}+({\\bf r}_{2}-{\\bf r}_{2})^{2}]\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath68 , and so on for the various hooke s positive molecular ions with @xmath37 . + for the hooke",
    "s species , however , the external potential energy operator @xmath69 which is @xmath70,\\ ] ] may be rewritten as @xmath71+c(\\{k\\},\\ { { \\bf r } \\},\\mathcal{n}),\\ ] ] where the translation vector @xmath72 is @xmath73 and the constant @xmath5 is @xmath74 with @xmath75 @xmath76 or @xmath77 from eq.(12 ) it is evident that the hamiltonians @xmath78 of the hooke s species are those of a hooke s atom ( @xmath79 ) , ( to within a constant @xmath80 ) , whose center of mass is at @xmath72 . the constant @xmath5 which depends upon the spring constants @xmath81 , the positions of the nuclei @xmath82 , and the number @xmath30 of the nuclei , differs from a trivial additive constant in that it is an _ * intrinsic * _ part of _ * each * _ hamiltonian @xmath78 , and distinguishes between the different elements of the species .",
    "it does so because the constant @xmath83 contains physical information about the system such as the positions @xmath84 of the nuclei .",
    "+ now according to the hk theorem , the ground state density determines the external potential energy , and hence the hamiltonian , to within a constant . since the density of _",
    "* each * _ element of the hooke s species is that of the hooke s atom , it can only determine the hamiltonian of a hooke s atom and not the constant @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , it can not determine the hamiltonian @xmath78 for @xmath85 .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the density of the elements of the hooke s species does not satisfy the electron - nucleus cusp condition .",
    "( it is emphasized that although the ` degenerate hamiltonians ' of the hooke s species have a ground state wave function and density that corresponds to that of a hooke s atom , each element of the species represents a _ * different * _ physical system .",
    "thus , for example , a neutron diffraction experiment on the hooke s molecule and hooke s positive molecular ion would _",
    "* all * _ give different results ) .",
    "+ it is also possible to construct a hooke s species such that the density of each element is the _ * same*_. this is most readily seen for the case when the center of mass is moved to the origin of the coordinate system , i.e. for @xmath86 .",
    "this requires , from eq.(13 ) , the product of the spring constants and the coordinates of the nuclei satisfy the condition @xmath87 so that the external potential energy operator is then @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the distance to the origin . if the sum @xmath90 is then adjusted to equal a particluar value of the spring constant @xmath91 of hooke s atom : @xmath92 then the hamiltonian @xmath78 of any element of the species may be rewritten as @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the hooke s atom hamiltonian and the constant @xmath83 is @xmath95 the solution of the schrdinger equation and the corresponding density for _ * each * _ element of the species are therefore the _ * same*_. + as an example , again consider the case of hooke s atom and molecule . for hooke s atom @xmath96 , and let us assume @xmath97 .",
    "thus , the external potential energy operator is @xmath98 for this choice of @xmath91 , the singlet ground state solution of the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath99 is analytical @xcite : @xmath100 where @xmath101 , and @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding ground state density @xmath103 , @xmath104 is @xcite @xmath105 where @xmath106 for the hooke s molecule , @xmath107 , and we choose @xmath108 , so that the external potential energy operator is @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian for hooke s molecule differs from that of hooke s atom by only the constant @xmath111 , thereby leading to the _ * same * _ ground state wave function and density .",
    "however , the ground state energy of the two elements of the species differ by @xmath112 .",
    "+ the above example demonstrating the equivalence of the density of the hooke s atom and molecule is for a specific value of the spring constant @xmath91 for which the wave function happens to be analytical .",
    "however , this conclusion is valid for arbitrary value of @xmath91 for which solutions of the schrdinger equation exist but are not necessarily analytical .",
    "for example , if we assume that for each element of the species ( @xmath113 ) , all the spring constants @xmath114 are the same and designated by @xmath115 , then for the three values of @xmath91 for the hooke s atom corresponding to @xmath116 , the values of @xmath115 for which the hooke s molecule and molecular ion ( @xmath117 ) wave functions are the same are @xmath118 , respectively .",
    "+ thus , for the case where the elements of the hooke s species are all made to have the _ * same * _ ground state density @xmath51 , the density can not , on the basis of the hk theorem , distinguish bewteen the different physical elements of the species .",
    "+ _ * corollary * _ : degenerate time - independent hamiltonians @xmath119 that represent different physical systems , but which differ by a constant @xmath5 , and yet possess the same density @xmath51 , can not be distinguished on the basis of the hohenberg - kohn theorem .    * b*.   * time - dependent case*. + we next extend the above conclusions to the time - dependent hk theorem .",
    "consider again the hooke s species , but in this case let us assume that the positions of the nuclei are time - dependent , i.e. @xmath120 .",
    "this could represent , for example , the zero point motion of the nuclei . for simplicity",
    "we consider the spring constant strength to be the same ( @xmath115 ) for interaction with all the nuclei .",
    "the external potential energy @xmath121 for an arbitrary member of the species which now is @xmath122 may then be rewritten as @xmath123 where at some initial time @xmath20 , we have @xmath124 .",
    "( note that a spatially uniform time - dependent field @xmath125 interacting only with the electrons could be further incorporated by adding a term @xmath126 to the external potential energy expression . )",
    "the hamiltonian of an element of the species governed by the number of nuclei @xmath30 is then @xmath127\\cdot ( { \\bf     r}_{1}+ { \\bf r}_{2 } ) + c(k',\\mathcal{n},t),\\ ] ] where @xmath128 is the time - independent hooke s species hamiltonian eq.(21 ) : @xmath129 and the time - dependent function @xmath130.\\ ] ] note that the function @xmath131 contains physical information about the system : in this case , about the motion of the nuclei about their equilibrium positions .",
    "it also differentiates between the different elements of the species .",
    "+ the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation@xmath132 employing the harmonic potential theorem @xcite is @xmath133 \\psi_{0 } ( \\overline{{\\bf   r}_{1 } } \\;\\overline{{\\bf r}_{2}}),\\ ] ] where @xmath134 , @xmath135 dt',\\ ] ] the shift @xmath136 satisfies the classical harmonic oscillator equation @xmath137=0,\\ ] ] where the additional phase factor @xmath138 is due to the function @xmath131 , @xmath139 and where at the initial time @xmath140 which satisfies @xmath141 .",
    "thus , the wave function @xmath142 is the time - independent solution shifted by a time - dependent function @xmath136 , and multiplied by a phase factor .",
    "the explicit contribution of the function @xmath131 to this phase has been separated out .",
    "the phase factor cancels out in the determination of the density @xmath143 which is the initial time - independent density @xmath144 displaced by @xmath136 . + as in the time - independent case , the ` degenerate hamiltonians ' @xmath145 of the time - dependent hooke s species can each be made to generate the _ * same * _ density @xmath2 by adjusting the spring constant @xmath115 such that @xmath146 , and provided the density at the initial time @xmath20 is the _ * same*_. the latter is readily achieved as it constitues the time - independent hooke s species case discussed previously .",
    "+ thus , we have a set of hamiltonians describing different physical systems but which can be made to generate the same density @xmath147 .",
    "these hamiltonians differ by the function @xmath131 that contains information which differentiates between them . in such a case , the density @xmath147 can not distinguish between the different hamiltonians .",
    "+ _ * corollary * _ : degenerate time - dependent hamiltonians @xmath148 that represent different physical systems , but which differ by a purely time - dependent function @xmath6 , and which all yield the same density @xmath149 , can not be distinguished on the basis of the runge - gross theorem . +",
    "the proof of the hk theorem is general in that it is valid for _ * arbitrary * _ local form ( coulombic , harmonic , yukawa , oscillatory , etc . ) of external potential energy @xmath150 .",
    "( in the time - dependent case , there is the restriction that @xmath151 must be taylor - expandable about some initial time @xmath20 . ) for their proof , hk / rg considered the case of potential energies , and hence hamiltonians , that differ by an additive constant @xmath5/function @xmath6 to be equivalent : @xmath152 by equivalent is meant that the density @xmath153 is the same .",
    "the fact that the constant @xmath5/function @xmath6 is _ * additive * _ means that although the hamiltonians differ , the physical system , however remains the _",
    "* same*_. the theorem then shows that there is a one - to - one correspondence between a physical system ( as described by all these equivalent hamiltonians ) , and the corresponding density @xmath154 .",
    "the relationship between the basic hamiltonian @xmath155 describing a particular system and the density @xmath7 is bijective or fully invertible .",
    "this case considered by hk / rg is shown schematically in fig . 1 in which the invertibility is indicated by the double - headed arrow .",
    "+      the case of a set of degenerate hamiltonians @xmath156 that differ by a constant @xmath5/function @xmath6 that is _ * intrinsic * _ such that the hamiltonians represent _ * different * _ physical systems while yet * _ all _ * possessing the same density @xmath157 , was not considered by hk / rg . in such a case , the density _ * can not * _ uniquely determine the hamiltonian , and therefore _ * can not * _ differentiate between the different physical systems .",
    "this case , also shown schematically in fig.1 , corresponds to the hooke s species .",
    "the relationship between the set of hamiltonians @xmath158 and the density @xmath159 which is not invertible is indicated by the single - headed arrow . + we conclude by noting that the hooke s species , in both the time - independent and time - dependent cases , does not contitute a counter example to the hk / rg theorem .",
    "the reason for this is that the proof of the hk / rg theorem is _ * independent * _ of whether the constant @xmath5/ function @xmath6 is additive or intrinsic .",
