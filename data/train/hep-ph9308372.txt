    "<S> are displayed as functions for transverse momentum ( @xmath8 ) for selected values of feynman @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we provide simple analytic parametrizations of our theoretical predictions that should make our results easy to use in studies of expected acceptances and efficiencies of proposed new detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical computations are based on next - to - leading order qcd hard - scattering cross sections@xmath9 and the latest two - loop evolved parton densities obtained from a global fit of data from deep - inelastic lepton scattering and other reactions@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the work presented here is an update of an earlier publication@xmath11 to which we refer for the theoretical formalism and summary of its limitations .    </S>",
    "<S> the heavy quark inclusive cross section in perturbative qcd is obtained as a convolution of parton densities @xmath12 with a hard - scattering cross section @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the heavy quark mass is @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the square of the parton - parton center - of - mass energy , @xmath16 ; and @xmath17 is the renormalization / factorization scale that serves to separate long- and short - distance effects . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 for the total cross sections reported here and for the cross sections differential in @xmath8 , we use the scale choice @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt @xmath20gev . </S>",
    "<S> poor knowledge of the gluon density is a principal source of uncertainty for predictions of bottom quark cross sections at collider energies . in earlier work </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that measurements of the bottom quark cross sections by the cern ua1 and fnal cdf collaborations provide valuable constraints on the gluon density at intermediate values of bjorken @xmath21@xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> for lhc and ssc energies , the values of @xmath21 of interest extend over the range @xmath23 to @xmath24 , or so . to explore the uncertainties associated with relative ignorance of the gluon density in this range , we adopt for part of our study the  singular \" and  regular \" gluon density parametrizations of the mrs collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> these are denoted , respectively , mrs @xmath25 and mrs @xmath26 .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we show calculations of the inclusive cross section @xmath27 obtained from an integration of the inclusive yield over all rapidity and transverse momentum . for the energy range @xmath28 shown in fig .  1 ( a ) , the singular and regular parametrizations of the gluon density yield similar results . </S>",
    "<S> the differences become increasingly significant as @xmath1 increases above @xmath29 , as shown in fig .  1 ( b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath30 proton beam incident on a fixed proton target provides a center - of - mass energy @xmath31 . for this ssc fixed - target option </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate @xmath32 for the singular set @xmath25 and @xmath33 for the regular set @xmath26 . including uncertainties associated with variations of the choice of scale @xmath17 and b quark mass @xmath34 </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate @xmath35    at @xmath36 , the calculations yield @xmath37 for set @xmath26 and nearly @xmath38 for set @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> however , at this energy , gluon resummation effects@xmath39 are expected to be very significant , providing enhancement factors@xmath39 of @xmath40 for a regular gluon starting distribution @xmath41 constant ) and @xmath42 for a singular distribution @xmath43 . using these factors </S>",
    "<S> , we may multiply our @xmath44 results at @xmath36 , obtaining @xmath45 for set @xmath25 and @xmath46 for set @xmath26 . including estimates of other uncertainties , we quote @xmath47 similar reasoning leads to an estimate appropriate at the lhc energy @xmath48 : @xmath49    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , we present the qcd order @xmath50 differential cross section @xmath51 as a function of @xmath8 for the ssc collider energy , for three values of feynman @xmath0 . for these results </S>",
    "<S> , we use the regular gluon density mrs @xmath26 . in our earlier paper@xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> , we showed that the influence of the more singular gluon density is felt most strongly at small @xmath8 ( @xmath52 ) at @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical results are shown as the solid curves in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 . notable in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 is the dramatic decrease in the cross section at @xmath54 by more than four orders of magnitude when @xmath0 is increased from 0 . to 0.25 . </S>",
    "<S> comparison of figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ( b ) and 2 ( c ) shows that this large drop is followed by a less remarkable decrease by a factor of 30 or so as @xmath0 is increased from 0.25 to 0.5 . at small @xmath0 and small @xmath8 , the cross section is sensitive to the small @xmath21 behavior of the gluon density . in our previous paper , we provided calculations of rapidity and pseudo - rapidity distributions@xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 may be fitted with a fairly simple analytic expression . </S>",
    "<S> the form we adopted is @xmath55    we treat quantities @xmath56,@xmath57 , and @xmath58 as three free parameters whose values vary with @xmath1 and @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the histograms in fig . 2 show the results of our fits to the theoretical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> fitted values of the three parameters are provided in table i.a . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted value of our parameter @xmath58 is close to the value we used for the physical bottom quark mass @xmath34 in our calculation , to be anticipated since @xmath59 is approximately @xmath34 , but no great significance should be attached to the fact that our fitted @xmath58 varies somewhat with @xmath0 and @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement of the simple fit with the full theoretical calculation should make the fitted expression useful for estimates of rates , acceptances , and efficiencies .    0.25 in    table i.a fitted parameters for @xmath60 for : @xmath61gev at ssc collider energy .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 and table i.b , we provide analogous results for the ssc fixed target energy of @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 dependence is less dramatic at this energy .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 and table i.c , we present results for the lhc collider energy of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 dependence at this energy shows a steep decrease from @xmath0 = 0 to 0.25 , followed by a more gradual decrease from 0.25 to 0.5 , as we saw above at @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> fitted values for the lhc cross section at @xmath64 are provided in table i.d    we acknowledge valuable communications with stanley wojcicki . </S>",
