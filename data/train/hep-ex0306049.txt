    "the search for rare and forbidden decays of charm particles is enticing since standard model ( sm ) predictions for interesting decays tend to be beyond the reach of current experiments , and a signal is an indication of unexpected physics .",
    "standard model predictions @xcite for the branching ratios of rare decays @xmath4 ( with @xmath5 ) are dominated by long range effects which are notoriously difficult to calculate .",
    "even so , the differences between the three predictions in @xcite , although using individual treatments for the decay spectra , are quite manageable .",
    "for example , the predicted integrated rate for @xmath6 varies by only a factor of 2 while the experimental limits are a factor of 510 away . minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "r - parity violating extensions can significantly increase this rate .",
    "experimental results for @xmath2 currently set the best constraint for the product of the mssm r - parity violating couplings : @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "until experiments reach the sm limit for these rare decays , a signal indicates new physics or a needed refinement in the interpretation of the sm .",
    "decays of the form @xmath8 ( with @xmath1 ) are forbidden in the sm since they violate lepton number conservation , and a signal in these modes is direct evidence of new physics .    in this paper , we present new upper limits for the branching ratios of 3-body di - muonic decays of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons mentioned above .",
    "unless specifically mentioned , all results include a lower limit of 0 at the 90% c.l .. our results represent a factor of 1.714 improvement over previous experimental limits @xcite .",
    "the result for the branching ratio upper limits of @xmath11 of @xmath12 90% c.l . and",
    "@xmath13 of @xmath14 90% c.l .",
    "are both within a factor of 5 of the standard model ( long range ) predictions @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16 @xcite respectively .",
    "the result for the branching ratio upper limit @xmath17 of @xmath18 90% c.l .",
    "is below the mssm r - parity violating constraint @xcite .",
    "the data for this analysis were collected using the wideband photoproduction experiment focus during the 19961997 fixed - target run at fermilab .",
    "the focus detector is a large aperture , fixed - target spectrometer with excellent vertexing and particle identification used to measure the interactions of high energy photons on a segmented beo target .",
    "the focus beamline @xcite and detector @xcite have been described elsewhere .",
    "we look for @xmath19 s through the 3-body decay chains @xmath20 ( where the @xmath21 represents a pion or a kaon ) for rare decays and @xmath22 or @xmath23 for normalization ( charge conjugate modes are implied throughout this paper ) . in order to search for the set of cuts that provides signal optimization",
    ", we place initial ( loose ) requirements on the reconstructed data to produce a base sample , and then we place a series of ( tighter ) cuts on the base sample .",
    "the loose requirements consist of acceptance , momentum , vertexing , and particle identification cuts .",
    "note that for all cuts , care is taken to ensure that the normalization modes receive the same cuts as the di - muon modes where possible .    due to the finite lifetime and lorentz boost of charm candidates , the primary interaction vertex and secondary decay vertex can have a significant separation along the beam direction .",
    "secondary vertices are formed from 3 candidate tracks , and the resulting momentum vector of the 3 tracks is used as a seed to search for a primary vertex @xcite .",
    "we require that the confidence level of the secondary vertex fit ( dcl ) exceed 1% , the confidence level of the primary vertex fit exceed 1% , the significance of separation between the primary and secondary vertices ( @xmath24 ) exceed 5 , and the confidence level that any of the secondary tracks is consistent with the primary vertex ( iso1 ) be less than 10% .",
    "the latter cut is included to remove the contamination from @xmath25 decays and other tracks originating from the primary that could be confused with secondary tracks .",
    "we use the erenkov system @xcite to identify pions and kaons . for each track , @xmath26 is computed , where @xmath27 is the likelihood that a track is consistent with a given particle hypothesis . for a candidate kaon ,",
    "we require @xmath28 ( kaonicity ) be greater than 0.5 . for a candidate pion in a rare mode , we require @xmath29 ( pionicity )",
    "be greater than -15 .",
    "muon candidates are required to be within the acceptance of either of the 2 muon systems in focus @xcite .",
    "we require the tracks in a normalizing mode corresponding to muon tracks in a rare decay mode be in the acceptance of one of the muon systems as well . since the rate of muon misidentification increases at low momentum , we place a requirement that the momentum of `` muon '' tracks within the acceptance of the wide angle ( outer ) muon system ( @xmath30 ) be greater than @xmath31 and those within the low angle ( inner ) muon system ( @xmath32 ) be greater than @xmath33 .",
    "all muon candidates are required to have associated hits in either muon system sufficient to meet a minimum confidence level , @xmath34 , of 1% for the muon hypothesis , and must pass additional muon cuts depending on the system traversed . for the outer muon system , muon candidates must traverse a minimum of 150 cm of material , produce hits in 2 of 3 planes of the detector , and these 2 ( or more ) hits ( called a cluster ) must not be shared by the other muon candidate . for the inner system ,",
    "at least 4 of 6 planes of the detector must record hits consistent with the candidate track , no more than 2 of these hits can be shared with the other candidate muon track , and a fit to the hypothesis that the inner muon candidate track had the same measured momentum in both magnets traversed was required to exceed 1% .",
    "this last cut is used to reduce contamination from particles that decay and produce a muon as they traverse the spectrometer .",
    "this cut is also applied to the pions in the normalization modes , and the lowest momentum kaon , when possible , for the @xmath10 normalization mode .",
    "finally , all other tracks in the event are fit to the muon hypothesis using the hits from a candidate muon , and the highest confidence level from the fits , iso@xmath35 , is saved .",
    "no iso@xmath35 cut was required for the base sample , but a @xmath36 iso@xmath35 is included in the set of cuts used for sensitivity optimization .    for the @xmath10 normalization signal , @xmath37 , a cut was applied to reduce the reflection when one of the pions from @xmath38 is misidentified as a kaon . under the hypothesis",
    "that the same sign @xmath10 kaon track is assumed to be pion , the invariant mass is calculated . if the new invariant mass is within 3 standard deviations of the @xmath9 mass , the kaonicity of the same sign kaon must exceed 6 .",
    "additionally , we require that the reconstructed @xmath39 invariant mass be within 3 standard deviations of the @xmath40 mass .",
    "our analysis methodology ( section 3 ) requires a base sample of events of sufficiently small size ( 150 events ) for a reasonable processing time .",
    "base samples were obtained by applying the minimum @xmath24 cut in the range of 5 to 8 which brought the sample size below 150 .",
    "the series of cuts applied to these samples was arranged into a grid .",
    "this cut grid was based on kinematic variables , particle i d algorithm results , vertex quality , and event topology .",
    "for example , once the lower cut in @xmath24 was determined , the @xmath24 cut was allowed to vary in steps of 2 units up to a maximum of 21 or 22 .",
    "the cuts used have been shown to be effective for other charm decays besides those presented in this analysis .",
    "since the kaonicity cut can be applied to the kaon modes identically , there is an inherent increase in the size of the cut grid when the pionicity cut is used for the pion modes . to keep the size of the cut grid roughly the same , and to prevent memory overflows in software that was difficult to modify ,",
    "we reduced the size of the cut grid for the pion modes .",
    "the grid ( see table [ tab : cuts ] ) includes cuts on @xmath24 , iso1 , dcl , kaonicity , pionicity , @xmath34 , iso@xmath35 , and the momentum of muon candidates .",
    "the normalizing modes used to compute the branching ratios for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are shown in figure [ fig : norm ] for the loosest cuts in the grid .",
    ".analysis cuts used in the cut grid .",
    "variables are described in the text .",
    "the best cut on average represents a point on the cut grid used in a systematic check of our result that is described in the `` systematic checks and results '' section of the paper .",
    "cuts indicated by @xmath43 are applied only to the kaon modes to keep the cut grid about the same size for kaon and pion modes .",
    "notice that the cuts removed for the pion modes are chosen either very far from the `` best cut '' ( explained later in the text ) , or represent a small reduction in the stepping of a cut that varies logarithmically ( iso1 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the focus results from this analysis are shown in comparison to previous best results and recent theory in table [ tab : res ] .",
    "our results are a substantial improvement over previous results @xcite and the focus result for the branching ratio upper limit @xmath17 of @xmath18 90% c.l . is lower than the current mssm r - parity violating constraint @xcite for this mode .",
