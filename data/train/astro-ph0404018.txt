    "sax j2103.5 + 4545 is a transient hmxrb pulsar with a @xmath0358  s pulse period discovered with the wfc on - board bepposax during an outburst in 1997 ( hulleman et al . , 1998 ) .",

    "baykal et al . (",

    "indeed , the source underwent a spin - up phase during the initial part of the outburst ( during which the pulse period decreased by @xmath00.9  s in 150  days ) , then the flux dropped ( and the pulse frequency saturated ) , and , as the flux continued to decline , a weak spin - down phase started . moreover , a correlation between spin - up rate and x  ray flux was observed ( baykal et al . , 2002 ) , suggestive of the formation of an accretion disk during the periastron passage .",
