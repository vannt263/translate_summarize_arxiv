    "in this paper we study classical diffusion in the presence of advection by a random , time - independent flow field , with an emphasis on spectral properties of the corresponding fokker - planck operator .",
    "our motivation is two - fold .",
    "first , the mathematical problem of calculating the properties of a random , non - hermitian differential operator is interesting in its own right , and , as far as we know , has received little attention until recently .",
    "second , spectral decomposition is a natural approach for investigating the diffusion - advection problem . amongst other things ,",
    "the spectrum contains information about the time - dependence of the effective diffusivity , and our results in fact reveal a short - time regime which appears not previously to have been discussed .",
    "diffusion - advection problems can arise in a variety of physical settings , including turbulent diffusion of tracer particles in geological systems , the temperature field in rayleigh - bnard convection , and flow through porous media ; an extensive review is provided in the article by isichenko@xcite . the interplay between advection and diffusion may either greatly enhance or strongly inhibit the long - time transport of particles , depending on the nature of the flow field . broadly speaking ,",
    "compressible flows inhibit transport , since fluid sinks at which flow lines converge will act as particle traps , while incompressible flows transport particles more effectively at long times than diffusion alone . in either case , the effective diffusivity provides a macroscopic measure of the combined consequences of molecular diffusion and of advection .",
    "diffusion - advection problems have long been a subject of research in fluid dynamics .",
    "early work dates back to that of taylor @xcite and of richardson @xcite , who proposed the notion of effective diffusivity .",
    "subsequently , batchelor analyzed one - point and two - point correlations in homogeneous turbulence , relating the diffusion coefficient to the temporal correlation of the velocities @xcite .",
    "recently , much analytic progress has been made in a special model considered by kraichnan @xcite , in which the velocity field is zero - mean gaussian distributed and delta correlated in time , a special case for which the closure problem is absent .",
    "in contrast , our interest in the following is in flow fields that are time - independent .",
    "the effect of various forms of time - independent spatial disorder on classical diffusion has attracted considerable attention from statistical physicists , especially following the proof by sinai that a type of random advection in one dimension results in dramatically sub - diffusive motion at long times @xcite .",
    "several groups of authors @xcite have investigated scaling in these systems , particularly within the framework of renormalization group theory .",
    "behavior is dependent on dimensionality , and long - time motion is diffusive only above an upper critical dimension , which is two if the advecting velocity field has only short - range correlations .",
    "while the focus of that work , reviewed in refs.@xcite has been long times and systems at or below the upper critical dimension , we restrict ourselves in the following to systems above the upper critical dimension , and consider transient as well as long - time behaviour .",
    "in addition to the study of diffusion - advection problems as critical phenomena , many rigorous results , providing bounds on the effective diffusivity and on the limiting behavior at long times , have been proved by mathematicians using the methods of multiscale analysis and variational principles@xcite .    against the background of this varied literature",
    ", it is perhaps suprising that little seems to have been known until recently about spectral properties of the fokker - planck operator for random diffusion - advection problems , even though the corresponding aspects of random schrdinger operators have been studied very extensively .",
    "in fact , the spectrum of the fokker - planck operator depends very much on the nature of the velocity field responsible for advection . in general",
    ", this velocity field can be separated into an incompressible ( divergence - free ) part , and a remainder , which can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential .",
    "pure potential flow is a special case of some importance , especially since in one dimension any velocity field can be written in terms of a scalar potential . in this special case",
    "the fokker - planck operator is related by similarity transformation to a hermitian operator @xcite , and therefore has a purely real spectrum .",
    "some previous work has built on this transformation , showing that anomolous diffusion at long times in one dimension is connected with a logarithmic singularity of eigenvalue density of the fokker - planck operator @xcite , while other work has been concerned in two dimensions with the opposite limit of purely incompressible flow , analyzing the connection with the quantum random flux problem , and studying numerically the spatial decay of the green function @xcite .",
    "more generally , as we show , the non - hermitian nature of the fokker - planck operator is an obstacle that prevents one from transferring in a straightforward way the techniques developed for random schrdinger operators . for an unrestricted flow field , one expects eigenvalues of the fokker - planck operator to occupy a finite area of the complex plane . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding green function is non - analytic throughout this area , and established perturbative approaches to calculating disorder - averaged green functions , which depend on analytic continuation , are inapplicable .",
    "this difficulty has been faced previously in the study of certain ensembles of non - hermitian random matrices , for which the eigenvalues are known to be distributed uniformly within a circle in the complex plane @xcite . for these ensembles , special techniques have been developed @xcite , which do not generalise immediately to spatially extended problems such as the one we are concerned with .",
    "recently , several groups independently @xcite have found that one can make progress by constructing , from the non - hermitian operator of interest , a hermitian operator with a @xmath2 block structure , and applying standard methods to this enlarged hermitian operator .",
    "we describe this approach below , and apply it to the fokker - planck operator , treating the advection term as a perturbation to the diffusion term , a limit is known in the fluid dynamics as the small pclet number regime .    the general method described here",
    "might be applied to variety of problems involving random non - hermitian operators in which behavior at weak disorder is of interest .",
    "a number of such problems have attracted recent attention , including asymmetric neural networks @xcite and the statistical mechanics of flux lines in superconductors with columnar disorder @xcite , and the schrdinger equation for particles moving in a random imaginary scalar potential @xcite .",
    "recently , building on the formalism outlined in sec.ii , useful links have been established between @xcite problems of this kind and certain hermitian localization problems .",
    "the present paper provides a detailed account of work presented previously in outline elsewhere @xcite .",
    "in particular , we describe for the first time calculations for a random flow field with arbitrary relative strength to the compressible and incompressible components .",
    "the remaining sections are organised as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we define the problem and outline the green function approach used in our calculations . in sec.iii",
    "we apply this approach to the fokker - planck operator for the diffusion - advection problem with a random velocity field .",
    "we obtain the green function for the fokker - planck operator , and its eigenvalue density in the complex plane .",
    "we describe numerical tests of our results in sec.iv , and present some technical details in two appendices .",
    "particles that move by a combination of diffusion and advection have a density , @xmath3 , which is a function of time , @xmath4 , and position , @xmath5 , and evolves according to the fokker - planck equation = l_fp(n ) d ^2 n - ( n ) , [ fp - eq ] where @xmath6 is the molecular diffusivity , and @xmath7 is the background velocity field , which we take to be time - independent and random . for definiteness , we apply periodic boundary conditions to @xmath8 at the surface of a @xmath9-dimensional cube of volume @xmath10 , but treat in detail only the limit @xmath11 .",
    "the fokker - planck operator , @xmath12 , is a sum of two contributions : the diffusion term , @xmath13 , is hermitian , while the advection term , @xmath14 , is not , and our attention throughout this paper is focused on their combined effects on the properties of @xmath12 as a _ random , non - hermitian _ operator .    our choice for the probability distribution of the velocity field",
    "is intended to be the simplest : we take it to be gaussian with zero mean , and with correlations of @xmath15 that are as short - range as possible .",
    "it is specified by the variance v_()v_()&= & _ 1 ( _ - ) ( +  ) + & + & _ 2 ( ) ( +  ) , [ eq - gamma ] where ( ) & = & ( 2)^-d d^de^-i ( ) , @xmath16 indicates an ensemble average , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the strengths of the incompressible and irrotational parts of the velocity field , respectively . for the diffusion - advection problem to be well - defined ,",
    "it is necessary to impose a short - wavelength cut - off , @xmath19 , on the spectrum of velocity fluctuations , so that eq.([eq - gamma ] ) is supplanted by @xmath20 for @xmath21 . a dimensionless measure of the disorder strength involves a frequency scale , which we denote by @xmath22 : @xmath23 is the ratio , raised to the power @xmath24 , of the distances travelled by a particle due to advection and to diffusion , in time @xmath25 . the fact that @xmath26 identifies @xmath27 as the upper critical dimension for the problem : in dimension @xmath0 , as @xmath28 , @xmath29 and one expects the long - time behaviour simply to be diffusive , while for @xmath30",
    ", @xmath31 diverges as @xmath28 , and long - time behaviour is dominated by advection .",
    "we restrict our discussion in this paper to the regime above the upper critical dimension .    our calculations center on the disorder - averaged one - particle green function , which in the position - space and time domain is @xmath32 , where @xmath8 satisfies eq.([fp - eq ] ) with initial condition @xmath33 .",
    "we obtain this from its laplace transform , g ( ) = , in which @xmath22 , in general complex , is the transform variable conjugate to @xmath4 .",
    "it is useful to display the spectral decomposition of both these green functions .",

    "both @xmath44 and @xmath45 can be calculated from the green function using the identity ( -)= [ eq - rho ] with the notation @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath48 real .",
    "the eigenvalue density will turn out to be non - zero over a finite area of the complex @xmath22 plane , and not just on the real axis as would be the case if @xmath12 were hermitian .",
    "standard methods @xcite for calculating average green functions for random hermitian operators make extensive use of the fact that they are analytic in the complex @xmath22-plane , except on the real axis . by contrast , @xmath40 is non - analytic throughout the ( as yet unknown ) area of the complex @xmath22 plane in which @xmath49 is non - zero .",
    "because of this , a new approach is required .",
    "we first embed the original non - hermitian operator , in the combination @xmath50 , in a hermitian operator @xmath51 which has twice the dimension of @xmath52 , setting = h_0 + h_1  , where @xcite _ 0 =(    cc 0 + 0 - +    ) _ 1 =(    cc 0 + a^ 0 +    ) .",

    "note that the desired green function is obtained using @xmath54 .",
