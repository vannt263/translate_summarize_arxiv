    "a _ metric graph _ @xmath0 is by definition a topological graph ( i.e. , a cw  complex of dimension @xmath1 ) , where each edge @xmath2 is assigned a length @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting metric measure space allows to introduce a family of ordinary differential operators acting on each edge @xmath2 considered as interval @xmath4 with boundary conditions at the vertices making the global operator self - adjoint .",
    "one also refers to the pair of the graph and the self - adjoint differential operator as _ quantum graph_.    quantum graphs are playing an intermediate role between difference operators on discrete graphs and partial differential operators on manifolds . on the one hand",
    ", they are a good approximation of partial differential operators on manifolds or open sets close to the graph , see section  [ sec : mfd ] . on the other hand , solving a system of odes reduces in many cases to a discrete problem on the combinatorial graph , see section  [ sec : rel.dg.mg ] .",
    "the spectral relation between metric and ( generalised ) discrete laplacians has the simplest form if the graph is _ equilateral _ , i.e. , if all lengths are the same , say , @xmath5 . this fact and related results",
    "have already been observed by many authors ( see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein ) . moreover , for non - equilateral graphs , one has at least a spectral relation at the bottom of the spectrum . in particular , one can define an _ index _ ( the fredholm index of a generalised `` exterior derivative '' in the discrete and metric case ) and show that they agree ( theorem  [ thm : index ] ) .",
    "the result extends the well - known fact that the index equals the euler characteristic for standard graphs .",
    "such index formulas have been discussed e.g.in  @xcite . for convergence results of a sequence of discrete laplacians towards a metric graph laplacian",
    ", we refer to  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "spectral graph theory is an active area of research .",
    "we do not attempt to give a complete overview here , and the choice of the selected topics depends much on the author s taste .",
    "results on spectral theory of combinatorial laplacians can be found e.g.in  @xcite .",
    "for metric graph laplacians we mention the works  @xcite .",
    "many concepts from spectral geometry on manifolds carry over to metric and discrete graphs , and the right notion for a general scheme would be a metric measure space with a dirichlet form .",
    "in particular , metric graphs fall into this class ; and they can serve as a toy model in order to provide new results in spectral geometry .    this article is organised as follows : in the next section , we define the generalised discrete laplacians . section  [ sec : mg ] is devoted to metric graphs and their associated laplacians . in section  [ sec : rel.dg.mg ] we describe relations between the discrete and metric graph laplacians",
    ". section  [ sec : mfd ] contains the relation of a metric graph with a family of manifolds converging to it .",
    "section  [ sec : cheeger ] is devoted to the study of the first non - zero eigenvalue of the laplacian . in particular , we show cheeger s inequality for the ( standard ) metric graph laplacian .",
    "section  [ sec : trace ] contains material on trace formulas for the heat operator associated to ( general ) metric and discrete graph laplacians .",
    "in particular , we show a `` discrete path integral '' formula for generalised discrete graph laplacians ( cf .  theorem  [ thm : trace.dg ] ) .",
    "let us mention a few aspects which are not included in this article in order to keep it at a reasonable size .",
    "our basic assumption is a lower bound on the edge lengths .",
    "if we drop this condition , we obtain _ fractal _ metric graphs , i.e. , ( infinite ) metric graphs with @xmath6 .",
    "a simple example is given by a rooted tree , where the length @xmath7 of an edge in generation @xmath8 tends to @xmath9 .",
    "new effects occur in this situation : for example , the laplacian on compactly supported functions can have more than one self - adjoint extension ; one needs additional boundary conditions at infinity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "another interesting subject are ( infinite ) covering graphs with finite or compact quotient , for example cayley graphs associated to a finitely generated group .",
    "for example , if the covering group is abelian , one can reduce the spectral theory to a family of problems on the quotient ( with discrete spectrum ) using the so - called _ floquet _ theory .",
    "there are still open questions , for example whether the ( standard ) discrete laplacian of an equilateral maximal abelian covering has full spectrum or not .",
    "this statement is proven if all vertices have even degree ( using an `` euler''-circuit ) .",
    "one can ask whether similar statements hold also for general metric graph laplacians . for more details",
    ", we refer to  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "metric graphs have a further justification : the wave equation associated to the ( standard ) metric graph laplacian has finite propagation speed , in contrast to the corresponding equation for the ( standard ) discrete laplacian ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) for details ) . note that the latter operator is bounded , whereas the metric graph laplacian is unbounded as differential operator .",
    "therefore , one can perform wave equation techniques on metric graphs ( and indeed , this has been done , see for example the scattering approach in  @xcite ) .",
