    "hence the observed long - term spin - down rate of 4u 0142 + 61 is consistent in behavior with the disk fed accreting pulsars .",
    "however , optical limits only allow accretion disks in systems with orbital periods @xmath161  s. orbital periods this small allow only helium main sequence and white dwarf companions at distances of 3 - 5 kpcs and only white dwarf companions at @xmath148 kpc , which are more likely based upon _ rosat _ scattering measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , current evolutionary scenarios do not provide a mechanism for producing a roche lobe filling white dwarf companion or a roche lobe filling helium main sequence companion within the assumed @xmath11  yr age of the system .",
    "this age is based upon the low scale height of axps as a group ( @xcite ) and ages inferred from supernova remnant associations of other axps .",
    "optical , dynamical , and evolutionary limits argue against binarity in axps .",
    "van paradijs et al . (",
    "1995 ) proposed that axps are powered by accretion onto the neutron star from a circumstellar disc resulting from a common envelope evolution .",
    "it is not clear , however , why such an evolution would result in such a narrow range of pulse periods .",
    "the narrow period range is much more easily explained by the magnetar model ( @xcite ) . in this model ,",
    "the neutron star surface is heated by the decay of the very strong magnetic field , producing x - rays .",
    "heyl & hernquist ( 1997 ) also propose a model consisting of a highly magnetized young neutron star surrounded by a thin envelope of hydrogen or helium . in this model ,",
    "x - rays are produced by thermal emission .",
    "pulsations are produced by a temperature gradient on the neutron star s surface induced by the strong magnetic field combined with limb darkening in the neutron star s atmosphere .",
    "detailed long - term monitoring observations of the axps are needed to search for spin - up episodes which would suggest the system is an accretor , or a glitch accompanied by a soft - gamma repeater burst ( @xcite ) , which would suggest the magnetar model .",
