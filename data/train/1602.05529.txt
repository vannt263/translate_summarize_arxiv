    "the properties of the _ fermi _ gbm detection are broadly consistent with a short grb , although it would be significantly harder than the typical @xmath7 - @xmath8 relation for short grbs @xcite .",
    "it is possible that gw150914 produced either an under - luminous short - grb , a poorly collimated jet , or that it is a typical short grb but seen far off - axis , so that the prompt emission directed towards earth was faint .",
    "gw150914 occurred in the southern hemisphere , but was poorly localized , with the combined ligo and _ fermi _ gbm error boxes covering @xmath9  deg@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this made it very difficult to localized the early , rapidly fading x - ray or optical afterglow .",
    "non - detections have been reported by _ swift _",

    "a grb s afterglow produces a persistent source , but is initially self - absorbed , taking weeks to months to reach peak luminosity . the best prospect for finding the afterglow would be with a wide - field instrument , such as the murchinson widefield array ( mwa ) , a low - frequency ( @xmath11 - @xmath12 mhz ) radio array @xcite , or the askap boolardy engineering test array ( beta ) at @xmath13 - @xmath14  mhz @xcite , both located in australia",

    "it would , however , be able to follow up any candidate afterglow sources .    the best way to determine if ligo event gw150914 and the _ fermi _ gbm detection are associated would be to find an afterglow that can be localized to a host galaxy .",
    "we model the possible afterglow of gw150914-gbm as a relativistic blastwave expanding into the surrounding medium , and emitting synchrotron radiation . for a review of afterglow modeling ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics of a grb afterglow are typically modeled either using a semi - analytic solution for an expanding spherical blastwave , or with direct hydrodynamical fluid simulations . since",
    "a grb is typically only detected if the earth is within the jet opening angle , and the outflow is initially highly relativistic , a natural model is a spherical , ultra - relativistic blandford - mckee blastwave @xcite , as in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "more accurate semi - analytic models of spherical and on - axis jet afterglows have also been used , such an an interpolation between a blandford - mckee and sedov - taylow solution in @xcite , and an analytic fit to 1d hydrodynamic simulations in @xcite .",
    "semi - analytic models for an off - axis observer are also possible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these models all assume an ultra - relativistic blandford - mckee blastwave .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of on- and off - axis grb afterglows have been carried out ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although very accurate , full hydrodynamic simulations are computationally expensive and can only be used to directly model a small number of cases .",
    "our modeling approach , described in section  [ sect : code ] , is to use a semi - analytic off - axis blastwave model that smoothly transitions between an ultra - relativistic and non - relativistic expansion , following @xcite . in section  [ sect : results ] we use our afterglow code to make specific predictions for possible afterglow light curves of gw150914 , given a range of possible model parameters . in section  [",
    "sect : conclusions ] we discuss under what conditions an afterglow of gw150914 might be detectable .",
    "we carry out modeling of the afterglow using the trans - relativistic afterglow code ( trac ) .",
    "trac is able to solve a semi - analytic model of the emission of a relativistic fireball with an arbitrary angular distribution of energy and at an arbitrary observer angle ( i.e. relative to a jet axis ) .",
    "trac is based on the methodology of @xcite and began development for use in @xcite .",
    "a full description of trac will be published in morsony et al .",
    "( in prep . )",
    ".    beginning with an energy distribution and observer angle , at a given observer time , trac first calculates the size of the blastwave seen by the observer , along with the values of density , pressure , and lorentz factor inside this shell .",
    "trac treats the evolution along each radial direction from the center of the blast as an independently evolving portion of a spherical blastwave ( no transverse mixing ) .",
    "based on the interpolation of @xcite ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : decolle ] ) , we smoothly transitions between the ultra - relativistic blandford - mckee phase @xcite and the non - relativistic sedov - taylor phase .",
    "this is important for radio observations , which peak during the mildly relativistic transition phase . at any time , the total energy of a spherical blastwave satisfies @xmath24 \\label{eqn : decolle}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the blast energy , @xmath26 is the shock radius , @xmath27 is the lorentz factor of the shock , @xmath28 is the shock velocity over @xmath29 , and , for a constant density external medium , @xmath30 is the external mass density , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "using the 3-dimensional grid of fluid values , trac then computes the integrated emission from the blastwave as a function of frequency . for the current version of trac",
    ", we assume the emission is due to synchrotron radiation parameterized by @xmath33 , the fraction of energy in electrons , @xmath34 , the fraction of energy in the magnetic field , and @xmath35 , the spectral index of the electron energy distribution .",
    "trac solves the radiative transfer equation including local synchrotron cooling and synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "all models considered are in the slow cooling regime . for the models presented here , we assume the shocked gas has an adiabatic index of @xmath36 and that the structure behind the shock front follows that of a relativistic shock , i.e. @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a self - similarity variable , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are density , pressure , and lorentz factor of fluid immediately behind the shock front , and @xmath44 is radius at any position behind the shock . for an impulsive explosion with @xmath31 , @xmath45 .",
    "we also assume that the jet maintains a constant opening angle and does not spread out .",
    "both of these approximations will break down in the non - relativistic limit . in this limit , using a sedov - taylor rather than blandford - mckee internal structure would increase the flux density by up to a factor of 4.5 . allowing the jet to spread",
    "reduces the flux density by a factor of 1.5 to 2 .",
    "the net effect is that our models under - predicts the late - time flux by up to a factor of 2.5 .",
    "for all of our afterglow models , we assume the event is located at @xmath46  mpc , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 the observer - directed kinetic energy is @xmath50  erg , and the blastwave is expanding into a constant density environment ( ism ) .",
