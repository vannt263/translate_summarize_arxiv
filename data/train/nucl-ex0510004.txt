    "quantum chromo  dynamics ( qcd ) is the theory of strong interactions .",
    "lattice calculations of qcd predict that at a critical temperature of @xmath2  mev a phase transition of ordinary nuclear matter to a deconfined state of quarks and gluons occurs  @xcite .",
    "quarks and gluons are not confined in hadrons any more ; they become asymptotically free . under the same conditions ,",
    "chiral symmetry is approximately restored and quark masses are reduced from their large effective values in hadronic matter to their small bare masses .    in",
    "relativistic nuclear collisions , a system with a temperature larger than the critical temperature @xmath3 is expected to be created .",
    "the development of collectivity at the partonic level ( among quarks and gluons ) and the degree of thermalization are closely related to the equation of state of partonic matter : re - scattering among constituents and the density profile lead to the development of collective flow . in case of sufficient re - scattering ,",
    "the system might be able to reach local thermal equilibrium .    in this paper , we show by means of flow measurements of multi - strange baryons that at rhic energies collectivity develops before hadronization , among partons .",
    "we further suggest to measure heavy - flavor ( c , b ) collective flow to probe thermalization of light quarks .",
    "in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions , measured final - state transverse ",
    "momentum spectra can be fit within a hydrodynamically motivated approach , with a kinetic freeze  out temperature @xmath4 and a mean collective flow velocity  as the relevant parameters  @xcite .",
    "figure  1 shows results of those fits from  collisions at = 200  gev at rhic in the @xmath4-  plane .",
    "dashed and solid lines represent 1-@xmath5 and 2-@xmath5 contours , respectively . as the collisions become more and more central , the bulk of the system dominated by the yields of @xmath6 appears to be cooler and develops stronger collective flow , representing a strongly interacting system expansion .",

    "the results for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are numbered from 1  ( most central ) to 9  ( most peripheral )  collisions and p+p collisions  @xcite .",
    "results for the multi - strange hadrons @xmath9 and @xmath10 are shown in the top of for most central  collisions only .",
    "the numbers on the top give the fraction of total hadronic cross section for centrality bins 1 - 9 .",
    "this figure has been taken from  @xcite . ]    at the most central collisions , the temperature parameter and the velocity are @xmath11 mev and @xmath12(c ) , respectively . on the other hand , for the same collision centrality , the multi - strange hadrons @xmath9 and @xmath10 freeze - out at a higher temperature @xmath13mev , close to the point at which chemical freeze - out occurs @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior was also observed in  collisions at = 130 gev @xcite .",
    "multi - strange hadrons might have smaller hadronic cross sections  @xcite and therefore decouple from the fireball early , perhaps right at the point of hadronization .",
    "this would explain the low and higher temperature parameter .",
    "most importantly , the finite value of therefore must be cumulated prior to hadronization - via partonic interactions .",
    "elliptic flow , due to its self - quenching nature , is an early stage signal  @xcite . in non - central nuclear collisions ,",
    "the initial overlap zone between the colliding nuclei is spatially deformed .",
    "if the matter produced in the reaction zone re  scatters efficiently , this spatial anisotropy is transferred into momentum space and the initial , locally isotropic , momentum distribution develops anisotropies .",
    "this anisotropy in momentum space is quantified by the second fourier coefficient @xmath14 , the elliptic flow parameter .",
    "results on elliptic flow measurements at rhic are shown in fig .  2 , ( a )  for @xmath15 and , ( b )  double - strange  @xcite and ( c )  triple - strange  @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow parameter increases with  and then saturates at larger . in the lower  region , a mass ordering is observed with lighter particles exhibiting larger elliptic flow parameters .",
    "the shaded bands show results from hydrodynamical calculations for @xmath16  ( upper edge ) to @xmath10  ( lower edge ) , assuming zero mean free path length and therefore infinitely fast re  scattering which leads to instantaneous local thermal equilibrium distributions .",
    "these calculations qualitatively describe the experimental results in the lower  region , especially the observed mass ordering . as can be seen in fig .  2 ,",
    "even the multi - strange baryons  ( b ) and  ( c ) do significantly flow .",
    "this suggests that collective flow of multi - strange baryons  and  indeed develops before hadronization - among partons .     and",
    "@xcite , ( b )  double - strange  @xcite and ( c )  triple - strange  @xcite .",
    "values for @xmath14 versus  both scaled by the number @xmath17 of constituent quarks are shown in panel ( d ) .",
    "the shaded bands show results from hydrodynamical calculations for @xmath16  ( upper edge ) to @xmath10  ( lower edge ) .",
    "the dash - dotted lines are results from empirical fit - functions  @xcite for baryons ( upper ) and mesons ( lower ) . ]    in the intermediate  region ( 2 - 6 ) , the calculations overshoot the data . at these momenta ,",
    "the mean free path length is relatively large leading to deviations from hydrodynamic behavior . in this region ,",
    "the saturation level depends on particle type : baryons saturate at larger values than mesons .",
    "the dash - dotted lines are results from empirical fit - functions  @xcite .",
    "this particle type dependence is accounted for in quark coalescence models  @xcite . in these hadronization models ,",
    "hadrons are dominantly formed by coalescing massive constituent quarks from a partonic system with the intrinsic assumption of collective flow among these partons .",
    "these models predict a universal scaling of the observed elliptic flow @xmath14 and the hadron transverse momentum  with the number of constituent quarks @xmath17 ( meson , @xmath18 , baryon , @xmath19 ) .",
    "the accordingly @xmath17-scaled values for @xmath14 versus  are shown in fig .",
    "2(d ) . above a parton momentum",
    "@xmath20  , the predicted universal scaling holds within experimental uncertainties . an exception might be @xmath16 which can be attributed to the contribution of feeddown from resonances with @xmath16 in the decay channel  @xcite .",
    "the successful prediction of quark coalescence models further supports the idea that collectivity develops at the partonic stage at rhic . the important question and maybe the final step to a qgp discovery at rhic is the status of thermalization of light quarks .",
    "heavy - flavor quarks are special probes because of their heavy mass .",
    "if chiral symmetry is restored in a qgp , light quarks obtain their small current masses . on the other hand ,",
    "heavy quarks get almost all their mass from their coupling to the higgs field  @xcite .",
    "thus , heavy quarks stay heavy - even in a qgp .",
    "the observation of heavy - quark collective flow indicates multiple interactions among partons .",
    "this would suggest that light quarks are thermalized .",
    "first results on heavy - flavor production at rhic have been reported from observing electrons stemming from the decay of heavy - flavor .",
    "recent results of elliptic flow measurements on electrons from heavy - flavor semileptonic decays  @xcite are shown in fig .  3 as a function of  from star  ( closed squares ) and phenix  ( open circles ) .",
    "the electron momentum range = 0.5 - 2.0  corresponds to heavy - flavor hadron = 1.0 - 4.0  . in this region , the values of @xmath14 are significantly different from zero .",
    "the curves show results from calculations within a quark coalescence model  @xcite assuming identical flow of heavy and light quarks ( solid ) and no heavy quark flow ( dotted ) and microscopic calculations using different partonic cross sections  @xcite of 10  mb  ( dashed ) and 3  mb  ( dash - dotted ) .",
    "both models support the idea of heavy - flavor collectivity at rhic , while the unexpectedly large cross section needed to describe the experimental data comes as a surprise .",
    "it is possible , as argued by several theorists , that elliptic flow and energy loss of heavy quarks are correlated  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore very interesting to study both elliptic flow and nuclear modification factors .",
    "however , due to the decay kinematics , important information on heavy - flavor dynamics is smeared .",
    "it seems that we do not fully understand the underlying mechanism of heavy - flavor interaction with the dense medium . at higher , therefore , it is also important to measure distributions from directly reconstructed @xmath21-mesons in order to isolate the bottom contributions in collisions at rhic .",
    "-mesons from direct reconstruction through the invariant mass of decay - daughter candidates in  collisions at = 200  gev as a function of  @xcite .",
    "the dashed line shows the fit - result of a pqcd inspired power - law function .",
    "a prediction from hydro - dynamically inspired model calculations is shown by the solid line .",
    "( b ) the modification of the @xmath22 spectrum as a function of transverse momentum for three different flow velocities . ]    the measured invariant yield of @xmath21-mesons from direct reconstruction through the invariant mass of decay - daughter candidates in  collisions at = 200  gev is shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) as a function of  @xcite .",
    "the spectrum steeply falls with increasing momentum , followed by a long tail at high .",
    "the dashed line shows the fit - result of a pqcd inspired power - law function , describing the experimental data over the whole momentum range .",
    "a prediction from hydro - dynamically inspired model calculations is shown by the solid line . in these calculations ,",
    "a kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath4 = 160 mev and an average flow velocity = 0.4 ( in units of speed of light ) was assumed .",
    "both curves are normalized to the same yield in the momentum range = 0 - 14  .",
    "the presence of collective flow modifies the spectrum , its shape changes from concave ( no - flow in  collisions ) to convex ( flow in  collisions ) .",
    "the modification of the 0  spectrum is further quantified by taking the ratio @xmath23 of the spectra expected from  collisions ( flow ) relative to  collisions ( non - flow ) .",
    "figure  4(b ) shows the modification of the @xmath22 spectrum as a function of average transverse momentum for three different flow velocities with = 0.1  ( dotted ) , 0.2  ( dashed ) and 0.4  ( solid ) . the modification is in the order of 30 - 50% with the maximum moving to larger momentum with increasing flow velocity .    due to the large multiplicities of @xmath16,k , p and the rather small production cross section for charm - hadrons ,",
    "the combinatorial background in the invariant mass distribution is roughly 1000 times larger than the signal  @xcite .",
    "extending particle identification by time of flight information will improve the statistical significance by a factor of five .",
    "this large combinatorial background leads to systematic uncertainties of extracted charm - hadron yields in the order of 30% . on the other hand , elliptic flow modulates particle yields with respect to the reaction plane in the order of 10% . to overcome these large systematic uncertainties and make precise heavy - flavor elliptic flow measurements feasible",
    ", we propose to upgrade star with @xmath1-vertex capabilities to identify heavy - flavor hadrons through their displaced decay vertex  @xcite .",
    "elliptic flow measurements have demonstrated that partonic collectivity , collective flow of partons , develops in 200  gev au+au collisions at rhic . to pin down the partonic eos of matter produced at rhic , the status of thermalization in such collisions has to be addressed .",
    "since the masses of heavy - flavor quarks , e.g. charm quarks , are much larger than the maximum possible excitation of the system created in the collision , heavy - flavor collective motion could be used to indicate the thermalization of light flavors ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the completion of the time of flight barrel and the proposed upgrade with a @xmath1vertex detector for heavy - flavor identification in star are well suited for achieving these goals ."
