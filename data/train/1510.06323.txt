    "secondly , brotbek proved that the image of each left end , going through the full injections sequence , is exactly the kernel of a certain linear system at the right end .",
    "thirdly , by focusing on pure fermat - type hypersurface equations ( @xcite ) : @xmath60 with integers @xmath3 , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 are some homogeneous polynomials of the same degree @xmath63 , brotbek step - by - step traced back some kernel elements from each right end all the way to the left end , every middle step being an application of cramer s rule , and hence he constructed global twisted symmetric differential forms with neat determinantal structures ( @xcite ) .    thereafter , by employing the standard method of counting base - locus - dimension in two ways in algebraic geometry ( see e.g. lemma  [ full - rank - c*(n+1 ) ] below ) , brotbek established that the debarre ampleness conjecture holds when : @xmath64 for equal degrees : @xmath65 the constructions being flexible enough to embrace ` approximately equal degrees ' , in the same sense as theorem  [ main nefness theorem 1/2 ] below .    inspired much by brotbek s works , we propose the following answer to the debarre ampleness conjecture .",
    "the cotangent bundle of the intersection in @xmath66 of at least @xmath67 generic hypersurfaces with degrees @xmath68 is ample .",
    "in fact , we will prove the following main theorem , which coincides with the above theorem for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and whose effective bound @xmath71 will be obtained in theorem  [ main nefness theorem with d_0= ? ] .",
    "[ * ampleness ] [ main theorem ] over any field @xmath59 which is not finite , for all positive integers @xmath72 , for any nonnegative integers @xmath73 with : @xmath74 there exists a lower bound @xmath75 such that , for all positive integers : @xmath76 for generic @xmath77 hypersurfaces : @xmath78 with degrees : @xmath20 the cotangent bundle @xmath79 of the intersection of the first @xmath18 hypersurfaces : @xmath80 restricted to the intersection of all the @xmath77 hypersurfaces : @xmath81 is ample . *    first of all , remembering that _ ampleness ( or not ) is preserved under any base change obtained by ambient field extension _ , one only needs to prove the ampleness theorem  [ main theorem ] for algebraically closed fields @xmath59 .",
    "of course , we would like to have @xmath82 as small as possible , yet the optimal one is at present far beyond our reach , and we can only get exponential ones like : @xmath83 which confirms the large degree phenomena in kobayashi hyperbolicity related problems ( @xcite ) . when @xmath84 , we obtain linear bounds for equal degrees : @xmath85 hence we recover the lower bounds   in the case @xmath69 , and we also obtain quadratic bounds for all large degrees : @xmath86 better estimates of the lower bound @xmath87 will be explained in section  [ the construction of hypersurfaces revisit and better lower bounds ] .",
    "concerning the proof , primarily , as anticipated / emphasized by brotbek and merker ( @xcite ) , it is essentially based on constructing sufficiently many global negatively twisted symmetric differential forms , and then inevitably , one has to struggle with the overwhelming difficulty of clearing out their base loci , which seems , at the best of our knowledge , to be an incredible mission .    in order to bypass the complexity in these two aspects ,",
    "the following seven ingredients are indispensable in our approach :    * generalized brotbek s symmetric differential forms ( subsection  [ general - holomorphic - symmetric - forms ] ) ; * global _ moving coefficients method _ ( mcm ) ( subsection  [ the - global - moving - coefficients - method ] ) ; * ` hidden ' symmetric forms on intersections with coordinate hyperplanes ( subsection  [ regular twisted symmetric differential forms with some vanishing coordinates ] ) ; * mcm on intersections with coordinate hyperplanes ( subsection  [ the - moving - coefficients - method - for - intersections - with - coordinate - hyperplanes ] ) ; * algorithm of mcm ( subsection  [ subsection : constructing - algorithm ] ) ; * core lemma of mcm ( section  [ section : the engine of mcm ] ) ; * product coup ( subsection  [ subsection : product coup ] ) .",
    "in fact , is based on a geometric interpretation of brotbek s symmetric differential forms ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.5 ) ) , and has the advantage of producing symmetric differential forms by directly copying hypersurface equations and their differentials . facilitated by , which is of certain combinatorial interest , amazingly cooks a series of global negatively twisted symmetric differential forms , which are of nice uniform structures .",
    "however , unfortunately , one still has the difficulty that all these obtained global symmetric forms happen to coincide with each other on the intersections with any two coordinate hyperplanes , so that their base locus stably keeps positive ( large ) dimension , which is an annoying obstacle to ampleness .",
    "then , to overcome this difficulty enters , which is arguably the most critical ingredient in harmony with mcm , and whose importance is much greater than its appearance as somehow a corollary of .",
    "thus , to compensate the defect of - , it is natural to design which completes the framework of mcm .",
    "and then , is smooth to be devised , and it provides suitable hypersurface equations for mcm .",
    "now , the last obstacle to amplness is about narrowing the base loci , an ultimate difficulty solved by .",
    "thus , the debarre conjecture is settled in the central cases of almost equal degrees .",

    "when @xmath59 has positive characteristic , by the same arguments , we could also receive the same very - ampleness theorem provided the similar results about the fujita conjecture hold over the field @xmath59 .",
