    "distant extrasolar gaseous giant planets in nearly circular orbits have been detected by direct imaging observations in several systems ( e.g.,@xcite ) . in the conventional core accretion model ,",
    "it is difficult to form cores that are massive enough to undergo runaway gas accretion at @xmath4au within disk lifetime ( @xmath5 a few million years ) , because the core growth timescale is roughly proportional to a cube of the distance from the central star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the cores can not be formed in such distant regions , gas giant planets formed interior to 30au can be scattered by other giant planets to attain semimajor axes @xmath6au ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because the dynamical energy is lower in outer regions , @xmath3 of scattered planets",
    "are broadly distributed up to @xmath7au . however , due to the conservation of the total angular momentum , the eccentricities @xmath8 of the scattered orbits must be excited to be close to unity . while disk - planet interactions tend to damp such high values of @xmath8 , they may not be efficient enough to account for the observed low eccentricities of distant , gas giant planets , because local protoplanetary disk mass may not be massive enough in the distant regions @xcite .",
    "this difficulty has raised the possibility of formation of gas giants by disk gravitational instability ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "@xcite showed that if disk instability forms planetary mass clumps , it would form more abundant brown - dwarfs and m - star companions .",
    "a population synthesis simulation based on the disk instability model ( @xcite ) showed that most of such brown - dwarfs and m - star companions may be retained in outer regions .",
    "however , it is not consistent with direct imaging surveys so far done .",
    "furthermore , the observationally clear correlation between fraction of stars with gas giants and stellar metallicity ( @xcite ) is not easy for the disk instability model to explain , while the correlation is consistent with the core accretion model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "based on the core accretion model , @xcite proposed outward type ii migration for the origin of the distant gas giants in nearly circular orbits .",
    "however , the outward type ii migration requires a pair of giant planets in a common gap with the inner one more massive than the outer one and appropriate disk conditions .",
    "@xcite found out another path to form the distant gas giants in nearly circular orbits , based on the core accretion model : outward scattering of cores by a nearby gas giant followed by accretion of gas in outer regions . because the orbital circularization through gas accretion was also shown by a hybrid n - body and 2d hydrodynamical simulation ( e. thommes 2010 , private communication ) ,",
    "this path is one of promising mechanisms .",
    "details of the path they found are as follows .",
    "oligarchic growth produces similar - sized multiple cores ( @xcite ) .",
    "once some core starts runaway gas accretion , the planet s mass rapidly increases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when the mass increase is fast enough , the planet undergoes close encounters with nearby cores to strongly scatter them rather than shepherd them ( @xcite ) .",
    "some cores are scattered to large distance where the surface densities of both residual planetesimals and gas are relatively low .",
    "if the scattered planet is a gas giant , its mass could be comparable to or larger than the local disk mass , because the scattering may occur in a late disk evolution stage after the formation of the gas giant .",
    "then , eccentricity damping due to dynamical friction from local disk gas is inefficient .    on the other hand , in the core scattering model ,",
    "cores masses are usually well below the local disk mass . however , since the scattered cores have highly eccentric orbits and the relative velocity between the cores and the disk gas should be highly supersonic , dynamical friction from the local disk gas is less efficient ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the dynamical friction timescale in supersonic regime for a planet with mass @xmath9 , orbital eccentricity @xmath8 and semimajor axis @xmath3 in a gas disk with surface density @xmath10 is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the host star s mass , @xmath13 is local sound velocity , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are kepler velocity and its orbital period at @xmath3 . for a planet with mass @xmath16 in a highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath17 ) with @xmath18au , @xmath19 is as long as @xmath20 years , which is longer than an observationally inferred disk lifetime @xmath21 years .",
    "thereby , the dynamical friction from local disk gas may be less effective than the orbital circularization via planetary gas accretion , which we discuss in this paper ( see section [ sec : pop ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since the dynamical friction also damps semimajor axis efficiently in the course of eccentricity damping from values close to unity , we may not be able to retain the cores in outer regions .",
    "reduction in the planetesimal accretion rate decreases the critical core mass for the onset of gas accretion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the scattered cores in highly eccentric orbits spend most of time at large distances , where planetesimal accretion rate is significantly low , so that it is possible for the scattering to trigger gas accretion onto the cores . in the case of highly eccentric orbits , since the cores spend most of time near apocenters at large distance , their orbits are circularized there through accretion of local gas with higher specific angular momentum . as a result , it is expected that the cores orbits are circularized keeping their apocenters almost fixed , in the course of gas accretion .",
    "we will show that the apocenter shrinks because the semimajor axis slightly shrinks due to energy dissipation by collision between the disk gas and the planet and that the energy dissipation accelerates the orbital circularization ( in the case of moderate eccentricity , the energy dissipation is more important for the orbital circularization than accretion of high angular momentum gas ) .    assuming that the orbits of the scattered cores are quickly circularized to the degree that depends on the ratio between the planet mass and local disk mass with their semimajor axes kept fixed ,",
    "@xcite performed a population synthesis simulation to predict statistical distributions of distant gas giants formed by this mechanism .",
    "they showed that the fraction of systems with the distant gas giants is a @xmath221% and most of them have low eccentricities ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "although the fraction is further lower , systems with multiple distant gas giants are also formed , because a single gas giant can scatter multiple cores in inner regions .",
    "hr8799 system has four distant gas giants and the outer three planets could be in 4:2:1 resonance . in the scattering core model ,",
    "formation of four distant gas giants is extremely rare and probability for capture into the resonances during inward migration associated with eccentricity damping is not clear .",
    "however , the inner two planets have semimajor axes @xmath5 15 and 27 au , which could be formed _ in situ _ without the scattering process .",
    "formation of hr8799 system by core accretion scenario is a very interesting problem that should be addressed in the future . in this paper , we focus on a fundamental process of orbital circularization of an isolated planet through gas accretion .    in the core scattering model ,",
    "positive correlation between the semimajor axis and the mass of the distant gas giants is predicted .",
    "the critical planet mass for gap opening is higher in larger orbital radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the gap opening halts growth of gas giants , the correlation is established , as shown in the population synthesis calculation in @xcite .    note that @xcite assumed that the eccentricities of the scattered cores are efficiently damped without any decrease in semimajor axes , implicitly assuming very efficient damping due to gas accretion , although they did not incorporate detailed orbital evolution by the gas accretion . as we will show , the eccentricity damping due to gas accretion is indeed efficient , while the degree of damping depends on how much the planets grow by accreting gas and semimajor axes are also damped by a factor of @xmath24 .",
    "the population synthesis simulation must be improved by incorporating the damping formulas due to gas accretion derived in this paper , in order to discuss the distribution of distant gas giants in comparison with observation when the number of discovered planets becomes large enough for statistical arguments .    here , we investigate the orbital circularization of the scattered planets during gas accretion through detailed analytical calculations .",
    "section 2 describes the assumptions of gas accretion onto the cores . in section 3 ,",
    "we analytically derive the formulas for the orbital evolution in the course of gas accretion . in section 4",
    ", we describe the orbital evolution by numerically solving the formulas . in section 5 , we show some results of the population synthesis calculations , by incorporating the prescriptions of orbital evolution through the mass growth due to accretion of disk gas .",
    "section 6 is devoted for summary .",
    "we start our calculation from the stage at which a core has already been scattered outward by a gas giant to attain eccentricity close to unity ( @xmath25 ) and semimajor axis ( @xmath26 ) that is much larger than the original one ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "note that the pericenter distance of the scattered planet s orbit must be close to @xmath27 : @xmath28 . since @xmath27 should be close to the gas giant s orbital radius",
    ", we can regards that @xmath2910au , based on core accretion model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as we will show later , the pericenter distance of the scattered planet quickly increases .",
    "accordingly , the planet immediately becomes isolated from the perturbing gas giant , so that we neglect its further perturbations .",
    "we do not calculate the initial scattering process by the gas giant , but study evolution of @xmath8 and @xmath3 of the scattered planet due to accretion of gas , for given @xmath25 , @xmath26 and disk radius @xmath30 , to derive general formulas for the orbital evolution . in the following ,",
    "we explain our prescriptions for accretion of gas onto the scattered planet .",
    "after a core mass exceeds a critical core mass , pressure gradient no longer supports gas envelope of the planet against the planetary gravitational force and quasi - static contraction of the gas envelope starts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the critical core mass is given by ( @xcite ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is opacity of the gas envelope and @xmath33 is that of the minimum - mass solar nebula model ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the planetesimal accretion rate , @xmath34 , determines heat energy source to support the envelope , a lower value of @xmath34 leads to a smaller value of @xmath35 .",
    "in general , planetesimal accretion rate rapidly decreases with orbital radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "after a core is scattered outward to acquire high orbital eccentricity , the core spends most of time at much larger orbital radii than near the original location .",
    "thereby , an orbit - averaged value of @xmath34 is significantly lowered and it is likely that quasi - static contraction of gas envelope is initiated by the outward scattering .    according to the quasi - static contraction , disk gas can be supplied to hill radius or bondi radius of the planet .",
    "this means that gas accretion rate onto the planet is regulated by heat transfer through the envelope rather than environmental disk gas conditions except in the final stage in which the contraction is very fast .",
    "the ( kelvin - helmholtz ) timescale of the envelope contraction is given by ( @xcite ) @xmath36 from these arguments , we assume that gas accretion rate does not depend on the position of the eccentric orbit during an orbital period , although environmental disk conditions considerably change during one orbital cycle for highly eccentric orbits .    in general , the dependence of @xmath37 on orbital radius @xmath38 is weak for radiation - dominated envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if convective envelope develops , envelope contraction rate can be affected by disk temperature and density @xcite . however , even if @xmath37 has the @xmath38-dependence , the dependence may be smoothed out when @xmath37 is longer than the orbital period , that is , when @xmath39 , because the response time of the envelope structure is given by @xmath37 . as we show in the following",
    ", gas accretion rate onto the planet may be regulated by disk gas supply rather than by envelope contraction for @xmath40 .",
    "note that in the highly eccentric orbit , bondi and hill radii significantly change during one orbital circulation .",
    "the change might also induce oscillation of gas envelope that could affect gas accretion and heat generation / cooling .",
    "investigation of this effect is left for a future work .",
    "we will only assume the constant accretion rate during one orbit inside the disk , but not adopt any particular form of @xmath37 .",
    "when the envelope contraction is faster than the supply of gas and the supply has the @xmath38-dependence , the assumption of the constant accretion rate is violated .",
    "the supply can be limited by global disk accretion and bondi accretion .",
    "the limit by global disk accretion becomes important for @xmath40 , because the quasi - static contraction rate is given by @xmath41 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : khtime ] ) ) and the observationally inferred typical value of disk accretion rates onto t tauri stars is @xmath42 .",
    "however , the @xmath38-dependence of disk accretion rate is very weak in the regions of @xmath43 , where a steady - accretion - disk approximation is valid .",
    "the bondi accretion rate is given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is disk gas density and @xmath46 is the relative velocity between the planet and disk gas .",
    "both @xmath45 and @xmath46 sensitively depend on @xmath38 . in general , @xmath47 for high @xmath8 and large @xmath48 .",
    "but , our calculations start from small @xmath48 and @xmath8 is already damped when @xmath48 becomes large .",
    "we found that in most of orbital evolution we consider , @xmath49 and the supply limit by bondi accretion does not occur .",
    "thus , our assumption of constant gas accretion may be justified . as a result of the time - independent gas accretion rate , the planet accretes gas preferentially in outer regions where the planet spends most of time .",
    "the specific angular momentum of the planetary orbit is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the pericenter distance and @xmath52 is assumed .",
    "that of the local gas near the apocenter ( @xmath53 ) is given by @xmath54 ( we assume circular keplerian motion for the disk gas ) . since @xmath55 for @xmath52 , the planet s specific angular momentum",
    "is increased by the accretion of local gas .",
    "then , the planetary orbit tends to be circularized with the apocenter distance ( @xmath56 ) fixed .",
    "if the orbit deviates from the disk with a finite size @xmath57 , beyond which gas density is significantly declined , we halt gas accretion at @xmath58 . in the following derivations ,",
    "we consider two cases : i ) the apocenter is inside the disk ( @xmath59 ) and ii ) it is outside the disk ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we will refer to cases i ) and ii ) as `` embedded case '' and `` deviated case , '' respectively . in the `` deviated case , '' the planet mostly accretes gas at @xmath61 and planetary orbits",
    "tend to be fitted to circular orbits at @xmath57 rather than those at @xmath56 .",
    "the specific orbital energies of the planet and local gas near the apocenter are @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . near the apocenter , the planet s",
    "specific orbital energy is increased by the accretion of local gas near the apocenter . however , the accretion of lower specific energy near the pericenter is significant due to a deep potential near the pericenter , in spite of fast passage of the pericenter . as we show in section [ sec : embedded ] , in the embedded case , the orbit - averaged specific orbital energy of accreting gas is exactly the same as that of the planet , irrespective of orbital eccentricity .",
    "the planet s specific orbital energy actually decreases if collisional dissipation between the planet and disk gas is taken into account .",
    "it also contributes to eccentricity damping , with slight decay of the semimajor axis .    in embedded case ,",
    "gas accretion rate onto the planet is independent of phase of the orbits . in the deviated case",
    ", we assume a constant gas accretion rate at @xmath64 and zero accretion rate at @xmath58 . we do not assume even the value of the constant accretion rate , because we will derive orbital evolution as a function of planetary mass @xmath48 but not as a function of time .",
    "the relative velocity between the planet and the disk gas would be supersonic almost everywhere for highly eccentric orbits with @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the disk scale height . for incident",
    "supersonic gas flow to stay in hill radius or bondi radius , we need some energy dissipation .",
    "bow shock in front of the planet may provide the energy dissipation",
    ". we will leave full hydrodynamic simulations on the bow shock for future work and assume that the planet accretes disk gas in unperturbed flow and the accretion rate is independent of orbital phase in most of calculations .",
    "note , however , that the relative velocity between the gas flow and the planet is smaller in the post - shock flow than in the unperturbed flow , which may make the eccentricity damping less efficient . in section 4.3 ,",
    "we perform calculations taking into account the effect of the shock with a simple 1d model and show that the eccentricity damping is indeed slowed down but does not significantly change our conclusion .    when cores are scattered by a gas giant , in early stage , eccentricities are preferentially pumped up compared with inclinations .",
    "but , if the core undergoes repeated close encounters before its orbit is circularized , orbital inclinations are also excited .",
    "we also calculated @xmath8 and @xmath3 evolution with non - zero inclinations .",
    "we have found that the final values of @xmath8 and @xmath3 change by less than 5% if the inclination is smaller than 30 degrees .",
    "so , we here show the results with zero inclinations .    in summary ,",
    "the assumptions we use in most of runs are :    1 .",
    "the gas disk is in keplerian rotation .",
    "because the relative velocity between the gas and the planet is generally supersonic , the gas is hardly perturbed by the planetary gravitational perturbations .",
    "2 .   the motions of the planet and the gas disk are coplanar .",
    "the gas accretion rate onto the planet is constant of during one orbit , so that orbit - averaging can be done .",
    "the planet captures the local unperturbed disk gas , conserving mass and angular momentum ( energy is not conserved ) .",
    "if the gas disk has the finite size , we truncate gas accretion during the period in which the planet goes out of the disk .    in section 3 through section 4.2 , we adopt the above assumptions and derive analytical formulas to describe the orbital circularization process through the gas accretion . even if we adopt assumption 4 . , analytical formulas are derived , since the constant gas accretion rate is still applied at @xmath67 and analytical orbit averaging",
    "can be done .",
    "if we include the effect of shock dissipation , analytical integration is not possible , so that we show the orbital evolution obtained by numerical integration ( section 4.3 ) .",
    "with the assumptions 1 to 4 described in the above , we analytically derive formulas to calculate the orbital evolution in the form of differential equations . numerically integrating the differential equations",
    ", we will show the evolution paths of @xmath8 and @xmath3 that are uniquely determined by their initial values and @xmath30 .    according to discussions in section 2 ,",
    "we first calculate changes in the angular momentum and energy of the planet , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , during one orbital period , assuming that the mass accretion rate is constant with time during one orbital period .",
    "we also assume that the changes in orbital elements are small enough over one orbital period , in other words , the mass of the captured gas during one orbit ( @xmath70 ) is much smaller than the instantaneous planetary mass ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "the changes @xmath68 and @xmath69 are then given by @xmath72 where the integral is during one orbit , @xmath73 is a duration at @xmath64 ( @xmath74 ) , @xmath75 is a pericenter passage , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are specific angular momentum and orbital energy of accreting gas and @xmath78 is energy dissipation by collision between the planet and accreting gas .    through @xmath68 and @xmath69 during mass growth of @xmath70 , specific angular momentum and orbital energy of the planet , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , are changed . since @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the change rate of @xmath79 and @xmath80 of the planet in one orbital period are expressed as @xmath83 where @xmath84 since @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath12 is the host star s mass , @xmath87 is the gravitational constant , the changes @xmath88 and @xmath89 are related with the changes of the eccentricity and semimajor axis ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) as @xmath92 so , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are given by @xmath93 where @xmath94    we finally derive the differential equations for the orbit - averaged evolution of @xmath8 and @xmath3 in terms of planetary mass @xmath71 : @xmath95 from these equations , we also obtain @xmath96    so far , we have not assumed any specific forms for @xmath97 and @xmath77 .",

    "the planet spends most of time in the outer regions where disk gas has higher specific orbital angular momentum than the planet . since the gas accretion rate from the disk is regulated by envelope contraction except for final gas accretion phase , we assume that disk gas accretion rate is constant within one orbit . even in the final phase when the accretion rate is limited by the supply of gas due to global disk accretion ,",
    "the assumption is valid if steady disk accretion is established .",

    "these show that planetary growth and orbital circularization concurrently proceed and the orbital circularization is very efficient .",
    "if we take into account the effect of bow shock for supersonic incident gas flow , the orbital circularization becomes slower , but it is still efficient enough to account for the observed orbital properties of distant gas giants . the orbit is left in large orbital radii , which are about half of the semimajor axes that the scattered icy cores initially acquire .",
    "we performed the population synthesis calculation by incorporating the fitting formulas for the eccentricity and semimajor axis damping by planet mass growth to indeed show that the damping is efficient and giants with @xmath252 are left in distant regions at @xmath0300au .",

    "we also consider the effect of the finite disk size . if the eccentric orbits of the scattered cores are deviated from the protoplanetary disk near their apocenters , their semimajor axes shrink to a quarter of the disk sizes . in other words ,",
    "if observations show a concentration of distant gas giants at some orbital radius , it could reflect typical sizes of the protoplanetary disks , in a similar way that the pile - up location of hot jupiters could reflect the size of magnetospheric cavity ( the size of the disk inner edge ) where type ii migration could be stalled .",
