    "numerical simulations of core - collapse supernovae have been showing significant rapid development during the last decade ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews and references therein ) . especially , multi - dimensional neutrino - radiation hydrodynamic simulation , which consistently solve the equations of hydrodynamics and neutrino transport , become a doable problem thanks to the advance in supercomputer performance and the development of efficient numerical schemes .",
    "after @xcite , an increasing number of authors have presented multi - dimensional simulations including some treatment of spectral neutrino transport , which obtained explosions ( @xcite for 2d and @xcite for 3d ) , while other simulations produced failures , i.e. , no explosion by neutrino heating @xcite .",
    "moreover , most of the successful studies suffer from the _ explosion energy problem _ , that is , the explosion energies obtained in these simulations ( @xmath4 erg ) are much smaller than the canonical observed values ( @xmath5 erg ) .",
    "a supernova simulation is an initial value problem . in particular ,",
    "the initial conditions of such a simulation are based on stellar evolutionary calculations . in these one - dimensional calculations",
    "many assumptions and approximations are employed , especially to treat multi - dimensional flows , such as e.g. convection , because currently only one - dimensional ( spherically symmetric ) calculations are feasible .",
    "however , multi - dimensional effects are supposed to make explosions easier , as e.g. the non - radial velocity field inside burning shells @xcite .",
    "several authors have investigated the influence of the progenitor properties systematically @xcite using different progenitor models ( especially from * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these studies have revealed that the explosion characteristics strongly depend on the mass of the progenitor and on its internal structure .",
    "however , it is still unclear which are the most important quantities among those characterizing the internal structure of a core - collapse supernova progenitor .    because stellar evolutionary calculations are subject to restrictions ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent code comparison ) , we decided to generate progenitor models by ourselves in a more systematic and manageable way . to this end , we used the approach proposed by @xcite to construct initial models . in this approach",
    "one prescribes the distributions of entropy and electron fraction ( @xmath6 ) in a progenitor model as functions of the mass coordinate , and one assumes hydrostatic equilibrium to obtain the density structure from these distributions",
    ". the hydrodynamic evolution of the progenitor models is then simulated employing a microscopic equation of state .",
    "we note that the temperature distribution is more crucial when one wants to obtain initial modes whose energy generation rates are consistent with those of stellar evolution models .",
    "however , since the entropy distribution is better suited for characterizing parametrized initial models , we use it instead of the temperature distribution in this work .    contrary to @xcite , we apply their approach to modern radiation hydrodynamic simulations of neutrino - driven core - collapse supernovae .",
    "while a neutrino - driven explosion is the current standard paradigm for core - collapse supernovae , @xcite were discussing the influence of progenitor properties on the prompt explosion scenario , in which the prompt shock resulting from core bounce was thought to cause the explosion . in particular , we have performed one - dimensional ( 1d ) general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations including a detailed treatment of neutrino transport and a nuclear equation of state , i.e. , our study is more elaborate than that of @xcite .    using this approach",
    ", we were able to perform a comprehensive parameter study which displays the dependencies of the outcome of 1d core - collapse supernova simulations on the properties of the progenitor models .",
    "in addition , our approach has the advantage over other numerical studies of core - collapse supernovae , which all rely on progenitor models from stellar evolutionary calculations ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that broader initial conditions can be studied than those currently predicted by stellar evolutionary calculations .    in section[sec",
    ": progenitor ] we explain how we constructed the progenitor models , and in section[sec : hydrodynamic ] we describe our hydrodynamic method and present the results of our simulations .",
    "we discuss in detail the influence of the progenitor properties on the core - collapse supernova dynamics in section[sec : bc90 ] , and conclude in section[sec : summary ] with a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "in this section , we explain the strategies to obtain progenitor models for core - collapse supernova simulations . first of all , we construct progenitor models resembling the stellar evolutionary model s11.2 of @xcite , which has been widely used in hydrodynamic simulations .      to construct a progenitor model for our hydrodynamic simulations , we solve the hydrostatic equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the pressure , the mass coordinate , the gravitational constant , and the radial coordinate , respectively .",
    "the density is given by @xmath10 .",
    "to solve eq.([eq : hydrostatic ] ) one needs to specify a value for the central density , @xmath11 , which is one of the parameters of this approach , and one needs to have @xmath12 given as a function of density @xmath13 , entropy @xmath14 , and electron fraction @xmath6 , i.e. , an equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "following @xcite , we change @xmath15 in eq.([eq : hydrostatic ] ) , where @xmath16 is a factor mimicking the fact that the progenitors are no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium , but already in a dynamic state .",
    "we used this procedure to destabilize the core in a uniform way , because reducing instead the pressure ( by reducing the entropy or @xmath6 ) may lead to undesirable effects , like e.g. , a strange mass accretion history ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we give the distributions of @xmath14 and @xmath6 as functions of the mass coordinate @xmath17 that we used in our study .",
    "given these functions , we integrate eq.([eq : hydrostatic ] ) and obtain @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "due to limited extent of the tabular equation of state used in our simulations , we integrate eq.([eq : hydrostatic ] ) outward in mass until the density drops below a value of @xmath20g@xmath21 .",
    "we note that this newtonian treatment of the progenitor model is compatible with the general relativistic treatment used in our hydrodynamic simulations , because the central lapse function is @xmath22 for the progenitor models , i.e. , the use of the newtonian approximation is well justified .",
    "( red line ) and electron fraction @xmath6 ( blue line ) distribution as a function of mass for our progenitor models .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    following @xcite the entropy as a function of mass @xmath17 of our progenitor models is given by @xmath23 and the electron fraction by @xmath24 ( see also fig.[fig : schematic ] ) .",
    "these two distributions contain the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , which uniquely characterize the progenitor model .",
    "the mass parameters have the following significance for an iron core which is undergoing silicon shell - burning after the central convective core has been exhausted of fuel .",
    "@xmath25 is the mass coordinate of the edge of the final convection in the radiative core , @xmath26 is the mass coordinate of the inner edge of the convection zone in the iron core , @xmath27 is the mass coordinate up to which the core matter is in nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse core ) , @xmath28 is the iron core mass , and @xmath29 is the mass coordinate at the base of the silicon / oxygen shell which has a much larger entropy than the iron core ( @xmath37 ) and consequently a much lower density .    since the entropy distribution is a consequence of a complicated sequence of burning and convection stages , its profile is more structured than the @xmath6 profile , because the latter only depends on the electron capture timescale .",
    "different from @xcite , we used two additional parameters , @xmath29 and @xmath33 , in our study , because in more recent stellar evolutionary models the locations do not coincide where @xmath14 and @xmath6 increase strongly . also note that in @xcite the iron core mass is given by @xmath38 , whereas it is @xmath28 in our study .",
    "according to stellar evolutionary calculations , these above parameters vary from progenitor model to progenitor model .",
    "for example , @xmath30 varies from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , and the values of @xmath29 range from @xmath41 to @xmath42 ( see table [ tab4 ] in the appendix ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath43 time until bounce since the beginning of the simulation + @xmath44 time past bounce when the shock reaches a radius of 400 km in the exploding models + @xmath45 final time of the simulation + @xmath46 maximum shock radius + @xmath47 final mass of the pns , which is defined by @xmath48g@xmath21 + @xmath49 diagnostic explosion energy when the shock reaches a radius of 1000 km + @xmath50 diagnostic explosion energy at @xmath51 , when it is still increasing + @xmath52 growth rate of the diagnostic explosion energy estimated 30ms before @xmath51 + @xmath53 value of @xmath6 in the center at @xmath54 + @xmath55 initial kinetic energy , which is estimated by the maximum value of the kinetic energy inside the mass of the largest infall velocity +    [ tab4 ]        in table[tab4 ] we provide an overview of the hydrodynamic simulations with our second set of models .",
    "the table columns give the time until bounce , the postbounce time when the shock reaches a radius of 400 km , the final time of the simulation , the maximum shock radius , the final baryonic mass of the pns , and the diagnostic explosion energy at the times when the shock reaches a radius of 1000 km and at @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the growth rate of the diagnostic energy at @xmath56 is given in the next column .",
    "the remaining columns give the value of @xmath6 in the center at @xmath54 , and the initial kinetic energy .",
    "the pns mass is defined as the mass with @xmath57 g @xmath21 , and the diagnostic explosion energy as the integral of the local energy , i.e. the sum of the specific internal , kinetic and gravitational energies , of all zones where this quantity and the radial velocity are positive .",
    "here we used the general relativistic expression for the local energy of @xcite , which is given as @xmath58 - \\rho w c^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the lapse function , @xmath60 the speed of light , @xmath61 the specific internal energy , and @xmath62 the lorentz factor .",
    "this expression reduces to the well - known newtonian expression ( @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 being the gravitational potential and the velocity , respectively ) when one omits higher - order terms like @xmath66 .",
    "-@xmath33 plane ) of the models exploding or failing .",
    "exploding models are marked by open circles and non - exploding oners are represented by crosses .",
    "the size of the circle is proportional to the growth rate of the diagnostic explosion energy ( see table [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "the numbers attached to the symbols give the number of non - exploding models with @xmath67 g @xmath21.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    for model bc18 , which produces the most energetic explosion of our second set of models , @xmath68 and @xmath69baryon@xmath1 .",
    "the diagnostic explosion energy of this model already reaches 0.39b (= @xmath70erg ) at the end of the simulation , and it is still increasing ( see fig.[fig : exp_ene ] ) at a rate of @xmath714.7bs@xmath1 , i.e. , it will reach a value of 1b about 320ms after core bounce .",
    "figure [ fig : sc - s5 ] presents a score sheet , which provides an overview ( in the @xmath30-@xmath33 plane ) of the models exploding or failing .",
    "the exploding models are marked by open circles , while the non - exploding models are represented by crosses .",
    "the size of the circles is proportional to the growth rate of the diagnostic explosion energy towards the end of the simulation ( see table [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "obviously , smaller values of @xmath30 lead to a larger diagnostic explosion energy , and larger values of @xmath33 give rise to a faster growth rate of the diagnostic explosion energy in case of the exploding models .",
    "concerning the explosion energy one should note that the envelope located above the si / o layer has a large binding energy of @xmath72 to @xmath73 , the actual value depending on the zams mass of the progenitor ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , the values given in table[tab4 ] are not the observable explosion energies .",
    "to determine the latter energies , one needs to perform long - term simulations including the stellar envelopes , which will be left for future work .    for our second set of models ,",
    "the electron fraction at bounce is larger than in the simulations with our first set of models based on the stellar evolutionary model s11.2 ( see previous section and fig.[fig : s11.2 ] ) , in which @xmath74 .",
    "because of their smaller initial central entropy , the latter models have a lower temperature , which implies a smaller electron capture rate during collapse .",
    "the resulting larger electron fractions explain the larger kinetic energies at the bounce ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are given by the kinetic energy of the inner core at the `` last good homology '' @xcite .",
    "of the models listed in the upper part of table[tab4 ] , model bc02 has the largest initial kinetic energy . among these models ,",
    "model bc02 is also the only exploding model .",
    "although a higher value of @xmath34 also leads to a larger value of @xmath75 and a larger initial kinetic energy ( see model bc19 in the lower part of table[tab4 ] ) , model bc19 does not explode because of its larger gravitational binding energy ( see table[tab3 ] ) .",
    "however , we note that in comparison to the other non - exploding models ( bc16-bc18 , bc20-bc22 ) , the shock propagates out to an exceptionally large maximum shock radius of 873 km in model bc19 , i.e , it is a marginal model marking the boundary between exploding and non - exploding models .    in all exploding models",
    "the explosion sets in early ( @xmath76 20ms after core bounce ) , which seems to suggest a prompt explosion .",
    "however , these explosions are still aided by neutrino heating , i.e. , they differ from prompt explosion models , in which initial kinetic energy is large enough to eject the envelope . to validate this statement",
    ", we performed a simulation without neutrino heating by setting the distribution function of streaming particles , which is essential for neutrino heating in idsa ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to zero .",
    "then , the exploding model does no longer explode , i.e. , it was no prompt explosion .    from these result , we conclude that the iron core structure is crucial for obtaining an explosion .",
    "especially , a low entropy at the center helps to make an explosion . to reach a more general conclusion ,",
    "we need a large number of simulations covering a wider range of parameter space , which will be reported in a forthcoming publication .",
    "in this paper , we investigated a method to construct parametrized initial progenitor models for core - collapse supernova simulations .",
    "so far , initial conditions of these simulations have been taken from the final phase of stellar evolutionary calculations , which depend on several uncertainties , like the treatments of semi - convection , overshooting , and composition mixing .",
    "in particular , many phenomenological treatments are employed to approximate multi - dimensional effects in evolution simulations done in spherical symmetry . in this paper",
    ", we proposed a alternative methodology to construct initial conditions .",
    "this is not a completely new idea and we reused a method by @xcite .",
    "however , different from these authors , we used the latest input microphysics including neutrino transfer , a microscopic nuclear equation of state and general relativistic hydrodynamics . in their paper , they presented functions of entropy and electron fraction expressed by mass coordinate . with these functions and solving hydrostatic equation , we can construct initial density structures .",
    "first of all , we constructed structures with parameters fitting the commonly used model s11.2 from @xcite and showed the similarity between our models and the model s11.2 .",
    "we then performed general relativistic neutrino - radiation hydrodynamics simulations in spherical symmetry with the public code agile - idsa @xcite and showed the reliability of our method .",
    "next , we constructed models based on parameters given in @xcite and studied parameter dependencies .",
    "interestingly , we found several exploding models with small central entropy even in spherically symmetric simulations .",
    "more surprisingly , models with a large entropy in the si / o layer give rather large explosion energies , @xmath3 erg at the final time of our simulations , and the energy still being increasing .    nevertheless of the large explosion energy ( @xmath77 erg ) , we find that the pns masses are rather small ( @xmath78 in baryonic mass ) for exploding models , so that these explosions are not fully compatible with observations .",
    "this discrepancies will be reduced when we use multi - dimensional simulations , since multi - dimensional effects amplify neutrino heating and explodability significantly .",
    "these simulations would produce an explosion for models that do not explode in spherically - symmetric simulations for a larger value of the central entropy , and would lead to continuous mass accretion onto a pns .",
    "with multi - d simulations , we may find parameter sets leading to a large explosion energy , @xmath5 erg , and a typical ns gravitational mass , @xmath76 1.32.0 @xmath79 , which is typically @xmath80% smaller than the baryonic mass .",
    "a broader parameter survey is necessary to explore these more promising combinations .    in this study we considered initial modesl with different entropy stratificationss , but did not pay much attention to the temperature profiles .",
    "however , the temperature distribution is crucially important for nuclear synthesis and the energy generation rate in burning layers .",
    "therefore , our current model might not be fully consistent with stellar evolution and an improvement will be presented in the forthcoming papers .",
    "this work is the very first step toward investigating initial conditions other than those resulting from stellar evolutionary calculations .",
    "the virtue of the method used in our study is that we can choose initial conditions beyond those predicted by current stellar evolutionary calculations .",
    "hence , we may be able to find robust conditions for energetic explosions , i.e. explosions in which the energy is larger than the canonical value @xmath81 erg .",
    "this is one of the important goals for the core - collapse supernova simulation community .",
