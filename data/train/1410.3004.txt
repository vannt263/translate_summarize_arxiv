    "the derivation of reduced models for various complex high - dimensional systems has been an active area of research for many decades , and it has recently received increased attention with particular emphasis on practical applications .",
    "for example , a stochastic mode reduction strategy was proposed in the context of atmospheric applications in @xcite .",
    "this strategy has been successfully applied to several prototype problems @xcite , and it also has been applied to more realistic geophysical examples @xcite .",
    "the technique builds on the idea of adiabatic elimination of fast variables in multiscale stochastic systems @xcite and assumes the existence of scale separation between the ( low - dimensional ) slow and ( high - dimensional ) fast variables . in the context of atmospheric applications , it is plausible to consider systems where the fast variables are driven stochastically and interact with the slow dynamics in an energy - conserving fashion . since then , this technique has been extended to purely deterministic conservative systems with a chaotic deterministic heat bath constituting the fast variables @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a mathematical formalism which extends the stochastic mode reduction to systems where the fast sub - system is deterministic and energy - conservative , but the slow variables can evolve in a stochastic or chaotic fashion . therefore , unlike in @xcite , the total energy of the system is not conserved and the interactions of the slow variables with the fast bath affect the total energy of the fast sub - system .",
    "the most striking examples of such models are coupled parabolic - hyperbolic systems where the hyperbolic part plays the role of the fast sub - system .",
    "such models arise , for example , in thermo - elasticity @xcite and thermo - visco - elasticity @xcite , where they can be viewed as simplified versions of the true fluid - structure interaction models : the hyperbolic and the parabolic parts describe the fast - moving waves and the temperature in the domain , respectively .",
    "applications of the stochastic mode reduction strategy typically require understanding the statistical behavior of the fast sub - system .",
    "often , a mixed analytical - computational approach can be employed to evaluate the statistical behavior of the fast conservative sub - system on a shell of constant energy . however , since the energy of the fast sub - system is changing in time through the interactions with the slow modes , it is necessary to explicitly introduce the energy of the fast sub - system as an additional hidden slow variable in order to extend the stochastic mode reduction strategy to models described in the previous paragraph .",
    "we demonstrate that a closed - form stochastic differential equation for the evolution of the slow dynamics ( including energy ) can be derived and the coefficients in this equation can be evaluated from a single numerical simulation of the fast - sub - system on an ( arbitrary ) shell of constant energy . here",
    "we illustrate our approach on a simple prototype model  more realistic examples will be considered in subsequent papers . in particular , we consider an extended triad model which elucidates analytical and numerical issues of the stochastic - mode reduction for systems with deterministic conservative heat bath .",
    "to illustrate our approach we consider a prototype extended triad model @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the slow variable , @xmath2 , @xmath3 are the fast variables , @xmath4 is the total number of fast variables , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 are interaction coefficients obeying the energy - conserving relationships @xmath8 @xmath9 the fast variables are determined by the @xmath10 timescale in the equation and the virtual fast sub - system becomes @xmath11 condition   is essential for the formalism presented below .",
    "it ensures that the virtual fast sub - system in is energy conservative which guarnatees the existence of an invariant measure for this sub - system .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of this invariant measure is a necessary condition for the applicability of the approach presented in this paper .",
    "condition , on the other hand , ensures that the energy is conserved by the interactions between the slow variable and the fast modes and , thus , guarantees the existence of the invariant measure for the full model in .",
    "we stress that we made this assumption for simplicity : the existence of an invariant mesaure for the full system   is not necessary for our approach , and the formalism presented here is also potentially applicable to systems where the interaction between the slow variables and the fast sub - system is not energy - conservative .    one can attempt to apply the stochastic mode reduction strategy to the model in directly . in the stochastic mode reduction procedure one needs to consider the behavior of the fast - subsystem and certain statistical properties of @xmath12-variables (",
    "e.g. correlations functions ) typically enter as coefficients into the reduced model .",
    "the behavior of the fast - subsystem depends drastically on the energy level , but the energy in the fast modes changes in time due to the interaction with the slow variables .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to consider the energy of the fast sub - system @xmath13 as an additional slow variable to explicitly keep track of the changes in the statistical behavior of @xmath12-variables .",
    "the extended multiscale triad model becomes @xmath14 where we used the property to simplify the equation for the energy .",
    "the stationary distribution of the generalized triad model can be computed explicitly for any @xmath15 and it is easy to show that the stationary distribution for @xmath16 is a product of gaussian distributions with mean zero and identical variances @xmath17 . in particular , the stationary distribution does not depend on the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the fokker - planck equation for the invariant density @xmath18 for @xmath16 in can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20    the differential operator @xmath21 annihilates the gaussian density @xmath22 operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 annihilate separately any function of the full energy @xmath25 with @xmath26 in due to the conservation of energy properties in and .",
    "therefore , they also annihilate the function @xmath27 \\right).\\ ] ]    thus , the invariant measure for @xmath28 in is a product measure with @xmath29 the stationary distribution for the energy @xmath26 in can be easily derived since the joint stationary distribution of fast variables is a product of gaussian densities and , therefore , the stationary distribution for @xmath26 is a @xmath30-squared distribution @xmath31 the joint stationary distribution for the slow variables @xmath1 and @xmath26 is a product density of the corresponding marginal densities in and .",
    "derivation of the reduced model for @xmath1 in @xmath26 in proceeds in a typical fashion .",
    "the kolmogorov backward equation associated with for a scalar function @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 where the operators above are @xmath35    next , we introduce the projection operator @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the invariant measure of the fast sub - system .",
    "the energy of the fast sub - system does not change in time and , thus , the measure @xmath37 is concentrated on the sphere of constant energy . in the absence of additional information , we assume that the measure @xmath37 is the uniform measure on the sphere , i.e. @xmath38 where @xmath4 is the total number of fast variables , @xmath26 is the fixed energy in the fast subsystem , @xmath39 is the normalizing factor such that @xmath40 does not depend on @xmath26 , and @xmath41 is the dirac delta function .",
    "considering the expansion @xmath42 and collecting powers of @xmath15 we obtain @xmath43 the first equation implies that @xmath44 and is independent of the fast variables @xmath45 since @xmath46 involves differentiation with respect to only @xmath12 variables .",
    "applying @xmath47 to the second equation in we obtain the compatibility condition @xmath48 ( since @xmath47 is the projection with respect to the invariant measure of the fast subsystem and , thus @xmath49 ) . the second equation in ( [ l operators ] )",
    "implies that @xmath50    finally , substituting into the third equation and applying @xmath47 to both sides we obtain the reduced ( homogenized ) equation for @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the reduced operator given by @xmath54 note , that the stochastic terms in the equation for @xmath1 which are not affected by the fast sub - system are simply `` carried through '' by the mode reduction procedure , i.e. the reduced backward equation involves the term @xmath55 , where operator @xmath56 corresponds to the terms without @xmath15 in the equation for @xmath1 .",
    "derivation of the reduced operator proceeds in a formal fashion by manipulating the summations in the expression and formally expressing the action of @xmath57 .",
    "details of the derivation are presented in appendix [ a1 ] .",
    "the compatibility condition @xmath48 implies the following conditions on the stationary first and second moments of the @xmath12-variables in the statistical behavior of the fast sub - system @xmath58 the first condition is quite plausible , it simply implies the symmetry of the distribution .",
    "the second condition is not obvious .",
    "while the the stationary second mixed moment @xmath59 is zero in the full model , the requirement in is for the dynamics of the deterministic fast sub - system .",
    "therefore , the conditions in need to be verified numerically in the simulations of the fast sub - system on a shell of constant energy .    the backward reduced operator can be computed explicitly and after substituting the action of @xmath57 and some formal manipulations it becomes @xmath60 where @xmath4 is the number of fast variables and @xmath61 is a numerical constant describing some bulk statistical properties of the fast sub - system . in particular",
    ", @xmath61 is the area under the fourth - order two - point moment of the fast sub - system computed on the energy level @xmath62 @xmath63 the numerical constant @xmath61 can not be deduced analytically and has to be computed numerically .",
    "nevertheless , this computation needs to be done only once using time - averaging in the simulations of the fast sub - system .",
    "moreover , the fast sub - system alone is not a multiscale system and , thus , can be simulated rather easily .",
    "the effective sde corresponding to the reduced operator is @xmath64",
    "to illustrate the mode reduction approach we choose parameters of the full model ( [ triad ] ) as @xmath65 the interaction coefficients are given in tables [ taba ] and [ tabb ] in appendix [ a2 ] .",
    "the corresponding number of triads in the full model is @xmath66    we use an analog of the split - step method to integrate the full model . in particular , due to the multiscale nature of the full model , the time - stepping for the deterministic part of the full model requires a relatively high order discretization formula in order to correctly represent the energy transfer between @xmath1 and @xmath12-variables during a single time - step .",
    "we observed empirically that the full model is rather sensitive to the deterministic integrator ; thus , we use a rk5 formula to integrate numerically the deterministic part of the system .",
    "next , we use euler discretization to add a gaussian random variable which approximates @xmath67 .",
    "the overall ( stochastic ) scheme is of order @xmath68 , but the energy transfer in this numerical scheme is represented much more accurately .",
    "this turns out to be essential .",
    "indeed we observed empirically that numerical simulations of the full system with the low - order deterministic discretization ( euler and rk2 ) produce severe discrepancies with analytical predictions ( e.g. the stationary distribution of the energy variable given by ) .",
    "both rk4 and rk5 discretizations of the deterministic terms produce similar results in this case , and we use a higher - order method to ensure the robustness of numerical results .",
    "we compute the statistical properties of the slow variable , @xmath1 , as well as the statistics of @xmath26 , since @xmath26 enters explicitly into the reduced model and stationary statistics of both variables should be used as a criteria for the comparison between the full model and the reduced dynamics .",
    "we use time - averaging combined with monte - carlo approach to accelerate computations of the full model in . in particular , we perform @xmath69 independent runs with different initial conditions of the full model with @xmath70 for time - averaging in each run and then average over these @xmath69 realizations .",
    "we use the time - step @xmath71 for @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the reduced model is integrated using the same method with the rk5 deterministic integrator and euler discretization for the noise . compared to the full model , the reduced system is not as sensitive to the choice of the discrete scheme for the deterministic terms . in particular , the numerical results with the rk2 and rk5 discretizations are very similar . however , a much smaller time - step is required for the numerical scheme with the euler discretization ( i.e. the stochastic euler - maruyama scheme ) to produce accurate results .",
    "we also perform a hybrid approach combining time - averaging and monte - carlo simulations to compute the stationary statistical properties of the reduced model .",
    "we run @xmath73 trajectories each with @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and different initial conditions , and then take the average of statistical quantities .",
    "the coefficient @xmath61 in the reduced model computed from the fast subsystem numerically is @xmath76    first , we examine the scale separation between the slow and the fast variables in the full model .",
    "comparison of correlation functions of the slow variables and a few fast modes for @xmath77 is presented in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the corresponding correlation times for @xmath77 are presented in table [ ct ] .",
    "correlation times are computed as the inverse of the area under the graph of the normalized correlation function .",
    ", @xmath78 and @xmath79 and @xmath80 ; modes @xmath81 and @xmath82 are among the slowest @xmath12-variables and their correlation functions illustrate the absence of scale separation for @xmath77.,width=453 ]    this simulation shows that there is a group of @xmath12-variables with time - scales comparable to the time - scale of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that there is no time - scale separation between the @xmath1 and @xmath12-variables for @xmath77 .",
    "however , we also observe that @xmath26 is much slower than @xmath1",
    ". moreover , table [ ct ] demostrates that the scale separation between the slow variables @xmath83 and fast @xmath12-variables increases as @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , although we expect that the stochastic mode reduction will perform quite well in the limit @xmath85 , the agreement with the numerical results for @xmath77 is not guaranteed .",
    "in addition , figure [ fig1 ] also demonstrates the necessity to include the energy @xmath26 in the reduced description .",
    "the energy @xmath86 acts as a hidden stochastic variable which is essential for the derivation of the reduced model ; figure [ fig1 ] indicates that it is not possible , for instance , to average the reduced model with respect to the stationary distribution for @xmath26 , since @xmath26 is much slower than @xmath1 ."
