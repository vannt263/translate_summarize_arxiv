    "the multitype contact process is a stochastic process that can be seen as a model for the evolution of different biological species competing for the occupation of space .",
    "it was introduced by neuhauser in @xcite as a modification of harris ( single - type ) contact process ( @xcite ) .",
    "let us give the definition of the multitype contact process @xmath3 on @xmath4 with ( at most ) two types .",

    "two kinds of transitions can occur .",
    "first , an individual of type @xmath21 dies with rate @xmath22 , leaving its site empty .",
    "second , given a pair of sites @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 or @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 , the occupant of @xmath29 gives birth at @xmath30 with rate @xmath31 , so that a new individual of type @xmath21 is placed at @xmath30 .",
    "note that , under these rules , births only occur at empty sites , so that the state of a site can never change directly from 1 to 2 or from 2 to 1 .    in case only one type ( say , type 1 )",
    "is present , this reduces to the contact process introduced by harris in @xcite , to be denoted here by @xmath32 in order to distinguish it from the multitype version .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for an exposition of the contact process and the statements about it that we will gather in this introduction and in section [ s : back ] .",
    "let @xmath33 be the ( one - type ) contact process with rates @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the initial configuration in which only the origin is occupied . denote by @xmath37 the configuration in which every vertex is empty , and note that this is a trap state for the dynamics .",

    ", as in . we will be particularly interested in the ` heaviside ' initial configuration , @xmath48 we will denote by @xmath49 the process with rates and initial configuration @xmath50 .",
    "we let @xmath51 the interval delimited by @xmath52 and @xmath53 is called the _ interface _ at time @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the _ position _ of the interface at time @xmath54 .",

    "we study the time dual of the multitype contact process .",
    "this dual , called the _ ancestor process _ , was first considered in @xcite and further studied in @xcite . in these references",
    ", it was shown that the ancestor process behaves approximately as a system of coalescing random walks on @xmath0 .",
    "because of this , our proofs of propositions [ prop : fdd ] and [ prop : tight ] are inspired in arguments that apply to coalescing random walks and the voter model , an interacting particle system whose dual is ( exactly ) equal to coalescing random walks . in particular , a key estimate for the proof of proposition [ prop : tight ] ( see lemma [ cla4onevstun ] ) was inspired in an argument by rongfeng sun for coalescing random walks ( @xcite ) .",
