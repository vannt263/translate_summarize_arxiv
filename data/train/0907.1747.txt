    "cosmological and astrophysical probes suggest that @xmath023% of the universe is composed of non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) , commonly assumed to be in the form of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) arising in extensions of the standard model of particle physics ( for reviews see , e.g.  @xcite ) . amongst",
    "the most widely discussed dm candidates are the lightest neutralino in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model  @xcite and the first excitation of the kaluza - klein bosons ( lkp ) in universal extra dimension theories.@xcite    the annihilation of wimp pairs can produce in the final state a continuum of gamma - rays whose flux extends up to the dm particle mass , from the hadronization and decay of the cascading annihilation products . in supersymmetric models ,",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum from neutralino annihilation is not uniquely determined and the branching ratios ( brs ) of the open annihilation channels are not determined since the dm particle field content is not known _",
    "a priori_. in contrast , in kaluza - klein scenarios where the lightest kaluza - klein particle ( lkp ) is the first kk mode of the hypercharge gauge boson , the brs of the annihilation channels can be computed given that the field content of the dm particle is known .",
    "the gamma - ray flux from annihilations of dm particles of mass @xmath1 accumulating in a spherical dm halo can be expressed in the form : @xmath2 as a product of a particle physics component with an astrophysics component .",
    "the particle physics part contains @xmath3 , the velocity - weighted annihilation cross section , and @xmath4 , the differential gamma - ray spectrum summed over the whole final states with their corresponding branching ratios .",
    "the astrophysical part corresponds to the line - of - sight - integrated squared density of the dm distribution j , averaged over the instrument solid angle @xmath5 usually matching the angular resolution of the instrument : @xmath6)ds \\hspace{2 cm } \\bar{j}(\\delta\\omega)\\,=\\,\\frac{1}{\\delta\\omega}\\,\\int_{\\delta\\omega } \\,psf\\times j\\ , d\\omega\\ ] ] where @xmath7 stands for the point spread function of the instrument .",
    "the annihilation rate being proportional to the square of the dm density integrated along the line of sight , regions with enhanced dm density are primary targets for indirect searches . among them are the galactic halo , external galaxies , galaxy clusters , substructures in galactic haloes , and the galactic center .",
    "we report here on recent results on dark matter searches with current iacts such as h.e.s.s . and magic , towards the galactic center , dwarf galaxies from the local group , galactic globular clusters and dm mini - spikes around intermediate mass black holes ( imbhs ) .",
