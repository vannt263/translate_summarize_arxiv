    "the mechanical luminosity of a stellar wind ( @xmath0 ; where @xmath1 is the mass loss rate and @xmath2 is the terminal speed of the wind ) is typically less than 1 per cent of the stellar radiative luminosity .",
    "the fast winds of massive stars have , however , a great influence to their surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "they sweep up the ism creating a variety of structures , from small bubbles around single stars to large superbubbles around ob associations .",
    "the interior of these bubbles or superbubbles contains shock - heated gas ( with temperatures in excess of @xmath3 k ) , thus emits strongly in x - rays , while the outer shell is cooler and bright in optical emission lines ( weaver et al .",
    "1977 ; mccray & kafatos , 1987 ; mac low & mccray , 1988 ; chu et al .",
    "1995 ) .    in the last decades , observations from old x - ray satellites such as the rosat , and",
    "newer ones , such as the chandra and xmm - newton observatories , have found diffuse x - ray emission inside ob massive star clusters .",
    "the diffuse x - ray region is associated to hot gas contained into a superbubble produced by the interaction of the individual ob stellar winds with the surrounding environment .",
    "nevertheless , extremely massive stars from the cluster would rapidly evolve into supernovae ( sne ) explosions , in which case the superbubble will be produced by the combined action of stellar winds and supernovae . in order to isolate the x - ray emission from stellar winds alone we can study very young superbubbles , where sne explosions are still not taking place .",
    "the superbubble m17 contains the massive stellar cluster ngc 6618 , with more than 800 stellar sources ( broos et al .",
    "this cluster has 100 stars earlier than b9 ( lada et al .",
    "1991 ) and an average age of @xmath4 myr ( hanson et al .",
    "with such a short age it is unlikely to have produced any sn explosion ; in a cluster with 100 o type stars the first sn explosion would occur after @xmath5 4 myr ( kndlseder et al . 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , m17 provides an ideal laboratory to observe and study the diffuse x - ray emission as produced by stellar wind collisions alone .",
    "this kind of superbubbles are called ` quiescent superbubbles ' .",
    "this superbubble is highly asymmetric due to the interaction with the edge of a massive molecular cloud , m17sw , located to the west of m17 ( lada et al .",
    "1974 ) . in this direction",
    "the bubble encounters resistance , while it can expand more freely to the east .",
    "this asymmetry is evident in a large - scale map of m17 at @xmath6 21 cm ( felli et al . 1984 ) , where two intersecting clouds or ` bars ' are observed in emission .",
    "these have been called the northern ( n ) and southern ( s ) bars . the projected size of each bar is of @xmath5 5.7 pc , forming an angle of @xmath7 with each other on the plane of the sky ( felli et al .",
    "1984 ; brogan & troland 2001 ) .     mag . ]",
    "the centre of the stellar cluster ngc 6618 consists of a ` ring ' of seven o - type stars ( hanson et al .",
    "1997 ) which are located between the two bars .",
    "these stars must be the dominant sources of ionising photons on the nebula , in fact diffuse x - ray emission is observed to be well confined within the external shell of the optical nebula ( dunne et al .",
    "figure [ f0 ] shown a dss image of this object .",
    "the ring of seven o - type stars is located on the west , where is substantial obscuring material , with @xmath8 mag ( hanson et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the stellar winds of these seven stars strongly contribute to the formation of a common ` stellar cluster wind ' @xcite .",
    "the collision of these winds with the surrounding inhomogeneous ism produces the diffuse x - ray emission observed by rosat and chandra satellites .    in rosat images ,",
    "m17 is observed as a blister - like structure , with an overall diameter of @xmath9 , if a distance of @xmath10 is considered ( nielbock et al .",
    "the emission peak is located inside the stellar cluster .",
    "this suggested that the cluster is the origin of the diffuse x - ray emission , and was later confirmed by chandra observations ( townsley et al .",
    "2003 ) , where the angular resolution allowed to see the individual sources .",
    "m17 was observed with rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) for @xmath11 ks in the @xmath12 kev band ( dunne et al .",
    "2003 ) . they found a total diffuse x - ray luminosity of @xmath13 with kt = 0.66 - 0.78 kev ( @xmath14 k ) and @xmath15 .",
    "several models have tried to reproduce the total x - ray luminosity @xmath16 from superbubbles , often taking into account the effects of the electron thermal conduction .",
    "however , the @xmath16 reproduced by models where thermal conduction is included ( weaver et al . 1977 ) is usually two or three orders of magnitude higher than the observed values , while models where thermal conduction is ignored predict a @xmath16 that is typically two orders of magnitude lower than observed .",
    "most of the time the descriptions are rather simple , they consider for instance that the cluster wind interacts with an homogeneous and isotropic ism , and neglect the effects of radiative cooling . for m17",
    "this approach is not adequate because it is a star forming region surrounded by asymmetrically distributed high density molecular clouds .    in this work we present three - dimensional numerical simulations based on the properties of m17 .",
    "the simulations were carried out with the adaptive grid code yguaz - a , and considered the main characteristics of the ism that surrounds m17 .",
    "synthetic thermal x - ray emission maps were obtained from the numerical results in order to compare the morphology and the total luminosity directly with rosat x - ray observations ( with a field of view of @xmath17 ) .",
    "this manuscript is organised in the following way : in section 2 we explain the modelling of m17 , the initial conditions of numerical simulations , and describes the simulation of the thermal x - ray emission ; an archival rosat image of this superbubble is presented in section 3 ; the results and comparison with observations are given in section 4 ; and finally in section 5 we summarise our conclusions .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the x - ray emission distribution for all models ( see figure  [ f3 ] ) show a general gradient , with lower emission to the left , in coincidence with the observations ( see figure  [ f4 ] ) .",
    "also in our models , on the left of the x - ray emitting material , strong emission is observed in form of filaments ( see figure  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "these filaments trace the shock front of champagne flow described above , propagating into the surrounding ism . in rosat observations , bright regions or ` clumps '",
    "can be seen to the east ( corresponding to the left , in our simulations ) .",
    "these clumps can be produced by the propagation of strong shock waves into an inhomogeneous medium .",
    "however , these features are smoother than those obtained from the simulations probably due to the difference between observed and simulated resolutions . to make a fair comparison we show in figure  [ f6 ] a smoothed synthetic map of model 2 , produced by convolving the numerical results with a gaussian beam in order to reproduce the same resolution of the rosat ( smoothed ) image in fig .",

    "_ bottom _ panel : smoothed image obtained after convolving with a gaussian function with a psf of @xmath19 pixels . ]     kev , smoothed with the same resolution of the rosat observation ( figure  [ f4 ] ) .",
    "the bar on the top is the logarithmic grey - scale , which is given in units of erg @xmath20 s@xmath21 sr@xmath21 .",
    "vertical and horizontal axis are given in units of pc . ]",
    "we carried out 3d numerical simulations using the adaptive grid code yguaz - a to model the m17 superbubble .",
    "radiative losses have been included in the simulations .",
    "three different runs of the same model were made using the known positions of the dominant wind sources on the plane of the sky ( corresponding to the @xmath22 positions in our cartesian grid ) , and considering three different distributions along the line of sight ( aligned with our @xmath23axis ) .",
    "our results show that the inclusion of the main features of the surrounding ism ( i.e. the presence of two dense bars or clouds around the m17 stars ) plays a crucial role to explain both the observed morphology and the total x - ray luminosity of this object .    on the one hand , the bars produces in all models a ` champagne ' flow effect , in which the resulting stellar cluster wind is focused by such bars , producing an elongated shape in the @xmath24  direction , thus reproducing the elongated shape in the east - west direction of the observations .",
    "on the other hand , the collision of the cluster wind with the bars maintains a high - temperature , high - density distribution in the region between the bars .",
    "this is a product of the multiple reflected shocks , and enhances the total x - ray luminosity ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we obtain values of the total x - ray luminosity of @xmath25 , which are in agreement with observations .",
    "the different @xmath23 stellar distributions employed in our runs had a rather small effect on both the morphology and @xmath16 .",
    "this could be somewhat expected , because the same mechanical luminosity input is used for all the runs , and because away of the cluster centre the common wind that forms should be similar .",
    "finally , it is noticeable that we obtain a reasonable estimate of the total x - ray luminosity without the need of including thermal conduction effects .",
