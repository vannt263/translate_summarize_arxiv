    "the quest for a geometrical description of phase transitions has a long history going back to ideas first put forward by onsager @xcite in the context of the @xmath0-transition in liquid @xmath1he .",
    "the relevant geometrical objects in this transition are topological line defects .",
    "the description envisaged by onsager is one entirely in terms of these 1-dimensional objects , with their geometrical properties such as fractal dimension and configurational entropy .",
    "the phase transition is characterized in this picture by a fundamental change in the typical string size .",
    "whereas in the superfluid phase only finite strings are present , at the critical point infinite strings appear  similar to the sudden appearance of a percolating cluster in percolation phenomena at criticality .",
    "the analogy between percolation of clusters and proliferation of strings has been noted by various authors @xcite . as we will see , it derives from a similarity in the cluster and string distribution .",
    "both have the same form containing two factors , one related to the entropy of a given cluster or string configuration , and the other related to the boltzmann weight assigned to the configuration .",
    "close to criticality , each of these factors is parametrized by a single exponent .",
    "one specifies the algebraic behavior of the distribution at criticality , while the other describes how the boltzmann factor tends to unity upon approaching the critical point .",
    "physically , the unity of the boltzmann factor implies that clusters or strings can grow and , thus , gain configurational entropy without energy cost . when the boltzmann factor is not unity , the clusters and strings are exponentially suppressed . in the context of strings ,",
    "the transition between a phase consisting of finite strings only and one having infinite strings , is called a hagedorn transition .",
    "we will refer to the appearance of infinite strings as proliferation .    a central position in our arguments is taken by an ideal bose gas with modified energy spectrum .",
    "the reason is that although noninteracting , the model has nontrivial critical exponents , which are known exactly , while at the same time it can also be mapped onto a loop gas of worldlines in an exact way .",
    "the worldlines form closed loops because in the absence of external fields and sources they can not terminate in the system .",
    "the map onto the loop gas allows us to connect the critical exponents of the phase transition to the two exponents parameterizing the worldline loop distribution near criticality . using general scaling relations , these results",
    "can then be generalized to interacting loop gases representing statistical models .",
    "each universality class is defined by a loop distribution with specific values for the two exponents from which all the critical exponents follow .    to close the circle ,",
    "the resulting loop gas description of critical phenomena can also be applied to phase transitions involving ( interacting ) vortex loops  like the @xmath0-transition in liquid @xmath1he .",
    "as for worldlines , vortices can not terminate in the system and , therefore , form closed loops too . when the word string is used in the following ,",
    "the two different 1-dimensional objects worldlines and vortices should be kept in mind .    as an aside ,",
    "we believe that the theory of vertex loop gases discussed here has also a bearing on homogeneous superfluid turbulence .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",

    "in this section , we briefly recall some basic aspects of percolation theory @xcite which are important for our purposes . consider a lattice , with each lattice site being randomly occupied with a probability @xmath2 , say , independent of its neighbors .",
    "island of next - neighboring occupied sites form clusters .",
    "the properties of these clusters as a function of @xmath2 form the subject of percolation theory  or more precisely , of _ uncorrelated _ percolation theory because the occupations of different lattice sites are uncorrelated . as @xmath2 increases ,",
    "clusters become bigger , and at some critical value @xmath3 , a cluster spanning the entire lattice first appears . near this percolation threshold ,",
    "various quantities show power - law behavior . as for thermal critical phenomena",
    ", this behavior can be characterized by a set of critical exponents of which two are independent .    of interest to us",
    "is the so - called percolation strength @xmath4 defined for @xmath5 as the probability that a randomly chosen site belongs to the percolating cluster , the average cluster size @xmath6 , and the correlation length @xmath7 .",
    "we give some quantities a subscript `` per '' to avoid confusion later on , where similar , but different quantities appear .",
    "the percolation strength is analogous to the magnetization in spin models , while the average cluster size corresponds to the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the number density of clusters having size @xmath8 , i.e. , with @xmath8 occupied sites , is assumed to be distributed according to @xmath9 where the coefficient @xmath10 vanishes with an exponent @xmath11 when the percolation threshold @xmath3 is approached from below @xmath12 . at criticality ,",
    "the cluster distribution becomes @xmath13 and falls off algebraically .",
    "this factor measures the configurational entropy of clusters , while the exponential is a boltzmann factor .",
    "together with the so - called fisher exponent @xmath14 , the exponent @xmath15 determines the critical exponents , such as @xmath16 and @xmath17 through scaling relations .    in terms of the cluster distribution @xmath18 ,",
    "the average cluster size is given by @xmath19 where only finite clusters are included in the sum .",
    "to understand that @xmath20 thus defined indeed is a measure for the average cluster size , note that the combination @xmath21 in the denominator is the probability that a randomly chosen site belongs to a cluster of size @xmath8 . when summed over @xmath8 ,",
    "this gives the probability that the randomly chosen site belongs to a cluster of arbitrary ( finite ) size .",
    "the ratio @xmath22 is therefore the probability that the cluster to which the randomly chosen site belongs is of size @xmath8 .",
    "when this ratio is multiplied with the cluster size and summed over @xmath8 , one obtains indeed a measure of the average cluster size . with the explicit expression for @xmath20",
    "one easily finds that @xmath23 for later reference , recall that the susceptibility also equals the integral over the correlation function @xmath24 of the system under consideration . because of eq .",

    "( [ s ] ) for @xmath20 , one uses the identity @xmath32 stating that an occupied site either belongs to the percolating cluster or to a finite one .",
    "hence , for @xmath5 @xmath33 and @xmath34 below the percolation threshold , @xmath35 , so that the identity becomes @xmath36 .    given the analogy with spin systems , it should be possible to define a partition function @xmath37 from which the percolation strength ( magnetization ) and the average cluster size ( susceptibility ) can be obtained by differentiation .",

    "beyond the upper critical dimension @xmath48 , the critical exponents are locked in their values at @xmath49 . for percolation , as we will see below , the upper critical dimension is @xmath50 .",
    "another scaling relation between the various critical exponents is obtained from the expressions ( [ sumgper ] ) and ( [ algebraic ] ) involving the correlation function . using @xmath51 as lower cutoff in the integral",
    ", one finds @xmath52 which in the context of thermal phase transitions is known fisher s scaling law .",
    "the correlation length exponent @xmath17 is known to have a geometric meaning , being related to the hausdorff , or fractal dimension @xmath53 at criticality .",

    "a standard definition of the correlation length in terms of the correlation function @xmath59 , with @xmath60 , reads @xmath61 it measures the average distance between two sites in the same cluster .",
    "because of the observation ( [ sumgper ] ) , this definition can be transcribed in terms of the cluster distribution as @xmath62 with eq .  ( [ hausdorff ] ) , the relation between the correlation length and the fractal dimension is then easily found to be @xmath63 combined with this relation , the hyperscaling relation ( [ josephson ] ) leads to the well - known expression for the fisher exponent @xmath14 in terms of the fractal dimension : @xmath64 using a flory - type @xcite of argument known from polymer physics and the theory of self - avoiding walks @xcite , de gennes @xcite estimated the fractal dimension for uncorrelated site percolation to be @xmath65 in fig .",

    "this result can be understood @xcite by realizing that a dense random network was simulated , where a single vortex experiences an effective repulsion from the neighboring vortex segments as the volume occupied by these segments is not available anymore .",
    "the situation is similar to a polymer in a dense solution , which also displays the structure of a brownian random walk .    without any external field ,",
    "all phase values of the order parameter have equal probability .",
    "vachaspati @xcite lifted this degeneracy of the vacuum manifold by giving some values a bias , thus obstructing the formation of vortices and decreasing the vortex density .",
    "when studying the statistics of the random network as function of the bias , a threshold was found , above which infinite vortices are absent and finite loops exponentially suppressed .",
    "the sudden appearance of infinite vortices as the threshold is approached from the low - density side , was interpreted as a percolation process .",
    "strobl and hindmarsh @xcite carried out more extensive numerical simulations on the transition of a random string network triggered by changing the bias .",
    "using the percolation set of critical exponents , they measured  to within statistical errors  values similar to those for 3-dimensional uncorrelated site percolation , which has @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 @xcite . for the vortex loops ,",
    "the value @xmath165 means that they are self - seeking .",
    "the conclusion that the phase transition of a random string network is identical to the uncorrelated percolation transition is precisely what one would expect given our observations of the last section .",
    "up to this point we considered only _ uncorrelated _ site percolation , where lattice sites were occupied at random , and nearest - neighboring occupied sites grouped together in clusters .",
    "however , as is known from work on the ising model @xcite , this is not the whole story .    in the context of the ising model",
    ", it is more appropriate to refer to occupied sites as sites with spin up , say . in general",
    ", the percolation threshold temperature is below the critical one .",
    "that is to say , already before the thermal phase transition is reached , clusters of spin - up sites percolate the lattice . only on a 2-dimensional square lattice ,",
    "the site percolation threshold temperature coincides with the critical temperature . despite this , the ising - model and percolation critical exponents are different  as in higher dimensions .",
    "the situation is similar to the one discussed at the end of sec.[sec : bec ] , with the percolation transition being in a different universality class as the thermal one .",
    "it is nevertheless possible to modify the definition of clusters in such a way that the critical behavior of the modified clusters becomes identical to that of the ising model @xcite .",
    "this approach goes back to seminal work by fortuin and kasteleyn @xcite , who mapped the partition function of the ising model onto a _",
    "correlated _ percolation problem . to obtain a modified cluster ,",
    "take two nearest - neighboring sites @xmath166 of a standard cluster with all the spins up , and add the pair to the new cluster with the bond probability @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the spin - spin coupling of the ising model .",
    "the factor @xmath169 appearing here corresponds to the increase in energy when one of the two spins involved in the bond is flipped .",
    "the upshot is that the bond clusters are in general smaller than the standard ones and also more loosely connected .",
    "the bond clusters percolate right at the critical temperature and display critical behavior identical to that of the ising model .",
    "the method has been turned into a powerful monte carlo algorithm by swendson and wang@xcite , and by wolff @xcite , where not individual spins are updated , but entire clusters .",
    "the main advantage of the nonlocal cluster algorithm in comparison to a local update algorithm , like metropolis or heat bath , is that it drastically reduces the critical slowing down near the critical point .",
    "very recently , also the critical behavior of the 3-dimensional o(@xmath103 ) spin models , with @xmath170 , was described as a correlated percolation process @xcite .",
    "the relevant clusters percolate at the critical temperature , and were shown to have the same critical exponents as the corresponding models .",
    "in the same way that correlated percolation can describe thermal phase transitions of interacting systems also correlated worldline loop gases can .",
    "recall that the loop gas description of an ideal bose gas hinged on the representation ( [ explicit ] ) of the partition function in terms of the loop distribution ( [ loopdisgen ] ) , which derived from the representation ( [ kint ] ) as an integral over momentum .",
    "if we assume that near the critical point , the partition function of an interacting system can be put in a similar form , but with @xmath171 replaced by the single - particle spectrum of the excitation that becomes critical at @xmath101 , the integral can in principle be done , yielding some loop distribution @xmath172 , with @xmath91 physically denoting the number of times a worldline loop wraps around the imaginary time axis . as for the ideal bose gas , this distribution",
    "is parametrized by two exponents @xmath15 and @xmath14 , and can be put in the general form ( [ loopdisgen ] ) , with values characteristic for the universality class under consideration . the string tension of the worldline loops vanishes at @xmath101 , and loops with arbitrarily large winding number @xmath91 appear in the system , signalling the onset of bose - einstein condensation in the low - temperature phase .",
    "note that the representation ( [ kint ] ) of the partition function as an integral over momentum does not require a nonrelativistic theory .",
    "also relativistic theories lead to a similar form for the ( equilibrium ) partition function at finite temperature @xcite , as it is essentially fixed by bose statistics .",
    "the generalization of the sum rule ( [ sumg ] ) to correlated worldline loop gases reads @xmath173 where we recall that the string tension behaves near the critical point as @xmath174 .",
    "the sum rule leads directly to the relation @xmath175 while at criticality , with the long distance cutoff @xmath68 , corresponding to @xmath176 as before , it gives the relation @xmath177 these two relations generalize the corresponding results in eq.([ces ] ) for an ideal bose gas with modified energy spectrum . the value @xmath178 separates self - avoiding worldlines ( @xmath179 ) from self - seeking ones . since the fractal dimension has to be positive and smaller than the dimension @xmath29 of the embedding space @xcite , @xmath180 .",
    "translated in terms of limits on @xmath14 , it follows that @xmath181 for self - seeking worldlines , while @xmath182 for self - avoiding ones .",
    "note that in two space dimensions and below , no self - seeking strings are possible .    as in sec .",
    "[ sec : bec ] , the exponents here are those for describing the thermal phase transition of a loop gas of strings ( worldlines ) .",
    "they are to be distinguished from the ones defined in the context of percolation theory given in ( [ perce ] ) .",
    "the two sets have , however , the exponents @xmath43 and @xmath17 in common , implying that the present set can also be expressed entirely in terms of the exponents @xmath15 and @xmath14 parameterizing the loop distribution ( [ loopdisgen ] ) . indeed",

    "in this paper we discussed the close analogy between percolation of ( correlated ) clusters and proliferation of strings at thermal phase transitions of interacting systems .",

    "if the loops are finite - temperature worldlines , their proliferation signals the formation of a bose - einstein condensate which spontaneously breaks the global symmetry characteristic of the phase transition under consideration .",
    "if , on the other hand , the loops are vortices , their proliferation signals the disordering of the ordered state in which these vortices are topologically stable .    in deriving our results we used the ideal bose gas with modified energy spectrum as a stepping stone .",
    "the model , despite being noninteracting , has nontrivial critical exponents which are known exactly .",
    "it also has the virtue that it can be mapped onto a loop gas in an exact way .",
    "the resulting relations between the exponents parameterizing the loop distribution and the critical exponents describing the thermal phase transition of the system were shown to be easily generalized to interacting loop gases using general scaling laws . as for percolation , the two exponents parameterizing the distribution were shown to encode the entire set of critical exponents .",
    "various statistical models with exactly known critical exponents were discussed from the perspective of a worldline loop gas .",
    "also recent numerical studies on the statistical properties of the vortex loop gas in the 3-dimensional xy - model were discussed .",
