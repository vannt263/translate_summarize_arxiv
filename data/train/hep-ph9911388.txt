    "the continuing agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions on almost all the electroweak variables has further solidified the standard model ( sm ) . however , there are signs of perhaps something non - standard from the investigation of non - electroweak variables and the indication of possibilities of new physics from electroweak variables themselves as well . on the one hand , the accumulative and ,",
    "especially , the recent data on neutrino oscillations have strongly suggested the fact of finite neutrino masses @xcite and , therefore , the sm has to be modified . on the other hand , the @xmath6-pole measurements at lep / sld on the @xmath0 forward - backward asymmetry gives a value of @xmath7 which deviates from the sm prediction by @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "if this @xmath3 anomaly is not a statistical or systematic effect , it signals the presence of new physics in association with the @xmath1 coupling .",
    "meanwhile , the experimental value of the related quantity @xmath9 , after showing a deviation from the standard model ( sm ) value for a few years , now agrees well with the sm prediction @xcite . to explain the current experimental values of both @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the required new physics contribution has to shift the left- and right - handed @xmath1 couplings by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively@xcite .",
    "recently efforts have been made in exploring the @xmath3 anomaly , either in explaining the effect in specified models @xcite or in examining its implications for low energy decay processes @xcite .",
    "the popular low energy susy and the models in which the third generation feels a different gauge dynamics from the usual weak interaction can not yield such large anomalous @xmath12 coupling , as showed in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "these studies are focused on the theme that has been emerged since the discovery of the heavy top quark , that new physics is most likely related to the gauge symmetry breaking sector and , therefore , may affect the interactions of the third family quarks most significantly .    from the overwhelming success of the sm at the electroweak scale , one can conclude that the underlying theory of the new physics can openly manifest only at a higher energy scale .",
    "one can envisage in the scheme of a larger symmetry that encompasses the new physics , after integrating out the heavy degrees of freedom which lie outside the sm spectrum , higher dimensional terms will be present at energies not too far above the electroweak scale and the induced effective terms should preserve the basic sm structure",
    ". then the new physics effects on the @xmath1 couplings can be parameterized by a set of higher dimensional operators @xcite which are @xmath2 symmetric before the electroweak symmetry breaking becomes explicit . from the above argument",
    "we see that before the electroweak symmetry breaking , the @xmath1 part of the effective lagrangian can take the general form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the sm part , @xmath15 is the new physics scale , @xmath16 are dimension - six sm gauge invariant operators , and @xmath17 are constants which represent the coupling strengths of @xmath16 .",
    "we have assumed that operators of higher dimensions than 6 are suppressed by powers of @xmath18 , so eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) is a quite general parameterization of new physics .",
    "since there are many possible higher dimensional operators @xmath16 , it is important to use various experimental data to constrain the operator form in order to narrow down the directions of the underlying theory . because the operator @xmath16 can contribute to several vertices after @xmath19 symmetry breaking",
    ", these operators can contribute to and will show correlated effects on several different physical observables .",
    "it will become clear later that the new physics effects required to explain @xmath3 will also show up in other observables , such as @xmath0 production at lep ii , @xmath5 production at nlc , and @xmath20 production at the tevatron .",

    "these effects are summarized in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "a few remarks regarding to the results in table [ tab3 ] are appropriate :    ( a ) : :    the right - handed operator @xmath37 has large effects on    @xmath4 and @xmath124 at lep ii due to two    reasons : one is that it contributes to the    @xmath134 coupling and the    @xmath135 intermediate state gives the dominant    contribution to @xmath136 at lep ii .",
    "the    other is that the effects of @xmath37 are enhanced by a    factor @xmath137 , which is 4.3 for    @xmath138 gev at lep ii , due to its momentum dependent    couplings .",
    "the preliminary lep ii data at @xmath138    gev give @xcite @xmath139 note the large    statistical error in @xmath140 . at the    @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) level the new physics    effects are limited to the following ranges    @xmath141    from table [ tab3 ] we see that the minimum contributions of    @xmath37 , when it is used together with any one of the    left - handed operators , lie outside the allowed ranges in eqs .",
    "( [ eq24 ] )    and ( [ eq25 ] ) at the @xmath86 level .",
    "hence the    right - handed operator @xmath37 is disfavored unless the    central values of both @xmath142 and    @xmath140 are modified in the refined lep ii data    analysis .",
    "the operator @xmath38 , which is neither    momentum dependent nor contributes to the    @xmath134 coupling , makes much smaller    contributions to @xmath4 and @xmath143 at lep    ii . as shown in table [ tab3 ] , when @xmath38 is used    together with a left - handed operator the deviation from the sm is    allowed by the preliminary lep ii data .",
    "( b ) : :    the left - handed operator , @xmath62 , when used to fit the    anomalous @xmath23 coupling at the    @xmath6-pole , can give rise to a sizable effect in the cross    section for @xmath127 at the fermilab    tevatron because its effect on @xmath144 is enhanced by    a factor @xmath145 ( @xmath146 is    the center - of - mass energy of the parton - level process    @xmath147 ) .",
    "moreover , both    @xmath62 and @xmath63 can cause large effects    in the production rate of @xmath5 pairs at the nlc    because their anomalous @xmath148 coupling is    enhanced by a factor @xmath149 for    @xmath150 gev at the nlc . note that the effect of    @xmath63 is about a factor two larger than that of    @xmath62 .",
    "( c ) : :    due to the clean environment and anticipated large number of the top    pair events at the nlc it is possible to measure the top pair    production rate at the level of a few percent@xcite .",
    "so the    @xmath5 production rate decrease caused by    @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , with the minimum    @xmath87 limit of 3.7% ( 7.2% ) , should be observable at    the @xmath87 level .",
    "in contrast , due to the backgrounds    at hadron colliders , it will be challenging to measure the single top    production rate at the level of a few percent@xcite at the tevatron .",
    "the decrease of the single top production rate caused by    @xmath62 , with the minimum    @xmath86(@xmath87 ) limit of 15% ( 3% ) , should    be observable at the @xmath86 level , but probably not at    the @xmath87 level . a detailed monte carlo analysis , with    the consideration of all possible backgrounds , showed @xcite that the    effects of @xmath62 on the single top production rate are    observable at run 3 , or run 2b , ( 30 fb@xmath151 luminosity )    at the @xmath87 level for    @xmath152 .",
    "consequently , the effects    of @xmath62 , with coupling strength in the    @xmath87 range ,    @xmath153 in eq.([limit2 ] ) , will only    marginally be observable in run 3 , or run 2b , at the tevatron .",
    "( d ) : :    among the left - handed operators the two operators that involve the    higgs field , @xmath154 and    @xmath155 , together with the right - handed    operator , @xmath38 , which also involve the higgs    field , indeed , do provide the required contribution to    @xmath23 coupling but cause only small effects at    lep ii , the nlc , and the upgraded tevatron ; only a few percent    deviation from the sm in the @xmath156 forward - backward    asymmetry at lep ii .",
    "we have examined in some detail the possibility of new physics , characterized by higher dimension operators , if the current data on the @xmath21 couplings at the @xmath6-pole are taken literally .",
    "the dimension six operators we considered consist of two right - handed operators and four left - handed ones . both the right- and left - handed operators are needed to explain the data .",
    "we also examined the effects of the eight pairs of operator at high energy colliders , lep ii , nlc , and upgraded tevatron .",
    "since the operators have sufficiently different behaviors at these higher energy colliders , their effects can mostly be distinguished , as can be seen from table [ tab3 ] . in particular , the preliminary lep ii data disfavor four pairs of these operators , all of which involve the right - handed operator @xmath37 .",
    "the four pairs which contain the operator @xmath38 also behave differently .",
    "the pair @xmath38 and @xmath62 has only small effects on @xmath157 and @xmath158 but observable effects on @xmath159 production at the nlc and single top production at the upgraded tevatron .",
    "the pair @xmath38 and @xmath63 has a strong effect on @xmath159 production at the nlc , and an observable effect on @xmath158 , but a negligible effect on @xmath157 and no observable effects at the tevatron .",
    "the remaining two pairs , @xmath38 and @xmath160 and @xmath38 and @xmath161 , have very little effect on the high energy quantities under consideration , except for a few percent deviation from the sm in @xmath143 .",
    "however , since these operators all contain the higgs field and , therefore , are related to the symmetry breaking sector , they may well have something to do with new physics ; at least , our analysis indicates they are the most likely suspects . the @xmath162 production at the nlc ,",
    "@xmath163 , or @xmath164 , are useful processes for detecting their existence , as these operators can induce anomalous four - point couplings : @xmath165 and @xmath166 . however , the production rates for such processes depend on the higgs mass , which awaits discover .    in our analyses",
    "we have considered one pair of right- and left - handed operators at a time .",
    "if the two right - handed operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 are considered together @xmath167 will be strongly constrained by the lep ii data for the reasons discussed in remark ( a ) of the previous section . then the effects of @xmath37 on the lep i observables will be suppressed relative to these of @xmath38 .",
    "thus @xmath38 will remain to explain the lep i data and our previous conclusion that @xmath38 is the favored candidate for the right - handed new physics operator in the @xmath1 couplings is not changed .",
    "similarly , if we consider the four left - handed operators together we can obtain a bound on a linear combination of their coupling coefficients from the lep i data . from top pair production at the nlc",
    "we can distinguish @xmath62 and @xmath63 from the other two .",
    "from single top production at the upgraded tevatron we might also be able to single out @xmath62 .",
    "however , it will be difficult to distinguish @xmath154 from @xmath155 .    in conclusion ,",
    "if new physics effects exist in the @xmath1 vertex , as indicated by the current measurements at the @xmath6-pole , then : ( 1 ) the responsible right - handed operator could only be @xmath38 , to be consistent with the lep ii data .",
    "( 2 ) the responsible left - handed operators can be distinguished by measuring @xmath159 production rate at the nlc and single top production at the tevatron .",
    "( 3 ) it is most likely that any new physics in @xmath1 couplings will involve the higgs sector .",
