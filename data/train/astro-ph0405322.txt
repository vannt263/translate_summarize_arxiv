    "submillimetre ( submm ) galaxies are the key to understand the process of galaxy formation ( e.g. smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; hughes et al .",
    "1998 ; eales et al . 1999 ; scott et al . 2002 ) .",
    "it has been found that submm galaxies are massive starburst galaxies at high redshifts ; i.e. gas mass is estimated to be as large as @xmath1 m@xmath2 from the co line emission ( frayer et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; ivison et al . 2001 ; genzel et al . 2003 ; neri et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the median redshift of @xmath3 is recently found spectroscopically ( chapman et al .",
    "if observed submm fluxes originate mainly from star formation , the star formation rates ( sfrs ) of bright submm galaxies are estimated to be over @xmath4 m@xmath2 yr@xmath5 ( e.g. smail et al .",
    "2002 ; chapman et al .",
    "2003a ) , large enough to produce a massive elliptical galaxy ( @xmath6 @xmath0 ) within @xmath7 gyr ( comparable to the hubble time at @xmath8 ) .",
    "this estimate seems to be confirmed with the follow - up observations at x - ray , which suggest the negligible contribution of the agn to submm fluxes ( alexander et al .",
    "these observations indicate that submm galaxies are the most plausible candidates of the progenitors of present - day elliptical galaxies .    the evolutionary link between submm galaxies and elliptical galaxies is also suggested by the statistical properties of submm galaxies .",
    "the comoving number density of submm galaxies with the 850 @xmath9 m flux of @xmath10 mjy is comparable to that of present - day ellipticals with @xmath11 3  4 @xmath0 ( chapman et al .",
    "another clue to the evolutionary link could be given by the clustering properties of submm galaxies , which should be strong if they are the progenitors of massive elliptical galaxies .",
    "this would be tested by large submm surveys in near future .",
    "theoretically , the semi - analytic methods ( sams ) are extensively applied to explain the statistical properties of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. baugh et al .",
    "1996 ; kauffmann et al . 1996",
    "; cole et al .",
    "2000 ; benson et al .",
    "2001 ; diaferio et al .",
    "2001 ; springel et al .",
    "the sams show that most of massive galaxies are formed at @xmath12 as a result of successive merging of smaller objects .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to explain the statistical properties of submm galaxies with the standard sams .",
    "this problem comes from the uncertainty in the relation between the dynamical evolution of the dark matter and the star formation processes in the early stage of galaxy formation ( e.g. binney 2004 ) . in order to avoid this uncertainty",
    ", we may need an alternative method to investigate the evolutionary link between submm galaxies and elliptical galaxies .",
    "elliptical galaxies are known as a fairly homogeneous family ; e.g. they exhibit very small scatter in the colour - magnitude relation ( e.g. bower et al .",
    "1992 ) and the relation between the @xmath13 index and the velocity dispersion @xmath14 ( dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) , i.e. , their properties are well characterized as a sequence of mass .",
    "it is also remarkable that they occupy a two - dimensional sheet ( fundamental plane ) in the three dimensional space defined by the velocity dispersion @xmath14 , the effective radius @xmath15 , and the mean surface brightness within @xmath15 ( dressler et al .",
    "1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) .",
    "if submm galaxies evolve into elliptical galaxies , their present - day properties must be consistent with these scaling relations .",
    "this kind of test can provide the other piece of evidence for the evolutionary link between submm galaxies and elliptical galaxies .    in this paper , we analyse submm galaxies with an evolutionary model of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for starburst galaxies , which is presented by takagi , arimoto & hanami ( 2003a ; hereafter tah03 ) . in this model ,",
    "the chemical evolution of starburst region is considered ; i.e. if we specify the evolutionary phase of submm galaxies as starbursts , gas mass and stellar mass of submm galaxies can be estimated , together with their chemical abundances .",
    "also , the intrinsic size of starburst region can be estimated from the observed seds , since the geometry of starburst region determines its optical depth for a given dust mass . by using this model ,",
    "we predict the present - day colour , magnitude and size of submm galaxies from observed seds , and produce the present - day scaling relations for submm galaxies , i.e. the colour - magnitude relation and the size - magnitude relation .",
    "then , these scaling relations are compared with those of elliptical galaxies , in order to prove the evolutionary link between submm galaxies and elliptical galaxies .",
    "this approach is new and complementary to the previous studies .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe practical methods of sed diagnostics of submm galaxies in section 2 .",
    "we summarise the results of sed fitting in section 3 .",
    "we confront the predicted present - day characteristics of submm galaxies with those of present - day elliptical galaxies in section 4 .",
    "then , we discuss a possible evolutionary scenario of submm galaxies in section 5 .",
    "our conclusions are given in section 6 . throughout this paper , we adopt the cosmology of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 km sec@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "we consider the evolution of starburst regions in submm galaxies .",
    "each starburst region is assumed to be a dynamically isolated system in which the chemical enrichment proceeds with effective mixing of gas by supernova feedback .",
    "the sed of such starburst region is determined by the starburst age for a given star formation history and the spatial distribution of stars and dust , i.e. geometry .",
    "the adopted sed model is the same as the model applied to nearby starbursts in tah03 , except for the initial metallicity and the initial mass function ( imf ) . here",
    "we briefly describe this sed model .",
    "we approximate the star formation history in a starburst region with an infall model of arimoto , yoshii & takahara ( 1992 ) . in this model ,",
    "the overall star formation history is described with two time - scales , i.e. the gas infall time - scale @xmath19 and the star formation time - scale @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt the simplest case , in which a starburst is characterized by only one evolutionary time - scale @xmath21 , i.e. , we assume @xmath22 . thus , we specify the star formation history with @xmath21 , which is important only for the absolute time - scale of starburst events .",
    "note that the chemical evolution as a function of @xmath23 is almost independent of the practical choice of @xmath21 ( tah03 ) .",
    "since this is also true for the properties of the sed , specifically when @xmath24 myr , we can derive the chemical properties of starbursts from the observed sed , irrespective of the adopted value of @xmath21 ( i.e. the star formation history ) .",
    "practically , all models are calculated with @xmath25 myr . once the starburst age ( @xmath23 ) is specified with the total mass of initial gas @xmath26",
    ", we can derive the gas mass @xmath27 and stellar mass @xmath28 in the starburst region , together with the metallicities of gas and stars .",
    "we assume that the metallicity of pre - galactic gas clouds @xmath29 is negligibly small ( i.e. @xmath29=0 ) .",
    "it is possible that pre - galactic gas clouds are chemically enriched with the former star formation activity .",
    "however , our conclusions are independent of practical choice of @xmath29 when @xmath30 .",
    "a simple model of dust evolution is adopted ; i.e. we assume that the dust - to - metal ratio @xmath31 is constant .",
    "the value of @xmath31 depends on the dust model .",
    "we adopt three dust models , i.e. the model for dust in the milky way ( mw ) , lmc and smc . for the mw , lmc and smc , the values of @xmath31 derived from the extinction curve and the spectra of cirrus emission are 0.40 , 0.55 , and 0.75 , respectively .",
    "see tah03 and takagi , vanseviius , & arimoto ( 2003b ) in detail .",
    "we assume that stars in submm galaxies are centrally concentrated as those in elliptical galaxies .",
    "the stellar density distribution is given by the king profile with log(@xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the cut - off and core radius , respectively , and the adopted value is typical for elliptical galaxies ( combes et al .",
    "1995 ) . as in tah03",
    ", dust is assumed to distribute homogeneously within @xmath33 .",
    "note that tah03 show that the effective radii of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) derived from seds are consistent with the observed ones at @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37-band . in this geometry ,",
    "the longer the observed wavelength , the smaller the observed effective radius , so far as the observed flux is dominated by stellar emissions .",
    "this is because stars in the central region contribute to the observed flux more and more with decreasing the optical depth .",
    "tah03 also show that this trend is consistent with the observations of ulirgs .",
    "therefore , the adopted geometry is found to be suitable for nearby ulirgs .",
    "since the amount of dust is given by the chemical evolution , the geometry of starburst region determines the optical depth by dust .",
    "therefore , one of the important parameters of this sed model is a compactness factor @xmath38 of starburst regions , defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is adopted , resulting in the constant surface brightness for constant @xmath38 .",
    "note that the sed feature is preserved for different values of @xmath28 when @xmath40 , since the source function within the starburst is conserved .",
    "the optical depth of starburst regions , here defined with the column density of dust measured from the centre to outer edge , is a function of starburst age and @xmath38 . by using @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath38 derived from the sed fitting , we calculate the intrinsic effective radius @xmath41 ( i.e. effective radius with no dust ) , which is given by 10.75@xmath42 in the adopted geometry .    in section 4.2 , we point out that massive submm galaxies may consist of multiple starburst regions .",
    "so far , photometric data are available only for a whole galaxy especially at longer wavelengths .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to analyse the sed of each starburst region .",
    "if the sed of starburst regions in submm galaxies is similar to each other , the derived starburst age and @xmath38 for a whole galaxy can be interpreted as those of each starburst region .",
    "this condition is such that each starburst is triggered almost simultaneously and the intrinsic bolometric surface brightness of each starburst region is similar to each other , like nearby self - regulated starbursts ( tah03 ) .",
    "a population synthesis code developed by kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) is used to calculate the spectral evolution of stellar populations . in this model , the effects of stellar metallicity are explicitly taken into account in spectra .",
    "this is important to consistently calculate spectra of passively evolving galaxies , which mainly depend on the metallicity and the age of stellar population ( worthey 1994 ) .",
    "we adopt the two imfs , i.e. the salpeter imf with the power raw index of @xmath43 ( imf@xmath44 ) , and a top - heavy imf with the flatter slope @xmath45 ( imf@xmath46 ) .",
    "such a flat imf has been suggested by kodama & arimoto ( 1997 ) for elliptical galaxies , and found for the ob associations in the milky way ( massey et al .",
    "for both the imfs , we adopt the lower and upper mass limit of 0.1 m@xmath2 and 60 m@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the choice of imf is important for the present - day magnitudes of submm galaxies , since the mass - to - light ratio is smaller for the flatter imf . also , the present - day colours of submm galaxies depend on the imf , since the yield of chemical enrichment is higher for the flatter imf .",
    "the sed from uv to submm of starburst regions is calculated for each starburst age , @xmath38 and the extinction curve ( mw , lmc and smc ) , by using the code for the radiative transfer used by tah03 . in this code , isotropic multiple scattering is assumed and the self - absorption of re - emitted energy from dust is fully taken into account . the temperature of dust grains is calculated for each dust size and constituent at each radial grid .",
    "for very small grains , the temperature fluctuation is calculated consistently with the radiative transfer .",
    "see takagi et al .",
    "( 2003b ) in detail .",
    "the sample includes extremely red objects ( eros ) detected at the mir ",
    "submm wavelengths , submm galaxies found with scuba blank field surveys , submm galaxies amplified by the gravitational lens , submm galaxies in the proto - cluster region , and host galaxies of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) detected at the submm wavelengths . although 3 of _ iso_-detected eros do not have observed flux at submm wavelengths , we call the sample galaxies as submm galaxies for simplicity .",
    "we consider submm galaxies which have spectroscopic redshifts only .",
    "therefore , the secure optical identification is inevitable .",
    "the spectroscopic redshift is necessary to significantly reduce the uncertainty of the sed fitting . also , the sample galaxies need to have extensive photometric data enough to perform the sed fitting .",
    "we consider galaxies which have more than 3 photometric data in the optical - nir bands . in total",
    ", we collect 23 galaxies detected at submm wavelengths and 3 _ iso_-detected eros from the literature ( including private communication ) .",
    "the observed properties of the sample galaxies are summarised in table 1 . in appendix",
    "a , we summarise the observations of the sample galaxies . for smmj02399 - 0136 , we perform the sed fitting with two possible optical counterparts l1 and l2 ( ivison et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the best - fitting sed model is searched by the @xmath47 minimization technique from a prepared set of sed models .",
    "we calculate the sed models for 10 different starburst ages ( @xmath48  6.0 ) and 16 different compactness factors ( @xmath38=0.3  3.0 ) for each type of extinction curve ; i.e. the best - fitting sed model is selected from a total of 480 sed models .",
    "this model set is made for both imf@xmath44 and imf@xmath46 .",
    "the upper limits of flux are taken into account in the fitting process , i.e. models exceeding the 3 @xmath14 upper limits are simply rejected .",
    "the fitting results with imf@xmath44 and imf@xmath46 are summarised in table 2a and 2b , respectively .",
    "the results of sed fitting are shown in figure [ sed ] for imf@xmath46 which is more suitable for submm galaxies than imf@xmath44 ( see section 4 ) .",
    "note that the fitting parameters are @xmath23 and @xmath38 with the choice of the extinction curve .",
    "the normalization of the sed model is adjusted by @xmath26 .",
    "the rest quantities are derived from the best - fitting sed model . in appendix b",
    ", we show the contour maps of @xmath49 for the sample used in the main analysis given in section 4 and 5 . also , the typical values of estimated errors are shown in figure [ cm_uv ] , [ kormendy ] , and [ lbol ] .",
    "table 3 summarises the results of sed fitting , giving the number of galaxies for each bin of age and optical depth , and the resulting extinction curve .",
    "we find that @xmath50 % of submm galaxies have @xmath51 , in a marked contrast to nearby starbursts , showing only @xmath5223 % have @xmath51 .",
    "thus , a significant fraction of submm galaxies are found to be young .",
    "the optical depth @xmath53 of submm galaxies has a peak at 10  20 , which is similar to that of nearby ulirgs ( cf .",
    "the large fraction of apparently young starbursts in submm galaxies may be caused by an extra agn contribution to the rest - frame uv light .",
    "since we have no further information on the presence of agn for most of submm galaxies , we hereafter assume that they are intrinsically young",
    ". this assumption does not change our main conclusions which are derived from old ( @xmath54 submm galaxies .",
    "eros detected in the mir ",
    "submm wavelengths are found to be the oldest starburst galaxies ( @xmath55 ) in the sample .",
    "this means that colours of stellar populations should be intrinsically red , in order to reproduce extremely red colours .",
    "note that the derived stellar masses for eros are systematically higher than those of the other sample , due to higher mass - to - light ratio .    grb host galaxies ( 2 out of 3 ) have unique seds characterized by young stellar populations ( @xmath56 ) and large optical depth ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "although their optical depths are the largest among our sample , the optical / nir seds are not very red .",
    "this is because only stars near the surface of the starburst region actually contribute to the observed uv - nir sed in such a large @xmath53 .",
    "spectroscopic observations and x - ray detections suggest that 6 sample galaxies ( eroj164023 , isoj1324 - 2016 , pdfj011423 , cudss14.13 , smmj02399 - 0136 and smmj02399 - 0134 ) harbour agn . as a result of sed fitting",
    ", we find a clear mir excess over the sed model for 4 sources ( eroj164023 , pdfj011423 , cudss14.13 , and smmj02399 - 0134 ) out of 6 , which can be attributed to hot dust components around agns . on the other hand , the observed mir fluxes of the other sample ( hr10 , cudss14f , and cudss14a )",
    "are reasonably explained solely by the starburst sed model . when the observed seds , except for the mir excess , are well explained by the sed model",
    ", we assume that agn dominates only at mir wavelengths , and therefore the derived parameters are still usable for the following analysis .    for 4 sample galaxies ( eroj164023 , n2 850.1 , smmj123629.13 + 621045.8 , smmj131225.7 + 424350 )",
    ", we find no reasonable sed fit ; i.e. sed models significantly under - estimate the fluxes at mir and submm wavelengths even if they give good fit to the optical ",
    "the possible reasons are 1 ) the contamination from agn ( eroj164023 ) , 2 ) the uncertainty in the optical identification ( n2 850.1 ) , and 3 ) the low signal - to - noise ratio for faint objects ( smmj131225.7 + 424350 with @xmath58 mjy ) . for smmj123629.13 + 621045.8 , it seems that none of these reasons is suitable .",
    "note that smmj123629.13 + 621045.8 is one of the reddest object ( @xmath59=6.7 ) .",
    "we may need to extend the parameter range to fit such an extremely red sed .",
    "accordingly , we exclude these 4 galaxies in the following analysis .    we present the fitting results of smmj02399 - 0136 for both l1 and l2 . since the relative contribution to mir - submm flux from each component is uncertain due to the large beam size of telescopes , we assumed that the observed mir - submm flux is dominated by either l1 or l2 .",
    "if the observed dust emission is dominated by l2 , the flux at rest - frame 2 @xmath9 m is significantly under - estimated , while the flux at rest - frame 4 @xmath9 m is properly reproduced .",
    "it is difficult to explain this discrepancy with the presence of hot dust component around the agn . on the other hand ,",
    "the sed of l1 component is reproduced well by the model .",
    "therefore , we hereafter assume that observed dust emission originates mainly from the l1 component .",
    "the present - day colours and magnitudes are calculated under the assumption that effects of star - formation after the observed epoch are not significant for the resulting present - day colours and magnitudes .",
    "this assumption is safe specifically for starbursts in the later evolutionary phase ; at @xmath60 , about 60 % of mass in the gas reservoir is already transformed into stars . in figure",
    "[ cm_uv ] , we compare the predicted present - day colours ( @xmath61 ) and magnitudes of submm galaxies with the colour - magnitude ( cm ) relation of elliptical galaxies at @xmath62 . in this figure ,",
    "a solid curve with crosses indicates the present - day colour and magnitude of a starburst at @xmath63 with @xmath64 m@xmath2 , which corresponds to the formation of the brightest elliptical galaxy",
    ". if the predicted present - day magnitude is lower than that indicated by this line at a given @xmath61 , present - day descendants of submm galaxies ( or simply end - products ) would be more massive than brightest elliptical galaxies .",
    "in the case of imf@xmath44 , more than half of old ( @xmath65 ) submm galaxies are more massive than the brightest elliptical galaxies . moreover , the resulting @xmath61 colours of all sample galaxies are bluer than the cm relation . in order to redden the end - products , a significant amount of metal rich stars or old stars ( i.e. red stars ) should be additionally supplied . since the stellar mass is already comparable to that of the brightest elliptical galaxies , such scenarios to supply red stars are not plausible .",
    "therefore , we suggest that imf@xmath44 are not appropriate for submm galaxies .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of imf@xmath46 , the majority of old submm galaxies are less massive than the brightest elliptical galaxies .",
    "we derive the mean @xmath66-band magnitude of @xmath67 @xmath68 mag for old submm galaxies .",
    "thus , the typical luminosity of the end - products of these submm galaxies is similar to those of @xmath0 elliptical galaxies which have @xmath69 mag ( marinoni et al .",
    "1999 ) .    for imf@xmath46 , not only",
    "the magnitudes , but also the present - day colours of old submm galaxies are consistent with those of elliptical galaxies ; i.e , old submm galaxies seem to follow the cm relation .",
    "this suggests that these submm galaxies can be real progenitors of elliptical galaxies .",
    "note that young ( @xmath70 ) submm galaxies are systematically bluer than old ( @xmath65 ) ones .",
    "this is because we assume that the star formation ceases at the observed epoch , irrespective of derived starburst ages , and therefore the mean metallicity of stars in young submm galaxies is smaller than that of old ones .",
    "the observations of passively evolving elliptical galaxies suggest that the origin of cm relation is the systematic difference in the mean metallicity of stars rather than that in the mean age of stars ( kodama & arimoto 1997 ) . here",
    "we can check the origin of the cm relation independently of the previous studies . in figure",
    "[ origin ] , we show the present - day age and the luminosity - weighted metallicity as a function of present - day @xmath71-band magnitude .",
    "the scatter of age is considerable at all magnitudes .",
    "such a large dispersion in age has recently been confirmed by yamada et al .",
    "( 2004 ) among elliptical galaxies in low density environments with a detailed study of h@xmath72 absorption index ( vazdekis & arimoto 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , three luminous submm galaxies ( @xmath73 ) with the age of @xmath74 gyr and @xmath75 could be real progenitors of young field ellipticals . in table 4",
    ", we give the mean characteristics of old submm galaxies at @xmath62 for each bright ( @xmath76 ) and faint sample ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "although faint sample of old submm galaxies appears to be young in the mean value , we find no difference in the mean age when we include young submm galaxies ( open circles in figure [ origin ] ) .",
    "note that the present - day age depends mainly on the redshift , not on the starburst age , while the present - day magnitude depends on the starburst age .",
    "if the end - products of young submm galaxies remains to be faint ( @xmath77 ) , there is no systematic difference in the present - day age between bright and faint sample . on the other hand , we find the systematic difference in the mean luminosity - weighted metallicity , @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the cm relation of elliptical galaxies could be caused by the systematic difference in the metallicity .",
    "however , we need more faint sample of old submm galaxies to derive firm conclusions on this issue .",
    "the analyses of the observed cm relation of elliptical galaxies suggest that the major star formation of elliptical galaxies occurred at @xmath79 ( e.g. bower et al .",
    "1992 ; kodama et al .",
    "1998 ; stanford et al .",
    "this suggests that the progenitor of elliptical galaxies would be found mostly at @xmath80 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mean redshift of our sample is 1.6 , while recent spectroscopic observations of submm galaxies suggest the median redshift of @xmath81 ( chapman et al .",
    "our sample is likely to be biased towards low redshifts , since they should be bright enough in the optical / nir photometric bands to perform the spectroscopic observations and also the sed fitting .",
    "therefore , our sample occupies a lower tail of the redshift distribution of submm galaxies . nevertheless , the present - day colours and magnitudes of the sample are consistent with the observed cm relation .",
    "this suggests that the physical mechanisms to establish the cm relation are still effective even at @xmath82 .",
    "we compare the present - day @xmath83-band magnitudes and effective radii of submm galaxies with the observed relation for elliptical galaxies , so - called the kormendy relation . since imf@xmath46 is more suitable for submm galaxies as shown above , we mainly focus on this case .",
    "the effective radii of old submm galaxies range from @xmath84 pc to a few kpc .",
    "as shown in figure [ kormendy]a , the predicted effective radii of less massive galaxies with @xmath85 mag are consistent with the observed ones , while those of massive galaxies are an order of magnitude smaller than the observed ones .",
    "this discrepancy in @xmath41 for massive galaxies can be explained if the starburst region in submm galaxies are a multiple system rather than a unit system ; i.e. several starburst regions are distributed within the potential of a whole galaxy , and these starburst regions eventually merge to form a more diffuse stellar system .",
    "note that the recent observations of submm galaxies with the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) actually show the multiple structures ( chapman et al .",
    "as we note in section 2.1.2 , the interpretation of the sed fitting remains the same if each starburst region is triggered almost simultaneously , and the intrinsic bolometric surface brightness of each starburst region is similar to each other .",
    "the other possibility which may account for this discrepancy is that the stellar system expands , owing to dynamical response to gas removal as a galactic wind .",
    "following yoshii & arimoto ( 1987 ) , we find that old submm galaxies could expand by no more than factor of @xmath863 , irrespective of the time - scale of gas removal .",
    "moreover , this effect is expected to be more significant for less massive galaxies .",
    "however , the discrepancy of effective radius between submm galaxies and elliptical galaxies is larger for more massive submm galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to explain the discrepancy of @xmath41 only by the dynamical response of a stellar system to the gas removal .",
    "the size - magnitude relation of submm galaxies seems to deviate from that of elliptical galaxies around @xmath87 mag ; i.e. the largest starburst regions in submm galaxies probably have the present - day magnitude of only @xmath87 mag .",
    "the number of starburst regions can be estimated from the present - day magnitudes if submm galaxies with the present - day @xmath88 mag are the largest starburst regions .",
    "submm galaxies with the @xmath0 present - day luminosity are likely to have at least @xmath89 starburst regions within the size of effective radius @xmath865 kpc .",
    "the clumpiness of submm galaxies may correlate with the mass of submm galaxies , since the discrepancy of the radius is larger for more massive submm galaxies .",
    "it is important to confirm the existence of the maximum scale in starburst regions , in order to understand the star formation process at high redshifts . to do this",
    ", we need high resolution imaging , e.g. with the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) .    if submm galaxies consist of multiple starburst regions , we need to correct the derived @xmath41 for the multiplicity and for the effect of merging of these starburst regions , in order to compare the derived @xmath41 with the effective radius of elliptical galaxies . to estimate the correction factor for these effects",
    ", we simply assume that starburst regions in a submm galaxy have a similar mass and sed to each other .",
    "we call this assumption as the ` equality ' condition of the starburst region .",
    "we hereafter denote the stellar mass and the effective radius of each starburst region as @xmath90 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "when a submm galaxy consists of @xmath91 starburst regions , we can write @xmath92 , since @xmath93 and @xmath94 . the gravitational energy per unit mass in a starburst region is @xmath95 . if the gravitational energy per unit mass does not change during the assembly process of multiple starburst regions , and the total stellar mass is conserved , massive submm galaxies would eventually evolve into elliptical galaxies with the effective radius of @xmath96 ; i.e. we need the correction factor @xmath97 for effective radii in figure [ kormendy]a . in figure [ kormendy]b ,",
    "we show the size - magnitude relation corrected for the multiplicity .",
    "note that the corrected size - magnitude relation has the similar slope with the observed size - magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the zero point is marginally consistent with the observation within the uncertainty , although it is systematically lower by a factor of @xmath98 .",
    "the difference in the zero point might be explained by the expansion of stellar system , as a result of the gas removal from each starburst region at the end of its activity ( e.g. yoshii & arimoto 1987 ) .",
    "the starburst activity can be characterized by the relative strength of self - gravity to feedback ( tah03 ) . in massive and compact starbursts like nearby ulirgs ,",
    "the self - gravity of starburst region becomes strong enough to suppress the feedback effect .",
    "this is because the supernova rate depends mainly on the total baryonic mass of starburst regions , while the self - gravity increases with decreasing the size of starburst region for a given mass .",
    "first , we investigate the relative strength of self - gravity to feedback in submm galaxies , which can provide an insight into the evolution of submm galaxies .",
    "tah03 estimate the strength of feedback from the kinetic energy of gas per unit mass .",
    "we follow the same prescription as that in tah03 .",
    "the total kinetic energy of gas due to feedback with the typical velocity @xmath99 can be written as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the kinetic luminosity due to feedback , and @xmath102 is the dynamical time - scale of the system . assuming that @xmath103 and @xmath104 , the kinetic energy per a unit mass can be written as @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the sfr .",
    "we use the relation @xmath107 where we find @xmath108 , @xmath109 ) and @xmath110 for imf@xmath44 and imf@xmath46 .",
    "then , we derive the escape velocity , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the total mass within @xmath41 . here , we simply assume @xmath113 and @xmath114 as in tah03 .",
    "the limiting effect of feedback against self - gravity can be estimated by the comparison of @xmath99 with @xmath115 .",
    "these velocities should be corrected when submm galaxies consist of @xmath91 starburst regions . for the equality condition of starbursts",
    ", we find the escape velocity of each starburst region @xmath116 , since @xmath117 and @xmath118 . on the other hand",
    ", we expect the velocity of gas due to feedback in each starburst @xmath119 , since the strength of feedback mainly depend on the efficiency of star formation , not on the mass scale .",
    "therefore , we find @xmath120 .",
    "if starbursts are self - regulated , we expect @xmath121 .    in figure [ velmag ]",
    ", we show @xmath122 corrected for the multiplicity , and find that most of old submm galaxies have @xmath121 .",
    "this suggests that feedback is effective , and therefore the star formation in old submm galaxies is likely to be self - regulated .    in the local universe ,",
    "tah03 suggest that uv - selected starburst galaxies ( uvsbgs ) are self - regulated , while ulirgs are dynamically unstable .",
    "the difference between uvsbgs and ulirgs can be seen as a systematic difference in the intrinsic bolometric surface brightness . in figure",
    "[ lbol ] , we show the bolometric luminosity @xmath123 and the effective radius @xmath41 of submm galaxies , along with those of nearby starburst galaxies . an arrow in figure [ lbol ] indicates the correction due to the multiplicity , assuming the equality condition of starbursts and @xmath124 .",
    "the intrinsic bolometric surface brightness of old submm galaxies are systematically lower than those of nearby ulirgs which have @xmath12510@xmath126 l@xmath2 kpc@xmath127 ; instead , it seems to follow the relation of uvsbgs .",
    "again , this may indicate that old submm galaxies are self - regulated starbursts .",
    "thus , the effect of feedback could be very important for the evolution of submm galaxies .",
    "the evolutionary trend of the feedback effect in submm galaxies can be seen in figure [ velage ] , which shows @xmath122 of submm galaxies",
    "( corrected for the multiplicity ) as a function of starburst age @xmath23 . for old submm galaxies ,",
    "@xmath122 is found to be almost constant ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus , feedback in submm galaxies is nearly balanced with the self - gravity for @xmath128 .",
    "this means that the starburst activity in submm galaxies could easily cease at any starburst age .",
    "even so , the star formation activity would not completely cease when starburst regions reside in a large scale gravitational potential well , probably due to dark matter , since the gas can fall back again to starburst regions .",
    "note that such dark matter haloes are necessary to explain the surface brightness profile at x - ray from nearby elliptical galaxies ( e.g. trinchieri , fabbiano & canizares 1986 ; matsushita et al .",
    "this also means that the mixing of gas could occur in the scale of dark matter halo ; i.e. the chemical evolution in multiple starburst regions may be related to each other .",
    "we suggest that massive submm galaxies consist of multiple self - regulated starbursts in the dark matter halo . in such systems , how the starburst activity ceases is determined not by the properties of the starburst itself , but by the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo .",
    "this means that both the resulting stellar mass and the stellar metallicity are controlled by the gravitational potential of the dark matter halo .",
    "this may be important to explain the tightness of the cm relation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "we analyse submm galaxies , including eros and host galaxies of grbs , by using the evolutionary sed model of starburst galaxies .",
    "this model allows us to investigate the intrinsic properties of submm galaxies as starbursts , since the chemical evolution is consistently taken into account .",
    "we determine the evolutionary phase of submm galaxies , and derive the stellar mass and the metallicity of stars .",
    "then , we predict the colour , magnitude and size of present - day descendants of submm galaxies , based on the results of the sed fitting .",
    "this prediction is more reliable for old submm galaxies ( @xmath129 ) , since the large fraction of gas would have been already used to form stars , and therefore the effect of star formation after the observed epoch is not significant .",
    "we derive the present - day scaling relations of submm galaxies ; i.e. the colour - magnitude and the size - magnitude relations at @xmath62 .",
    "these scaling relations can provide new clues on the evolutionary link between submm galaxies and elliptical galaxies . by comparing them with the observed scaling relations of elliptical galaxies",
    ", we have reached the following conclusions :    * the predicted present - day colours and magnitudes of submm galaxies suggest that the imf of submm galaxies is flatter than imf@xmath44 ; otherwise the present - day magnitude of submm galaxies become brighter than the brightest elliptical galaxies . * with imf@xmath46 ,",
    "the predicted colours and magnitudes of old submm galaxies are consistent with the observed cm relation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the mean present - day magnitude of submm galaxies is similar to that of @xmath0 elliptical galaxies .",
    "this implies that these submm galaxies are quite likely to evolve into present - day elliptical galaxies after the starburst event .",
    "* the derived effective radii of less massive submm galaxies ( @xmath130 mag at @xmath62 ) are consistent with the observed size - magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the small size of massive submm galaxies , compared with the size of ellipticals with similar mass , suggests that they consist of multiple starburst regions .",
    "when the multiplicity of starburst regions is taken into account , the resulting effective radii become consistent with the observation within the uncertainty .",
    "furthermore , we find that starbursts in submm galaxies are self - regulated ; i.e. feedback is nearly balanced with the self - gravity .",
    "this mechanism may be important to explain the tightness of the colour - magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies .",
