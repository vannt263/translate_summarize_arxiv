    "measuring the properties of the nucleon resonances and interpreting them in terms of the fundamental degrees of freedom of qcd is one of the goals of the hall b clas 12 detector at jefferson lab .",
    "@xcite we propose here a complementary approach to nucleon resonances using the decays of @xmath6 and @xmath7 baryons produced abundantly at lhcb or at the planned panda experiment .",
    "+ our approach is based on light cone sum rules @xcite a hybrid of classical svz - sum rules @xcite and methods from hard exclusive decays .",
    "it allows to relate the @xmath8 decay form factors to the distribution amplitudes of the @xmath5 that is roughly speaking to the momentum distribution of the quarks in different fock - states inside the @xmath5 .",
    "+ sufficient experimental data will allow to compare the extracted distribution amplitudes to constraints coming from the lattice @xcite or from electromagnetic @xmath5 form factors @xcite , see also @xcite for the general framework .",
    "this will provide an alternative approach to obtain information on the structure of low lying nucleon resonances , see also @xcite for a review of hadronic decays of heavy mesons and baryons to investigate hadronic resonances .",
    "similar calculations for the @xmath9 form factors have been done in @xcite and we will refer to @xcite for more details on the calculation .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we will give the definitions of the relevant form factors and a short introduction to the method of light cone sum rules .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the numerical analysis of the sum rules and section 4 will give some concluding remarks .",
    "the relevant formulas are given in the appendix .",
    "in addition we refer to @xcite , see also @xcite , for the basic definitions of the distribution amplitudes in order not to overload this publication .",
    "we give the definitions and derivations for the case of the @xmath10 decay .",
    "the transition to @xmath11 is simply done by replacing @xmath12 everywhere and @xmath13 in the transition current .",
    "the relevant form factors of the vector and axial - vector current are defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "we do nt consider @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the following since in semileptonic decays they will contribute with coefficients proportional to the lepton mass .",
    "+ for the @xmath18-form factors one defines @xmath19 and @xmath20 analogously to ( [ eq : formfactor ] ) by replacing @xmath7 with @xmath18 and adding a @xmath21 after the @xmath18-spinor .",
    "to get access to these form factors we use the correlation function @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the weak transition currents and @xmath24 is the interpolating current with the correct quantum numbers for the @xmath7 .",
    "we will use two different choices for @xmath25 namely @xmath26 the standard procedure of light cone sum rules is to calculate the correlation function ( [ eq : corr ] ) in two different ways . on the one hand ,",
    "one inserts a complete set of states with @xmath7 quantum numbers between the two currents and extracts the lowest lying state . on the other hand",
    ", one uses the operator product expansion ( ope ) around the light cone for space like momenta @xmath27 .",
    "this results in two different representations of the correlation function which can be equated using dispersion relations and quark - hadron duality . taking the borel - transform to eliminate possible subtraction terms from the dispersion relations and",

    "+      we will give a few details on the procedure but refer the reader to @xcite for all details of the calculations . to eliminate the @xmath18 pole from the sum rules , we explicitly keep both the @xmath7 and @xmath18 in the hadronic sum and represent higher states by a dispersion integral .",
    "the residue of the poles of the two states is given by a product of the form factors ( [ eq : formfactor ] ) and their decay constants : @xmath28 two main observations : first , using the equation of motion @xmath29 , one can decompose the correlation function into six independent , invariant functions : @xmath30 where @xmath31 labels the pseudoscalar @xmath32 and axial - vector @xmath33 interpolating current .",
    "+ second , the form factors enter in front of more than one of the lorentz - structures in ( [ eq : decompose ] ) .",

    "<S> we extract the form factors by choosing the lorentz - structures with the highest possible powers of @xmath2 .    as interpolating currents we choose an axial - vector like and a pseudoscalar like current . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the procedure of eliminating negative parity partners is not well suited for the case at hand and that the second approach with an axial - vector like interpolating current gives the most reliable results . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions are based on the models obtained in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the largest uncertainty comes from the uncertainty of the twist 4 parameters @xmath3 and we take the spread between the two models in @xcite as a measure for this . </S>",
    "<S> we get @xmath4 as predictions for the respective decay widths , where lcsr(1 ) and lcsr(2 ) refer to the two different models of the distribution amplitudes of the @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that even a rough measurement of these decays will greatly help to discriminate different models . </S>"
