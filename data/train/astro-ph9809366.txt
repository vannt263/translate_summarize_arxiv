    "recent analyses of extended rotation curves ( rcs ) of late - type spiral galaxies ( persic , salucci & stel 1996 ) have confirmed that in spirals of all luminosities a substantial dark matter ( dm ) component is detectable already in the optical region . the effect is stronger at lower luminosities :",
    "the dark - to - visible mass ratio at the optical radius @xmath0 is the radius encompassing the @xmath10 of the total integrated light .",
    "@xmath11 is the scale - length of the exponential surface brightness distribution @xmath12 . for a freeman ( 1970 )",
    "disk , @xmath0 corresponds to the de vaucouleurs 25 @xmath13-  photometric radius .",
    "] scales with luminosity @xmath14 .    for early - type spirals",
    "the status of our knowledge is different .",
    "the rcs presently available for these objects are fragmentary ( in particular in the nuclear regions ) , and only extend to @xmath15 ( see rubin et al .",
    "consequently , detailed mass decomposition have so far not been possible for these systems . in particular , it is not known whether dark halos are unambiguously present also in early - type spirals .",
    "it may be conjectured that for a given @xmath16 the dm fraction within the optical size is smaller in early than in late - type spirals : this , because in an early spiral the conspicuous stellar bulge , with @xmath17 , can supply a mass compact enough to make the rotation velocity higher than ( see rubin et al . 1985 ) , and the velocity profile different from , that of a late spiral of similar luminosity . in this case",
    ", the derivation of the halo parameters would be more uncertain for early than for late types : in fact , at small radii not two mass components ( disk + halo , like in sc - sd galaxies ) , but three mass components ( bulge + disk + halo ) will have locally similar ( solid - body like ) behaviors .",
    "so for non - extended rc data the mass solution of an sa galaxy would be degenerate even within the maximum - disk solution .",
    "in this paper we present the velocity and velocity - dispersion profiles of the stars and the ionized gas , measured along the major axis , for six early - type spirals .",
    "the six selected galaxies ( table",
    "1 ) were already known to show emission lines and their photometric properties were known . of these , 5",
    "had already been observed spectroscopically by rubin et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , who obtained the rcs of the ionized gas , and photometrically by kent ( 1988 ) .",
    "ngc  2179 was the only galaxy in our sample still lacking spectroscopical and photometrical observations .",
    "to the originally observed sample belonged the early - type spiral too .",
    "its stellar and the gaseous kinematics , found to exhibit a star vs. star counterrotation , is presented and discussed by bertola et al .",
    "three - component models ( bulge + disk + halo ) based on observed photometry and kinematics are obtained for two galaxies of the sample : ngc  2179 and ngc  2775 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of our sample galaxies were carried out at the eso 1.52-m spectroscopic telescope at la silla on february 15 - 19 , 1994 .",
    "the telescope was equipped with the boller & chivens spectrograph .",

    "grating with 1200 @xmath18 was used in the first order in combination with a @xmath19 slit .",
    "it yielded a wavelength coverage of 1990    between about 5200    and about 7190    with a reciprocal dispersion of 64.80   mm@xmath7 .",
    "the instrumental resolution was derived measuring after calibration the fwhm of 22 individual emission lines distributed all over the spectral range in the 10 central rows of a comparison spectrum .",
    "we checked that the measured fwhm s did not depend on wavelength , and we found a fwhm mean value of 2.34   .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath20    ( i.e. , @xmath21  at 5800    and @xmath22  at 6400   ) . the adopted detector was the no .  24 2048@xmath232048 ford ccd , which has a @xmath24m@xmath25 pixel size .",
    "after an on - chip binning of 3 pixels along the spatial direction , each pixel of the frame corresponds to 0.97  @xmath26 .",
    "the long - slit spectra of all the galaxies were taken along their optical major axes . at the beginning of each exposure",
    "the galaxy was centered on the slit using the guiding camera . repeated exposures ( typically of 3600 s each ) did ensure several hours of effective integration without storing up too many cosmic rays .",
    "some long - slit spectra of 8 late - g or early - k giant stars , obtained with the same instrumental setup , served as templates in measuring the stellar kinematics .",
    "their spectral classes range from g8iii to k4iii ( hoffleit & jaschek 1982 ) .",
    "the typical value of the seeing fwhm during the observing nights , measured by the la silla differential image motion monitor ( dimm ) , was @xmath27 .",
    "comparison helium - argon lamp exposures were taken before and after every object exposure .",
    "the logs of the spectroscopic observations of galaxies and template stars are reported in tables  2 and 3 , respectively .",

    "[ fig : n2775mod_a4 ] shows the stellar kinematics of ngc  2775 in the case of slightly disky ( @xmath301 ) and slightly boxy ( @xmath302 ) isophotes ( solid and dotted line , respectively ) .",
    "the disky model rotates faster and has a lower @xmath57 than the boxy model in the inner @xmath303 ( 1.9 kpc ) .",
    "the differences in @xmath83 and in @xmath57 between the two models are @xmath304 : this means that , in the observed range of values , a difference of @xmath305 in @xmath80 coefficients corresponds to a difference of @xmath306 in velocities and @xmath307 in velocity dispersions .",
    "however , these uncertainties are immaterial to our results on the mass structure of ngc  2775",
    ".    the comparison between @xmath94 and the true circular velocity inferred from the stellar kinematics is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : n2775mod_g ] .",
    "it shows that a dm halo is not strictly required to explain the rotation at large radii ( @xmath308 ) .",
    "the contribution of the dm halo to ngc  2775 circular velocity as a function of radius is plotted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : n2775mod_g ] . inside @xmath151 on the receding arm , @xmath309 and @xmath310 .",
    "this rules out the case that the gas kinematics is dominated by random motions , and leads us to speculate that we are looking at gas rotating on a non - equatorial plane .",
    "we suggest this is the signature of a past external acquisition ( possibly from the companion galaxy ngc  2777 ) of gas still not completely settled onto the disk plane .",
    "we have presented the ionized - gas and stellar kinematics , measured along the major axis , for a sample of six early - type spiral galaxies .",
    "( due to the high values of @xmath32 in their inner regions , the gas rcs can not be used as circular - velocity curves . )    for ngc  2179 and ngc  2775 , we have modeled both the stellar and the gaseous kinematics to derive the mass contribution of the luminous and dark matter to the total potential , improving on the efforts by kent ( 1988 ) from gas kinematics alone .    we have found that the innermost kinematics ( @xmath311 ) is very well and uniquely reproduced by taking into account the two luminous components . in the ( very luminous ) early - type spirals considered here , there is a large inner region in which ( essentially ) light traces the mass and the dm is a minor mass component .",
    "this is agreement with the ` weak ' maximum disk paradigm proposed by persic & salucci ( 1990 ) , but in disagreement with the claim by courteau & rix ( 1998 ) according to which in the most luminous spirals dm is a protagonist at essentially any radii .",
    "more in detail we have found that in ngc  2179 the combined stellar and gaseous rotation data ( measured out to about @xmath0 ) require the presence of a massive dark halo . in ngc  2775 , more luminous and massive than ngc  2179 , we can rule out a significant halo contribution out to @xmath312 .",
    "this result complies with the general trend of mass distribution known for later spirals ( persic et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "salucci & persic ( 1997 ) , considering a large number of galaxies of mixed morphologies ( ellipticals , late spirals , dwarfs , and lsbs ) , have suggested that the halo structural parameters and the connection between the dark and the luminous matter show a strong continuity when passing from one hubble type to another .",
    "ellipticals , considered as luminous spheroids , and spirals , considered as luminous disks , are evidently very different systems , markedly discontinuous in terms of the distribution and global properties of the luminous matter . however , in the structural parameter space , ellipticals and spirals are contiguous , the main difference being that the former are more concentrated in both the dark and luminous components , probably due to the baryons dissipational infall being deeper in ellipticals than in spirals ( e.g. , bertola et al . 1993 ) . if so , it is hardly surprising that sa galaxies , being in some sense intermediate systems consisting of a luminous spheroid embedded in a luminous disk , fit in the regularity pattern of the dark - to - visible mass connection shared by ellipticals and spirals . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dm ] we plot our derived dark - to - visible mass ratios at the farthest measured radii for ngc  2179 and ngc  2775 ( filled circles ) onto the distribution , derived by salucci & persic ( 1997 ) for galaxies with the same visible mass .",
    "the agreement is good .",
    "even if the present result on early - type spirals is preliminary and without pretending to draw general conclusions from one particular case , it nevertheless seems to agree with the idea that , for galaxies of all morphological types , the dark - to - luminous mass ratio at any given radius depends only on the ( luminous ) mass of the galaxy .",
