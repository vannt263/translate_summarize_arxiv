    "one of the simplest ways to model the proton is as three very light quarks confined in a spherical well .",
    "choosing the radius of the well to be @xmath0 fm leads to moderately good agreement with experiment for its electromagnetic properties , such as the charge radius , magnetic moment , and static electric and magnetic polarizabilities .",
    "this model , a simplified version of the mit bag model @xcite , will be referred to in the following as the static - well model .",
    "it allows an alternative approach to the calculation of the electromagnetic properties of the proton , generally treated with methods quite different in character , that uses the methods of conventional bound - state qed .",
    "the latter theory is characterized by wave functions that satisfy the dirac equation in an external field along with electron propagators defined in terms of the same field .",
    "when the external field is that of a point coulomb source , a modification of the interaction representation introduced by furry @xcite allows a systematic feynman diagram treatment of radiative corrections .",
    "this approach can also be applied to many - electron systems , and a feynman diagram treatment of electron - electron interactions is also possible . as will be explained below , the present paper is patterned on a calculation of these interactions in heliumlike ions involving two - photon exchange @xcite .",
    "the approach we will use in this paper was applied some time ago @xcite to the computation of the electromagnetic self energy of the proton and neutron . in that work , both the effect of exchange of a photon between quarks along with the electromagnetic self energy of the quarks",
    "were evaluated and found to sum to @xmath1 mev for the proton and @xmath2 mev for the neutron for the case of nearly zero - mass quarks .",
    "the fact that the proton is lighter than the neutron remains explained by the fact that the down quark is heavier than the up quark , but it is of note that the electromagnetic correction to the mass splitting , @xmath3 mev , is the same order - of - magnitude as the neutron - proton mass difference , @xmath0 mev .",
    "the proton can be studied with electron - scattering experiments , which have a long history of providing information about its properties , in particular the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius , @xmath4 .",
    "the proton size has recently received considerable attention because of unexpected results for the @xmath5 transition energy of muonic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the issue of determining @xmath4 from scattering data can be problematic , as extrapolating the slope of the dirac form factor to @xmath6 involves a number of assumptions @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is to determine the proton size by doing precise measurements of atomic transitions that are sensitive to the effect of the size .",
    "the 2010 codata result @xcite in fact uses this procedure with hydrogen and deuterium , where the experiment and theory are so accurate that the proton size can be inferred with an accuracy comparable to that available from scattering experiments as of 2010 .    because of its smaller size",
    ", muonic hydrogen has long been recognized as a system whose spectrum could be used to determine a much more accurate rms radius of the proton than that obtained from hydrogen and deuterium , but the associated experimental obstacles have only recently been overcome .",
    "while indeed much more accurate , the result of ref .",
    "@xcite for the proton size , @xmath7 is significantly smaller than the codata result , @xmath8 this discrepancy is referred to as the muonic hydrogen puzzle",
    ".    one possible explanation of the puzzle involves the electromagnetic structure of the proton , and the largest theoretical uncertainty comes from an effect called proton polarizability .",
    "this is generally evaluated by relating the energy shift to forward virtual photon - proton scattering .",
    "the amplitude describing this scattering , @xmath9 , can then be related to proton form factors through dispersion relations .",
    "a recent paper that covers all contributions to muonic hydrogen with particular attention to proton polarizability is ref .",
    "@xcite ; in the conclusion , we compare our results to results quoted in that paper .",
    "a number of issues involving convergence of the dispersion theory integrals and the need for experimental data complicate that approach .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to provide an alternative analysis patterned after bound - state field theory calculations in atomic physics .",
    "this will be done by using the static - well model of the proton together with standard bound - state qed . as we will show",
    ", there is a natural way of setting up a consistent qed calculation for hydrogen and muonic hydrogen , with the proton treated as a bound state of three quarks interacting with an electron or a muon , that requires no scattering information for its predictions ; rather it depends only on the radius of the well .",
    "regarding the proton as three relativistic particles confined to a small volume is closely analogous to treating three electrons in highly - charged ions , where the electrons for large nuclear charge @xmath10 are quite relativistic and the ion has a size of @xmath11 bohr radius .",
    "this problem has recently been addressed with techniques similar to those used for heliumlike ions mentioned above @xcite , and have been shown to provide an accurate description of these ions @xcite , the spectra of which have been measured with high accuracy @xcite .    in these calculations",
    "almost all of the important physics is described by feynman diagrams with one or two photons .",
    "the same turns out to hold for the present calculation , though in this paper , while we will show all relevant diagrams , we concentrate our attention on two effects dependent on proton structure , the polarizability of the proton and the screening of the proton electromagnetic self energy .",
    "our model of the proton is extremely simple , but there are three reasons we have chosen it .",
    "the first is that proton structure effects are generally very small , with even the largest , the effect of its finite size , accounting for about 2 percent of the transition energy in muonic hydrogen .",
    "thus even a crude determination of a proton structure effect will have a small relative theoretical error .",
    "the second is that while the proton polarizability correction has been evaluated with other methods , a contribution we term the proton lamb shift has not , and the results presented here may stimulate more sophisticated calculations .",
    "the final reason is that mentioned above , to explore a method of calculating the effect of proton structure on atomic energy levels that does not require the use of dispersion theory .",
    "we will in the following consider the effect of proton structure on both electronic and muonic hydrogen .",
    "because our formalism does not include recoil , we will present results in terms of the electron mass @xmath12 and the muon mass @xmath13 even though reduced - mass effects on the latter are about 10 percent . when we give a general formula",
    ", we refer to a lepton with mass @xmath14 .",
    "the state of the lepton , in practice either @xmath15 or @xmath16 , will be denoted @xmath17 , and the index @xmath18 will be used for sums over intermediate leptonic states : for the corresponding case of quarks , we use @xmath19 to denote a ground - state quark and reserve @xmath20 for sums over intermediate quark states .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in section ii with a quantum mechanical ( qm ) treatment of the shift in energy levels arising from the perturbation of replacing the potential of a point proton coulomb field with that of a general distribution of charge @xmath21 .",
    "this perturbation theory is evaluated through second order . in section iii",
    "we turn to a quantum - field - theoretic approach to the problem in the context of the static - well model .",
    "we do this by modifying the standard furry representation @xcite through forcing the lowest - order hamiltonian to be same as that used in that representation , but having the quarks in the proton provide the coulomb field instead of assuming a point source .",
    "this requires the introduction of a new term in the interaction hamiltonian we call the counter term , the effects of which however are quite simple to evaluate .",
    "we also define the static - well model and briefly review the calculation of the proton electromagnetic self energy . in section",
    "iv we use bound - state field theory to treat one photon exchange , and show that the results agree with the first order qm energy .",
    "we note here that in this paper we use the coulomb gauge and treat only coulomb photons for all exchanged photons . for the qm approach this corresponds to ignoring magnetic effects , and in field theory to leaving out transverse - photon exchange . in section v we then turn to two - photon exchange diagrams , which we break into two classes , one in which only one photon attaches to the lepton , with the other being emitted and reabsorbed in the proton , and a second in which each photon is exchanged between the lepton and a quark . in section",
    "va we treat the first class , which has no qm analog , and present a calculation of the contribution , which we call the proton lamb shift . in section",
    "vb we treat the second class , but again make a breakup of the diagrams into firstly a part in which the proton is left unchanged , and secondly a part where it is excited .",
    "( in our model this means that in the spectral representation of the quark propagator it is either saturated with the @xmath22 state , or else that state is excluded ) .",
    "the first part will be shown to correspond exactly to the second - order qm energy .",
    "the second part , the proton polarizability , is then evaluated .",
    "the related calculation of the proton s static electric polarizability is carried out in section vi , and it is shown that in the @xmath23 angular momentum channel a complete cancellation between positive- and negative - energy state terms occurs , leaving only contributions from the @xmath24 intermediate states . in the conclusion",
    "we compare our results to the results of other calculations and describe directions for future progress .",
    "we consider a central potential for hydrogen or muonic hydrogen coming from a finite charge distribution @xmath25 , normalized to unity .",
    "the corresponding static potential is @xmath26 while we have @xmath27 , the following discussion can also be applied to the case @xmath28 .",
    "we start with a point - coulomb binding field , so this distribution leads to the perturbation @xmath29    the first - order correction , @xmath30 is valid for either a relativistic or nonrelativistic calculation .",

    "the first term in the square brackets is the third zemach moment , which we denote @xmath46 .",
    "an interesting feature about this term is that it too is cancelled by a term that arises when the nucleus is allowed to undergo low - energy excitations ( proton polarizability ) , though we will not use this fact directly , and instead just evaluate the entire effect .",
    "we turn now to a field - theoretic approach based on the static - well model , and begin by introducing a formalism for bound - state field theory .",
    "while the formalism we use here is to our knowledge novel , it is a simple extension of the furry representation @xcite , which we now briefly review .",
    "we will use this representation both for leptons and quarks , and begin by describing how it is used for the former .",

    "@xmath55 of a lepton with photons keeps the same form , the lowest order spectrum now consists of hydrogenic bound and scattering states , and the lepton green function obeys the relation @xmath56 which has the spectral representation @xmath57 in the present case we treat proton structure using the static - well model to specify the wave functions and green functions of the constituent quarks .",
    "however , the influence of the proton on a lepton in a bound state can not be treated perturbatively , so we need to build the binding of the lepton into the formalism nonperturbatively .",
    "we do this by modifying the breakup of the hamiltonian given above to @xmath58 .",
    "if we choose @xmath59 then this breakup is @xmath60 . in the following",
    "we refer to @xmath61 as the counter term , though of course it is to be distinguished from the electron mass counter term .",
    "we stress that we do _ not _ assume that a classical coulomb field is present .",
    "however , because we have added a new term to the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath54 is unchanged from the usual furry representation , and the same wave functions and green functions used in feynman diagram calculations in that representation can be used , although extra feynman diagrams involving @xmath61 need to be included .",
    "the use of the furry representation must be extended to quarks in order to account for the proton s coulomb field . in this case @xmath52 and @xmath55 are almost identical to the free case , but in @xmath52 we assume the presence of a static well that confines the quarks , the details of which are given below , so that the up and down quark fields are expanded in terms of solutions to the dirac equation in this well .",
    "the proton then consists of the usual two up quarks and one down quark , and the sum of their charges leads to the coulomb field felt by the lepton .",
    "since the lowest - order problem describes the basic physics of the atom , there has to be cancellation between diagrams in which a coulomb photon is exchanged between the lepton and the quarks in the proton and diagrams with one counter term . in second order",
    "another cancellation between two - photon exchange diagrams and diagrams involving one and two counter terms must take place , and so on .",
    "because the proton is now modeled as a finite object , the cancellation will not be complete , and we will identify the parts remaining after the near cancellation as the subject of this paper , proton structure effects .",
    "it is of course vital for this procedure to make sense that the cancellation not only takes place , but that the perturbation expansion converges .",
    "we will present results for the first and second terms in the expansion below . in determining the order of the expansion",
    "we note that the counter term @xmath61 is of the same order as two @xmath55 s .",
    "the static - well model has well - known solutions which we show partly to establish notation .",
    "we represent the solution to the free dirac equation in a spherically symmetric well , centered at the same origin as used in furry representation , by @xmath62 here @xmath63 is a spherical spinor and the radial wavefunctions obey the equations @xmath64f_2(r ) & = & 0 \\\\ \\left({\\partial \\over \\partial r }   + { 1 - \\kappa \\over r } \\right)f_2(r )   + \\left[e - m(r)\\right]f_1(r ) & = & 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    confinement is enforced by choosing @xmath65 to be constant inside the well and tending to infinity for @xmath66 , which leads to the mit bag model boundary conditions @xcite .",

    "when this wave function is used for the up and down quarks the second and third moments , which can be calculated analytically , are @xmath75 and @xmath76 while an analytic form can be derived for the third zemach moment , it is lengthy and involves the sine integral , so we give only its numerical value , @xmath77    the wave functions of the up and down quarks are identical in this zero mass case , and we denote them as @xmath78 .",
    "this approximation leads to the important simplification that the charge density of the proton , even though it consists of three quarks , can be written in terms of @xmath78 , @xmath79 we will see that in our calculations of one- and two - coulomb photon exchange this density will enter in exactly the same way as it does in sec .",
    "ii in parts of the calculation , thereby reproducing the results of that section with the static - well model charge density .",
    "extra terms arising from the field theory approach will be identified with polarizability effects .",

    "this is justified by the behavior of the lowest - order proton electromagnetic self energy , where the size of the exchange term and the quark self energy are of the same magnitude .",

    "however , we are not aware of any direct calculation of this term with zero - mass quarks , and will discuss how such a calculation could be carried out in the conclusions section .    before turning to two - photon effects",
    ", we give more details about the use of finite basis sets .",
    "as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , atomic finite basis set calculations are carried out in a well much larger than the atom , but with the same boundary conditions as used for the quarks .",
    "we continue to use an atomic basis set appropriate for hydrogen , but add a second basis set for the quarks , which is obtained by simple modifications of the atomic code , involving changing the fermion mass to zero , eliminating the potential , and changing from atomic units to mev - fm units .",
    "atomic grids are created on an exponential grid of the form @xmath157 $ ] .",
    "we use the same grid for both quark and lepton wavefunctions .",
    "this is done by choosing parameters such that if , for example , a 1000 point grid were used for the atom , the two hundredth point would be at @xmath158 fm , so that the quark wave function would be put on a 200 point grid that matched the atomic grid , though of course the quark wave function vanishes for @xmath159 .",

    "the effect of the negative - energy states is generally very small , entering at the order of the lamb shift .",
    "however , for quarks they play a more important role .",
    "we now turn our attention to diagrams shown in fig .  5 .",
    "in this section we will show that they in part reproduce the second order perturbation theory expression for @xmath161 , eq .",
    "( [ secondorderpt ] ) in section ii , but have in addition extra terms we identify as proton polarizability . to compare with individual diagrams , it is useful to employ eq .",
    "( [ vparts ] ) to represent @xmath162 in terms of @xmath163 , which yields four terms for eq .",
    "( [ secondorderpt ] ) : @xmath164 @xmath165 @xmath166 and @xmath167    the simplest diagram , fig .",

    "the diagrams of fig . 5b and its complex conjugate give @xmath169 and @xmath170 if we identify @xmath171 as in the treatment of one - photon exchange .",
    "this leaves only @xmath172 to be accounted for .",
    "in general one contribution to it comes from fig .",
    "5c , given by @xmath173 where the definition of @xmath138 is the same as in sec .",
    "[ sec : spse ] .",
    "the various contributions to this term happen to sum to zero for the proton in our model , but we note they would not were we considering the neutron , or if we were taking the up and down quark wave functions to be different .    the final two diagrams , 5d and 5e , are referred to as the ladder ( l ) and crossed ladder ( xl ) respectively .",
    "the closed loop in these diagrams is associated with an integration over a virtual energy . because in this paper we consider only two - coulomb photon exchange , the analysis of the loop integral is considerably simpler than the case where the photon propagators have energy dependence .",
    "that complication was encountered in the full feynman gauge analysis of ladder and crossed ladder diagrams in excited states of heliumlike ions @xcite , upon which the present calculation is patterned .",
    "issues involved in carrying out the full calculation will be discussed in the conclusion . in this simpler case",
    "we can carry out the integral over the timelike component of the loop momentum with cauchy s theorem , which requires identifying the poles coming from the propagators .",
    "we partition the lepton and quark propagators into positive and negative energy parts , which could lead to four contributions for each diagram , but the position of the poles is such that only two contributions fail to vanish . the surviving terms are @xmath174 and @xmath175 for the ladder diagram , and @xmath176 and @xmath177 for the crossed ladder .",
    "the relative minus sign between the two ladder and the two crossed ladder terms comes from closing the contour in different ways , and we note that the coulomb propagators are different for the ladder and crossed ladder diagrams . in the following",
    "we will give formulas only for @xmath178 and @xmath179 as the other terms differ from these only by an overall minus sign and a reversed role of positive and negative energy states .",
    "at this point we divide the sum over intermediate quark states into a part with @xmath180 , which leaves the proton unchanged and corresponds to elastic scattering , and the remaining part , corresponding to inelastic scattering , which gives the polarizability contribution .",
    "we now show that the elastic term contains @xmath172 . as @xmath181 is positive energy , only @xmath178 and @xmath179 contribute . because the quark states are now all @xmath150-states , the angular - momentum dependence is particularly simple . the coulomb propagators can be simplified with the replacements @xmath182 with @xmath183 , @xmath184 .",
    "( for later use we define @xmath185 , @xmath186 . )",
    "integration over angles then yields @xmath187 with @xmath18 being forced to be an @xmath150 state .",
    "we have introduced the shorthand @xmath188    because @xmath189 , this reproduces the part of @xmath172 in which the electron propagator involves sums over positive energy states . in order to include the part with negative energy states the crossed ladder must be considered . the minus sign mentioned above is needed for the energy denominators to match , and the fact that @xmath190 is symmetric under interchange of @xmath191 and @xmath192 is also needed .",
    "thus part of the ladder and crossed ladder diagrams together with the other diagrams of fig",
    ".  5 simply reproduce second - order perturbation theory with a particular form for the charge distribution of the proton .",
    "we evaluated these terms numerically as a test of the coding , since the qm treatment yields a nonrelativistic ( nr ) limit for comparison .",
    "the result for muonic hydrogen is @xmath193 which is within @xmath194 of the nr formula .",
    "we recall that formula has a mixture of the zemach term and a @xmath195 term , where the latter cancels part of the one - loop result .",
    "we now turn to the evaluation of the remaining parts of the ladder and crossed ladder .",
    "the quark propagator is treated in the same manner as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : spse ] .",
    "the feature of the basis set mentioned in that section , whereby it automatically breaks into a positive and a negative energy part , makes separation of the various diagrams a simple matter .",
    "we begin with the case where @xmath196 , but where we do not allow the intermediate quark to be in the ground state .",
    "the result for the ladder is @xmath197 mev , and is almost completely cancelled by the crossed ladder , which contributes @xmath198 mev , making this channel completely negligible .    in order to treat higher partial waves",
    "we must now specify the spin state of the atom .",
    "polarizability is important only for the @xmath81 state , which of course can be a triplet or singlet state once the spin of the proton is considered . for one - coulomb - photon exchange",
    "these states have the same energy , as hyperfine splitting comes from transverse photon exchange , which is not treated here . however , with two - photon exchange , even when both are coulomb photons , the triplet and singlet energies differ except for the @xmath199 partial wave discussed above .",
    "we therefore present in the following formulas for the energy levels of the @xmath81 singlet and triplet .    while each coulomb propagator has its own partial wave expansion , leading in general to a double sum over @xmath200 and @xmath201 , the fact that the quarks are all in @xmath150-states leads to the simplification that these values are equal , @xmath202 .",
    "another simplification is that for a given @xmath203 , only @xmath204 and @xmath145 values associated with that value give a non - vanishing contribution .",
    "we define angular factors @xmath205 for the ladder and @xmath206 for the crossed ladder diagrams , which are rational fractions resulting from the integrations over angles and sums over magnetic quantum numbers , tabulated in table ii for @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "both the triplet and singlet state results are given , though in this paper we are only interested in fine structure .",
    "@xmath207 corresponds to the dominant dipole transition . in terms of these coefficients ,",
    "the formula for the ladder is @xmath209 and for the crossed ladder is @xmath210 where @xmath211 and @xmath212 .       ' '' ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''       these can be evaluated with the techniques described above with only simple changes , as the spline basis set contains all values of @xmath213 needed and the radial integrals over @xmath214 are evaluated with techniques valid for arbitrary @xmath203 .",
    "the main numerical problem was ensuring that the typical rapid convergence of splines in atomic physics carried over to this problem .",
    "the calculation shows that the effect of the @xmath208 channel is very small , with almost the entire effect of polarizability coming from the @xmath207 dipole channel , which shifts the @xmath81 energy down by 0.026 mev .",
    "this leads to our main polarizability result for the splitting , @xmath215 consistent with the results from dispersion relation analyses , as will be discussed in the conclusions .",
    "one of the basic electromagnetic properties of the proton is its static polarizability , which has an electric and a magnetic component .",
    "we concentrate on the static electric polarizability , which is given by the particle data group as @xmath216 while this value is extracted from compton scattering data together with dispersion theory arguments @xcite , in the static - well model the lowest - order expression comes from the diagram of fig .  6 , where the line with a cross indicates a constant electric field with magnitude @xmath217 .",
    "the energy shift is related to the static electric polarizability through @xmath218 we note two similar calculations using the closely related mit bag model @xcite , @xcite have been presented , but detailed comparison with their results is not possible .",

    "the basic equation for the energy shift of a proton in the presence of a constant electric field described by the potential @xmath220 is @xmath221 which reduces to @xmath222 for this case the orientation of the quark spin does not matter , so the expression simplifies to @xmath223 where we have now isolated the factor @xmath224 to give the formula in terms of @xmath225 .",
    "we emphasize at this point that this is a field theoretic derivation , and that the sum over @xmath20 is complete , including negative - energy states .    introducing the notation",

    "the most striking result found was that the @xmath23 channel vanishes .",
    "if one sums over only positive energy states one obtains a nonzero result , but inclusion of the negative energy states leads to an exact cancellation . this situation does not occur for the @xmath24 channel , which in our model is solely responsible for the proton static polarizability .",

    "( [ quarkprop ] ) . after rewriting eq .",
    "( [ alphapdef ] ) as @xmath228 we use the fact that the quark green function satisfies the differential equation @xmath229 with appropriate boundary conditions . without those conditions this is the same equation that a free fermion green function satisfies , and a simple modification of the well - known partial - wave expansion of the latter propagator can be made to solve for the quark propagator .",

    "( [ eq : spol ] ) includes the factor @xmath235 which vanishes .",
    "an analogous factor on the left - hand - side when @xmath236 also vanishes .",
    "however , for @xmath24 there is no such cancellation , and using @xmath237 we find the numerical result @xmath238    the spectral decomposition discussed previously gives the same result , and one can see the sum is dominated by the first @xmath239 state , with higher-@xmath20 positive - energy and negative - energy states entering at under one tenth of a percent . this result is a factor of two larger than the experimental value in eq .",
    "( [ eq : epol ] ) . however , we note that the relation of the pdg result quoted to static polarizability determined from energy shifts involves some subtleties , discussed in @xcite and more recently in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present an approach to calculating the effect of the electromagnetic structure of the proton on energy levels of muonic hydrogen that uses a simple bound - state model for the proton , with only one free parameter , the radius of the well , which we have chosen to be @xmath74 fm .",
    "once the formalism is set up , standard techniques of quantum field theory can be used to evaluate proton structure effects using this parameter , in contrast to the standard approach , which involves the analysis of forward photon proton scattering .",
    "we do not claim our approach is better , only that it introduces a different way of looking at the problem .",
    "we have considered only coulomb photons in this paper .",
    "this is because our primary concern was in setting up the basic formalism , and testing it in the relatively tractable case of coulomb photon exchange .",
    "to continue , while one could stay in the coulomb gauge and introduce transverse photons , it is simpler to simply change to the feynman gauge .",
    "because the quarks all have the same energy , much of the work here is effectively already in the feynman gauge , with @xmath240 continuing the calculation to this more complete state will allow the treatment of the interesting case of hyperfine splitting .",
    "the difficulties of proton structure are well known to be exacerbated in this case , with even ground - state hydrogen hfs uncertain at the sixth digit .",
    "our approach should allow a direct calculation of what is often referred to as dynamic proton polarizability , as well as allowing a systematic treatment of other spin dependent effects that sometimes are difficult to disentangle .",
    "these calculations are complicated by the fact that the loop energy integral can no longer be evaluated with cauchy s theorem .",
    "instead one must carry out a wick rotation to the imaginary axis and carry out the integral numerically .",
    "this rotation requires care because of the presence of poles and cuts in the complex plane , which leads to a number of extra terms .",
    "we have shown that in our method a term , while extremely small , that can be thought of as the lamb shift of the proton arises .",
    "the smallness of the effect had very much to do with the fact that all three quarks are taken to be in the @xmath22 state , which limits the @xmath213 values allowed for the propagator .",
    "it is an interesting open question as to how this effect would change if corrections to the proton wave function involving non-@xmath150 states were present , as they presumably are because of gluon exchange , but that is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we have shown that the one - photon diagrams together with the part of the two - photon diagrams where the proton is unchanged give the result @xmath241~\\mbox{mev}.\\ ] ] this was calculated without the large recoil corrections present in muonic hydrogen : multiplying the appropriate factors of @xmath242 and @xmath243 into the first and second terms , our result becomes @xmath244~\\mbox{mev}.\\ ] ]    the polarizability of the proton was calculated in a novel fashion .",
    "the basic result of this paper is that despite the difference in approach , a similarly small result is found .",
    "specifically , again restoring recoil corrections by multiplying our result by @xmath243 , we have found the proton polarizability correction @xmath245 while inclusion of transverse photons may lead to quantitative changes , we consider it unlikely that a qualitative change will result .",
    "we now compare our results with ref .",
    "@xcite , where the formula @xmath246 is given in their eq .",
    "( 32 ) , with the breakdown of @xmath247 mev given in table i along with results from other calculations that differ by under 2 @xmath248ev .",
    "the quadratic term compares well when a term @xmath249 arising from radiative corrections to finite size , not treated here , is removed .",
    "the breakup of @xmath250 involves three terms , a subtraction term of @xmath251 mev , an elastic term of @xmath252 mev , and an inelastic term of @xmath253 mev .",
    "the first has no counterpart in our calculation , but if we identify the elastic term with our zemach contribution of @xmath254mev and the inelastic with our polarization of @xmath255 mev we see fairly good agreement .",
    "perhaps the most interesting calculation left undone in this framework is vacuum polarization .",
    "this of course dominates the muonic hydrogen @xmath5 splitting when an electron is in the vacuum polarization loop , but in our framework we could also put in the zero - mass quarks confined in the well into the loop . for an isolated proton , symmetry arguments",
    "@xcite show that vacuum polarization vanishes , but once in an atom the arguments no longer hold , and a finite effect should be present . the standard approach is to introduce pion loops , in which case the previously mentioned very small `` hadronic vacuum polarization '' value of 0.011 mev results , but this approach is quite different .",
    "such calculations are , however , particularly challenging because of the high degree of divergence present , which always presents difficulties for bound - state methods .",
    "we are investigating whether techniques that have proved useful in studying vacuum polarization effects in atoms @xcite , where careful grouping of angular momentum contributions allows an accurate treatment of highly - divergent terms , can be extended to this novel case .",
