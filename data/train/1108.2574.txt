    "finite - size scaling and corrections for critical systems have attracted much attention in recent decades . although many theoretical results are now known about the critical exponents and universal relations among the leading critical amplitudes , not much information is available on ratios among the amplitudes in finite - size correction terms @xcite .",

    "the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are known @xcite , to be related to the conformal anomaly number ( @xmath21 ) , the conformal weight of the ground state @xmath22 , and the scaling dimension of the @xmath23-th scaling field ( @xmath24 ) of the theory @xmath25 for strip geometry . here",

    "for ising universality class there are five different boundary universality classes : periodic , antiperiodic , free , fixed and mixed ( mixture of the last two ) .",
