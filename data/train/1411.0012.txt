    "the superconductivity ( ss ) with very short coherence length and the phase separation ( ps ) phenomenon involving ss states are very current topics ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that metastable and unstable states have been found in many physical systems experimentally and theoretically .    in our work",
    "we will study a model which directly pertains to that problem .",

    "model ( [ row : ham1 ] ) exhibits ( in the absence of the field conjugated with the superconducting ( ss ) order parameter @xmath17 ) a symmetry between ( @xmath18-pairing ) and ( @xmath19-pairing , @xmath19s , , @xmath20 being half of the smallest reciprocal lattice vector ) cases .",
    "thus , we restrict ourselves to the case only . in the presence of finite single electron hopping the symmetry is broken in the general case @xcite .    model ( [ row : ham1 ] ) has been intensively analysed for @xcite as well as for @xcite ( in particular , in the context of the phase separation @xcite ) . in the analysis",
    "we have adopted a variational approach ( va ) , which treats the on - site interaction term ( @xmath0 ) exactly and the intersite interaction ( @xmath1 ) within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
