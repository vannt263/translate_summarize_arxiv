    "there are a number of phenomenological facts known for liquids which can be formulated in simple terms but their proof or explanation from the first principles of statistical theory of liquid state is absent .",
    "the remarkable linearities of the binodal diameter @xcite and the unit compressibility curve @xmath3 ( zeno - line ) @xcite in density - temperature plane are probably of the oldest known in liquid state physics .",
    "the law of rectilinear diameter ( lrd ) of the binodal is as following : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the number densities of the liquid and vapor phases correspondingly , @xmath6 are the critical density and temperature . the lrd is observed for simple molecular fluids in wide temperature region of liquid - vapor coexistence .",
    "it is also confirmed by the computer simulations ( see e.g. @xcite ) and commonly serves as a tool to estimate the critical density @xcite .",
    "another remarkable phenomenological linearity established early before for the van der waals equation of state by batschinsky @xcite and confirmed for many fluids @xcite .",
    "the fact is that the states with @xmath7 form the straight line on @xmath8 plane : @xmath9 this line is called the zeno - line @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 are determined as follows : @xmath12 as the available data show the linear law holds for real fluids and model systems with pair interactions of the lennard - jones ( lj ) type with good accuracy .",
    "moreover , it holds even for associative liquids like ammonia and water @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty in the explanation of these linearities is the construction of adequate equation of state ( eos ) for real substances . in rigorous sense",
    "it is unsolvable problem since the eos is complicated functional of the interparticle interactions .",
    "nevertheless , due to principle of corresponding states ( pcs ) it is possible to introduce the classes of the thermodynamic similarity @xcite . in its general statement",
    "the pcs is rather trivial since it can be proven explicitly only if the interaction potentials are of the same functional form modulo simple scaling of the parameters @xcite . for real systems",
    "the refinement of the nave form of the pcs is needed and additional invariants are introduced @xcite . the critical compressibility factor ( ccf )",
    "@xmath13 is the simplest scaling invariant widely used in the formulation of the pcs . for the vdw eos @xmath14 .",
    "simple fluids , e.g. nobel gases @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , have @xmath18 . for the ccf",
    "the empirical timmerman s relation is known : @xmath19 it holds quite good for many substances @xcite . to the best of our knowledge",
    "no theoretical explanations for this relation exist up to now .    in this paper",
    "the relation between the critical compressibility factors of the lj - fluid and the lattice gas is obtained .",
    "we use the global isomorphism approach proposed in @xcite and the results of @xcite .",
    "we also obtain the value of @xmath2 for the lj - fluid in 2d and 3d cases . the result for @xmath2 derived below",
    "provides the alternative to the pure _ empirical _ timmermans relation .",
    "it grounds on the equality of thermodynamic potentials of lj - fluid and lattice gas @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly outline the global isomorphism approach between the lj - fluid and the lattice gas ( ising model ) .",
    "section iii is devoted to the derivation of the relation between critical compressibility factors @xmath2 of lj - fluid and lattice gas . on this basis",
    "we get the estimates for the critical pressures of lj - fluid in two and three dimensions . in section",
    "iv we describe simple way of how to include the pitzer s acentric factor into consideration .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in conclusion .",
    "the extension of the pcs , which unifies the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the liquid metals and molecular fluids , was put forward in series of works of apfelbaum and vorobev @xcite .",
    "the authors introduced the concept of the triangle of liquid - gas states .",
    "as was shown in @xcite the results of @xcite can be cast into the compact form of projective mapping between the density - temperature phase diagrams of the fluid and the lattice gas : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the density and the temperature of the lattice gas ( lg ) , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are some parameters which will be defined below ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the coordinates of the cp of the lattice gas are normalized so that @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the derivation of uses simple geometrical arguments and substantially relies on the lrd and zeno - linearity@xcite .",
    "maps the states within the liquid - gas triangle on the @xmath28-states of the lattice gas ( ising model ) .",
    "this brings the concept of the global isomorphism between the systems once the lrd and the zeno - linearity hold @xcite .",
    "recently , several generalizations of transformation have been proposed @xcite .",
    "we will not use these extensions here and prefer to use eq .   as the ",
    "minimal  and the simplest form of the isomorphism transformation compatible with the lrd and the zeno - linearity based on the results of previous works @xcite .    in global isomorphism",
    "approach the notion of zeno - element is used instead of the zeno - line @xcite .",
    "the zeno - element is the line of the same form as eq .   with the parameters @xmath29 determined via the boyle point in van der waals ( vdw ) approximation : @xmath30 and @xmath31 here @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the attractive part of the full potential @xmath34",
    ", @xmath35 is the effective diameter of the particle so that @xmath36 .",
    "note that we do not use the van der waals eos , rather we use the van der waals approximation for the boyle temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore only attractive part of the interaction potential is used with the hard sphere radius cut - off . from the physical point of view it correlates with the fact that the lattice gas interaction includes the attraction only .",
    "the repulsive part is introduced in the model only via the restriction rule  one site - one particle  . in @xcite",
    "this approach was applied for two and three dimensional lj fluid .",
    "the parameters @xmath37 of the mapping show good agreement with theoretical values , under fitting the available data .",
    "the parameter @xmath38 of the transformation can be related with the exponent of the attractive part of the potential @xmath39 : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the dimension @xcite .",
    "also eq .",
    "gives pretty good estimates for the locus of the cp of the lennard - jones fluids @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite have shown that the parameters @xmath42 can be related with the pitzer s acentric factor @xmath43 which accounts for the molecular shape .",
    "this puts the question of taking into account the hard core effects of the repulsive part of the interaction in the parameter @xmath38 of the transformation .",
    "this opportunity needs further studies and will be discussed briefly in section iv .",
    "here we consider the critical compressibility factor @xmath2 , which is the core parameter for the formulation of the pcs , and get the analog of the timmermans relation in the global isomorphism context . to do this we derive the relation between thermodynamic potentials of the fluid @xmath44 and lattice gas @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the pressure of the lattice gas .",
    "let us define the number of lattice sites @xmath47 with the volume of the fluid by @xmath48 .",
    "we start with the basic thermodynamic relations : @xmath49 and from eq .",
    "we get : @xmath50 as the global isomorphism relates the thermodynamic states of corresponding systems then the conjugated fields @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be related @xmath53 due to simple relation : @xmath54 note , that here is important that the temperature variable of the fluid @xmath55 depends only on the temperature of the lattice gas @xmath22 . comparing eq .   with eq .",
    "we get the relation : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the value of the chemical potential on the saturation curve below the critical point @xmath58 .",
    "the density is nothing but the derivative of the thermodynamic potential on the conjugated field .",
    "this fact together with the linear character of on densities @xmath59 and @xmath21 leads to the relation between pressures of fluid @xmath60 and of the lg @xmath46 : @xmath61 or in terms of the potentials : @xmath62 it is easy to check that eq .  follows from eq .",
    "and eq .  .    with this eq",
    ".   allows to derive the relation between the critical compressibility factors @xmath2 of a fluid and the corresponding lattice model . indeed , from eq .   and",
    "eq .   we get : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the critical temperature of the ising model and @xmath65 is the ccf of the lg . in accordance with @xcite",
    "it is related with the partition function per spin @xmath66 of the ising model @xmath67 .",
    "the value @xmath68 can be obtained for lattice models using ( high)low - temperature expansions @xcite .",
    "e.g. in 3d case @xmath69 @xcite and @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "note that eq .   and",
    "eq .   differ essentially .",
    "in contrast to the timmermans relation its global isomorphism analog appeals directly to the characteristics of the critical state of the ising model . this reflects the fact of the isomorphism of critical behavior of the fluid the ising model @xcite .",
    "moreover , it relates _ nonuniversal _ parameters of the critical state of these systems ( see also @xcite ) which isomorphic in a sense of fluctuational theory of critical phenomena @xcite . according to eq .",
    "the ccf depends on the temperature scale @xmath25 but not on @xmath71 . to consider the case of the lj - fluid we take into account that for the lj potential : @xmath72 @xmath73 and the relation between the lj parameter @xmath74 and the spin - spin interaction @xmath75 of the ising model is @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "we assume that the lj parameter @xmath74 can be identified with the interaction constant of the lattice gas .",
    "this is based on the fact that @xmath74 is the energy of the lj interaction at equilibrium distance .",
    "the latter can be identified with the period of the cubic lattice .",
    "further we use conventional dimensionless units for the temperature @xmath77 density @xmath78 and pressure @xmath79 .    calculation of the factors in results in : @xmath80 which correlates well with the ccf value for simple fluids . the corresponding estimate for the value of critical pressure",
    "is : @xmath81 and shows good correspondence with the result of simulations @xcite @xmath82 for the 3d lj fluid .",
    "our main result can be also applied in 2d case . due to the onzager s solution we know the basic quantities exactly : @xmath83 we get the estimate : @xmath84 the value of the critical pressure of the 2d lj fluid is : @xmath85 the estimates for critical density and temperature are consistent with known results for two dimensional lj fluid @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath2 and @xmath1 lower than those obtained within perturbation theory @xmath86 and in simulations @xmath87 @xcite . possible explanation of this fact is that these approaches underestimate the flatness of the binodal of the 2d lj fluid .",
    "this is due to the global power law behavior with the critical exponent @xmath88 because of the global isomorphism with the 2d ising model @xcite . for convenience all the parameters and the results obtained",
    "are summarized in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    ".the results for the critical point parameters of @xmath89 fluid in 2d and 3d cases . for 2d case @xmath90 and @xmath91 in 3d @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "naturally , the modification of the global isomorphism approach is needed in case of more complex fluids . from such point of view the thermodynamic class of similarity",
    "is determined by both a ) the structure of the lattice of the isomorphic model and b ) the correction of parameter @xmath38 due to repulsive part of the interaction . as to the first point the existence of such lattice model",
    "is provided by the lrd and the zeno - linearity .",
    "the second point rises the problem to include into consideration other invariants like pitzer s acentric factor @xmath43 or riedel parameter @xcite .",
    "such parameters on the phenomenological level represent the shape of the molecules",
    ". therefore they can be related with the hard - core effects due to repulsive part of the potential .",
    "this issue needs further studies .",
    "here we briefly outline the simplest phenomenological way .",
    "the idea is to use eq .   with the parameter @xmath38 dependent on the acentric factor @xmath43",
    "so that : @xmath92 where @xmath93 to introduce @xmath43-dependence for eq .",
    "in our approach we use the result of @xcite for the parameter @xmath94 : @xmath95 as has been noted above @xmath96 .",
    "so we introduce @xmath97 as the fitting parameter : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is given by eq .  .",
    "the result of the best fit to the data gives @xmath100 and shown in fig  [ fig_zcmy ] by solid line .",
    "given by eq .",
    "( see text ) on the acentric factor @xmath43 ( solid line ) . for the comparison the result of eq .",
    "( see @xcite ) is shown by dashed line.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    if one takes the value @xmath101 for the boyle temperature of the lj - fluid then @xmath102 , which is in perfect agreement with the value of the boyle temperature in vdw approximation @xmath103 .",
    "this shows self - consistency of the procedure based on representation eq .   with eq .",
    "at least for the substance with low ( @xmath104 ) acentric factor .",
    "for comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig_zcmy ] we represent the data for the values of @xmath2 and corresponding acentric factor @xmath43 . based on the results of @xcite ] here",
    "the points are the values of @xmath2 according to the cp locus data ( see @xcite ) .",
    "dashed curve is the fitting curve of the form @xmath105 which is based on the timmermanns relation and the results of @xcite .    for the substance with higher values of @xmath43 and low values of @xmath2",
    "further improvement should be related with the lattice structure of the isomorphic lattice model .",
    "obviously , this is because simple cubic lattice is oversimplified model for the fluids with molecules of highly nonspherical shape .",
    "in conclusion we discuss the main result of the work and comment on further developments .",
    "we have derived the relation between the ccf of the lj fluid and that of the lattice model of ising like type .",
    "the obtained relation reproduces the known value of @xmath2 for simple liquids basing on the available data for the 3d ising model .",
    "the analogous relation can be derived for more complex fluids . in view of the global isomorphism approach",
    "they are those fluids for which the lrd and the zeno linearity holds with good accuracy . according to the results of @xcite",
    "water and liquid alkali metals can be considered this way though the ccf is much lower ( @xmath106 ) than the value @xmath2 of simple fluids . according to simple pcs",
    "these liquids belong to other class of the thermodynamic similarity . yet",
    "the equilibrium thermostatic properties of these fluids are mainly formed by the polarizational short range forces .",
    "thus proper generalization of the pcs , e.g. in the framework of the global isomorphism approach can be elaborated e.g. in order to take into account the associative features of such fluids .",

    "s. vorobev for kindly sending some recent papers relevant to the subject .",
    "the unknown referee is acknowledged for providing the results for @xmath107 based on the data of @xcite and stimulating discussion as to the inclusion of acentric factor @xmath43 into consideration .",
