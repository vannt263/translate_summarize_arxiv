    "the study of galaxy formation and evolution will gain an enormous boost from space - borne observations in the infrared ( ir ) , first with the advent of the space infrared telescope facility ( sirtf ) and then , at the end of this decade , with the appearance of the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) .",
    "sirtf , scheduled for launch in early 2003 , will allow us to efficiently observe distant galaxies at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "in particular , sirtf s infrared array camera ( irac ) will operate at 3.6@xmath0 m , 4.5@xmath0 m , 5.8@xmath0 m , and 8@xmath0 m , providing a window on the rest - frame near - ir properties of galaxies at @xmath2@xmath41 .",
    "a number of deep sirtf imaging surveys that will detect many thousands of galaxies to high redshift are already scheduled ( e.g. , goods , swire ) , and it will be enormously important to efficiently estimate redshifts of galaxies in these samples",
    ". however , large - scale spectroscopic follow - up of these ir - selected surveys will be very time - consuming and only small sub - samples of objects are likely to be targeted . instead , spectroscopic redshifts are likely to be complemented by the less precise but much more efficient photometric redshifts .",
    "photometric redshifts enjoy great popularity as a way to estimate the redshifts of faint galaxies ( e.g. , connolly et al .",
    "1995 ; gwyn & hartwick 1996 ; sawicki , lin , & yee 1997 ; fernndez - soto , lanzetta , & yahil 1999 ; rudnick et al .",
    "traditionally , photometric redshifts rely on the photometric signatures of the lyman and 4000breaks to estimate redshifts from optical and near - ir data .",
    "however , the availability of mid - ir data from sirtf ( and , later , ngst ) surveys opens up the possibility of using a hitherto untried photometric redshift technique that could obviate the need for optical imaging of sirtf and ngst survey fields , or provide independent redshift estimates where such imaging is already present .",
    "specifically , the spectral `` bump '' at 1.6@xmath0 m , caused by the minimum in the opacity of the h@xmath1 ion present in the atmospheres of cool stars , is a nearly ubiquitous feature of almost all stellar populations and the photometric signature of this bump can be expected to provide a means of estimating redshifts to distant galaxies .",
    "the importance of the imprint of the 1.6@xmath0 m bump  on sirtf irac colors has been appreciated for a long time ( e.g. , wright , eisenhardt , & fazio 1994 ) , and indeed the filter transmission curves of the irac filters have been designed partially with photometric redshifts in mind by modeling the expected colors of high-@xmath2 galaxies ( simpson & eisenhardt 1999 ) . the purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate the potential of the 1.6@xmath0 m  bump as a photometric redshift indicator and to explore some of the possible limitations of the technique at high redshift .",
    "section  [ lowz ] illustrates , with real data at 0@xmath10@xmath2@xmath101 , that the 1.6@xmath0 m  bump _ is _ an effective photometric redshift indicator and describes the source of the photometric redshift signal .",
    "section  [ sirtf ] discusses the applicability of the technique to sirtf irac data and explores some of the limitations that could be present at high redshift due to effects such as metallicity , dust , and star formation history .",
    "the main conclusions of the paper are summarized and discussed in section  [ summary ] .",
    "the opacity of the h@xmath1 ion has a minimum at @xmath111.6@xmath0 m  ( e.g. , john 1988 ) , which imprints itself as a maximum , or `` bump , '' on the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of cool stars .",
    "consequently , the seds of composite stellar populations that contain significant numbers of such stars can be expected to possess the same spectral imprint .",
    "this assertion is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ seds.fig ] , which shows the spectral energy distributions of model stellar populations from the 1996 version of the gissel spectral synthesis code of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) .",
    "the 1.6@xmath0 m  bump is easily discernible in all but the extremely young ( @xmath111  myr ) stellar populations , where it is swamped by the essentially power - law spectra of very hot , massive young stars . given the strength and near universality of the 1.6@xmath0 m  bump , it is reasonable to expect that it will imprint a significant signal on the colors of distant galaxies , and hence , as was pointed out by simpson & eisenhardt ( 1999 ) , that it might make a good photometric redshift indicator .",
    "while the 1.6@xmath0 m  bump has been suggested as a photometric redshift indicator before , its feasibility remains to be tested with real data .",
    "the @xmath3 filter set straddles the 1.6@xmath0 m bump  at @xmath2@xmath1201 , and so @xmath3 photometry of hubble deep field ( hdf ; williams et al .",
    "1996 ) galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts will be used to test if the 1.6@xmath0 m bump  can provide a strong enough photometric imprint to constrain redshifts .",
    "note that the @xmath3 filter set provides a reasonable surrogate of the irac quartet of bandpasses , albeit shifted by a factor of @xmath112.53 in observed wavelength : while filters of the @xmath3 set cover the rest - frame 1.6@xmath0 m bump  for galaxies at @xmath2@xmath1201 , the corresponding redshift range for the irac filters is @xmath2@xmath121.84 .",
    "consequently , @xmath3 photometric redshifts of @xmath2@xmath101 galaxies provide a useful demonstration of how well sirtf may do at these higher redshifts .",
    "nine galaxies were detected at @xmath13-band ( 3.2@xmath0 m ) in the deep keck imaging of the hdf by hogg et al .",
    "all nine have redshifts at 0@xmath10@xmath2@xmath101 , as measured by cohen et al .",

    "the resulting 2-aperture magnitudes are listed in table  [ photometry.tab ] .",
    "photometric redshifts of the nine galaxies were estimated by comparing their observed broadband spectral energy distributions ( as listed in table  [ photometry.tab ] ) with model templates generated from the 1996 version of the gissel spectral synthesis package ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) .",
    "solar - metallicity gissel spectra of constant star formation rate ( sfr ) , and with ages spanning the full available range of models ( 020 gyr ) , were used as the starting point in the construction of the templates .",
    "these model spectra were redshifted onto a grid of redshifts spanning @xmath2=01.5 in steps of @xmath15=0.05 , and were then integrated through the filter transmission curves ( ftcs ) to produce the template broadband fluxes @xmath16 in the four filters @xmath17=(@xmath18 ) .",
    "the resulting grid contains 6851 templates , each of four broadband fluxes , and spans 0@xmath19@xmath2@xmath191.5 linearly and 0@xmath19age@xmath1920  gyr quasi - logarithmically .    for each observed object ,",

    "1997 , arnouts et al.1999 ) , with the key difference being that the data and templates used here do not span the traditional 4000  or lyman breaks , but , instead , cover the 1.6@xmath0 m bump .",

    "the scatter between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is only @xmath29=0.09 , which is similar to the scatter typically obtained over the same redshift range in the hdf using the balmer - break sensitive optical photometric redshift techniques ( e.g. , sawicki et al .",
    "1997 ; fernndez - soto et al .",
    "although the comparison between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is based on the very small sample of nine galaxies , the tight correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath30 demonstrates , for the first time , that the 1.6@xmath0 m  bump is a viable indicator of redshift .      to understand how the 1.6@xmath0 m  bump",
    "produces a photometric redshift signature , it is instructive to consider how the infrared colors of galaxies depend on redshift .",
    "the @xmath3 filter set used in  [ hdf ] can be represented as six constituent colors ; fig .",
    "[ jhkl_colours.fig ] shows these six colors for gissel models of constantly star - forming stellar populations of seven different ages .",
    "the solid lines represent colors of stellar populations ranging in age from 20 myr to 20 gyr , while the dotted line is for the extremely young 1 myr - old population .    for the extremely young , 1 myr - old model ,",
    "all six colors are virtually constant with redshift : the spectra of the very young , hot stars that dominate this ultra - young stellar population are essentially featureless rayleigh - jeans power laws ( see fig .",
    "[ seds.fig ] ) and because redshifting a power law does not affect its spectral shape , the colors of extremely young stellar populations remain degenerate with redshift . consequently , the redshift of a galaxy dominated by an extremely young stellar population can not be determined photometrically .",
    "fortunately , stellar populations older than a few myr develop the 1.6@xmath0 m  bump ( see fig .  [ seds.fig ] ) , and it is the passage of this bump through the @xmath3 filter set that imprints itself on the colors of galaxies in fig .",
    "[ jhkl_colours.fig ] . for the remainder of this section",
    ", extremely young ( @xmath111 myr - old ) stellar populations will be ignored and the analysis will focus on the more prosaic models with age@xmath3110 myr .    clearly , colors which are degenerate with redshift can not provide redshift information : for example , the @xmath32@xmath33@xmath8  colors of all model ages are essentially flat with redshift and so @xmath32@xmath33@xmath8  contains little information about redshift .",
    "in contrast , where a color changes steeply with redshift , such as @xmath9@xmath33@xmath13  over 0.4@xmath6@xmath2@xmath60.8 , it provides strong redshift signal .",
    "however , to be useful , the color must not only change steeply , but must also be unique with redshift : thus , although the @xmath32@xmath33@xmath13  color changes steeply with redshift at @xmath32@xmath33@xmath13=@xmath330.5 , it does not constrain redshift well since models of different age produce that same color at different redshifts .",
    "therefore , the requirements for a color to be a good photometric redshift indicator are that ( 1 ) it change steeply with redshift and ( 2 ) it be unique for a given redshift .",
    "[ jhkl_colours.fig ] shows that @xmath32@xmath33@xmath8  is a poor redshift indicator over all redshifts @xmath2@xmath101.5 ; @xmath8@xmath33@xmath9  is fine only at @xmath2@xmath110 ; @xmath32@xmath33@xmath9  would be fine at low redshift were it not for the fact that in this color @xmath2@xmath120 objects are degenerate with young stellar populations at @xmath2@xmath41 ; @xmath32@xmath33@xmath13  is fine at @xmath2@xmath120 , @xmath8@xmath33@xmath13  at 0@xmath6@xmath2@xmath60.4 , and @xmath9@xmath33@xmath13  at 0.4@xmath6@xmath2@xmath60.8 .",
    "thus , the success of the @xmath3 filter set at determining the redshifts of the nine hdf galaxies is primarily due to the @xmath8@xmath33@xmath13  color below @xmath2@xmath120.4 and @xmath9@xmath33@xmath13  at higher @xmath2 .",
    "the two most useful colors , @xmath8@xmath33@xmath13  at @xmath2@xmath60.4 and @xmath9@xmath33@xmath13  at @xmath2@xmath40.4 , have an important feature in common : they both contain the longest - wavelength @xmath13 filter .",
    "the role of this filter may be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ seds.fig ] : at all redshifts @xmath2@xmath61 , the @xmath13 filter is redward of the 1.6@xmath0 m bump   i.e. , at wavelengths at which the spectra of virtually all stellar populations are nearly identical .",
    "thus , the @xmath13 filter provides a universal `` anchor , '' which is independent of galaxy type .",
    "the role that the other two filters ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) play now becomes apparent : while @xmath13 acts as a redshift - invariant anchor , the 1.6@xmath0 m bump  moves with increasing redshift first through @xmath32 and then through @xmath9",
    ". the passage of the 1.6@xmath0 m bumpthrough the @xmath32 and @xmath9 bandpasses depresses the fluxes in these filters with respect to the invariant @xmath13-band anchor , thus resulting in the steep yet age - invariant evolution of the @xmath8@xmath33@xmath13  and @xmath9@xmath33@xmath13  colors over 0@xmath6@xmath2@xmath60.4 and 0.4@xmath6@xmath2@xmath60.8 , respectively .    as is shown in fig .",

    "galaxy colors become strongly dependent on age and , consequently , at @xmath2@xmath40.4 , the @xmath8@xmath33@xmath13  color develops an age - redshift degeneracy .",
    "however , the @xmath9@xmath33@xmath13  color takes over at @xmath2@xmath40.4 as a redshift indicator , and the @xmath8@xmath33@xmath13  color now can assume a different role  that of providing information about the evolutionary state of the galaxy s stellar population !    the above discussion illustrates the general principle of selecting filters for measuring redshifts using the 1.6@xmath0 m bump : one needs an `` anchor '' filter which will at all redshifts of interest remain in the age - invariant part of the spectrum redward of the 1.6@xmath0 m bump .",
    "furthermore , one needs a filter whose bandpass corresponds to the wavelengths through which the 1.6@xmath0 m bump  will be passing in the redshift range of interest . a third filter",
    "can then be deployed in the age - sensitive region blueward of the 1.6@xmath0 m bump  to gain information about the state ( age ) of the galaxy s stellar population .",
    "finally , to cover an extensive redshift range , a set of adjacent filters is necessary so that the filters can take over from each other at different redshifts . in practice , of course",
    ", fluxes from all available filters contribute when the photometric redshift is determined via @xmath34 minimization of broadband spectral energy distributions ; nevertheless , the bulk of the photometric redshift signal at a given redshift @xmath2 comes from the combination of a long - wavelength anchor bandpass and a bump - containing filter at @xmath35@xmath12@xmath361.6@xmath0 m .",
    "armed with the understanding of how the 1.6@xmath0 m bump  interacts with broadband filters , let us consider how the sirtf irac 3.6@xmath0 m , 4.5@xmath0 m , 5.8@xmath0 m , 8@xmath0mbandpasses can be used to estimate redshifts .",
    "the 8@xmath0 m  bandpass is the reddest of the irac filters and so it naturally serves as the long - wavelength anchor . in combination with the 8@xmath0 m  anchor , the bluer 3.6@xmath0 m , 4.5@xmath0 m , and 5.8@xmath0 m  bandpasses then provide the bulk of the photometric redshift signal over different redshift ranges .",

    ", they are sensitive to the presence of the co absorption band at 2.4@xmath0 m .",
    "the interplay of the irac filters with the co band results in a series of `` wiggles '' in the colors at @xmath2@xmath612 .",
    "these wiggles make the irac colors degenerate at low redshift and so restrict the redshift range over which irac photometry can be used to measure redshift .",
    "let us now consider in more detail what biases and uncertainties can be expected when trying to determine redshifts using sirtf irac photometry .",
    "photometric redshift measurements can be biased , sometimes catastrophically , by random errors in photometry , as well as , in a more systematic way , by incorrect assumptions about the target galaxy s spectral energy distribution .",

    "high-@xmath2 galaxies can be shrouded by substantial amounts of interstellar dust .",

    "because interstellar dust tends to preferentially suppress flux in the blue , it can be expected to both shift the apparent wavelength of the 1.6@xmath0 m bumpand to make the stellar population appear older .    to study the effect that dust may have on the accuracy of photometric redshifts , templates constructed from constantly star - forming , @xmath42=0.2 @xmath43 , dust - free gissel models ( i.e. , identical to those in  [ photometricerrors ] ) were used to fit `` observed '' galaxies that had the same metallicity and star formation history as these fitting templates , but were reddened with @xmath48=0.3 following the calzetti ( 1997 ) starburst dust curve .",

    "thus , while the redshifts of metal - rich high-@xmath2 galaxies should be recovered faithfully , irac colors alone are not sufficient to unambiguously identify high-@xmath2 , very metal - poor galaxies that are dominated by young stellar populations ( see also simpson & eisenhardt , 1999 ) .",

    "the analysis of the dependence of galaxy colors on redshift (  [ source_of_signal ] ) leads to the conclusion that photometric redshift signal at a given redshift comes primarily from two filters : an `` anchor '' filter which at all redshifts of interest remains in the invariant part of the spectrum redward of the 1.6@xmath0 m bump , and a second filter whose redshifted bandpass corresponds to 1.6@xmath0 m . to cover an extensive redshift range and to reduce redshift degeneracies",
    ", one needs  in addition to the long - wavelength anchor filter that is always redward of ( 1+@xmath2)1.6@xmath0m multiple filters that span the possible range of redshifted 1.6@xmath0 m .",
    "filters that are located blueward of the redshifted 1.6@xmath0 m bump  do not constrain redshift well , but instead provide information about the age of the stellar population . in this manner",
    ", the @xmath55 filter set was used to determine redshifts of galaxies at @xmath2@xmath1201 ( the @xmath32 filter does not provide redshift information but could be used as an age indicator ) , while the sirtf irac 3.6@xmath0 m , 4.5@xmath0 m , 5.8@xmath0 m , 8@xmath0 m  filters can be expected to work at higher redshifts .",
    "simulations (  [ photometricerrors ] ) suggest that sirtf irac colors alone may be sufficient to measure photometric redshifts of high-@xmath2 galaxies , provided that care is taken to reject the degenerate objects whose fits claim them to be either at @xmath2@xmath61.5 or younger than @xmath1120 myr ( these redshift and age cut - offs can be adjusted depending on the levels of completeness and contamination that are acceptable ) . at higher redshifts ( @xmath2@xmath42.5 )",
    "low-@xmath2 contaminants can be separated from young high-@xmath2 galaxies by the addition of uv - optical data that are sensitive to the presence of the lyman break ; at @xmath2@xmath61.5 , the accuracy of photometric redshifts would be restored with the addition of @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands .    as was illustrated in ",
    "[ systematics ] , the ability to determine photometric redshifts from irac photometry should not be significantly compromised by the unknown metallicities , dust content , and star formation histories of high-@xmath2 galaxies . provided the caveats about rejecting galaxies with @xmath5@xmath61.5 or",
    "age@xmath7@xmath620myr are followed , sirtf - based photometric redshifts should provide a powerful way to estimate the redshifts of distant galaxies .",
    "with sirtf irac data alone , photometric redshifts can be expected to be most accurate for galaxies at @xmath2@xmath122 , with the accuracy decreasing to higher redshifts ; they can be expected to be completely inaccurate for galaxies at @xmath2@xmath61.5 .",
    "the epoch at @xmath2@xmath122 is the transitional era where the cosmic star formation appears to plateau ( e.g. , sawicki , lin , & yee 1997 ; steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) after its rapid rise with lookback time over 0@xmath10@xmath2@xmath61 ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ) ; the expected high accuracy of irac photometric redshifts at @xmath2@xmath122 means that sirtf surveys are well - poised to study galaxies at this hitherto unexplored epoch of transition .",
    "although the 1.6@xmath0 m bump  can be used to provide a good estimate of redshift from sirtf data , particularly at @xmath2@xmath122 , ages of stellar populations can not be determined with great precision from sirtf data alone at any redshift : large scatter in age@xmath7  can be expected in the presence of even small photometric uncertainties (  [ photometricerrors ] ) , while significant systematic effects will be present due to the unknown metallicity , star formation history , and dust content of the target galaxy (  [ systematics ] ) .",
    "the addition of optical and near - ir data could alleviate some of these problems : while sirtf data are used to estimate redshifts , near - ir data that span the age - sensitive rest - frame 4000  break can be added to estimate ages , and dust effects can be constrained in the rest - uv with optical data ( see , e.g. , sawicki & yee , 1998 ) .",
    "the addition of spectroscopic redshifts might then free the sirtf photometry to be used to better constrain star formation histories and/or metallicities of distant galaxies .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to explore what constraints can be placed on the evolutionary parameters of high-@xmath2 galaxies by multiwavelength photometry augmented by spectroscopic redshifts ; however , such studies that combine spectroscopy with photometry that ranges from rest - frame uv to ir are sure to be an important path to understanding the nature of distant galaxies .",
    "although  [ hdf ] illustrates that reliable photometric redshifts are possible using the 1.6@xmath0 m bump , the essential test of the 1.6@xmath0 m bump  as a photometric redshift indicator for sirtf will come only in the form of a comparison between spectroscopic redshifts and photometric ones based on sirtf data .",
    "the 1.6@xmath0 m bump  technique is expected to be most useful at @xmath2@xmath122  precisely where our ability to determine spectroscopic redshifts is limited by the lack of readily accessible strong spectral features .",
    "however , we should be able to reliably assemble large samples of @xmath2@xmath122 galaxies by first using photometric redshifts to select @xmath2@xmath122 candidates , then obtaining spectroscopic redshifts using deep spectroscopy that targets absorption lines that are weak but accessible in the optical ( e.g. , 1550 , 1670 ) , and finally using the spectroscopic redshifts to test and calibrate the photometric redshifts .",
    "the 1.6@xmath0 m bump  photometric redshift technique applied to sirtf ( and , later , ngst ) data appears to be ideally suited to allow a detailed study of galaxies at the crucial epoch around @xmath2@xmath122 .",
