    "the unprecedented power of the _ kepler _ space telescope in terms of precision and continuity is poised to deliver major breakthroughs in exoplanet science @xcite and stellar photometry @xcite allowing exploration of territories never tested before .",
    "new instruments often reveal surprising new phenomena and lead to new insights in ( astro)physical problems .",
    "such an unforeseen feature , _ period doubling _ ( hereafter pd ) and the corresponding half - integer frequencies ( hereafter hifs ) were reported by @xcite in the _ kepler _ q1 data ( 34 days ) of rr  lyr , the prototype , brightest blazhko - type rr lyrae star in the sky .",

    "@xcite carried out the first systematic search of irregular oscillations in radiative and strongly dissipative pop .",

    "they demonstrated that the pulsations in those models undergo a _",
    "feigenbaum cascade _ of period doubling bifurcations by changing the control parameter ( effective temperature ) .",
    "that is to say the instability develops from strict periodic pulsation to period - two , period - four etc .",
    ", oscillations resulting in low dimensional chaos .    @xcite and @xcite reported period doubling bifurcation , as well , in purely radiative cepheid and blher model sequences . by changing the control parameter ( @xmath0 ) , their weakly dissipative pop .",
    "i. cepheid models showed the onset of period doubling and a subsequent reversion to period - one oscillations instead of further period - doubling episodes , in contrast with the more dissipative models .",
    "nonlinear stable periodic pulsations ( limit cycles ) can be made to period double through the destabilization of either a thermal ( real ) mode or an additional ( complex ) vibrational mode .",
    "@xcite could trace the origin of the pd to be a destabilized low - lying vibrational overtone and that the coupling occurs through an internal resonance of the type @xmath1 where _ n _ in an integer ( 1 or 2 ) and the subscripts 0 and _ k _ refer to the fundamental and the _ k_th overtone modes , respectively . in this case",
    "the parametric instability of an overtone pulsation mode in half - integer resonance opens up an additional dimension which allows the limit cycle to period double .    in this paper",
    "we describe our discovery of the period doubling phenomenon in three rr  lyrae variables observed by the _ kepler _ space telescope .",
    "one of them is rr  lyr ( kic7198959 , kepler mag : 7.9 ) the prototype of its class .",
    "v808  cyg ( kic4484128 ) and v355  lyr ( kic7505345 ) , the two other rrab stars are of much fainter apparent brightness ( @xmath2=15.4 and 14.1 , respectively ) .",
    "four additional _ kepler _ rr  lyrae stars show weak signs of the period - doubling phenomenon .",
    "all these objects show the enigmatic blazhko effect , _",
    "i.e. _ ,   amplitude and phase modulation of the regular rr  lyrae pulsation .",
    "for the recent _ kepler _ findings with respect to rr  lyr itself and an overview of the blazhko behavior of _ kepler _ rr  lyrae stars we refer to @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    since resonances are known to play much less of a role in rr  lyrae stars than in cepheids , it is natural to ask whether occurrence of any type of resonance between radial modes can cause this behavior .",
    "serendipitously , we encountered rr  lyrae models showing the pd bifurcation and subsequently we applied them to the _ kepler _ rr  lyrae stars .",
    "we were able to demonstrate that in rr  lyrae stars the physical origin of this instability is a 9:2 resonance between the fundamental mode and a high - order radial overtone .",
    "this latter mode is called a _ strange mode _",
    "@xcite , because it has no adiabatic counterpart and the energy associated with its pulsation is confined to the outer zones of the star .",
    "the goal of this work is to present the first _ kepler _ rr  lyrae period doubling results and our first successful modeling efforts .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "this requires the observation of @xmath3 main sequence stars continuously for several years with great accuracy .",
    "_ kepler _ was launched on 2009 march 6 , and observes a 105 square degree area of the sky in constellations cygnus and lyra , a few degrees above the galactic plane . after a short commissioning phase , the scientific observations started on may 12 . in order to ensure optimal solar irradiation of the solar arrays , a 90degree roll of the telescope is performed at the end of each quarter .",

    "we found that no detrending was necessary for our targets .",
    "jump corrections were also considered unnecessary for our purposes .",
    "we noticed that q1 and q2 mean brightness and amplitudes of a given pulsating star may differ .",
    "for our fainter targets only the mean brightness had to be adjusted between different rolls . in the case of rr",

    "ccds saturate between @xmath9 and @xmath10mag , but the saturated flux is conserved to a very high degree , spilling in the column direction .",
    "this allows _ kepler _ to perform high - precision photometry on saturated targets like rr  lyr as long as a sufficient number of pixels is captured in the column direction . in q1 and q2 ,",
    "a fraction of flux from rr  lyr fell outside the _ kepler _ aperture ( set of downlinked pixels ) , so extra care is required to assure that the period doubling phenomenon is not due to loss of flux in some cadences .",
    "we developed an approach that estimates a correction of the rr  lyr flux .",
    "part of the original and corrected light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ rrlyr_correction ] .",
    "the details of this method are described in @xcite .",
    "here we only note that in q1 the flux corrections in case of the rr  lyr were less than 5% , while in q2 the necessary flux corrections were larger , ranging from 15% to 35% .",
    "the uncertainty in the total corrected flux is about 0.25% .",
    "this is to be compared with the flux uncertainty of @xmath11 in cadences where the correction was not applied because the flux was completely captured . for comparison the uncertainty of the ( uncorrected ) flux for the two fainter stars showing the period doubling varies between @xmath12 for v808  cyg and @xmath13 for v355  lyr .",
    "because these corrections are estimates , we provide the following evidence that the period doubling phenomenon in q2 rr  lyr data is not due to loss of flux :            * similar alternating cycles are seen in the flux time series of individual pixels , as well as the sum of pixels along columns with significant flux ( other than the central column ) from rr  lyr ( see fig .  [ adjacentcolumns ] ) . in individual pixels , the period doubling signal is much larger than the pixel - level noise , which is dominated by pointing jitter and shot noise . * saturated pixels induce a faint video crosstalk signal on other ccd channels . at its maximum , crosstalk from the saturated flux from rr  lyr impinged on a faint observed target , and this crosstalk signal is consistent with the reconstructed light curve including period doubling . *",
    "_ kepler _ light curves are created using pixels in a photometrically optimal aperture that maximizes the signal to noise ratio for the target @xcite . _",
    "kepler _ downlinks a superset of these pixels @xcite including at least a 1-pixel halo around the photometrically optimal aperture . in the case of q1 and q2 observations of rr",
    "lyr , significantly more pixels were downlinked .",
    "flux light curves created using all downlinked pixels exhibit essentially the same period doubling phenomenon as the light curve generated from the photometrically optimal pixels .",
    "this demonstrates that period doubling is not due to loss of flux from the ( smaller ) optimal aperture other than the central saturated column . *",
    "perhaps the strongest evidence that period doubling is not due to loss of flux is that the period doubling phenomenon was seen in q1 when the flux from rr  lyr was completely captured .",
    "* the fact that three stars were found unambiguously showing the pd effect further helps in ruling out external influences .",
    "the bright rr  lyr and the two much fainter stars ( v808  cyg and v355  lyr ) demonstrate that the same effect is operational at two different parts of the dynamical range of the ccds .",
    "in addition , all three stars fell on different ccd - modules and the modules were rotated between q1 and q2 , so the pd effect is independent of the ccd - modules .",
    "based on the analysis described in this section , we have high confidence that the period doubling phenomenon is not due to instrumental effects .",
    "period doubling is found in three of the blazhko stars in the _ kepler _ field : rr  lyr ( kic7198959 ) , v808  cyg ( kic4484128 ) and v355  lyr ( kic7505345 ) . some of their properties can be found in table .",
    "[ tab1 ] . the pulsational period , the blazhko period and the amplitude of the first fourier - component ( @xmath14 ) were derived from the available _ kepler _ observations .",

    "the upper panels of figs [ rrlyr ] and [ v808cyg ] show the q1+q2 light curves for rr  lyr and v808  cyg in the @xmath2 band .",
    "the individual maxima and minima were fitted with a 9th order polynomial to test the effect of the 29.4-min sampling which may undersample the rapidly changing light curve around the maxima .",
    "we find no significant problem arising from the long - cadence sampling .",
    "certain parts of the light curves are marked with dotted line rectangles and are magnified to discern the alternating maxima and minima in figs [ rrlyr_seg ] and [ v808cyg_seg ] .",
    "the fitted maxima and minima are plotted as horizontal bars to guide the eye in these figures . in the case of rr",
    "lyr a difference of @xmath15 is seen in the brightness of subsequent maxima .",

    "i.e. _ ,  @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ) in the frequency spectrum are typical signs of the period doubling bifurcation . for the frequency analysis we used sigspec @xcite . where available , q1 and q2 data sets were merged .",
    "when the spectral significance reached the conservative value 5 the procedure was stopped , although the traces of hifs can be followed up to the nyquist - frequency ( 24.5c / d ) .",
    "the results were checked by period04 @xcite .",
    "only minor differences were found , mainly in the phase values .    in our third case , v355  lyr ,",
    "the pd effect is undoubtedly present , but is rather weak ( fig .",
    "[ v355lyr_seg ] ) .",
    "the maximum amplitude of the 3/2@xmath18 frequency is 5  mmag , while it is 25  mmag for the two other targets .",
    "this translates to a few hundredths of a magnitude difference in consecutive maxima or minima .",
    "interestingly , the amplitude modulation is also small for this star .",
    "four other blazhko rr  lyrae stars in the _ kepler _ field are seen to possibly exhibit the pd effect : v2178  cyg ( kic3864443 ) , v354  lyr ( kic6183128 ) , v445  lyr ( kic6186029 ) and v360  lyr ( kic9697825 ) . in their frequency spectra peaks",
    "were found close to the predicted half - integer frequencies .",
    "however , our criteria for the detection of the pd effect were the clear sign of alternating height of the pulsation cycles as well as the simultaneous presence of a large number of hifs ( preferably more than eight ) .",
    "if any of these two requirements were not met by a star , we consider it as a possible pd object only .",
    "we note that some of these four stars in this category show additional frequencies making their frequency spectrum more complex . for more details on these stars",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "from now on we turn to our three stars that show securely detected pd phenomenon .",
    "we plotted the averaged amplitudes of the hifs of these stars in fig .",
    "[ hif_ampl ] taken from their frequency spectra .",
    "it is interesting to note that in all three cases the 3/2@xmath18 frequency has the highest amplitude among the half - integer frequency peaks , next comes 5/2@xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this appears to be a general feature of the pd phenomenon in blazhko stars . around the fifth half - integer frequency , ( _ i.e. _ ,  @xmath20 )",
    "a pronounced bump is seen in the amplitude distribution .",
    "the origin of this bump is explained in detail in sec .",
    "the amplitude of the higher - order half - integer peaks are decreasing more or less steadily with the order number @xmath21 .",
    "after discussing the time - averaged properties of the hifs we now turn to investigate their temporal behavior .",
    "the lower panels of figs [ rrlyr ] and [ v808cyg ] for rr  lyr and v808  cyg respectively , show the temporal behavior of the amplitude of the most prominent half - integer frequencies in the frequency spectra .",
    "these were computed using the _ analytic signal method _",
    "@xcite , a powerful method developed to follow time - dependent signals .",
    "we note here that the method is superior compared to other time - dependent fourier - methods , but has a drawback : in the presence of large gaps the procedure does not yield reliable results , therefore we had to cut the neighborhood of the missing data .",
    "we found a @xmath22c / d bandwidth to give the most stable results , and a @xmath23d long data segment is lost in each side of a gap .",
    "the relatively broad bandwidth means that sometimes more than one frequency peak is contained in the computed interval but the insensitivity to noise compensates for this disadvantage .",
    "we tested that the temporal behavior of the hifs is not flawed by the chosen bandwidth .",
    "it is obvious from figs [ rrlyr ] and [ v808cyg ] that the intensity of the period doubling phenomenon is changing with time . for rr  lyr",
    "it has maximum strength on the ascending branch of the blazhko envelope on the first two rising branches , and is much less visible during the third ascending branch of the blazhko modulation . the difference in brightness between consecutive maxima reaches as high as @xmath24mag when pd is strongest .",
    "the visible alternating extrema can be seen where the amplitude of the hifs is high , and no significant alternation is found where the amplitude is low .",
    "this is true for all our target stars throughout the whole light curve in each case . in rr",
    "lyr the amplitudes of the hifs never vanish , in other words the pd effect is always present .",
    "[ fourier_seg ] demonstrates the difference of the strength of the hifs showing the discrete fourier transforms of the second and third marked segments of the rr  lyr light curve as shown in fig .",
    "[ rrlyr ] .",
    "we prewhitened with the main pulsation frequency and its harmonics ( but not with the blazhko side - peaks ) for better visibility of the hifs .",
    "it is discernible that the half - integer frequencies are present in both data segments , with a factor of three difference in the amplitudes .",
    "we can conclude that the pd effect is transient and varies with the blazhko cycle .    in the case of v808",
    "cyg the pd effect is practically seen throughout the whole 133-d observational period , albeit with outstanding maxima of the hifs during the ascending branch of the blazhko envelope , close to the blazhko maximum and during the descending branch .",
    "the minimum level of the half - integer frequencies is not as low as for rr  lyr , but the maximum height is similar .",
    "again , there is a clear connection of the pd effect to the blazhko modulation , very similar to the case of rr  lyr , but with enhanced intensity and an additional maximum height during the descending branch of the blazhko envelope .",
    "one can see numerous peaks in the vicinity of the half - integer frequencies ( fig .",
    "[ freq_sim]c ) .",
    "in addition , we noticed that the highest frequency peak has a frequency ratio to @xmath18 that is significantly different from @xmath25 , namely @xmath26 .",
    "this is the combined effect of the blazhko modulation and the temporal onset and disappearance of the hifs . to test this hypothesis we performed the following check .",
    "we generated an artificial light curve sampled at the original data points .",
    "we took @xmath18 and its 16 harmonics of rr  lyr , their phases and amplitudes and modulated the amplitude and the phase with a fourier - sum of two terms and five terms , respectively .",
    "the resulting light curve is very similar to the observed one , but we note that the purpose of this simulation was to explain the frequency spectrum in the vicinity of the hifs and not the reproduction of the light curve .",
    "then we added the 1/2@xmath18 , 3/2@xmath18 , 5/2@xmath18 etc .",
    "frequency series with small amplitude .",
    "the same modulation is applied to these periodic signals , as well .",
    "we used @xmath27c / d in the simulation and applied mufran for the frequency analysis @xcite .",

    "specifically , the amplitudes of the hifs were varied as @xmath31 if @xmath32 and @xmath33 otherwise , _ i.e. _ ,  hifs are present only when the function is positive .",
    "@xmath34 denotes the modulation frequency .",
    "one can find at least 5 distinct peaks in the synthetic spectrum , the highest two of them are of similar amplitude .",
    "the frequencies of these peaks are : @xmath35c / d and @xmath36c / d , their frequency ratios are : @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "our simulation demonstrated convincingly that the large number of frequency peaks and the frequency ratio close to but not equal to @xmath25 are expected consequences of the modulated light curve , and we are dealing with a genuine period doubling effect .    summarizing our findings concerning the pd effect in three _ kepler _ blazhko rrab stars we conclude that this effect occurs in some but not all modulated rr  lyrae stars . for a given star its presence may be continuous , but there are specific phases of the blazhko cycle , where it gets much stronger ( up to five times in amplitude ) .",
    "this is not a strict rule , however .",
    "out of three rising branches of the blazhko modulation ( _ i.e. _ ,  envelope ) in rr  lyr we detected a strong presence of pd in the first two cases , and much weaker appearance during the third one .",

    "frequency spectra were computed for the 14 blazhko and 15 non - blazhko _ kepler _ rr  lyrae stars ) using sigspec and prewhitened successively with the highest frequency peaks .",
    "these were the dominant pulsational mode ( fundamental in each cases ) , its harmonics up to the nyquist - frequency and modulation side peaks in case of blazhko stars .",
    "the procedure was stopped when the amplitudes of the remaining peaks reached a spectral significance of @xmath40 . as the limit for the hif amplitudes",
    "we accept the amplitude corresponding to this spectral significance limit .",
    "we emphasize that this choice is conservative , because inspection of the location of the hifs showed that there were no frequency peaks up to an amplitude two to three times lower than our adopted limit of @xmath40 .",
    "two factors affect our detection limit , one is the brightness of the star and the other the complexity of the frequency spectrum ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we note in passing that the apparent magnitudes of the _ kepler _ rr  lyrae sample are in the range of @xmath41 , the notable exception being rr  lyr , which is much brighter .",
    "another source of error may be the lack of barycentric correction to the ( shorter ) q1 time series . while this is correction is important",
    ", we argue that it has no effect on our detection limit .",
    "first because it does not effect the alternating maxima and minima .",
    "second , although it may cause some systematics in the frequency spectrum , the basic structure of the hifs is well understood , as we demonstrated in the previous subsection .    as we mentioned in sec .",
    "[ amax ] . , we found four additional stars showing some hifs besides rr  lyr , v808  cyg and v355  lyr .",

    "resonance is not expected in the low order modes , however , the linear stability analysis of the model sequences shows that some of the higher ( 8th-10th ) overtones are unstable for some of the temperatures .",

    "the pd behavior strongly depends on the parameters of turbulent convection . using e.g. , the eddy viscosity as a control parameter , the bifurcation from limit cycle to period doubling is obtained .",
    "similarly the convective efficiency can play an important role as a control parameter .",
    "if one assumes that during the blazhko cycle the turbulent / convective structure of the star varies @xcite , it can result in the repeated occurrence of pd similarly to the observations .",
    "the high precision and continuity of the _ kepler _ space telescope has enabled us to discover a new phenomenon in blazhko rr  lyrae stars , namely _",
    "period doubling_. three stars were found to show this type of behavior unambiguously .",
    "one of them is the brightest representative of its class rr  lyr ( kic7198959 ) and the other two are much fainter modulated rrab variables , namely v808  cyg ( kic4484128 ) and v355  lyr ( kic7505345 ) . in addition , four other blazhko rr  lyrae stars in the _ kepler _ field may show signs of this new type of instability .",
    "period doubling manifests itself as alternating maxima and minima of pulsational cycles , sometimes even the shape of the light curve is alternating . as a consequence ,",
    "the fourier spectrum contains half - integer frequencies ( hifs ) , _ i.e. _ ,   frequency peaks midway between harmonics of the main pulsational frequency .",
    "interestingly enough , the intensity of the pd effect is time - dependent . in rr",
    "lyr it is most prominent during the ascending branch of the modulation in two blazhko cycles , while it is practically missing during the third ascending branch . in v808  cyg the pd effect is seen throughout the whole 133-d long data set , albeit with outstanding maxima of the half - integer frequencies during the ascending branch close to the blazhko maximum and during the descending branch . in v355",
    "lyr the pd effect is present , but it is rather weak , the maximum amplitude of the 3/2@xmath18 frequency is five times less than in the case of the two other targets .",
    "similarly , the amplitude modulation is also rather small for v355  lyr .",
    "this may hint at an intimate connection between the strength and of the blazhko modulation and the period - doubling effect .",
    "also , the fact that no pd effect was found in non - blazhko _ kepler _ rrab stars strongly suggests that this effect is connected to the blazhko effect .",
    "the structure of the hifs in the spectrum is found to be rather complex .",
    "we successfully demonstrated that the bunch of appearing frequency peaks in the vicinity of the expected hifs is due to the varying pulsational period throughout the modulation cycle , as well as the transient nature of the period doubling phenomenon .",
    "although deviations from regular single - periodic pulsation , _",
    "i.e. _ ,   cycle - to - cycle variations in rr  lyrae radial velocity curves @xcite and irregularities in photometric observations @xcite had already been detected from the ground , one might ask why the pd effect was not discovered despite the fact that the difference of the subsequent maxima during the pd episode may well be observable from the ground with accurate ccd photometry .",
    "firstly , 3/2@xmath18 ( the highest half - integer frequency in all three pd blazhko stars ) grows to 26mmag in the fourier - spectrum of rr  lyr when it shows maximum power",
    ". it may be visible only in well - sampled ( essentially continuous ) light curves which is very hard to obtain . before _",
    "most , corot _ and _ kepler _ no continuous rr  lyrae light curve was available .",
    "the compact , dedicated single - site observations @xcite and the limited multisite campaigns that have been organized for rr  lyrae stars @xcite did not yield the required coverage and accuracy to be able to detect the pd phenomenon .",
    "secondly , pulsation periods close to @xmath54 ( typical for rr  lyrae stars ) may hamper the detection , as from the ground one can follow only even or odd cycles every night and the duration of the maximum strength of the pd phenomenon as we see in _ kepler _ data is not long ( typically 810d ) . finally , period doubling itself is a transient phenomenon , not seen in every blazhko cycles .",
    "we estimate that the maximum pd strength phase ( _ i.e. _ ,  possibly observable from the ground ) lasts from 10% ( rr  lyr ) to 22% ( v808  cyg ) of the currently available time span covered by _ kepler _ observations . that s where the continuity and longevity of _ kepler _ observations have unbeatable advantage .",
    "in addition , strong pd occurs only in three stars out of 14 rr  lyrae exhibiting the blazhko modulation , while four additional modulated rr  lyrae stars show much weaker evidence for pd - like behavior .",
    "we conclude that it is not surprising that the transient pd effect remained unnoticed in decades - long ground - based rr  lyrae observations .",
    "the period - doubling bifurcation was reproduced successfully with the florida - budapest hydrocode which accounts for turbulent convection .",
    "we emphasize that not only the period doubling effect occurs naturally in our hydrodynamical models , but the time scale of the onset and fade - out of the pd effect is excellently reproduced , as well .",
    "our models of rr  lyrae stars demonstrated that period doubling is possible in these stars due to a 9:2 resonance of the fundamental and a high order ( 9th overtone ) mode .",
    "it was not expected that such a high order mode plays an important role in fundamental mode pulsations .",
    "however , it was found that this interacting mode is a strange mode , with a non - normal damping rate and eigenfunction .",
    "normal high order pulsation modes , with this extreme period ratio ( @xmath55 ) , are not able to destabilize the fundamental mode limit cycle and to induce a period doubling bifurcation . thus the observed period doubling characteristic in the _ kepler",
    "_ rr  lyrae stars provides a strong indirect evidence for the existence of strange modes in radial stellar pulsation , a phenomenon predicted theoretically by @xcite .",
    "the significant interaction of the strange mode to the fundamental mode pulsation also suggests that strange modes can play an important role in other phenomena , like three - mode resonances ( _ e.g. _ ,  among the fundamental , 1st/2nd , and the strange mode ) ; and perhaps it has an effect in shaping the blazhko effect as well .",
    "in addition , nonradial modes may also be involved in this complex dynamical interplay through resonant or non resonant interactions , as demonstrated by recent _",
    "findings in @xcite .",
    "we note that we found the strongest phase ( or equivalently period ) modulation in the cases of rr  lyr and v808  cyg among _ kepler _ blazhko stars @xcite , and these stars show the strongest pd effect .",
    "if we assume that during the blazhko cycle the turbulent / convective structure of the star varies as suggested by @xcite , it seems natural that in certain blazhko phases ( _ i.e. _ ,  when the physical conditions are favorable ) the pd effect appears , because in our models the pd behavior strongly depends on the parameters of turbulent convection .",
    "this sensitivity , together with the narrow parameter range where the necessary ( @xmath55 ) resonance is at work make this new - found phenomenon a precious tool for studying the mysterious blazhko effect .",
    "the understanding of the differences between pd and non - pd blazhko rr  lyrae stars , as well as the strong and feeble pd phases of a given star may provide the long - sought insight into the blazhko mechanism , offering a sensitive way to constrain our models .    with the release of additional _ kepler _ data it will be possible to further study the pd behavior and learn more about its temporal and transient nature .",
