    "the stellar spectra are shown in the order of the quality of the fit , with the best fit on top and the fourth - best fit on the bottom .",
    "the adopted reddening has little physical meaning given that the observed flux is not emanating from a stellar photosphere having the standard single - temperature sed ; this portion of the procedure merely serves as an automated process to vary the slope of the continuum , which is necessary given that  has a heavily extinguished spectrum .",
    "the pickles library is incomplete  it does not include every luminosity class for every spectral type . for this reason we emphasize that our procedure is only illustrative ; it does not provide a definitive spectral type for  in either the blue or red portion of the optical spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , a few trends are readily apparent from figure  [ opt - low - res ] . in the blue portion of the optical ,",
    "most closely resembles the spectra of g supergiants and g giants . in the red portion of the optical",
    ", the spectrum resembles that of g and k stars , with no real hint regarding the luminosity class .",
    "the adopted values of the reddening are significantly different between the blue and the red , but again we remind the reader that this reddening is only a device with which to match the intrinsic shape of the continuum . typically , the mg  i @xmath165172 triplet is used to determine the luminosity class of g - type stars , but our high - resolution spectra show that these lines are tracing an outflow ( see figure  [ hires - lines ] ) and thus they are unsuitable for providing a luminosity class . despite this ,",
    "the procedure does demonstrate that  is similar to g giants / supergiants in the blue portion of the optical , consistent with observations of other fu orionis variables @xcite .",
    "additionally , as we will show below , the spectrum shifts to later types ( k stars in this case ) with increasing wavelength , as is also observed in fu orionis variables @xcite .      the hires spectrum of  is dominated by broadened stellar - like absorption features .",
    "the spectral lines are consistent with those of a comparison g2  i star and inconsistent with spectral types later than early k. we note , however , that the diagnostics of g vs. k types are subtle and would become blurred with the large broadening of the  lines . the line broadening is similar to , but perhaps slightly less than , the 60100  broadening of v1057 cyg , and significantly more than the 3040  of v1515 cyg in which some hints of a k - type spectrum can be seen at redder optical wavelengths .",
    "a detailed comparison of  to these two canonical fu ori objects reveals that the spectrum of  is similar to both in terms of the relative strength of the common absorption features .",
    "however , we note that each object has unique and notable spectroscopic attributes .",
    "several lines have clear kinematic signatures of winds , specifically ca  ii h & k , fe  ii @xmath165018 , the mg  i @xmath665167 , 5172 , 5183 triplet , the na  i  d lines , h@xmath3 , h@xmath67 , h@xmath68 ( h@xmath69 falls in a gap between the orders in our hires setting ) , and the k  i @xmath167699 line (",
    "its doublet partner at 7665    also falls in a gap between orders ) .",
    "the morphology of these lines is illustrated in figure  [ hires - lines ] .",
    "notably , the blueshifted absorption troughs are narrower in our early - stage spectrum of  than exhibited in modern spectra of v1515 cyg and v1057 cyg , by at least a factor of two .",
    "although  exhibited [ o  i ] @xmath166300 emission in the @xcite spectrum , it is not apparent post - outburst , even at high spectral resolution , nor do we see other forbidden species in emission ( such as [ n  ii ] and [ s  ii ] ) typically associated with outflows in ysos .",
    "the other line worth noting in  for its kinematic signatures is li  i @xmath166707 .",
    "figure  [ lispec ] shows the spectral region containing this line , in comparison to v1515 cyg and v1057 cyg as well the g2  i standard .",
    "the li i absorption profile has multiple components including a narrow slightly blueshifted component arising from low - velocity gas and a broader absorption extending to @xmath70  that is reminiscent of the flat - bottomed profiles seen in other metallic lines in the same spectral region .",
    "a similar absorption profile is also seen in ba  ii ( figure  [ hires - lines ] ) .",
    "6706 and ca",
    "i @xmath166717 region of . for comparison",
    "we also show high - resolution spectra of v1057 cyg , v1515 cyg , and a g2  ib spectral standard , all from our unpublished spectral database . in particular ,",
    "notice the strong li absorption present in  and the two canonical fu orionis objects .",
    "the li line in both v1057 cyg and  traces an unusual kinematic structure , possibly similar to that seen in ba  ii ( see figure  [ hires - lines ] . ) , width=321 ]    figure  [ fespec ] illustrates the flat - bottomed nature of many absorption lines in .",
    "the profiles are reminiscent of those illustrated by @xcite for fu ori . when the flat - bottomed lines in  are cross - correlated against a normal g2  i stellar template , the resulting cross - correlation function is broad ( @xmath0120 ) with several different peaks . in some spectral regions a central peak",
    "can be fit by a gaussian of width 30 , and there are two secondary peaks near the full width of the correlation function , each having gaussian width @xmath020 . in other spectral regions , both blue and red , the correlation function has no central peak , but only the double peaks near the limb . to measure the goodness of the cross correlation we adopt the tonry - davis @xmath37 value @xcite , which is a ratio of the power in the cross - correlation peak to a measure of the antisymmetry in the correlation .",
    "large @xmath37 values indicate good cross correlations . using a g2 supergiant as a template ,",
    "the tonry - davis @xmath37 value for  is 46 ( compared to @xmath71 to 15 for v1057 cyg , which shows broadening and flat - bottomed structure similar to  in some lines , and @xmath72 for v1515 cyg , which does not ) .",
    "the cross - correlation results are similar when using v1515 cyg as a template , rather than the g2  i standard . employing v1057 cyg as a template results in a broad and centrally peaked cross - correlation function having width 120130 .    6393 , 6593 , and 6678",
    "have been shifted to the same velocity , while fe  i @xmath166400 is offset by @xmath0300  relative to @xmath166393 .",
    "these lines all exhibit a profile with a `` flat '' bottom similar to those observed in fu orionis @xcite . for clarity , spectra have been smoothed with a savitzky - golay filter , which is similar to a running mean .",
    "the vertical grey line is the same as in figure  [ hires - lines].,width=321 ]      nir spectra of fu orionis variables resemble the spectra of k and m giants / supergiants , in contrast to their earlier spectral type in the optical @xcite .",
    "the most prominent features in the nir spectra of fu orionis stars are the strong absorption bands from co at 2.3 @xmath25 m and the h@xmath4o vibration - rotation bands at 1.38 @xmath25 m and 1.87 @xmath25 m .",
    "these absorption bands are clearly present in the outburst spectrum of ; see figure  [ nir - spec ] , which compares spectra from @xcite of two supergiants ( k5  ib and m5  ib - ii ) and a dwarf ( m0  v ) with .",
    "there are many prominent absorption features seen in the m0  v spectrum , which are muted or absent in  and the two supergiant spectra .",
    "this is indicative of a low surface gravity environment for .",
    "we have attempted to derive a crude nir spectral type for .",
    "in addition to its anomalously strong co features ,  also possesses prominent h@xmath4o absorption in the @xmath35 and @xmath73 bands ; the relative strengths of the @xmath35 and @xmath73-band absorptions are unusual , with  separated from both the dwarf and giant loci for those features ( see , e.g. , figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore attempted to characterize the nir spectral type of  based on the strengths of several @xmath35-band absorption features : mg  i ( 1.51 @xmath25 m ) , k  i ( 1.518 @xmath25 m ) , al  i ( 1.67 @xmath25 m ) , and a blend at 1.70 @xmath25 m .",
    "we compared the strengths of these features to those measured for a suite of dwarf and giant templates by @xcite . while this method is sufficient to derive only a crude nir spectral type for , we find that the source s outburst spectrum most closely resembles that of k7  iii  m2  iii giants ( see figure  [ nir - spec ] for some comparisons ) .",
    "it is important to note that the classification scheme from @xcite does not include supergiants ; thus , we conclude that  has a low surface gravity , but we can not discriminate among luminosity classes i  iii .    while the strength of molecular water absorption is greater than that normally observed in giants , this finding is consistent with observations of other fu orionis stars .",
    "@xcite argue that the unusually strong h@xmath4o absorption seen in fu orionis stars can be explained if water that has condensed onto dust grains in the midplane of the disk becomes vaporized during the heating of the disk associated with an fu orionis eruption .",
    "once this evaporated water is flung vertically out of the disk midplane , it will imprint a strong absorption signature in the nir spectrum .",
    "@xcite show that the equivalent width ( ew ) of co absorption at can be used to identify fu orionis - like stars when compared to the ew of na ( 2.206 and ) and ca ( 2.263 and 2.266 @xmath25 m ) . to compare  to the stars studied by @xcite , we measure the ew of na , ca , and co following the prescription of @xcite with the correction provided by @xcite .",
    "we measure na and ca ews of 1.56 @xmath74 0.05 and 1.07 @xmath74 0.06  , respectively , while the ew of co is 35.6 @xmath74 0.3  .",
    "these uncertainties reflect the statistical errors in our measurements , and likely underestimate the systematic effects associated with these measurements ( e.g. , the precise placement of the continuum ) . nevertheless , the systematic uncertainties are not large enough to alter the general conclusions drawn below .",
    "the co absorption is well in excess of what would be expected for both late - type dwarfs and giants based on the strength of the na and ca absorption ; however , this excess co absorption is consistent with other fu orionis - like stars in the sample of connelley & greene ( see their figure  4 ) .",
    "prominent h and he i @xmath1610830 absorption lines are also visible in the nir spectra ( see figure  [ nir - spec ] )",
    ". however , h and he absorption can not originate in a simple , single - temperature , cool ( late k ",
    "m ) atmosphere .",
    "thus , these lines , though unresolved in our spectra , likely trace an outflow , similar to the balmer series in the optical .",
    "he i @xmath1610830 may be a hot - wind indicator , but high - resolution spectra are needed to confirm this @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the 2010 eruption of  places it within the small family of fu orionis - like stars having observed outbursts .",
    "/  exhibits the defining observable characteristics of the fu orionis class as described by @xcite :    * it exhibited a @xmath2 4 mag increase in its optical light curve ; * it is associated with a star - forming region and shows a bright reflection nebula following its eruption ; * optical spectra of the outburst are consistent with a g - type giant / supergiant ; * during outburst , the balmer lines exhibit strong p cygni profiles , with only h@xmath3 showing an emission component , and absorption extending to about @xmath75200 ; and * the nir spectra during the eruption resemble those of m - type giants / supergiants , with strong absorption seen in the h@xmath4o and co bands .      in the ir , unlike typical m and k - type supergiants ,  shows prominent absorption lines of h i ( br@xmath67 , pa@xmath69 , pa@xmath67 , pa@xmath68 ) and he i 1.083 @xmath25 m . in the optical the h i lines trace an outflow , with clear p cygni absorption profiles observed in our hires spectrum .",
    "our spectral resolution is insufficient to determine whether a similar p cygni profile is observed in the nir ; however , h and he absorption can not originate in an m - giant / supergiant photosphere .",
    "thus , the h and he lines are likely the result of inner - disk region accretion / wind physics",
    ".    stands out among the currently known group of fu orionis - like stars in that there are pre - outburst observations with detections from the optical to the mir , making  the first fu orionis - like star with a well - sampled sed prior to eruption .",
    "this sed shows that  was a class ii yso , which are commonly associated with cttss @xcite .",
    "a pre - outburst optical spectrum reveals a late - type star , k7m0 , with prominent h@xmath3 and h@xmath69 seen in emission , again consistent with a ctts .",
    "multiple epochs of optical imaging prior to the outburst reveal that  exhibited stochastic variability at a level consistent with a ctts .",
    "one of the most important elements in the study of /  is that it is associated with a known , optically revealed and previously studied yso .",
    "the clear identification of  as a ctts prior to eruption solidifies the interpretation of fu ori events as enhanced accretion and outflow likely associated with disk - accretion instabilities @xcite .",
    "this outburst s association with a previously classified ctts source shows that fu ori eruptions are not strictly limited to the most highly embedded class 0/i phases of pre - main sequence evolution .",
    "indeed , the strong winds associated with these events may play an important role in disrupting a yso s circumstellar envelope .",
    "such a disruption is thought to be a key component of the class i / ii transition",
    ".    continued photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of /  will fully elucidate its nature .",
    "as more and more synoptic surveys come online , the rich legacy of ir observations made by several ground- and space - based observatories ( e.g. , 2mass , _ iras _ , _ msx _ , _ spitzer _ , _ akari _ , _ wise _ ) over the past two decades will enable the discovery of additional fu orionis outbursts with well characterized pre - outburst seds .",
    "these discoveries will in turn allow us to determine if the case of  is an outlier or the norm",
    ". a better understanding of whether fu orionis - like eruptions typically occur during the class i or class ii phase of pre - main sequence evolution will allow us to place stronger constraints on the triggering mechanism and occurrence rates for these events .",
