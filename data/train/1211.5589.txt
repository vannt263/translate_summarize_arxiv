    "current and future radio continuum surveys typically probe redshifts out to @xmath1 and often cover a significant fraction of the sky . the large volumes accessible in these surveys provide a probe of the large - scale structure and thus can be utilised to test cosmological models .",
    "one of the most common approaches to investigate the large - scale distribution of cosmological objects is the two - point angular correlation function ( acf ) which quantifies the projected clustering of galaxies on the plane of the sky . to gain information on the three dimensional distribution of galaxies and their evolution with time",
    ", the redshift distribution of the sample needs to be known .",
    "however , in general , redshifts can not be obtained from radio continuum surveys since the spectra do not show emission or absorption line features .",
    "one way to gain redshift information of these radio sources is to match them to their optical counterparts for which the redshifts are known .",
    "first attempts to detect clustering in radio surveys were carried out in the 1970s , but it was only in 1996 @xcite that the first high - significance detection of the clustering was made using the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres ( first ) survey @xcite .",
    "they found that on angular scales that probe large - scale structure , the acf of galaxies detected down to 1  mjy at 1.4 ghz is well - represented by a power - law , with a slope somewhat steeper than that found for typical optical surveys . a number of other studies , e.g @xcite and @xcite also measured clustering of radio sources using the acf in the first survey , in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , @xcite ) and in the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss , @xcite ) .",
    "whilst there was some disagreement about the slope of the correlation function on larger angular scales , later work by @xcite highlighted problems with their earlier results ( associated with over - cleaning of potential sidelobe sources ) and obtained results from all the surveys consistent with @xcite .",
    "in essence , all these studies are confined to the investigation of the projected clustering signal , since many of the sources are too faint in the optical / ir to obtain accurate redshifts",
    ". however , some information on real - space clustering can be inferred , but this relies on estimates of the average redshift distributions of the sources .    during the 1990s",
    ", @xcite developed models to infer the redshift distribution of faint radio sources extrapolating from data at much higher flux densities .",
    "since then , a number of observations have improved our knowledge in this area .",
    "@xcite estimated redshifts of a complete sample of 72 radio galaxies down to 1 mjy in about one square degree ( 65% with spectroscopic redshifts ) . in the combined eis - nvss survey of radio sources ( censors , @xcite ) ,",
    "redshifts were estimated for 150 sources , in a 6 square degree region , with flux densities above 7.2 mjy in nvss ( 63% of them secure spectroscopic redshifts ) .",
    "@xcite studied the optical matches of first sources in the 2df survey @xcite and @xcite studied nvss matches with @xmath2  mag in the 6df survey @xcite . these studies all confirmed the picture that mjy - radio surveys contain a heterogenous population of galaxies that is dominated by agn at higher flux densities and includes significant fractions of fainter star - forming galaxies at lower redshifts .",
    "they also appeared to rule out a large ` spike ' of very low - z objects predicted by some of the dunlop and peacock models .",
    "understanding the nature of the sources in the radio surveys contributes to our knowledge of the @xmath3 of the sources i.e. the clustering strength of the sources relative to clustering strength of the underlying dark matter . knowing the bias is essential for using clustering as a cosmological probe as it enters into measurements of autocorrelations , the integrated - sachs wolf ( isw ) effect and the lensing effect .",
    "however , little is known about the bias of radio sources .",
    "@xcite presented estimates of the bias based on the first sources . since then , different and sometimes contradictory prescriptions for the bias of radio sources have been used ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite utilised a semi - empirical approach with a bias prescription based on the work of @xcite to predict the clustering of radio sources in future radio surveys .",
    "the bias value in these models is artificially kept from rising to `` non - physical '' levels which underscores the lack of understanding of the bias of radio sources .",
    "future radio surveys carried out by the square kilometre array ( ska ) will potentially reach 1 njy , providing catalogs of sources over 3@xmath4 of the sky .",
    "ska pathfinders such as the low frequency array ( lofar ) , the australian square kilometre array pathfinder ( askap ) , the south african karoo array telescope ( meerkat ) , the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) using the apertif instrument and the extended very large array ( evla ) will soon provide surveys with unprecedented depth and/or sensitivity . the resulting radio auto - correlations and cross - correlations with other datasets such as the cmb can provide valuable tests of cosmology .",
    "they can shed light on the question of non - gaussian initial conditions in the universe @xcite and on issues concerning dark energy via the isw effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". they may also provide strong tests of modified gravity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and be used as direct probe of dark matter through gravitational lensing effects ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is essential for these studies to have a good understanding of the underlying bias of radio galaxies . in recent studies , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , predictions for future constraints on cosmology have been made by marginalizing over a single bias parameter but this does not capture the uncertainties in the evolution of bias which could be very important for the interpretation of measurements .",
    "therefore , in this article we attempt to make a direct measurement of the bias of first radio sources at intermediate redshifts .",
    "we match first sources to galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss - dr7 , e.g. @xcite ) and determine the redshift distribution of the matched sources .",
    "we then create a catalog of unmatched sources to probe the higher - z population .",
    "the format of the paper is as follows . in   [ sec : data ] we discuss the data and our methodology ; in   [ sec : results ] we discuss the results and present an estimate of the bias of radio sources at high redshift . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : con ] present our conclusions .",
    "our approach to isolating a high - z sample of first sources and estimating its redshift distribution can be summarised in the following steps :    1 .",
    "match the first sources to galaxies from the sdss survey and establish the redshift distribution of the matches from an sdss photometric redshift catalogue 2 .",
    "use the s@xmath0 simulations @xcite to estimate an average redshift distribution for all first sources .",
    "3 .   estimate the redshift distribution of unmatched sources by removing the matched distribution from the distribution of all sources .",
    "it is then inferred that the unmatched sources are mostly at higher redshifts .",
    "4 .   the angular clustering of the high - z sample",
    "can then be measured and compared with what is expected for dark matter sampling the same redshift range , to obtain an estimate of the bias .        in this section",
    "we describe the sample selection of the radio sources .",
    "table  [ table : collapsing ] summarises our selection criteria quoted below .",
    "the first survey mapped a region of the sky covering 10,000  @xmath5 in the northern galactic cap at 1.4 ghz down to 1.4 mjy .",
    "the final catalogue contained a total of 816,331  sources with a completeness of 95% down the lower flux level used of 2 mjy .",
    "creating our sample of first sources to be matched to sdss required various steps to minimise potential sources of contamination . in the first step , we removed objects with a high probability of being a sidelobe .",
    "the first survey has assigned to each source a probability of being a sidelobe ranging from 0 ( indicating an object is not a sidelobe ) to 1.0 ( indicating an object is a sidelobe ) . to reduce this source of contamination",
    ", we explored various sidelobe probability values on our initial clustering analysis .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in ",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "however , we note that for our final selection we found a sidelobe probability value of 0.7 led to results the had minimal effects from the presents for sidelobes or the over - cleaning of them . for a sidelobe probability of 0.7",
    "we were left with 795,453 sources .",
    "the next step required the collapsing of multiple components ( e.g. double lobes ) to a single source .",
    "following @xcite we chose a collapsing radius of 72 \" .",
    "this is the linking length of the friends - of - friends algorithm the we use to generate the groups of sources .",
    "we found that the average collapsed group had 2 to 3 components and a few groups that had up to 20 components . to compute the flux for each collapsed source",
    ", the integrated flux of each component was added together .",
    "the flux - weighted average positions were then calculated and used to match with the sdss .",
    "this collapsing radius reduced the sample to 647,985 sources .",

    "the sdss has mapped a quarter of the entire sky with unprecedented accuracy using multi - band photometry ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) from the 2.5-meter telescope on apache point to a limiting magnitude of @xmath12 .",
    "the second phase of the project is now complete and is ideally suited to our studies as it is fully contained within the first survey area .",
    "the number density of sdss - dr7 photometric sources is orders of magnitudes greater than the density of 2 mjy first sources .",
    "the average size of sdss galaxies is between 2 `` and 5s . to avoid erroneous matches we have chosen a relatively conservative matching radius of 2 '' to match our first sample to the sdss - dr7 photometric catalogue . to ensure accurate matches we only consider objects classified by the sdss pipeline as a galaxy , requiring that they are successfully deblended to obtain precise positions , and have reliable photometric measurements in all 5 sdss filters .",
    "redshifts for the matched sdss galaxies are taken from @xcite .",
    "specifically , we use the photometric redshift estimated from a neural network method inferred from the 4 galaxy colours and 3 concentration indices .",
    "this estimate is recommended for faint ( @xmath13 ) galaxies , which dominate the matched galaxy sample .",
    "finally , we apply a minimum redshift cut of @xmath14 to remove contamination from misidentified stars .",
    "it should also be noted that we are likely to miss some of the optical identifications of fairly nearby multi - component radio sources as the collapsed source position may not give the position of the optical counterpart accurately enough . these sources are included in the redshift distribution of the simulations ( but not in the matched redshift distribution ) and thus will be included correctly in the unmatched redshift distribution .",
    "our method for probing the average bias of the unmatched sample is thus still valid , but this effect could make the interpretation of the average bias more complicated .",
    "thus , for our central analysis we use four samples : 45,883 first matched galaxies , 173,177 first unmatched galaxies with fluxes greater than 2 mjy , and similarly 15,842 matched ( 77,360 unmatched ) galaxies with fluxes greater than 7 mjy .",
    "we probe the evolution of the bias in the matched sample by considering three redshift bins corresponding to @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which were chosen such that each bin contains approximately the same number of galaxies ( see table  [ table : matching ] for a summary ) .",

    "a prescription for clustering that captures the clustering pattern on large scales ( larger than those where non - linear evolution of density fluctuations becomes important ) was used .",

    "this is expected since the matched sample occupies lower redshift ranges ( cf . ,",
    "[ fig : dndz ] ) , thus a given angle corresponds to smaller physical scales where there is more clustering .",
    "the acf for the full 1  mjy sample found by @xcite lies between our matched and unmatched curves .",
    "the amount of clustering measured in both the matched and unmatched samples at angles greater than @xmath58 is difficult to explain when one considers the results in figure  [ fig : dm_pred ] . on these scales",
    ", one would expect to probe @xmath60 where the sample contains many fainter star - forming galaxies with a bias similar to normal galaxies i.e. @xmath61 .",
    "instead , we see a bias @xmath62 for the unmatched and values @xmath63 for the matched sample .    to explore the possibility that large angle fluctuations are due to systematic variations in source density associated with different observing epochs , we plot fractional number density variation as a function of declination in the left panel of figure  [ fig : decstrips ] and note some fairly large changes in the fractional number density . to investigate the impact of this on the correlation function measurements , we divide the first sources into declination strips roughly associated with different observing epochs and",
    "calculate the acf in each strip .",
    "the results shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : decstrips ] indicate that , beyond @xmath58 , the results in the different declination strips start to differ .",
    "this suggests that systematics might have a significant effect on larger scales .",
    "however , we note that on smaller scales the measurements are consistent with each other , indicating that these scales are free of systematics related to this effect .",
    "we discuss other possible explanations for the excess large scale - power seen in the full sample in section 3.2 .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig:2pcf ] shows the acf for the 7mjy sample , which should be completely dominated by agn @xcite .",
    "the clustering of the matched sample is consistent with that of the 2mjy matched sample . in the unmatched sample , the bias is higher at large angles .",
    "the low measurements at smaller angles may indicate that the sidelobe over - cleaning problem is more pronounced for brighter sources .    to help interpret the matched acf",
    ", we split the 2 mjy matched sample into three redshift slices , keeping the number of sources in each slice approximately constant . in the left panel of figure  [ fig:2pcf_zslice ]",
    ", we plot the acf for each of the redshift slices and in the right - hand panel we plot the bias calculated as a function of angle for each slice .",
    "one sees that the bias for the lowest redshift slice is fairly close to @xmath64 , as one would expect for a population dominated by fairly ordinary star - forming galaxies .",
    "sources in the highest redshift bin are much more biased , as one would expect for a population dominated by agn that trace large halo masses in the universe . the important point",
    "to note is that according to figure  [ fig : dm_pred ] the average redshift probed for the matched sample at larger angles is about @xmath65 , but we see a large bias for the matched sample , left panel in figure  [ fig:2pcf ] , at these angles and this can be attributed to the more highly biased population at @xmath66 .         given that our main aim in this work is to constrain the bias toward high redshifts , we choose an angle of @xmath67 to determine the clustering behaviour of the high redshift radio sources . according to figure  [ fig : dm_pred ] this choice allows us to probe bias at @xmath68 .",
    "we find that the unmatched sources are more biased than the matched sample ( at @xmath69 ) , with a value of @xmath70 , compared to @xmath71 for the matched sample at a mean redshift of @xmath72 .",

[ cols=\"<,<,^ , < , < \" , ]      in this paper , our results are based on measurements at angles smaller than @xmath58 but it is interesting to consider explanations for the excess power at larger angles in the @xmath74 sample .    1 .   following the discussion for the matched sample , we could reason that , a highly biased population at high redshift could contribute significantly to the measurement at @xmath75 , even though figure  [ fig : dm_pred ] indicates that the average redshift probed on large angles is small .",
    "bias of @xmath76 , however , is not seen even for fairly massive clusters and additional contributors should be considered 2 .",
    "systematics other than those discussed in section 3.1 could also contribute . the beam shown in @xcite for the nvss survey does not go to zero at large angles , suggesting that bright sources could produce artefacts at large angles due to imperfect cleaning in vla data .",
    "however , similar ` excess power ' is observed in the sumss radio survey which was carried out using a very different kind of telescope @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is a possibility that radio surveys contain spurious sources which are correlated on large angles and this is a possible explanation for the excess power observed in clustering studies .",
    "3 .   there is a low - redshift spike in the source counts , not included in the redshift distribution used for the dark matter predictions .",
    "this would push up the clustering amplitude on all angular scales , but particularly on the larger scales .",
    "however , the similar behaviour of the 2 and 7mjy indicate that the excess power is not due to faint , low - z star - forming galaxies .",
    "also , the results of @xcite and @xcite appear to rule out this explanation .",
    "the s@xmath0 redshift distribution which we use here is designed to fit these observations . a hypothetical low - redshift population which would have been missed in these studies",
    "would need to have @xmath77 and @xmath78 , making such a low - z obscured population an unlikely explanation for much of the excess power in the unmatched sample .",
    "our matching technique is likely to result in some low - z multi - component radio sources being missed in our matched sample and one would expect these sources to be more biased than ordinary galaxies .",
    "this could boost the amplitude of clustering on large scales .",
    "finally , there is the possibility that non - gaussian initial conditions could generate more clustering on large scales than in the standard model as suggested by @xcite .",
    "further work is clearly needed to understand the excess power in the clustering signal on large angles .",
    "we carried out a number of tests to check the robustness of our results . in the first test , we changed the matching radius to 1 \" to decrease the number of false identifications .",
    "this did not impact that acf or the average redshift distribution of the unmatched sample , indicating that the bias measurement at @xmath72 is not sensitive to the choice of matching radius . in the second test , we used the matched sample of @xcite rather than our own matching .",
    "this sample was carefully constructed using both nvss and first and used visual identification rather than an automated `` collapse and match '' approach .",
    "results were consistent with our matched sample , given that their sample probes a somewhat different redshift range to ours . in the third test , we considered the impact of our choice of sidelobe probability cut .",
    "we calculated the acf for several different sidelobe probability samples and found that all samples behaved similarly at large angles .",
    "finally , we investigated the sensitivity of our results to the photometric redshift estimates , by using different sdss photometric redshift catalogues .",
    "we found that the results were robust to the choice of catalogue . .",
    "we have introduced a method for measuring the bias at high redshift for a sample of radio continuum sources lacking redshift information . by matching radio sources from the first survey data to their optical counterparts in the sdss survey",
    ", we extracted a subsample of unmatched objects .",
    "we then used the s@xmath0 simulation to infer an average redshift distribution for all first sources and estimate the redshift distribution of unmatched sources by subtracting the matched distribution from the distribution of all sources .",
    "we have found that the surprisingly large clustering signal at large angular scales present in the full first sample is also detected in the unmatched sample considered here , and to some extent , in the matched samples at high redshift .",
    "we note that this could be due to systematic fluctuations in sensitivity in different observing epochs but also discuss a number of other possible explanations . using",
    "clustering measurements at smaller angles , we estimate the bias of the unmatched first sources with flux densities over 2 mjy , at @xmath68 , to be @xmath79",

    "<S> the relationship between the clustering of dark matter and that of luminous matter is often described using the bias parameter . here , we provide a new method to probe the bias of intermediate to high - redshift radio continuum sources for which no redshift information is available . </S>",
    "<S> we matched radio sources from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimetres ( first ) survey data to their optical counterparts in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to obtain photometric redshifts for the matched radio sources . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the publicly available semi - empirical simulation of extragalactic radio continuum sources ( s@xmath0 ) to infer the redshift distribution for all first sources and estimate the redshift distribution of unmatched sources by subtracting the matched distribution from the distribution of all sources . </S>",
    "<S> we infer that the majority of unmatched sources are at higher redshifts than the optically matched sources and demonstrate how the angular scales of the angular two - point correlation function can be used to probe different redshift ranges . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the angular clustering of radio sources with that expected for dark matter and estimate the bias of different samples .    </S>",
