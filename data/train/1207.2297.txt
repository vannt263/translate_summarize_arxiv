    "one of the most fascinating aspects of nuclear structure is the existence of competing modes of collective motion , with phase transitions linking them .",
    "this has been discussed extensively within the context of the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite , with the vertices of the casten triangle representing extreme modes of collective motion in the ground state @xcite",
    ".    there has been much effort to develop theories that are able to describe the competing modes of nuclear collectivity and the associated transitions from one to another .",
    "this is a major theme of the ongoing effort to develop a unified density functional theory of atomic nuclei .",
    "it has also been a major theme of the phenomenological ibm , which has recently seen a significant microscopic advance through the development of a mapping procedure that translates the physics of density functionals to the ibm parameters in the various collective regions @xcite .",
    "a model that is closely linked in spirit to the ibm is the nucleon - pair approximation ( npa ) of the shell model ( often called the nucleon - pair shell model in the literature ) @xcite . like the ibm , the npa is based on a truncation in terms of pair degrees of freedom . unlike the ibm , however , the microscopic structure of the pairs is preserved throughout .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the npa truncated to the dominant @xmath0 and @xmath1 pair degrees of freedom is able to qualitatively reproduce all of the phase transitions of the ibm , including the transition from vibrational u(5 ) behavior to axially symmetric su(3 ) rotational behavior @xcite .",
    "these studies were of a model nature , however , not making contact with real nuclear systems .    in this work",
    ", we return to the issue of whether the npa is able to describe the shape transition from vibrational to rotational behavior in real nuclei .",
    "we carry out the analysis for the even-@xmath2 ce isotopes from @xmath3ce through @xmath4ce , where such a shape transition has been observed experimentally .",
    "we find that when we use the traditional approach for generating the dominant collective pairs of the model , we can not reproduce the shape transition .",
    "we then suggest the use of an alternative approach to the structure of these pairs for rotational nuclei that incorporates more of the physics that builds their correlations . with this new approach to the structure of the collective pairs in the rotational region ,",
    "we are able to achieve the observed shape transition .",
    "the structure of this article is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ npa ] , we briefly review the basic ingredients of the npa , including a discussion of the traditional approach for defining the structure of the collective pairs to be used when applying the method . in sec .",
    "[ hfb ] , we describe the alternative formalism for building the collective pairs appropriate to deformed nuclei . in sec .",
    "[ ham ] , we discuss other input to our calculations for the even - mass ce isotopes , for which the results are presented in sec . [ res ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sum ] we summarize the key conclusions of the work and outline some issues for future consideration .",
    "the nucleon - pair approximation of the shell model ( npa ) is a truncation strategy for the nuclear shell model based on the dominance of a few selected coherent pair configurations .",
    "when viewed as a microscopic realization of the ibm , the selected nucleon pairs are the lowest spin - zero and spin - two pairs for neutrons and protons , called @xmath0 and @xmath1 pairs , respectively .",
    "the npa does not map these collective pairs onto bosons , however , working in terms of the collective pair configurations directly .",
    "furthermore , the npa does not restrict the collective pairs that are included to the lowest spin - zero and spin - two pair configurations for neutrons and protons only , permitting in principle other pair configurations to be included .",
    "the npa traces back to the generalized seniority scheme @xcite and the broken pair approximation ( bpa ) @xcite .",
    "these methods could not be used as a practical and general truncation strategy for the shell model , however , until the development by chen @xcite in 1997 of a set of recursive formulae that enabled the calculation of the matrix elements of _ realistic _ nuclear hamiltonian in a basis built up in terms of these collective pairs .",
    "we italicize the term _ realistic _ because of the computational limitation to date of the methodology to hamiltonians involving multipole pairing interactions in the like - nucleon channels and separable multipole - multipole interactions in the neutron - proton channel . with such assumed semi - realistic hamiltonians and codes based on the chen s recursion formulae , it is now possible to treat systems involving several pairs of each type of particle and several collective pair degrees of freedom .",
    "there are several key steps in the npa strategy .",
    "one involves a choice of the effective shell - model hamiltonian , along the lines just discussed .",
    "the second involves an assumption of the pair degrees of freedom to be included , as dictated by the physics of the problem under discussion and computational limitations .",
    "another key ingredient is the assumed structure of the collective pairs that are retained .",
    "the standard approach has been to obtain the lowest @xmath0 pair from a number - conserving bcs treatment , or equivalently a variational description in terms of states with generalized seniority zero , for neutrons and protons , respectively .",
    "the prescription typically used for the lowest excited pairs is a variational treatment of these pairs in terms of generalized seniority - two states , using the @xmath0 pairs already determined .",
    "an alternative approach sometimes used for the structure of the @xmath1 pair is to generate it from the commutator of the quadrupole operator with the @xmath0 pair .",
    "the traditional prescription is reasonable for systems that are meaningfully described by the generalized seniority or broken pair scheme , namely for either semi - magic or near semi - magic nuclei .",
    "once there are a large enough number of both types of particles , however , the expectation is that generalized seniority ceases to provide a useful description of the states of the system . in such cases , an alternative to the traditional approach for choosing the dominant collective pairs",
    "must be sought .",
    "indeed , such considerations have led to the difficulties that have persisted for many years in microscopically deriving the ibm for all but spherical @xmath5-like nuclei , at least until the recent work in which the collective surface emerging from density functional treatments is mapped directly into a boson space , with no direct consideration of the internal structure of the collective pairs @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we discuss how to build more appropriately the dominant collective pairs for our study of the shape transition from vibrational to deformed nuclei using the npa , and then in the results that follow in section iv we show that the choice of this new strategy for building the collective pairs , a strategy borrowed from an earlier effort to build the relevant collective pairs in deformed nuclei , is critical to obtain a meaningful description of the shape transition from vibrational to deformed nuclei in the region we study , namely the even - mass ce isotopes .",
    "as we will see in next section , it is critical to use collective pairs that are tuned to the dynamics of the collective region under investigation . in the vibrational region ,",
    "the traditional pairs that have been used in the npa are most likely appropriate as they follow from the dynamics of generalized seniority . in deformed nuclei , however , such pairs do not incorporate any effects of the proton - neutron interaction .",
    "thus , we propose to use a prescription first discussed by pittel and dukelsky @xcite in the context of the microscopic ibm for deformed nuclei .",
    "their prescription derives from the use of hartree - fock - bogolyubov ( hfb ) approximation to variationally generate an optimum intrinsic pair , from which pairs of definite angular momentum can then be projected .",
    "similar considerations to obtain coherent @xmath6 nucleon pairs appropriate to the npa calculations based on the field approximation were studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we begin the procedure by carrying out an axially - symmetric hfb calculation in the same space and with the same hamiltonian that is used in the npa study .",
    "once the hfb calculations have been carried out , we then transform to the canonical basis , namely the basis in which the density matrix @xmath7 for particles of type @xmath8 or @xmath9 and projection @xmath10 , is diagonal . letting @xmath11 denote the operator that creates a nucleon of type @xmath12 in orbit @xmath13 , we can express the single - particle creation operators in the canonical basis by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the matrix that transforms the density matrix to diagonal form for projection @xmath10 and particle type @xmath12 .",
    "the intrinsic hfb wave function in the canonical basis can be expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a coherent pair creation operator and @xmath18 denotes the doubly - magic core .",
    "the quantities entering ( [ gamma ] ) can be obtained directly from the diagonal elements of the density matrix , viz : @xmath19^{1/2 } ~,\\nonumber \\\\ u^{(\\tau)}_{\\alpha m } & = & \\left [ 1- ( v^{(\\tau)}_{\\alpha m})^2 \\right]^{1/2 } ~ , \\nonumber \\\\ d_{\\tau } & = & \\left ( \\sum_{\\alpha m>0 } \\left[v^{(\\tau)}_{\\alpha m}/u^{(\\tau)}_{\\alpha m } \\right]^2 \\right)^{-1/2 }   ~.    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the correlated pair creation operators @xmath20 contain components with all allowed even angular momenta , @xmath21 the square of the amplitude @xmath22 determines the importance of the correlated pair of type @xmath12 with angular momentum @xmath23 in the intrinsic wave function and is given by @xmath24 \\right)^{1/2 } ~ , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we treat the even - mass ce isotopes by assuming a @xmath27 , @xmath28 doubly - magic core and distributing the remaining protons over the orbits of the @xmath29 major shell and the remaining neutrons over the orbits of the @xmath30 major shell .",
    "the hamiltonian , as dictated by the computational structure of the npa code , takes the form @xmath31 it includes a single - particle energy term and a two - body interaction consisting of multipole pairing interactions in the @xmath32 and @xmath33 channels and a separable quadrupole - quadrupole interaction in the @xmath34 channel .",
    ".single - particle energies ( in mev ) used in the calculations for the ce isotopes described in the text .",
    "they are based on low - lying energy levels of @xmath35sb and @xmath35sn . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ de ] , we show the deformation energies @xmath36 that derive from our hfb calculations of these nuclei . as expected , the deformation energy grows gradually with increasing neutron number , with the gain in energy reaching a value of @xmath37  mev in @xmath4ce .",
    "this is not as large a deformation energy as we would have liked to have seen for a well - deformed nucleus , perhaps reflecting the fact that our model space does not include all the orbits that could contribute meaningfully .",
    "nevertheless , the results are suggestive that the hfb calculations are producing the observed shape transition .    in fig .",
    "[ al ] , we present the calculated hfb results for @xmath38 for these isotopes , illustrating the gradually increasing importance of @xmath39 pairs in the ground band as the deformation grows . by the time we reach @xmath4ce , @xmath1 pairs contribute to the intrinsic state of the ground band as much as @xmath0 pairs .    .",
    "]    next we present the results of our calculations using the npa . in all calculations our model space includes the lowest @xmath0 pair , the lowest @xmath1 pair and the lowest @xmath40 pair ( with spin four ) , both for neutrons and protons .",
    "however , because of computational considerations we only permit a single @xmath40 pair for each type of particle .",
    "[ spe ] shows several sets of calculated results in comparison with the experimental data .",
    "the spectra denoted  bpa \" are based on the use of the traditional broken pair approximation ( bpa ) prescription for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath40 pairs , as described in section ii .",
    "the spectra denoted  hfb \" are based on the use of pairs obtained from axially - symmetric hfb calculations , as described in sec .",
    "the spectra denoted  com \" include the @xmath0 and @xmath1 pairs from the two prescriptions in the same calculation , with their nonorthogonality taken into account .",
    "we return later to our reason for including the latter results .",
    "results are shown up to @xmath41 mev in excitation energy , both for the experimental and calculated spectra .",
    "there are several clear messages that emerge from these results .",
    "first , the traditional broken pair approximation ( bpa ) results are unable to describe the shape transition from vibrational to rotational as we proceed through the ce chain .",
    "this is not surprising , considering our earlier motivating remarks .",
    "the hfb results , in contrast , do give rise to a clear shape transition .",
    "though @xmath3ce does not exhibit a rotational pattern , the addition of just two neutrons leads to a fairly robust rotational spectrum , which becomes even more pronounced with the addition of further neutrons .    ] emerging from the three sets of calculations with the corresponding experimental data .",
    "panels ( a - d ) have the same meaning as in fig .",
    "3 . , scaledwidth=35.0% ]    these conclusions are made even more striking when we show the energies of the associated gamma rays emerging from the two sets of calculations , which are given in fig .",
    "the hfb results show a rapid emergence of a deformed pattern ( roughly parallel lines ) with increasing neutron number , whereas none is seen in the bpa spectra .",
    "interestingly , the bpa results do not even give a good description of @xmath42ce , with only four valence neutrons . the excitation energy it predicts for the lowest @xmath43 state",
    "is significantly larger than that seen experimentally .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the hfb results , which already gets a fairly good description of the lowest @xmath43 excitation energy in @xmath42ce .    while we have focussed on energy spectra in figs .",
    "[ spe ] and [ ray ] , and in the discussion that followed , we can get a clearer picture of why it is important to use dynamically - determined collective pairs by looking at the absolute binding energies of the ground states that emerge in these calculations with respect to the @xmath44sn core .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "when we use the broken pair approximation prescription for the collective pairs of the model we obtain much less binding than with the hfb pairs , which include effects of the proton - neutron interaction in their structure .",
    "while this is especially true for the most well - deformed nuclei , it is also true , albeit to a much less extent , in @xmath3ce , where the use of hfb collective pairs produces roughly @xmath45  mev in additional binding .",
    "while the method is able to produce a shape transition from vibrational to rotational nuclei , it produces it much too rapidly . as is evident both from fig .",
    "[ spe ] and even more so from fig .",
    "[ ray ] , the model already produces a fairly well - deformed spectrum for @xmath42ce , which according to table [ r ] is clearly transitional .",
    "it is not too surprising that we are unable to adequately describe transitional nuclei , since our axially - symmetric hfb solution is not very meaningful for those nuclei .",
    "the fairly small hfb deformation energy for those nuclei , as seen in the fig . [ de ] , suggests that the hfb solution is not stable against zero - point fluctuations .",
    "one possible thought is that we might include more than one pair for each angular momentum in this region . as a first step in this direction ,",
    "we have carried out calculations in which we include both the hfb pairs and the bpa pairs , taking into account their nonorthogonality , to see whether this improves our description of the transitional region .",
    "those are the results denoted  com \" in both figs .",
    "[ spe ] and [ ray ] .",
    "the inclusion of a second @xmath0 and @xmath1 pair for each type of nucleon improves the description substantially , giving a better reproduction of the properties of all nuclei considered .",
    "it markedly improves upon the hfb results for @xmath3ce , placing the @xmath46 state much closer to its experimental location .",
    "however , as is evident from fig . [ ray ] , the shape transition is still too rapid .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the idea of including more than one pair with each angular momentum is a possible approach for future consideration , as it can be readily included in the analysis , but further thought as to which pairs to include , especially in the transitional region , is needed .",
    "it is also interesting to note that even in the most deformed nucleus considered , @xmath4ce , the moment of inertia that derives from the best npa calculations , those denoted  com \" , is still too small and the spectrum is accordingly too spread - out .",
    "interestingly the same result emerged in the first efforts to microscopically derive the ibm in deformed nuclei by mapping the fermionic density functional onto a corresponding one in the boson space .",
    "recently it was shown that it is necessary to add a further term to the ibm hamiltonian of the form @xmath47 to better reproduce the moment of inertia of the rotational systems that were studied in ref .",
    "the npa seems to also have need for an additional contribution to the rotational moment of inertia , which perhaps has a similar origin .",
    "it is not clear at this time , however , how to incorporate it in the npa formalism .",
    "in this paper , we have addressed the issue of whether or not the npa is able to describe the transition from vibrational to rotational nuclei in real nuclear systems .",
    "we focus on the even - mass ce isotopes , in which such a shape transition is known to occur experimentally .",
    "we see that with the use of the traditional collective pairs that have been used in previous applications of the model , namely pairs derived from the broken pair or generalized seniority approaches , the model is not able to describe such a shape transition .",
    "such pairs leave out important effects of the proton - neutron interaction and thus are not suitable in a truncated description of collective nuclei with active neutrons _ and _ protons .",
    "in contrast , a description that uses collective pairs from the hfb approximation does contain the requisite correlation effects and is able to produce the observed shape transition . on the other hand ,",
    "the shape transition produced is too sharp , reflecting the fact that the correlated pairs produced in the hfb calculations are not adequate for the transitional region .",
    "furthermore , the moments of inertia are not very well reproduced .",
    "the difficulty in obtaining appropriate collective pairs to use in the npa in the various nuclear regions is reminiscent of the same difficulty that arose in early efforts to microscopically derive the ibm for these different regions .",
    "it is only with the recent development of methods that map the collective surface _",
    "directly _ onto an associated ibm collective surface that it has been possible to consistently obtain a microscopic derivation of the ibm . in the absence of an analogous procedure for the npa ,",
    "we have suggested the possibility of using several collective pairs in those regions in which a single hfb pair for each angular momentum is not sufficient .",
    "further work to identify how to optimally obtain those pairs in transitional regions is still needed .",
    "likewise , we have seen that the moment of inertia that results from our best calculation for well deformed nuclei is too small and further work is needed to find a way to increase the rotational moment of inertia in the npa framework .    *",
