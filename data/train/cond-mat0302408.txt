    "the generating function method was used for random one - dimensional chains  @xcite , particularly for the sinai problem  @xcite .",
    "explicit expressions for the mfpt , in terms of the basic jump probabilities for discrete time random walk with a reflecting boundary were obtained independently by van den broeck  @xcite , le doussal  @xcite , and murthy and kehr  @xcite by different methods .",

    "finally , in section  [ sec : fin ] , we briefly summarize the principal results of our study .",
    "we start considering a random walk on a discrete one - dimensional lattice with nearest neighbor hopping ; jumping from site @xmath0 to site @xmath1 with transition probability @xmath2 , or to site @xmath3 with transition probability @xmath4 . in this manner",

    "the second is the probability , @xmath14 , of finding the particle within the domain @xmath12 at time @xmath8 , given that it initially was at site @xmath0 ( not necessary in @xmath12 ) .",
    "the dynamical evolution of both quantities follows from the backward master equation  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 the survival probability is the solution of the equation  ( [ eqft ] ) with the initial condition @xmath17 , for all @xmath13 , considering the boundary conditions @xmath18 , for all @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",

    "finally , mfpt and mrt can be obtained from the asymptotic limit of the laplace transformed ( denoted by hats ) survival and residence probabilities , respectively  @xcite , @xmath23      in the first - passage time problem the random walker only jumps inside a finite interval with absorbing ends , as shown in figure  [ fpt - fig ] .",
