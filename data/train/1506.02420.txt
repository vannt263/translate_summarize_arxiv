    "wireless energy transfer ( wet ) is a promising energy harvesting technology where the destination node harvests energy from electromagnetic radiations instead of traditional wired energy sources  @xcite .",
    "the use of wet can help increase the battery - lifetime of energy - constrained wireless sensor nodes ( wsns ) that are used for applications such as intelligent transportation , intrusion detection , and aircraft structural monitoring  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , wet can be used to charge low power devices such as temperature and humidity meters and liquid crystal displays  @xcite .",
    "even low - end computation , sensing , and communication can be performed by harvesting energy from ambient radio frequency ( rf ) signals including tv , cellular networks , and wi - fi transmissions  @xcite .",
    "however , there are several challenges that must be addressed in order to implement wet .",
    "firstly , only a small fraction of the energy radiated by an energy transmitter can be harvested by the wsn which severely limits the range of wet  @xcite .",
    "secondly , the received power levels that are suitable for wireless information transfer are not suitable for energy transfer , where the absolute received power is of interest and not the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "massive multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) systems , where the base station ( bs ) uses antenna arrays equipped with a few hundred antennas , have recently emerged as a leading @xmath0 g wireless communications technology that offer orders of magnitude better data rates and energy efficiency than current wireless systems  @xcite .",
    "potentially , the use of massive arrays could significantly boost the performance of wet as well .",
    "we consider a scenario where a multi - antenna bs communicates with and transfers rf power to a wsn .",
    "the motivation of using an array of antennas is that the bs can exploit an array gain , resulting from coherent combination of the signals transmitted from each antenna , if it knows the channel response .",
    "this array gain in turn may increase the operating range and/or decrease the amount of transmit energy needed to satisfy a given energy harvesting constraint .",
    "the drawback is that the wireless channel between the bs and the wsn fluctuates so that the channel state information ( csi ) needs to be acquired on a regular basis to enable coherent combining .",
    "the communication between the array and the sensor takes place in two phases as shown in figure  [ fig : system_model_two_phases ] . in the first phase , the sensor utilizes energy stored in a battery or capacitor to transmit a pilot waveform which is measured at each antenna in the bs array , in order to estimate the channel impulse response from the sensor . in the second phase , the array beamforms energy to the sensor , using the estimated channel responses and exploiting reciprocity of the propagation channel",
    "the energy harvested by the sensor is used to recharge its capacitor or battery , and needed in turn for pilot transmission in phase one of the next round and also to perform the main tasks of the sensor .",
    "in addition , both phases may involve communication of information , although that is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "the main questions asked and answered in this paper are : 1 ) what array gain can the massive mimo setup provide , i.e. , how does the required uplink pilot energy ( and thereby the energy storage requirements at the sensor , and the required array transmit energy ) scale with the number of antennas in the array taking into account that all channel responses are estimated from pilots ?",
    "the goal is to determine the scaling laws for energy transfer using large arrays .",
    "2 ) how does the number of antennas at the bs depend on the path loss or the distance between the bs and the wsn ?",
    "3 ) how do the answers to the previous questions depend on propagation conditions and the correlation between the adjacent antennas ?",
    "4 ) what role does power adaptation based on the estimated csi play in improving the outage performance ?    to this end , we derive new expressions that are valid for any generic path loss model for the probability of outage in energy transfer , defined here as the probability that the energy harvested by the wsn is less than the energy that it spends on uplink pilots plus the processing energy .",
    "we derive expressions for both perfect csi and imperfect csi based on least squares ( ls ) or minimum mean square error ( mmse ) channel estimation and for both rayleigh fading ( without dominant channel components ) and rician fading ( with dominant channel components ) .",
    "we consider not just the scenarios where the downlink array transmit energy is fixed but also those where it is adapted based on the channel conditions .",
    "we present numerical results to quantify the combined effects of path loss , energy spent on uplink pilot signaling , the downlink energy , the processing energy , the energy harvesting efficiency , the rician @xmath1-factor , power adaptation , the correlation between adjacent antennas , and imperfect csi on the probability of outage in energy transfer . to summarize ,",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to estimate the link budget in order to determine the feasibility of a system that performs wet using multi - antenna arrays .",
    "we next discuss the relevant literature on wet using multi - antenna arrays .    .",
    "]      the optimal uplink pilot power and the number of antennas at the sensor that need to be trained so as to maximize the net average harvested energy at the sensor node was characterized in  @xcite .",
    "however , reference  @xcite did not consider the possibility of an outage in energy transfer .",
    "the amount of time that must be allocated for channel estimation and for wet in order to maximize the harvested energy for a multiple input single output ( miso ) system was investigated in  @xcite . in  @xcite , a wireless powered communication network with one multi - antenna bs and a set of single antenna users was studied for joint downlink ( dl ) energy transfer and uplink ( ul ) information transmission via spatial division multiple access .",
    "the aim was to maximize the minimum data throughput among all users by optimizing the dl - ul time allocation , dl energy beamforming , and ul transmit power allocation . while , the optimal training design to maximize the net average harvested energy at the sensor over frequency - selective channels was studied in  @xcite , energy transfer in the downlink to maximize the minimum rate among all users was studied in  @xcite .",
    "simultaneous wireless information and power transfer ( swipt ) , where a multi - antenna bs sends information and energy simultaneously to several users which then perform information decoding or energy harvesting was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the authors in  @xcite investigated when the receiver should switch from the information decoding mode to the energy harvesting mode based on the instantaneous channel and interference conditions so as to achieve various trade - offs between wireless information transfer and energy harvesting .",
    "receiver design for swipt over a point - to - point wireless link was investigated in  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors studied a hybrid network architecture that overlays an uplink cellular network with randomly deployed power beacons for charging the mobile devices wirelessly .",
    "the tradeoffs between the network parameters such as transmission powers and the densities of bss and power beacons were derived under an outage constraint on the data links .",
    "using a stochastic geometry approach , upper bounds on both transmission and power outage probabilities for a downlink swipt system with ambient rf transmitters was developed in  @xcite . energy transfer in relay systems to simultaneously harvest energy and process information",
    "was investigated in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to most existing works in the literature , we focus on ascertaining whether the use of large antenna arrays could substantially extend the feasible range of wet while maintaining the receive power level in the same order such that a reasonable rectenna efficiency can be maintained .    the paper is organized as follows : we present the system model in section  [ sec : system model ] .",

    "the channel realizations are random and they are independent across blocks .",
    "we , therefore , need to estimate the channel after every coherence interval .",
    "we assume tdd mode of communication so that the channel from the bs to the wsn referred to as the downlink channel is the same as the channel from the wsn to the bs referred to as the uplink channel .",
