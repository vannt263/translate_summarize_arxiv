    "fermion masses and mixing have become even more puzzling with the recent discovery of neutrino masses and large leptonic mixing .",
    "one of the approaches often adopted in the search for a possible solution for the flavour puzzle consists of the introduction of family symmetries which constrain the flavour structure of yukawa couplings and lead to predictions for fermion masses and mixings .",
    "harrison , perkins and scott ( hps ) @xcite have pointed out that leptonic mixing at low energies could be described by the so - called tribimaximal mixing matrix , which is a good representation of the present data within @xmath2 .",
    "the special form of this matrix is suggestive of a symmetry related to possible subgroups of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this fact prompted many attempts at finding an underlying symmetry leading to this special pattern of mixing  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are models based on @xmath1 symmetry , which was first introduced  @xcite as a possible family symmetry for the quark sector and is now mostly used for the lepton sector  @xcite . in the leptonic sector ,",
    "neutrino masses are known to be much smaller than the masses of all other fermions and , in addition , leptonic mixing includes large mixing , thus drastically differing from the quark sector .",
    "an elegant explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses is the seesaw mechanism @xcite , which has also the advantage of providing a simple and attractive leptogenesis mechanism for the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe , through the decay of heavy majorana neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , a relationship between low - energy observables and the size of the leptonic asymmetry can only be established in some special cases  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of the viability of leptogenesis in models with leptonic flavour symmetries leading to the hps mixing matrix in the framework of the seesaw mechanism .",
    "our starting point is an effective lagrangian with an @xmath0 symmetry which is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of @xmath4 singlet scalar fields at a scale much higher than the electroweak scale .",
    "the resulting yukawa couplings at this high scale correspond to exact hps mixing with the possibility of majorana - type @xmath5 violation , as well as to exact degeneracy of the heavy majorana neutrinos . in this model ,",
    "leptogenesis becomes viable once the exact degeneracy of the heavy majorana neutrinos is lifted .",
    "we analyze two possible different ways of lifting this degeneracy , either radiatively , when renormalization group effects are taken into account , or through a soft breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry . an interesting feature of our model is the fact that the combination of yukawa couplings appearing in the leptonic @xmath5 asymmetries relevant for flavoured leptogenesis @xcite does not vanish at this high scale .",
    "this is a particular feature of our framework .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present our framework , indicating the flavour symmetry , together with the matter content of the model . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we describe the implications of the flavour symmetry on mixing angles , neutrino mass spectrum and other low - energy observables .",
    "section  [ sec4 ] deals with leptogenesis where we describe two mechanisms to obtain viable leptogenesis in our framework , namely through radiative leptogenesis and through soft breaking of the family symmetry .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "we work in the framework of an extension of the standard model ( sm ) , consisting of the addition of three right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the scalar sector , apart from the usual sm higgs doublet @xmath6 , is extended through the introduction of four types of heavy scalar fields , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , that are singlets under @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , we impose an @xmath0 symmetry to the lagrangian . as is well known , @xmath1 is a discrete symmetry corresponding to the even permutation of four objects having four irreducible representations : three inequivalent one - dimensional representations ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) and a three - dimensional representation ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the following multiplication rules hold : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 . therefore , the product of two triplets , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , yields    .[reps ] representations of the fields under @xmath0 and @xmath22 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us now analyze the viability of leptogenesis and its possible connection with low - energy neutrino observables .",
    "we start by evaluating the dirac neutrino yukawa coupling matrix @xmath23 in the basis where the charged leptons and heavy majorana neutrinos are real and diagonal . in this case , @xmath23 defined in eq .",
    "( [ matrixy ] ) becomes @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the phase of the matrix element @xmath26 .",
    "the matrix @xmath27 now becomes complex : @xmath28 therefore , a crucial difference from the radiative leptogenesis case studied in the previous section is the possibility of having unflavoured leptogenesis . to illustrate its main features , in what follows",
    "we restrict our discussion to the resonantly enhanced @xmath5 asymmetries given in eq .",
    "( [ resonantcp2 ] ) , provided that the condition ( [ resonantdelta ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this will also allow us to estimate the maximal value of the leptonic asymmetries that can be reached in the present framework .    for small values of @xmath29 , the resonant condition given by eq .",
    "( [ resonantdelta ] ) , together with the definition of the mass splitting @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ deltanij ] ) and the matrix @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ mrinv ] ) , imply the relation @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ figure12 ] we present the contours of constant @xmath33 in the @xmath34 plane for @xmath35 and close to @xmath36 ( or to @xmath37 ) .",
    "the contour line @xmath38  gev sets the transition from unflavoured to flavoured leptogenesis , while @xmath39  gev corresponds to the temperature below which the three charged - lepton flavours are distinguishable .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , when @xmath35 there is a large parameter region where unflavoured resonant leptogenesis could be viable . on the other hand ,",
    "a resonantly enhanced flavoured leptogenesis would in general require the soft - breaking parameter @xmath29 to be very small or the fine - tuned relation @xmath40 to be satisfied . as @xmath41 tends to @xmath36 ( or @xmath37 ) the unflavoured leptogenesis region shrinks , while the flavoured leptogenesis one shifts to higher values of @xmath29 .",
    "there is in each case an upper bound on the heavy majorana neutrino mass : @xmath42  gev for @xmath35 and @xmath43  gev for @xmath44 ( or @xmath37 ) .    denoting @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) ,",
    "the unflavoured @xmath5 asymmetry is given in this case by @xmath47 and attains its maximal value @xmath48 when neutrinos are hierarchical .",
    "for the @xmath49-flavoured @xmath5 asymmetry we find : @xmath50 which has the maximal value @xmath51 . the @xmath52- and @xmath53-flavoured asymmetries are given by @xmath54\\ , , \\end{split}\\ ] ] which , clearly , are not suppressed by the soft - breaking parameter @xmath29 and can reach values up to @xmath55 for hierarchical neutrinos .",
    "( color online ) .",
    "the correlation between the mixing matrix element @xmath56 and the unflavoured leptonic asymmetry @xmath57 for @xmath58 and different values of the soft - breaking values @xmath29.,width=283 ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ figure13 ] we present the correlation between the low - energy observable @xmath56 and the absolute value of the unflavoured leptonic asymmetry @xmath59 for different values @xmath29 .",
    "the curves are shown for @xmath58 , which yields the maximal asymmetry [ cf .",
    "( [ unflavorcpasym ] ) ] .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , in the region of phenomenological interest ( @xmath60 ) a variation of the soft - breaking parameter @xmath29 simply implies a rescaling of the curves , once both quantities , @xmath56 and @xmath59 , are proportional to @xmath29 in this region .",
    "recently , models based on discrete flavour symmetries  @xcite have attracted much attention due to the possibility of finding implementations that lead to the hps mixing matrix in leading order .",
    "the implications of these symmetries for leptogenesis depend on the specific details of the model . among these models ,",
    "those based on type - i seesaw realizations have in general the common prediction of vanishing leptonic @xmath5 asymmetries , since the combination @xmath61 , relevant for leptogenesis , is proportional to the unit matrix .",
    "thus , higher dimensional operators , suppressed by additional powers of the cutoff scale @xmath62 are usually required to allow for leptogenesis in these models  @xcite .",
    "we have presented an explicit example , based on the @xmath1 symmetry , where the above limitations can be overcome .",
    "the model is based on an effective theory with an @xmath0 symmetry , which is spontaneously broken at a high scale , leading to exact tribimaximal leptonic mixing in leading order .",
    "a particular feature of the model is the degeneracy of the heavy majorana neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "therefore , for leptogenesis to become viable this degeneracy must be lifted .",
    "this can be easily achieved either by renormalization group effects or by a soft breaking of the @xmath1 symmetry , which then naturally leads to a viable resonant leptogenesis mechanism .",
    "we have also studied the implications for low - energy neutrino physics .",
    "the model can accommodate a hierarchical or an almost degenerate light neutrino spectrum .",
    "it also gives definite predictions for the @xmath63 decay mass parameter @xmath64 .",
    "in the so - called radiative leptogenesis framework , the hps mixing pattern is exact up to negligible running effects .",
    "furthermore , only a flavoured leptogenesis regime is allowed .",
    "if the @xmath1 symmetry is softly broken , e.g. by a mass term that lifts the heavy majorana neutrino degeneracy , then both unflavoured and flavoured leptogenesis can be implemented . in this case , corrections to tribimaximal mixing would lead to a nonvanishing @xmath65 and definite predictions for the low - energy @xmath5-violating phases .",
