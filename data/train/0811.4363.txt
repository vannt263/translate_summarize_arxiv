    "many complex systems in various areas of science exhibit a spatio - temporal dynamics that is inhomogeneous and can be effectively described by a superposition of several statistics on different scales , in short a superstatistics @xcite .",
    "the superstatistics notion was introduced in @xcite , in the mean time many applications for a variety of complex systems have been pointed out @xcite .",
    "essential for this approach is the existence of sufficient time scale separation between two relevant dynamics within the complex system .",
    "there is an intensive parameter @xmath1 that fluctuates on a much larger time scale than the typical relaxation time of the local dynamics . in a thermodynamic",
    "setting , @xmath1 can be interpreted as a local inverse temperature of the system , but much broader interpretations are possible .",
    "the stationary distributions of superstatistical systems , obtained by averaging over all @xmath1 , typically exhibit non - gaussian behavior with fat tails , which can be a power law , or a stretched exponential , or other functional forms as well @xcite .",
    "in general , the superstatistical parameter @xmath1 need not to be an inverse temperature but can be an effective parameter in a stochastic differential equation , a volatility in finance , or just a local variance parameter extracted from some experimental time series .",
    "many applications have been recently reported , for example in hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite , for defect turbulence @xcite , for cosmic rays @xcite and other scattering processes in high energy physics @xcite , solar flares @xcite , share price fluctuations @xcite , random matrix theory @xcite , random networks @xcite , multiplicative - noise stochastic processes @xcite , wind velocity fluctuations @xcite , hydro - climatic fluctuations @xcite , the statistics of train departure delays @xcite and models of the metastatic cascade in cancerous systems @xcite . on the theoretical side , there have been recent efforts to formulate maximum entropy principles for superstatistical systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we provide an overview over some recent developments in the area of superstatistics .",
    "three examples of recent applications are discussed in somewhat more detail : the statistics of lagrangian turbulence , the statistics of train departure delays , and the survival statistics of cancer patients . in all cases the superstatistical model predictions are in very good agreement with real data .",
    "we also comment on recent theoretical approaches to develop generalized maximum entropy principles for superstatistical systems .",
    "in generalized versions of statistical mechanics one starts from more general entropic measures than the boltzmann - gibbs shannon entropy .",
    "a well - known example is the @xmath2-entropy @xcite @xmath3 but other forms are possible as well ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the @xmath4 are the probabilities of the microstates @xmath5 , and @xmath2 is a real number , the entropic index .",
    "the ordinary shannon entropy is contained as the special case @xmath6 :    @xmath7    extremizing @xmath8 subject to suitable constraints yields more general canonical ensembles , where the probability to observe a microstate with energy @xmath9 is given by    @xmath10    one obtains a kind of power - law boltzmann factor , of the so - called @xmath2-exponential form .",
    "the important question is what could be a physical ( non - equilibrium mechanism ) to obtain such distributions .",
    "the reason could indeed be a driven nonequilibrium situation with local fluctuations of the environment .",
    "this is the situation where the superstatistics concept enters .",
    "our starting point is the following well - known formula    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the @xmath0 ( or @xmath13 ) probability distribution .",
    "we see that averaged _ ordinary _ boltzmann factors with @xmath0 distributed @xmath1 yield a _",
    "generalized _ boltzmann factor of @xmath2-exponential form .",
    "the physical interpretation is that tsallis type of statistical mechanics is relevant for _ nonequilibrium _ systems with temperature fluctuations .",
    "this approach was made popular by two prls in 2000/2001 @xcite , which used the @xmath0-distribution for @xmath14 .",
    "general @xmath14 were then discussed in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "it was suggested to construct a dynamical realization of @xmath2-statistics in terms of e.g. a linear langevin equation    @xmath15    with fluctuating parameters @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 denotes gaussian white noise .",
    "the parameters @xmath18 are supposed to fluctuate on a much larger time scale than the velocity @xmath19 .",
    "one can think of a brownian particle that moves through spatial cells with different local @xmath20 in each cell ( a nonequilibrium situation ) .",
    "assume the probability distribution of @xmath1 in the various cells is a @xmath0-distribution of degree @xmath21 : @xmath22 then the conditional probability given some fixed @xmath1 in a given cell is gaussian , @xmath23 , the joint probability is @xmath24 and the marginal probability is @xmath25 .",
    "integration yields @xmath26 i.e. we obtain power - law boltzmann factors with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 . here",
    "@xmath30 is the average of @xmath1 .",
    "the idea of superstatistics is to generalize this example to much broader systems .",
    "for example , @xmath1 need not be an inverse temperature but can in principle be any intensive parameter .",
    "most importantly , one can generalize to _ general probability densities @xmath14 _ and _ general hamiltonians_. in all cases one obtains a superposition of two different statistics : that of @xmath1 and that of ordinary statistical mechanics",
    ". superstatistics hence describes complex nonequilibrium systems with spatio - temporal fluctuations of an intensive parameter on a large scale .",
    "the _ effective _ boltzmann factors @xmath31 for such systems are given by    @xmath32    some recent theoretical developments of the superstatistics concept include the following :    * can prove a superstatistical generalization of fluctuation theorems @xcite * can develop a variational principle for the large - energy asymptotics of general superstatistics @xcite ( depending on @xmath14 , one can get not only power laws for large @xmath33 but e.g. also stretched exponentials ) * can formally define generalized entropies for general superstatistics @xcite * can study microcanonical superstatistics ( related to a mixture of @xmath2-values ) @xcite * can prove a superstatistical version of a central limit theorem leading to @xmath2-statistics @xcite * can relate it to fractional reaction equations @xcite * can consider superstatistical random matrix theory @xcite * can apply superstatistical techniques to networks @xcite * can define superstatistical path integrals @xcite * can do superstatistical time series analysis @xcite    ... and some more practical applications :    * can apply superstatistical methods to analyze the statistics of 3d hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite * can apply it to atmospheric turbulence ( wind velocity fluctuations @xcite ) * can apply superstatistical methods to finance and economics @xcite * can apply it to blinking quantum dots @xcite * can apply it to cosmic ray statistics @xcite * can apply it to various scattering processes in particle physics @xcite * can apply it to hydroclimatic fluctuations @xcite * can apply it to train delay statistics @xcite * can consider medical applications @xcite",
    "while in principle any @xmath14 is possible in the superstatistics approach , in practice one usually observes only a few relevant distributions .",
    "these are the @xmath0 , inverse @xmath0 and lognormal distribution . in other words , in typical complex systems with time scale separation one usually observes 3 physically relevant universality classes @xcite    * \\(a ) @xmath0-superstatistics ( @xmath34 tsallis statistics ) * \\(b ) inverse @xmath0-superstatistics * \\(c ) lognormal superstatistics    what could be a plausible reason for this ?",
    "consider , e.g. , case ( a ) .",
    "assume there are many microscopic random variables @xmath35 , @xmath36 , contributing to @xmath1 in an additive way .",
    "for large @xmath37 , the sum @xmath38 will approach a gaussian random variable @xmath39 due to the ( ordinary ) central limit theorem .",
    "there can be @xmath21 gaussian random variables @xmath40 of the same variance due to various relevant degrees of freedom in the system .",
    "@xmath1 should be positive , hence the simplest way to get such a positive @xmath1 is to square the gaussian random variables and sum them up . as a result",
    ", @xmath41 is @xmath0-distributed with degree @xmath21 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the average of @xmath1 .",
    "\\(b ) the same considerations can be applied if the temperature @xmath44 rather than @xmath1 itself is the sum of several squared gaussian random variables arising out of many microscopic degrees of freedom @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting @xmath14 is the inverse @xmath0-distribution : @xmath45 it generates superstatistical distributions @xmath46 that decay as @xmath47 for large @xmath33 .",
    "\\(c ) @xmath1 may be generated by multiplicative random processes .",
    "consider a local cascade random variable @xmath48 , where @xmath37 is the number of cascade steps and the @xmath35 are positive microscopic random variables . by the ( ordinary ) central limit theorem , for large @xmath37 the random variable @xmath49 becomes gaussian for large @xmath37 .",
    "hence @xmath39 is log - normally distributed .",
    "in general there may be @xmath21 such product contributions to @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "then @xmath51 is a sum of gaussian random variables , hence it is gaussian as well .",
    "thus @xmath1 is log - normally distributed , i.e. , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are suitable parameters .",
    "we will now discuss examples of the three different superstatistical universality classes .",
    "our first example is the departure delay statistics on the british rail network .",
    "clearly , at the various stations there are sometimes train departure delays of length @xmath55 . the 0th - order model for the waiting time would be a poisson process which predicts that the waiting time distribution until the train finally departs is @xmath56 , where @xmath1 is some parameter .",
    "but this does not agree with the actually observed data @xcite .",
    "a much better fit is given by a @xmath2-exponential , see fig .  1 .    )",
    ".,width=302 ]    what may cause this power law that fits the data ?",
    "the idea is that there are fluctuations in the parameter @xmath1 as well .",
    "these fluctuations describe large - scale temporal or spatial variations of the british rail network environment .",
    "examples of causes of these @xmath1-fluctuations :    * begin of the holiday season with lots of passengers * problem with the track * bad weather conditions * extreme events such as derailments , industrial action , terror alerts , etc .    as a result ,",
    "the long - term distribution of train delays is then a mixture of exponential distributions where the parameter @xmath1 fluctuates :    @xmath57    for a @xmath0-distributed @xmath1 with @xmath21 degrees of freedom one obtains    @xmath58    where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the model discussed in @xcite generates @xmath2-exponential distributions of train delays by a simple mechanism , namely a @xmath0-distributed parameter @xmath1 of the local poisson process .",
    "this is an example for @xmath0 superstatistics .",
    "our next example is an application in turbulence . consider a single tracer particle advected by a fully developed turbulent flow .",
    "for a while it will see regions of strong turbulent activity , then move on to calmer regions , just to continue in yet another region of strong activity , and so on .",
    "this is a superstatistical dynamics , and in fact superstatistical models of turbulence have been very successful in recent years @xcite .",
    "the typical shape of a trajectory of such a tracer particle is plotted in fig .  2 .",
    "this is lagrangian turbulence in contrast to eulerian turbulence , meaning that one is following a single particle in the flow . in particular , one is interested in velocity differences @xmath61 of the particle on a small time scale @xmath62 . for @xmath63",
    "this velocity difference becomes the local acceleration @xmath64 .",
    "a superstatistical lagrangian model for 3-dim velocity differences of the tracer particle has been developed in @xcite .",
    "one simply looks at a superstatistical langevin equation of the form    @xmath65    here @xmath66 and @xmath67 are constants . note that the term proportional to @xmath67 introduces some rotational movement of the particle , mimicking the vortices in the flow .",
    "the noise strength @xmath68 and the unit vector @xmath69 evolve stochastically on a large time scale @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , thus obtaining a superstatistical dynamics .",
    "@xmath70 is of the same order of magnitude as the integral time scale @xmath72 , whereas @xmath73 is of the same order of magnitude as the kolmogorov time scale @xmath74 .",
    "one can show that the reynolds number @xmath75 is basically given by the time scale ratio @xmath76 .",
    "the time scale @xmath77 describes the average life time of a region of given vorticity surrounding the test particle .    in this superstatistical turbulence model",
    "one defines the parameter @xmath1 to be @xmath78 , but it does _ not _ have the meaning of a physical inverse temperature in the flow .",
    "rather , one has @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath81 is the average energy dissipation , which is known to fluctuate in turbulent flows .",
    "in fact , kolmogorov s theory of 1961 suggests a lognormal distribution for @xmath82 , which automatically leads us to lognormal superstatistics : it is reasonable to assume that the probability density of the stochastic process @xmath83 is approximately a lognormal distribution @xmath84 for very small @xmath62 the 1d acceleration component of the particle is given by @xmath85 and one gets out of the model the 1-point distribution @xmath86 this prediction agrees very well with experimentally measured data of the acceleration statistics , which exhibits very pronounced ( non - gaussian ) tails , see fig .  3 for an example .    )",
    "( see @xcite for more details).,width=302 ]    it is interesting to see that our 3-dimensional superstatistical model predicts the existence of correlations between the acceleration components .",
    "for example , the acceleration @xmath87 in @xmath88 direction is not statistically independent of the acceleration @xmath89 in @xmath90-direction .",
    "we may study the ratio @xmath91 of the joint probability @xmath92 to the 1-point probabilities @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "for independent acceleration components this ratio would always be given by @xmath95 .",
    "however , our 3-dimensional superstatistical model yields prediction @xmath96 this is a very general formula , valid for any superstatistics , for example also tsallis statistics , obtained when @xmath14 is the @xmath0-distribution .",
    "the trivial result @xmath95 is obtained only for @xmath97 , i.e.  no fluctuations in the parameter @xmath1 at all .",
    "4 shows @xmath91 as predicted by lognormal superstatistics :    ) , @xmath14 being the lognormal distribution.,width=302 ]    the shape of this is very similar to experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "our final example of application of superstatistics is for a completely different area : medicine .",
    "we will look at cell migration processes describing the metastatic cascade of cancerous cells in the body @xcite .",
    "there are various pathways in which cancerous cells can migrate : via the blood system , the lymphatic system , and so on .",
    "the diffusion constants for these various pathways are different . in this way",
    "superstatistics enters , describing different diffusion speeds for different pathways ( see fig .",
    "5 ) .",
    "but there is another important issue here : when looking at a large ensemble of patients then the spread of cancerous cells can be very different from patient to patient . for some patients the cancer spreads in a very aggressive way , whereas for others it is much slower and less aggressive .",
    "so superstatistics also arises from the fact that all patients are different .    a superstatistical model of metastasis and cancer survival has been developed in @xcite .",
    "details are described in that paper .",
    "here we just mention the final result that comes out of the model : one obtains the following prediction for the probability density function of survival time @xmath55 of a patient that is diagnosed with cancer at @xmath98 : @xmath99 or @xmath100 , \\label{eq7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the modified bessel function .",
    "note that this is inverse @xmath0 superstatistics .",
    "the role of the parameter @xmath1 is now played by the parameter @xmath102 , which in a sense describes how aggressively the cancer propagates .    the above formula based on inverse @xmath0 superstatistics is in good agreement with real data of the survival statistics of breast cancer patients in the us .",
    "the superstatistical formula fits the observed distribution very well , both in a linear and logarithmic plot ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "one remark is at order .",
    "when looking at the relevant time scales one should keep in mind that the data shown are survival distributions _ conditioned on the fact that death occurs due to cancer_. many patients , in particular if they are diagnosed at an early stage , will live a long happy life and die from something else than cancer .",
    "these cases are _ not _ included in the data .    ,",
    "both in a linear and double logarithmic plot . only patients that die from cancer are included in the statistics .",
    "the solid line is the superstatistical model prediction @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] , both in a linear and double logarithmic plot .",
    "only patients that die from cancer are included in the statistics .",
    "the solid line is the superstatistical model prediction @xcite .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",
    "we finish this article by briefly mentioning some other recent interesting theoretical developments .",
    "one major theoretical concern is that a priori the superstatistical distribution @xmath14 can be anything .",
    "but perhaps one should single out the really relevant distributions @xmath14 by a least biased guess , given some constraints on the complex system under consideration .",
    "this program has been developed in some recent papers @xcite .",
    "there are some ambiguities which constraints should be implemented , and how . a very general formalism is presented in @xcite , which contains previous work @xcite as special cases .",
    "the three important universality classes discussed above , namely @xmath0 superstatistics , inverse @xmath0 superstatistics and lognormal superstatistics are contained as special cases in the formalism of @xcite . in principle , once a suitable generalized maximum entropy principle has been formulated for superstatistical systems , one can proceed to a generalized thermodynamic description , get a generalized equation of state , and so on .",
    "there is still a lot of scope of future research to develop the most suitable formalism .",
    "but the general tendency seems to be to apply maximum entropy principles and least biased guesses to nonequilibrium situations as well .",
    "in fact , jaynes @xcite always thought this is possible .",
    "another interesting development is what one could call a superstatistical path integral .",
    "these are just ordinary path integrals but with an additional integration over a parameter @xmath1 that make the wiener process become something more complicated , due to large - scale fluctuations of its diffusion constant .",
    "jizba et al .",
    "investigate under which conditions one obtains a markov process again @xcite .",
    "it seems some distributions @xmath14 are distinguished as making the superstatistical process simpler than others , preserving markovian - like properties .",
    "these types of superstatistical path integral processes have applications in finance , and possibly also in quantum field theory and elementary particle physics .    in high energy physics ,",
    "many of the power laws observed for differential cross sections and energy spectra in high energy scattering processes can also be explained using superstatistical models @xcite .",
    "the key point here is to extend the hagedorn theory @xcite to a superstatistical one which properly takes into account temperature fluctuations @xcite .",
    "superstatistical techniques have also been recently used to describe the space - time foam in string theory @xcite .",
    "superstatistics ( a statistics of a statistics ) provides a physical reason why more general types of boltzmann factors ( e.g.  @xmath2-exponentials or other functional forms ) are relevant for _ nonequilibrium _ systems with suitable fluctuations of an intensive parameter .",
    "let us summarize :    * there is evidence for three major physically relevant universality classes : @xmath0-superstatistics @xmath34 tsallis statistics , inverse @xmath0-superstatistics , and lognormal superstatistics .",
    "these arise as universal limit statistics for many different systems . *",
    "superstatistical techniques can be successfully applied to a variety of complex systems with time scale separation . *",
    "the train delays on the british railway network are an example of @xmath0 superstatistics = tsallis statistics @xcite . * a superstatistical model of _ lagrangian turbulence _",
    "@xcite is in excellent agreement with the experimental data for probability densities , correlations between components , decay of correlations , lagrangian scaling exponents , etc .",
    "this is an example of lognormal superstatistics @xcite .",
    "* cancer survival statistics is described by inverse @xmath0 superstatistics @xcite . *",
    "the long - term aim is to find a good thermodynamic description for general superstatistical systems .",
    "a generalized maximum entropy principle may help to achieve this goal .",
