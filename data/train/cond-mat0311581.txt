    "since the mid 1980s , the daily turnover in financial markets has increased sharply . moreover , the trading volume increasingly reflects very short - term and speculative transactions . in foreign exchange markets , for example , operations of intraday traders account for 75 percent of the market volume ( bank for international settlements 2002 ) . in comparison ,",
    "only 15 percent of the trading volume is on account of non - financial customers , with international trade transactions representing merely 1 percent of the total .",
    "the fast and hectic trading leads to complex financial market dynamics . according to cont ( 2001 ) and",
    "lux and ausloos ( 2002 ) , the behavior of financial prices may be characterized by five universal features : ( 1 ) the evolution of the prices shows little pair correlations between successive daily changes , ( 2 ) severe bubbles and crashes occasionally emerge , ( 3 ) the prices fluctuate strongly , ( 4 ) the distribution of log price changes possesses fat tails , and ( 5 ) periods of low volatility alternate with periods of high volatility . +",
    "two competing views exist about the efficiency of financial markets .",
    "the efficient market hypothesis states that prices reflect their fundamental values .",
    "thus , the statistical features of asset price changes are fully explained by those of the underlying fundamental process .",
    "for instance , volatility clustering arises since the intensity of news alternates over time .",
    "extreme price changes reflect the arrival of very important new information . however , it is hard to imagine that the aforementioned stylized facts are fully caused by an exogenous news process .",
    "+ models with heterogeneous interacting agents seem to describe the working of financial markets more realistically than the traditional neo - classical paradigm .",
    "for instance , in palmer et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , kirman ( 1991 ) , brock and hommes ( 1998 ) , cont and bouchaud ( 2000 ) , lux and marchesi ( 2000 ) , or farmer and joshi ( 2002 ) , the dynamics is mainly driven endogenously through the activity of boundedly rational speculators .",
    "complicated dynamics may arise due to non - linear trading strategies , switching between different types of predictors , or social interactions such as herding behavior .",
    "clearly , these models indicate that financial markets may not be efficient .",
    "+ if the activity of speculators creates distortions , it is interesting to ask whether there exist any means to regulate these markets .",
    "recently , several models with heterogeneous interacting agents have been applied as computer laboratories to explore whether certain policy measures may stabilize financial markets .",
    "note that such simulation experiments have the advantage that they allow the exploration of a certain policy in a well - defined and controlled environment .",
    "for instance , one can control for all kinds of random shocks , measure the policy objectives precisely and produce as many observations as required .",
    "+ the focus of this paper is how the tobin tax affects foreign exchange markets .",
    "as early as 1972 , tobin ( 1978 ) suggested imposing a uniform tax of around 1 percent on all currency transactions in order to curb speculation . nowadays , a tax rate of between 0.05 and 0.5 percent is being discussed ( eichengreen et al .",
    "1995 , haq et al .",
    "1996 , frankel 1996 , mende and menkhoff 2003 ) .",
    "supporters of tobin s proposal claim that a transaction tax favors long - term investments over short - term investments .",
    "note that around 80 percent of the daily speculation trade takes place because traders would like to take advantage of profits below the @xmath2 border .",
    "the effect of a small tax rate could therefore be quite strong .",
    "on the other hand , a low tax rate should not harm firms engaged in international trade .",
    "advocates of the tobin tax also argue that such a device could also raise a substantial amount of tax revenues .",
    "+ ehrenstein ( 2003 ) , using the microscopic herding model of cont and bouchaud ( 2000 ) , finds that a tobin tax may successfully reduce exchange rate volatility .",
    "moreover , the tax revenue in some of the model versions is maximized at a tax rate of around 0.5 percent , which sounds quite realistic .",
    "westerhoff ( 2003a ) develops a simple model with interacting chartists and fundamentalists .",
    "he also reports that a small transaction tax may stabilize foreign exchange markets .",
    "but if the tax rate is too high , i.e. above 1 percent , too many stabilizing fundamental traders may leave the market and mispricing may increase again .",
    "however , both papers have overlooked an important feedback mechanism which may counter the influence of a tobin tax .",
    "the reduction in short - term transactions naturally reduces market depth which may , in turn , increase volatility . clearly , the price adjustment due to a given order depends on market depth : the less liquid a market is , the stronger the price responsiveness of a given transaction .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to re - examine the effectiveness of the tobin tax .",
    "we use a modified version of the cont - bouchaud model ( 2000 ) in which the communication structure between the traders is modeled as a random graph .",
    "cont and bouchaud show that interactions between market participants through imitation can lead to large fluctuations in aggregate demand .",
    "since the cont - bouchaud model gives a reasonable description of financial markets and is able to generate realistic price dynamics we feel safe to use it as a computer laboratory .",
    "we find that the imposition of a transaction tax may decrease both volatility and distortions even if a reduction in market depth increases the price responsiveness of a given trade",
    ". moreover , policy makers may raise substantial tax revenues .",
    "however , if the price impact function is too sensitive with respect to liquidity , stabilization may turn into destabilization .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 briefly repeats the basic elements of the cont - bouchaud framework .",
    "section 3 presents the experimental design and section 4 summarizes our main results .",
    "the final section concludes the paper .",
    "the goal of cont and bouchaud ( 2000 ) is to study the impact of herding behavior among speculators on asset price dynamics . let us briefly repeat the model s main components .",
    "we put our agents onto a randomly occupied square lattice and empty with probability @xmath3 .",
    "neighboring occupied sites form clusters . if a contiguous path of occupied sites connects the top and bottom of the lattice for the first time , the threshold value @xmath4= @xmath5 is reached . ] since previous work ( stauffer 2001 ) showed that the type of the lattice does not matter much .",
    "cont and bouchaud consider a stock market with @xmath6 agents , labeled with an integer @xmath7 , trading a single asset . during each time period , the agents have three options : to buy one unit of the asset , to sell one unit of the asset , or to remain inactive .",
    "the demand of agent @xmath8 in period @xmath9 is represented by @xmath10 where the parameter @xmath11 captures the activity of the agents .",
    "a value of @xmath12 obviously allows for a finite fraction of agents not to trade during a given period as a measure of the length of the time we handle in one iteration .",
    "if @xmath13 is close to 0.5 , we simulate low frequency data since nearly all market participants are active .",
    "otherwise , a small @xmath13 reflects high frequency trading since only few agents are active in a given time step . ] . in order to focus on the effect of herding , cont and bouchaud",
    "do not explicitly model the decision process leading to the individual demands .",
    "their random character may , for instance , be due to random resources of the agents .",
    "such behavior is often called noise trading .",
    "+ aggregate excess demand , i.e. the sum of all orders , is the sole driving force of the asset price : excess buying drives up the price and excess selling drives down the price .",
    "the price adjustment is formalized by a log - linear price impact function @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the log price at time @xmath9 and @xmath16 stands for a positive liquidity parameter describing how much excess demand is needed to move the asset price by one unit . note that log price changes and excess demand vary proportionally .",
    "cont and bouchaud set @xmath16= 1 .",
    "+ in real markets , agents may form groups of various sizes which may then share information and act in coordination . the agents group formation is described through a random matching process .",
    "all agents which are direct or indirect neighbours of each other form a cluster which adopts one common strategy of selling or buying .",
    "each agent has at most four direct neighbours but a large cluster (= company or coalition ) can be formed through the neighbours of neighbours etc . for an occupation probability @xmath4 above @xmath17 a cluster connecting top and bottom is formed ; we work at this critical concentration . + the microscopic model of cont and bouchaud and its variants have the power to mimic actual asset price dynamics quite closely ( stauffer 2001 ) . for an activity @xmath13 close to 0.5 and",
    "@xmath4= @xmath5 the distribution of the returns is similar to a gaussian curve .",
    "however , for a smaller activity level , one obtains heavy tails in the distribution of the returns .",
    "moreover , weak correlations exist between successive returns and strong correlations between successive absolute returns . since prices do not react to news , one may also argue that the speculators cause distortions and excess volatility .",
    "some adjustments are necessary to be able to study the effectiveness of the tobin tax within the cont - bouchaud framework .",
    "+ first , since log - price changes of the cont - bouchaud model are often large integers and the tobin tax is a very small number ( i.e. less than 1 percent ) , we have to normalize the returns . in reality , extreme price changes in major foreign exchange markets seldomly exceed the 5 percent level .",
    "thus , we take here @xmath18 percent .",
    "this means that if all clusters in an iteration are active and buying , the return is + 5 percent . otherwise , if all clusters are active and selling , the return is set to -5 percent .",
    "certainly , not all clusters will trade in the same direction in the same iteration .",
    "+ second , we impose a tobin tax on all currency transactions .",
    "this changes the behavior of the speculators in the following way .",
    "the speculators believe that the log - price change in period @xmath19 is authoritative for the log - price change development in period @xmath9 .",
    "thus , if the absolute value of the log - price change is lower than the tax rate , speculation is identified as not profitable . as a result",
    ", speculators become inactive . +",
    "third , we include international trade transactions .",
    "the orders of international firms , on which the tobin tax has no impact , consist of two elements : an unsystematic random component and a systematic deterministic component .",
    "the unsystematic component reflects random liquidity needs of the firms , e.g. to pay bills in a foreign currency .",
    "this is implemented by assuming that 1 percent of all clusters describe the behavior of firms .",
    "the systematic component is due to current account imbalances .",
    "for instance , if the exchange rate is overvalued then exports exceed imports .",
    "the systematic demand of the international firms is given as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the log of the fundamental value and @xmath22 is a positive reaction coefficient . according to ( 3 ) , current account imbalances increase with the mispricing of the exchange rate .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which implies that each day @xmath25 of 1 percent of any gap from the fundamental value dissipates .",
    "this translates into a realistic half - life of about 2 years .",
    "+ fourth , cont and bouchaud assume a proportionality between aggregated excess demand and log - price changes which is a reasonable approximation as long as the market depth does not vary too strongly .",
    "however , since the tobin tax may significantly crowd out speculative transactions , we introduce a non - linear price impact function .",
    "in particular , we assume that a given transaction causes a small ( large ) price change if market liquidity is high ( low ) .",
    "let @xmath26 be the normalization factor to scale the dynamics according to @xmath27 , then the price adjustment may be written as @xmath28 with @xmath29^g } } } .\\ ] ] + the exponent @xmath30 captures the curvature of the price adjustment while @xmath31 is a positive shift parameter .",
    "the market depth is given as the sum of all currency transactions within the last @xmath32 trading periods .",
    "note that for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , ( 4 ) is identical to the price impact function of the original cont - bouchaud model . for @xmath35 , the price impact of a given order decreases with increasing liquidity .      in a nutshell ,",
    "the simulations are executed as follows :    * with the algorithm of hoshen and kopelman we determine the number of clusters with @xmath36 agents .",
    "* we decide randomly if the cluster is active in this iteration . * * if the cluster is active we test whether the condition for profitable speculation is fulfilled . * * * if this is the case we decide by another random number if the cluster would like to buy or sell an amount which corresponds to the size of the cluster . * * * if the condition is not true we decide through another random number if the cluster is forced to trade because it belongs to one of the international firms . * * * * if the cluster is an international firm , we decide randomly whether the cluster would like to buy or sell . * * * * if the cluster does not trade it has no impact on the dynamics . * * if the cluster is not active it has no impact on the dynamics .",
    "* if all clusters have been processed we determine the new price and the iteration is finished . *",
    "the procedure is repeated for the next iteration .",
    "before we turn to the simulation results let us first define three important policy objectives .",
    "a high exchange rate variability implies a high risk for internationally operating firms .",
    "as is well known , the higher the exchange rate volatility is , the more strongly risk - averse firms retreat from international trade , which is bad for the markets .",
    "thus , policy makers have an incentive to control exchange rate risk .",
    "if the exchange rate is misaligned , long - term capital investments may flow into inefficient sectors . to achieve a good capital allocation",
    ", prices should reflect their fundamental values closely . finally , the imposition of a transaction tax generates an additional source of income .",
    "we formalize these criteria as follows .",
    "volatility is computed as @xmath37 distortion as @xmath38 and the tax revenue as @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the sample length and tax is the tax rate .",
    "the simulations are based on t=100,000 .",
    "we are now ready to explore the impact of the tobin tax on the dynamics of foreign exchange markets .",
    "we fix the following parameters : @xmath6= 570 , @xmath13= 0.4999 , @xmath5= 0.592746 , @xmath22= 0.001 , @xmath31= 1 .",
    "figure 1 shows the results for @xmath41 , i.e. market liquidity only depends on the actual trading volume .",
    "the first panel of figure 1 displays the reaction of the volatility for @xmath42= 0 ( the `` + + + ' ' -line ) , @xmath42= 0.19 ( the `` @xmath43 @xmath43 @xmath43''-line ) and @xmath42= 0.4 ( the `` @xmath44 @xmath44 @xmath44''-line ) . the transaction tax is increased from 0 to 1 percent . as can be seen , volatility decreases , remains constant , or even increases due to currency taxation has an impact on the absolute level of the volatility .",
    "however , the shift parameter @xmath31 allows the rescaling of the starting point such that the curves have the same origin . such rescaling does not qualitatively change our results . ] .",
    "the second panel of figure 1 reveals similar results for the distortion .",
    "a tobin tax may help drive prices closer towards fundamentals as long as @xmath42 is not too large .",
    "for instance , for @xmath42= 0 , a tobin tax of 0.2 percent decreases volatility by more than 50 percent and distortion by around 33 percent .",
    "finally , the third panel of figure 1 presents the income generating potential of the tobin tax . up to around @xmath42= 0.19",
    ", the tax revenue function has a maximum . for higher values of the exponent ,",
    "tax revenues increase with increasing tax rates , at least for tax rates below 1 percent .",
    "note also that the revenue maximizing tax rate may not coincide with the volatility minimizing tax rate ( e.g. for @xmath42= 0 ) . in this sense",
    ", policy makers may set the tax rate too low in order to generate higher tax revenues .",
    "+ these results deserve further attention .",
    "note first that the tobin tax may indeed achieve a triple dividend even if a reduction in market depth increases the price responsiveness of a given order .",
    "this may be regarded as good news for policy makers since it allows them to stabilize foreign exchange markets and to generate government income .",
    "proponents of the tobin tax always have this case in mind .",
    "however , our simulations also give a warning to policy makers : the success of a tobin tax is not absolutely sure .",
    "if the curvature of the price impact function is too extreme ( i.e. @xmath45 0.2 ) , the tobin tax destabilizes the market in the sense that both volatility and distortion increase . for @xmath42= 0.4",
    ", even a minimal tax rate always increases exchange rate variability .",
    "the latter result stands in sharp contrast to earlier findings on the usefulness of transaction taxes .",
    "+ are these estimates robust ?",
    "figure 2 displays the results for @xmath32= 20 , that is the market depth is taken as the trading volume over the last 20 observations ( now the `` + + + ' ' -line stands for @xmath42= 0 , the `` @xmath43 @xmath43 @xmath43''-line for @xmath42= 0.2 and the `` @xmath44 @xmath44 @xmath44''-line for @xmath42= 0.4 ) .",
    "since the model refers to daily data , 20 observations correspond to a time span of one month .",
    "again , we find that the tobin tax is not always stabilizing . however , if market liquidity depends on a longer time horizon , then the advocates of the tobin tax have reason to be more optimistic . for @xmath42= 0.2 , for instance , we still see a sharp drop in volatility and distortion .",
    "further examinations revealed that as @xmath32 increases further , say up to 50 or 100 trading periods , volatility and distortion decrease for much higher values of the exponent @xmath42 .",
    "short - term speculations generate excess volatility . as a result , financial markets often lack anchoring in fundamentals . tobin ( 1978 ) thus proposed a levy on all foreign - exchange transactions .",
    "the tax should be small enough to be fairly negligible for firms engaged in international trade , yet wipe out a lot of short - term speculation .",
    "short - term financial round - trip excursions amplify even a very low tax rate .",
    "for instance , a tax of 0.1 percent , measured in terms of annualized expected rates of return , would come to a 43 percent ] penalty on one - day speculation .",
    "although the tobin tax is frequently discussed in the popular media , it has remained under - researched in academia .",
    "+ this paper uses the well - known herding model of cont and bouchaud to investigate the consequences of a transaction tax on foreign exchange dynamics .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , this paper takes into account that a reduction in market depth increases the price responsiveness of a given trade .",
    "overall , we find that a transaction tax may help dampen economically unjustified speculation . to be precise ,",
    "a triple dividend may be achieved : volatility and distortion decrease while government income increases . however , there exist critical values of the exponent @xmath42 above which market stability may decrease .",
    "+ it may therefore be theoretically possible that a tobin tax worsens market efficiency . whether this outcome is realistic or not is an empirical question .",
    "so , how strong is the curvature of the price impact function with respect to market depth ?",
    "unfortunately , no clear answer exists .",
    "kempf and korn ( 1999 ) , using data on dax futures , and plerou et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , using data on the 116 most - frequently traded us stocks , find that the price impact function displays a concave curvature with increasing order size , and flattening at larger values . put differently , the smaller is the average price impact per trade unit , the larger is the order size . weber and rosenow ( 2003 ) also fitted a concave function in the form of a power law and obtained a correlation coefficient of 0.977 .",
    "the implications of such price impact functions have earlier been discussed by zhang ( 1999 ) .",
    "more closely related with our setup , lillo , farmer and mantenga ( 2003 ) report that higher capitalization stocks tend to have smaller price responses for the same ( normalized ) transaction size . since market capitalization is correlated with liquidity , the price impact function is presumbly non - linear .",
    "but the non - linearity may not be very extreme , at least in the case of foreign exchange markets .",
    "for instance , evans and lyons ( 2002 ) , who estimate that $ 1 billion of net dollar purchases increases the deutsche mark price of a dollar by 0.5 percent , could not improve their fit by including non - linarities .",
    "however , their data set only includes about 80 daily observations .",
    "note also that market depth in foreign exchange markets has increased sharply since the 1970s without producing lower volatility . put differently ,",
    "if the current average daily turnover of $ 1,200 billion would decrease by , say 50 percent , due to currency taxation , market depth would still remain extremely high .",
    "a turnover of $ 600 billion - still higher than the turnover in 1989 - times a tax rate of , say 0.1 percent , would then generate an annual tax revenue of $ 220 billion .",
    "our simulations ignore the administrative costs of collecting the tax as well as the dangers arising from more government control over its citizens through the tax information . + * references * + bank for international settlements ( 2002 ) : central bank survey of foreign exchange and derivatives market activity 2001 , basle .",
