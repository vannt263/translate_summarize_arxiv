    "all - optical approaches to attaining bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) allow the trapping of spin - zero species ( which can not be held in a magnetic trap ) , and multiple , arbitrary spin states at once .",
    "in addition , the technique is convenient , avoiding large magnetic field coils that restrict optical access and allowing rapid evaporative cooling and condensation .",
    "a number of variations on this technique have been used successfully to condense a variety of atomic species . here",
    "we present the first all - optical approach to evaporatively obtain bec in sodium . additionally , we extend the technique to multiple traps in a configuration useful for atom optics experiments .",
    "our stainless steel vacuum chamber incorporates an ion detector which we use to sensitively detect photoassociation transitions .",
    "this signal is sensitive to the atomic density and provides a convenient way to optimize the loading of our dipole trap and bec formation within the trap .",
    "the first demonstration of evaporative cooling of a sodium gas held in a crossed dipole trap @xcite was performed in 1995 .",
    "the trap was formed by a pair of beams from a nd : yag laser operating at 1.06 @xmath0 m , detuned well red of the atomic resonance . in these studies",
    "the phase space density of the gas was increased by a factor of 28 , but did not reach the conditions required to bose - condense the rather small sample used .",
    "later that year bec in sodium was first observed @xcite in a trap that employed magnetic confinement along with an optical `` plug '' to keep atoms away from a region of zero magnetic field . while magnetic traps of many forms have since dominated bec studies , interest in all - optical methods has continued as well .    in this paper",
    "we return to investigate evaporative cooling of sodium in a crossed - beam dipole trap . with sufficient initial loading of the dipole trap",
    ", we find that it is relatively straightforward to achieve bec with up to 2.5  @xmath1  10@xmath2 @xmath3na atoms by simply ramping down the trap laser intensity .",
    "the dipole trapping beams give us flexibility in arranging the location of the condensate and allows us to create traps with different spin - component populations . by recycling the beams , we construct multiple crossing regions with variable spacings .",
    "for instance , we can easily arrange a square array of four optical traps , spaced by @xmath4  250  @xmath0 m , and produce a condensate in each trap , as shown in fig .",

    "producing bec without the use of a magnetic trap was first demonstrated with @xmath5rb in 2001 @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the trap was formed by crossed , tightly - focussed beams from a co@xmath6 laser operating at a wavelength near 10  @xmath0 m . since that time bec in optical traps",
    "has been observed with several other species as well , using traps and procedures of varying complexity .",
    "@xmath7cs @xcite was condensed in a combined co@xmath6/fiber laser dipole trap .",
    "cs is heavy and difficult to condense , requiring magnetic field gradients to cancel the force of gravity and bias fields to tune the scattering length by using a magnetic feshbach resonance . in this case weakly - focussed beams from the co@xmath6-laser trap the cs atoms , and a tightly - focussed beam at 1064  nm is introduced to create a  dimple \" in the trap , where atoms can evaporate to higher density .",
    "cr was recently condensed @xcite by an evaporative cooling sequence which begins in a magnetic trap , and is completed after transferring the atoms to a crossed - dipole optical trap .",
    "such traps are not restricted to the infrared : @xmath8yb , with its strongest transition near 400 nm , was condensed in a crossed - dipole trap @xcite formed from a 532 nm laser .",
    "the technique is also applicable to fermions , and evaporative cooling in a single beam co@xmath6-laser optical trap has also been used to produce a degenerate fermi gas of @xmath9li atoms @xcite .",
    "many variations of the loading sequence , including the ramping of laser intensity and magnetic field , as well as dynamic changes in the optical system , have proven successful .",
    "many of these complexities are dictated by the specifics of the atomic species that are used , especially their collision properties . in comparison with many of these previous experiments ,",
    "sodium bec can be achieved in a relatively simple sequence .",
    "no magnetic field gradient is required to compensate for gravity , and we use 1.07  @xmath0 m light from a fiber laser , which does not require the special window materials that are needed in the far infrared .",
    "furthermore , we use a simple intensity ramp with no moving optics , resulting in a relatively uncomplicated and robust procedure .",
    "we begin our experiment with atoms accumulated in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) fed with a zero - crossing zeeman slower .",
    "our mot is of order 2  mm in diameter , while the optical trap has a 1/@xmath10 waist of 61  @xmath11  3  @xmath0 m , resulting in a poor geometric overlap for loading . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite the loading process is somewhat complex and various schemes have been developed for improving it . to attain bec in our experiments",
    "we have maintained a fixed trap size and concentrated on optimizing the loading by adjusting the way in which we ramp down the mot light and magnetic field .    to monitor the buildup of the atomic density in the optical trap",
    "we introduce a photoassociation technique .",
    "photoassociation ( pa ) is the process where two colliding atoms absorb a photon and form an electronically excited diatomic molecule @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ pasketch ] ) .",
    "photoassociation has been used to produce high - resolution spectra of the molecular states that are accessible in this way .",
    "the photoassociation transition can be detected in a number of ways , the two most common are trap loss and ionization . when a molecule is formed two atoms are removed from the trap , and a simple detection of atom number ( by absorption or fluorescence ) , as a function of frequency , can be used to locate a pa transition .",
    "if the excited molecule can be further excited to an autoionizing state , or to an ionization continuum , the presence of an ion signal will indicate the pa transition .",
    "on the other hand , the technique can also be used as a probe for a number of effects , such as wavefunction distortion by magnetic @xcite or optical feshbach @xcite resonances , or , as in this case , as a sensitive probe of the atomic density .",
    "many of the low - lying states of na@xmath6 have been studied using photoassociation techniques , and in the current experiments we take advantage of a photoassociation - ionization transition that we have used in previous spectroscopy experiments @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that we can monitor the evolution of the trap density in our experiment using a pa ionization signal produced by two auxiliary lasers .",
    "one laser is tuned to a known molecular transition and the second is tuned to promote the excited molecule to a high - lying autoionizing state .",
    "the result is the production of na@xmath12 ions , which we detect with a microchannel plate . for the present purposes the important feature of the pa signal",
    "is that it depends on the square of the atomic density , and thus the signal is most sensitive to atoms in the dipole trap rather than those in the diffuse cloud of atoms around it , even though there are many more atoms in this cloud . within the trap it is most sensitive to atoms in the lowest vibrational states of the trap , where the density is highest .",

    "the experimental setup and timing sequence are shown in fig .",

    "[ experiment]b , respectively . our approach to attaining bec proceeds as follows :",
    "the dipole trap is loaded from a standard zeeman - slower - fed , six - beam , dark - spot , magneto - optical trap ( mot ) .",
    "this produces , after a loading time of about 8  s , a sample of 7@xmath15 @xmath3na atoms at about 300  @xmath0k , in a volume of @xmath4(2 mm)@xmath16 .",
    "a single , traveling - wave , annular repumping beam , tuned to the 3s f=1 @xmath17 3p@xmath18 f=2 transition , is used along with the cooling light , tuned to the red of the 3s f=2 @xmath17 3p@xmath18 f=3 cycling transition , to form the dark - spot mot .",
    "nearly all of the atoms are thus in the f=1 hyperfine state .",
    "this reduces hyperfine - changing collisions in the dipole trap and is required for the application of further cooling techniques .",
    "the dipole trap is formed by crossing two focussed beams in the mot volume , as described below , and is turned on during the final 2.5 seconds of the mot phase . at this time",
    "the intensity of the cooling light is reduced from 6 mw/@xmath19 to 3 mw/@xmath19 in each beam , producing a weak mot to further cool the atomic sample . loading the dipole trap directly from the mot at this point ,",
    "gives a trapped atom number of only 3@xmath20 ( measured by absorption imaging 100 ms after the mot phase ) .        to increase the number of atoms loaded into the dipole trap a 60 ms transitional ",
    "molasses \" phase is applied as the mot is gradually turned off . during this time the magnetic field gradient from the mot coils",
    "is lowered from 0.5  mt / cm to 0  mt / cm and the detuning of the cooling light is increased from 24 mhz to 32  mhz ( measured red from the 3s@xmath21 f=2 @xmath17 3p@xmath18 f=3 cooling transition at 16973 @xmath22 ) .",
    "the repumping beam during this period continues to be a single , annular , traveling - wave beam .",
    "the ramp starts from a detuned strong mot condition that at first compresses the atomic cloud . as the ramp continues the temperature of the cloud",
    "is decreased .",
    "the final temperature of the cloud after this phase is 50  @xmath0k .",
    "the currents in a set of magnetic - field - nulling coils are adjusted in order to achieve the lowest temperature at this phase .",
    "after this 60 ms molasses phase all near - resonant laser beams are extinguished by acousto - optical modulators ( aoms ) , followed by mechanical shutters .",
    "this loading process determines the initial phase space density , and thus , whether or not it is finally possible to reach quantum degeneracy .",
    "the molasses phase is followed by a 300 ms period of free evaporation , during which the dipole trapping beams are held at constant power .",
    "finally , we have a period of forced evaporation during which both dipole trapping beams are ramped down in power , simultaneously , over a time of 12.5 s. the timing sequence of the different experimental steps is shown in fig .",
    "[ experiment]b .",
    "the details of the experiment , and the diagnostics applied to optimize this sequence are discussed in the next section .",
    "the trapping beams are produced by a commercial yb - doped fiber laser which can generate up to 100  w of 1.07  @xmath0 m light .",
    "the line width of this laser is @xmath4  3  nm and the polarization is random .",
    "( the polarization changes quickly on the time scale of the typical oscillation periods of the atoms in the dipole trap . ) in practice we operate the laser at @xmath23  40  w , since it shows excess intensity noise at higher powers .",
    "the trapping light passes through one aom .",
    "the first diffracted order from the aom goes to the experiment and the intensity of this beam is controlled by the rf - drive power .",
    "the beams are divided by a non - polarizing beam - splitter cube and focussed into the vacuum chamber with 300 mm focal length lenses .",
    "note that we do not need to polarize the beams or introduce frequency shifts to wash out interference effects .",
    "the angle between the beams inside the chamber is @xmath24 and the beam waist in the crossing region is @xmath4  61  @xmath0 m ( 1/@xmath10 radius ) .",
    "the beam size is obtained from the trap oscillation frequency , laser power , and calculated stark shift .",
    "the plane of the crossed beams is perpendicular to gravity .",
    "each beam has a maximum power of 14  w at the trap location , corresponding to an initial potential depth of @xmath25k ( where k@xmath26 is the boltzman constant ) .    to analyze the properties of the atoms in the dipole trap , we can use absorption imaging .",
    "the atoms are released from the trap by turning off the trapping laser in order to minimize effects due to ac - stark shifts caused by the dipole trap .",
    "the number and temperature of the atoms are extracted using time - of - flight ( tof ) techniques . for short times after the end of the molasses phase , the absorption signal is dominated by the expanding mot cloud and it is necessary to allow the non - trapped fraction of the atoms to fall away before we can cleanly observe the atoms in the dipole trap .",
    "500  ms after switching off all resonant light we trap @xmath27 atoms in the whole dipole potential , and 2  @xmath28 atoms in the crossed region , with a temperature of 50  @xmath0k .",
    "this results in an initial peak atom density of 9  @xmath29  @xmath30 .",
    "the density is derived from the measured temperature , atom number , and trap oscillation frequency , and by assuming that the gaussian potential can be described by a harmonic approximation at the bottom of the trap .    to measure the trap oscillation frequency we parametrically excite the breathing mode of the trap .",
    "first we evaporatively cool the atoms , proceeding 3 s into the usual intensity ramp of the dipole trap ( discussed below ) .",
    "we then modulate the power of the dipole trap potential sinusoidally and measure trap loss as a function of modulation frequency using time - of - flight imaging .",
    "the mean oscillation frequency of the trap during the free evaporation stage is 1.7  @xmath11  0.2  khz .",
    "trap oscillation frequencies for other laser powers are derived from this by scaling to the square root of the measured power in the trap beams .",
    "we obtain the trap depth and the waist size from the oscillation frequency and the power in the trapping beams , again making a harmonic approximation @xcite .    to probe the evolution of the atom cloud during the molasses and evaporation stages , we employ a new technique which allows us to directly monitor the density of the atoms inside the trap .",
    "the density is probed by a pa laser which resonantly produces bound excited state molecules ( in the @xmath31 rotational level of the @xmath32 component of a vibrational level in the @xmath33 ( s+p@xmath18 ) potential @xcite ) .",
    "the laser frequency for this transition is 16845.16 @xmath22 .",
    "the molecules which are formed are then excited by an additional laser ( at 17099.95 @xmath22 ) to an autoionizing level ( see fig .",
    "[ pasketch ] ) .",
    "the ions that are produced are then efficiently detected by a microchannel plate .",
    "this ion signal is proportional to the volume integral over @xmath34 , where @xmath35 indicates the atom density . at the temperatures under consideration here ,",
    "this @xmath36-wave pa transition is in the wigner law regime and the pa signal is not directly dependent on the temperature ( average collision energy ) of the atoms , but simply depends on the density ( as discussed in @xcite ) .    in sodium",
    "the molecular energy levels are such that in a mot a steady ion signal is produced by the trapping beams themselves , so it is necessary to turn them off to see the pa signal .",
    "the pa and ionizing lasers are then turned on ( 4  mw and 5  mw , respectively , in an approximately 100  @xmath0 m spot size ) .",
    "the ion signal that is produced can be used to optimize the cooling process and the loading into the trap .",
    "figure [ motload ] shows the ion signal , measured in this way ( integrated over a 10  ms period ) , during our optimized 60  ms molasses ramp .",
    "the density increases continuously until the end of the 60  ms , at which point the magnetic field is zero . during the last few milliseconds of this stage the magnetic field at the location of the dipole trap is so small that the conditions are characteristic of a true optical molasses , and the final temperature",
    "is not improved by extending the molasses period beyond the end of the magnetic field ramp .     the na@xmath12 ion signal due to photoassociation ( pa ) , as explained in the text , which is used to optimize the trap loading sequence .",

    "we are continuously producing and ionizing molecules during this time , however , a 1  s duration pa pulse ( at a power of 340  @xmath0w ) reduces the atom number by only 5@xmath37 and represents a small perturbation on the trapped atom density dynamics . in fig .",

    "the evaporation process causes atom loss and is not compensated by any loading during this time .",
    "the remaining atoms rethermalize at higher density .",
    "the increase in density slows down with time and , finally , if held too long , the loss out of the trap becomes the dominant process and the density starts to decrease .",

    "[ freeevap ] .",
    "the trap lifetime under these conditions , as seen in the figure , is fairly short and is possibly limited by beam - pointing instabilities induced by thermal effects ( due to the high rf power in the aom which controls the power into the trapping beams ) . adding feedback to the aom to stabilize the laser intensity",

    "we then apply a magnetic field gradient with our mot coils and , in this case , we find that the population of the magnetic spin components is different for the two traps .",
    "in fact , the spin distributions map to the different trap positions and allows for almost pure spin states under some conditions . by successively changing the crossing position and having a little bit luck ,",
    "one is able to obtain most of the population in a single magnetic sublevel without having to apply any additional optical pumping .",
    "the polarization of the sample is apparently due to the local magnetic field and laser imbalances in the mot and molasses phases , which produce varying m@xmath42 distributions in different spatial locations , which are then preserved in the trap .     a ) absorption images after a time - of - flight of two condensates generated by retro - reflecting one trapping beam as described in the text . during the time - of - flight a magnetic field gradient",
    "is applied , separating the m@xmath42 levels .",
    "line trace of the distribution of atoms between the m@xmath56 states for the upper ( b ) , and lower ( c ) cloud .",
    "the distribution depends on the position of the trap in the mot .",
    "the dotted lines represent a fit to the sum of three displaced gaussians , from which the relative populations are extracted . ]",
    "the technique that we describe here represents our first effort and could be improved upon by , amongst other things , stabilizing the laser intensity at higher powers with an aom .",
    "problems due to pointing instabilities could also be improved by better heat - sinking of the aom to reduce temperature fluctuations caused by changes in rf powers to the aom .",
    "the beam spot size has not been optimized in these experiments , and it is still to be determined if we can trap more atoms and produce larger condensates by using a larger spot size ( taking advantage of the factor of 2 - 3 more power that we have available ) . eventually , at large trap sizes the evaporation to bec will be stalled by the lack of density or limited by background gas scattering as we require longer evaporation times .    in this paper",
    "we have demonstrated a straightforward , all - optical method of production of sodium bose - einstein condensates . with some variation in parameters , this approach could be used for other species as well .",
    "in addition , we have introduced a new technique for probing the density evolution in the dipole trap during the evaporation process using photoassociation .",
    "this tool enables us to optimize the production of a bose - einstein condensate in a simple manner . under some conditions it also allows for non - destructive monitoring of the condensate evolution .",
    "the fixed - focus crossed - dipole trap technique is capable of generating multiple condensates simultaneously , which can be connected with each other via the dipole trap beams .",
    "the simple optical system allows for a great deal of flexibility in constructing experiments , and also provides good optical access to the system .",
    "the ability to produce multiple independent condensates suggests a number of interesting atom optics experiments where , for instance , one could collide or channel condensates in the waveguides provided by the trapping beams ."
