    "time - varying graphs have emerged as a useful model for networks with time - varying topology , especially in the context of communication networks .",
    "examples include vehicular ad hoc networks @xcite , space communication networks @xcite , mobile sensor networks @xcite , whitespace networks @xcite and millimeter - wave ( mmwave ) networks @xcite . in figure",
    "[ snap ] , we illustrate a simple time - varying graph and its snapshots over 3 time slots .    in many applications of time - varying networks ,",
    "transmission reliability is of a great concern .",
    "for example , it is critical to guarantee transmission reliability for vehicular networks that are often used to exchange traffic and emergency information ; it is also crucial to provide robustness against unexpected shadowing for mmwave networks @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , time - varying networks are particularly vulnerable due to their constantly changing topology that results from different kinds of interruptions .",
    "one type of interruptions are called _ intrinsic _ interruptions which originate from the inherent nature of the network , such as node mobility in vehicular networks . for certain types of networks ,",
    "such intrinsic interruptions are often _",
    "predictable_. for example , it is easy to predict the temporal patterns of topology for a time - varying network formed by either public buses @xcite or satellites @xcite which have fixed tours and schedules ; in low - duty - cycle sensor networks @xcite , the sleep / wake - up pattern is periodic and can be predicted accurately ; in whitespace networks , the states of secondary links in the next few hours can be known a prior by using the whitespace database @xcite ; a recent study @xcite also shows that human mobility has 93% potential predictability .",
    "in contrast , the other type of interruptions are _ extrinsic _ and _",
    "unpredictable_. for example , the predictions about the evolution of network topology are prone to errors and could be inaccurate due to various unforeseen factors such as unexpected obstacles and hardware malfunctions .",
    "these unpredictable disruptions may greatly degrade network performance and are referred to as * failures*. the goal of this paper is to understand the robustness of time - varying networks against unpredictable interruptions ( failures ) while treating those predictable interruptions as an inherent feature of the network .    due to the unpredictability of failures , it is desirable to evaluate the _ worst - case survivability_. in static networks , this is usually defined to be the ability to survive a certain number of failures as measured by the mincut of the graph .",
    "however , this definition is not effective in time - varying networks . by its very nature",
    ", a time - varying network may have different topologies at different instants , so its connectivity or survivability must be measured over a long time interval . to be more specific",
    ", we would like to highlight two important temporal features that are neglected by the traditional notion of survivability .",
    "first , failures have significantly different durations in a time - varying network .",
    "for example , an unexpected obstacle may only disable the link between two nodes for several seconds , after which the link reappears .",
    "in contrast , the traditional definition of survivability is intended for a static environment and fails to account for links reappearing .",
    "the duration of failures has a crucial impact on the performance of time - varying networks ; for example , in the time - varying network shown in figure [ snap ] , an one - slot failure of any link can not separate node @xmath1 and node @xmath2 while a two - slot failure ( i.e. , a failure that spans two consecutive slots ) can disconnect @xmath2 from @xmath1 by disabling link @xmath3 in the first two slots .",
    "second , failures may occur at different instants .",
    "this feature is obscured in static networks but has a great influence on time - varying networks due to their changing connectivity .",
    "for example , if a two - slot failure occurs to link @xmath3 at the beginning of slot 2 , node @xmath2 is still reachable from node @xmath1 within the three slots ; however , if the two - slot failure happens at the beginning of slot 1 , there is no way to travel from @xmath1 to @xmath2 within the three slots .    to handle the above non - trivial temporal factors ,",
    "we propose a new survivability framework for time - varying networks .",
    "our framework captures both the _ number _ and the _ duration _ of failures .",
    "the contributions of this paper are in the following four areas :    @xmath4 * model . *",
    "we propose a new survivability framework , i.e. , @xmath5-survivability , where the values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 characterize the number and the duration of failures the network can tolerate .",
    "moreover , by tuning the two parameters , our framework can generalize many existing survivability models .",
    "we further propose two metrics , namely @xmath8 and @xmath9 , in order to assess robustness in time - varying networks .",
    "@xmath4 * theory .",
    "* we provide new graph - theoretic results that highlight the difference between static and time - varying graphs .",
    "for example , we show that some fundamental survivability - related results such as menger s theorem only conditionally hold in time - varying graphs .",
    "@xmath4 * computation .",
    "* due to the difference between static and time - varying graphs , the evaluation of survivability becomes very challenging in time - varying networks .",
    "we analyze the complexity of computing the proposed survivability metrics and develop efficient approximation algorithms .",
    "@xmath4 * application . *",
    "we conduct trace - driven simulations to demonstrate the application of our framework in a real - world communication network used in a public transportation system .",
    "it is shown that our survivability framework has strong modeling power and is more suitable for time - varying networks than existing approaches .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ graph_model ] ,",
    "we formalize the model of time - varying graphs . in section [ survive_model",
    "] , the new survivability framework and its associated metrics are introduced . in section [ comp ] , we investigate some computational issues in the proposed framework . in section [ app1 ] ,",
    "trace - driven simulations are conducted to demonstrate the application of our framework in a real - world bus communication network .",
    "finally , related work and conclusions are given in sections [ related_works ] and [ conclusion ] , respectively .",
    "in this section , we formalize the model of time - varying graphs and introduce some important terminology and assumptions that will be frequently used throughout the paper .",
    "a useful tool for transforming time - varying graphs is also introduced .",
    "time - varying graphs are a high - level abstraction for networks with time - varying connectivity .",
    "the formal definition , first proposed in @xcite , is as follows .",
    "[ def_time ] a time varying graph @xmath10 has the following components : + ( i ) underlying ( static ) digraph @xmath11 ; + ( ii ) time span @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the time domain ; + ( iii ) edge - presence function @xmath14 , indicating whether a given edge is active at a given instant ; + ( iv ) edge - delay function @xmath15 , indicating the time spent on crossing a given edge at a given instant .",
    "this model can be naturally extended by adding a node - presence function and a node - delay function .",
    "however , it is trivial to transform node - related functions to edge - related functions by the technique called node splitting ( see @xcite , chapter 7.2 ) ; thus , it suffices to consider the above edge - version characterization .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a _",
    "discrete and finite _ time span , i.e. , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a bounded integer indicating the time horizon of interests , measured in the number of slots . in practice",
    ", @xmath17 may have different physical meanings .",
    "for instance , it may refer to the deadline of packets or delay tolerance in delay - tolerant networks ; it may also correspond to the period of a network whose topology varies periodically ( e.g. , satellite networks with periodical orbits ) .",
    "the slot length of a time - varying graph is arbitrary as long as it can capture topology changes in sufficient granularity . under the discrete - time model ,",
    "the edge - delay function @xmath18 can take values from @xmath19 .",
    "note that _ zero _ delay means that the time used for crossing an edge is negligible as compared to the slot length . throughout the rest of this paper",
    ", we consider the case where edge delay is one slot , i.e. , @xmath20 for any @xmath21 and @xmath22 , however , it is trivial to extend the analysis to arbitrary traversal time .",
    "the edge - presence function @xmath23 indicates the _ predictable _ topology changes in a time - varying network .",
    "examples of such predictable topology changes include those in a space communication network with known orbits@xcite , in a mobile social network consisting of students who share fixed class schedules@xcite , in a low - duty - cycle sensor network with periodic sleep / wake - up patterns @xcite , in a whitespace network with planned channel reclamation@xcite , in a mmwave network with scheduled beam steering@xcite , etc .",
    "in contrast , _ unpredictable _ topology changes ( also referred to as * failures * in this paper ) include those caused by unexpected shadowing , unscheduled channel reclamation , hardware malfunctions , etc .",
    "note that this model does not require perfect predictions of future topology changes since any prediction errors can be treated as failures .",
    "there exists a contact from node @xmath24 to node @xmath25 in time slot @xmath26 if @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this contact is denoted by @xmath29 or @xmath30 .",

    "a journey from node @xmath32 to node @xmath33 is a sequence of contacts : @xmath34 such that for any @xmath35 + ( i ) @xmath36 , @xmath37 ; + ( ii ) @xmath38 ; + ( iii ) @xmath39 ; + ( iv ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "intuitively , a journey is just a  time - respecting \" path .",
    "conditions ( i)-(ii ) mean that intermediate edges used by a journey are spatially connected .",
    "condition ( iii ) requires that intermediate edges remain active when traversed .",
    "condition ( iv ) indicates that the usage of intermediate edges must respect time and the journey should be completed before the time horizon @xmath17 .",
    "for example , there exists a journey from @xmath1 to @xmath2 in figure [ snap ] : @xmath42 when @xmath43 .    node @xmath33 is reachable from node @xmath32 if there is a journey from @xmath32 to @xmath33 .",
    "intuitively , reachability can be regarded as  temporal connectivity \" which indicates whether two nodes can communicate within @xmath17 slots .",
    "for example , node @xmath2 is reachable from node @xmath1 in figure [ snap ] , meaning that a message from @xmath1 can reach @xmath2 within @xmath43 slots .",
    "a line graph is a useful tool which allows us to transform a time - varying graph into a static graph that preserves the original reachability information .",
    "readers may temporarily skip the details and revisit this section when necessary .",
    "the transformation uses a similar idea to the classical _ line graph _ @xcite which illustrates the adjacency between edges .",
    "the difference here is that we also need to consider the temporal features of time - varying graphs . given a time - varying graph @xmath44 with source @xmath32 and destination @xmath33 , its line graph @xmath45 is constructed as follows .",
    "* for each contact @xmath29 in the original time - varying graph @xmath44 , create a corresponding node in the line graph ; the new node is denoted by @xmath46 . in addition , create a node for the source @xmath32 and a node for the destination @xmath33 , respectively .",

    "in this section , we begin to investigate the survivability properties of time - varying networks . specifically , we are interested in their resilience against _ unpredictable interruptions _",
    "( i.e. , failures ) such as unexpected shadowing , hardware malfunctions , etc .",
    "we first develop a new survivability model for time - varying networks .",
    "next , several metrics are introduced to evaluate survivability under the new model .",
    "finally , we present some graph - theoretic results regarding these metrics , which highlights the key difference between time - varying and static networks . in particular , we will show that some fundamental survivability - related results in static networks , such as menger s theorem , only conditionally hold in time - varying networks .",
    "such a difference makes it challenging to evaluate survivability in a time - varying network .      in static networks , the _ worst - case _ survivability is usually defined to be the ability to survive a certain number of failures wherever these failures occur .",
    "this definition is still feasible but very ineffective in time - varying networks because it fails to capture many temporal features of failures ( e.g. , duration and instant of occurrence ) .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , these temporal features have significant impacts on time - varying networks .",
    "hence , we extend the survivability model in order to account for these temporal effects and propose the concept of @xmath59-survivability .",
    "we first define @xmath5-survivability _ for a given source - destination pair _ ,",
    "i.e. , pairwise @xmath5-survivability .",
    "[ local_def ] in a time - varying graph @xmath44 , a source - destination pair @xmath60 is @xmath5-survivable if @xmath33 is still reachable from @xmath32 after the occurrence of any @xmath6 failures , with each failure lasting for at most @xmath7 slots .",
    "we can further define global @xmath5-survivability .",
    "a time - varying network is @xmath5-survivable if all pairs of nodes are @xmath5-survivable .",
    "since it only takes @xmath61 to check all pairs of nodes , global @xmath5-survivability can be easily derived from pairwise @xmath5-survivability .",
    "therefore , we will focus on pairwise @xmath5-survivability for a given pair of nodes @xmath60 throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "* discussion : * the above definitions do not impose any assumption about _ when _ and _ where _ the @xmath6 failures occur and thus imply the _ worst - case _ survivability .",
    "in other words , @xmath5-survivability means the network can survive @xmath6 failures that last for @xmath7 slots _ wherever _ and _ whenever _ these failures occur .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 reflects  spatial survivability \" , indicating _ how many _ failures the network can survive , and the parameter @xmath7 reflects  temporal survivability \" , indicating _ how long _ these failures can last .",
    "note also that @xmath5-survivability is a generalized definition .",
    "for example , if @xmath7 = @xmath17 ( note that @xmath17 is the time horizon ) , then @xmath5-survivability reflects the number of _ permanent failures _ the network can tolerate , which becomes the conventional notion of survivability used in static networks .",
    "finally , it should be mentioned that failures can be either link failures or node failures .",
    "since node failures can be converted to link failures by node splitting ( see @xcite , chapter 7.2 ) , we will consider link failures unless otherwise stated .",
    "in static networks , two commonly - used survivability metrics are : mincut , i.e. , the minimum number of edges whose deletion can separate the source and the destination , and maxflow , i.e. , the maximum number of edge - disjoint paths from the source to the destination . if mincut ( or maxflow ) equals to @xmath6 , the destination is still connected to the source after any @xmath62 link failures . however , by its very nature , a time - varying network has different topologies at different instants , so its connectivity or survivability must be measured over a long time interval and these static metrics can not be directly applied to time - varying networks . in this section ,",
    "we introduce two new metrics for @xmath5-survivability . the fundamental relationship between the two metrics",
    "will be further discussed in section [ ana_metrics ] .",
    "_ * 1 ) survivability metric : @xmath63 * _    before we proceed to the first survivability metric , it is necessary to introduce the notions of @xmath7-removal and @xmath7-cut .",
    "a @xmath7-removal is the deletion of a link for @xmath7 consecutive time slots .",
    "intuitively , a @xmath7-removal just corresponds to a link failure that lasts for @xmath7 consecutive time slots .",
    "a @xmath7-cut is a set of @xmath7-removals that can render the destination unreachable from the source .",
    "the above definition is similar to the traditional notion of graph cuts except that @xmath7-cuts also account for the duration of removals .",
    "now we are ready to introduce the first metric for @xmath5-survivability , namely @xmath8 .",
    "this metric directly follows from the definition of @xmath5-survivability and is analogous to mincut in static networks .",
    "[ mincut_def ] @xmath8 is the cardinality of the smallest @xmath7-cut , i.e. , the minimum number of @xmath7-removals needed to render the destination unreachable from the source .",
    "* discussion . * first , @xmath8 gives the minimum number of @xmath7-removals required to disconnect the time - varying network .",
    "in particular , when @xmath64 , the source - destination pair can safely survive any @xmath62 failures that last for @xmath7 slots and is thus @xmath65-survivable .",
    "second , @xmath8 generalizes mincut in static networks since we can simply set @xmath7 = @xmath17 such that a @xmath7-removal becomes a permanent link removal .",
    "* formulation .",
    "* @xmath8 corresponds to the following integer linear programming ( ilp ) problem : @xmath66 here , @xmath67 is a binary variable indicating whether a @xmath7-removal occurs to edge @xmath68 in slot @xmath26 , and @xmath69 is the set of contacts in the time - varying graph .",
    "@xmath70 is the set of feasible journeys from @xmath32 to @xmath33 . for any @xmath71",
    ", we define @xmath72 as the set of contacts @xmath73 such that if @xmath74 then journey @xmath75 will be disrupted , i.e. , @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the set of contacts used by journey @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the first constraint in the above ilp forces every journey from @xmath32 to @xmath33 to be disrupted by at least one of the selected @xmath7-removals , such that @xmath33 is not reachable from @xmath32 .",
    "the above formulation is concise but has an exponential number of constraints because the number of possible journeys is exponential in the number of contacts .",
    "there also exists a compact ilp formulation which is less intuitive and omitted here for brevity . the complexity and the algorithm for solving the above ilp",
    "will be further discussed in section [ com_mincut ] .    _ * 2 ) survivability metric : @xmath78 * _    the second survivability metric , namely @xmath79 , is analogous to maxflow in static networks . before the detailed definition of this metric ,",
    "we first introduce the notion of @xmath7-disjoint journeys .",
    "a set of journeys from the source to the destination are @xmath7-disjoint if any two of these journeys do not use the same edge within @xmath7 time slots .",
    "mathematically , suppose @xmath80 is a set of @xmath7-disjoint journeys .",
    "for any two journeys @xmath81 , if edge @xmath68 is used by @xmath82 in slot @xmath26 , then @xmath83 can not use the same edge @xmath68 from slot @xmath84 to slot @xmath85 .",
    "in other words , sliding a window of @xmath7 slots over time , we can observe at most one active journey over each edge within the window .",
    "figure [ disjoint_example ] gives an example of @xmath7-disjoint journeys for the cases where @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "-disjoint journeys .",
    "the source - destination pair is @xmath88 .",
    "( a ) when @xmath86 , any two different @xmath7-disjoint journeys can not use the same link within the same slot , and there are three @xmath7-disjoint journeys .",
    "( b ) when @xmath87 , only two @xmath7-disjoint journeys exist since any link can not be used by two @xmath7-disjoint journeys within 2 slots .",
    "for example , link @xmath3 has been used by journey 2 in slot 1 , so any other @xmath7-disjoint journey can not use this link in slot 1 or 2.,width=307 ]    it is easy to see that each one of the @xmath7-disjoint journeys keeps a",
    " temporal distance \" of @xmath7 slots from others . due to the temporal distance , any failure that lasts for @xmath7 slots can influence at most one of these @xmath7-disjoint journeys .",
    "consequently , the maximum number of @xmath7-disjoint journeys in a time - varying network is a good indicator of its survivability .",
    "the more @xmath7-disjoint journeys there exist , the more failures ( lasting for @xmath7 slots ) the network can survive . now it is natural to introduce the second survivability metric @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath9 is the maximum number of @xmath7-disjoint journeys from the source to the destination .",
    "* discussion . *",
    "first , we would like to compare maxflow ( for static networks ) and @xmath9 ( for time - varying networks ) .",
    "maxflow considers disjoint paths which require _ spatial disjointness _",
    ", i.e. , any two disjoint paths never use the same link .",
    "this requirement is too demanding for time - varying networks because such networks often have sparse spatial connectivity . in the example of bus communication networks ( see section [ app1 ] ) , we will see that a time - varying network may not have any spatially - disjoint paths .",
    "thus , maxflow is not an appropriate metric for time - varying networks . by comparison",
    ", @xmath9 considers @xmath7-disjoint journeys , which allows for _ temporal disjointness_. moreover , @xmath9 generalizes maxflow since we can simply set @xmath7 = @xmath17 so that @xmath7-disjoint journeys become spatially disjoint .",

    "the first constraint checks every edge and forces this edge to be used by at most one of the @xmath7-disjoint journeys in any time window of @xmath7 slots .",
    "the above formulation also has an exponential number of constraints .",
    "a compact formulation also exists but is omitted for brevity .",
    "the complexity and the algorithms for solving the above ilp will be further investigated in section [ com_maxflow ] .",

    "in this section , we demonstrate how to use our survivability framework to facilitate the design of robust networks in practice . to be more specific , we exploit @xmath7-disjoint journeys to design a _ survivable routing _",
    "protocol for a real - world bus communication network @xcite .",
    "each bus in the network has a pre - designed route and is equipped with an 802.11 radio that constantly scans for other buses .",
    "since the route of each bus is designed in advance , we can make a _ coarse prediction _ about bus mobility and the evolution of their communication topology . as a result",
    ", we can convert this bus communication network into a time - varying graph whose topology changes according to the estimated bus mobility .",
    "however , the prediction may not be perfect due to various reasons such as unexpected obstacles , traffic accidents , traffic jam , etc .",
    "the goal of survivable routing is to reduce the packet loss rate due to these unpredictable failures .    in the rest of this section",
    ", we first present the design of the survivable routing protocol using @xmath7-disjoint journeys .",
    "then we discuss trace statistics , simulation settings and results .",
    "the basic idea of this protocol is to replicate each packet at the source and send these copies along multiple @xmath7-disjoint journeys obtained by solving @xmath7-maxflow .",
    "when at least one of these copies reaches the destination , the original packet is successfully delivered .",
    "this replication - based protocol is referred to as disjoint - journey routing ( djr ) .",
    "the advantages of djr over other reliable routing protocols are as follows .",
    "@xmath4 _ simplicity of deployment in time - varying networks .",
    "_ static networks usually deploy arq at the data link layer and tcp at the transport layer for error recovery . however , due to the lack of connectivity , it is not only difficult to get timely ack at the sender but also hard to find opportunities for retransmissions .",
    "in contrast , djr does not require any feedback , which greatly simplifies the data link layer and the transport layer ( no need for error recovery ) .",
    "in addition , as a network - layer protocol , it can be combined with fec codes at the physical layer ( e.g. , erasure code @xcite ) to achieve a better performance .",
    "@xmath4 _ temporal diversity .",
    "_ traditional survivable routing protocols rely on spatial diversity , such as disjoint - path routing ( dpr ) @xcite@xcite , where spatially - disjoint paths are used to recover packets .",
    "however , spatial diversity is a demanding requirement in networks with sparse and intermittent connectivity . we will demonstrate that it is hard to find even two spatially - disjoint paths in the bus network . by comparison",
    ", djr exploits temporal diversity to combat failures and is well suited for time - varying networks , especially when failures are transient .",
    "@xmath4 _ two - dimensional tunability . _",
    "our survivability framework has two natural parameters , namely @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "hence , the tunability of djr is also in two dimensions : we can both tune the number of @xmath7-disjoint journeys to use , and also adapt the degree of temporal disjointness . by comparison , existing survivable routing protocols ( e.g. , @xcite ) lack such flexibility .",
    "we use the trace from umassdieselnet @xcite where a public bus transportation system was operated around amherst , massachusetts .",
    "the trace records the contacts among 21 buses in 9 days , which roughly reflects bus mobility over the pre - designed bus routes .",
    "we use such contact information as a coarse prediction for the states of bus - to - bus links in the 9-day period .",
    "however , we assume that the prediction is imperfect and unpredictable failures may disable these contacts ( the failure model will be introduced in the next section ) .    to facilitate our subsequent discussion ,",
    "we pre - process the raw trace and observe two important features of this bus communication network .",
    "the first observation is the  bursty \" structure of contacts between any two buses ; that is , buses only communicate with each other occasionally .",
    "figure [ trace_stat](a ) illustrates such a bursty structure for a typical pair of buses .",
    "the second observation is that most connections in this network last for only a short period of time .",
    "as is shown in figure [ trace_stat](b ) , most contacts span less than 20s .          in our simulation ,",
    "the slot length is identical to the trace resolution , i.e. , one second .",
    "according to the measurement in @xcite , the average transmission rate is about 1.64mbps .",
    "if the packet size is set to be 1 kb , the transmission time of one packet is nearly negligible as compared to the slot length , which implies zero link - traversal delay .",
    "each packet has a deadline ( ddl ) after which it will be dropped from the network ; naturally , the packet deadline can be modeled by the time horizon @xmath17 of the corresponding time - varying graph .",
    "a packets is generated between a random source - destination pair immediately after the previous packet expires or gets delivered .",
    "in addition , at most @xmath6 copies are allowed , meaning that we can use at most @xmath6 @xmath7-disjoint journeys to send these copies .",
    "algorithm [ alg_maxflow1 ] is used to compute @xmath7-disjoint journeys .",
    "since it is impossible to precisely predict future topology changes , we impose random failures on the time - varying graph generated from the trace . for each link",
    ", we let failures occur in each slot with a certain probability @xmath130 , and the duration of each failure is uniformly distributed within @xmath131 $ ] seconds .",
    "the performance metric is the packet loss rate , i.e. , the fraction of packets that fail to reach the destination before the deadline .",
    "we first look at the maximum number of @xmath7-disjoint journeys in the bus communication network ( figure [ bus1 ] ) .",
    "first , it can be observed that there exist very few @xmath7-disjoint journeys in this network : less than three @xmath7-disjoint journeys when @xmath133 .",
    "particularly , only one @xmath7-disjoint journey exists when @xmath7 is relatively large , which means that it is almost impossible to find even two journeys that are spatially disjoint ( i.e. , @xmath134 ) .",
    "this observation indicates the lack of spatial connectivity in this bus network and implies the inefficiency of traditional disjoint - path routing in networks with intermittent connectivity since such a protocol only relies on spatial diversity .",
    "second , we can observe the diminishing return for the number of @xmath7-disjoint journeys : beyond a certain value of @xmath7 , the increase of @xmath7 no longer reduces the number of @xmath7-disjoint journeys .",
    "such a tendency is due to the bursty contact structure in this network ( see section [ tr_stat ] ) .",
    "the final observation is that extending the packet deadline increases the total number of @xmath7-disjoint journeys since there are more transmission opportunities within a longer deadline .",
    "-disjoint journeys in the network.,width=240 ]      next , we study the two - dimensional tunability of djr ( figure [ bus2 ] ) .",
    "we first investigate the tunability of @xmath6 , i.e. , the maximum number of copies we are allowed to produce or the maximum number of @xmath7-disjoint journeys we can use . if we are allowed to use only one of the @xmath7-disjoint journeys ( @xmath135 ) , djr is ineffective and the packet loss rate remains at a high level regardless of the value of @xmath7 .",
    "if we can use more @xmath7-disjoint journeys , the packet loss rate is significantly reduced ( of course , more redundant copies are created ) .",
    "the influence of @xmath7 is more interesting . with the increase of @xmath7 ,",
    "the packet loss rate first goes down and then increases ; this tendency can be explained as follows .",
    "when @xmath7 is small , there exist many @xmath7-disjoint journeys and we can choose any @xmath6 of them to transmit copies of packets . with a fixed number of disjoint journeys , it is known that larger temporal disjointness makes the network more robust since it can survive failures of longer duration .",
    "hence , the packet loss rate first goes down .",
    "however , the increase of @xmath7 also leads to the reduction in the number of @xmath7-disjoint journeys ( see figure [ bus1 ] ) ; beyond a certain value of @xmath7 , the number of @xmath7-disjoint journeys becomes smaller than @xmath6 and we have to send copies over fewer than @xmath6 disjoint journeys , which means that the network can survive fewer failures .",
    "therefore , although temporal disjointness continues to grow , the reduction in the number of available disjoint journeys makes the loss rate increase .",
    "moreover , we can observe that there exists an  optimal \" value of @xmath7 which minimizes the packet loss rate ( highlighted by shaded circles ) .",
    "in fact , this optimal value is the maximum @xmath7 such that @xmath136 .     and @xmath7 on packet loss rates ( ddl=300s , @xmath130=0.05 , @xmath33=60s).,width=220 ]",

    "@xcite studied a related but different problem in time - varying networks ; specifically , they proposed heuristic algorithms to find the the min - cost subgraph of a probabilistic time - varying graph such that the probability that the subgraph is temporally connected exceeds a certain threshold .",

    "the primary goal of dtn is to improve the packet delivery ratio via some routing schemes , and there is extensive literature in this area , such as @xcite .",

    "we also assume that there are no isolated nodes in @xmath169 .",
    "these assumptions do not change the complexity of bledp because we can simply remove these isolated nodes or long edges from @xmath169 without any influence on the optimal solution .",
    "the high - level idea of the reduction is to transform the  spatial length bound \" into a  temporal length bound \" .",
    "note that in our model , a natural temporal bound @xmath17 exists so we set @xmath171 .",
    "in addition , we also need to make sure that whenever edge @xmath68 is crossed , a  temporal distance \" of @xmath167 slots is traversed .",
    "since it is assumed that edge - traversal delay is one time slot , we can expand each edge in series such that extra delay is incurred . to be more specific ,",

    "if the the destination is unreachable from the source , both the optimal solution and the greedy algorithm will yield a result of zero , where no approximation gaps exist .",

    "a short path consists of at most @xmath117 nodes while a long path is made up of more than @xmath117 nodes .",

    "then we prove that the number of short journey in @xmath178 is at most @xmath182 .",
    "to show this point , we first prove that each short journey ( say @xmath183 ) in @xmath178 is interfered by some short journey ( say @xmath184 ) in @xmath80 ( i.e. , @xmath185 and @xmath184 use the same edge within @xmath7 slots ) .",

    "we make two simple observations regarding the weights .",
    "the first is that @xmath194 since @xmath195 .",
    "the second is that the sum of weights that can be removed by one @xmath7-removal is less or equals to 1 .",
