    "rest - frame uv selection offers a prime view into populations of star - forming galaxies at @xmath8 .",
    "first used to identify @xmath9 galaxies with sharp breaks in their spectral energy distributions due to absorption below the lyman limit @xcite , the lyman break technique has now been modified and extended to both lower and higher redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the development of the technique in the 1990s , thousands of star - forming galaxies have been spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , resulting in a revolution in our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "however , these high - redshift galaxies suffer from a fundamental problem : they are typically small and faint , with @xmath11mag , making it impossible to carry out detailed studies of individual objects unless they happen to be strongly lensed . in particular",
    ", this limitation applies to observations of uv - bright star - forming systems at the long wavelengths that can trace star formation even in highly obscured regions .",
    "while stacking analyses of large samples confirm that uv - selected galaxies at @xmath3 have substantial fractions of their bolometric luminosities emerging in the far - infrared , with @xmath12 @xcite , understanding the parameters of obscured star formation in individual unlensed objects remains out of reach for current facilities .",
    "the first bright lensed lyman break galaxies , `` cb58 '' ( i.e. , ms1512-cb58 ) and the `` cosmic eye '' ( i.e. , lbgj213512.73@xmath13010143 ) , were discovered serendipitously in the course of a cluster redshift survey @xcite and a _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) snapshot imaging survey of x - ray - bright clusters @xcite , respectively . since clusters are rich in strong caustics capable of producing fold arcs ( like cb58 ) and in individual galaxies capable of producing nearly complete einstein rings ( like the cosmic eye ) , the circumstances of these discoveries were not surprising .",
    "more recently , however , several teams have begun to exploit the enormous footprint of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to identify uv - bright high - redshift sources that are lensed by individual galaxies in field or group environments .",
    "this enterprise kicked off with the serendipitous discovery of the `` 8 oclock arc '' @xcite and has now spawned a variety of systematic searches within the sdss object catalog that rely on different selection criteria ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . by focusing on luminous red galaxies with multiple blue neighbors , and on close pairs with characteristic lens+arc morphologies , various authors of this paper",
    "have now contributed to the discovery of 11 new spectroscopically confirmed lenses at redshifts @xmath14 @xcite .    in this paper , we present _",

    "we defer to future papers analysis of _ spitzer_/irac and ( for j1206 ) mips imaging of these targets in light of more refined _ hst_-based lens models , together with detailed comparisons to the source - plane properties of similar lensed star - forming galaxies @xcite and high - redshift systems selected through their dust emission rather than rest - uv colors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", we followed the recommendations of @xcite and mapped the targets at six positions across the slit .",
    "observations of j1206 were taken during _ spitzer _",
    "cycle 4 ( pid 40430 ; pi s. allam ) on 2007 december 1920 , and consisted of @xmath24 pointings in ll1 and ll2 for total integration times of 2.1ks and 2.2ks , respectively .",

    ".    data reduction relied on standard analysis packages and followed the procedure described by @xcite . using iraf",
    ", we removed latent charge in the irs images row - by - row by fitting the linear background increase over time .",
    "subsequently , we masked `` rogue '' pixels using the idl routine irsclean .",
    "after cleaning , we constructed sky images for each target position using the five other pointings from the same mapping aor .",
    "the resulting sky images were subtracted from the corresponding science frames , and the differences were then co - added to produce a final 2d spectrum at each position .",
    "we extracted 1d spectra using the spice package provided by the spitzer science center , using optimal extraction .",
    "we used an extraction aperture half the default size in order to avoid contamination from other sources ( see below ) , but we corrected to full - aperture fluxes using observations of standard stars .    for j0901 , extraction of the 1d spectra",
    "was complicated by an interloping source , sdssj090125.59 + 181427.8 ( see figure [ fig:0901data]a ) , lying @xmath26 away from the lens . from its irs spectrum , this object is likely to be a quasar at @xmath27 , in agreement with the assessment of its optical colors by @xcite .",
    "its spectrum in one pointing often lay on or near the position of a j0901 spectrum in _ another _ pointing ; combined with the fact that j0901 itself is bright and extended , this situation meant that a given `` sky '' frame included the true background , light from the interloping source , and residual flux from j0901 at other map positions , leading to oversubtraction in our final 2d spectra ( e.g. , figure [ fig:0901data]a ) . to correct for this effect , we extracted 1d spectra of the negative sky echoes at _ different _ locations in the 2d spectrum whose combination should have experienced the _",
    "same _ oversubtraction as the position in question ( e.g. , figure [ fig:0901data]b ) . by combining such measurements",
    ", we constructed an empirical model for the oversubtraction of each of our target spectra that accounted for both continuum and pah features .",
    "we found that the correction was fairly mild , leading to a @xmath28% flux increase over the uncorrected spectrum .",
    "as an alternative to the above procedure , we tried to create sky images using only dithers whose positions were far enough away that no oversubtraction occurred .",
    "doing so meant constructing sky images from many fewer frames , often from only one or two other positions .",
    "as a result , we found the reduced ( cleaned and sigma - clipped ) 2d spectra were affected by rogue pixels whose effects would otherwise have been eliminated .",
    "such pixels not only increased the uncertainty in our final 1d spectrum , but also introduced small - scale features that do not correspond with any known emission features . given the undesirable effects of this approach to sky subtraction , we opted for the method described above , which uses all of the original frames .",
    "we note that the spectra produced via our two sky subtraction procedures yield similar flux densities within the measurement uncertainties .    for both j1206 and j0901 , the error spectrum at each position",
    "was calculated using spice and standard deviation frames constructed in iraf .",
    "the final error spectrum is that of all the positions added in quadrature . for j0901 , we include an additional systematic uncertainty associated with our sky correction , raising the final error spectrum by a factor @xmath29 .",
    "figure [ fig:1206]a shows the extracted irs spectra for j1206 . on top of a rising continuum ,",
    "prominent pah features are present at 6.2 , 7.7 , and 11.3@xmath1 m .",
    "in addition , a strong [ ] feature is present at 10.5@xmath1 m . in order to compare the spectrum to those of local starbursting analogs , we fit template _ infrared space observatory _ spectra of 30 doradus , circinus , m82 ,",
    "ngc 253 , and ngc 1068 from , and the average _ spitzer _ starburst template from @xcite . for the fit",

    "we find that the spectrum is well fit by the m82 template ( @xmath33 ) , and marginally fit by the ngc253 and average starburst templates ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "in contrast , the other templates from ( for 30 doradus , circinus , and ngc1068 ) fit the spectrum poorly ( @xmath35 ) due to the lack of strong pah features . for each of the acceptable templates ,",
    "the best fit includes an additional , steeply - rising continuum with a power law index of @xmath36 .    exploiting the similarity to the spectrum of m82",
    ", we can estimate the far - ir luminosity of j1206 as @xmath37 in terms of the distance to m82 ( 3.63mpc : * ? ? ?",

    "this is precisely the value of @xmath31 delivered by our template fitting , leading to an estimate of @xmath43 that places j1206 in the lirg regime . in estimating @xmath44 we ignore the additional power - law component used in template fitting , since its contribution should be negligible at far - ir wavelengths .    to extract and interpret the features of the spectrum , we have also computed a fit using the drude profiles defined in @xcite for pah features , gaussian line profiles for ionized species expected to be strong , and a simple power law continuum ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "in addition , the fit includes extinction effects from 9.7 @xmath1 m silicate absorption .",
    "the results of this fit are plotted in figure [ fig:1206]c and tabulated in table [ tab : results ] . to assess the strength of the pah emission",
    ", we compare the rest - frame equivalent widths ( ews ) of the 6.2 , 7.7 ( @xmath46 ) , and 11.3 ( @xmath47 ) @xmath1 m pah features to those of local starbursting systems .",
    "comparisons of ews are known to be sensitive to the details of how authors define the underlying continuum .",
    "in particular , continuum levels are often defined by the values of the data seen on either side of emission features ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such definitions result in systematically higher continua and lower pah ews than found by comprehensive fits to the spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to facilitate interpretation of the ew values",
    "reported in table [ tab : results ] , we analyze the average starburst spectrum of @xcite using the same conventions as for j1206 .",
    "we find ews for the average starburst spectrum that are factors @xmath48 higher than derived by @xcite for their own data .",
    "nevertheless , this approach provides a consistent way of measuring and comparing ew values to our data .",
    "relative to the average starburst spectrum , j1206 has ews that are lower by factors of 1.2 , 1.5 , and 1.2 for the 6.2 , 7.7 , and 11.3@xmath1 m pah features , respectively .",
    "this slight deficiency is not surprising , given the additional power - law continuum preferred by our template fitting above .",
    "the two most striking features of the @xmath49@xmath1 m spectrum of j1206 are its steep underlying continuum and prominent [ ] emission . in high - resolution studies of local star - forming galaxies ,",
    "the latter line is fairly common and appears weakly in starbursts @xcite and ulirgs @xcite , but is much stronger in blue compact dwarfs ( bcds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at lower resolution",
    "this line is unresolved , and only the strongest emitters are detected ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . comparing the relative strengths of [ ] and pah emission of j1206 to those of local counterparts , we identify the two low - resolution mid - ir spectra of the starburst ngc1222 @xcite and the bcd ugc4274 @xcite as close analogs .    using the optical spectroscopy of @xcite for ngc1222 and @xcite for ugc4274 , we calculate the oxygen abundance in each galaxy using the @xmath50 and @xmath51 indicators calibrated by @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath52 and @xmath53 for ngc1222 and ugc4274 , respectively .",
    "for j1206 , @xcite use near - ir spectroscopy to find @xmath54 and @xmath55 , in good agreement with the putative local counterparts . given the consistency between the spectra and the oxygen abundances , modulo a factor @xmath56 uncertainty in the calibration of the optical diagnostics @xcite , we conclude that ngc1222 and ugc4274 have physical conditions similar to those of j1206 .",
    "in addition to oxygen abundances , we can consider the ratios of ionized sulfur and neon lines [ ] 10.5@xmath1m/[]18.7@xmath1 m and [ ] 15.6@xmath1m/[]12.8@xmath1 m for ngc1222 and ugc4274 .",
    "these quantities are well - known proxies for the hardness of the radiation field ( see figure 9 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is also a function of metallicity @xcite .",
    "the galaxies have similar ratios of [ ] / [ ] @xmath57 and [ ] / [ ] @xmath58 , and lie between lower excitation starbursts and higher excitation bcds on a [ ] / [ ] versus [ ] / [ ] excitation diagram @xcite , implying a moderately hard radiation field . using stellar models , @xcite estimate the hardness of the radiation in starbursts by relating [ ] / [ ] to the ratio of the infrared and lyman continuum luminosities ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "since ngc1222 and ugc4274 have higher [ ] / [ ] ratios than the @xcite sample , we extrapolate their results and find @xmath60 indicating a somewhat lower range than for their more typical starbursts ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "if present in j1206 , such hard radiation would cause significant heating of small dust grains and naturally explain the steep continuum in our irs spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] all lie outside of our spectral coverage , preventing definitive confirmation of this hypothesis .",
    "in j1206 , the apparent consistency between metallicity estimates based on rest - frame optical and ( via analogy with ngc1222 and ugc4274 ) infrared observations suggests that we are not seeing discrepancies of the sort seen in the most violent local mergers . for ulirgs ,",
    "abundances derived from optical line diagnostics ( even after careful extinction corrections ) are lower than those derived from mid - infrared spectra , likely because the former are depressed by inflows of metal - poor gas from the outskirts of progenitor disks @xcite while the latter reflect rapid local enrichment in the most deeply embedded star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "metallicities for j1206 appear internally consistent across both obscured and unobscured regions , suggesting a less traumatic recent history that is consistent with the system s relatively modest far - ir luminosity .",
    "our conclusions about the implied metallicity and excitation state of j1206 require a certain degree of caution .",
    "while in good agreement with optical measurements , our selection of local infrared analogs for j1206 is based mostly on our detection of a single line , [ ] , whose correlations with pah strength , metallicity , and spectral hardness may be uncertain by 30% or more @xcite .",
    "further , metallicities derived from the optical emission lines in ngc1222 and ugc4274 are themselves uncertain by a factor @xmath56 @xcite . nevertheless , the consistency ( within the measured uncertainties ) between the ir spectra of j1206 , ngc1222 , and ugc4274 , as well as the optical and ir properties of ngc1222 and ugc4274 , is encouraging , indicating that the three objects do manifest similar physical conditions . in the future ,",
    "more robust estimates of the metallicity and excitation properties of j1206 will be possible with measurements of additional emission lines over a wider spectral range .",
    "we can also consider the absence of other emission lines in our irs spectrum , which shows no significant ionic or molecular features other than [ ] . in table",
    "[ tab : results ] , we report @xmath62 upper limits on [ ] at 6.99@xmath1 m , [ ] at 8.99@xmath1 m , and [ ] at 7.65@xmath1 m . at first glance",
    ", it seems surprising we do not detect [ ] , given that it is commonly detected in starburst systems @xcite , including m82 and ngc253 .",
    "as discussed above , however , the presence of a rising continuum and [ ] emission imply higher excitation in j1206 than in average starbursting systems .",
    "given that the ionization potential of [ ] at 34.8 ev is a factor @xmath63 greater than [ ] at 15.8 ev , [ ] is likely weak because most of the argon is more highly ionized .",
    "this effect is seen in bcd galaxies , which are known to exhibit high excitation states @xcite . as a consistency check",
    ", we note that our upper limit for [ ] ( ionization potential : 27.6 ev ) implies a ratio of [ ] / [ ] that is consistent with values seen in local starbursts and bcds @xcite .    in principle , an alternative explanation for the steep continuum and [ ] emission in j1206 is the presence of an agn .",
    "indeed , seyfert 2 galaxies are known to show pah and [ ] features , and exhibit strong , rising continua due to heating of small dust grains . to address this concern ,",
    "we consider the diagnostics of to disentangle starburst vs. agn energetics .",
    "specifically , we use the flux ratio of 6.2@xmath1 m pah to @xmath64@xmath1 m continuum , which is lower ( higher ) for a larger ( smaller ) agn contribution to the infrared luminosity . for j1206 ,",
    "this ratio is @xmath65 , much larger than the @xmath66 values of agn - dominated galaxies like ngc1068 and similar to results for pdr - dominated systems like m82 and ngc520 , which have @xmath67 of the emission contributed by an agn ( see figures 5 and 6 in ) . reinforcing this conclusion , seyferts with similar [ ] and [ ]",
    "strengths have @xmath68 m pah ews that are @xmath69 lower than for j1206 @xcite .",
    "finally , j1206 has a ratio [ ] /[]@xmath70 ( @xmath62 ) , which is lower than that in any seyfert for which [ ] is detected .",
    "we conclude that nuclear activity plays little role in the mid - ir spectrum of j1206 .      using the reduction procedure outlined in section [ sec : obs ]",
    ", we have derived the final rest - frame spectrum for j0901 that is shown in figure [ fig:0901]a .",
    "following the same procedure as above , we fit the same starburst templates to the spectrum as in section 3.1 , with the results shown in table [ tab : templates ] . as for j1206 , we find that the spectrum is best fit by a scaled version of m82 ( @xmath71 ) , less well by ngc253 or the average starburst template of brandl et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ( @xmath72 , respectively ) , and poorly by the other sturm et al . templates ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "for the ngc253 and average starburst fits , the higher @xmath74 values originate from the enhanced 9.7 @xmath1 m silicate absorption in j0901 , which is not seen in the templates ( see figure [ fig:0901]b ) . in contrast to j1206 ,",
    "j0901 exhibits only weak evidence for additional power - law emission , with fits favoring a component that is negligible or has highly uncertain parameters .",
    "again ( as in section 3.1 ) exploiting the similarity to the spectrum of m82 , and adopting a lens magnification of @xmath75 ( a. west et al .",
    "2010 , in preparation ) , we estimate its intrinsic far - ir luminosity to be @xmath76 , placing it in the ulirg regime .    as for j1206",
    ", we simultaneously fit the spectrum with a combination of continuum and relevant pah features and atomic emission lines .",
    "we find the degree of inferred silicate absorption is degenerate with the contributions of weak pah emission features to the spectrum . in general , this degeneracy has little effect on the inferred pah emission , except in the relative contributions of the 11.23 and 11.33@xmath1 m lines to the 11.3@xmath1 m pah feature .",
    "in fact , the @xmath77 and blended 7.7@xmath1 m and 11.3@xmath1 m pah strengths are essentially unaffected .",
    "ultimately , we have opted to use solutions with higher silicate extinction , in agreement with the template fits above .",
    "we present the results of this fit in table [ tab : results ] and plot the results in figure [ fig:0901]c .",
    "the pah emission in j0901 is strong relative to local starbursts , with ews of each feature that are a factor @xmath78 times larger than the @xcite average values .",
    "the strengths of the 6.2 , 7.7 , and 11.3@xmath1 m pah features serve as common diagnostics of the driving mechanism(s ) for infrared emission in infrared - luminous galaxies . in particular , suppressed pah emission ( especially at shorter wavelengths ) is indicative of a significant agn contribution to the bolometric infrared luminosity .",
    "given the strength of the observed pah emission , coupled with the shallow continuum , we conclude that accretion plays a small role in the mid - ir properties of j0901 .",
    "however , @xcite examined the optical emission line ratios and found values of [ ] /h@xmath79 and [ ] /h@xmath80 indicative of an agn , consistent with the significant [ ] and weak [ ] and [ ] emission seen in the object s rest - uv spectrum @xcite .",
    "to assess this apparent contradiction , we consider the expected flux contribution to our mid - ir spectrum by an agn whose optical properties resemble those of j0901 . specifically , we treat [ ] 5007 emission as a proxy for agn strength and scale the @xmath81 template of ngc 1068 by the factor required to reduce the integrated [ ] flux of ngc 1068 @xcite to the @xcite value .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ fig:0901]c shows the corresponding contribution of the scaled ngc 1068 spectrum : roughly 57% and 35% of the continuum flux at 5 and 10@xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "this comparison demonstrates that reliance on rest - frame uv / optical measurements alone may provide a bolometrically unrepresentative picture of the physical properties of high - redshift systems .",
    "finally , we examine our irs spectrum of j0901 for ionic and molecular emission . here",
    "j0901 is quite unlike j1206 , showing [ ] but no [ ] emission .",
    "the ew of [ ] is similar to that in the average starburst spectrum of @xcite ( see figure [ fig:0901]b ) . as discussed above , [ ] is weaker for systems with high - excitation interstellar media .",
    "therefore , j0901 must be bathed in a softer radiation field than j1206 , reinforcing the conclusion that agn emission plays little role in the ir properties of the system . with our upper limit on [ ]",
    "we find [ ] /[]@xmath82 , which when combined with the argon excitation versus abundance relation from implies an abundance ratio of @xmath83 \\gtrsim 1.3 $ ] .",
    "assuming that argon abundance is a reliable tracer of the global metallicity , this implies @xmath84 for j0901 .",
    "while an intriguing result , we recommend caution in interpreting it given the large uncertainty ( factor @xmath63 ) in the relation and its reliance on a single ionic line whose measurement uncertainties are @xmath85 .",
    "we have obtained @xmath2/irs spectra of two @xmath86 uv - bright star - forming galaxies , that are magnified by strong gravitational lensing . at rest wavelengths of @xmath87@xmath1 m ,",
    "the spectra reveal strong pah emission at 6.2 , 7.7 , and 11.3@xmath1 m , indicating that these objects are undergoing intense star formation .",
    "the strength of the pah emission implies these objects have properties in line with those of local starbursting galaxies .",
    "we find this similarity to local starburst galaxies is confirmed by our empirical template fits , in which both galaxies are well fit by simple , rescaled versions of m82 . in detail , however , analysis of pah strengths and emission line and continuum diagnostics reveals disparate properties .",
    "we summarize our conclusions as follows :    1 .   in j1206",
    ", we find pah ews lower than those in the local starburst spectrum of @xcite , due to an enhanced power - law continuum .",
    "in contrast , j0901 exhibits pah ews that are factors 1.61.9 times larger than the local average .",
    "we detect significant [ ] emission in j1206 . by analogy with two local galaxies with similar mid - ir spectra , ngc1222 and ugc4274 , we infer a sub - solar metallicities of @xmath4 , in agreement with the published optical measurement @xcite .",
    "the consistency of the optical and infrared metallicity estimates suggests j1206 has not undergone a recent violent merger .",
    "considering the [ ] / [ ] and [ ] / [ ] ratios of the local objects , we argue that j1206 is characterized by a moderately hard radiation field , which naturally explains the steeply rising continuum and lack of [ ] emission .",
    "3 .   in j0901",
    ", we detect strong pah emission but no [ ] or significant rising continuum .",
    "these results indicate that the mid - ir properties of j0901 are consistent with purely starburst - driven energetics .",
    "this inference contrasts with the implications of optical spectroscopy , where emission line ratios show the presence of an agn ; however , scaling from the [ ] flux of a local agn implies the agn contributes @xmath88 of the mid - ir continuum .",
    "thus , from its rest - frame uv through ir properties , j0901 likely hosts a narrow - line agn whose ir emission is overwhelmed by that of its surrounding starburst .",
    "this analysis highlights the need for future ir studies of high - redshift objects if we are to determine their physical properties robustly .",
