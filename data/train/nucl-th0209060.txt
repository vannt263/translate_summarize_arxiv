    "change of bulk properties of nuclei under the presence of strange impurities , like the lambda hyperon ( @xmath0 ) , is an interesting subject in hypernuclear physics . since a @xmath0 does not suffer from pauli blocking , it can locate at the center of a nucleus , then the @xmath0 attracts surrounding nucleons ( the gluelike role of @xmath0 ) and makes the nucleus shrink .",
    "one might expect only a bit change of the size for most of the nuclei .",
    "however , significant shrinkage of hypernuclei size could be expected when a @xmath0 is added to loosely bound light nuclei such as @xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "recently , the experiment kek - ps e419 has found clear evidence for this shrinkage of hypernucleus @xmath6@xmath7 .    in order to obtain a more profound understanding of the gluelike role of strange impurities in nuclei ,",
    "it is necessary to consider other strange impurities , like the sigma ( @xmath8 ) and cascade ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the behavior of these hyperons in the nuclear medium as well as the hyperon - nucleus potential , is of particular importance for this study .",
    "however , the @xmath10-nucleus potential has been still unclear until more recently because experimental information is limited@xmath11 . for the sake of the improvement of this situation , a new experiment at kek",
    "is carried out to measure the inclusive ( @xmath12 ) spectrum , which is sensitive to the @xmath10-nucleus potential@xmath13 .",
    "the result shows that a strongly repulsive @xmath10-nucleus potential is required to reproduce the observed spectrum .",
    "so , we have reason to believe that @xmath10 hyperon does not have any gluelike role and can not make the nucleus shrink .",
    "next in mass are the @xmath2 and @xmath3 hyperons .",
    "experimental evidence suggests that @xmath1-nucleus potential is attractive @xmath14 .",
    "therefor we may only consider @xmath0- and @xmath1-hypernuclei in this work .",
    "our purposes are : ( i)to test the universality of the gluelike role of @xmath0 impurity in a variety of @xmath0-hypernuclei which may not be loosely bound light nuclei ; ( ii ) to see whether or not the @xmath0- and @xmath1-impurities behave the same , in view of the fact that both @xmath0- and @xmath1-nuclear potentials are attractive ; ( iii ) to predict the properties of the @xmath1-impurities in @xmath1-hypernuclei .",
    "to accomplish these , a standard approach to the subject is the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model , to which a brief description for the hypernuclei is given in sec.ii . in sec.iii , after testing the validity of force parameters used in the rmf model , systematic calculations are performed for @xmath0-hypernuclei and the universality of the gluelike role of @xmath0 impurity is revealed . in sec.iv , we provide the rmf results for @xmath1-hypernuclei and different effects of @xmath2 and @xmath3 on the nucleus are discussed .",
    "a brief summary and conclusions are drawn in sec.v .",
    "the relativistic mean - field model ( rmf ) has been used to describe nuclear matter , finite nuclei , and hypernuclei successfully . here , we start from a lagrangian density of the form @xmath15 where , @xmath16 , or @xmath2 , or @xmath3 , @xmath17 is the standard lagrangian of the rmf model @xmath18 where @xmath19 it involves nucleons ( @xmath20 ) , scalar @xmath21 mesons ( @xmath21 ) , vector @xmath22 mesons ( @xmath23 ) , vector isovector @xmath24 mesons ( @xmath25 ) , and the photon ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the scalar self - interaction @xmath27 are included , as well .",
    "the parametrization of the nucleonic sector ( nl - sh)are adopted from ref.@xcite , the properties of finite nuclei can be well described .",
    "the lagrangian density @xmath28 describes the hyperon @xmath29 and its couplings to mesonic fields includes the @xmath22-@xmath0 tensor coupling term @xmath30 since @xmath0 is neutral and isoscalar baryon , it doesnot couple with the @xmath24 mesons and the photon .",
    "we adopt the parametrization of @xmath0 sector from ref.@xcite : @xmath31 . using these coupling constants",
    ", the properties of @xmath0-hypernuclei can be well described@xmath32 .",
    "the lagrangian density @xmath33 describes the hyperon @xmath34 and its couplings to the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath24 mesonic fields and the photon field @xmath35 we fix the coupling constants of @xmath1 , say the one to the vector fields with the quark model ( su(6 ) symmetry ) , @xmath36 and those to the scalar field with the experimental information  the optical potential .",
    "it turns out that two coupling constants of @xmath1 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are strongly correlated because they are fixed by the depth of the @xmath1 potential @xmath39 in the saturation nuclear matter@xmath40 .",
    "but the experimental data on @xmath2-hypernuclei are very little .",
    "dover and gal@xmath41 analyzing old emulsion data on @xmath2 hypernuclei , conclude a nuclear potential well depth of @xmath42 mev .",
    "fukuda et al@xmath43 fit to the very low energy part of @xmath2 hypernuclear spectrum in the @xmath44 reaction in experiments e224 at kek , estimate the value of @xmath45 between @xmath46 and @xmath47 mev . recently , e885 at the ags @xmath14 indicates a potential depth of @xmath48 mev or less .",
    "so the depth @xmath45 of @xmath1 in nuclear matter is not well fixed on .",
    "we start from calculation of the single - particle energies for @xmath0 in @xmath0-hypernuclei within the framework of the rmf model with force parameters taken from ref.@xcite , and present the results in fig.1 .",
    "it can be seen that the results are in good agreement with the experimental data@xmath49 .",
    "very small spin - orbit splitting for @xmath0-hypernuclei are also observed .",
    "this shows the rmf theory with the parameter set used for the @xmath0-hyperonic sector is reliable for studying the effect of the @xmath0 impurity , and has a predicting ability .    in order to observe the universality of the gluelike role of the @xmath0 hyperon impurity ,",
    "an unified rmf calculation is needed and careful tests should be done .",
    "hence in our calculations typical hypernuclei between @xmath6 and @xmath50 are selected .",
    "our results are shown in table [ t1 ] , in which some results for medium and heavy hypernuclei have been given in our previous work@xmath51 . in the table , @xmath52 ( in mev ) is the binding energies per baryon , @xmath53 is the r.m.s .",
    "charge radius , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the calculated r.m.s .",
    "radii ( in fm ) of the hyperon ( @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) , neutron and proton , respectively . here",
    ", hyperon is at its @xmath57 configuration .",
    "the definition of these quantities can be found in ref.@xcite . for comparison , the results for normal nuclei are also given . from table",
    "[ t1 ] , it can be seen that for lighter @xmath0-hypernucleus , the size of the core nucleus in a hypernucleus is smaller than the core nucleus in free space ( i.e. , normal nucleus ) .",
    "although there are only a bit change in the core nucleus due to the presence of @xmath0 impurity .",
    "for instance , the r.m.s .",
    "radius @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) of the neutrons ( protons ) decreases from 2.32 fm ( 2.37 fm ) in @xmath4 to 2.25 fm ( 2.29 fm ) in @xmath6 .",
    "we also see from the table that the change of @xmath55 and @xmath56 gradually decreases with increasing mass number .",
    "the above rmf results reveal the universality of the shrinkage effect for @xmath0-hypernuclei , but not for @xmath1-hypernuclei .",
    "it is particular interesting to observe a quite different effect caused by @xmath1 hyperon impurity .",
    "in order to see whether or not there is the shrinkage effect of @xmath1-hypernuclei , we have carried out the standard rmf calculations for some @xmath2- and @xmath3-hypernuclei . due to insufficient experiment information on @xmath1-hypernuclei ,",
    "the @xmath1 potential well depth is relatively uncertain , values appearing in the literature range from about -30 to -10 mev .",
    "recent experiments with light nuclei suggest that the value lies on the less bound size of this range @xmath58 . however , it may be more deeply bound for heavy nuclei @xmath59 . as a result ,",
    "a number of values of the @xmath1 potential well depth @xmath45 for each hypernuclei are used to test the sensitivity of the position of @xmath1 single - particle energy levels to the potential depth . in fig.2 , we only present results of calculations for the nucleus zr with a comparison of the @xmath2 ( upper part ) and the @xmath3 ( lower part ) single - particle levels .",
    "it can be seen that the change of the potential well depth causes large change in the single - particle energies . as @xmath45 deeper , the single - particle energies of hyperon increase significantly , and the spin - orbit splitting has a little larger .",
    "we also see that the attractive coulomb interaction for @xmath2 leads to a considerable stronger binding of @xmath2 in nuclei when compared with @xmath60-hypernuclei . in fig.3",
    ", we give the @xmath2(upper part ) and @xmath3(lower part ) binding energies in the nuclei o , ca , zr , pb for @xmath61 and @xmath62 mev ( only the @xmath63 states are given ) .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) curves are the results for @xmath64mev .",
    "next let us go further into the question how the static properties of the @xmath1-hypernuclei are affected by the potential depth @xmath45 .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are at the 1@xmath65 state in hypernuclei .",
    "our rmf results are shown in table [ t2 ] with @xmath66 - 10 , -18 and -28 mev , respectively .",
    "as seen from the table [ t2 ] , with increasing depth @xmath67 from 10 mev to 28 mev , the binding energies per baryon ( @xmath52 ) become larger .",
    "we can see such an uncertainty of @xmath1 potential well depth gets clearly reflected in an important variation of the @xmath1 binding energies , as it is shown in figs . 2 and 3 and also of the binding energies per baryon ( @xmath52 ) , presented in table [ t2 ] .",
    "because of that , no firm conclusions can be drawn from the quoted values of @xmath52 .",
    "we can also notice that the charge radius and the r.m.s .",
    "radii of the @xmath1 hyperon , neutrons and protons become smaller with increasing potential well depth .",
    "note that the reduction of r.m.s .",
    "radius for the neutrons ( @xmath55 ) and protons ( @xmath56 ) is different . in the case of @xmath2-hypernuclei ,",
    "the reduction of the @xmath56 is faster than that of the @xmath55 . while in the case of @xmath3-hypernuclei ,",
    "the reduction of the @xmath56 is slower that that of the @xmath55 .",
    "thus the rmf model predicts that the proton and nutron distribution have different response to the potential depth @xmath68 for the @xmath2- and @xmath3-hypernuclei .",
    "now , we study whether the @xmath1 hyperon impurity has the gluelike role as the @xmath0 does .",
    "the results are shown in table [ t1 ] in the form @xmath69 , where the central values ( @xmath70 ) are the results obtained with the -18 mev @xmath1 potential well depth , while the extremes of the uncertainty interval @xmath71 and @xmath72 are obtained with @xmath66 - 10 mev and -28 mev , respectively .",
    "a similar presentation is used in table [ t3 ] ( where rho exchange is not considered , i.e. , @xmath73 ) . from table",
    "[ t1 ] , we find , by adding a @xmath2 hyperon to the nuclei , the r.m.s . radius of the neutrons become a little larger , while r.m.s",
    ". radius of the protons become much smaller , comparing with that in the normal nuclei .",
    "contrast to the situation of @xmath2-hypernuclei , by adding a @xmath3 hyperon , the r.m.s .",
    "radius of the protons become larger and that of the neutrons become smaller .",
    "this is different from the situation of adding a @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "we know that @xmath0 has a gluelike role , both the r.m.s .",
    "radii of the protons and neutrons become smaller when adding a @xmath0 .",
    "note that @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are different particles from proton and neutron , they are all not constrained by the pauli exclusion , it is obviously that the common explanation for the shrinkage does not suit the case of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "otherwise , both @xmath0 and @xmath3 hyperon are neutral , hence the origin of the above difference can not be attributed to the coulomb potential .",
    "there must be some other source that we do nt recognized .    to reach a better understanding of the different behavior of the @xmath74 and @xmath3 impurities in the nucleus",
    ", we make an inspection of their isospin .",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 have different third component of isospin , which may be responsible for their different behavior . the different third component of isospin works through the coupling of baryon with the @xmath24 mesons in the rmf model .",
    "we may imagine if the @xmath24 mesons couplings for @xmath2 and @xmath3 are omitted from the rmf calculation ( @xmath75 ) , the above mentioned different behavior of @xmath2 and @xmath3 shall disappear .",
    "after eliminating the contribution of the @xmath24 mesons , the rmf results are shown in table [ t3 ] , from which we find the r.m.s .",
    "radii of both the protons and neutrons reduce when adding a @xmath2 or @xmath3 hyperon to the normal nuclei , the same as the situation of adding a @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "we obtain the same nuclear shrinkage by @xmath2 and @xmath3 when ignoring the contribution of the @xmath24 mesons . from the interactive term of nucleons with the @xmath24 mesons",
    ", we can find : when adding a @xmath2 , the attractive force increases for the protons and the repulsive force increase for the neutrons , the situation is contrary to the above when adding a @xmath3 .",
    "that explains the above rmf results reasonably .",
    "so , we can conclude the @xmath24 mesons play an important role , and the different behavior of the @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 impurities is due to their different isospin .",
    "although the changes are small , the different response of @xmath56 and @xmath55 to @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be interesting to know what kind of properties the two - body @xmath76 interaction .",
    "probably the isospin @xmath77 interaction is attractively large , while the @xmath78 interaction is repulsive and small .",
    "although the r.m.s .",
    "radius is reduced only for one kind of nucleons , but the r.m.s radius of other kind of nucleons become larger , that is seems that the nuclei may even swell somewhat when adding a @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "that is very different from the nuclear shrinkage by @xmath0 .",
    "within the framework of the rmf theory , the @xmath0 single - particle energies was calculated and the results are in good agreement with the experiments for all of the hypernuclei considered .",
    "very small spin - orbit splitting for @xmath0-hypernuclei are observed , which is agreement with earlier phenomenological analysis . from the investigation of the effects of @xmath0 on the core nucleus",
    ", we obtain the shrinkage effect inducing by @xmath0 hyperon impurity , otherwise , we find other light and medium @xmath0-hypernuclei also have this shrinkage effect , i.e. , the gluelike role of @xmath0 impurity is universal .    for @xmath1-hypernuclei ,",
    "first , we study the effect of the potential well depth @xmath45 on the static properties of @xmath1-hypernuclei .",
    "we can see the uncertainty of @xmath1 potential well depth gets clearly reflected in an important variation of the @xmath1 binding energies , because of that , no firm conclusions can be drawn from the quoted @xmath1 binding energies and values of @xmath52 . in the @xmath2-hypernuclei , the reduction of r.m.s .",
    "radius of the protons is larger than the reduction of that of the neutrons , while in the @xmath3-hypernuclei , the reduction of r.m.s .",
    "radius of the neutrons are larger than that of the protons with the deeper potential well depth .",
    "the strength of the effect of @xmath45 on different nucleons is different in @xmath1-hypernuclei .",
    "the effect of @xmath45 on the hypernuclei decreases with the increasing of the atomic number .",
    "after that , we study the effect of the adding @xmath1 hyperon on the nuclear core , we find : by adding a @xmath2 hyperon to the nucleus , the r.m.s . radius of the neutrons become a little larger , while the r.m.s",
    ". radius of the protons become smaller , comparing with that in the normal nucleus , and the decrease of the r.m.s .",
    "radius of the protons is larger as the @xmath45 deeper . while when adding a @xmath3 hyperon , the r.m.s .",
    "radius of the protons become a little larger and that of the neutrons become smaller . although the r.m.s .",
    "radius is reduced only for one kind of nucleons , but the r.m.s radius of other kind of nucleons become larger , that is seems that the nuclei may even swell somewhat when adding a @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "that is very different from the nuclear shrinkage by @xmath0 .",
    "and we find the @xmath24 mesons play an important role , the different effect on the nuclear core by @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 is due to their different isospin .",
    "although the changes are small , the different response of @xmath56 and @xmath55 to @xmath2 and @xmath3 may be interesting to know what kind of properties of the two - body @xmath76 interaction .",
    "probably the isospin @xmath77 interaction is attractively large , while the @xmath78 interaction is repulsive and small .",
    "the present work only focuses on the pure @xmath0 and @xmath1 hypernuclei , the coupling between @xmath76 and @xmath79 channels in @xmath1 hypernuclei is nt taken into consideration .",
    "the physics of @xmath79 hypernuclei ( @xmath79 and @xmath76 mix up in a formalism of coupled channel ) and @xmath80 hypernuclei have attracted a lot of attention@xmath81 and are subject of current investigation , because of that , more reliable information on @xmath76 interaction and @xmath1-nucleus are desired .",
