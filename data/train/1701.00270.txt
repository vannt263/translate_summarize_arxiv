    "all physical phenomena take place in space and time . the theory of space and time ( in the absence of gravity ) is called the special theory of relativity .",

    "we therefore stick to pragmatic operational definitions :    _ time is what clocks measure .",
    "space is what measuring rods measure . _    in order to study and make conclusions about the properties of space and time we need an observer .",
    "a natural choice is an observer who moves freely ( the one who is free from any external influences ) .",
    "an observer is not a single person sitting at the origin of a rectangular coordinate grid .",
    "rather , it is a bunch of friends ( call it team @xmath0 ) equipped with identical clocks distributed throughout the grid who record the events happening at their respective locations .",
    "how do we know that this bunch of friends is free from any external influences ?",
    "we look around and make sure that nothing is pulling or pushing on any member of the bunch ; no strings , no springs , no ropes are attached to them .",
    "an even better way is to use a collection of `` floating - ball detectors '' ( fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] ) distributed throughout the grid @xcite .",
    "when detector balls are released , they should remain at rest inside their respective capsules . if any ball touches the touch - sensitive surface of the capsule , the frame is not inertial .    in the reference frame associated with a freely moving observer ( our rectangular coordinate grid ) , galileo s law of inertia is satisfied : a point mass , itself free from any external influences , moves with constant velocity . to be able to say what `` constant velocity '' really means , and thus to verify the law of inertia , we need to be able to measure distances and time intervals between events happening at _ different _ grid locations .",
    "( color online . ) a floating - ball inertial detector .",
    "after @xcite . ]",
    "it is pretty clear how to measure distances : the team simply uses its rectangular grid of rods .",
    "it is also clear how to measure time intervals at a particular location : the team member situated at that location simply looks at his respective clock .",
    "what s not so clear , however , is how the team measures time intervals between events that are _ spacially _ separated .    a confusion about measuring this kind of time intervals was going on for two hundred years or so , until one day einstein said : `` we need the notion of synchronized clocks !",
    "clock synchronization must be operationally defined . ''",
    "the idea that clock synchronization and , consequently , the notion of simultaneity of spacially separated events , has to be _ defined _ ( and not assumed _ apriori _ ) is the single most important idea of einstein s , the heart of special relativity .",
    "einstein proposed to use light pulses .",
    "the procedure then went like this :    in frame @xmath0 , consider two identical clocks equipped with light detectors , sitting some distance apart , at @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "consider another clock equipped with a light emitter at location @xmath3 which is half way between @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( we can verify that @xmath3 is indeed half way between @xmath1 and @xmath2 with the help of the grid of rods that had already been put in place when we constructed our frame @xmath0 ) .",
    "then , at some instant , emit two pulses from @xmath3 in opposite directions , and let those pulses arrive at @xmath1 and @xmath2 . if the clocks at @xmath1 and @xmath2 show same time when the pulses arrive then the clocks there are synchronized , _ by definition_.    the light pulses used in the synchronization procedure can be replaced with two identical balls initially sitting at @xmath3 and connected by a compressed spring .",
    "the spring is released ( say , the thread holding the spring is cut in the middle ) , the balls fly off in opposite directions towards @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively",
    ".    how do we know that the balls are identical ? because team @xmath0 made them in accordance with a specific manufacturing procedure .",
    "how do we know that all clocks at @xmath0 are identical ? because team @xmath0 made all of them in accordance with a specific manufacturing procedure .",
    "how do we know that a tic - toc of any clock sitting in frame @xmath0 corresponds to 1 second ?",
    "because team @xmath0 called a tic - toc of a clock made in accordance with the manufacturing procedure `` a second '' .    similarly , clocks in @xmath4 are regarded as identical and tick - tocking at 1 second intervals because in that frame all of the clocks were made in accordance with the same manufacturing procedure .",
    "now , how do we know that the manufacturing procedures in @xmath0 and @xmath4 are the same ?",
    "( say , how do we know that a swiss shop in frame @xmath0 makes watches the same way as its counterpart in frame @xmath4 ? ) hmm  .",

    "relativity principle ( boosts ; 3 parameters ) .",
    "einstein constructed his theory of relativity on the basis of ( 1 ) the principle of relativity ( laws of nature are the same in all inertial reference frames ) , and ( 2 ) the postulate of the constancy of the speed of light ( the speed of light measured by _ any _ inertial observer is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body ) .",
