    "<S> we also show how to extract level spacing , level broadening , and charging energy of an open quantum dot from a bias spectroscopy plot .    </S>",
    "<S> nanoscale josephson quantum dot junctions are intriguing devices showing several interesting physical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> supercurrent , andreev reflections , quasiparticle transport , and excess current have all been studied in junctions where a nanotube or nanowire constitute the quantum dot @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the interplay between these josephson junction related phenomena and correlations as the kondo effect @xcite and the 0-@xmath0 transition for more weakly coupled junctions has been explored @xcite . in this paper , we present experimental results in the strongly coupled regime for a josephson quantum dot junction realized in a carbon - nanotube . </S>",

    "<S> [ ] , we utilize a designed external circuit in order to control the phase fluctuations which enables us to infer the true magnitude of the critical current , @xmath1 , from the measurable critical current / switching current , @xmath2 , by a fitting procedure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 can significantly differ from @xmath1 as demonstrated previously for nanotube - based josephson junctions @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the superconductor - nanotube - superconductor junction is represented by a josephson element ( cross ) , a junction resistor @xmath5 , and a junction capacitor @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the josephson element has a current - phase relation , which we in the fitting procedure ( see below ) assume to be @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the phase difference between the two superconducting and @xmath1 the critical current . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sinusoidal form of this relation is not in general true and this may cause some inaccuracy in the determination of the critical current . in ref . </S>",

    "<S> we therefore expect the simpler relation also to be a reasonable approximation in the case of open dots ( which allows us to use the ivanchenko - zilberman relation in eq . ) . at sub - gap bias voltages @xmath5 accounts for current due to multiple andreev reflections and at higher bias </S>",
