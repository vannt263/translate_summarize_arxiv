    "in two recent publications we have studied pion photoproduction on the nucleon in the framework of fixed-@xmath0 dispersion relations  @xcite . in particular , we have concentrated on the threshold region in which the results can be compared to both precision data and predictions of baryon chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) . the dispersion relations ( drs ) are based on a set of 4 photoproduction amplitudes @xmath1 depending on energy and momentum transfer described by the lorentz invariant variables @xmath2 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "these relations are lorentz and gauge invariant by construction , and unitarity is implemented by constructing the real parts of the amplitudes from the imaginary ( absorptive ) parts via the dispersion integrals .",
    "the dispersive amplitudes for sub - threshold kinematics are regular functions in a region of small @xmath2 and @xmath0 values , and therefore they can be expanded in a power series about the origin of the mandelstam plane ( @xmath3 ) . comparing this series with the tree and loop contributions of relativistic baryon chpt  @xcite one can read off the required low - energy constants ( lecs ) of that field theory , which up to now have been fixed by resonance saturation models or fits to the threshold data . in our present work we use maid05  @xcite as input for the absorptive parts of the amplitudes , which are obtained over the full resonance region up to c.m .",
    "energies of w=2.2  gev by a global fit to the pion photoproduction data . with few exceptions",
    "the results compare favorably with the experimental data and the predictions of chpt in the threshold region .",
    "another interesting aspect is the comparison with sum rules and low - energy theorems ( lets ) of the 1950 s and 1960 s .",
    "these relations were based on current algebra and the pcac hypothesis ( partial conservation of the axial current ) .",
    "they become exact in the chiral limit of qcd , and thus all variables and observables have to be understood in the fictitious limit of vanishing ( light ) quark masses and hence soft pions with mass @xmath4 .",
    "this leads to an expansion of the amplitudes in the mass ratio @xmath5 .",
    "the first such theorem was established by kroll and ruderman  @xcite for charged pion photoproduction , with the result that the s - wave amplitude for this process was finite in the limit @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath7 .",
    "somewhat later , several authors derived a let for neutral pion photoproduction  @xcite , which led to the assumption that this reaction was @xmath8 for the proton and @xmath9 for the neutron .",
    "however , extensive investigations in chpt have shown that the finite pion mass leads to substantial corrections at physical threshold  @xcite .",
    "we have studied the role of such corrections in the context of two sum rules of fubini , furlan , and rossetti ( ffr )  @xcite .",
    "the first of these sum rules relates the nucleon s anomalous magnetic moment @xmath10 to a dispersion integral over the first pion photoproduction amplitude @xmath11 for neutral pions , or , if extended to electroproduction , the pauli form factor to the corresponding electroproduction amplitude .",
    "the second ffr sum rule predicts that the difference of the axial ( @xmath12 ) and the dirac vector ( @xmath13 ) form factors is related to the longitudinal electroproduction amplitude @xmath14 for charged pions .",
    "the radii of these form factors are of similar size , @xmath15 @xmath16 and the early estimates  @xcite simply led to the result @xmath17 .",
    "the first and to our knowledge only dispersive calculation was performed by adler and gilman already in 1966  @xcite .",
    "their result was @xmath18 @xmath19 , in fantastic agreement with our present knowledge of this observable .",
    "unfortunately , this result involves a dispersion integral with formidable cancelations ( i ) among contributions of positive sign in the region up to the @xmath20 resonance and of negative sign in the second resonance region and ( ii ) between the electric transverse and longitudinal contributions of the same multipolarity .",
    "we proceed by reviewing the status of the let for neutral pion photoproduction in sec .  2 .",
    "the formalism for pion electroproduction is briefly described in sec .",
    "3 . in the following sec .  4",
    "we discuss the ffr sum rule for the anomalous magnetic moment and compare the results of our dispersive calculation with the predictions of chpt .",
    "we present some preliminary results on the two ffr sum rules for electroproduction in sec .  5 , and close by a short summary in sec .",
    "the `` let '' of refs .",
    "@xcite for the reaction @xmath21 was based on current algebra and pcac .",
    "according to the theorem , the leading terms of the threshold multipole were to be given by the born diagrams , evaluated with the pseudovector pion - nucleon interaction .",
    "however , this prediction had to be revised in the light of surprising experimental evidence .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy between the theorem and the data was first explained in the framework of chpt by pion - loop corrections .",
    "an expansion of the s - wave amplitude in the mass ratio @xmath22 yielded the result  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pion - nucleon coupling constant and @xmath25  mev the pion decay constant .",
    "the first and the second terms on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) are the prediction of refs .",
    "@xcite , which however has to be corrected by the third term on the rhs .",
    "although this loop correction is formally of higher order in @xmath22 , its numerical value is of the same size as the leading term .    the energy dependence of @xmath26 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig21 ] .",
    "the discrepancy between the prediction of refs .",
    "@xcite and the experimental data obtained at the mainz microtron mami and at sal ( saskatoon ) is apparent .",
    "furthermore , the real part of the amplitude shows a characteristic `` wigner cusp '' at the threshold for charged pion production , which lies about 5  mev above the @xmath27 threshold .",
    "this cusp in the real part is related to the sharp rise of the imaginary part at the second threshold .",
    "the physical picture behind the large loop correction is based on ( i ) the large production rate of the charged pions and ( ii ) the charge - exchange scattering between the nucleon and the slow @xmath28 in the intermediate state , which leaves a @xmath27 in the final state .",
    "however , the direct experimental determination of the imaginary part will require double - polarization experiments with linearly polarized photons and polarized targets .",
    "the excellent agreement between chpt and the data for @xmath29 is somewhat flawed by the fact that higher order diagrams are sizeable , that is , the perturbative series converges slowly and low - energy constants appearing at the higher orders reduce the predictive power .",
    "+     +    the great success of chpt for photoproduction at threshold was a strong motivation to extend the experimental program to electroproduction .",
    "the first of such investigations were performed at nikhef  @xcite and mami  @xcite for @xmath30gev@xmath31 , and provided another confirmation of chpt although at the expense of 2 new low - energy constants , which were fitted to the data . in order to further check this agreement ,",
    "data were also taken at lower momentum transfer . whereas the former experiments were only sensitive to the real part of the amplitudes , weis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite also determined the fifth structure function ( @xmath32 ) , which contains information on the phase of the s - wave amplitude .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] .",
    "we observe that only the dynamical dubna - mainz - taipei ( dmt ) model @xcite is able to fully describe the experiment , in particular its prediction for the helicity asymmetry is right on top of the data .",
    "such dynamical models start from a description of the pion - nucleon scattering phases by a quasi - potential , which serves as input for an integral equation to account for multiple scattering . in this sense",
    "the model contains the loop corrections to an arbitrary number of rescattering processes , and is therefore perfectly unitary , albeit on a phenomenological basis that may violate gauge invariance to some extent .",
    "let us consider the reaction @xmath33 , where the variables in brackets denote the four - momenta of the participating particles .",
    "the familiar mandelstam variables are @xmath34 , and @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the crossing - symmetric variable .",
    "the latter variable is related to the photon lab energy @xmath37 by @xmath38 .",

( iii ) different order approximations of hbchpt lead to quite different results in the sub - threshold region .",
    "the shortcomings of hbchpt have of course been noted often before , and several groups are now applying newly developed manifestly lorentz - invariant renormalization schemes  @xcite to various physical processes , in particular also to pion photoproduction .",

    "in particular the leading coefficients depend on the pion mass as follows : @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath95 in the chiral limit is , of course , a necessary condition for the validity of the ffr sum rule .",
    "furthermore , the divergence of the higher expansion coefficients in that limit is the reason why the old let for neutral pion photoproduction failed .",
    "the analytic continuation of the multipole expansion for @xmath89 to the soft - pion threshold at the unphysical point ( @xmath96 ) requires some care , because the legendre polynomials @xmath97 involved in the expansion have to be evaluated at @xmath98 . as a result of this extrapolation",
    "we find that @xmath99 is zero within the error bars of our calculation , which are essentially due to the unknown higher part of the spectrum .",

    "can be expanded in a real power series in @xmath104 about @xmath73 , up to the singularity at threshold .",
    "the born and counter terms are power series in @xmath104 anyway .",

    "+    figure  [ fig45 ] displays the 4 invariant amplitudes for neutral pion photoproduction on the proton .",
    "the agreement between the maid and said results demonstrates that the imaginary parts of the amplitudes , which serve as input for the dispersion integrals , are quite similar in these two partial - wave analyses .",
    "we further observe that the cusp effect is only dominant for the amplitude @xmath89 , which signifies that the other 3 amplitudes have only small contributions from s waves and loop effects .",
    "however , the dispersion integrals can not fully describe the experimental values for @xmath111 to @xmath112 .",
    "the reason is that these integrals do not provide the pole structures of the vector mesons at @xmath113 , even though the vector meson background plays an important role in the unitarization process of maid .",
    "it is even more surprising that the dispersion integrals for the threshold amplitudes change only by a few percent if we drop the vector mesons in the construction of the absorptive amplitude by maid , whereas the vector mesons yield 20  % and 50  % of the threshold amplitudes for @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "we therefore have to accept the mandelstam hypothesis  @xcite that the amplitudes are the sum of all pole terms plus two - dimensional integrals over the double spectral region .",
    "the one - dimensional drs , e.g. at @xmath114const , follow from this representation , as has been proved for pion photoproduction by ball  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we could subtract the drs at @xmath73 , which introduces an unknown function @xmath115 .",
    "this function is real in the region of small @xmath0 , and in principle can be constructed from its imaginary part by an integral along the @xmath0-axis of fig .",

    "the apparent discrepancy between theory and experiment for @xmath118 is an open question .",
    "the inclusion of the vector meson poles does not help , because only axial vector mesons can contribute to the crossing - odd amplitude @xmath119  @xcite .",
    "+ let us next expand all 4 amplitudes for neutral pion photoproduction about the point ( @xmath120 ) .",

    "the numbers in brackets are the lecs of relativistic chpt .",
    "the differences between the full dispersive result and the lecs indicate the size of the loop terms and , in the case of @xmath89 , also of the ffr current .",
    "it is obvious that the loop contributions are small for the amplitudes @xmath111 , @xmath118 , and @xmath112 .",
    "the threshold for pion electroproduction moves with the value of @xmath135 , and in the following we evaluate the dispersive amplitude @xmath136 along the path from @xmath137 to infinity . in the soft - pion limit , the threshold moves to @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( or @xmath138 ) . as in the previous section for real photons , we can extrapolate from the physical to the soft - pion threshold for small values of @xmath2 , @xmath124 , and @xmath135 .",
    "of course , we can not expect to reproduce the ffr sum rule in this way , because the expansion coefficients of the ffr discrepancy depend on the pion mass and the dispersion calculation only provides these coefficients for the physical mass .",
    "in particular the pion - loop effects at threshold depend on the pion mass and , moreover , they produce a @xmath135 dependence very different from the nucleon form factors .",
    "however , as has been shown before , we expect a suppression of these loop effects if the dispersion integral is evaluated in the sub - threshold region .    in fig .",

    "evidently the bulk contribution to the integral stems from the @xmath77 resonance . in the real photon limit and for energies near threshold ( solid line )",
    "also the s - wave threshold production is quite sizeable , but this contribution of the pion cloud decreases rapidly if the energy moves into the sub - threshold region .",
    "it is also seen that the loop effects drop faster with momentum transfer than the resonance contributions . as discussed in the previous section , the ffr prediction",

    "the invariant amplitude becomes negative in the sub - threshold region .",
    "we conclude that the dispersive threshold amplitude is right on top of the sum rule value",
    ". however , maid is based on an isospin - symmetric form of the production amplitude , and therefore the s - wave amplitudes near threshold are only approximately correct . in view of the discussed cancelations ,",

    "our findings may be summarized as follows :    * the extension to sub - threshold kinematics provides a unique framework to determine the low - energy constants of chiral perturbation theory by global properties of the excitation spectrum . * the fubini - furlan - rossetti sum rule allows us to determine the anomalous magnetic moments of the nucleons , @xmath175 and @xmath176 , from the pion photoproduction amplitude @xmath177 .",

    "the resulting pion - loop corrections have transition radii far above the nucleon radius . for the same reason the curvature of the invariant amplitudes is very much larger than predicted by the sum rule . as a consequence , the terms @xmath180 are of `` unnaturally '' large size such that the convergence radius of a one - loop expansion is expected to be very small . * the comparison between the said and maid results in fig .",

    "the agreement found between the experimental threshold amplitudes and the dispersive results is generally satisfactory .",
