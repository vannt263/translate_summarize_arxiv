    "several hundred models of neutrino masses and mixings can be found in the literature which purport to explain the known oscillation data and predict the currently unknown quantities .",
    "we present an overview of the types of models proposed and discuss ways in which the list of viable models can be reduced when more precise data is obtained .",
    "this presentation is an update of one published in 2006 in collaboration with mu - chun chen @xcite and , due to space restrictions , is an abreviated version of one appearing in @xcite with complete model references there .",
    "the present data within @xmath0 accuracy as determined by fogli et al .",
    "@xcite , for example , is given by @xmath1    where the last figure in parenthesis indicates a departure of the reactor neutrino angle from zero with one @xmath2 accuracy determination .",
    "the data suggests the approximate tri - bimaximal mixing texture of harrison , perkins , and scott @xcite , @xmath3    with @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the reason for the plethera of models still in agreement with experiment of course can be traced to the inaccuracy of the present data and the imprecision of the model predictions in many cases . in addition",
    ", there are a number of unknowns that must still be determined : the hierarchy and absolute mass scales of the light neutrinos ; the dirac or majorana nature of the neutrinos ; the cp - violating phases of the mixing matrix ; how close to zero the reactor neutrino angle , @xmath6 , lies ; how near maximal the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle is ; whether the approximate tri - bimaximal mixing is a softly - broken or an accidental symmmetry ; whether neutrino - less double beta decay will be observable , and how large charged lepton flavor violation will turn out to be . in this presentation",
    "we survey the models to determine what they predict for the mixing angles , and neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "the observation of neutrino oscillations implies that neutrinos have mass , with the mass squared differences given in eq.([eq : data ] ) .",
    "information concerning the absolute neutrino mass scale has been determined by the combined wmap , sdss , and lyman alpha data which place an upper limit on the sum of the masses @xcite , @xmath7    depending upon the conservative nature of the bound extracted .",
    "an extension of the sm is then required , and possible approaches include one or more of the following :    * the introduction of dim-5 effective non - renormalizable operators ; * the addition of right - handed neutrinos with their yukawa couplings to the left - handed neutrinos ; * the addition of direct mass terms with right - handed majorana couplings ; * the addition of a higgs triplet with left - handed majorana couplings ; * the addition of a fermion triplet with higgs doublet couplings .",
    "if we exclude the last possibility , the general @xmath8 neutrino mass matrix in the @xmath9 flavor basis of the six left - handed fields then has the following structure in terms of @xmath10 submatrices : @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the dirac neutrino mass matrix , @xmath13 the left - handed and @xmath14 the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrices . with @xmath15 and @xmath16 the type  i seesaw formula ,",
    "@xmath17    is obtained for the light left - handed majorana neutrinos , while if @xmath18 and @xmath16 , one obtains the mixed type i + ii seesaw formula , @xmath19    there are two main approaches which we now describe that one can pursue to learn more about the theory behind the lepton mass generation .",
    "in the top - down approach one postulates the form of the mass matrix from first principles . the models will differ then due to the horizontal flavor symmetry chosen , the vertical family symmetry ( if any ) selected , and the fermion and higgs representation assignments made .    the effective light left - handed majorana mass matrix @xmath20 is constructed directly or with the seesaw formula once the dirac neutrino matrix @xmath12 and the majorana neutrino matrices @xmath14 ( and @xmath13 ) are specified .",
    "since @xmath20 is complex symmetric , it can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation , @xmath21 , to give @xmath22    with real , positive masses down the diagonal . on the other hand ,",
    "the dirac charged lepton mass matrix is diagonalized by a bi - unitary transformation according to @xmath23    the neutrino mixing matrix @xcite , @xmath24 , is then given by + @xmath25    in the lepton flavor basis with @xmath26 .",
    "note that the majorana phase matrix @xmath27 is required in order to compensate for any phase rotation on @xmath21 needed to bring it into the particle data book phase convention @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , with a bottom - up approach in the diagonal lepton flavor basis and with the general pmns mixing matrix , one can determine the general texture of the light neutrino mass matrix to be @xmath28 & \\equiv & \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc } a & b & b'\\\\ \\cdot & f ' & e\\\\ \\cdot & \\cdot & f\\\\ \\end{array}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the matrix elements are expressed in terms of the unknown neutrino masses , mixing angles and phases . by restricting the mixing matrix",
    ", one can learn that some of the matrix elements may not be independent .",
    "after suggestions of atmospheric neutrino oscillations were found by the imb and kamiokande - ii collaborations @xcite in the early 1990 s , it became fashionable to assign texture zeros in different positions to @xmath20 with a top - down approach in hopes of identifying some flavor symmetry , but the procedure is basis dependent @xcite .",
    "another popular method invoked a @xmath29 lepton flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "the mass matrix then assumes the following form @xmath30    which only leads to an inverted hierarchy .    by making use of a bottom - up approach instead , one is able to observe that a @xmath31 interchange symmetry with @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bot - up ] ) leads to @xmath33 with @xmath34 arbitrary .",
    "on the other hand , with the assumption of exact tri - bimaximal mixing for which @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , one finds in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bot - up ] ) that @xmath37 and @xmath38 , so that just three unknowns are present .    with the realization in the past five years that neutrino mixing",
    "is well approximated by the tri - bimaximal mixing matrix , the name of the game has become one of finding what discrete horizontal flavor symmetry groups would lead naturally to this mixing pattern .",
    "such flavor symmetries can then be used as starting points with soft breaking as the next approximation .      of special interest are those groups containing doublet and triplet irreducible representations .",
    "we list several of the well - studied groups and pertinent features of each .",
    "the permutation group of three objects , @xmath39 , contains 6 elements with @xmath40 and 2 dimensional irreducible representations ( ir s ) .",
    "the same eigenstates occur as those for tri - bimaximal mixing , but there is a 2-fold neutrino mass degeneracy .",
    "the group @xmath41 of even permutations of four objects has 12 elements with ir s labeled @xmath42 , and 3 .",
    "a @xmath43 symmetry @xcite may also be included to fix the mass scale which is otherwise undetermined .",
    "early attempts to extend this flavor group to the quark sector failed , as the ckm mixing matrix for the quarks remained diagonal .",
    "the group @xmath44 is the covering group of @xmath41 , but interestingly @xmath41 is not one of its subgroups .",
    "it contains 24 elements with @xmath45 ir s , where the first four are identical to those in @xmath41 .",
    "while tri - bimaximal mixing is obtained for the leptons , due to the presence of the three doublet ir s , a satisfactory ckm mixing matrix can also be obtained for the quarks .",
    "the permutation group of 4 objects , @xmath46 , has 24 elements with @xmath47 ir s .",
    "although this and higher dimensional discrete flavor groups can also yield tri - bimaximal mixing , it appears that models based on @xmath41 are the most economical ones for the lepton sector .",
    "studies of neutrino mixing models in the framework of grand unified theories with a vertical family symmetry were first pursued in the 1990 s and more intensely following the discovery of atmospheric neutrino oscillations by the super - kamiokande collaboration in 1998 .",
    "examples exist of models based on @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , where the @xmath49 models are generally of two types .",
    "the so - called `` minimal '' @xmath49 models @xcite involve higgs fields appearing in the @xmath51 and @xmath52 ir s , but newer models of this type have been extended to include the @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and/or @xmath55 ir s .",
    "they generally result in symmetric and/or antisymmetric contributions to the quark and lepton mass matrices .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath49 models @xcite with higgs fields in the @xmath56 and @xmath54 ir s result in `` lopsided '' down quark and charged lepton mass matrices due to the @xmath48 structure of the electroweak vev s appearing in the @xmath57 and @xmath58 representations .    for either type of gut model , type i seesaws only lead to a stable normal hierarchy for the light neutrino masses @xcite , while type i + ii seesaws can also result in an inverted hierarchy .",
    "most of the @xmath49 models have a continuous and/or discrete flavor symmetry group producted with them , but no efforts were initially made to introduce a discrete flavor symmetry group from one of the types discussed earlier to achieve tri - bimaximal mixing .",
    "a few examples can now be found in the literature which combine an @xmath59 or @xmath50 gut symmetry with a @xmath44 or @xmath41 flavor symmetry with some success @xcite .",
    "the author has updated a previous survey @xcite made in collaboration with mu - chun chen in 2006 of models in the literature which satisfied the then current experimental bounds on the mixing angles and gave reasonably restrictive predictions for the reactor neutrino angle .",
    "the cutoff date for the present update is january 2009 .",
    "many models in the literature lack firm predictions for any of the mixing angles . for our analysis",
    "no requirement is made that the solar and atmospheric mixing angles or the mass differences be predicted , but if so , they must also satisfy the bounds given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : data ] ) .",
    "a complete listing of the 86 models which meet our criteria are referenced along with their predictions in @xcite .    here",
    "we simply present the model predictions in the form of histograms plotted against @xmath60 , where all models are assigned the same area , even if they extend across several basic intervals .",
    "the results are shown in figs . 1 and 2 for the lepton flavor models and grand unified models , respectively .",
    "two thirds of both types of models predict @xmath61 , while the lepton flavor models have a much longer tail extending to very small reactor neutrino angles .",
    "the planned experiments involving double chooz and daya bay reactors @xcite will reach down to @xmath62 , so roughly two - thirds of the models will be eliminated if no @xmath63 depletion is observed .",
    "both the t2k collaboration at jparc and the no@xmath64a collaboration at fermilab are also expected to probe a similar reach with their @xmath65 neutrino beams @xcite .",
    "even if @xmath63 depletion is observed with some accuracy , it is apparent from the two histograms that the order of 10 - 20 models may survive which must still be differentiated .",
    "one suggestion is to make scatterplots of @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we have attempted to do this in figs . 3 , 4 , and 5 for both the lepton flavor models and grand unified models , where only the central value predictions are plotted .",
    "most of the models considered favor central values of @xmath34 lying below 0.333 , the value for exact tri - bimaximal mixing .",
    "this is in agreement with the present value extracted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : data ] ) , but central values for @xmath68 are preferred , while the best extracted value is 0.466 from eq .",

    "in fact , the effective mass plot for perturbed tri - bimaximal mixing in fig .",
    "6 shows a clear separation of the normal and inverted ordering distributions , so accurate neutrino - less double beta decay experiments should be decisive in determining the hierarchy .",
    "we have made a survey of neutrino mixing models based on some horizontal lepton flavor symmetry and those based on gut models having a vertical family symmetry and a flavor symmetry .",
    "we have tried to differentiate the models on the basis of their neutrino mass hierarchy and mixing angles .",
    "most of the models allow either mass hierarchy with the exceptions being just normal for the type i seesaw models and only inverted for the conserved @xmath29 models .    for both types of models",
    "our study indicates that the upcoming double chooz and daya bay reactor experiments will be able to eliminate roughly two - thirds of the models surveyed , if their planned sensitivity reaches @xmath70 and no depletion of the @xmath63 flux is observed .",
    "however , no smoking gun apparently exists to rule out many types of models based on accurate data for @xmath60 alone , should evidence for a depletion be found . of the order of 10 - 20 models",
    "have similar values for this mixing angle in the 0.001 - 0.05 interval .",
    "only the lepton flavor models appear to lead to extremely small values of @xmath71 .",
    "most models prefer @xmath72 rather than 0.333 for tri - bimaximal mixing in agreement with the present best value of 0.312 . on the other hand ,",
    "most models prefer @xmath73 compared with a best fit value of 0.466 .",
    "one notable exception is the model of stech and tavartkiladze @xcite based on the @xmath50 family group with @xmath74 flavor symmetry .",
