    "the bulk of bright x - ray sources in most galaxies are compact objects formed at the endpoint of the stellar evolution of massive stars ( typically @xmath5 ) . because compact objects can be visible as x - ray binaries for lifetimes far exceeding those of their progenitor massive stars , the x - ray binary populations may be used as ` fossils ' to study the star formation history of their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite demonstrated a correlation between the 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity and star formation rates ( sfr ) for 23 , mainly nearby , galaxies .",
    "@xcite , hereafter ggs03 , extended these results to consider the x - ray point source luminosity function ( xlf ) in addition to the total x - ray luminosity .",
    "they found a correlation between the number of x - ray sources in a galaxy and the star formation rate .",
    "this correlation does not suffer the strong malmquist bias of the luminosity correlation .",
    "however , due to the limitations of their sample , ggs03 measured the correlation between the number of x - ray sources in a galaxy and the star formation rate only for galaxies with star formation rates of @xmath6 or less .",
    "it is of interest to extend these measurements to galaxies with larger star formation rates .",
    "we have obtained _ chandra _ observations of two galaxies , ngc 4194 and ngc 7541 , selected from the sample of @xcite . both have high star formation rates , near @xmath7 , but are close enough , nearer than 40  mpc , to distinguish individual x - ray sources .",
    "see table  [ galaxies ] for some basic properties of the galaxies .",
    "ngc 4914 , also known as the medusa , is a minor merger at a distance of 39.5  mpc @xcite .",
    "ngc 7541 is an sbc galaxy and has a companion galaxy ngc 7537 .",
    "it was the host of sn1998dh which allows an accurate distance estimate of @xmath8  mpc @xcite .",
    "we also extracted results from the literature and from the data archives for additional galaxies with star formation rates above @xmath9/yr .",
    "our observations and analysis are described in section  2 . in  3 , we discuss the x - ray point source luminosity functions . in  4 , we discuss the relation of x - ray source populations to star formation rate .",
    ".contains for each galaxy : the galaxy name , ra , dec , distance , star formation rate ( sfr ) , the major and minor diameters and position angle of the @xmath10 ellipse from the rc3 catalog , the number of x - ray sources above a luminosity of @xmath11 , and the total x - ray luminosity @xmath12 in the 2 - 10 kev band .",
    "the distances are from @xcite for ngc 4914 and from @xcite for ngc 7541 . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the galaxies m51 , m74 , m82 , ngc 4579 , ngc 1068 , and the antennae , we extracted source counts from the literature . in each case , we estimated the number of background agn included in the count using the source counts from @xcite unless this was already done in the reference or background and foreground sources were already excluded by a search for counterparts at other wavelengths . below we will integrate the xlf to find the total x - ray luminosity due to point sources .",
    "for this to be valid , the energy band used to find the point source luminosities must match the energy band used to calculate the total x - ray luminosity , specifically 210  kev .",
    "thus , we corrected the source luminosities from the literature to this energy band .",
    "we used the spectral model assumed in each paper .",
    "however , using a power - law model as for ngc 4194 and ngc 7541 produced no significant change .",
    "we note that ggs03 extracted x - ray point source luminosities from the literature and made no attempt to correct for the differing energy bands and assumptions concerning spectra shape made in the various papers .",
    "we find that , for the galaxies in their sample , making the energy band correction produces a large change only for the antennae .",
    "in addition to the energy band correction , @xcite recently found a distance to the antennae based on the red giant branch tip of @xmath13  mpc that is significantly lower than previous distances including that used by ggs03 .",
    "also , one of the antennae sources was identified as a background agn @xcite .",
    "thus , the star formation rate for the antennae becomes @xmath14 and the number of sources above @xmath11 becomes 9 .",
    "for m51 , we find 11 net sources above @xmath15 in the 2 - 10  kev band using the 28 kev band results of @xcite . for m74",
    ", we estimate two sources from the 28 kev band results of @xcite . for m82",

    ", we estimate 3 sources from the results of @xcite . for ngc 1068",
    ", we estimate 18 net sources from the 0.58 kev band results of @xcite . for these galaxies , we have adopted the sfrs quoted by ggs03 rescaled to the distances listed in table  [ nsfr_table ] except for ngc 1068 and ngc 4945 where we have calculated the sfr from the fir luminosities quoted in @xcite rescaled to the distances quoted in table  [ nsfr_table ] . both are seyfert 2 galaxies containing an active galactic nucleus which produces infrared emission .",
    "thus , the sfr calculated from the total fir luminosity may overestimate the true sfr .",
    "however , the starburst in ngc 1068 is known to dominate the flux at wavelengths longer than 30  @xmath16 m @xcite , so agn contamination does not strongly affect the sfr estimate .",

    "the xlf for ngc 4194 appears flatter than the ggs03 xlf .",
    "the observation duration is sufficient to detect sources with luminosities down to at least @xmath11 with high efficiency ; a luminosity of @xmath11 should produce 7 counts and a @xmath19 detection .",
    "however , the diffuse x - ray emission near the nucleus , where most of the star formation is concentrated , hampers our ability to detect sources .",
    "indeed , there is a possible source located at @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( j2000 ) that lies in the region of diffuse emission .",

    "we note that our slope is lower than that quoted by ggs03 .",
    "we expect that the number of sources found for each galaxy by ggs03 is higher than the true number for the following reasons .",
    "ggs03 did not correct the source luminosities quoted in the literature in various energy bands usually extending down to 0.5 or 0.1  kev to the 2 - 10  kev band used for the sfr versus x - ray luminosity relation .",
    "the ggs03 sample contained mainly nearby and large angular diameter galaxies , and , thus , would likely include a significant number of background agn .",
    "these were not subtracted out .",
    "the ggs03 sample may be biased to galaxies with unusually large x - ray point source populations , since the early _ chandra _ observations of galaxies tended to be of those with high x - ray fluxes .",
    "also , their sample contained many face - on galaxies .",
    "the source detection included counts in the soft x - ray band ( usually down to 0.3  kev ) , and was , thus , most efficient for face - on galaxies where absorption within the host is low .",
    "this could be corrected by using only counts in the 210  kev for source detection .",
    "however , the relatively low effective area of chandra above 2  kev would increase the detection threshold above @xmath11 in many cases .",
    "it is also possible that the difference reflects some dependence of x - ray source formation on the properties of the host galaxy .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity has been suggested as a sfr indicator by @xcite .",
    "we estimated the x - ray flux in the 210  kev band for each galaxy by summing the counts in the 28 kev band for all the point sources and then converting this sum to a total count rate and then to an unabsorbed energy flux assuming a power - law spectrum with a photon index @xmath44 and given the absorption column density along the line of sight to the galaxy .",
    "for ngc 4194 , we included all the counts in the larger nuclear region , but excluded the likely background agn .",
    "we find a luminosity in the 210 kev band of @xmath45 for ngc 4194 and @xmath46 for ngc 7541 .",
    "we note that both galaxies have sufficiently high sfr that they are in the linear regime of the @xmath47-sfr relation .",
    "the ratio of 2 - 10 kev luminosity , @xmath48 , in units of @xmath49 , to sfr , in units of @xmath50 , is @xmath51 for ngc 4194 and 0.15 for ngc7541 . from the relation quoted above between sfr and the number of x - ray sources , and assuming the x - ray luminosity function of ggs03",
    ", we calculate a value of @xmath52 .",
    "this value is somewhat lower than , but not inconsistent with , the ratio of 0.5 found by @xcite . comparing directly with the fir luminosity , we find @xmath53 .",
    "it is possible to estimate the fraction of mass involved in star formation which is accreted onto compact objects .",
    "we define @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the efficiency for conversion of matter into radiation . if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 , where @xmath48 is the luminosity in units of @xmath49 and @xmath59 is the star formation rate in @xmath60 . using the x - ray luminosity of sfr ratio found above",
    ", we find @xmath61 .",
    "allowing a bolometric correction for the x - ray luminosity would increase this value by a factor of @xmath62 .",
    "this value should constrain population synthesis models of the formation and evolution of x - ray binaries .",
    "we note that this value includes only the ` prompt ' accretion , i.e.  that occurring while the star formation is still active .",
