    "granular materials exhibit phases analogous to conventional solids , liquids , and gases , in spite of being athermal and dissipative @xcite . due to the dissipation",
    ", energy must be supplied in order to sustain a dynamical state .",
    "shearing and vibration are two common means to inject energy into granular systems . shearing a granular material",
    "can compact and crystallize it @xcite , but also melt it @xcite ; tapping will compact it @xcite ; in thin vibrated layers there can be coexistence of crystallized and disordered states @xcite ; and highly vibrated granular systems become gas - like . from a large phase space of variables",
    "we vary only two , the shear rate and vibration amplitude , and study the interaction of the two energy injection mechanisms .    without vibration , sheared granular materials undergo a phase transition from solid - like to fluid - like behavior : the particles must become unjammed ( which typically involves dilation ) before they can move .",
    "we seek to understand what effects vibrations have on such transitions , and on the characteristics of the states on either side of the transition .",
    "this is particularly interesting given that granular systems are athermal , and one might naively expect that vibrations would play a temperature - like role .    we perform experiments in a classic geometry , annular shear flow @xcite , with monodisperse particles , shown schematically in figure  [ f_exp ] . shear and vibration provide competing effects , with the system evolving to a crystallized state when the kinetic energy provided by the vibration is greater than that provided by the shear .",
    "the transition is hysteretic , and fluctuations in the packing fraction and the breadth of the force distribution both become large as the crystallized state is approached , in similarity to phase transitions in other systems .",
    "the physical parameters that characterize the system include the amplitude @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1 of vibration , the height @xmath2 and mean radius @xmath3 of the annular container , the diameter @xmath4 and the density @xmath5 of the particles , the rotation rate @xmath6 of the upper shearing surface , and the mean pressure @xmath7 on the layer ( here characterized at the base of the layer ) . from these physical parameters ,",
    "it is possible to define other dimensioned parameters , such as the shear rate , @xmath8 , as well as a number of dimemsionless parameters which we list in table  [ t_dimnums ] .",
    ".dimensionless ratios , with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 [ t_dimnums ] [ cols=\"^,^ , < \" , ]     @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are three key parameters from the list in table  [ t_dimnums ] .",
    "of the ten listed , there are only seven independent parameters : for example , @xmath15 and the four velocity ratios @xmath16 only represent three parameters . in the experiments described here , we have fixed",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath7 , and @xmath17 and therefore only explored a small region of the available phase space .",
    "the experimental apparatus consists of an annular region containing nearly monodisperse polypropylene spheres of diameter @xmath18 to 2.39 mm and density @xmath19 g/@xmath20 , as shown in figure  [ f_exp ] , with the pressure @xmath7 and volume @xmath21 ( height @xmath22 ) set from below by a spring within an electromagnetic shaker .",
    "the particles are sheared from above and vibrated from below , while the sidewalls are stationary .",
    "a more detailed description of the apparatus is given in @xcite .",
    "to characterize the states , we obtain high - speed video images of particles at the outer plexiglas wall , laser position measurements of the bottom plate ( cell volume ) , and force time series from a capacitive sensor flush with the bottom plate . for the experiments described in this paper",
    ", we fix the frequency of vibration ( @xmath23 hz ) and number of particles ( @xmath24 ) , and vary the amplitude of vibration @xmath0 and shear rate @xmath6 .",
    "we vary the nondimensionalized peak acceleration @xmath25 from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , and nondimensional shear rate @xmath28 from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "in the regime @xmath31 and @xmath32 we observe two distinct granular states of matter : crystallized and disordered .",
    "sample images and movies of these two states are shown in figure  [ f_phases]ab , as viewed from the outer wall . for @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we observe that the phase boundary between the two states roughly corresponds to a curve where the characteristic velocities of the two motions are equal .",
    "this corresponds to the dimensionless number @xmath14 of table  [ t_dimnums ] : @xmath35 and the curve @xmath36 is shown by the dashed line in figure  [ f_phases]c .",
    "below , we characterize these two states , with further details to be found in @xcite .    _",
    "crystallized state : _ in the solid - like state ( see figure  [ f_phases]a ) , the balls crystallize into a hexagonally close - packed configuration ( _ i.e. _ a 3d crystalline structure ) here visible only at the outer wall although the order persists across the layer . the contact between the upper layer of the granular material and the shearing wheel is intermittent , with stick - slip motion of the top @xmath37 layers in the manner of @xcite .",
    "the distribution of forces measured at the bottom of the layer is bimodal ( see figure  [ f_fpdfs ] ) ; this indicates that the material is responding as a solid body moving up and down with the sinusoidal vibrations of the bottom plate .",
    "_ disordered state : _ in the disordered state , some order remains in the form of hexagonally - packed clusters and linear chains of particles at the outer wall , as marked in figure  [ f_phases]b . for states with @xmath6 well above the transition , linear chains dominate over hexagonal clusters , with both existing intermittently throughout the disordered regime .",
    "these chains may correspond to the planar ordering reported recently by tsai et al . @xcite .",
    "the velocity profile extends deeper into the layer ( in the vertical direction ) than in the crystallized state .",
    "force distributions measured at the bottom plate show the exponential - like tails characteristic of many granular experiments in disordered , unvibrated granular materials ( see figure  [ f_fpdfs ] ) .",
    "they also fall to zero at low force , as seen in earlier experiments by miller et al .",
    "@xcite .    for a geometrically similar system , but unvibrated and exposed to a compressional force , shear _ ordered _ the system into horizontal planes of hexagonal packing , each slipping past the others @xcite .",
    "such a state is different from the 3d crystallized state observed here , in which the layers in the bulk are stationary with respect to each other .",
    "an interesting question is how shearing creates order or disorder depending on the presence or absence of vibration .",
    "a useful way to distinguish the ordered and disordered regimes is via the ratio @xmath38 involving the shear time scale @xmath39 to the acoustic time scale , @xmath40 , calculated from the pressure @xmath7 and density @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the experiments described in this paper have pressures of around @xmath41 pa and shear rates of @xmath42 to 40 hz , leading to @xmath43 to 0.75 . in @xcite ,",
    "the shear rates are slower , @xmath44 to 0.5 hz , and pressures are higher , @xmath45 pa , so that the system is clearly in the quasistatic regime with @xmath46 to @xmath47 .    while it is perhaps surprising that we find as simple a result as a phase transition at @xmath48 , the presence of these other important control parameters give hints into the breakdown of crystallization for large @xmath12 .",
    "figure  [ f_phases]c shows that for @xmath49 , crystallization was not observed above @xmath50 , possibly indicating the re - emergence of disorder due to granular - gas like behavior . further experiments varying @xmath51 will be necessary to discover which of these determine the high-@xmath12 boundary of the crystallized phase . in addition , the parameter @xmath2 controls finite size effects .",
    "granular materials commonly exhibit shear banding , with an exponentially decaying velocity profile away from the shearing surface .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f_rotvelprofile]a , this shear band behavior is seen in both the crystallized @xmath52 and disordered states @xmath53 for @xmath54 . to obtain the velocity profiles",
    ", we tracked individual particles visible at the outer wall using a high - speed video camera and determimed trajectories for each .",
    "we then binned the resulting velocity components by depth to construct velocity profiles .",
    "we characterize the azimuthal velocity , @xmath55 , by fitting the profile to the form @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the solid - body motion at the bottom plate , @xmath58 is the known azimuthal velocity of the shear wheel at the outer wall , @xmath59 is the efficiency with which that velocity is transmitted to the top layer of granular material , and @xmath60 is the decay length of the velocity with depth .    in the crystallized state , the shear is localized almost entirely to the first layer of particles ( small @xmath60 ) , while in the disordered state the shear band extends several particles into the layer .",
    "the slip at the upper plate is lowest in the disordered state , where the uppermost particles are in constant contact with the shearing wheel .",
    "note that the system is more dilated in the disordered state , and has a larger pressure @xcite .",
    "while the disordered state has greater slip ( @xmath57 ) at the bottom plate , the scaled slip values ( @xmath61 ) are in fact lower than in the crystallized state , visible in figure  [ f_rotvelprofile]a . for disordered states with @xmath62 , the shear bands appear to have reached a steady state since they are all parameterized by the same values .",
    "we examined the transition from the disordered to the crystallized state by first preparing a disordered state at high @xmath63 , then adjusting @xmath64 to the value of interest .",
    "we then performed two runs , one at constant @xmath65 ( starting from @xmath66 ) and the other at constant @xmath67 ( starting from @xmath68 ) . the mean volume measured for each step of these two runs",
    "is shown in figure  [ f_hysteresis ] .    for steps of decreasing @xmath6 ( figure  [ f_hysteresis]a ) the system compacts logarithmically until reaching @xmath69 , after which the system undergoes a first order phase transition to the crystallized state .",
    "below @xmath69 only a small amount of additional compaction occurs , to a state with a volume @xmath70 , for which the packing fraction is @xmath71 .",
    "when @xmath6 is increased , the transition back to the disordered state is hysteretic , occurring for @xmath72 .    for steps of increasing @xmath12 ( figure  [ f_hysteresis]b ) the system also compacts . however , runs approaching the transition are difficult to repeat quantitatively , since there is a great deal of intermittency in the cell volume ( see figures  [ f_hysteresis]b , [ f_velprofile]a and @xcite for details ) . for @xmath73",
    "the system is in the crystallized state .",
    "the transition also appears to be first order , but in this case the hysteresis is so extreme that the material was not observed to re - expand when we decreased @xmath12 .",
    "we wish to understand why a crystallized state can disorder by increasing @xmath6 , but not by decreasing @xmath12 . in the case of increasing @xmath6 , the stick - slip behavior in the top layers of the crystallized state",
    "is affected by the speed of the upper shearing wheel .",
    "as @xmath6 increases , more horizontal momentum is transfered to the upper layer of balls , which results in longer regions of flowing particles .",
    "eventually , the whole layer can be seen to mobilize and the disordering begins to take place throughout the cell .",
    "in contrast , for increases in @xmath0 ( and hence @xmath12 ) no such increased momentum transfer takes place , and the results are similar to the irreversibility observed for compaction by tapping @xcite .",
    "this transition shows some similarity similarity to the `` freezing - by - heating '' transition seen in @xcite , in which individual particles with tunable noise are seen to crystallize as their noise level is increased .",
    "such a system also shows hysteresis in returning to the disordered , mobilized state .    for the run at @xmath74 , seen in figure  [ f_hysteresis]a with steps downward in @xmath6 , we observe signatures of the phase transition from disorder to crystallization via both the volume fluctuations and the force distribution , as shown in figures  [ f_rotforce ] and [ f_rotfluct ] . as @xmath75 from above , both",
    "the volume fluctuations ( measured from the variance of @xmath76 ) and the breadth of the force distribution ( measured by the kurtosis , or fourth scaled moment , of @xmath77 on the force sensor ) become large .",
    "in addition , the first order nature of the transition is visible in other characteristics of the force distribution , such as the mean , standard deviation , and skewness ( see also figure  [ f_fpdfs ] ) .    in granular systems , edwards and coworkers @xcite",
    "have introduced a temperature - like measure , the compactivity , defined as @xmath78 by analogy with thermodynamics .",
    "the central idea is that lower packing fractions correspond to a greater freedom for particle rearrangement , and hence a higher compactivity . in the statistical mechanics of ordinary second order phase transitions , susceptibilities such as @xmath79 ( for free energy @xmath0 )",
    "are singular at the critical point .",
    "for example , the specific heat at constant volume is @xmath80 . when described in terms of fluctuation - dissipation relations , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the energy of the system and @xmath83 its mean value .",
    "one expects energy fluctuations , and hence @xmath84 , to be singular at the critical temperature @xmath85 .",
    "by contrast , at a first order transition , discontinuities occur in densities , but one does not expect divergent fluctuations . since @xmath21 has taken the place of @xmath82 in the edwards formalism , the hallmark of a critical transition is increased fluctuations in the volume of the system as we approach @xmath86 , the critical compactivity . in our experiments , volume ( and hence @xmath87 )",
    "is set by @xmath6 , and the inset to figure  [ f_rotfluct ] shows apparently singular behavior for the volume fluctuations as a function of the volume .",
    "it is interesting that in these experiments , we see a discontinuity in the density , but also an indication of a singularity in the volume fluctuations .",
    "the magnitude of the fluctuations observed in the disordered state is similar to those in observed in @xcite , where the standard deviation of the packing fraction is approximately @xmath88 .",
    "the apparently singular volume fluctuations near @xmath36 come from the fact that the system exhibits intermittency in its state .",
    "the system is in fact spatially inhomogeneous , with instances of small @xmath21 being crystallized in the majority of the cell and instances of large @xmath21 being majority disordered . by examining the properties of the system in this intermittent regime , we are able to compare a broad range of states for nearly the same parameter values .",
    "the only varying parameters are the volume and pressure of the system , which are related to each other by a proportionality constant due to the spring constant of the shaker @xcite .",
    "the inset to figure  [ f_velprofile]a shows a time series of the cell height for such a run , with @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the system started from a dilated state and progressed to a majority crystallized state before re - dilating and re - compacting to an even more crystallized state over the course of approximately 10 hours .",
    "we again obtain velocity profiles at the outer wall , in this case while simultaneously monitoring the position of the bottom plate .",
    "figure  [ f_velprofile]a shows two velocity profiles from compact and dilated states . because the system is spatially inhomogeneous , the particles in view of the camera may in fact be either disordered or crystallized at any given time during these measurements , regardless of the height of the cell .",
    "importantly , the fit parameters in figure  [ f_velprofile]b - d show the same trends as those in figure  [ f_rotvelprofile ] when rotation rate @xmath64 is taken as a proxy for cell height . in both cases ,",
    "we observe a continuum of states as the system moves between crystallization ( compaction ) and disorder ( dilation ) .",
    "again , it is interesting to note that the volume and pressure fluctuations are associated with the formation and melting of ordered clusters over time .",
    "such behavior is characteristic of near - critical behavior .",
    "by contrast , at a thermodynamic first order transition , we would not expect to see persistent dominant fluctuations .",
    "the two characterizations of a transition in the system we discuss above provide contrasting , but complimentary , information about the nature of the crystallizing phase transition in sheared and vibrated granular materials .",
    "the canonical hallmark of a transition to a jammed / glassy state is the continuous growth of the viscosity .",
    "glass transitions do not in general contain first - order - like signatures , such as discontinuities in the volume or specific heat @xcite . for sheared colloids , there are large stress fluctuations near a jamming transition @xcite , and in simulations of lennard - jones particles , force pdfs are observed to broaden @xcite .",
    "similar behavior is observed in this system as well , but with a density discontinuity . by contrast ,",
    "jammed / glassy states are all _ disordered _ , while the granular system described in this paper makes a transition to a _ crystallized _ state . in both the glassy and crystallized cases , however , the final states are unable to rearrange .",
    "we observe similarities to critical phenomena in the increased volume fluctuations near the transition , a hallmark at odds with a glass transition .",
    "these fluctuations are similar to the density fluctuations observed at the liquid - gas critical point , which occur at diverging length scales .",
    "therefore , further investigations into the nature of this transition should examine what length scales and order parameters are present , including a determination of the sizes of clusters and the spatial correlations between forces .",
    "finally , we have introduced a number of dimensionless control parameters whose effects remain to be investigated in future studies .",
    "this research was supported by the nasa microgravity program under grant nnc04gb08 g , and north carolina state university ."
