    "the relationship between the transmitted symbol and the received signal vector in many communication systems can be expressed in the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the @xmath3 transmitted vector whose entries are chosen from a finite symbol alphabet , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the @xmath6 received signal and noise vectors , respectively , and @xmath7 is @xmath8 channel matrix . as a practical decoding scheme when a code constraint is imposed , _ iterative detection and decoding _ (",

    "motivated by the _ turbo principle _ @xcite , an idd receiver exchanges soft information between a symbol detector and a channel decoder to achieve performance close to the channel capacity .",
    "the symbol detector computes _ a posteriori _ probabilities ( app ) on the bits comprising @xmath2 , using _ a priori _ probabilities provided by the channel decoder and the observation @xmath4 .",
    "then , the detector exchanges this soft information ( so called _ extrinsic _ information ) with a soft - input soft - output decoder , such as the max - log - map decoder @xcite . in the sequel",
    ", we refer to such a detector as an _ app detector_. direct computation of the app involves marginalization over all configurations of the vector @xmath2 , leading to exponential complexity in the system size ( e.g. , number of antenna elements in mimo systems ) . as a means of approximately performing the app detection at reduced complexity ,",
    "_ tree detection techniques _ have received much attention recently @xcite .",
    "( refer to @xcite for an overview of tree detection techniques . )",
    "the essence of these approaches is to produce a set of promising symbol candidates via a tree search for estimating the app over this reduced set . thus far , a variety of tree detection algorithms have been proposed . in @xcite , the _ sphere decoding algorithm _ ( sda )",
    "@xcite with a fixed radius was used to find symbol candidates . in @xcite ,",
    "_ a priori _ information obtained from the channel decoder was exploited to improve the search efficiency of the sda . in @xcite ,",
    "a hard sphere decoder was employed to find a single _ maximum a posteriori _ probability ( map ) symbol estimate maximizing @xmath9 and a candidate list was generated by flipping bits in the map estimate . in @xcite , the apps of all bits in @xmath2 are obtained simultaneously by modifying a bound tightening rule of a single sphere search . additionally ,",
    "a more sophisticated extension of this idea was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the computational complexity of these tree detection algorithms varies depending on the channel and noise realizations , and in the worst - case the search complexity is the same as that of exhaustive search . in order to limit the worst case complexity of the tree detection approach , _ fixed - complexity tree search _",
    "techniques @xcite have been proposed .",
    "for example , an @xmath0-algorithm was extended to soft - input soft - output detection in @xcite and an intelligent candidate adding algorithm for improving efficiency of the @xmath0-algorithm was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the stack algorithm was also exploited for list generation in combination with soft augmentation of tail bits of stack elements @xcite .",
    "other fixed - complexity soft - input soft - output detection algorithms can be found in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-algorithm @xcite , also known as _",
    "@xmath10-best algorithm _ in the mimo detection literature @xcite , selects only a finite set of the @xmath0 best candidates for each layer of the detection tree .",
    "the @xmath0-algorithm is a practical candidate for soft - input soft - output detection due to its inherent nature to facilitate parallel and pipelined processing @xcite . in spite of this benefit ,",
    "the @xmath0-algorithm suffers from a poor performance - complexity trade - off due to the greedy nature of the algorithm . to be specific",
    ", the algorithm checks the validity of paths in the forward direction and never traverses back for reconsideration .",
    "once the correct path is rejected , it will never be selected again in subsequent selections , resulting in wasteful search effort .",
    "moreover , these erroneous decisions often occur in early candidate selection stages where the accumulated path metric considers only a few symbol spans . one way to alleviate such error propagation is symbol detection ordering @xcite . by processing each layer in an appropriate order ,",
    "the chances of errors propagating to the next stage can be reduced .",
    "nevertheless , error propagation severely limits the performance of the @xmath0-algorithm especially when the system size is large .    in this paper",
    ", we pursue an improvement of the performance - complexity trade - off of soft - input soft - output @xmath0-algorithms . towards this end , we propose a new path metric capturing the contribution of the entire symbol path . while the conventional path metric accounts for the contributions of symbols along the visited path only , the new path metric looks ahead to the unvisited paths and estimates their contributions through a soft unconstrained linear symbol estimate .",
    "in fact , a _ bias term _ reflecting the information from as - yet undecided symbols is incorporated into the conventional path metric for this purpose . in order to distinguish this improved path metric from the conventional path metric and other look - ahead metrics",
    ", we henceforth refer to it as a _ linear estimate - based look - ahead ( le - la ) path metric_. we apply the le - la path metric to the soft - input soft - output @xmath0-algorithm , introducing an _ improved soft - in soft - out @xmath0-algorithm _ ( iss - ma ) . by sorting paths based on the le - la path metric",
    ", the iss - ma lessens the chance of rejecting the correct path from the candidate list and eventually improves the detection performance especially for systems of large dimension .",
    "indeed , from an analysis of the probability of correct path loss ( cpl ) , we show that the le - la path metric benefits the candidate selection process of the @xmath0-algorithm .",
    "the idea of using a look - ahead path metric has been explored in artificial intelligence search problems @xcite and can also be found in soft decoding of linear block codes @xcite . in @xcite , computationally efficient methods to obtain the bias term were investigated using semi - definite programming and @xmath11 estimation techniques . while these approaches search for a _ deterministic _ bias term ( lower - bound of future cost ) to guarantee the optimality of the sequential or depth - first search , our approach uses linear estimation to derive a bias term designed to improve candidate selection of the breadth - first search .",
    "the key advantage of using a linear estimator is that _ a priori _ information can be easily incorporated into the bias term so that the look - ahead operation benefits from the decoder output in each iteration .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing the difference between the proposed path metric and fano matric @xcite .",
    "the fano metric exploits the _ a posteriori _ probability of each path as its path metric . for a binary symmetric channel ,",
    "the fano metric introduces a bias term proportional to the path length to penalize paths of short length .",
    "the extension of the fano metric to channels with memory or mimo channels is not straightforward , since it involves marginalization over the distribution of the undecided symbols .",
    "modification of the fano metric is considered for equalization of intersymbol interference ( isi ) channels in @xcite and for multi - input multi - output detection in @xcite . as a means to improve path metric of the sda ,",
    "the idea of probabilistic pruning was introduced in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the probability density of an observed signal estimated from a separate tree search is used as a bias term .",
    "while these approaches assign an equal bias term for paths of the same length , the iss - ma provides a distinct bias term for each path in the tree , allowing for the application of a breadth - first search such as the @xmath0-algorithm . as such",
    ", our path metric can be readily combined with any type of tree - based soft - input soft - output detector .",

    "<S> tree detection techniques are often used to reduce the complexity of _ a posteriori probability _ ( app ) detection in high dimensional multi - antenna wireless communication systems . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce an efficient soft - input soft - output tree detection algorithm that employs a new type of look - ahead path metric in the computation of its branch pruning ( or sorting ) . </S>",
    "<S> while conventional path metrics depend only on symbols on a visited path , the new path metric accounts for unvisited parts of the tree in advance through an unconstrained linear estimator and adds a bias term that reflects the contribution of as - yet undecided symbols . by applying the linear estimate - based look - ahead path metric to an @xmath0-algorithm that selects the best @xmath0 paths for each level of the tree </S>",
    "<S> we develop a new soft - input soft - output tree detector , called an _ improved soft - input soft - output @xmath0-algorithm _ ( iss - ma ) . </S>",
    "<S> based on an analysis of the probability of correct path loss , we show that the improved path metric offers substantial performance gain over the conventional path metric . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate through simulations that the iss - ma provides a better performance - complexity trade - off than existing soft - input soft - output detection algorithms . </S>"
