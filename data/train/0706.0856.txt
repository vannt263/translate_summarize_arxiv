    "it is widely believed that dark matter halos have a universal density profile . in the last decade",
    "the debate focused largely on whether the slope of the density profile , @xmath0 , approaches values close to @xmath8 or @xmath4 at small radii .",
    "the concentration , @xmath1 , of dark halos supposedly incorporates all the physics : the dependence on the cosmological model , the halo mass and redshift of virialization .",
    "however , the determination of the inner slope of halos is uncertain due to the scatter of halo shapes and a well known degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 when fitting the density profiles .",
    "indeed , only a few published simulations have sufficiently high resolution to partially resolve this degeneracy and these simulations only cover a limited range of halo masses ( typically milky - way type or cluster type halos ) at redshift @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    ", we re - analyze data from n - body simulations performed in @xcite , henceforth r03 , and compare them to a new set of simulations performed using gadget2 @xcite at the same and higher resolution than in r03 .",
    "the r03 results are of particular interest because , in r03 , it was first found that the log slope of the inner parts ( at 10% of the virialization radius for just virialized halos ) of the dark matter density profile , @xmath0 , varies with the mass of the halo .",
    "this result may ease some tension between theory and observations .",
    "indeed , for low mass halos ( @xmath10 ) , which should correspond to dsph galaxies ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and perhaps some low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies , r03 finds @xmath11 at 10% of the virial radius ( where @xmath12  kpc ) . in r03 ,",
    "milky - way type halos with mass @xmath13 are well fitted by a nfw profile with @xmath14 @xcite and there is also some evidence that higher mass systems ( @xmath15 ) have steeper cusps , @xmath16 .",
    "this is consistent with results in @xcite , although this latter paper also proposes @xmath17 for rather small , galaxy mass halos ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "it is important to clarify that the quoted values of @xmath0 in the inner part of the halos depend on the resolution of the simulations ( , in r03 is fixed to be about 10% of the virial radius ) .",
    "there is no reason to believe that @xmath0 converges to any asymptotic value as suggested by the arguments in r03 and and by high - resolution simulation of milky - way size halos @xcite .",
    "note that the result in r03 does not depend on this assumption .",
    "in r03 we show that nfw profile does not provide good fits for small mass halos at @xmath19 by comparing the shapes of the circular velocities of just virialized halos with widely different masses ( hence , virialized at different redshifts ) .",
    "our conclusion is that density profiles do not have an universal shape as often assumed before .",
    "a theoretical interpretation of this result is also proposed based on previous work by @xcite in which a simple relationship that relates @xmath0 to the slope of the power spectrum of initial density perturbations is provided .",
    "our results are consistent with this simple scaling relationship , suggesting that the halo shape at a given mass or spatial scale depends on the the slope of the power spectrum at that scale .",
    "this result is based on formal fitting of the circular velocities of the halos with generalized nfw profiles .",
    "@xcite performed similar simulations and failed to find shallow cores in a similar mass range .",
    "nevertheless , similar correlations have been found by others , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". more recent work by @xcite and @xcite also find a correlation between halo mass and the shape of the density profile .",
    "in this case they parameterize this correlation in terms of the srsic index , @xmath20 , rather than a central log - slope dependence . in @xcite",
    "is argued that this parameterization provide a better fit of high - resolution halos than a split power - law .",
    "the main motivation of this letter is to understand whether the r03 results are in contradiction with previous works and clarify if the discrepancy can be attributed to the method of analysis , the n - body code used by r03 , or insufficient resolution of the simulation .",
    "ricotti used a @xmath21 n - body integrator and analyzed the data using circular velocities instead of density profiles . here",
    "we adopt the widely used `` tree '' n - body integrator gadget2 , with @xmath22 and @xmath23 particles and we develop a quantitative method to analyze the density profiles using a standard @xmath24 minimization technique .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section [ sec : data ] , we describe the set of simulations from which data have been used and the procedures we have adopted and developed for analyzing individual halos ; in section [ sec : results ] we present the results ; finally we conclude in section  [ sec : concl  disc ] .",
    "all simulations used and referred to in this work have identical cosmological parameters : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "r03 uses a @xmath21 integrator @xcite while our new simulations employ the tree code gadget2 @xcite .",
    "the general notation we use to label each simulation is : run - l , where run = r03 , gr03 , g256 and g512 describe a different simulation and l = 1,32,256 refers to the box size ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) .",
    "the runs `` r03 '' refer to the original r03 simulations , `` gr03 '' use the initial conditions in r03 but are re - run using gadget2 , `` g256 '' and `` g512 '' are new runs using gadget2 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 particles , respectively .",
    "the purpose of running the new simulations gr03 , g256 and g512 was to ensure the results in r03 were not affected by any irregularity in the simulation method employed .",
    "gr03 checks for problems with the r03 simulation parameters and code ; g256 checks the initial conditions and g512 checks for resolution related issues .",
    "the redshift of analysis in all @xmath31 simulations is @xmath32 .",
    "the larger box sizes are analyzed when the clustering of the most massive halos is similar , which turns out to be @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath9 for @xmath35 .",
    "we extracted the halos using a friends - of - friends algorithm with linking length @xmath36 ( chosen by analogy with the spherical collapse model ) .",
    "we follow the iterative method of @xcite to ensure that the extracted halos are bound . at each stage the total energy of each particle is calculated .",
    "particles which do not appear to be bound are excluded from the potential calculation in the next stage .",
    "an accurate determination of the halo centers is important , since from a miss - centered halo we would deduce a systematically flattened profile .",
    "we use three centering methods : _",
    "i ) density maximum_. an algorithm for finding the density maximum uses an adaptive grid of cubes ; where the number of particles inside a cube exceeds a certain threshold , the cube is subdivided and the process iterates . _",
    "ii ) shrinking sphere center of mass _ , as in @xcite .",
    "here we calculate the center of mass ( com ) and then iterate , including at each stage only particles within some sphere around the previously calculated center . _",
    "iii ) potential minimum_. the particle with the minimum potential is chosen as the center .",
    "generally we find that the potential minimum lies within the convergence radius of the shrinking sphere center .",
    "all three alternative centering procedures are used ; if one procedure does not produce results within the convergence radius of each of the others , the halo is flagged as unusable for spherically averaged processing .",
    "we use the convergence criterion of @xcite to determine a central region where the density distribution is unreliable .",
    "this yields a convergence radius inside which the profile is not considered during the fitting procedure .",
    "we fit the density profiles using a standard @xmath24 minimization routine with a generalized nfw profile @xcite in which the concentration @xmath1 and inner slope @xmath0 are free parameters : @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is obvious that this parameterization of the profile should be regarded valid only between the virial radius and the convergence radius which , for all the halos considered in this work , is a constant fraction @xmath40% of the virial radius . in this paper",
    ", we use the poisson error for our @xmath24 minimization procedure .",
    "it is widely noted ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that errors introduced by deviations from an `` idealized '' equilibrium profile ( i.e. substructure , asphericity and irregularities ) are likely to be at least as important as poisson errors .",
    "when fitting the split power law to a halo , there is a degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 : the model is effectively constrained not to a point but to a line through the @xmath1-@xmath0 plane , along which @xmath24 varies by only a small factor @xmath41 from its minimum to the edges of the region of interest @xmath42 .",
    "the location of locus of minima varies widely from halo to halo and may select non - physical configurations with @xmath43 .",
    "perpendicular to this line , however , the value of @xmath24 increases rapidly . in figure",
    "[ fig : results - bestfitline ] left panel , we illustrate this degeneracy for the 10 most massive halos in r03 - 1 . by constraining either @xmath1 or @xmath0",
    "arbitrarily , each line can be reduced to a point , given by the intersection with a horizontal or vertical line respectively .",
    "when constraining @xmath44 , which gives nfw fits , the best - fit @xmath1 lies in the range @xmath45 . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the best fit @xmath0 lies in the range is a better estimate than the original value @xmath47 in r03 .",
    "we therefore adopt this value for obtaining numerical results ( table [ tab : fitresults - big ] ) . ]",
    "the results from the gadget2 runs ( gr03 , g256 and g512 ) were in excellent agreement with the r03 runs .    by using an analysis of the peak circular velocity , r03 found that recently virialized halos are well described by a constant concentration @xmath46 .",
    "this value was then used to break the profile fitting degeneracy , giving values of @xmath0 which agree with the theoretical prediction of @xcite for a range of halo masses from the various box sizes  for more details see the original r03 paper .",
    "when one uses circular velocity fitting , as in r03 , with a poisson assumption we obtain a smaller @xmath49 range .",
    "if we use density fitting with the nfw @xmath3 constraint , illustrated by a vertical line in figure [ fig : results - bestfitline ] , the first 40 halos in r03 - 1 give @xmath50 .",
    "this closely matches the results given in @xcite  who analyze their @xmath31 box at redshift @xmath33 instead of @xmath32  once corrected for redshift as @xmath51 as in @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the @xmath31 results are shown in table [ tab : fitresults - big ] ; all seem to be consistent and allow for fitting using either constraint .",
    "the increased mean @xmath24 in the g512 - 1 simulation occurs because the poisson errors are reduced ( more particles per bin ) while the systematics due to departures from the fitted split power - law profile are constant , since these arise through `` physical '' processes which are not greatly changed in magnitude by the change in resolution .",
    "[ sec : asympt ]    we now consider whether there is any evidence for differences between the @xmath31 and boxes and their @xmath52 and @xmath53 counterparts .",
    "the line of minimum @xmath24 for the 10 most massive regular halos in r03 - 32 and r03 - 256 is plotted in the middle and right panels of figure [ fig : results - bestfitline ] respectively .",
    "taking the 40 most massive halos and their intersections with the constraint @xmath46 gives @xmath54 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the nfw @xmath3 constraint gives @xmath56 and @xmath57 respectively .",
    "comparing with the @xmath58 results , there is a marginal difference in the @xmath34 results , and a clear difference in the @xmath35 results .",
    "the comparison simulations g256 - 32 , g256 - 256 and gr03 - 256 show the same trend with box size ( see table  [ tab : fitresults - big ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that neither the nfw profile plotted in figure 3 of r03 , nor the profiles with a shallower central slope @xmath59 have reached their asymptotic values at the convergence radii .",
    "the innermost resolved radii , however , satisfy @xmath60 , which can not be obtained by a true nfw profile ( which must have @xmath61 ) .",
    "unfortunately , using the density profile fitting we find that direct estimation of an individual profile s logarithmic slope yields results too noisy to perform direct analysis near the convergence radius , even with the higher resolution g512 simulations .      to circumvent the problems of the fitting degeneracy , we follow the method of @xcite .",
    "this procedure is similar to the one used by r03 where the circular velocities where analyzed instead of the density profiles .",
    "we make the assumption that the total mass interior to the convergence radius , @xmath62 , is representative of the `` physical '' halo , even if the inner profile is wrong .",
    "this being the case , @xmath63 gives a robust limit to the asymptotic power law of the halos : we can not have a steeper than @xmath64 cusp . the @xmath65  radius relation is plotted for some sample halos in figure [ fig : gamma ] .",
    "the g512 - 1 halos are resolved to smaller radii than the r03 run .",
    "the sets are in approximate agreement where their data overlaps , but the innermost point of the g512 profiles have @xmath66 , suggesting that the profile interior to @xmath62 would not be well described by nfw but probably in agreement wiht the latest high - resolution simulation results @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath62 is probably smaller than the cores which may have been observed in lsb ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . that said , @xcite have shown that the density profiles do provide good fits to the kinematic data from the draco local group dsph .",
    "in r03 , ricotti have claimed that central slopes of dark matter density profiles ( at a fixed fraction of the virial radius , dictated by the resolution of the simulation ) are correlated with halo mass and that the halo concentration at the redshift of virialization is a universal constant .",
    "this result is consistent with the finding of recent high - resolution simulations at @xmath9 @xcite in which is found that the slope of the density profile in halos become flatter with decreasing radius without converging to any asymphotic value .",
    "it s often a misconception that the results in r03 contradict several published papers .",
    "for example , merritt et al .",
    "( 2005 , 2006 ) found that the average inner slope for four dwarfs at @xmath9 with mass @xmath67 m@xmath68 is @xmath69 as compared with @xmath70 for 8 clusters .",
    "this does not contradict our result because clusters and dwarfs virialize at very different redshifts .",
    "the virial radius and concentration of dwarfs at @xmath9 has increased by a factor @xmath71 from the redshift of their formation , @xmath72 .",
    "hence , the inner slope we measure , _",
    "i.e_. , at 5%-10% of the virial radius in @xmath73 m@xmath68 halos at @xmath32 , should be compared to the slope at 0.5%-0.1% of the virial radius at @xmath9 in comparable mass dwarfs . in addition ,",
    "in the abstract of the same paper , they confirm a dependence of the halo profile on the halo mass , which is the main result in r03 .",
    "diemand , moore , steidel ( 2005 ) , found that in minihalos of mass @xmath74 m@xmath68 at @xmath75 the density profile has inner slope @xmath76 at 10% of the virial radius .",
    "but the number of particles in the three halos they look at is a factor of @xmath77 smaller than in our simulations .",
    "in addition the power spectrum of density fluctuations they use differs from ours as they use a power law with an exponential cut off at 0.6 parsec .",
    "it is not clear how the cut off in the power spectrum can affect the density profile .",
    "for example , contrary to our simulations , their halos do not have substructure .    here",
    ", we have re - analyzed the results presented in r03 and run new simulations showing that r03 results are reproducible by using different n - body codes , higher - resolution simulations , and different analysis techniques .",
    "part of the tension between r03 and previous results may be attributed to the method of analysis of the profiles .",
    "when fitting the density profiles , as is done in most of previous works , the fitting degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 does not allow one to understand whether is the slope @xmath0 or the concentration @xmath1 that depends on the mass of the dark halo .",
    "if one favors the @xcite scaling arguments which express a relation between @xmath0 and the initial power spectrum ( thus , between @xmath78 and the enclosed mass @xmath79 ) , it is found that the concentration of halos at the redshift of virialization is a universal constant .",
    "however , figure  [ fig : results - bestfitline ] shows that the r03 results can be re - parameterized by taking a different cut through the degeneracy , leading to the more widely accepted notion of the nfw concentration depending on the halo mass and epoch ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "r03 , by analyzing the circular velocities of small mass galaxies at @xmath80 , finds some evidence for cusps shallower than @xmath3 at radii @xmath81% of the virial radius ( in contradiction with nfw profiles ) . here , using a different non - parameterized analysis we also find some evidence for a flatter than @xmath3 power - law of the density profile within @xmath82% of the virial radius in galaxies with mass @xmath83 m@xmath68 at @xmath5 .",
    "note that the scaling argumennt in @xcite advocated by r03 suggests that the density profile does not converges toward any given asymptotic value of the logarithmic slope but rather becomes gradually flatter toward the center .",
    "this is in good agreement with the results of recent high - resolution simulations at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , the present work does not have sufficient resolution to investigate this hypothesis and compare the goodness of different shapes for the fitting function .",
