    "study of the stability of charged metal clusters against fragmentation is important in nano - sized systems . in this work ,",
    "we have studied the binary fragmentation of @xmath1-atom @xmath0-ply charged @xmath2 clusters in the framework of the liquid - drop @xcite model ( ldm ) with stabilized @xcite jellium model ( sjm ) coefficients for the energies . here ,",
    "@xmath0=1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ; and @xmath3 covers the species al , ga , li , na , k , and cs . here",
    ", in the case of al , when @xmath1 is a multiple of 3 , it corresponds to real al@xmath4 cluster with @xmath5 .",
    "the clusters are assumed to be spherical with sizes determined by @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 is the wigner - seitz radius of the electrons in the bulk metal .",
    "the possible decay channels of @xmath2 are    @xmath9    here , @xmath10 is positive integer as @xmath1 , and @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "different processes are defined by different values of @xmath12 .",
    "the process in which @xmath13 ( one of the fragments is neutral ) , is called evaporation . the processes in which @xmath14 are called charge - symmetric fission , and the charge - asymmetric fission is defined by @xmath15 $ ] . for any given set of values @xmath1 , @xmath0 , @xmath12 , different values of @xmath10 define different decay channels . in a particular decay channel of the evaporation processes , the negativity of the difference between total energies before and after the fragmentation ,    @xmath16    is sufficient for the decaying in that particular channel . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are the total energies of @xmath0-ply ionized and neutral @xmath1-atom clusters , respectively .",
    "however , in fission processes a negative value for the difference energy is not a sufficient condition for the decay of the parent cluster .",
    "this is because , the competition between the short - range surface tension and the long - range repulsive coulomb force may give rise to a fission barrier . the heights of the fission barriers",
    "are calculated using the two - spheres approximation@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the fission of a @xmath0-ply charged @xmath1-atom cluster into two clusters of respective sizes @xmath19 , @xmath20 and respective charges @xmath12 , @xmath21 is schematically shown .",
    "@xmath22 is the energy release , @xmath23 is the fusion barrier ( or coulomb barrier ) which is the maximum energy of the coulomb interaction of two positively - charged conducting spheres , taking their polarizabilities into account .",
    "@xmath24 is the fission barrier height which is defined as    @xmath25    the coulomb interaction energy , @xmath26 , as a function of their separations , @xmath27 , for two charged metallic spheres can be numerically calculated using the classical method of image charges @xcite .",
    "the most favored decay channel in evaporation processes is defined as the channel for which the dissociation energy assumes its minimum value    @xmath28    and the most favored decay channel in fission processes is defined as the channel for which the fission - barrier height assumes its minimum value ,    @xmath29    the energy of an @xmath1-atom @xmath0-ply charged cluster in the ldm is given @xcite by    @xmath30    in which @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are the work function of the bulk metal , the finite - size correction to the work function , the radius of the cluster , and the electron charge , respectively . for simplicity , the position of the centroid of excess charge , @xmath35 , is neglected in our calculations .",
    "@xmath18 is the energy of a neutral @xmath1-atom cluster in the ldm , which is given by    @xmath36    in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) , the quantities @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are total energy per electron of the bulk , surface energy , and curvature energy , respectively .",
    "we have calculated the quantities @xmath32 , @xmath31 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 by fitting to the self - consistent kohn - sham @xcite results in the sjm for different @xmath40 values @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath37 is calculated using the sjm energy expression for the bulk system ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) of ref . [",
    "[ payamijpc01 ] ] ) .",
    "using the method of image charges , we have calculated the coulomb interaction energy of two charged metallic spheres , taking their polarizabilities into account .",
    "the calculations show that the maximum of the interaction energy , @xmath23 , is achieved for a separation @xmath41 .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows the coulomb interaction energy of an @xmath19-atom cluster with another @xmath42-atom of respective excess charges @xmath43 and @xmath44=1 .",
    "the radii of the clusters are calculated from @xmath6 , as in the sjm . in this figure , we have taken @xmath8=2.07 which correspond to bulk al . when both @xmath19 and @xmath42 are multiples of 3 , the results correspond to real al clusters .",
    "the value at the maximum specifies the quantity @xmath23 , and the position of the maximum , @xmath45 , is the separation between the centers of the two spheres . as is seen , for fixed values of charges",
    ", @xmath23 is the highest when the sizes are equal . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) , the situation is shown for equal charges @xmath46 . in this case , when the sizes are equal , @xmath23 is maximum as before but here , @xmath47 .",
    "an other feature shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) is that , when both charges and sizes are asymmetric , @xmath23 is higher if the smaller charge corresponds to the smaller cluster . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , we have compared the coulomb interaction energies of two al metallic spheres with respective sizes @xmath48 and @xmath49 for different charges . it is seen that keeping the sizes fixed but increasing the charge on any one of them , without changing the charge on the other one , increases the height of the maximum .    in our calculations",
    "we need the values of the coulomb interaction energy at the maxima points , i.e. , the @xmath23s . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , we have compared the @xmath23 values for equally charged @xmath50 , al metallic particles but with different radii @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this figure shows that when both of the sizes are small , the barrier is higher than the case when at least one of them is larger . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , we have compared the @xmath23s for singly ionized pairs al , na , and cs with different values of @xmath19 and @xmath42 . in the aluminum case , since the radii of the spheres are smaller than those of na and so on , their polarizabilities are thereby smaller and thus the al values lie above that of na , and so on .",
    "now , if the charge on one of the clusters is increased without changing that of the other one , the arrangement of the curves would not change but they shift upward according to fig . [ fig2](d ) .    in the energy calculations of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) we use the results obtained for @xmath32 and @xmath31 in ref . [ [ payami_aw ] ] .",
    "the values of @xmath37 are calculated using eq .",
    "( 1 ) of ref . [",
    "[ payamijpc01 ] ] for unpolarized case . @xmath38 and @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) are obtained by fitting the results of the self - consistent solutions of the kohn - sham equations in the sjm for neutral clusters of sizes @xmath7 , and different @xmath40 values .",
    "the values of @xmath8 for al , ga , li , na , k , and cs are 2.07 , 2.19 , 3.28 , 3.99 , 4.96 , and 5.63 , respectively . in figs .",
    "[ fig4](a)-(c ) we have plotted the sjm values of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , as functions of @xmath40 , respectively .    to show the variations of the dissociation energy , @xmath53 , for different charging and different evaporation channels , we have plotted , in figs . [ fig5](a)-(b ) , the quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , as functions of the neutral fragment size , @xmath10 , for li . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , for small @xmath10 values @xmath54 has an increasing behavior , then after passing a maximum , it changes to a decreasing behavior , and finally , for large @xmath10 values it increases again .",
    "this behavior has its roots in the trade off between the surface energy ( the volume energy term does not change in the fragmentation process ) and the last term of eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) . for small @xmath10 , the surface area difference    @xmath56,\\ ] ]    increases , and then for intermediate @xmath10 values , it assumes a maximum , and finally decreases .",
    "the increasing behavior at the tail is because , with increasing @xmath10 , the size of the singly ionized fragment decreases and hence , beyond a certain @xmath10 value , the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) dominates the surface energy term .",
    "however , beyond a @xmath0 value for the parent cluster , the last term of the eq .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) dominates the surface energy term for smaller @xmath10 values before @xmath53 reaches its maximum as in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "in fact , we have found that for li@xmath57 this transition takes place at a point @xmath58 .",
    "the value of @xmath59 depends on @xmath1 .",
    "this dependence is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) by the fact that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are increasing functions of p in the whole range .",
    "the dissociation energy @xmath53 for small @xmath62 takes the form    @xmath63    which specifies the most favored channel in an evaporation process with @xmath64 .",
    "this means that , in evaporation processes , the parent charged cluster prefers to evaporate single atoms than larger neutral clusters .",
    "this fact is also numerically shown in figs . [ fig5](a)-(b ) .",
    "on the other hand , the positivity of @xmath53 in the whole range implies that the parent charged cluster is stable against any spontaneous evaporation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we have plotted the most favored dissociation energies , @xmath65 , of na clusters as functions of the parent size , @xmath1 , for different @xmath0 values .",
    "the results show that for large enough clusters , the dissociation energy is independent of @xmath0 , which is consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) . however , for small clusters , the dissociation energy increases with charge .",
    "figures [ fig7](a)-(b ) compares the most favored dissociation energies of different species for @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "it is seen that detachment of a single atom from a lower electron density cluster is easier , i.e. , it needs less energy . comparing these two figures",
    "also shows that , although the hierarchy is the same , the dissociation energies are shifted to higher energies as we go from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "now , we consider the fission processes .",
    "we first consider the following two cases :    @xmath68    @xmath69    processes ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) describe charge - symmetric and charge - asymmetric fissions , respectively . in figs .",
    "[ fig8](a ) and [ fig8](b ) we have plotted their respective fission barriers , @xmath70 , for @xmath71 as functions of @xmath10 , for different sizes of the parent . as is seen in both of these figures",
    ", there exists a minimum size for the parent , @xmath72 , beyond which the fission barrier height is positive in all possible channels of that particular process . that is , the parent cluster @xmath73 with @xmath74 is stable against any spontaneous fission via that particular process .",
    "one of the significant differences in the charge - symmetric and charge - asymmetric fission is that [ as seen in figs . [ fig8](a ) and [ fig8](b ) ] , in the most favored channel , the products have more or less the same sizes in the former case ; whereas , in the latter case the less charged fragment assumes quite smaller sizes .",
    "that is , the charge - symmetric fission proceeds mostly via mass - symmetric channel , and the charge - asymmetric fission does it via mass - asymmetric channel . in fig .",
    "[ fig8](c ) , we compare the most favored sizes , @xmath75 , for the charge - symmetric and charge - asymmetric fission of na@xmath76 .",
    "it is seen that in the charge - symmetric case , @xmath75 increases with @xmath1 whereas , in the charge - asymmetric case it remains more or less constant .    to decide whether a cluster with a given size and charge , @xmath77 , is stable against any spontaneous decay , one should compare @xmath1 with the quantity    @xmath78    if @xmath79 , then the cluster @xmath73 is stable against any spontaneous decay . to show the values of @xmath72 schematically",
    ", we plot the most favored fission barriers , @xmath80 for all possible @xmath12 values .",
    "the evaporation processes need not be considered because , as was shown before , in the ldm there is no spontaneous decay via evaporation .",
    "however , in order to determine at what size which process is dominant , we include the most favored evaporation process as well .",
    "it should be mentioned that , in the self - consistent kohn - sham results @xcite , because of the shell effects , the spontaneous evaporation is also possible .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we have compared the most favored fission barriers , @xmath81 , of ga@xmath76 for @xmath82 and @xmath83 with the most favored dissociation energy , @xmath84 .",
    "we have labeled the intersection points of the curves with each other and with the horizontal @xmath1 axis by a , b , c , d , and e. at point a , the charge - symmetric and charge - asymmetric fission start their competition ; thus we name the corresponding size as @xmath85 . for clusters",
    "@xmath86 with @xmath87 , the charge - symmetric fission is dominant whereas for larger sizes charge - asymmetric one dominates .",
    "we name the size corresponding to the point b as @xmath88 because for sizes greater than this there is no charge - symmetric spontaneous fission .",
    "however , spontaneous fission via charge - asymmetric process still persists for @xmath89 . beyond the size @xmath90 which corresponds to the point c",
    ", the spontaneous charge - asymmetric fission also stops .",
    "our results show that , for small @xmath40 values , @xmath91 whereas , for @xmath92 , the reverse inequality is at work ( as in the cases of k and cs ) .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) , if @xmath93 , then any spontaneous fission stops and the cluster @xmath86 would be stable against any spontaneous decay . at sizes",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 which correspond , respectively , to the points d and e , competition of the evaporation with charge - symmetric and charge - asymmetric fission starts , respectively . beyond the size    @xmath96    the dominant decay process is evaporation .",
    "our results show that , at least for @xmath97 , the inequality @xmath98 is satisfied .",
    "when @xmath99 , the decay processes consist of evaporation and charge - asymmetric fission whereas , for @xmath100 , the fission is a charge - symmetric one .    in figs .",
    "[ fig10](a ) and ( b ) , we compare the most favored fission barrier heights @xmath101 and @xmath102 for different species , respectively .",
    "the figures indicate that , for large enough clusters , the fission barriers are higher for higher electron density metals .    in fig .",
    "[ fig11](a ) , we compare the smallest stable sizes , @xmath103 for different species .",
    "looking at the figure , one concludes that , for fixed @xmath1 , the higher electron density metal clusters ( say al ) has less capacity for charging than the lower density metal clusters ( say cs ) .",
    "this behavior is observed for all @xmath104 .    to show the size beyond which evaporation dominates all decay processes , we plot @xmath105 with @xmath106 for all species in fig . [ fig11](b ) .",
    "it is seen that , for fixed charge , @xmath0 , the evaporation process dominates at smaller @xmath1 values for lower electron density metal clusters . the trends in figs .",
    "[ fig11](a ) and [ fig11](b ) are seen to be the same .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig11](c ) , we compare the @xmath85 , the size at which the competition between the charge - symmetric and charge - asymmetric fission starts .",
    "this size decreases from al to li , and then increases from li to k , and finally decreases from k to cs . in the plot",
    ", we have taken into account the decimals for the intersection points which can be rounded to the next nearest integer .",
    "in this work , we have studied the stability of @xmath0-ply charged ( @xmath107 ) metal clusters of species al , ga , li , na , k , and cs using the liquid - drop model with stabilized jellium model energies .",
    "fragmentation of clusters into smaller ones can proceed via evaporation or fission .",
    "our results show that , in the ldm , any charged cluster is stable against spontaneous evaporation , and the most favored channel of induced fragmentation depends on the size and the charge of the parent cluster .",
    "sufficiently small multiply charged clusters , however , may undergo spontaneous fragmentation via different fission processes .",
    "we have obtained , for each species , the smallest size that a @xmath0-ply charged cluster is stable against any spontaneous fragmentation .",
    "we have also shown that , for sufficiently large clusters the most favored decay channel is atomic evaporation . comparing",
    "the results for different species show that , for fixed @xmath1 , the lower electron density clusters have higher capacity for charging .",
