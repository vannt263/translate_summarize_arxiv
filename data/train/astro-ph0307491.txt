    "the observation of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) has now spanned nearly three decades . over that period , many different source models have been proposed to explain the origin of these remarkable events .",
    "recently , the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) reported clustering at small angular scales for the events that were observed above @xmath2  ev @xcite .",
    "however , this result could not be confirmed by the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) air fluorescence detector @xcite despite the fact that hires - i s monocular exposure was more than twice that of agasa within the pertinent energy range @xcite .",
    "agasa has also reported a possible excess of events in the direction of the galactic center for events with energies around @xmath3  ev @xcite .",
    "however , hires reported that it did _ not _ see anisotropies when examining harmonics in right ascension , _ a priori _ determined point sources , or enhancement in the supergalactic plane .",
    "furthermore , prior analysis by the the original fly s eye showed no evidence of anisotropies when dependencies in galactic latitude and longitude , harmonics in right ascension , excess maps , and specific _ a priori _ determined point sources were examined @xcite .",
    "however , fly s eye did find a small apparent excess in the direction of the galactic plane .",
    "@xcite . in 1995 , it was reported by stanev _",
    "_ that the combined data of haverah park , yakutsk , and agasa showed an excess along the supergalactic plane with several potential point sources for events above @xmath4  ev @xcite .",
    "these conflicting reports call for developing a more global way in which one could determine if a given sample possesses any statistically significant anisotropy",
    ". we will show that by considering the information dimension , @xmath1 , of a given sample , one can simultaneously look for anisotropies at all angular scales greater than the angular resolution of the sample by considering the intrinsic heterogeneity of that particular data sample .",
    "this method is quite robust in that it can easily accommodate both asymmetric angular resolutions and irregular apertures .",
    "furthermore , in the event that a sample is shown to be consistent with an isotropic distribution , this method can be used to place upper limits on possible source models . because only a single measurement is taken of the actual data , any number of source models can be considered simultaneously without incurring statistical penalties .",
    "fractal dimensionality is a simple measure of the scaling symmetry of a structure . by measuring the fractal dimension of a data sample",
    ", one can examine its self - consistency at different levels of magnification .",
    "there are several ways of exploiting this idea . from a computational perspective ,",
    "the simplest is to use box - counting . for the most general case ,",
    "the capacity dimension , @xmath5 @xcite , one partitions the sample space into equi - sized and equi - shaped `` boxes '' with edge size @xmath6 : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the minimum number of `` boxes '' with edge size @xmath6 necessary to cover one s sample .",
    "the capacity dimension has a serious limitation : it only looks for the presence of the sample within the available space and does not consider variations in the density of the sample at a given point in space . in cases where the density may differ within the sample space ,",
    "the appropriate alternative is to use the information dimension , @xmath1 @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the probability of finding a data point in the @xmath11-th box of edge size @xmath6 .",
    "this is a particularly suitable measurement when considering a data set consisting of uhecr arrival directions with finite angular resolution .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath12 and @xmath1 are both particular cases of the @xmath13-dimension @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 we can then see that @xmath16 and that @xmath17 .",
    "in principle , it is simple to calculate the information dimension for a given sample of events .",
    "however , two complications arise when considering a set of arrival directions of uhecrs .",
    "first , the event directions are not known with complete precision .",
    "this makes the determination of @xmath1 as @xmath18 meaningless .",
    "secondly , the determination of @xmath1 requires that the sample space be divided into equi - sized and equi - shaped bins . for a spherical surface , this is simply not possible . nevertheless , there are workable solutions for both of these problems",
    ".      we will consider a hypothetical monocular air - fluorescence detector .",
    "this detector is largely based upon the characteristics of the hires - i detector @xcite .",
    "our detector observes events with an angular resolution that is described by a highly asymmetric 2-d gaussian .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "fractal dimensionality has several advantages over conventional anisotropy techniques .",
    "first of all , it naturally accommodates angular resolution .",
    "this is extremely important when considering event sets with asymmetric errors , when analysing event sets with variable values for the angular resolution ( e.g. dependent on energy or geometry ) , or when combining multiple data sets from different detectors for a single analysis .",
    "another advantage that fractal dimensionality possesses is the ability to accommodate any aperture . because this method makes a relative comparison between a sample and simulations using the same aperture , the physical aperture is simply folded into the analysis .",
    "this once again allows the combination of data from multiple detectors with _ very _ different apertures .",
    "it also allows the analysis of extremely complicated apertures without the need to include normalizing factors that needlessly complicate the predictability of the poisson fluctuations in the data sample .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature of the fractal dimensionality method is that it only requires a _ single _ measurement of one s data . while fractal dimensionality will not always provide better statistical significance than a direct measurement for a specific anisotropy , the fact that one considers only a single measurement of the data , for any number of potential anisotropic models , provides one the means to simultaneously reject or accept all of those models without the ensuing statistical penalty .",
    "a possible way of increasing the sensitivity of the fractal dimensionality method is by considering the general case of case of @xmath19 . by varying the value of @xmath13 to something other than @xmath20 ,",
    "it might be possible to increase the sensitivity of this method to various anisotropies .",
    "the fractal dimensionality method does have some weaknesses .",
    "first and foremost is the potential for multiple solutions as was demonstrated in the dipole source model above .",
    "the method can not be applied blindly .",
    "it requires a careful inspection of both the data sample and the simulated samples in order to resolve possible ambiguities .",
    "another drawback is the amount of computation required to calculate @xmath1 for a large number of simulated data sets .",
    "producing just the plots in figure  [ figure : dipoledi]c consumed the equivalent of @xmath21  cpu hours on 1ghz athlon machine .",
    "another limitation is the potential for different source models to effectively cancel each other out and yield a potentially deceiving value of @xmath1 that resembles that of an isotropic source .",
    "one solution for this is to separately consider the value of @xmath1 for different celestial regions in the data . of course , this will incur a statistical penalty .",
    "two particularly useful roles for fractal dimensionality analysis are ( a ) : as a first test to ascertain if a sample possesses the same heterogeneity as the expected isotropic background and ( b ) : as a wholly independent observable that can be used to confirm the results of a direct measurement .",
    "today the hires detector continues to accumulate data .",
    "soon the auger detector will be acquiring data at seven times the rate of hires .",
    "as the number of observed uhecrs continues to rise , fractal dimensionality will grow ever more effective in its ability to discern the between potential source models in the continuing effort to solve the mystery of uhecrs .",
    "this work is supported by us nsf grants phy-9321949 phy-9974537 , and phy-0140688 .",
    "we would like to thank professors glennys farrar and benjamin bromley for invaluable insights that went into the analysis used to produce this paper .",
