    "collective rotational bands and backbending in @xmath5cr were described performing shel model calculations in the full @xmath14 valence shell @xcite . for heavier nuclei , like the neutron - rich cr , mn , fe and co isotopes , it has been necessary to include the intruder @xmath15 @xcite . the shell model description of the growing experimental evidence for collective behavior of cr and fe isotopes with @xmath16 40 required the additional inclusion of @xmath17 orbital @xcite .",
    "while moving to heavier nuclei it was natural to exclude the @xmath3 orbital from the valence space , to understand in a shell model context recent experimental findings in ga isotopes @xcite , both the proton @xmath3 and neutron @xmath18 orbitals were required @xcite .",
