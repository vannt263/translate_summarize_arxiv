    "the case of a semiconductor electron - hole plasma @xcite , i.e. a two - component system , represents the next level of complexity .",
    "one of the first attempts to treat such case consisted of introducing a variational parameter to characterize the total plasma screening in order to compute numerically the ground state of an electron - hole pair @xcite .",
    "a multiband plasmon - pole approximation was used in ref .",

    "more recently the total plasma screening was defined as the sum of the separate contributions of each carrier gas in studies of the statistical mechanics and ionization degree of the mixed exciton / electron - hole gas in quasi - equilibrium @xcite , and ultrafast relaxation of nonequilibrium spin - polarized electron - hole plasma @xcite .",

    "neglect of this key aspect of the electrostatic problem surely has an impact on the amplitudes of the computed interaction matrix elements .",
    "in addition , if systems are characterized by an important dielectric mismatch , this may possibly affect some of the conclusions of the works .",

    "i_/ ` electron - electron ' within the same quantum wells ( intrawell interaction ) , _",
    "ii_/ ` electron - electron ' , each being part of a gas residing in one of the two separate quantum wells ( interwell interaction ) ; and _ iii_/ ` electron - exciton ' , with the electron and exciton gases being in one of the two separate quantum wells ( interwell interaction ) .",
    "the calculation of these interactions will take into account the dielectric mismatches at the layers interfaces .",
    "an exact analytic solution to such kind of electrostatic problems is obviously out of reach , and a full computational treatment based on the numerical integration of the poisson equation with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces , also highly desirable , would need to be tested against analytical results derived from simplified models . therefore , a realistic goal is to obtain a description of the processes at work and estimates for the amplitudes of the interaction matrix elements considering a simple approach involving standard arguments from classical electrodynamics and quantum mechanics .    the article is organized as follows : in section ii , brief reviews of the model of statically screened coulomb interactions in an ideal quantum well , and the method of image charges to account for the influence of the polarization effects induced by the dielectric mismatch , are given ; section iii is devoted to the derivations of the analytical formulas for the screened ( intra- and interwell ) electron - electron interactions ; the interaction of an electron gas in a quantum well with a neutral exciton gas in a separate parallel quantum well is the object of section iv .",
    "the obtained interactions are compared with the published ones and discussed .",
    "modulation - doped semiconductor quantum wells are considered .",
    "the doping is assumed to be sufficiently small so that the dielectric constants of the barriers materials do not differ much from those of the wells ( such systems are routinely designed , taking , e.g. , gaas as the well material and algaas as the barrier material ) . the model system considered for the present work is composed of two such quantum wells , labeled 1 and 2 , which are parallel and separated by a dielectric layer of thickness @xmath8 and dielectric constant @xmath9 , as depicted in fig .",

    "the electron effective mass is @xmath24 .",
    "the full rpa dielectric function exhibits a continuum of poles . as a consequence",

    "practical applications show that it is often sufficient to use the much simpler static plasmon - pole approximation instead of the full rpa dielectric function to obtain good qualitative results .      as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ stack ] , the main difficulty to determine the screened coulomb potentials in the quantum wells arises from the discrete layered structure of the system characterized by abrupt changes of the dielectric constants at the interfaces .",
    "a dielectric mismatch always induces polarization effects that must be accounted for .",
    "for instance , the role of dielectric mismatch has been evidenced in the obervation of the reduction in the charging energy of the shallow state of a negatively charged dopant in silicon@xcite .",
    "the method of images from classical electrostatics @xcite is very well suited for such type of problems and it has been succesfully adapted in the framework of the gw approach to the study of the two - dimensional dielectric screening in systems formed of repeated layers of different dielectric materials @xcite .",
    "the method of images is best explained following the standard textbook case @xcite of the two semi - infinite dielectric media , each characterized by a dielectric constant , @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , and separated by a plane interface . assuming the presence of an electric charge @xmath31 located at @xmath32 in the medium 1 , the electrostatic potential at @xmath33 is    @xmath34    if @xmath33 is in the medium 1 , in which case @xmath35 is the image of @xmath33 through the interface ; and    @xmath36    if @xmath33 is in the medium 2 . imposing continuity at the interface for both the electric field and electrostatic potential yields :    @xmath37    @xmath38    the charge images",
    "are thus of two kinds , the `` transmitted '' image charge , @xmath39 , located at the point opposite to that of @xmath31 with respect to the interface plane , and the `` reflected '' image charge , @xmath40 , which is located at the same point as @xmath31 .",
    "these image charges are merely convenient mathematical objects used to compute the electrostatic potentials and have no physical reality .",
    "the justification of this method comes from the _ uniqueness theorem _ @xcite , which states that for a given set of boundary conditions there can only be one unique solution to the electrostatic problem .",
    "therefore the potentials and computed with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and respectively , are the correct ones .",
    "let us now turn to the structure in fig . [ stack ] .",
    "following the analysis above , the first and second order image charges are obtained in a fashion similar to the iterative scheme of ref .",

    "the last step is to add in an _ ad hoc _ fashion the effective screening parameter , which contains the contributions of the electronic charge @xmath46 and its images .    since @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96",

    "the problem is more involved than the previous one since it concerns the evaluation of the interaction between two screened charges that are part of two separate electron gases with possibly different properties .",
    "we thus have to account for the dielectric mismatch and the screening effects in a consistent fashion .",

    "it is obvious from the expression above that @xmath147 ; but if one accounts for the coulomb screening in each separate well directly by introducing the two effective screening parameters @xmath148 and @xmath149 in @xmath150 and @xmath151 respectively , as done in eq .  , the equality of the potentials is violated . a convenient way to circumvent this problem",
    "is to consider that , in the same way as the effective dielectric constant @xmath152 is defined , @xmath152 , one may also construct an effective static dielectric function @xmath153/2 $ ] , which explicitely reads :    @xmath154    where the screening parameters @xmath155 are defined as follows :    @xmath156    the parameters @xmath155 contain the effects of the dielectric mismatch through the presence of @xmath152 in their calculation .",
    "therefore , the effective static dielectric function @xmath157 describes the mutual screened interaction of a charge of an electron gas with a charge of a separate , distinct electron gas , accounting for the different background dielectric constants of each system .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath158 , the screening parameter @xmath159 does not ( and should not ) reduce to @xmath160 . in the present case , we seek to evaluate the screening felt by a test charge in a quantum well induced by an electron gas located in a separate and distant quantum well ; the problem studied in section [ eeintsec ] is indeed quite different .",

    "both amplitudes are of the same order of magnitude , but unlike for the intrawell interactions , they do not cross each other : @xmath165 is smaller than @xmath166 for all @xmath127 .",
    "this shows that neglecting the polarization effects induced by the dielectric mismatch in the layered system , yields an overestimation of the interwell screened electron - electron interaction , which becomes increasingly important with @xmath127 .",

    "note that if the effective masse of the electron in the quantum well 1 is different from that of the bound electron in the quantum well 2 , the electron - exciton scattering matrix element contains only a direct term , which takes the following form @xcite :    @xmath179,\\ ] ]    where @xmath180 is the fourier transform of the square of the wave function representing the relative motion of the bound electron - hole pair , and the parameters @xmath181 and @xmath182 are given by @xmath183 .",

    "the situation is reversed as the wavenumber @xmath127 increases ; again this is due to the stronger @xmath167-dependence of @xmath189 , which tends to lower very rapidly its amplitude .",

    "it is based on a number of approximations but it yields useful analytical formulas for intrawell and interwell screened interactions , which can easily be implemented in a computer code .",
    "the formulas may be employed either to develop simple models of phenomena involving screened coulomb interactions or to study limiting cases of more involved calculations for realistic models .",
    "one of the main ( implicit ) assumptions is that the layered system does not interact with the environment within which it is embedded ; in other words , from the electrostatic viewpoint , it is as though the two semiconductor layers were semi - infinite .",

    "modulation - doped semiconductor quantum wells were considered assuming that the dielectric mismatches between the wells and barriers materials were small enough to neglect the effects of image charges in the barriers .",
    "extension of the present model to cases involving either important barrier doping or dielectric quantum wells characterized by important dielectric mismatch , is in principle possible in the spirit of previously published works @xcite .",
    "these works were focused on the enhancement of the exciton binding energies and nonlinear optical properties of dielectric quantum wells , but did not account for coulomb screening .    finally ,",
    "as mentionned in the introduction , the scope of the present work is restricted to quasi - thermal equilibrium situations for which the static limit is often used as a useful approximation , though it yields an overestimation of the rpa coulomb self energies .",
    "use of the dynamically screened coulomb interaction permits predictive simulations of the properties of structures which are more complex than idealized quantum wells considered in the present article .",
    "dynamical coulomb screening is an essential feature of microscopic models of non - equilibrium systems for which a proper account of electron - electron scattering is necessary to compute the carrier distributions .",
    "a comparison of static and dynamic screening models indeed shows that the former model yields a spurious divergence of the scattering rates in the limit of small momentum transfer , while no such divergence problem occurs with the latter model@xcite .",
    "numerical implementations of such sophisticated models , based on the nonequilibrium green s function formalism @xcite , may represent a difficult task but they yield results in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "the model presented in this article yields static screening parameters which account for the image charges induced by dielectric mismatch and the geometry of the considered system through forms factors .",
    "application of the analytical formulas obtained for the screened coulomb interactions in the present work and comparison to recently published models evidences non - negligible discrepancies .",
    "if one considers a layered structure with very small dielectric mismatch , one should not expect important consequences on the published results and conclusions @xcite , but it can be seen as worthwhile to make use of the simple formulas derived in the present article for the modeling of structures , which exhibit strong dielectric mismatch .",
