    "in particular , it was stressed that inflation typically ends , in the hybrid case , _ before the inflaton reaches the waterfall region_.    so - called models of hybrid inflation@xcite have in common the last feature above ; in @xcite it was argued that this full set of conditions should be taken as the definition of hybrid inflation .    within such models , these authors noted general features :    1 .",

    "terms allowed by the discrete symmetry break the accidental continuous global symmetry and spoil inflation , unless the inflationary scale ( the square of the goldstino decay constant ) is sufficiently small .",
    "4 .   there are further requirements on the potential in order to obtain slow roll inflation with adequate @xmath6-foldings .",
    "this sets an _",
    "irreducible _ minimum amount of fine tuning necessary to achieve acceptable inflation .",
    "this tuning grows in severity with the number of hubble mass fields .",
    "5 .   in order that inflation ends with small c.c . , the inflaton must couple , as noted above , to other light degrees of freedom , or must have appreciable self - couplings in the final ground state .",
    "the coupling to this extra field , or the self couplings , are fixed by the density perturbations @xmath7 and the inflationary scale . in the case of extra fields ,",
    "the resulting structure is necessarily what is called",
    " hybrid inflation\"@xcite .",
    "the spectral index , quite generally , is less than one .    in @xcite , it was noted that for a broad range of parameters , @xmath0 was typical ; this is widely considered a general result of hybrid models .",
    "recently , considering the planck cmb temperature data supplemented by the wmap large - scale polarization data , the planck collaboration has reported a value  @xcite : n_s = 0.9603 0.0073 . and",
    "indeed , the authors of the planck papers argued that their data excludes hybrid inflation . within the definition outlined above ,",
    "it is interesting to look more carefully at the range of allowed values of @xmath8 .    in this paper , we systematically consider various planck scale corrections to the simplest version of hybrid inflation .",
    "we explain why ( parametrically ) the most important are the quartic corrections to the potential , and certain power law corrections to the superpotential .",
    "the former must be suppressed by an amount of order @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of @xmath6-foldings . the latter lead to an approximately zero c.c . , supersymmetric minimum for large fields ; in turn this means that the potential has a local maximum ( saddle ) .",
    "this gives rise to a variant of ",
    "hilltop inflation\"@xcite ; we will see that the initial conditions need not be substantially tuned in order that one obtain adequate @xmath6-foldings and @xmath11 .",
    "if the superpotential has coefficient scaled by a suitable power of @xmath12 and a dimensionless coefficient of order one , one obtains a _ prediction _ of the scale of inflation .",
    "the scale depends on the index @xmath13 of a @xmath14 @xmath5 symmetry , and ranges from about @xmath15 gev to @xmath16 gev .    in the next section ,",
    "we review the simplest hybrid model , and recall the prediction @xmath0 . in section [ hierarchy ] , we classify the various planck scale corrections to the simplest hybrid model . in section [ wr ] ,",
    "we consider the implications of the leading superpotential corrections for inflation , explaining why one obtains the structure of hilltop inflation . in section",
    "[ numerical ] , we present numerical results for these models . in section [ susybreaking ]",
    ", we suggest that predictions might arise if inflation is connected with supersymmetry breaking . in section [ conclusions ] , we conclude by considering possible observable consequences of this picture .",

    "this treatment , however , is oversimplified . already , in @xcite ,",

    "was treated as small , but a number of other effects were considered .",
    "so it is first worthwhile to consider the various possible corrections in powers of @xmath23 , and their relative importance .",
    "first , it is generally believed that theories of gravity should not exhibit continuous global symmetries ; in string theories , this is a theorem .",
    "replacing the continuous @xmath5 symmetry by a discrete @xmath14 symmetry allows corrections of the form w_r= 2(n+1 ) s^n+1 m_p^n-2 .",
    "more generally , our viewpoint will be that all terms allowed in the effective action below @xmath12 should appear with order one coefficients ; we will assume that smaller coefficients represent a  fine tuning \" of parameters .",
    "we can systematically consider types of corrections , ordered in powers of @xmath23 :    1 .",
    "potential corrections : @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "superpotential corrections : in addition to @xmath26 ( and higher powers of @xmath17 , other fields ) , at some level there must be a constant in the superpotential , @xmath27 , to account for the smallness of the cosmological constant now .",
    "3 .   supersymmetry breaking effects .    the term k = m_p^2(s^s)^2 has been noted already in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "precise limits on @xmath28 ( of order @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of @xmath6-foldings ) were discussed .",
    "it was noted that the quantum corrections of eqn . only dominate over this potential correction for sufficiently small @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , as we will review shortly , for the simplest model , the quantum corrections _ never _ dominate unless @xmath22 is quite small .",
    "terms of sixth order or higher in @xmath17 in the potential are irrelevant .",
    "they lead to highly suppressed contributions to @xmath29 and @xmath19 , for example",
    ". we will be more quantitative about this question when we turn to models that can reproduce the planck value of @xmath8 .",
    "now we turn to the various superpotential corrections .",
    "our definition of hybrid inflation is motivated by the hypothesis that the scale of inflation is large compare to scales of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "this means , in particular , that m_3/2=w_0 m_p^2 h_i with @xmath30 the hubble scale during inflation . as a result ,",
    "terms in the potential arising from @xmath27 can be neglected during inflation .",
    "if , in fact , the actual value of @xmath31 is comparable to @xmath3 , then this term , and terms associated with supersymmetry breaking , would be important .",
    "even for @xmath32 tev , this corresponds to an inflationary energy scale well below @xmath33 gev .",
    "so finally we turn , again , to @xmath26 .",
    "the presence of this term in the superpotential gives rise to a supersymmetric minimum of the potential at @xmath17 large but parametrically smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "this is unlike the case , for example , of higher order corrections to the potential . as a result",
    ", this term qualitatively alters the behavior of the system , for large but not planck scale fields . in @xcite this term was used to constrain features of inflation . requiring that it was not important during inflation constrained the scale of inflation , and lead to the prediction @xmath20 . to be compatible with the results from planck , however , it is clearly necessary that inflation occur in a region near the local maximum ( as in ",
    "hilltop inflation\"@xcite )",
    ". we will explore this in the next section .",
    "including @xmath26 , it is first important that the system not flow towards the supersymmetric minimum . indeed , for an intermediate range of field values , there are corrections to the potential of the form v_r = ^2 s^n m_p^n-2 + c.c . for negative @xmath34 ,",
    "this leads to a maximum , for s^n m_p^n-2 . to obtain suitable inflation ,",
    "it is necessary that @xmath17 be smaller than this at the beginning .",
    "but , given eqn .",
    ", except for very large @xmath13 , @xmath17 is smaller than the  waterfall value \" , s_w = .    as a result of these considerations ,",
    "the simplest ( and rather standard ) model of hybrid inflation ( allowing for @xmath26 ) does not appear suitable . in @xcite ,",
    "a simple modification was suggested with two fields , @xmath17 and @xmath35 , with couplings at the renormalizable level : w = s(^2 - ^2 ) + i ^+  [ modifiedhybrid ] the theory , classically , has two flat directions , one with large @xmath17 , one with large @xmath35 . as in the previous model , in order that inflation occur , the potential must be tuned so that at least one of the fields @xmath17 or @xmath35 , has mass small compared to the hubble constant during inflation , @xmath30 . to obtain a workable model , we require that @xmath35 be the light field",
    ". this amounts to requiring that in the potential term k = @xmath28 should be close to unity .",
    "the waterfall regime is now at smaller value of the inflaton field @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and hybrid inflation can be driven by the quantum and discrete symmetry corrections .    assuming a discrete @xmath5 symmetry , there are a variety of possible higher dimension terms which might appear in @xmath37 depending on the transformation properties of the fields .",
    "we will consider a term of the form w = - . [ wri ] alternatively , a term proportional to @xmath38 , for example , corrects the potential for @xmath35 if there is a term in the potential k = .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath39 depend on the discrete charge assignments of the fields .",
    "if @xmath39 is not too large , its effects are dramatic .",
    "such terms , again , lead to a supersymmetric minimum of the potential at large @xmath35 ( with @xmath40 ) , and again give rise , for positive @xmath41 , to a _ maximum _ of the potential for @xmath35 at field strength generically large compared to @xmath22 but small compared to @xmath12 .    proceeding as before , using the superpotential and corrections in eqns . ",
    ", we can compute the number of @xmath6-foldings and the slow roll parameters ( and hence @xmath8 ) .",
    "the potential for @xmath35 is now , approximately , [ potn ] v(i ) = ^4 ( 1 + ^2 16 ^2 ( i^i ) - ( -1))-^2 m_p^2 ( i m_p ) ^n + c.c ..    the fluctuation spectrum relates @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as before . for a given value of @xmath22 , the initial value of the field at @xmath42 @xmath6-foldings is fixed .",
    "so , then , is @xmath8 . to get a rough sense of scalings",
    ", we can suppose that @xmath35 starts very near the maximum of the potential , and that @xmath43 ( in order to achieve @xmath44 ) . because @xmath45 at the hilltop , we will simply use the formula for normal hybrid inflation in our estimate ; shortly we will check the accuracy of this numerically , and see that this leads to an order one error .",
    "then one finds that = ( ( .02 n)^n(6.4 10 ^ 9)^2-n ( n)^-2 ) ^1 4n -12 . for particular values of @xmath13 , we can compute @xmath22 and @xmath21 : taking @xmath46 and @xmath47 , this gives @xmath48 gev and @xmath49 .",
    "for @xmath50 , one obtains @xmath51 gev , and @xmath52 .",
    "the scale @xmath22 grows slowly with @xmath13 , reaching @xmath53 gev at @xmath54 and @xmath16 gev for @xmath55 . in general ,",
    "these results scale with @xmath41 as : ^-1 2(n-3).we discuss numerical studies of this problem in the next section .",
    "but the lesson here is that , for fixed values of @xmath41 , and for a given @xmath13 , the scale of inflation , @xmath22 , is fixed to a narrow range .",
    "denoting the real part of the field @xmath35 by @xmath56 , the potential in eqn . becomes [ potnsigma ] v ( ) = ^4 ( 1 + ^2 16 ^2 ( ^2 ) - ( -1))-^2 m_p^2 ( m_p ) ^n , where we have included in @xmath41 the numerical factor @xmath57 coming from the field redefinition .",

    "it is not possible to accomodate @xmath44 within the framework of small field inflation . even for this large value of the field ,",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio is predicted to be small : r=0.12 210 ^ -6",
    "the picture of small field inflation we have developed up to now assumes that the scale of inflation is large compared to the scale of supersymmetry breaking , i.e. that @xmath4 .",
    "this is the origin of the requirement that the superpotential should vanish and supersymmetry be unbroken , to a good approximation , at the end of inflation .",
    "but one might consider the possibility that @xmath83 . a higher scale of @xmath31 is suggested by the observed higgs mass and supersymmetry exclusions . in addition , for small values of @xmath13 , we have obtained small values of @xmath84 .",

    "one writes a theory of a single field , @xmath18 , and does not require an unbroken @xmath5 symmetry at the end of inflation .",
    "instead , one assumes that the negative contribution to the cosmological constant arising from the vev of the superpotential is cancelled by some supersymmetry breaking dynamics . to constrain the form of the superpotential ,",
    "one still assumes a discrete @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "it is necessary , as in hybrid inflation , to tune the potential so that the @xmath86 term is small .",

    "the resulting model is of the hilltop type .",
    "the potential exhibits a local maximum at the origin , and the initial value of the field must lie quite close to the maximum ( compared to the distance of the origin from the minimum ) . inflation occurs in a region very close to the origin in field space ( defined by an unbroken @xmath5 symmetry ) .",
    "the field then settles into a minimum with small cosmological constant and broken supersymmetry and @xmath5 symmetry .",
    "the model can produce the requisite number of @xmath6-foldings and fluctuation spectrum , without introducing an extremely small number analogous to @xmath21 of eqn . .",
    "however , it predicts too _ small _ a value of @xmath8 , n_s = 0.94 . to obtain a spectral index consistent with planck ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce a small and well - tuned constant in the superpotential , which the authors denote @xmath87 , and is of order @xmath88 ( in planck units ) .",
    "there are other issues , such as a possible gravitino problem and overproduction of dark matter , but these can readily be solved by introducing additional matter coupled to the inflaton",
