    "such trajectories , which are crumpled more severely than the ordinary brownian random walk , are characteristic of the so - called branched polymers . to illustrate the physical significance of this class of trajectories , we have developed a model of the deconfinement phase transition , which is based on a gluon chain extending along such a trajectory .",

    "the _ second_-order phase transition at @xmath233 is due to the insufficient entropy generated by the random walk in that case , _ even _ for a walk with hausdorff dimension 4 . as a result of this insufficiency ,",
    "the model from the thermodynamical viewpoint becomes equivalent to the conventional model of the deconfinement phase transition based on the condensation of long _ closed _",

    "the latter also belongs to the 2d - ising universality class ( for a discussion of this issue see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is intuitively clear that the condensation of quarks is associated with the zigzag character of their motion , leading to a decrease with the schwinger proper time of their effective string tension .",
    "it is also known that small wilson loops of heavy quarks respect the `` area - squared '' law , which reproduces the heavy - quark condensate . in this paper , using an ansatz for the wilson loop interpolating between the area law at large distances and the `` area - squared '' law at small distances , we have shown that the decrease of the effective string tension with the schwinger proper time occurs linearly .",
    "this leads to the lower bound  ( [ lb ] ) for the constituent quark mass in our model , whereas the naive use at all distances of the area law alone yields an unacceptably high value of this mass .",
    "the linear fall - off of the effective string tension with the proper time is associated with highly fractal trajectories of light quarks .",
