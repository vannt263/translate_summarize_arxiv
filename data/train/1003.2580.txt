    "the basaltic howardite , eucrite and diogenite meteorites ( heds ) and the large main belt asteroid 4 vesta have traditionally been linked due to their spectroscopic similarity and the lack of any other large asteroid with the characteristic spectral signature of magmatic basalts @xcite .",
    "the presence of a collisional family associated with vesta supports this link .",
    "vesta - family members , often referred to as the vestoids , are spectroscopically classified as v - types and are dynamically linked to vesta .",
    "the term non - vestoid refers to any v - type asteroid that originated on a parent body other than vesta .",
    "the vestoids extend from the @xmath4 secular resonance at the inner edge of the main belt to the 3:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter at 2.5 au ( fig .",
    "[ fig.inner ] , * ? ? ?",
    "these resonances act as a dynamical escape hatch from the main belt and can transport fragments removed from the surface of vesta ( or one of the vestoids ) to the earth as he d meteorites @xcite",
    ". resolved images of vesta reveal a large crater ( @xmath5 km in diameter ) on its south pole @xcite , supporting a scenario of collisional formation for the vesta family .",
    "hydrocode simulations of the collision that formed the vesta family suggest that km - size fragments would have been removed with ejection velocities ( @xmath6 ) of no greater than approximately 0.6 km / s .",
    "simplified versions of gauss s equations can be used to quantify the distance from vesta in orbital element space corresponding to this ejection velocity @xcite .. ] the maximum range of semi - major axes for collisionally - produced fragments can be estimated by assuming that a hypothetical vestoid was ejected with a 0.6 km / s velocity vector aligned exclusively in a direction tangential to its orbit ( equation 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "this calculated range is @xmath7 au , centered on the semi - major axis of vesta ( 2.36 au ) .",
    "similar calculations can be done for both eccentricity and inclination , producing ranges of @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "this region of orbital element space is enclosed by the ellipse in figure [ fig.inner ] .",
    "figure [ fig.inner ] shows numerous v - type asteroids in the inner main belt with values of @xmath6 much larger than 0.6 km / s , some with values in excess of 2 km / s .",
    "when these objects were first discovered it was unclear how they could have reached such orbits .",
    "however , recent progress in the use of numerical integrators has helped to clarify this issue .",
    "showed that three - body and weak secular resonances could lead to the migration of some vestoids to orbits with @xmath10 km / s .",
    "@xcite showed that a combination of these resonances and the yarkovsky effect could disperse the orbits of vestoids to nearly the full extent of the inner main belt .",
    "however , these authors found that the observed number of v - type asteroids at low inclination ( @xmath3 ) was too large to be explained by their model of vestoid migration .",
    "three possibilities exist to explain this over - abundance of low-@xmath11 v - types .",
    "first , these objects could be fragments of basaltic crust from a non - vestoid differentiated parent body . in this case",
    "these objects could be spectroscopically distinct from the vestoids , as is the case for non - vestoid v - types in the outer main belt ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , they may be from vesta , but were removed from the surface before the late heavy bombardment ( lhb ) , before the primary family forming collision , and were scattered to their current orbits as mean motion and secular resonances swept through the main belt during the lhb @xcite . in this case",
    "these objects would represent an older population of vestoids , removed from a different region on vesta s surface and thus might be spectroscopically distinct .",
    "third , these objects may have been ejected from the vesta parent body at the time of family formation and have since migrated to their current orbits by some unexplored dynamical mechanism . in this case",
    "these objects should not appear spectroscopically different from other v - type asteroids in the inner main belt .    a similar line of reasoning motivated @xcite to investigate the visible - wavelength spectral features ( namely the slope and 1 @xmath2 band depth ) of 20 v - type asteroids in the inner main belt as a function of their orbital elements .",
    "these authors found that v - type asteroids with large values of @xmath6 tended to have steeper spectral slopes than v - types with smaller @xmath6 .",
    "however , the largest value of @xmath6 considered by these authors was 0.65 km / s , very close to the expected ejection velocity of vestoid fragments .",
    "furthermore , all of the objects that were studied have since been incorporated into the vesta dynamical family as detection completeness has increased in the last decade .",
    "thus it is surprising that this spectroscopic trend was observed as a function of orbital parameters for objects that plausibly originated at the same time from the same parent body .",
    "@xcite attempted a similar investigation into the spectroscopic diversity of vestoids at nir wavelengths .",
    "this study produced unexpected results : the band ii to band i area ratios and the band i and band ii centers for the majority of the v - types in their sample did not agree with those of the heds ( band i and ii refer to the 1 and 2 @xmath2 absorption bands common to basaltic material , see  [ sec.tools ] for definitions of these parameters ) .",
    "although it has been suggested that band area ratios are sensitive to variations in grain size , temperature and space weathering @xcite , band centers should be less sensitive to these effects and thus comparable between genetically related populations ( i.e. the heds and vestoids ) .    in light of recent advances in dynamical simulations and improvements in nir spectroscopic instrumentation @xcite",
    ", we revisit the issue of the diversity of basaltic asteroids by measuring the nir spectral properties of 39 inner main belt v - type asteroids .",
    "the goals of this study are threefold : ( 1 ) address the reported spectro - dynamical correlation amongst v - type asteroids in the inner main belt @xcite by extending our analysis out to nir wavelengths and by including v - types across a wider range of orbital element space ; ( 2 ) address the findings of @xcite to look for spectroscopic differences between inner belt v - type asteroids and he d meteorites ; ( 3 ) determine if any of the v - type asteroids in the inner main belt have spectroscopic properties suggestive of a non - vestoid mineralogy .",
    "it is important to note that we do not attempt to extract detailed mineralogical information for individual asteroids .",
    "instead we characterize our relatively large data set using band analysis techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with the intent of making statistically significant statements about the gross spectral properties of v - type asteroids relative to those of the he d meteorites .",
    "the reflectance spectra of minerals contain absorption features that are diagnostic of properties such as composition , albedo , grain size and crystal structure .",
    "a variety of analytic tools have been developed to interpret such information from remotely obtained spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "band analysis techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are useful for characterizing spectral data and can be used as a starting point for deriving mineralogical information @xcite . as a characterization tool ,",
    "band analyses are completely objective , requiring no knowledge or assumptions about mineralogy , and can be implemented quickly for a large number of spectra .",
    "the primary goal of this work is to use band analysis techniques to facilitate a comparison between heds and v - type asteroids .",
    "we perform this band analysis with attention to the following parameters : the minima and central wavelength of the 1 and 2 @xmath2 olivine - pyroxene absorption features ( band i and ii respectively ) and the ratio of areas within these two bands .",
    "these key parameters are depicted in figure [ fig.bands ] .",
    "we also measure the band i slopes of the asteroids for comparison to results of @xcite .",
    "measurement of these parameters is dependent on several polynomial fits to actual data ( fig . [ fig.bands ] ) .",
    "these fits include a fourth order fit to the reflectance peak at @xmath12 , third order fits to the reflectance troughs and peak at @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and a second order fit to the red - edge of the @xmath15 band .",
    "the band minima are equal to the minima of the third order fits across each of the reflectance troughs ( @xmath16 for band i and @xmath17 for band ii ) .",
    "the band i center is measured by first fitting a line ( labelled band i slope in fig . [ fig.bands ] ) that intersects the fitted peak at @xmath12 and is tangent to the reflectance peak at @xmath18 .",
    "this continuum slope is then divided into the data and the minimum of this slope - removed band is defined as the band center .",
    "band i centers are typically at longer wavelengths than band i minima because of the positive band i slope for most heds and v - type asteroids .",
    "band ii centers are defined as equal to the band ii minima ( without dividing out a continuum slope ) , because the red edge of the @xmath15 band is typically unresolved in nir telescopic data ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig.bands ] ) .",
    "we define the red edge of the @xmath15 band to be at @xmath19 ( the reddest wavelength for which all of our data are reliable ) .",
    "band areas are calculated as the area between the band slopes and data points .",
    "the calculation of error bars for each of these band parameters is discussed in  [ sec.vtype_bands ] .",
    "we have intentionally been very explicit in our definition of these band parameters because other studies have employed different methodologies .",
    "for instance , @xcite define the red edge of band ii at 2.4 @xmath2 while @xcite define it at 2.5 @xmath2 . in some studies ,",
    "the band centers are defined as the wavelength at which the band areas are bisected ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although these differences are subtle , they do make it difficult to compare measurements from one study to another ( a similar discussion of this issue was also presented by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we apply our methodology to all of the data considered here so that comparisons can be made between the asteroids and meteorites .",
    "these measurements are internally consistent and are not meant to be directly compared to previous works .",
    "to build a comparison database for the asteroids we perform a spectral band analysis for each of the he d meteorites that are included in the brown relab spectral catalog @xcite .",
    "all samples that were analyzed are listed in the appendix .",
    "we safely ignore error bars in the measurement of the meteorite band parameters , because they are much smaller than those associated with the asteroidal data (  [ sec.vtype_bands ] ) , and they become irrelevant in our statistical approach to characterizing the overall spectral properties of the heds .",
    "the range of he d band parameters roughly agree ( within @xmath20 ) with those measured by previous investigators .",
    "this set of he d spectra excludes some of the data that are available in the relab database .",
    "we do not include samples that have been processed in laser irradiation experiments .",
    "when multiple spectra for a single sample exist , which is true for about 40% of the samples , we choose data corresponding to the smallest available grain size ( for relab this is @xmath21 ) .",
    "this approach is reasonable because the grains that compose the regoliths of vestoids are believed to be @xmath22 in size @xcite .",
    "we note that preferentially selecting these small - grained samples does not have a significant effect on any of our results . when relevant ( e.g.  [ sec.bars ] ) , we discuss the implications of this selection criterion .",
    "our aim in analyzing these meteoritic spectra is not to perform a detailed study of spectral changes as a function of particle size , irradiation level and other variables ; for such a study see .",
    "a plot of bi center versus bii center for the heds is shown in figure [ fig.b1b2_hed ] .",
    "the three he d subgroups are well defined ( although they do overlap ) in this parameter space .",
    "the regions occupied by each subgroup have been shaded or outlined so that they can be compared to the band parameters of the v - type asteroids in  [ sec.vtype_bands ] . in general , eucrites tend to have band centers at longer wavelengths than the diogenites , which implies that they are more fe - rich and have ca / mg abundance ratios much greater than 1 .",
    "this is confirmed by chemical analyses of eucrite samples @xcite .",
    "the diogenites have shorter wavelength band centers due to ca / mg abundance ratios much less than 1 and relatively fe - poor compositions .",
    "unsurprisingly , the howardites ( brecciated mixes of eucrites and diogenites ) have band centers that are intermediate to that of the eucrites and diogenites . the compositional trend represented by the band centers is consistent with the origin of the diogenites at greater depths within the he d parent body , i.e. low - ca diogenites crystallized and settled before high - ca eucrites as the he d parent body cooled .",
    "a plot of bar versus bii center is shown in figure [ fig.bar_hed ] .",
    "traditionally , bar is plotted versus bi center due to the mineralogical relevance of this particular combination of axes @xcite .",
    "however , we are not attempting to draw mineralogical inferences from our data .",
    "furthermore , we find that the bii centers of the three he d subgroups are better segregated with less overlap than the bi centers .",
    "thus , the axes in figure [ fig.bar_hed ] are the preferred method for presenting our data .",
    "the bars do not clearly segregate the three he d subgroups , however the diogenites do tend towards larger values .",
    "the lack of high - ca pyroxene amongst the diogenites is a likely cause for their higher bars @xcite . truncating the edge of bii at 2.44 @xmath2",
    "might also have affected their bars .    of the 75 heds that were analyzed , four eucrites ( passamonte , ibitira , nwa011 , and pca91007 ) have anomalous oxygen isotope ratios . specifically ,",
    "these meteorites all have [ @xmath23o/@xmath24o ] abundance ratios that are at least @xmath25 away from the mean [ @xmath23o/@xmath24o ] ratios for ordinary heds , which display a scatter of only @xmath26 relative to their mean @xcite .",
    "the interpretation for these four eucrites is that they derive from unique ( non - vestoid ) differentiated parent bodies .",
    "our analysis shows that the band paramters of these four samples are in no way different from the other eucrites ( figs .",
    "[ fig.b1b2_hed ] & [ fig.bar_hed ] ) . at face value",
    "this would seem to suggest that the spectroscopic properties ( and by extension the mineralogy ) of basaltic material from one parent body to the next is indistinguishable and that isotopic information is needed to distinguish individual parent bodies .",
    "however , this does not seem to be the case for all v - type asteroids in the main belt .",
    "for example , 1459 magnya is a non - vestoid v - type with distinct band parameters @xcite .",
    "thus , while band analysis techniques are capable of distinguishing v - type asteroids with no genetic relation to vesta , this does not seem to be the case amongst the heds .",
    "the reason for this remains unclear .",
    "we collected nir spectra of 39 v - type asteroids distributed throughout the inner main belt ( fig .",
    "[ fig.inner ] , appendix a , table [ tab.obs ] ) .",
    "all of these observations , with the exception of the data of vesta from 1981 , were obtained with the spex instrument @xcite at nasa s irtf .",
    "in addition to our new observations , these data include those from @xcite , data from the ongoing mit - uh - irtf joint campaign for neo spectral reconnaissance ( neosr , pi s richard binzel & alan tokunaga ) and the spectrum of 4 vesta from @xcite .",
    "see the specific references for details regarding observing conditions and reduction of these data sets .",
    "all new spex observations were made with the telescope operating in a standard abba nod pattern .",
    "spex was configured in its low resolution ( r=250 ) prism mode with a 0.8 \" slit for wavelength coverage from @xmath27 .",
    "all targets were observed at an air mass of less than 1.5 and as near as possible to their meridian crossings .",
    "the slit was orientated along the parallactic angle at the start of each observation to minimize the effects of atmospheric dispersion .",
    "exposure times were limited to 200 seconds .",
    "the number of exposures was selected in an attempt to obtain a consistent @xmath28 for all asteroids .",
    "internal flat fields and arc line spectra were obtained immediately after or before each target asteroid .",
    "a solar analog star was observed to calibrate each asteroid spectrum ( i.e. solar correction , compensating for instrument response and removal of atmospheric absorption features ) .",
    "analogs were observed closely in time , altitude and azimuth to the asteroid .",
    "the spectrum of each asteroid was calibrated using a single solar analog .",
    "specific analogs were selected as those which minimized residual atmospheric features in the calibrated spectrum of a given asteroid .",
    "calibration and reduction of our new observations employed the spextool package @xcite .    when available , visible wavelength data from @xcite , smass @xcite or s3os2 @xcite were appended to the nir spectra to increase wavelength coverage and to improve s / n at the blue edge of the 1 @xmath2 absorption band .",
    "the addition of visible wavelength information to the nir spectra does not significantly effect the trends in band parameters that are discussed in the following sections .",
    "figure [ fig.obs ] shows that both the 1 and 2 @xmath2 absorption bands are resolved for all 49 of the spectra and that the typical s / n is either better than or comparable to previous studies of nir band parameters of v - type asteroids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the targets 2653 principia , 2851 harbin , 3155 lee , 3782 celle and 4215 kamo were each observed at two different epochs by the neosr program ( table [ tab.obs ] ) .",
    "the data from these pairs of observations were combined into composite spectra to improve s / n and are presented as such in figure [ fig.obs ] .",
    "new observations of asteroids 2653 principia and 4215 kamo are also presented in figure [ fig.obs ] .",
    "the band analysis procedure described in ",
    "[ sec.tools ] was applied to each of the nir asteroidal spectra .",
    "the results of this band analysis are summarized in table [ tab.band_params ] . in order to compare these parameters to those of the heds , which were measured in a laboratory at @xmath29",
    "k , a temperature correction to the band centers was required .",
    "temperature corrections were computed following the methodology of .",
    "the mean surface temperature of an asteroid ( @xmath30 ) is approximated by the equation for energy conservation : @xmath31^{1/4 } , \\label{eqn.temp}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the albedo , @xmath33 is the solar luminosity ( @xmath34 w ) , @xmath35 is the thermal beaming parameter ( assumed to be unity ) , @xmath36 is the asteroid s infrared emissivity ( assumed to be 0.9 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath37 is the stefan - boltzman constant and @xmath38 is the asteroid s heliocentric distance .",
    "though the albedo of 4 vesta and 1459 magnya are approximately 0.4 @xcite , recent spitzer observations suggest that smaller v - type asteroids may have albedos as low as 0.2 @xcite .",
    "thus , the albedo of each target was assumed to be 0.3 .",
    "the calculated mean surface temperature for each of the v - type asteroids is given in table [ tab.band_params ] .",
    "uncertainties in the adopted parameters ( @xmath32 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) do not have a large affect on our resulting temperature corrections because of the small ( 1/4 ) exponent in equation [ eqn.temp ] .",
    "the temperature - dependent wavelength correction ( in microns ) to the bi and bii centers are given by : @xmath39 @xmath40 these equations are derived from linear fits to laboratory measured band centers for two different pyroxenes at temperatures of 293 , 173 and 80 k @xcite . in general these corrections",
    "are small : 0.002 @xmath2 for all of the @xmath41 values ( rounded to the resolution limit of the spectra ) and about an order of magnitude more for @xmath42 ( table [ tab.band_params ] ) .",
    "these shifts are much less than the range of measured band centers and thus do not have a major impact on our results , however they do improve the measured overlap of the heds and v - types ( see  [ sec.diagrams ] ) .",
    "the temperature corrected band centers are presented in table [ tab.band_params ] .",
    "the spectrum of asteroid 36412 ( 2000 op49 ) has the lowest wavelength - averaged signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n@xmath4327 ) in this data set .",
    "this object s spectrum was used to estimate maximum statistical error bars for the measured asteroidal band parameters .",
    "determining the error bars on band centers is non - trivial because the uncertainties for the observed data points are along the reflectance axis , not along the wavelength axis . to access the errors on the band centers of asteroid 2000",
    "op49 we ran a monte carlo simulation in which random noise ( at the level of the measured signal - to - noise ) was added to segments of the spectrum in the vicinity of the band i and band ii minima .",
    "these segments were re - fit with a third - order polynomial and the new band centers were calculated .",
    "this process was repeated 100,000 times and the standard deviation of the measured band centers was calculated .",
    "the result of this error analysis gives @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this procedure for estimating errors on band centers is similar to that of @xcite .",
    "most of the asteroidal spectra are of much higher s / n ( @xmath46 ) and thus will have statistical errors for their band centers that are insignificant relative to the general trends in which we are interested .",
    "the errors for bars are calculated by first measuring the largest and smallest possible band areas based on the s / n characteristics of a given spectrum .",
    "the maximum band areas are measured by subtracting noise at the 1-sigma level from each data point , while the minimum band areas are measured by adding noise at the 1-sigma level .",
    "for example , the bii area of 2000 op49 with 1-sigma worth of noise subtracted from the data points is 0.608 and the bii area with 1-sigma worth of noise added is 0.516 .",
    "we define the errors on the individual band areas to be one half of the difference between these maximum and minimum values .",
    "the net error on the bar then involves the propagation of the errors from each band .",
    "performing this analysis on the spectrum of 2000 op49 gives a maximum error bar on the asteroidal bars of @xmath47 .",
    "the asteroidal band centers are plotted in figure [ fig.b1b2_vtypes ] along with the howardite , eucrite and diogenite regions that were defined for figure [ fig.b1b2_hed ] .",
    "eight asteroids ( 4 vesta , 956 elisa , 1468 zomba , 2045 peking , 2579 spartacus , 2653 principia , 2763 jeans and 4215 kamo ) were observed more than once .",
    "these individual observations are connected by the thin lines .",
    "the maximum statistical error bars calculated from the spectrum of 2000 op49 (  [ sec.errorbars ] ) are indicated in this figure and are clearly much smaller than the size of the he d regions and the range of band centers displayed by the asteroids . the variability between multiple observations of individual asteroids is typically larger than the statistical errors and is likely due to a combination of compositional variation across the surface of the asteroids , differences in observing circumstances ( e.g. use of different solar analogs , different observational phase angles ) , and uncorrected systematic effects .",
    "vesta is known to display large variation in its band centers due to compositional variation on its surface @xcite .",
    "however , such variation may not apply to these targets , which are more than an order of magnitude smaller in size .",
    "observations of single asteroids through multiple rotation periods and with multiple instruments could determine whether any systematic effects may be inherent to these spex data .",
    "note that the mean of the band centers for the v - types do not seem to be affected by the ( apparently ) random variability introduced by multiple observations of individual objects .",
    "four of the asteroids [ 1468 zomba , 2823 van der laan , 3703 volkonskaya and 50098 ( 2000 ag98 ) ] were observed on single epochs as part of the neosr program and do not have complementary visible wavelength data .",
    "these data have been truncated at 0.82 @xmath2 as part of the standard neosr reduction protocol .",
    "thus their full 1 @xmath2 absorption feature is not resolved , thereby preventing a calculation of a bi slope and center .",
    "however , an upper limit to the bi center can be made based on the measured bi minima .",
    "the largest offset between a bi minimum and a bi center was measured to be 0.016 @xmath2 for asteroid 7800 zhongkeyuan .",
    "adding this value to the bi minima of the four neosr asteroids produces reasonable upper limits to their bi centers .",
    "these four objects are plotted in figure [ fig.b1b2_vtypes ] as upside - down , filled triangles .",
    "as previous authors have noted , there appears to be a lack of diogenetic v - type asteroids in the inner main belt .",
    "however , we do find four objects that plot near the howardite - diogenite boundary in figure [ fig.b1b2_vtypes ] : 2851 harbin , 3155 lee , 26886 ( 1994 tj2 ) and 27343 ( 2000 ct102 ) .",
    "these objects and the lack of diogentie - like asteroids are discussed in greater detail in the following section .",
    "our measured band centers do not span the full range of this parameter space as found by @xcite , instead our data suggests a good correlation between the band centers of the heds and v - type asteroids .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to the lower s / n of the @xcite dataset and/or differences in band analysis techniques .",
    "the dominant effect of the applied temperature corrections (  [ sec.tempcorr ] ) is a shift of the ensemble of asteroidal b2 centers by approximately + 0.02 @xmath2 .",
    "this shift , though small , improves the overlap between the v - type points and he d regions in figure [ fig.b1b2_vtypes ] .",
    "a plot of asteroidal bar versus bii center is shown in figure [ fig.bar_vtypes ] .",
    "only objects with fully resolved 1 and 2 @xmath2 bands can be plotted in this figure [ neosr targets 1468 zomba , 2823 van der laan , 3703 volkonskaya and 50098 ( 2000 ag98 ) are not included ] .",
    "the plotted v - type asteroids have band centers that are offset from those of the heds by an amount that is much greater than the maximum statistical error bar .",
    "this discrepancy has been noted before and was attributed to several possible causes , including grain size , temperature , weathering and mineralogical effects . in ",
    "[ sec.bars ] we present specific arguments for possible causes of this spectral mismatch .",
    "we begin this discussion by considering whether any of the inner belt v - type asteroids represent distinctly non - vestoid mineralogies .",
    "this is facilitated by first considering the spectroscopic properties of two non - vestoid v - type asteroids that orbit outside of the 3:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter : 1459 magnya and 21238 ( 1995 wv7 ) .",
    "these are the only two non - vestoid v - types with published nir spectra . from the all - night average spectrum of @xcite",
    "we compute the band parameters of magnya : bi center = 0.933 , bii center = 1.957 , and bar = 3.395 .",
    "these band centers are plotted in figure [ fig.b1b2_vtypes ] and are undistinguishable from the population of inner belt v - types that we have analyzed .",
    "however , the bar of magnya is much larger than any of the objects ( asteroid or meteorite ) that we have measured .",
    "this large bar is similar to the value obtained by @xcite .",
    "the second of the non - vestoid v - types is asteroid 21238 ( 1995 wv7 ) .",
    "unfortunately a full ( @xmath48 ) spectrum of this asteroid does not exist in published literature .",
    "the best available data ( @xmath49 ) for 21238 is from the neosr online database ( http://smass.mit.edu/minus.html ) . from this truncated spectrum",
    "only band minima can be measured : bi minimum = 0.906 , bii minimum = 1.889 .",
    "again , an upper limit to the bi center of 21238 can be calculated by assuming the maximum offset between its bi minimum and bi center ( 0.016 ) .",
    "this enables the inclusion of 21238 in figure [ fig.b1b2_vtypes ] , where it falls in the lower - left corner , somewhat isolated relative to the other v - type asteroids and the only object that directly overlaps the region occupied by the diogenites .",
    "the spectroscopic properties of these two non - vestoid v - types ( bar for 1459 magnya and inferred band centers for 21238 ) are offset from the asteroids included in our sample , thus giving credence to the dynamical arguments that these must be non - vestoid v - types . amongst our sample of inner belt v - types , asteroid 4038 kristina",
    "is significantly offset with a lower bi center compared to the general he d trend ( though its bii center and bar are in no way unusual ) .",
    "though this unusual bi center might imply a non - vestoid mineralogy , that would be surprising for kristina because it resides closer to vesta in orbital element space ( @xmath50 km / s ) than any other of our targets .",
    "for this reason we interpret its bi center as an indication of the mineralogical diversity inherent to members of the vesta family and/or variability intrinsic to the observational circumstances for 4038 kristina .    from a statistical standpoint , we find that the band centers of the heds and v - types are virtually indistinguishable : the mean b1 centers are 0.934 for both populations and the mean b2 centers are 1.976 and 1.987 respectively .",
    "figure [ fig.b1b2_vtypes ] confirms that the band centers of these populations are in close agreement .",
    "this is consistent with their origin on a single parent body .",
    "it is unclear why a group of asteroids are shifted towards band i centers that are slightly higher than those of the heds ( fig .",
    "[ fig.b1b2_vtypes ] ) . amongst the heds , high ca- and fe - abundances push band centers to longer wavelengths",
    ", however this should affect both band i and band ii .",
    "this shift could be explained if we have underestimated the temperature corrections to the band centers ( equations [ eqn.db1 ] and [ eqn.db2 ] ) .",
    "another possibility may stem from the absence of visible wavelength data for some of these asteroids .",
    "this could be affecting the band analysis and pushing some objects towards longer bi centers .",
    "a final possibility is that this shift is a result of actual mineralogical differences , with v - type asteroids representing a wider range of compositions than are observed amongst the heds .",
    "four objects [ 2851 harbin , 3155 lee , 26886 ( 1994 tj2 ) and 27343 ( 2000 ct102 ) ] have higher than average bars and are offset towards smaller band centers from the majority of the asteroids in figure [ fig.b1b2_vtypes ] .",
    "this apparent offset in band center is likely due to incomplete number statistics rather than the presence of non - vesta mineralogies .",
    "future observations of additional vestoids would likely fill in the band center gap between these four objects and the rest of the objects studied here .",
    "the lack of diogenite - like bodies in our sample of 39 asteroids is puzzling .",
    "this has been previously noted for v - types in the main belt and in the neo population .",
    "it is plausible that the four asteroids near the diogenite border in figure [ fig.b1b2_vtypes ] are primarily composed of diogenites with some eucritic material contaminating their surfaces . in general , the vestoids are probably rubble - pile aggregates of collisional debris .",
    "the removal of large fragments from diogenetic depths ( @xmath51s of km ) within the vesta parent body may not have occurred .",
    "thus , fragments of diogenite - like material on the surfaces of v - type asteroids may only be observable with high resolution surface maps and will remain undetected in the hemispherical averages provided by telescopic data . an argument that is consistent with a rubble pile model for the vestoids is that the distribution of cosmic ray exposure ages is similar for each sub - group of the he d meteorites @xcite .",
    "lastly , we note that the asteroid 2579 spartacus was found to have a smaller bar ( @xmath431.3 ) than the rest of our sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig.bar_vtypes ] ) .",
    "this has been noted before and is thought to be related to an anomalously high olivine content relative to other vestoids .",
    "this could be due to an origin from deep within the vesta parent body where olivine abundances were higher than in the eucritic crust , or it could be due to its origin on another parent body . if spartacus was removed from large depths within the vesta parent body then we would expect other diogenetic asteroids to also be present in the main belt , perhaps at sizes below our current observational limits .",
    "the band analysis of these inner belt v - types reveals a large offset in bar between the asteroids and the heds ( fig . [ fig.bar_vtypes ] ) .",
    "it is surprising that the difference in bars is so pronounced : the mean asteroidal bar is 2.28 while the mean meteoritic bar is 1.58 , a discrepancy much greater than the statistical errors associated with the telescopic data .",
    "the origin of this offset is unclear , however effects related to terrestrial weathering of the meteorites , differences between the asteroidal and laboratory environments ( e.g.  temperature , grain size , phase angle ) , instrumental systematics , the technique of band analysis , compositional differences , impacts and space weathering are potential causes . in the following we argue that composition and space weathering are the only plausible explanations for this offset , though some combination could play a role .    _",
    "weathering of meteorites .",
    "_ if terrestrial weathering of the meteorites caused them to have smaller bars , then removing found meteorites and only considering falls should reduce this offset . of the 75 meteorite samples that were analyzed ,",
    "21 of these were observed as falls ( table [ tab.ap1.heds ] ) .",
    "we find that removing found heds causes the regions in figure [ fig.bar_vtypes ] to shrink so that almost no overlap between the asteroids and the meteorites perists .",
    "therefore it seems unlikely that terrestrial weathering is responsible for the discrepancy in bar .",
    "_ temperature effects . _",
    "if the asteroid s low surface temperatures were the cause of their relatively large bars , then heliocentric distance and bar should be directly proportional .",
    "we plot these two quantities in figure [ fig.bar_helio ] .",
    "although this figure shows a significant amount of scatter ( which is likely due to observational issues and compositional effects ) , there is a weak inverse correlation between bar and heliocentric distance ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the best fit to this correlation is given by : @xmath52 and can be interpreted as the mean spectral response of v - type mineralogies to changes in temperature .",
    "a decrease in bar with temperature is supported by laboratory measurements of eucritic and diogenetic samples @xcite .",
    "these experiments show that the width of band ii decreases with temperature faster than the width of band i , thus causing bar to drop .",
    "therefore , the asteroidal data and these laboratory measurements suggest the opposite relationship than what would be expected if temperature were the cause of the offset between the asteroidal and meteoritic bars .",
    "the combination of equations [ eqn.temp ] and [ eqn.heliofit ] predicts a temperature - dependent bar trend that can be tested by future measurements of he d meteorites or remote observation of v - type asteroids ( particularly those made of vesta by the dawn spacecraft ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the increased thermal emission of the meteorites relative to the colder asteroids is a cause for the observed offset in bar .",
    "thermal emission from the meteorite samples causes an increase in their bii areas relative to those of the asteroids .",
    "this has the effect of producing larger bars . if this thermal emission were accounted for then the discrepancy between the meteoritic and asteroidal bars would increase .",
    "_ grain size effects . _ showed that the bars of eucrites and diogenites increased with grain size .",
    "the particle sizes that they investigated ranged from 25 - 500 @xmath2 .",
    "they found that large grains produced bars up to 1.9 for eucrites and a bar of 2.04 was measured for a single diogenite .",
    "neither of these values is high enough to reach the mean bar of the v - types .",
    "furthermore , the trend between bar and grain size for the heds increases quickly up 100 @xmath2 and then reaches saturation at larger grain sizes .",
    "if we ignore this saturation issue , then the large bars of v - type asteroids might be explained by regoliths with particles beyond the upper end of the size range considered by .",
    "however , this contradicts the expected small regolith grain sizes ( @xmath53 ) for v - type asteroids @xcite and the general result of polarization studies which suggest that asteroid surfaces have grains less than 300 @xmath2 in size @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the multi - km asteroids in our sample should have regoliths with grains smaller than that observed on the sub - km asteroid itokawa @xcite , which has particles down to at least 1 mm in size @xcite .",
    "we note that the bar offset persists if we consider only relab samples with particles greater than or equal to 1 mm in size . for these reasons",
    "we argue that grain size effects are not sufficient to explain the observed bar offset , however the presence of coarse regoliths on the surfaces of these asteroids could be a contributing factor .",
    "_ phase effects . _",
    "the asteroidal observations were performed at phase angles ( defined as the angular separation between the sun and observer as viewed from the target ) between 2@xmath54 and 30@xmath54 ( table [ tab.obs ] ) . as was the case for heliocentric distance ,",
    "the bars of the asteroids show significant scatter as a function of phase angle .",
    "however , our observations show a weak trend of increasing bar with phase angle ( @xmath55 ) : @xmath56 telescopic observations of near - earth v - type asteroids across a wide range of phase angles would be an important test for the validity of equation [ eqn.phasefit ] .",
    "furthermore , future studies similar to those performed by @xcite will be essential to accurately characterize the effects of observing geometry on reflectance spectra of meteorite samples .",
    "very small ( @xmath57 ) phase angles were not accessed by our telescopic observations , thus is is not clear whether the trend of equation [ eqn.phasefit ] remains linear or turns down for @xmath58 . if it turns down then asteroidal phase angles of less than @xmath59 could result in small bars similar to those of the heds . however , the effective phase angles (= angle of incidence + angle of emission ) for the relab measurements were typically between 15@xmath54 and 30@xmath54 .",
    "thus , if all else was equal , the bars of the asteroids and the meteorites would have been comparable due to the overlapping range of observed phase angles . for this reason it seems unlikely",
    "that phase effects could have resulted in the observed bar offset .    _ instrumental systematics . _",
    "the offset in bar could be due to an uncorrected systematic effect inherent to the spex instrument or the reduction process .",
    "however , this seems unlikely because the observations of 4 vesta from 1981 ( which were not performed with spex ) result in a bar ( 2.55 ) that is well outside of the range displayed by the meteorites and one that is similar to the value measured from the data of vesta obtained with spex .",
    "furthermore , reduction of spex data with different software packages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and nir observations of v - type asteroids with other instruments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also result in large bars .",
    "future high - s / n observations with different nir spectrographs will help to determine whether any systematics are affecting our results .",
    "_ band analysis technique . _ the definition of the red edge of band ii at 2.44 @xmath2 acts to artificially reduce that band s area .",
    "it is apparent that the 2 @xmath2 band for many of the asteroids extends past this cutoff ( fig .",
    "[ fig.obs ] ) and for some meteorites this band can extend out past 2.6 @xmath2",
    ". unfortunately the asteroidal data are sharply truncated at these longer wavelengths due to absorption by atmospheric water bands .",
    "two tests have been performed which suggest that the bar offset is not related to our somewhat arbitrary definition for the edge of the 2 @xmath2 band .",
    "first , we remeasured the bars for all of the heds with the edge of bii defined at 2.6 @xmath2 .",
    "this redefinition had the effect of shifting the median bar of the heds from 1.62 to 2.14 .",
    "although this reduced the discrepancy , the median bar of the asteroids ( equal to 2.26 ) with the cutoff at 2.44 @xmath2 was still larger than this redefined meteoritic bar .",
    "it is safe to assume that increasing the cutoff wavelength for the asteroids would also increase their bars and thus preserve the offset relative to the heds .",
    "the effect of moving the edge of bii was tested for those asteroids with measured signal at wavelengths beyond 2.44 @xmath2 .",
    "figure [ fig.cutoff ] shows how the median bars of the meteorites and the asteroids varies as a function of the bii cutoff .",
    "all of the asteroids were included when the cutoff was defined at 2.44 @xmath2 , 39 asteroids have data long - wards of 2.48 @xmath2 , 31 asteroids could be measured with a cutoff at 2.49 @xmath2 , and 17 asteroids were included with a cutoff of 2.5 @xmath2 .",
    "figure [ fig.cutoff ] clearly shows that the increase in bar associated with extending the edge of bii to longer wavelengths is similar for both the asteroids and the meteorites .",
    "this suggests that if the asteroid data could be extended to longer wavelengths , then the bar offset from the meteorites would persist .",
    "_ compositional effects .",
    "_ compositional variation can not be ruled out as a cause for the difference between the bars of the heds and the v - type asteroids .",

    "making detailed statements regarding the mineralogical cause of such a large bar offset between the heds and these v - types would require sophisticated spectral modeling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the vesta family is probably several billions of years old @xcite , thus its members have experienced significant collisional evolution over their lifetimes .",

    "the build - up of significant quantities of impact - generated material would affect reflectance spectra .",
    "we consider the results of two previous studies to investigate these effects , however further work should be done to better understand the spectroscopic implications of impacts on the surface of v - type asteroids",
    ".    included a spectrum of impact glass from the eucrite macibini in their analysis of he d meteorites .",
    "a band analysis of this spectrum reveals a bar of 1.77 . this bar is smaller than all but one of the v - type asteroids ( 2579 spartacus ) , thus suggesting that the addition of impact glass to unshocked he d material would not result in the large bars seen for asteroids .",
    "@xcite measured the effects of high pressure ( 597 kbar ) shock on the reflectance spectrum of enstatite pyroxene .",
    "we found the bar of their shocked and unshocked enstatite spectra equal to 2.09 and 2.36 respectively .",
    "thus , the bar of this sample decreased following shock .",

    "this is partly due to the commonly held view that vesta and the vestoids have fresh or pristine surfaces ; an assumption rooted in the spectroscopic similarity between v - type asteroids and the heds at visible wavelengths @xcite and the assumption of lunar - style weathering @xcite for asteroidal surfaces , irrespective of composition .",
    "in general , the majority of studies on the space weathering of asteroids have focused on establishing a link between the visible wavelength spectral properties of s - type asteroids and ordinary chondrite meteorites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "space weathering on these bodies is assumed to be analogous to that which occurs on the moon , i.e. the vaporization and redeposition of submicroscopic metallic iron by proton bombardment and/or micro - meteorite impact results in a depression of spectral absorption features and a reddening of spectral slope @xcite .",
    "two independent sets of experiments have been performed to investigate the space weathering of he d meteorites . performed ion irradiation experiments to simulate weathering by the bombardment of solar wind particles .",
    "these authors irradiated a particulate sample ( 10 - 100 @xmath2 grain size ) of the eucrite bereba at several different levels of ion fluence .",

    ", the band analysis does show that the bars of the irradiated samples are larger by about 25% relative to the unaltered bereba sample .",
    "qualitatively this shift is of the right magnitude and direction to potentially explain the bar offset between the heds and v - type asteroids .",
    "it is worth noting that the band centers of the unaltered bereba sample do not match those of the bereba sample or any other of the eucrites from relab ( table [ tab.ap1.heds ] ) .",
    "this is likely due to differences in the preparation of the samples : relab uses a horizontally mounted sample tray , whereas used a compacted , vertically mounted sample . nevertheless , their results are compelling and certainly merit further investigation .",
    "the second set of he d weathering experiments were performed by @xcite who used laser irradiation to simulate weathering by micro - meteorite impacts .",
    "although one eucrite ( millbillillie ) and one diogenite ( johnstown ) were originally included in this study , problems related to the intensity of the laser necessitated a second series of experiments in which only millbillillie was studied .",
    "we will only discuss the results of this second set of experiments .",
    "prior to irradiation millbillillie was ground to particle sizes of @xmath60 .",
    "it was found that irradiation produced spherical blobs of glassy material that were similar in composition to the original sample and were typically @xmath61 in diameter .",
    "these investigators divided their irradiation products into two categories ( fully and partially irradiated ) delineated by a cutoff in particle size at @xmath62 .",
    "the fully irradiated products ( @xmath61 in size ) contained @xmath63 of the glassy material produced by the laser irradiation , the partially irradiated material contained the remaining 5% .",

    "this has been noted before and could be due to its origin on another parent body , however it could also be a large fragment that originated from greater depths ( relative to the other targets ) within the vesta parent body .",
    "the lack of additional spectroscopic outliers amongst the v - type asteroids in the inner main belt implies that they are of a common origin .",
    "however , this does not preclude the possibility that inner belt v - types include basaltic crustal fragments from multiple differentiated parent bodies that are indistinguishable with band analysis techniques .",
    "we have reported that v - type asteroids with low inclinations ( @xmath3 ) in the inner main belt tend to have band centers shifted to longer wavelengths .",
    "this is compelling in light of the dynamical results of @xcite , however additional data should be obtained to confirm or refute the significance of this finding . in particular , a focused study on low - inclination v - type asteroids may provide further insight on whether these objects are spectroscopically distinct .",
    "this study has resulted in several predictions that can be tested by the dawn spacecraft when it enters into orbit around vesta in the summer of 2011 .",
    "first , we have parameterized the dependence between temperature and bar ( equations [ eqn.temp ] and [ eqn.heliofit ] ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations with vir - ms of regions at various temperatures on vesta s surface can be used check this dependence .",
    "we have also suggested that fresher , less weathered surfaces on vesta ( e.g. impact craters ) should have smaller bars than the surrounding terrain . and finally , if the low inclination v - type asteroids in our study are predominantly eucritic in composition and were removed from one of the minor impact craters in vesta s northern hemisphere @xcite , then we expect that these craters will be devoid of significant quantities of diogenite - like material .",
    "in this appendix we present the spectra of all v - type asteroids analyzed in this study .",
    "numerical designations are shown in each panel .",
    "some targets were observed on multiple occasions : the dates of these observations are indicated in a year , month , day format ( yymmdd ) following the object designation .",
    "observations prior to the year 2006 were either published in @xcite , obtained as part of the ongoing mit - uh - irtf joint campaign for neo spectral reconnaissance ( neosr ) , or for the spectrum of 4 vesta from 1981 , obtained by @xcite .",
    "when available , visible wavelength data from one of several sources @xcite have been appended to the nir data .",
    "multiple neosr observations of 2653 principia , 2851 harbin , 3155 lee , 3782 celle and 4215 kamo were combined into composite spectra .",
    "all spectra have been normalized to unity at 1 @xmath2 and are all presented at the same scale .",
    "( figure [ fig.obs ] should go here )",
    "this appendix contains a table of the measured he d band parameters .",
    "the columns in this table are : name of the sample , meteorite type , mean particle size of the sample when the spectra were measured , bi and bii centers , and the ratio of bii area to bi area ( bar ) .",
    "the samples are listed alphabetically within each of the he d subgroups .",
