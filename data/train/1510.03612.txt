    "microscopic analysis of nuclear collective dynamics has been of significant interest for many years .",
    "recently , thanks to great theoretical and computational advances , the time - dependent density - functional calculations of nuclear collision dynamics for heavy systems become feasible . in this article , we use the terminology `` time - dependent density functional theory '' ( tddft ) instead of `` time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) theory '' .",
    "we present a recent result of the real - time calculation for the heavy systems , which suggests the fusion hindrance phenomena .",
    "the fusion hindrance is often interpreted by the `` extra - push '' energy which is required by a strong dissipative dynamics inside the coulomb barrier @xcite . in order to understand its complicated many - body dynamics , it is useful to derive the internuclear potential , the inertial mass parameter , and the energy dissipation from the microscopic dynamics . for this purpose ,",
    "the density - constrained tddft calculations , which was proposed earlier @xcite , have been extensively performed recently @xcite .",
    "another method based on the classical equation of motion was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . using the latter method",
    ", we discuss a possible microscopic mechanism of the fusion hindrance in sec .",
    "[ sec : fusion_hindrance ] .    among those transport coefficients",
    ", we put more focus on the derivation of the mass parameter in this article .",
    "the inertial mass of nuclear collective motion has been a long - standing problem in the nuclear structure physics @xcite .",
    "apparently , it is also very important for nuclear reaction dynamics .",
    "especially , after two nuclei touch , the derivation of the mass is a highly non - trivial matter .",
    "this requires extraction of the proper collective coordinates and its conjugate momenta .",
    "the adiabatic self - consistent collective coordinate ( ascc ) method @xcite is capable of determining these canonical variables by solving the self - consistent equations .",
    "then , the potential and the mass parameter can be uniquely determined in the unambiguous manner .",
    "we show out recent result for the spontaneous fission of @xmath0be , though they are somewhat preliminary yet .",
    "to calculate the inertial mass and the potential for the fusion reaction , we resort herewith to two different methods : dissipative - dynamics tddft and ascc method .",
    "this is based on the real - time tddft calculation and a mapping to the classical equation of motion .",
    "first , we separate the whole space into that of the `` left '' and `` right '' ( projectile and target ) .",
    "the center of mass of the left ( right ) @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and the momentum of the left ( right ) nucleus @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is computed from the tddft dynamics .",
    "then , the left ( right ) mass @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is estimated by @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "details of the method can be found in ref .",
    "the important point is that complex evolution of tddft dynamics is mapped to a one - dimensional classical equation of motion : @xmath10 where the relative distance @xmath11 and the relative momentum @xmath12 are obtained from @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "then , the reduced mass @xmath13 , nucleus - nucleus potential @xmath14 and friction coefficient @xmath15 , can be obtained at each @xmath11 .    in this method",
    ", we may determine three kinds of transport coefficients , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "this is an advantageous feature of the method .",
    "however , the definition of the  left and `` right '' becomes somewhat ambiguous after the two nuclei touch .",
    "furthermore , the assumption that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are canonical conjugate to each other becomes questionable .",
    "thus , it is desirable to compare the results with other calculations .",
    "this method is based on the existence of a pair of canonical variables @xmath16 suitable for the description of the fusion reaction .",
    "it leads to the basic equations of the self - consistent collective coordinate method @xcite which guarantee the maximal decoupling of the collision motion described by @xmath16 from the other intrinsic degrees of freedom . expanding those basic equations with respect to @xmath17 up to the second order",
    ", we obtain the equations of the adiabatic self - consistent collective coordinate ( ascc ) method @xcite . neglecting the curvature terms",
    ", it reduces to the following : @xmath18 and @xmath19- \\frac{\\partial^{2 } v}{\\partial q^{2 } } \\hat{q}(q )   |\\psi(q)\\rangle = 0 , \\label{rpa0 } \\\\ & & \\delta\\langle \\psi(q)|[\\hat{h},i\\hat{q}(q ) ] - \\frac{1}{m(q)}\\hat{p}(q )    |\\psi(q)\\rangle = 0 , \\label{rpa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the potential @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 @xmath22 is the total hamiltonian , @xmath23 the mass parameter of collective motion . @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to local generators of the variables @xmath17 and @xmath26 , respectively , at @xmath27 .",
    "the relatively simple form of eqs .",
    "( [ rpa0 ] ) and ( [ rpa ] ) is due to the adopted approximation to neglect the curvature terms .",
    "the original form of the ascc equations is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "( [ chf ] ) is similar to a constrained hartree - fock problem , however , the constraint operator @xmath28 depends on the coordinate @xmath26 and self - consistently determined with the rpa - like equations ( [ rpa0 ] ) and ( [ rpa ] ) .",
    "the mass @xmath29 corresponds to the thouless - valatin mass parameters at the hartree - fock energy minimum , which is known to reproduce the correct total mass for the translational motion @xcite .",
    "therefore , all the quantities are determined self - consistently and there is no _ a priori _ assumption of any kind .    after calculating the potential @xmath30 and the mass @xmath29",
    ", we may transform the coordinate @xmath26 to the variable @xmath11 ( distance between two nuclei ) . for the symmetric central collision",
    ", we can do this using the following operator : @xmath31,\\label{rdef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the collision axis is the @xmath32 axis . in order to transform the mass @xmath33 , we need the derivative , @xmath34 , which is obtained from the generator @xmath35 in eq .",

    "thus , the inertial mass @xmath38 with the coordinate @xmath11 describes the identical dynamics as @xmath29 does with the coordinate @xmath26 .",
    "note that this property is not guaranteed if we assume the collective coordinate @xmath11 in the beginning to define the mass @xmath38 .",
    "the synthesis of superheavy elements by heavy - ion fusion reactions is a challenging task because of its extremely low probability . in such fusion reactions with heavy nuclei ,",
    "whose charge product @xmath39 is larger than @xmath40 , it has been observed that the formation of a compound nucleus is strongly hindered at energies around the coulomb barrier compared with @xmath41 systems @xcite .",
    "the most probable reason behind this fusion hindrance is the occurrence of the quasi - fission , which involves re - separation without the formation of a compound nucleus after colliding nuclei touch each other . a macroscopic fluctuation ",
    "dissipation model using a langevin equation has been developed @xcite to analyze the competition between the quasi - fission and compound nucleus formation , especially in the synthesis of superheavy elements .",

    "it is interesting to observe that , despite of this strong energy dependence of @xmath13 , the calculated potential @xmath14 is rather universal .",
