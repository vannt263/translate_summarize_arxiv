    ", two pioneers in the quantitative study of the interstellar medium .    discovered nearly half a century ago , alignment of interstellar dust ( see hiltner 1949 , hall 1949 ) has not yet been understood properly .",
    "table  [ table1 ] outlines some features of the major known mechanisms of grain alignment , which are discussed below . to find out when a particular mechanism is efficient is a challenging and exciting problem to be solved jointly by observers and theorists ( see hildebrand & dragovan 1995 ; desch & roberge 1996 ) . at present , the lack of a proper understanding of the alignment processes means that it is extremely difficult to disentangle variations in polarization efficiency from magnetic field variations in polarization maps .",
    "the present research was initiated by recent studies of polarization of near - infrared background starlight seen through dark clouds , namely b216 - 217 in taurus ( goodman et al . 1992 ) and l1755 in ophiuchus ( goodman et al .",
    "1995 ) . in both cases",
    "it was shown , that the near infrared polarimetry of background starlight could not reveal magnetic field structure within these cold dense regions .",
    "in general , it seems that towards dark clouds polarization does increase with extinction for visual extinction @xmath2 but does not for @xmath3 ( goodman 1996 ) .",
    "a list of factors , that can suppress polarization from cloud interiors was presented in goodman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . here",
    "we analyze only one of those factors , namely , the difference in grain alignment .",
    "in other words , in our model we assume that grain shape , size and composition as well as magnetic field structure are the same in the exterior and interior of molecular clouds .",
    "it is shown in goodman ( 1996 ) , that other factors in the aforementioned list can further decrease the efficiency of dichroism for dense cloud interiors as compared to diffuse media .    in the present paper",
    "we attempt to explain the causes of a high polarization to extinction ratio for regions with low extinction ( @xmath1 ) as opposed to the low ratio of these parameters for quiescent clouds with high extinction ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "furthermore , we briefly address the challenging problem of why thermal emission polarization ( see hildebrandt 1996 ) observed at far - ir and submillimeter wavelengths from regions of massive star formation seems to override this tendency .",
    "we address the problem of polarization arising from low extinction and high extinction regions using quantitative models of grain alignment developed recently ( draine & weingartner 1996 a , b ; lazarian 1995 a , b , c , d ; lazarian & draine 1997a , lazarian & roberge 1997a , b , roberge , hanany & messinger 1995 ) . in particular , we apply these theoretical results to the filamentary dark cloud l1755 in ophiuchus .    in what follows",
    "we first provide the data about l1755 that we select as a representative dark filamentary cloud ( sect .",
    "2 ) , analyze the dynamics of dust grains ( sect .  3 ) and then calculate the measures of grain alignment in l1755 predicted by different mechanisms ( sect .  4 ) .",
    "the implications of our results for other dense clouds is given in sect .",
    "we select this cloud for detailed study because of the abundance of information about it available in the literature ( see table  2 ) .",
    "the extensive studies of @xmath5co in loren ( 1989 ) provide us with the density and velocity information , the zeeman studies in goodman & heiles ( 1994 ) provide us with estimates of magnetic field intensity , and optical and near - infrared polarization data are available in goodman et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and in goodman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , respectively .",
    "an additional advantage is that the extinction of l1755 changes from @xmath6 at the edge to @xmath7 at the center , which enables us to study the substantial variations of polarization with extinction within the same cloud .",
    "the concentration of atomic hydrogen is taken from the models of van dishoeck et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and bergin , langer & goldsmith ( 1995 ) .",
    "fractional ionization is estimated using the results of myers & khersonsky ( 1995 ) .",
    "the physical parameters in the outermost layers of l1755 are similar to the neutral diffuse ism and they match the parameters of the dark clouds as density increases ( see table  [ table2 ] ) . in what follows we will call the part of l1755 within the cylindrical radius @xmath8  pc the `` inner region '' , the next shell up to @xmath9 pc the `` intermediate region '' , and the regions up to @xmath10 pc the `` outer region '' .",
    "such a division involves a degree of arbitrariness , but it suits the purpose of obtaining crude estimates . the sketch of our model of l1755 is presented in fig .",

    ", the gas density is high ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ; see benson & myers 1989 ) and the magnetic field intensity is @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "this estimate of field strength corresponds to the requirement that it lies between values measured in nearby regions by hi zeeman observations ( goodman & heiles 1994 ) and the estimates of the field obtained through equipartition arguments ( myers & khersonsky 1995 ) . for the outer region of the cloud ,",
    "we assume that the field strength decreases to match the mean interstellar value @xmath15 @xmath14 ( myers 1987 ) .    the simultaneous change of field strength and gaseous density influences the velocity with which disturbances can propagate in these magnetized regions",
    ". assuming , that the line broadening is caused by alfvnic turbulence ( arons & max 1975 ) , we can expect , that the line width should decrease towards the higher density regions of l1755 , and this decrease is , in fact , observed .",
    "the ionization ratio should increase outward due to cosmic ray ionization as the density decreases and photo - ionization increases as the extinction decreases ( myers & khersonsky 1995 ) .",
    "before addressing the problem of alignment we should discuss the processes that determine grain rotation , since the nature of the rotation is an important factor in the alignment .",

    "molecules are being ejected with high velocities , and as a result the sites act as tiny rocket engines attached to a grain .",
    "these `` purcell rockets '' distributed over the grain surface with a mean distance @xmath21 between them can accelerate interstellar grains up to the high angular velocity @xmath22 ( see table  3 )    we assume ( see lazarian 1995c , roberge , hanany & messinger 1995 ) that in dark clouds the ratio @xmath23 .",

    "a comprehensive study of the effect of these radiative torques has started only recently ( draine & weingartner 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "this study has revealed that under some conditions radiative torques can be stronger than `` purcell rocket '' torques .",
    "although a full theory of the process has not yet been completed the encouraging results so far can be treated as preliminary evidence that grains of irregular shape achieve substantial suprathermal rotation due to radiative torques . in table",
    "[ table3 ] we reproduce data from numerical runs in draine & weingartner ( 1996 ) to show that the effects of the radiative torques are substantial both in outer regions of l1755 and in regions of massive star formation . whether purcell torques or radiative torques dominate in the outer regions of l1755 is not evident from these data .",
    "`` davis - greenstein alignment '' is the paramagnetic alignment of thermally rotating grains ( see table 1 ) . a grain whose angular velocity has non - zero component @xmath24 perpendicular to the direction of the interstellar magnetic field @xmath25 experiences alternating magnetization .",
    "this causes dissipation and a corresponding decrease in @xmath24 .",
    "if the time scale for paramagnetic dissipation , @xmath26 , is much less than the time - scale over which gaseous bombardment restores @xmath24 ( the latter coincides with the gas damping time , @xmath27 ) , grains should be well - aligned in the diffuse ism .",
    "we stress that this condition may not be satisfied in dense clouds , as the efficiency of paramagnetic relaxation also depends on the gas - grain temperature ratio ( jones & spitzer 1967 ) and this ratio is close to unity for dense gas ( see table 2 ) .",
    "davis - greenstein alignment also depends on the magnetic properties of interstellar grains ( see review by draine ( 1996 ) ) , so we need to distinguish the alignment of ordinary paramagnetic grains and the alignment of superparamagnetic and superferromagnetic grains . for the sake of simplicity , in what follows we will refer to both casses of `` super''-grains as `` spm grains '' .",
    "theoretical studies of davis - greenstein alignment show that this mechanism predictes less interstellar polarization than observed if grains have properties of ordinary paramagnetic materials ( see mathis 1986 , martin 1995 ) .",
    "therefore in our study of davis - greenstein relaxation we assume , that interstellar grains are spm ( see experimental evidence in goodman & whittet 1995 ) .",
    "spm grains align on a time - scale very small in comparison to the gaseous damping time ( the ratio of the two can be as small as @xmath28 ) . as a result ,",
    "randomization through gas - grain collisions becomes negligible on the time scale of grain alignment and the measure of alignment becomes limited only by the gas - grain temperature ratio .",
    "according to table  2 @xmath29 is greater than unity for all of three regions of l1755 .",
    "for these circumstances , fig .  2 presents a plot of the rayleigh reduction factor ( greenberg 1968 ) for thermally spinning spm grains @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the angle between the axis of symmetry of an oblate spheroid and the ambient magnetic field , while here and further on angular brackets @xmath32 denote ensemble averaging .",
    "this plot accounts for both incomplete coupling of @xmath33 with the grain principal axis of maximal inertia ( henceforth the axis of major inertia ) and the partial alignment of @xmath33 with respect to the external magnetic field ( see lazarian 1996c ) .",
    "we adopt this @xmath34 as our measure of alignment .    in general",
    ", @xmath34 ranges from @xmath35 corresponding to perfect alignment with grains longest axis parallel to the magnetic field direction to @xmath36 corresponding to perfect alignment with longer grain axis perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "@xmath37 corresponds to `` no alignment '' .",
    "negative values of @xmath34 in table 4 and in fig .",
    "2 indicate that grains tend to align with their long axes parallel to the external magnetic field and this is a consequence of the fact that @xmath38 ( jones & spitzer 1967 ) .",
    "we will call the alignment with negative @xmath34 `` wrong alignment '' to distinguish it from the `` right alignment '' with @xmath39 that dominates at least in the diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the very small absolute values of @xmath34 listed in table 4 under  paramagnetic alignment \" for every case involving thermal grain rotation show that davis - greenstein alignment of even spm grains is virtually ineffective throughout l1755 .    in specific cases we can relate @xmath34 to observed polarization . for instance",
    ", the intensity of the polarized component of starlight passing through a cloud is proportional to the difference in the maximal and minimal extinction cross - sections for an ensemble of aligned non - spherical grains .",
    "if the extinction cross - section for radiation with electric vector , @xmath40 , parallel to the symmetry axis of an oblate grain is @xmath41 and the cross - section for @xmath40 perpendicular to this axis is @xmath42 , then the polarized radiation intensity is proportional to @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the angle that the magnetic field makes with the direction of observation ( see roberge 1996 ) .",
    "the difference @xmath45 depends on the optical properties , oblateness , and sizes of grains ( see draine & lee 1984 ) . even for perfect alignment of highly polarising grains polarization arising from dichroic extinction",
    "does not exceed a few percent . to account for the observed polarization @xmath46 , @xmath47 is usually required ( see whittet 1992 ) .",
    "no appreciable davis - greenstein alignment is expected anywhere in l1755 where gas and dust temperatures are nearly equal .",
    "this conclusion is _ a fortiori _ true if grains are not superparamagnetic .",
    "( see table 4 . )",
    "purcell alignment is the paramagnetic alignment of grains rotating suprathermally .",
    "such grains are not susceptible to disorientation arising from gaseous bombardment . as a result ,",
    "purcell alignment does not depend on the gas - grain temperature ratio and ( 2 ) even if they are not superparamagnetic grains can be efficiently aligned in the typical interstellar magnetic field ( lazarian & draine 1997 , draine & lazarian 1997 ) ( see table  1 ) .    as shown above ,",
    "the inefficiency of davis - greenstein alignment of spm grains in l1755 stems from the insignificant difference in grain - gas temperatures .",
    "however , it was pointed out in sec .",
    "3 that grain rotation can be substantially faster than the gas kinetic temperature , and that `` purcell rockets '' may be a major cause of suprathermal rotation . for these rockets to work , a supply of `` fuel '' is required .",
    "this fuel is atomic hydrogen in the ambient gas . as the concentration of atomic hydrogen decreases towards the inner regions of l1755 grain rotation slows down ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "however , in the outer regions of l1755 the concentration of atomic hydrogen approaches that of diffuse regions and the rotation is suprathermal ( see table  3 ) .",
    "therefore , according to the results of spitzer & mcglynn ( 1979 ; see also table 4 ) , those grains which are spm should be perfectly aligned in the outer regions of l1755 .",
    "a different question is the alignment of suprathermally rotating grains of ordinary paramagnetic substance . until recently",
    ", it was believed that an appreciable purcell alignment can only be achieved under a rather restrictive condition of the long - lived spin - up ( spitzer & mcglynn 1979 , lazarian 1995b ) .",
    "however a study by lazarian & draine ( 1997a ) has revealed that a substantial alignment is attainable even for short - lived spin - ups .",
    "this alignment arises from a high degree of correlation between grain angular momentum @xmath33 before and after a crossover .",
    "this correlation was missed by earlier research which assumed that during spin - ups @xmath33 is perfectly aligned with the grain axis of major inertia ( see spitzer & mcglynn 1979 ) .",
    "recent study of this internal alignment ( lazarian & roberge 1997a ) has shown that coupling of @xmath33 with the major inertia axis is valid up to thermal fluctuations within the grain material . these fluctuations , contrary to intuitive expectations , enhance the alignment .",
    "our estimates that account for thermal fluctuations ( see table  4 ) indicate that the purcell mechanism can provide notable alignment of ordinary paramagnetic grains ( i.e. @xmath48 ) in the outer region of l1755 ( see table  4 ) .    for intermediate regions in fig .",
    "1 where @xmath49 , the effective grain rotational temperature will be at most twice that of the ambient gas .",
    "such rotation is only marginally suprathermal and disorientation during spin - ups is substantial . even under the most favorable conditions @xmath34 is still @xmath50 in the intermediate region .",
    "the purcell alignment is negligible for the inner region of l1755 ( see table  4 ) .      as pointed out in section 2 ,",
    "radiative torques are different from those arising from h@xmath20 formation . unlike the isotropic bath of h atoms that provide the `` fuel '' for purcell s spin - up , the photons needed to drive radiative alignment",
    "are often anisotropically distributed in space .",
    "this anisotropy results in a peculiar mechanism of grain alignment ( see mechanism 5 in table 1 ) , which tends to align the short axis of the grain with the magnetic field ( i.e.right alignment \" ) .",
    "the matter of radiative torques is currently an issue of an intense theoretical research ( draine & lazarian 1997 ) , and a number of questions need to be answered before quantitative conclusions are to be drawn .",
    "therefore some degree of uncertainty is present in our discussion here .",
    "our conclusions here are based on the results in draine & weingartner ( 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "a study in draine & lazarian ( 1997 ) has shown that for generally accepted values of active sites density and h@xmath20 formation efficiency radiative torques only marginally alter the dynamics which is dominated by h@xmath20 torques . however ,",
    "in view of huge uncertainties involved , it is also possible that the alignment by radiative torques may be the dominant mechanism of alignment .",
    "we hope that future theoretical work in the field will provide us with detailed predictions that can be used for testing the theory against observations .",
    "table  4 shows that for both the intermediate and inner regions of l1755 the radiative torques are too weak to produce any measurable grain alignment . at the same time",
    ", these torques can be important in the outer regions of l1755 .",
    "both thermally and suprathermally rotating grains , can be aligned due to collisions with a gaseous flow .",
    "the mechanical alignment of thermally rotating grains was described by gold ( 1951 ) , while the mechanical alignment of _ suprathermally _ rotating grains was described only recently ( lazarian 1995a ; see table 1 ) .",
    "the important factor in mechanical alignment is supersonic gas - grain drift .",
    "it was pointed out by lazarian ( 1994 ) that alfvn waves can cause such drift and this entails alignment with grain long axes perpendicular to magnetic field lines . i.e. the `` right alignment ''",
    ". the formal theory of grain drift is given in lazarian & draine ( 1997b ) and alignment measures are calculated in lazarian ( 1994 , 1995a , 1997a ) , lazarian & efroimsky ( 1996 ) , and lazarian , efroimsky & ozik ( 1996 ) .    a spectrum of alfvnic waves should be present in the interstellar medium , and alfvnic velocities are greater than sound velocities for most interstellar conditions ( myers 1987 ) . in these circumstances ,",
    "a crucial test of whether alfvnic waves cause supersonic drift is to compare the larmor frequency of grain gyration about magnetic field lines with the cut - off frequency of alfvnic spectrum ( lazarian 1994 , lazarian & draine 1997b ) .",
    "this comparison is difficult because the measured quantities needed to estimate the larmor frequency are uncertain .",
    "if grains are collisionally charged , then in regions with sufficent ionisation , alfvn waves can cause supersonic grain drift when the grain larmor frequency is lower than the cut - off frequency for the waves , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ionization ratio .    for the outer region of l1755",
    ", @xmath53 is of the order of @xmath54  s@xmath55 , and the grains there may experience supersonic drift . for grains in the intermediate and inner regions ,",
    "@xmath56 becomes @xmath57  s@xmath55 and 3@xmath58  s@xmath55 , respectively .",
    "therefore supersonic drift is only marginally possible for the intermediate region and impossible for inner regions of l1755 . in table",
    "4 we provide an estimate for grain alignment in the intermediate region , assuming a collisional charging of the grains .",
    "one source of uncertainty in these predictions is a possible helicity of grains ( lazarian 1995b ) .",
    "unfortunately a quantitative theory of such an alignment is still to be developed .",
    "if grains are more highly charged through photoemission ( draine 1978 ) in any region , then the larmor frequency is much greater than @xmath53 and supersonic motion is impossible .",
    "this can suppresses the alignment by alfven waves .    in the presence of supersonic ambipolar diffusion ,",
    "both thermally and suprathermally rotating grains can be aligned mechanically ( see table 4 ) .",
    "however , we do not have evidence for supersonic ambipolar diffusion in l1755 .",
    "therefore we do not discuss this possibility here .",
    "one mechanism omitted from table  1 can still be efficient in the interior regions of l1755 .",
    "this mechanism , suggested by spitzer and tukey ( 1951 ) , is based on the alignment of magnetic moments of ferromagnetic grains and has been shown to be very inefficient in the diffuse clouds ( davis & greenstein 1951 ) .",
    "however , its efficiency scales as @xmath59 , and therefore if grains are ferromagnetic , it may be active in dark clouds , where the ambient magnetic field @xmath60 is higher than in diffuse clouds , while the temperature is lower ( see table  2 ) . for a population of exclusively ferromagnetic grains , the measure of alignment",
    "is expected to be of the order of few per cent ( see lazarian 1995c ) , but if the abundance of such grains is negligible this mechanism is of marginal importance for l1755 .",
    "this mechanism will produce `` wrong alignment '' with the long grain axis parallel to @xmath25 .",
    "it has been suggested that since shocks can dissociate h@xmath20 , purcell alignment might be enhanced in shocked regions of cloud interiors ( johnson 1982 ) .",
    "shocks also cause ambipolar diffusion which may produce alignment ( roberge & hanany 1991 , lazarian 1994 , roberge et al .",
    "the presence of intense sources of cosmic rays or x - rays in the vicinity of a cloud may induce grain alignment .",
    "such radiation can excite grain rotation , enabling davis - greenstein alignment of spm grains ( lazarian & roberge 1997b ) and/or provide conditions for alignment by alfvnic waves ( lazarian 1994 , 1995 , lazarian & draine 1997b ) . as none of these special conditions are especially applicable to l1755 , we conclude that _ all _ the known major mechanisms fail in the cloud interior .",
    "we have seen above that all the major mechanisms ( see table  1 ) fail to produce grain alignment in the interior and intermediate regions of l1755 . on the other hand ,",
    "grain alignment in the outer regions of l1755 is efficient .",
    "if , for example , both ( 1 ) the purcell mechanism , providing alignment with measure @xmath61 , and and ( 2 ) mechanical alignment by alfvnic waves , providing the alignment with the measure @xmath62 , act simultaneously the overall alignment measure can be calculated using the approach suggested in lazarian ( 1996 ) . for suprathermally rotating grains",
    "the formula for the rayleigh reduction factor is @xmath63 and this provides @xmath64 for the outer region of l1755 in our example . as we pointed out above , the suprathermal rotation of grains arises in outer parts of l1755 as the result of h@xmath20 formation on grain surfaces .",
    "the measure of grain alignment versus grain size should be different for radiative torques and superparamagnetic relaxation .",
    "this provides a way to distinguish the mechanisms .",
    "another method of separating the mechanisms is to study how alignment varies with environmental conditions .",
    "for instance , paramagnetic alignment depends specifically on the concentration of atomic hydrogen , while the alignment caused by radiative torques varies only with extinction .",
    "table  3 indicates that at some optical depth purcell alignment continues , while the alignment by radiative torques may fail .",

    "the near infrared background starlight polarimetry indicates that grains are not aligned for @xmath4 , but the far - infrared emission polarimetry reveals aligned grains within clouds of high opacity .    from the point of view of grain alignment theory",
    "this paradox can be explained as a selection effect .",
    "indeed , far - infrared emission polarimetry selects warm grains , often in the vicinity of young massive stars .",
    "such grains find themselves in the environments far from equilibrium .",
    "for instance , our table 3 shows that these grains will rotate suprathermally due to radiative torques . on the contrary , the near infrared background starlight observations are sensitive to the whole sample of grains along the line from the source to the observer .",
    "the situation is aggravated by the fact that observations of background starlight in the optical and near infrared are most often performed in dark quiescent clouds , while the observations of far - infrared emission are most often performed in the regions of massive star formation ( see davidson et al .",
    "1995 , dotson 1995 , hildebrand & dragovan 1995 ) .",
    "this means direct comparison of background starlight polarimetry and thermal emission polarimetry is diffucult using existing data .    in dark clouds like l1755",
    ", we expect to detect polarized emission emanating from the vicinity of any low mass stars formed there , but the bulk of the cloud interior should not emit much polarized radiation if our understanding of the conditions within l1755 and our theory of grain alignment are adequate .",

    "thus we expect near - infrared background starlight polarimetry to reveal the structure of magnetic fields only in dense cloud _ exteriors _ , and to have no relation to the field structure for the regions corresponding to @xmath4 . to",
    "what particular extinction magnetic fields can be traced using background star light polarimetry remains to be determined ( see arce et al .",
    ". this important question should be addressed by concerted efforts of observers and theoreticians . we may further expect that emission polarimetry studies of the regions similar to l1755 may not give insight into the magnetic field structure for these cold high extinction regions , apart from small regions surrounding low - mass stars forming there .    on the contrary",
    ", emission studies of regions of massive star formation should be a reliable tool for revealing magnetic field structure there .",
    "this technique , however , is biased against cold regions where dust emission is low .",
    "our quantitative study of six types of alignment mechanisms predicts almost no polarization from the interiors of dark clouds and appreciable polarization from the cloud exteriors . adopting l1755 as a test case",
    ", we have shown that a number of mechanisms , including paramagnetic alignment of spm grains and alignment by radiative torques , provide efficient orientation of grains in the outermost regions of this cloud . at some moderate optical depth , still in the outer region , the purcell alignment of ordinary paramagnetic grains may dominate radiative torques . because all the alignment mechanisms studied fail in the interior region of l1755 we do not expect significant alignment there . this difference in alignment efficiency can provide a natural explanation of why no increase of polarization with optical depth is seen in l1755 ( goodman et al .",
    "1995 ) , and it is consistent with a prediction of only marginal polarization of thermal emission emanating from grains in the interior of l1755 .    to test the picture presented here it might be useful to measure new - infrared polarization through a dark cloud which contains a cold dense inner zone , as in l1755 , and also a localized heat sourse , such as an embedded cluster .",

    "<S> a quantitative analysis of grain alignment in the filamentary dark cloud l1755 in ophiuchus is presented . </S>",
    "<S> we show , that the observed decrease of the polarization to extinction ratio for the inner parts of this quiescent dark cloud can be explained as a result of the decrease of the efficiency of grain alignment . </S>",
    "<S> we make quantitative estimates of grain alignment efficiency for six mechanisms , involving grains with either thermal or suprathermal rotation , interacting with either magnetic field or gaseous flow . </S>",
    "<S> we also make semiquantitative estimates of grain alignment by radiative torques . we show that in conditions typical of dark cloud interiors , all known major mechanisms of grain alignment fail . </S>",
    "<S> all the studied mechanisms predict polarization at least an order of magnitude below the currently detectable levels of @xmath0 . on the contrary , in the dark cloud environments where @xmath1 the grain alignment can be much more efficient . there </S>",
    "<S> the alignment of suprathermally rotating grains with superparamagentic inclusions , and possibly also radiative torques account for observed polarization . </S>",
    "<S> these results apply to l1755 , which we model in detail and probably also to b216 and other similar dark clouds . </S>",
    "<S> our study suggests an explanation for the difference in results obtained through polarimetry of background starlight and polarized thermal emission from the dust itself . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture that the emission polarimetry selectively reveals aligned grains in the environment far from thermodynamic equilibrium as opposed to starlight polarization studies that probe the alignment of grains all the way along the line of sight , including the interiors of dark quiescent clouds , where no alignment is possible . </S>"
