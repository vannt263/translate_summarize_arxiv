    "a neutron star is a compact star which contains many neutrons .",
    "the theory of general relativity predicts the existence of a maximum mass above which the neutron star is unstable and collapses into a quark star or black hole .",
    "the maximum mass of a neutron star depends on the interaction between particles , and thus the equation of state ( eos ) of the system .",
    "the stiffer the eos , the larger the maximum mass of neutron star . in addition",
    ", the rotation of the neutron star leads to higher values of the maximum mass .",
    "since the neutron star contains dense asymmetric nuclear matter , one should apply the eos of strongly interacting asymmetric nuclear matter to investigate the bulk properties of the star .",
    "in addition , some authors have studied the effects of the existence of other particles , such as hyperons , meson condensates , and quarks , in the core of neutron stars on the maximum mass @xcite .    from observation ,",
    "radio pulsars show large masses of about @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "for example , according to @xcite , the mass of neutron star exo 07482676 is measured to be @xmath2 and the radius equal to @xmath3 . from theory , stiff eoss like the neutron matter ( nm ) eos in sly230a and sly230b models @xcite , can result in such large masses and mass - radius relations .",
    "nevertheless , in some observations - such as exo 1745 - 248 with mass @xmath4 and radius @xmath5 @xcite , the neutron star in 4u 1608 - 52 with mass @xmath6 and radius @xmath7 @xcite , and also the neutron star in the low - mass x - ray binary 4u 1820 - 30 with mass @xmath8 and radius @xmath9 @xcite,- the results are different .",
    "it can be shown that soft eoss are needed to lead these mass - radius relations from observation .",
    "different equations of state for pure nuclear matter that have been obtained using different methods , such as the variational method with @xmath10 potential plus the uix potential or @xmath10 potential plus a three - body uix potential @xcite , and dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock models @xcite can not predict some observational data , such as 4u 1608 - 52 and 4u 1820 - 30 @xcite . therefore , this rules out the possibility of the existence of the pure nuclear matter in the neutron star .",
    "one explanation for these observations is that the existence of some particles , such as quarks , mesons , and hyperons , in the neutron star can lead to soft eoss and the mass - radius relations in agreement with these observations @xcite .",
    "in addition , another possibility that leads to these mass - radius relations is the existence of dark matter ( dm ) in the neutron star .",
    "cosmological structure @xcite , gravitational lensing @xcite , and galactic rotational curve @xcite are some observations that could confirm the existence of dm . according to @xcite , the contributions of ordinary matter , dm , and dark energy in the universe are @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "supposing the existence of dm , it should be present in all astrophysical objects @xcite .",
    "the dm may be accreted to the neutron stars because of the large density of the neutron star matter @xcite . therefore , to study models of dm , neutron stars are of much interest in astrophysics and astroparticle physics @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that self - annihilating neutralino wimp dm accreted onto neutron stars may lead to seeding compact objects with long - lived lumps of strange - quark matter @xcite . the heating caused by possible dm annihilation in neutron stars may be an observable @xcite since the neutron star itself does not burn .",
    "in addition , it has been indicated that self - annihilation of dm in neutron stars can change their linear and angular momentum @xcite , as well as the cooling properties of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the critical phases of stellar evolution could be modified in the presence of relatively small amounts of dm @xcite .",
    "because of the possibility of the existence of dm in neutron stars , a model called the dark - matter admixed neutron star ( dmans ) has been considered @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms for accumulating dm in a neutron star can result both from the stellar formation process and from subsequent accumulation by accretion of dm particles during the stellar lifetime @xcite .",
    "the dm inside the stars alters the structure and may lead to the collapse of a neutron star @xcite .",
    "the structure of these stars is still an open issue because of the unknown nature of dm .",
    "however , it is useful to study the structure of dmanss using existing information on dm .",
    "the dmans is a two - fluid system where the neutron star matter and dm interact only through gravitational force @xcite . in order to study the structure of these stars",
    ", the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation is separated into two different sets for the neutron star and dark components inside the star @xcite .",
    "the mass - radius relation of dmanss which is affected by the dm , is one of the observational results that is possible to measure . the basic equation for dm to study the structure of dmanss is the dm eos @xcite .",
    "applying a method that combines kinematic and gravitational lensing data to test the widely adopted assumption of pressureless dm , the dm eos has been measured @xcite .",
    "moreover , by modeling galactic halos describing the dm as a nonzero pressure fluid and using observational data of the rotation curves of galaxies , a dm eos has been obtained @xcite .",
    "some previous studies have been performed to investigate the structure of dmanss @xcite .",
    "the general - relativistic hydrostatic equations have been generalized to spherical objects with multiple fluids that interact by gravity @xcite .",
    "moreover , assuming that the microphysics is the same in the two sectors of the dmanss , the effects of mirror dm on neutron star structure have been studied .",
    "it was concluded that the structure depends on the relative number of mirror baryons to ordinary baryons . supposing that dm is made of some form of stable and long - living particles that can accumulate in the star , it has been shown that all mass - radius measurements can be explained with one nuclear matter eos and a dark core of varying relative size @xcite .",
    "consequently , observational data , which provide a test of the theory , will become a powerful tool for the determination of dm @xcite .",
    "considering non - self - annihilating dm particles of mass @xmath14 along with normal nuclear matter , and using a general relativistic two - fluid formalism , the properties of dmanss have been studied @xcite .",
    "it was found that a new class of compact stars consisting of a small normal matter core with radius of a few km within a 10 km dm halo can exist . employing a general relativistic , two - fluid formalism to study the admixture of degenerate",
    "dm and normal nuclear matter shows that a new class of compact stars that are dominated by dm can exist @xcite .",
    "these stars have a small neutron star matter core , with radius of a few km embedded in a larger 10 km dm halo .",
    "in addition , these dmanss have two classes of oscillation modes .",
    "the first class of modes reduces to the same set of modes for ordinary neutron stars without dm , and the second class of modes is due to dm . in a consistent dmans model ,",
    "considering dm particles to behave like fermions which interact with a certain repulsive interaction , it has been found that dm would soften the eos more strongly than hyperons , reducing the maximum mass of the star @xcite .",
    "however , with small mass particles , the maximum mass could be larger than @xmath1 .",
    "the effects of fermionic dm on the properties of neutron stars using the two - fluid tov formalism have been studied @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the mass of dm candidates , the amount of dm , and interactions among dm candidates affect the mass - radius relationship .",
    "in addition , the dm in a dmans results in a spread of mass - radius relationships , and in some cases the dm distribution can surpass the nm distribution to form a dm halo . it has been confirmed that the dm admixture in neutron stars leads to the shrinkage of the nm surface , which results in the observation of a small radius .",
    "moreover , the dm distribution can surpass the neutron star matter distribution and form a dm halo when the dm candidates have low mass or there is repulsion of dm . with a the large dm fraction in the dmanss , the repulsive interaction among dm may result in stars with a mass of above @xmath1 . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate the properties of dmanss using the skyrme interaction in the neutron star matter and the dm eos obtained from the rotational curves of galaxies in a general relativistic , two - fluid formalism .",
    "in this study , we employ the nm eos that has been derived in the skyrme framework @xcite .",
    "this equation is the result of the skyrme effective force , sly230b , with the improvement in the behavior with respect to the isospin degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "the eos of nm in the sly230b parametrization is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "recently , the dm eos has been presented using the velocity profile of galaxies @xcite . in this study",
    ", we apply the pseudo isothermal model in which the dm density profile determines the velocity profile @xcite .",
    "the eos for the pseudo - isothermal density profile is as follows @xcite , @xmath15 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the density and pressure of dm , respectively . in addition ,",
    "@xmath18 and @xmath19 are the only free parameters of the eos , which for the dm in galaxies correspond to the central density and pressure , respectively @xcite .",
    "it has been found that this eos has a functional dependence that is universal for all galaxies , and the mentioned free parameters are related to the evolution history of the galaxy . using the eos in equation ( [ 213 ] ) and the rotational curve data",
    ", one can predict the central pressure and density of the galaxies . here , we suppose that the dm in dmanss also behaves according to this eos .",
    "however , one should be careful about the value of the free parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 in the eos .",
    "a logical choice that is similar to the case of galaxies is that the values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 are of the order of the central density and pressure of neutron stars , respectively , i.e. , @xmath20 for the density and @xmath21 for the pressure .",
    "we consider 12 eoss with the value @xmath22 and different values of @xmath19 , from @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "these eoss are presented in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "we should note that we have used units in which g = c = 1 , and therefore the mass density and energy density of dm are equal , i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "it is clear that the increase in the value of @xmath19 leads to more stiffness in the eos .",
    "in addition , it is possible to consider dmanss in which the dm sector is composed by free fermions with arbitrary masses @xcite . in this case",

    "the eos with mass @xmath0 for the fermions is presented in figure [ fig12 ] .    in this work ,",
    "we study a dm admixed neutron star with two concentric spheres : one containing the nm and the other the dm .",
    "the eos of nm in the nm sphere is presented in figure [ fig1 ] , and the eoss of dm in the dm sphere are given in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig12 ] . in our calculations for the nm sphere , in the crust at densities",
    "lower than @xmath32 , we use the eos calculated by @xcite .",
    "the contribution of dm in the dmans can be different and depends on the history of the star @xcite and the way that it originates @xcite .",
    "the gravitational field of the normal star in all phases of evolution can affect the dm and capture it into the star .",
    "this is more probable when the star is more compact .",
    "in contrast , the opposite scenario in which the dm objects trap the baryons has been also proposed @xcite . in this case",
    ", a more significant contribution of dm in the dmans is expected . in this study , we explore dmanss with different proportions of dm in the center of the dmans .",
    "this will be done by considering different central pressure ratios , i.e. , central dm pressure to central nm pressure ratio @xmath33 , for the dmans .",
    "the zero pressure ratio , @xmath34 , shows a normal neutron star .            in our calculations of the dmans structure ,",
    "we apply the two - fluid formalism for the nm and dm presented by @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", it is proposed that dm interacts with nm just through gravity .",
    "one static and spherically symmetric space - time with the line element , ( we use the units in which g = c = 1 ) , @xmath35 and the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid , @xmath36 are considered . in the above equation ,",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath37 are the total pressure and total energy density , respectively .",
    "the total energy density is related to the rest - mass energy density ( @xmath38 ) and internal energy density ( @xmath39 ) by @xmath40 in our system , the total pressure and total energy density are the results of both nm and dm quantities , @xmath41 @xmath42 in which @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the pressure and energy density of neutron ( @xmath45 ) and dark ( @xmath46 ) matter at position @xmath47 from the center of the star , respectively . by applying some calculations ,",

    "@xmath52 is the total mass inside a sphere with radius @xmath47 .",
    "this separation for dm and nm is due to the assumption that the two sectors interact just via gravity .",
    "the structure of dmans is described by these two - fluid tov equations .",
    "the condition for the dmans radius , @xmath53 , and mass , @xmath54 , is @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the radius and mass of the nm sphere and dm sphere are determined with the conditions @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the radial dependencies of the pressure and density are different in the two sectors .",
    "figures [ fig3]-[fig31 ] show the total mass of the dmans versus the radius of the nm sphere ( @xmath58 relation ) for a normal neutron star and dmanss with different dm equations of state ( dmeoss ) when the central pressures of nm and dm are the same , i.e. , @xmath59 . the curves that apply constraints for the mass and radius , i.e. , by the general relativity @xmath60 ( gr ) , by the finite pressure @xmath61 ( finite p ) , by causality @xmath62 ( causality ) , and by the rotation of 716 hz pulsar j1748 - 2446ad ( rotation )",
    ", are also presented @xcite .",
    "the mass - radius relations that pass in the permitted region are acceptable .",
    "we can see that with all dmeoss the radius of a dmans is smaller than the radius of a normal neutron star with the same mass .",
    "this decrease of radius in dmanss is in agreement with previous results @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the @xmath58 relations obtained using dmeoss corresponding to @xmath63 show a behavior like that of normal neutron stars that are gravitationally bound .",
    "however , the other dmeoss , which are the stiffer equations of state , lead to @xmath58 relations that are significantly different from the normal neutron stars .",
    "such @xmath58 relations with different slopes , representing the self - bound dmanss , are the result of the interaction between dm and nm .",
    "the significant effects of the stiff dm equations of state on @xmath58 relations have been also mentioned in @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that the @xmath58 relation for the dmeos with @xmath64 is approximately in agreement with the result related to the dmeos with @xmath0 .",
    "figures [ fig3]-[fig31 ] show that , for some @xmath58 relations , with a value of @xmath65 two possible dmanss with different masses can exist .",
    "this is a result of different degrees of dm domination in dmanss .",
    "put differently , two equal sized dmanss that are affected by the dm differently have different masses .",
    "for example , consider a @xmath58 relation with @xmath64 . with this dmeos , two dmanss with similar radii @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "have masses of about @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively",
    ". the ratios of the mass of the dm sphere to the total mass for these two dmanss are @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively , indicating the greater effect of dm in the former .",
    "in addition , in the case of @xmath0 , two dmanss with radii of @xmath72 and @xmath73 have masses of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and the ratios of @xmath76 are 0.29 and 0.03 , respectively .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     tables  [ table4]-[table41 ] present the mass and radius of the dark and nm spheres of the maximum mass dmanss with different dmeoss and for various values of central pressure ratio .",
    "we can see that the mass of a dm sphere increases when the central pressure ratio increases .",
    "this effect is more significant in the case of @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , with this dmeos the mass of the nm sphere decreases as the central pressure ratio grows . in the case with @xmath78 , for all given values of central pressure ratio the mass of the nm sphere is larger than the dm sphere . therefore , the dmanss are nm - dominated in these cases . however , for stars with @xmath77 and @xmath79 , as well as the stars with @xmath0 and @xmath80 , the dm sphere is heavier than the nm one .",
    "thus , these stars are dm - dominated .",
    "it is obvious from tables  [ table4]-[table41 ] that for the neutron dominated dmanss the halo of dm is confined within the nm sphere . in contrast , in the dm dominated dmanss the nm sphere is located inside the halo of dm which is in agreement with other investigations @xcite .",
    "considering two stars with the same mass - one of them a normal neutron star and the other a dmans in which the nm sphere is surrounded by the halo of dm - they have the same gravitational effects owing to their equal mass .",
    "however , the visible radius of the dmans is smaller than the normal neutron star .",
    "therefore , the gravitational redshift of spectral lines can be used to investigate these two stars .",
    "figures [ fig10]-[fig111 ] present the gravitational redshifts of a normal neutron star and dmanss with different dmeoss , and various values of central pressure ratio . in all cases",
    ", the existence of dm leads to higher values of gravitational redshift compared with normal neutron stars , in agreement with previous reports @xcite .",
    "moreover , the gravitational redshift in the dmanss with @xmath0 is larger than in the cases with @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "figures [ fig10]-[fig111 ] indicate that the effects of dm on the gravitational redshift are more significant in stars with the higher values of @xmath83 .",
    "these results can be used to distinguish the normal neutron stars from dmanss with different dmeoss and contributions of dm .",
    "applying the dmeoss from the rotational curves of galaxies , as well as the fermionic dmeos with @xmath0 and the nm eos from skyrme effective force , we have studied the structure of dmanss .",
    "we have found that the radius of a dmans is smaller than the radius of a normal neutron star with the same mass .",
    "our results show that the mass - radius relations are affected by both the dmeos and central pressure ratio of dm to nm . specifically ,",
    "depending on the dmeos and the central pressure ratio , the dmans can be a gravitationally or self - bound star .",
    "additionally , it has been confirmed that in some cases two dmanss with equal visible radii but different masses can exist .",
    "this fact is a consequence of different degrees of dm domination in dmanss .",
    "we have shown that , with all dmeoss , the maximum mass of the dmans is lower than the normal neutron star .",
    "the observed neutron stars exo 1745 - 248 , 4u 1608 - 52 , and 4u 1820 - 30 , which are inconsistent with the previous observations and theoretical properties of normal neutron stars , can be explained with our model .",
    "we have confirmed that some dmeoss and central pressure ratios considered in this work result in dm - dominated neutron stars with a halo of dm around a small nm sphere .",
    "our calculations suggest that the observed neutron stars exo 1745 - 248 , 4u 1608 - 52 , and 4u 1820 - 30 may be dm - dominated neutron stars .",
    "it has been clarified that the radius of the nm sphere decreases while the radius of the dm sphere increases as the central pressure ratio grows . in addition , the mass of the dm sphere increases with the increase of central pressure ratio . moreover , the dmanss with high values of central pressure ratio are dm - dominated neutron stars .",
    "finally , we have shown that the existence of dm in the dmanss results in increased gravitational redshift ."
