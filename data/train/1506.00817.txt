    "despite being an extremely succesful theory to predict the outcome of experiments with particles and other microscopic objects , quantum mechanics ( qm ) is believed by many to be incomplete or , at least , not fully understood .",
    "in particular , the  strange \" or non - classical phenomena of qm , like self - interference and born s rule , are described in terms of abstract mathematical objects .",
    "although some have been ready to interpret the complex - valued wavefunction as a real object , wavefunctions are generally seen as mathematical tools serving to calculate probabilities from their square moduli .",
    "contrasting to real - valued mathematics and one - to - one mapping between real variables and observables of classical theories , the standard description is thus sometimes considered as purely operational .    in this paper a model is presented that , although very simple in terms of mathematical development and formalism , seems to be able to predict probability fields of at least free particles , and particularly self - interference , without using schrdinger equation , wavefunctions , or path integrals . the proposed model assumes a discrete spacetime under the form of a euclidean lattice .",
    "individual particle trajectories are described as random walks .",
    "transition probabilities are simple functions of a few quantities that are either randomly associated to the particles during their preparation , or stored in the lattice sites they visit during the walk .",
    "non - relativistic qm predictions are retrieved as probability distributions of similarly - prepared ensembles of particles . unlike the standard qm picture @xcite",
    ", the proposed model only uses integer - valued quantities and arithmetic operations , avoiding complex - valued operations on the random walks .",
    "the proposed model is different from ensemble interpretations @xcite in the sense that it also describes the behavior of individual particles .",
    "with respect to de broglie  bohm mechanics @xcite and deterministic trajectory representation @xcite , the proposed model introduces a non - deterministic behavior but does not appeal to non - localities .",
    "intrinsic indeterminism is already contained in stochastic interpretations of qm that are , however , mostly aimed at retrieving the schrdinger equation from a classical equation of motion plus a stochastic force .",
    "the born probability rule remains unexplained in this context @xcite , or is founded on the definition of probability density of particles as the squared intensity of an associated wave @xcite .",
    "this latter assumption is not used in the proposed approach , which in contrast predicts nonclassical consequences of born rule ( as double - slit interference ) only from the random walk features . however , unlike other corpuscolar models @xcite the proposed model is not restricted to double - slit intereference as it is not explicitly based on ad - hoc trigonometric functions inspired by the complex waveforms structure .",
    "the idea of lattice or discrete - time algorithms that reproduce particle propagation in the continuum limit is also not new .",
    "however , the proposed model uses the lattice only as the support for particle motion , not for wavefunctions or other mathematical operators as , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "while other random walks or spacetime quantizations @xcite are able to reproduce the emergence of schrdinger equation from pure combinatorics , again the born probability rule and thus interference are not explained in such models , while naturally emerges in the proposed one . in order to reproduce interference ,",
    "antiparticles are not appealed to , as in some abstract lattice gas models for waves @xcite , nor negative probabilities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 presents the assumptions concerning spacetime , which naturally lead to heisemberg s uncertainty principle .",
    "section  3 describes the model for free motion without quantum forces and retrieves de broglie relation and schrdinger equation .",
    "section  4 describes the model with quantum forces and shows numerical results for several self - interference scenarios .",
    "section  5 is just a short introduction to possible extensions to treat interacting particles and the transition to relativistic qm .",
    "the proposed model assumes that the spacetime is inherently discrete . limiting for simplicity the analysis to one dimension @xmath0 , that means that only values @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are meaningful .",
    "noninteger values of space and time are simply impossible in this picture .",
    "the two fundamental quantities @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the size of the lattice that constitutes the space and the fundamental temporal resolution , respectively .    under this assumption ,",
    "a particle s history consists of a succession of points @xmath7 in the spacetime , where @xmath8 is the discrete index that describes advance in history , here denoted as  iteration \" .",
    "advance in time is unidirectional and unitary , that is , @xmath9 follows necessarily @xmath10 .",
    "advance in space is still unitary but bidirectional .",
    "if in a certain iteration a particle resides at the location @xmath11 of the spatial lattice , in the next iteration the particle can only reside at locations @xmath12 , @xmath11 , or @xmath13 .",
    "the local velocity of this mechanism , @xmath14 , is a random variable that can take only the three discrete values @xmath15 , as described in sect .",
    "[ sec : single ] and sect .",
    "[ sec : interf ] .",
    "the maximum velocity that a particle can reach is the speed of light @xmath16 .",
    "light trajectory in the positive direction corresponds to @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "consequently , one constraint to the fundamental lattice quantities is necessarily @xmath19    the average velocity could only be estimated by an observer as a sample mean of successive @xmath20 s . every observation lasting @xmath21 iterations will give an approximation @xmath22 of the  true \" average velocity .",
    "consider , e.g. , @xmath23 .",
    "the observed velocity can be @xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "thus the uncertainty on @xmath22 is @xmath16 in absolute value . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the possible outcomes for the sample mean are @xmath16 , @xmath28 , @xmath25 , @xmath29 , and @xmath26 .",
    "thus the uncertainty on @xmath22 is @xmath28 in absolute value .",
    "extending these considerations , the uncertainty on @xmath22 after an observation lasting @xmath21 iterations is @xmath30 in lattice units .",
    "moreover , an observation lasting @xmath21 iterations necessarily implies a change in the position of the particle .",
    "the span of the particle during the observation ranges from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "thus the uncertainty on the position of the particle at the end of the observation is @xmath33 in lattice units .    using the two results above , and denoting @xmath34 and @xmath35 the uncertainties of velocity and position as a function of observation horizon @xmath21 , the relationship @xmath36 holds .",
    "the latter equation resembles the heisenberg uncertainty principle since it fixes an inverse proportionality between the uncertainty with which the velocity of a particle can be known and the uncertainty with which its position can be known .",
    "multiplying by the particle mass @xmath37 , and comparing ( [ eqn : heis ] ) to heisenberg uncertainty principle , one obtains that the two fundamental lattice quantities are related to the planck constant , @xmath38 the term @xmath39 ( the solid angle of a sphere ) holds for three - dimensional spaces . in our example case of a one - dimensional space , this term reduces to 2 , the measure of the unit 1-sphere .",
    "thus , combining ( [ eqn : cc ] ) with the accordingly modified ( [ eqn : hbar ] ) , the values for the fundamental lattice quantities are obtained as @xmath40 and @xmath41 note that the compton wavelength is retrieved as twice the fundamental lattice size @xmath5 .",
    "the role of mass is not completely clear at this point .",
    "likely , general relativity will serve to integrate it into the picture .",
    "this section will first describe the equations of motion of a free particle in the proposed model .",
    "then , the stochastic variables associated with the motion will be analyzed .",
    "finally , the equivalence with the wavefunction picture and schrdinger equation will be retrieved .",
    "this section describes the propagation rules of a particle on the lattice , or its _",
    "dynamics_.      as stated in the previous section , time can only increase by one unit at each iteration .",
    "time is re - initialized to zero whenever the particle interacts with the environment ( external forces ) .",
    "this event is called _ preparation _ in the following . a stochastic variable representing time at an iteration @xmath42",
    "could be introduced as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the most recent iteration when the particle has undergone preparation , that is , has interacted with the environment and has been actualized .",
    "however , @xmath45 would have a deterministic distribution , @xmath46 and thus it will be often replaced by its support @xmath47 in the following .",
    "consider now spatial dynamics . at each iteration ,",
    "the particle might jump to one of the nearest neighboring sites of the lattice , or stay at rest .",
    "the actual local trajectory is not deterministic , i.e. , it is not a prescribed function of previous parts of trajectory .",
    "rather , the local trajectory has the characteristics of a random walk .",
    "this point is very important and it implies that an intrinsic randomness affects the particle motion . generally , there is a different transition probability for each of the three possible transitions . in free motion without interference or external forces , these probabilities do not change with time . let me denote the transition probabilities @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "of course , @xmath51 moreover , the proposed model assumes that the expected value of @xmath52 is imprinted to the particle .",
    "this imprint is to be attributed to the preparation and is actualized every time the particle interacts with the environment ( in a way to be considered later ) .",
    "let me denote this expected value as _ momentum propensity _ @xmath53 , @xmath54=a - c .",

    ", the proposed model assumes that @xmath58 equation ( [ eqn : energy ] ) might be also interpreted in the following way : energy is the average of the  time energy \" and the  space energy \" , where the former contribution is always one , since time can only advance by one unit .",
    "consequently , ( [ eqn : a ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath59 appendix  [ app : matter ] shows that it is possible to retrieve the de broglie relation @xmath60 for  matter waves \" with the proposed model , involving the energy propensity @xmath57 .",
    "the equations in the previous section , in fixing the probability of each jump at each iteration @xmath42 , define the trajectory of the particle as a random walk .",
    "let me introduce the stochastic variables that describe the position of the particle , @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the site occupied at @xmath64 , i.e. , @xmath65 .",

    "consider the scenario where particles are emitted from a source located at the site @xmath67 of the lattice with an intrinsic value of @xmath53 , and thus of @xmath57 , determined by the preparation .",
    "time interval between two emissions is very large , so to exclude any interactions between successive particles .",
    "moreover , the single source excludes quantum interference .",
    "after one iteration or , equivalently , time step , the particle has a probability @xmath68 to be at the site @xmath69 , a probability @xmath70 to be at the site @xmath71 , and a probability @xmath16 to be at the site @xmath72 .",
    "after two iterations , the probabilities are : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 .",

    "similarly , @xmath88 .",
    "the estension to the more general case of @xmath89 is easily done by replacing @xmath11 with @xmath90 in the right - hand side of ( [ eqn : rhop ] ) .",

    "the function ( [ eqn : rhop ] ) has a limit for large @xmath10 s that can be derived in two equivalent ways .",
    "on the one hand , the equation of motion ( [ eqn : xstoc ] ) can be reviewed in the continuum limit as a stochastic differential equation reading @xmath92dn + \\sqrt{\\mathrm{var}[\\mathcal{v}_{n}]}db ,      \\label{eqn : sde}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is a brownian motion with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "now , from ( [ eqn : p])([eqn : a1 ] ) , the identity @xmath94=e - p^2=b$ ] follows .",

    "clearly , it is constant after that the site is visited for the first time and @xmath452 holds , with @xmath453 .",
    "thus the quantities @xmath454 are also constant and can be calculated by repeated application of rule ( [ eqn : wdecay ] ) , @xmath455 the probability that the site carries a boson with lifetime @xmath184 and momentum @xmath454 equals the product @xmath456 .",
    "consequently , the expected value of @xmath457 is @xmath458 = r'\\sum_{\\ell=0}^{\\tau}(1-r')^{\\ell } q_{1 } \\prod_{j=1}^{\\ell } \\left(1-\\frac{(\\delta q_1)^2}{j^2 } \\right ) .",

    "therefore , for both bosons  12 \" and  21 \" , @xmath458 = \\frac{\\sin(\\pi\\delta\\frac{\\xi}{\\tau})}{\\pi\\delta }      \\label{eqn : sin}\\ ] ] holds .",
    "the probability that the particle carries a boson  12 \" equals the probability that it carries a new boson , _ or _ a boson that is one iteration - old , _ or _",
    "a boson that is two iterations - old , etc . , all these events being mutually exclusive .",
    "such probability is therefore calculated as @xmath461=p_{12}+p_{12}(1-p_{12})+p_{12}(1-p_{12})^2+\\ldots = p_{12 } \\sum_{k=0}^{\\tau-1 } ( 1-p_{12})^k      \\label{eqn : prboson}\\ ] ] however , we consider large @xmath10 s probabilities to retrieve @xmath197 , so let @xmath10 in ( [ eqn : prboson ] ) tend to infinity .",
    "boson lifetime affects the momentum exchange , as per ( [ eqn : pdecay ] ) .",
    "thus the mean value of the boson momentum is calculated as @xmath210 = p_{12 } \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty } ( 1-p_{12})^k p_{12}^{(k ) }      \\label{eqn : p12}\\ ] ] from the definition ( [ eqn : pdecay ] ) , @xmath462 after some manipulations , the latter formula turns out to be formally equivalent to @xmath463 as it can be verified by inspection .",
    "therefore , ( [ eqn : p12 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath464}{p_{12}^{(0 ) } } = p_{12 } \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty } ( 1-p_{12})^k ( -1)^k { -1/2 \\choose k } = p_{12 } ( 1-(1-p_{12}))^{-1/2 } = \\sqrt{p_{12 } }      \\label{eqn : sqrt}\\ ] ] after having recognized in the right - hand side the binomial series @xmath465 multiplied by @xmath450 .",
    "the quantity @xmath466 is a stochastic variable on its own , since it takes a different value ( that of the resident boson ) for each site visited when a new pair of bosons is created . from ( [ eqn : pboson0 ] ) and ( [ eqn : sinc ] ) this stochastic variable tends to be distributed as @xmath467 with this result , equation ( [ eqn : sqrt ] ) is rewritten as @xmath210 = \\sqrt{p_1p_2 } \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(\\pi \\delta \\frac{\\mathcal{x}_n}{\\tau})}{\\pi\\delta } .\\ ] ]"
