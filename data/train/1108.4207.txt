    "<S> setting maxwell s equations are written on a @xmath2-manifold @xmath3 and the electromagnetic medium is described by an antisymmetric @xmath4-tensor @xmath1 on @xmath3 . then the electromagnetic medium @xmath1 determines a fourth order polynomial surface in each cotangent space called the _ fresnel surface _ @xmath5 and it acts as a generalisation of the light cone determined by a lorentz metric ; the fresnel surface parameterises wave - speeds as a function of direction @xcite . at each point in spacetime @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic medium depends , in general , on 36 free components . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the medium is _ skewon - free_. then there are only 21 free components and such medium describe non - dissipative medium . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in skewon - free medium poynting s theorem holds under suitable assumptions .    </S>",
    "<S> the above means that in the pre - metric setting we have two descriptions of electromagnetic medium : first , we have the @xmath4-tensor @xmath1 that contains the coefficients in maxwell s equations . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we also have the fresnel surface @xmath5 , which describes the behaviour of a wavespeed for a propagating electromagnetic wave . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath1 is known we can always compute @xmath5 by an explicit equation ( see equation ) . </S>",
    "<S> a more challenging question is to understand the converse dependence , or inverse problem : if the fresnel surface @xmath6 is known for some @xmath7 , what can we say about @xmath8 ? </S>",
    "<S> essentially this asks that if the behaviour of wave speed for an electromagnetic medium is known , what can we say about the medium ? </S>",
    "<S> these questions are of theoretical interest , but also of practical interest as they relate to understanding measured data in engineering applications like traveltime tomography in anisotropic medium . </S>",
    "<S> we will here only study the problem at a point @xmath7 since the dependence will never be unique . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the fresnel surface @xmath5 is always invariant under scalings and inversions of @xmath1 @xcite . in general , these are not the only invariances , and for a general @xmath1 the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath5 does not seem to be very well understood .    a natural first task is to characterise those mediums @xmath1 for which the fresnel surface @xmath5 is the light cone of a lorentz metric @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this question was raised in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a partial solution was given in @xcite , and ( in skewon - free mediums with real coefficients ) the complete solution was given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that if the fresnel surface is a light cone , then @xmath1 is necessarily proportional to a hodge star operator ( plus , possibly , an axion component proportional to the identity ) . for an alternative proof , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite , and for related results , see @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> area metric_. area metrics also appear when studying the propagation of a photon in a vacuum with a first order correction from quantum electrodynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the einstein field equations have also been generalised into equations where the unknown field is an area metric @xcite . for further examples , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite and for the differential geometry of area metrics , see @xcite . for maxwell </S>",
    "<S> s equations , the interpretation of condition _ ( iii ) _ is that differently polarised waves can propagate with different wave speeds . in such medium </S>",
    "<S> one should expect that propagation of electromagnetic waves is determined by null - geodesics of two lorentz metrics . </S>",
    "<S> a typical example of such medium is a uniaxial crystal for partial results describing when the fresnel surface factorises , see @xcite and in 3 dimensions , see @xcite .    in theorem [ thm : factormedium ] </S>",
    "<S> we show that there are only three medium classes with the above properties and we give explicit expressions in local coordinates for each class . of these classes , the first is a generalisation of uniaxial medium and the last seems to be unphysical ; heuristic arguments suggest that maxwell s equations are not hyperbolic in the last class . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea of the proof is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we will use the normal form theorem for area metrics derived in @xcite , which pointwise divides area metrics into @xmath10 metaclasses and gives explicit expressions in local coordinates for each metaclass . this result was also used in @xcite , and by @xcite we only need to consider the first 7 metaclasses . for each of these metaclasses , </S>",
    "<S> the fresnel surface can be written as @xmath11 for a homogeneous @xmath2th order polynomial @xmath12 with coefficients determined by @xmath8 . since @xmath8 is birefringent </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath13 factorises as @xmath14 into homogeneous @xmath15nd order polynomials @xmath16 . by identifying coefficients </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a system of polynomial equations in coefficients of @xmath13 and @xmath17 . in the last step </S>",
    "<S> we eliminate the coefficients in @xmath17 from these equations whence we obtain constraints on @xmath13 ( and hence on @xmath1 ) that much be satisfied when @xmath1 is birefringent . to eliminate variables we use the technique of _ grbner bases _ , which was also used in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a limitation of theorem [ thm : factormedium ] is that the explicit expression is only valid at a point . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is that the decomposition in @xcite essentially relies on the jordan normal form theorem for matrices , which is unstable under perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> another limitation is that we do not allow for complex coefficients in @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> . therefore mediums like _ chiral medium _ are not included in the mediums in theorem [ thm : factormedium ] .    </S>",
