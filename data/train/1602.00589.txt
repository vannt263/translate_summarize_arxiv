    "in studying functions of a complex variable , a natural problem is to determine the locations of the zeros of the functions .",
    "there are a number of recent interesting results on the zeros of modular forms .",
    "for instance , the zeros of hecke eigenforms of integer weight @xmath2 become equidistributed in the fundamental domain as @xmath3 ( see  @xcite and  @xcite ) , yet such forms still have many zeros on the boundary and center line of the fundamental domain  @xcite .",
    "duke and the second author  @xcite studied zero locations for a canonical basis @xmath4 for spaces of integer weight weakly holomorphic modular forms for @xmath5 .",
    "if the weight @xmath6 is written as @xmath7 with @xmath8 , then the basis elements have fourier expansions of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 as usual . if @xmath11 , then all of the zeros of @xmath12 in the standard fundamental domain for @xmath5 lie on the unit circle .",
    "these results were extended  @xcite to similar canonical bases @xmath13 for the spaces @xmath14 of weakly holomorphic modular forms of integer weight @xmath2 and level @xmath15 with poles only at the cusp at @xmath16 , showing that many of the zeros of the basis element @xmath17 lie on an appropriate arc if @xmath18 is large enough .    for spaces of modular forms with weight @xmath19 , canonical bases with similar fourier expansions exist .",
    "zagier  @xcite defined such bases for spaces of weakly holomorphic modular forms of level @xmath20 and weights @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfying kohnen s plus space condition , and analogous bases were shown in  @xcite to exist in level @xmath20 for all weights @xmath19 . in this paper",
    ", we address the natural question of whether the zeros of the modular forms in such a basis lie on an arc .",
    "let @xmath23 be the theta function @xmath24 .",
    "for @xmath25 with @xmath26 , let @xmath27 denote the space of holomorphic functions on the upper half @xmath28 of the complex plane which may have poles at the cusps , which transform like @xmath29 under the action of the group @xmath1 , and which satisfy kohnen s plus space condition , so that their fourier expansion is of the form @xmath30 .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the space @xmath27 has a canonical basis of modular forms @xmath4 with fourier expansion given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 depends only on @xmath2 .",
    "decompose the integer @xmath33 as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 we show in section  [ sec2 ] that each of these basis elements @xmath12 has exactly @xmath37 zeros in a fundamental domain for @xmath1 , where @xmath38 depends only on @xmath39 and the parity of @xmath18 , and where the nonnegative integer @xmath40 , defined precisely in section  [ sec2 ] , counts the number of initial zeros in a certain sequence of fourier coefficients of @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath42 be the arc in the upper half plane given by @xmath43 in this paper , we will prove the following theorem about the zeros of the basis elements @xmath12 .",

    "there are absolute , positive constants @xmath44 and @xmath45 such that if @xmath46 , then at least @xmath47 of the @xmath37 zeros of @xmath41 in a fundamental domain for @xmath1 lie on the arc @xmath42 .",
    "additionally , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the proof of the theorem uses contour integration on a generating function for the canonical basis elements @xmath41 to approximate @xmath41 by a real - valued trigonometric function on @xmath42 .",
    "we note that for specific values of @xmath2 , the bounds on @xmath44 and @xmath45 and the quantity @xmath50 can often be improved ; for instance , if @xmath51 we may take @xmath52 .",
    "in the case of weight @xmath53 , theorem  [ mainthm ] yields an interesting corollary pertaining to weak maass forms and mock modular forms . loosely speaking",
    ", a weak maass form is a smooth complex function defined on the upper half of the complex plane which transforms like a modular form , but is not necessarily holomorphic .",
    "such a function must also be annihilated by a laplacian operator , and satisfy suitable growth conditions in the cusps . from the definition , it follows that a weak maass form naturally decomposes into two parts , a `` holomorphic part , '' and a `` non - holomorphic '' part ; the holomorphic parts are commonly referred to as mock modular forms .",
    "( see @xcite or @xcite , for example . )",
    "a first example of a half - integral weight weak maass form arises from the function @xmath54 if we define its fourier coefficients by @xmath55 , then it was proved by gauss that @xmath56 where the values @xmath57 are the hurwitz class numbers .",
    "let @xmath58 be the generating function for the hurwitz class numbers .",
    "zagier @xcite beautifully showed that @xmath59 is in fact the holomorphic part of a weak maass form .",
    "more precisely , zagier showed that the function @xmath60 is a weight @xmath22 weak maass form of moderate growth on @xmath1 . here",
    ", @xmath61 denotes the incomplete gamma function .    by work of bruinier , the second author , and ono  @xcite",
    ", it turns out that zagier s weak maass form @xmath62 is naturally related to the basis functions @xmath63 studied here , for any positive integer @xmath64 which is a square .",
    "precisely , for such @xmath18 , the authors show that @xmath65 where the functions @xmath66 are the weight @xmath2 and index @xmath18 poincar series defined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 3.13 ) ) , which are weight @xmath2 weak maass forms of level @xmath20 .",
    "denote the holomorphic part of @xmath67 by @xmath68 . because @xmath69 is weakly holomorphic",
    ", we must have that @xmath70 that is , the basis elements @xmath71 may be expressed as the sum of two mock modular forms , one of which is the generating function @xmath72 for hurwitz class numbers , and the other of which is the holomorphic part of the poincar series @xmath67 . by theorem  [ mainthm ] , the basis functions @xmath73 have many zeros on @xmath42 ; thus , it must be the case that the mock modular forms given by @xmath72 and @xmath74 take on equal and opposite values at many points on @xmath42 .",
    "precisely , we have the following theorem .    given the above conditions on @xmath18 , there are at least @xmath75 points @xmath76 on the arc @xmath42 at which the mock modular generating function for hurwitz class numbers @xmath77 and the mock modular poincar series @xmath78 take on equal values .",
    "that is , for such points @xmath76 , we have that @xmath79    we note that a direct application of theorem  [ mainthm ] gives @xmath80 zeros of the form @xmath69 ; however , the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] in section  [ sec3 ] shows that for the weight @xmath53 , with @xmath81 , there is at least one extra zero .",
    "our results also lead to an interesting corollary in the case of weight @xmath82 for any positive integer @xmath64 which is not a square . in this case , it turns out that theorem  [ mainthm ] provides information about the zeros of the poincar series @xmath83 themselves .",
    "previously , rankin  @xcite addressed the problem of understanding the number of zeros of general poincar series of level 1 and even integer weight at least @xmath20 , and gave an explicit bound on the number of zeros lying on the intersection of the standard fundamental domain with the boundary of the unit disk .",
    "our work leads to results analogous to those of rankin in the case of weight @xmath82 , by virtue of the fact that for positive integers @xmath84 such that @xmath18 is not a square , we have from  @xcite that @xmath85 .",
    "thus , we have the following corollary to theorem  [ mainthm ] , giving locations for the zeros of certain weight @xmath22 poincar series .",
    "the number @xmath86 is equal to @xmath22 or @xmath87 , depending on whether @xmath18 is even or odd .",
    "[ corollary13 ] assume the notation above , and let @xmath64 such that @xmath18 is not a square .",
    "there is an absolute positive constant @xmath44 such that if @xmath88 , then at least @xmath89 of the @xmath90 zeros of the poincar series @xmath67 in a fundamental domain for @xmath1 lie on the arc @xmath42 . additionally , @xmath91 .",
    "we note again that the bounds appearing here , for @xmath92 , are better than appear in the general statement of theorem  [ mainthm ] .",
    "details supporting this computation appear in section  [ secerrorbound ] .    as an additional application , for any weight @xmath19",
    ", theorem  [ mainthm ] implies the following non - vanishing theorem for coefficients of modular forms in the canonical basis for @xmath93 .",

    "if @xmath102 is positive and large enough , many of the basis elements in theorem  [ lehmerthm ] are actually cusp forms .",
    "an analogous result in integer weights would resemble a weaker form of lehmer s conjecture on the nonvanishing of the coefficients of the cusp form @xmath103 , since @xmath104 is the first canonical basis element @xmath105 of weight 12 .",
    "see also  @xcite for additional results on the nonvanishing of coefficients of cusp forms of half integral weight .    in section  [ sec2 ] of this paper ,",
    "we give definitions , notation , and the proof of theorem  [ lehmerthm ] . the main argument in the proof of theorem  [ mainthm ] appears in section  [ sec3 ] , with associated computations appearing in sections  [ sec_akm ] ,  [ pfsec2 ] , and  [ secerrorbound ] .",

    "the basis elements have a fourier expansion given by @xmath121 here @xmath32 is equal to @xmath122 if @xmath123 is even and @xmath124 if @xmath123 is odd , and @xmath125 satisfies @xmath126 .",
    "all of the coefficients @xmath127 are integers .",
    "any fundamental domain for @xmath1 has three cusps , which we take to be at @xmath128 , and @xmath21 and which have widths @xmath112 , @xmath20 , @xmath112 respectively .",
    "we use a fundamental domain @xmath129 bordered by the vertical lines with real part @xmath130 and the semicircles defined by @xmath131 for @xmath132 $ ] .",
    "the valence formula for @xmath1 ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) tells us that for a modular form @xmath133 of half integral weight @xmath2 for @xmath1 , we have @xmath134 here , for points @xmath135 in the upper half plane , @xmath136 , the usual order of @xmath133 as an analytic function at @xmath135 . for the cusps @xmath137 , the quantity @xmath138 is determined by the @xmath139-expansion at each cusp .",
    "specifically , @xmath140 is the smallest exponent in the @xmath139-expansion of @xmath133 at @xmath16 , while for the cusp at @xmath141 we multiply the smallest power of @xmath139 in the fourier expansion of @xmath133 at @xmath141 by the cusp width 4 to get @xmath142 . for the cusp at @xmath21",
    "the cusp width is @xmath112 , and we find that @xmath143 is again the smallest exponent in the @xmath139-expansion at the cusp , but we note that since @xmath21 is an irregular cusp for @xmath1 for weights in @xmath144 , this exponent will be in @xmath145 if @xmath33 is odd and in @xmath146 if @xmath33 is even .",
    "for example , we find that for @xmath147 , we have @xmath148    we next want to understand the behavior of the basis element @xmath12 at the cusps at @xmath141 and @xmath21 .",
    "to do so , we use the @xmath149 case of a theorem appearing in  @xcite for levels @xmath150 . performing explicit computations with the projection operator similar to those in  @xcite",
    ", we find that if @xmath151 , then the expansions of @xmath152 at the cusps at @xmath141 and @xmath21 are given by @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 are constants .",
    "thus , if the fourier expansion of @xmath156 is given by @xmath157 , we have @xmath158 and since @xmath159 and @xmath160 differ by exactly @xmath21 , then the two terms cancel when @xmath161 is odd . since @xmath162",
    ", this gives @xmath163 similarly , we get cancellation for even exponents @xmath161 in the expansion of @xmath164 , resulting in the expansion @xmath165    examining this fourier expansion , we see that the orders of vanishing of a modular form of half integral weight in the kohnen plus space at the cusps @xmath166 of @xmath1 are related to the fourier expansion of the form at the cusp at @xmath16 . specifically , if @xmath167 with @xmath168 , then we have @xmath169    for example , let @xmath12 be a basis element for @xmath27 , where @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "the fourier expansion is @xmath172 and has exponents congruent to @xmath141 or @xmath173 , and we note that @xmath12 vanishes to order @xmath174 at the cusp at @xmath16 .",
    "thus , if @xmath18 is even , it follows that @xmath142 is @xmath175 , while @xmath143 is at least @xmath176 , with equality if the coefficient of @xmath177 is nonzero .",
    "if this coefficient is zero , then the first odd exponent in the fourier expansion is @xmath178 for some positive @xmath179 , which means that @xmath143 is equal to @xmath180 .",
    "if @xmath18 is odd , then @xmath181 , and @xmath142 is equal to @xmath182 for some nonnegative integer @xmath40 , with @xmath183 only if the coefficient of @xmath184 is nonzero . applying the valence formula",
    ", we find that there must be @xmath185 zeros in the fundamental domain if @xmath18 is even , and @xmath186 zeros in the fundamental domain if @xmath18 is odd .",
    "writing @xmath170 as before , similar computations for each value of @xmath39 show that @xmath12 has @xmath37 zeros in @xmath129 , where the constant @xmath187 is as follows .",
    "@xmath188 because @xmath189 , it can be checked that the number of zeros in @xmath129 is always an integer , as expected .    examining the fourier expansion @xmath190",
    "we see that the quantity @xmath40 counts the number of initial consecutive coefficients which are equal to zero in ( depending on the parity of @xmath18 ) either the sequence @xmath191 , or the appropriate sequence @xmath192 or @xmath193 .",
    "since theorem  [ mainthm ] gives lower bounds on the number of zeros in the upper half plane , we can find upper bounds for @xmath40 .",
    "specifically , we find that @xmath194 so if @xmath18 is large enough compared to @xmath195 it is impossible to have more than this many consecutive coefficients of even or odd powers of @xmath139 ( starting from @xmath196 ) vanishing in the fourier expansion of @xmath12 .",
    "because the fourier coefficients @xmath127 of the basis elements @xmath12 satisfy the zagier duality relation @xmath197 as proved in  @xcite , we may apply this duality to give theorem  [ lehmerthm ] .",
    "in this section , we prove theorem  [ mainthm ] , relying upon theorem  [ thm_fintegral ] and theorem  [ prop_akconstant ] , which will be established in sections  [ sec_akm ] and  [ pfsec2 ] .",
