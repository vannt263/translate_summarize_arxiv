    "the well - known sequence of fibonacci numbers ( sequence a000045 in the _ on - line encyclopedia of integer sequences _ ) is defined by @xmath0 , @xmath1 and for every @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the first few values of the sequence @xmath4 are reported in table [ tab : fibonumbers ] for reference .",
    "a basic property of fibonacci numbers ( that can be easily proved by induction ) is that @xmath5 plus the sum of the first @xmath6 fibonacci numbers is equal to the @xmath7-th fibonacci number :    @xmath8    we recall here a famous result , usually attributed to zeckendorf @xcite , but published earlier by lekkerkerker @xcite and which , in fact , is a special case of an older and more general result due to ostrowski @xcite .",
    "it permits us to use fibonacci numbers as a basis for representing integers :    [ theor : zeck ] every positive integer can be expressed uniquely as the sum of one or more distinct non - consecutive fibonacci numbers @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "for example , @xmath11 , and there is no other way to write @xmath12 as the sum of non - consecutive fibonacci numbers ( assuming the convention that @xmath13 is not used in the representation ) .",
    "thus , one can represent natural numbers as strings of @xmath14-@xmath5 bits , where the @xmath15-th bit ( from the right ) encodes the presence / absence of the @xmath16-th fibonacci number in the representation given by theorem [ theor : zeck ] .",
    "so for example the number @xmath12 is represented by @xmath17 .",
    "we call this representation of natural numbers the _ zeckendorf representation_.    the first few natural numbers and their zeckendorf representations are displayed in table [ tab : zeck ] , where we padded to the left with @xmath14s in order to have strings of the same length",
    ". note that with @xmath18 bits one can represent the first @xmath19 natural numbers .",
    "in fact , for every @xmath20 , there are exactly @xmath9 integers whose leftmost @xmath5 in the zeckendorf representation is in position @xmath6 ( starting from the right ) . from @xmath21 , we derive that one needs @xmath6 bits to represent the first @xmath22 natural numbers .",
    "the strings of length @xmath6 forming the zeckendorf representations of the first @xmath22 natural numbers are precisely all the @xmath14-@xmath5 strings of length @xmath6 not containing two consecutive @xmath5s .",
    "these strings are in lexicographic order if the natural numbers are in increasing order from @xmath14 to @xmath23 .",

    ", we set @xmath48 the first few fibonacci words are shown in table [ tab : fibowords01 ] .",
    "@xmath49    we also define the _ fibonacci infinite word _ @xmath50 as the limit of @xmath51 as @xmath6 goes to infinity .",
    "that is , @xmath50 is the infinite word whose @xmath6-th letter is the `` parity '' of the zeckendorf representation of @xmath6 : @xmath52    in the zeckendorf representation of an integer , when the @xmath6-th digit from the right is a @xmath5 , the @xmath53-th digit from the right is a @xmath14 .",
    "hence , the rightmost @xmath54 digits of the zeckendorf representations of the natural numbers from @xmath55 to @xmath23 are the same rightmost @xmath54 digits of the zeckendorf representations of the first @xmath4 natural numbers . for example , the @xmath56 rightmost digits of the zeckendorf representations of @xmath57 , @xmath18 and @xmath58 are , respectively , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , as well as the @xmath56 rightmost digits of the zeckendorf representations of the @xmath14 , @xmath5 and @xmath56 .",
    "we deduce that for every @xmath2 , one has @xmath62 for more details on fibonacci words the reader can see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "recall that a _ factorization _ of an infinite word @xmath63 is a sequence @xmath64 of finite words such that @xmath63 can be expressed as the concatenation of the elements of the sequence , i.e. , @xmath65 .    in general , exhibiting a factorization @xmath64 of an infinite word @xmath63 can be useful to better understand the combinatorics of @xmath63 , provided the sequence @xmath64 has non - trivial combinatorial properties  for example , all the words in the sequence are palindromes , squares , or prefixes of @xmath63 .",
    "another point of view consists in defining a factorization by some general rule that can be applied to any infinite word .",
    "the sequence @xmath64 is therefore determined by the particular instance of the infinite word @xmath63 ( as is the case , for example , in the lempel - ziv factorization or in the lyndon factorization , that we will see below ) . in this case",
    ", the word @xmath63 can have particular properties that make it a limit example for that particular factorization .    in next sections",
    ", we will show a number of factorizations of the fibonacci infinite word that make use of the fibonacci finite words and other related words .",
    "these factorizations have been introduced over the time in different papers , and we think it can be useful to collect them all together for reference .",
    "we also add some ( at least to the best of our knowledge ) novel factorizations .",
    "moreover , we present these factorizations in an order that allows us to provide a short and elementary proof for each of them , despite the original proofs being sometimes more involved or more technical .",
    "the first factorization of the fibonacci infinite word we exhibit is the following .",
    "the fibonacci infinite word can be obtained by concatenating @xmath14 and the fibonacci words : @xmath66    since for every @xmath67 , @xmath68 , it is sufficient to prove that , for every @xmath69 , @xmath70 occurs in @xmath50 starting at position @xmath71 . from @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 , so that @xmath70 has an occurrence in @xmath50 starting at position @xmath74 .",
    "let us consider the sequence @xmath75 of the palindromic prefixes of @xmath50 , also called _",
    "central words_. the first few values of the sequence @xmath76 are displayed in table [ tab : central ] , where @xmath77 denotes the empty word , i.e. , the word of length @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath78    as it is well - known , for every @xmath79 , @xmath75 is obtained from @xmath70 by removing the last two letters .",
    "more precisely , we have for every @xmath69 , @xmath80    the fundamental property of the central words is the following :    [ lem : central ] for every @xmath81 one has @xmath82    follows immediately from @xmath72 and @xmath83 .",
    "it is easy to see from @xmath72 that for every @xmath84 , one has @xmath85 .",
    "we have therefore from @xmath86 : @xmath87 analogously , since @xmath88 , we can write @xmath89    we now introduce a class of words that we call the _ co - fibonacci words_. although this class has appeared previously in the literature @xcite , to the best of our knowledge no one has yet given a name to them .",
    "the co - fibonacci words @xmath90 are defined by complementing the last two letters in the fibonacci words @xmath70 , that is , @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the letters such that @xmath94 .",
    "equivalently , co - fibonacci words can be defined by @xmath95 for every @xmath79 . the first few co -",
    "fibonacci words are displayed in table [ tab : cofibowords ] .",
    "@xmath96    the following lemma is a direct consequence of lemma [ lem : central ] .",

    "their name comes from the fact that among the @xmath114 factors of @xmath50 of length @xmath4 , there are @xmath4 of them that can be obtained one from each other by iteratively applying left ( or equivalently right ) rotation and one , the singular word , whose left ( or equivalently right ) rotation is not a factor of @xmath50 .",
    "wen and wen @xcite proved that the fibonacci infinite word can be obtained by concatenating the singular words :    the fibonacci infinite word is the concatenation of the singular words : @xmath115    indeed , ( [ singular ] ) follows directly from ( [ fibo ] ) and the definition of singular words , observing that the fibonacci words end by letter @xmath14 and @xmath5 alternatingly .",

    "the lempel - ziv factorization of a word @xmath63 is @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the first letter of @xmath63 and for every @xmath118 , @xmath105 is the shortest prefix of @xmath119 that occurs only once in the word @xmath120 .",
    "roughly speaking , at each step one searches for the shortest factor that did not appear before .",
