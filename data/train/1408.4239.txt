    "in the past years , dense wireless sensor network deployments have been exploited in novel sensing applications such as device - free localization ( dfl ) @xcite and non - invasive breathing monitoring @xcite , and used by residential monitoring @xcite , ambient assisted living @xcite and military @xcite systems .",
    "the aforementioned narrowband systems use measurements of the radio to extract information about people in the surrounding environment and therefore , such networks are referred to as rf sensor networks @xcite .",
    "these systems typically use the received signal strength ( rss ) measurements of the radio in order to quantify changes in the propagation channel .",
    "dfl systems aim at localizing and tracking people in a monitored area using the rss of low - cost and static transceivers . for this purpose , there are two model based approaches that are widely utilized : an imaging approach referred to as _ radio tomographic imaging _",
    "( rti ) @xcite , and a bayesian inference approach which is typically solved using sequential monte carlo methods @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the measured rss is related to a person s kinematic state , i.e. , position and velocity using a spatial rss model .",
    "however , the time domain rss measurements are only affected by instantaneous location of the person and therefore , the kinematic system is not expected to be completely observable .",
    "this in turn limits the performance of dfl systems .",
    "one solution to address this problem and to improve the accuracy of rss - based dfl is to include measurements that are related to the person s velocity . in this paper , we show that the peak frequency component of rss is a function of person s position and velocity .",
    "a moving person alters excess path length of the reflected signal which causes destructive and constructive fading sequentially resulting that the rss varies periodically @xcite .",
    "this observation necessarily implies that the power spectral density ( psd ) of the rss has impulsive spikes at frequencies defined by the rate at which the propagation medium is being altered .",
    "the frequency of the highest spike where the psd achieves its maximum , which we refer to as _ frequency domain rss measurement _ in this paper , is of particular interest since it is related to the person s position and velocity .",
    "we utilize this finding to estimate the person s kinematic state from the time and frequency domain rss measurements .",
    "in addition to augmenting the tracking algorithm with the new measurement , the frequency domain rss measurements are not as easily altered by noise , measurement equipment induced effects such as carrier and symbol synchronization , or electrical properties of the person .",
    "thus , the benefits of using the frequency domain rss measurements are two - fold .    in this paper , a particle filter is implemented to estimate kinematic state of a person from the time and frequency domain rss measurements .",
    "the tracking performance of the filter is evaluated using simulations and the development efforts are validated with experimental data .",
    "compared to a system relying solely on time domain measurements , the results suggest that the robustness to parameter changes is increased while the tracking accuracy is enhanced by @xmath0 or more when @xmath1 particles are used .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "the related work is discussed . in section [",
    "s : model ] , models for the time and frequency domain rss measurements are presented and the particle filter used for tracking is introduced . in section [ s : simulation_results ] , the system performance is evaluated using simulations and in section [ s : experimental_results ] , the development efforts are validated using experimental data .",
    "requirements and possibilities of velocity estimation are discussed in section [ s : discussion ] and conclusions are drawn in [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "in indoor environments , the rss measurements are typically dictated by multipath propagation causing the rss measurements to differ from the modeled and therefore , it has a negative impact on localization accuracy @xcite . to address this problem ,",
    "one can attempt to derive a more profound spatial model that accounts for uncertainties in the environment and propagation mechanisms .",
    "another possibility to improve the performance is to mitigate effects of the unknown factors by using special hardware features such as directional antennas @xcite , channel diversity @xcite or both @xcite .",
    "a third possibility is to utilize robust measurement metrics for localization purposes and in this paper , the frequency domain rss measurements are used .",
    "this metric is not as easily altered by noise , measurement equipment induced effects such as carrier and symbol synchronization , or electrical properties of the person . to date , the robustness of spectral estimation has been successfully used in rf sensor networks to monitor small breathing - induced changes in the propagation channel @xcite .    in rss - based dfl , the discrete - time constant velocity model ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) is widely utilized to track the position and velocity of the person @xcite .",
    "other commonly used models to describe the target dynamics include the one - tap autoregressive gaussian model where velocity is treated as noise @xcite , and the jump - state markov model which is suitable for describing the dynamics of a maneuvering object @xcite .",
    "for tracking , the aforementioned works solely rely in the time domain rss measurements and therefore , the kinematic system is not expected to be completely observable . in this work",
    ", we also use the discrete - time constant velocity model to describe the dynamics of the person .",
    "however , we incorporate the frequency domain measurements to the tracking algorithm to include measurements of the person s velocity .",
    "in addition to the contributions listed above , we use the following features to maximize performance of the system in this paper .",
    "directional antennas are used to limit the region where human - induced temporal fading is observed as in @xcite .",
    "in addition , channel diversity is exploited to increase the probability that at least one of the frequency channels follows the spatial model @xcite and to increase signal - to - noise ratio of the measurements .",
    "furthermore , the three - state measurement model proposed in @xcite is utilized so that both shadowing and reflection mechanism are accounted for .",
    "a typical narrowband receiver samples and outputs the rss every @xmath2 seconds , so that the measurement at time @xmath3 on frequency channel @xmath4 can be expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a communication system dependent gain , @xmath7 the channel gain and @xmath8 is zero - mean additive wideband noise .",
    "if the channel is stationary for the duration of interest , the statistical expectation @xmath9 of the measurements is equivalent to the time average . under such conditions ,",
    "the expected value reflects the site dependent and time - invariant channel characteristics .",
    "thus , removing the mean yields a signal which does not depend on the underlying measurement setup and environment .",
    "thereafter , time variations of the mean removed rss , given by @xmath10 reflects the possible changes in the propagation channel .    in this paper , the channels are combined by averaging to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the measurements .",
    "the mean - removed and combined rss measurements are denoted as @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is i.i.d .",
    "zero - mean additive wideband noise and @xmath14 is the number of channels .",
    "it is to be noted that averaging may not be the best method to combine the channels .",
    "this is because the measurements can differ considerably among the channels when using omni - directional antennas @xcite or when the person is far away from the los resulting that phase of the reflected signals are considerably different @xcite .",
    "averaging is justifiable for the development efforts of this paper because directional antennas are used and the person is tracked in the close vicinity of the los . in such scenarios , the rss measurements are expected to correlate highly among each other on the different channels .",
    "kaltiokallio _ et .",
    "al _ have recently presented that the temporal rss changes are caused by : i ) electronic noise , when a person is not present in the monitored area ; ii ) reflection , when a person is moving in the close proximity of the los ; iii ) shadowing , when a person is obstructing the los @xcite .",
    "based on the findings , a three - state temporal rss model was presented where @xmath15 in eq .",
    "is represented with respect to the state of the propagation medium as @xmath16 where @xmath17^t$ ] represents coordinates of the person and @xmath18 state of the propagation channel .    in non - fading state ,",
    "the propagation channel is stationary and @xmath13 dictates @xmath19 because a single realization of the fading process is observed .",
    "since the mean is removed , we have @xmath20 . in reflection state ,",
    "@xmath19 is dominated by single - bounce reflections and @xmath21 is given by @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is phase of the reflected signal and @xmath24 describes the relation between the los component and the reflected component . in shadowing state , shadowing dominates @xmath19 and @xmath25 can be represented by a _",
    "line integral _ traversing through the person along a straight line from tx to rx .",
    "if the person is modeled using an ellipse with uniform electrical properties , the total attenuation along the los is ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the attenuation factor , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the semi - minor and semi - major axis of the ellipse , @xmath30 is rotation of the person with respect to the transceivers and @xmath31 . for further details about the spatial models ,",
    "the readers are referred to @xcite where the models were originally derived .        in general ,",
    "path length of different propagation paths changes with time .",
    "this change can be due to movement of the tx , rx , dynamic objects in the environment , or any combination of the aforementioned ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch . 5 ) .",
    "as an outcome , phases of the received signals vary periodically at the rx causing time - varying changes in the rss referred to as _ small - scale fading_. when the transceivers are stationary , this phenomenon is effective when the person moves in close vicinity but not on the los . in other cases , either the rss is composed of random variations or it has a strong and almost constant decrease due to shadowing .",
    "therefore , the frequency content of the rss is informative only in reflection state , i.e. , when @xmath32 in eq .  .",
    "in the single - bounce reflection case , excess path length of the reflected signal @xmath33 determines the phase as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is wave length of the carrier frequency .",
    "since the rss of a single - bounce reflection is a periodic function , in @xcite it has been shown that its trigonometric fourier series representation is @xmath36 in which @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the base of the natural logarithm ; @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the carrier frequency and @xmath42 is the speed of light in free space .",
    "when the person moves with non - zero velocity at time @xmath43 , @xmath33 is a continuous function of time so that its taylor series expansion around @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 where superscript @xmath45 denotes the order of differentiation .",
    "consequently , for constant velocity movements we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 and error @xmath48 is a function of @xmath49 . in case the second and higher order terms",
    "can be ignored , plugging eq .   into eq .",
    "yields @xmath50 the constant term @xmath51 is the phase of the cosine functions and it has no impact on the amplitude spectrum of @xmath52 . consequently , the spectrum has peaks around @xmath53 and locally the spectrum has the form of a dirac - delta convolved with the spectrum of @xmath54 .    since @xmath55",
    ", we have @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "this implies that the peak of the frequency spectrum of @xmath15 is around the instantaneous frequency of the first cosine function in eq .",
    ", that is @xmath58 where excess path length of the reflected signal is defined as @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are coordinates of the reflection point , receiver and transmitter in corresponding order .",
    "when the transceivers are stationary , only the velocity of the reflector , @xmath63 , effects @xmath64 in eq .  ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath65 in eq .   the chain rule of differentiation has been used to derive the equation from eq .  .",
    "now , eq .   can be compactly expressed as @xmath66 in which @xmath67 and @xmath68 have unity norm and the derivative only exists when @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath71 has a very strong dc component , convolving its spectrum with the dirac - delta function does not change the frequency of the peak .",
    "therefore , the strongest frequency component of @xmath15 is a function of both velocity and position of the reflector , and it does not depend on @xmath72 . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath73 does not depend on the irregularities of the communication system , large scale losses of the environment , and electrical properties of the reflector .      in order to quantify the propagation channel s change rate in eq .",
    "we use a sequence of @xmath74 to calculate the power spectral density ( psd ) of the measurements , and find the frequency of its peak , i.e. , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the frequency , @xmath2 is the sampling interval and @xmath77 is the number of samples . for the reasons discussed in the preceding section ,",
    "now we have @xmath78 where @xmath79 is zero - mean additive measurement noise .",
    "the noise @xmath79 depends on the statistical properties of the frequency estimate .",
    "the intensity of @xmath79 is dictated by variance of @xmath13 in eq .",
    ", sampling rate , number of dft points , higher order harmonics in eq .  , and higher order terms in eq .",
    "thus , for signal - to - noise ratio values high enough not to cause thresholding effect @xcite and when the higher order terms in eq .   can be ignored , @xmath79 may be assumed independent of @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , if the number of dft points is high enough and under the aforementioned conditions , @xmath79 can be taken as a normal variate .",
    "consequently , we assume that @xmath79 is a zero - mean gaussian .",
    "it is to be noted that since @xmath80 is evaluated over a time window of length @xmath77 , it measures the average rate of change over this time window . to model this appropriately , also @xmath81 has to be evaluated in the _ average position _ over time window @xmath77 . for constant velocity @xmath82 ,",

    "we anticipate that exploiting the frequency domain measurements is especially beneficial when using omni - directional antennas and in environments where rss - based dfl is difficult , i.e. , in through - wall scenarios and in cluttered indoor environments .",
    "we will explore this possibility in future research .    using frequency domain measurements for tracking sets stringent requirements on sampling frequency of the wireless channel . in this paper , we have demonstrated tracking when a person is moving at a speed of @xmath184 and shown that with such a speed , the propagation channel s change rate is approximately @xmath185 or below .",
    "thus , the channel should be sampled at @xmath186 or above to satisfy the nyquist rate .",
    "this sampling frequency is hard to accomplish in mesh networks where all transceivers are communicating with one another .",
    "moreover , exploiting channel diversity makes the task even more challenging since it increases the sampling rate with respect to the number of used channels .",
    "there are three options one can investigate to overcome this limitation .",
    "first and most importantly , the experiments are conducted with hardware that is designed for low - rate and low - power communications .",
    "using customized or alternative technologies such as bluetooth could be beneficial for rss - based dfl since the propagation medium could be sampled at a higher rate and frequency hopping would be part of the protocol implementation .",
    "second , the communication schedule could be designed adaptive based on the location of the person . in this case , only links that traverse near by the person s location would participate in the localization effort .",
    "third , compressed sensing could be used to reconstruct the signal of interest from undersampled rss measurements .",
    "in this paper , frequency content of the rss measurements is shown to contain information about a person s velocity . a closed form expression that relates the frequency content of the rss measurements to the person s position and velocity",
    "is derived .",
    "the system model is augmented with the additional measurement and a particle filter is implemented to track movements of a person .",
    "simulations are used to evaluate the system performance and experiments are conducted to validate the development efforts .",
    "the results suggest that the tracking accuracy is improved while the system s robustness to parameter changes is increased when the frequency domain measurements are plugged into the tracking algorithm .",
    "as discussed in the paper , the frequency domain measurements are a robust measurement metric for localization purposes and we anticipate that using them is especially beneficial with systems relying on omni - directional antennas and in environments where rss - based dfl is difficult , i.e. , in through - wall scenarios and in cluttered indoor environments .",

    "<S> typically , the person is localized using a spatial model that relates the time domain signal strength measurements to the person s position . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , one could exploit spectral properties of the received signal strength which reflects the rate at which the wireless propagation medium is being altered , an opportunity that has not been exploited in the related literature . in this paper , the power spectral density of the signal strength measurements </S>",
    "<S> are related to the person s position and velocity to augment the particle filter based tracking algorithm with an additional measurement . </S>",
    "<S> the system performance is evaluated using simulations and validated using experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> compared to a system relying solely on time domain measurements , the results suggest that the robustness to parameter changes is increased while the tracking accuracy is enhanced by 50% or more when 512 particles are used . </S>"
