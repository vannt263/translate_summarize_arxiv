    "in recent work  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) we have analysed some aspects of the cauchy problem for the einstein equations with data on a characteristic cone in all dimensions @xmath0 , see  @xcite and references therein for previous work on the subject . in this note",
    "we apply the results derived in  @xcite to present an existence theorem for this problem , with initial data which approach rapidly the flat metric near the tip of the light cone , see theorem  [ t23vii.1 ] below .",
    "the reader s attention is drawn to  @xcite , where sets of unconstrained data on a light - cone centered at past timelike infinity are given in dimension @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that by using normal coordinates centred at @xmath2 the characteristic cone @xmath3 of a given lorentzian metric can be written , at least in a neighbourhood of @xmath2 , as a cone in minkowski spacetime whose generators represent the null rays .",
    "it is therefore no geometric restriction to assume that the characteristic cone of the spacetime we are looking for is represented in some coordinates @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 of @xmath7 by the equation of a minkowskian cone with vertex @xmath2 , @xmath8 the parameter @xmath9 is an affine parameter when normal coordinates are used , and it is also going to be an affine parameter in the solutions that we are going to construct .",
    "coordinates @xmath10 as above , which moreover satisfy the wave - equation , @xmath11 , will be called _ normal - wave _ coordinates . given a smooth metric ,",
    "such coordinates can always be constructed ( see  @xcite or  @xcite ) by solving the wave equation in the domain of dependence of @xmath3 , with initial data the normal coordinates on @xmath3 . given a smooth metric , one obtains a coordinate system near the vertex , which suffices for our purposes . the coordinates",
    "@xmath12 will be normal - wave coordinates for the solution which we aim to construct .    given the coordinates @xmath13 we can define coordinates @xmath14 on @xmath7 by setting @xmath15 with @xmath16 local coordinates on @xmath17 .",
    "the null geodesics issued from @xmath2 have equation @xmath18 , @xmath19constant , so that @xmath20 is tangent to those geodesics . on @xmath21 ( but not outside of it in general )",
    "the spacetime metric @xmath22 that we attempt to construct takes the form ( we put an overbar to denote restriction to @xmath3 of spacetime quantities ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 are respectively an @xmath25-dependent scalar , one - form , and riemannian metric on @xmath17 .",
    "the symbol @xmath9 will be used interchangeably with @xmath26 .    to avoid ambiguities",
    ", we will write @xmath27 for the components of a metric tensor in the @xmath28 coordinates , and @xmath29 for the components in the coordinate system @xmath10 .",
    "this convention will be used regardless of whether @xmath22 is defined on the space - time , or only on the light - cone .",
    "the analysis in  @xcite uses a wave - map gauge , with minkowski target @xmath30 , with the light - cone of @xmath30 being the image by the wave - map @xmath31 of the light - cone of the metric @xmath22 that one seeks to construct .",
    "quite generally , a metric @xmath22 on a manifold @xmath32 will be said to be _ in @xmath33-wave - map gauge _ if the identity map @xmath34 is a harmonic diffeomorphism from the spacetime @xmath35 onto the pseudo - riemannian manifold ( @xmath36 . recall that a mapping @xmath37 is a harmonic map if it satisfies the equation , in abstract index notation , @xmath38 in a subset in which @xmath31 is the identity map defined by @xmath39 , the above equation reduces to @xmath40 , where the _ wave - gauge vector _",
    "@xmath41 is given in arbitrary coordinates by the formula @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the christoffel symbols of the _ target _ metric @xmath33 .",
    "see  @xcite for a more complete discussion .",
    "there are various ways of choosing free initial data for the cauchy problem for the vacuum einstein equations on the light - cone @xmath3 . in this work",
    "we choose as initial data a one - parameter family , parameterized by @xmath9 , of conformal classes of metrics @xmath44 $ ] on @xmath17 , thus @xmath45 is assumed to be conformal to @xmath46 , and where @xmath9 will be an affine parameter in the resulting vacuum space - time .",
    "the initial data needed for the evolution equations are the values of the metric tensor on the light - cone , which will be obtained from @xmath46 by solving a set of wave - map - gauge constraint equations derived in  @xcite , namely equations ( [ 3v.1 ] ) , ( [ 5vi.13 ] ) , ( [ xiabis])-([cafinal2 ] ) and ( [ 19viii.1 ] ) below . the main issue is then to understand the behaviour of the fields near the vertex of the light - cone , making sure that the @xmath47-coordinates components of the metric @xmath48 , obtained by solving the wave - map - gauge constraints , can be written as restrictions to the light - cone of sufficiently smooth functions on space - time , so that the pde existence theorem of  @xcite can be invoked to obtain the vacuum space - time metric .",
    "it is convenient to start with some notation .",
    "for @xmath49 and @xmath50 we shall say that a tensor field @xmath51 , of valence @xmath52 , defined for @xmath53 , is @xmath54 if there exists a constant @xmath55 such that @xmath56 where @xmath57 are coordinate components of @xmath58 , in a coordinate system which will be made clear as needed .",
    "[ t23vii.1 ] let @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "suppose that there exist smooth tensor fields @xmath66 on @xmath17 , @xmath67 , so that , in local charts on @xmath17 , the coordinate components @xmath68 satisfy @xmath69 then :    1 .",
    "there exist functions @xmath70 such that @xmath71 if there exists @xmath72 so that @xmath73 for @xmath74 , then @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "if moreover @xmath77 then there exists a @xmath78 lorentzian metric defined in a neighbourhood of the vertex of @xmath3 , with @xmath79 $ ] , which is vacuum to the future of @xmath2 .    roughly speaking , the index @xmath80 is the final sobolev differentiability of the solution .",
    "the ranges of indices above are only needed for the second part of the theorem , and arise from the fact that dossa s existence theorem  @xcite requires initial data which are of @xmath81 differentiability class in coordinates regular near the vertex .",
    "there is a loss of three derivatives when going from the free data @xmath68 to the full initial data @xmath82 , which brings the threshold up to @xmath83 .",
    "finally , the existence argument invokes the bianchi identity , which in its natural version requires a @xmath84 metric ; together with the sobolev embedding , this leads to the restriction @xmath62 .",
    "straightforward taylor expansions at @xmath2 show that a smooth metric on a space - time @xmath85 will lead to the form ( [ 30vi.5x ] ) of @xmath44 $ ] , with @xmath80 , @xmath86 and @xmath52 which can be chosen at will , and with @xmath87 .",
    "so ( [ 30vi.5x ] ) is necessary in this sense .          in view of our theorem above , to obtain a complete solution of the problem at hand it remains to provide an exhaustive description of those @xmath44 $ ] s that lead to ( [ 23vii.5 ] ) .",
    "we conjecture that ( [ 23vii.5 ] ) will hold for all @xmath46 s arising from the restriction of a smooth metric to a light - cone , where @xmath9 is an affine parameter . a similar problem arising on the null cone at past infinity in dimensions",
    "@xmath1 has been solved by friedrich in  @xcite , but no details have been presented .",
    "proof of theorem  [ t23vii.1 ] : we need to analyze the behaviour of the solutions of the wave - map - gauge constraint equations near the vertex of the cone .",
    "we start by noting that , for some smooth functions @xmath95 on @xmath17 , @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the matrix inverse of @xmath68 .",
    "further , for some smooth tensors @xmath98 on @xmath17 , @xmath99 note that @xmath100 is the @xmath59trace - free part of @xmath101 .",
    "this leads to , for some functions @xmath102 on @xmath17 , @xmath103 where @xmath104 has been defined in the left - hand side of .",
    "let @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the divergence of @xmath3 ( sometimes denoted by @xmath107 in the literature ; cf .",
    ", e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath108 in terms of @xmath12 , the vacuum raychadhuri equation @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is a null tangent to the generators of @xmath3 , reads @xmath111 using known arguments ( compare  @xcite and  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  8.2 ) ) , there exist functions @xmath112 such that @xmath113 we rewrite this as @xmath114 so that @xmath115 using this last formula , it is easy to establish existence of functions @xmath116 such that @xmath117 let us write @xmath118 from @xmath119 there exist functions @xmath120 such that : @xmath121 equation ( [ 30vi.8 ] ) implies that there exist smooth tensor fields @xmath122 on @xmath17 such that @xmath123 subsequently , @xmath124 for some tensor fields fields @xmath125 .    it is a consequence of the affine - parameterization condition and of the wave - gauge conditions that the function @xmath126 solves the equation ( see  @xcite for details ) @xmath127 set @xmath128 then ( [ 5vi.13 ] ) integrates to @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath131 we find successively @xmath132 for some @xmath133 .",
    "closer inspection shows that @xmath134 . integrating ( [ 30vi.12 ] ) ,",
    "we conclude that there exist functions @xmath135 such that @xmath136 if @xmath137 the sum from four to @xmath138 is understood as zero .",
    "one has a similar formula for @xmath139 .",
    "we pass now to a vector @xmath140 , defined as @xmath141 here the @xmath142 s are the christoffel symbols of the canonical metric @xmath59 on @xmath17 , @xmath143 is as in ( [ wavegauge0 ] ) , the @xmath144 s are the christoffel symbols of the @xmath145-dimensional metric @xmath146 , with associated covariant derivative operator @xmath147 , and @xmath148 , while @xmath149 in terms of @xmath150 the equation @xmath151 in wave - map gauge reads @xmath152 where @xmath153 . from what has been proved so far",
    "this last equation can be written as @xmath154 for some @xmath155 .",
    "the unique solution of this equation with the relevant behaviour at the origin satisfies @xmath156 for some @xmath157 . viewing ( [ xiabis ] ) as an equation for @xmath158 , we obtain @xmath159 for some @xmath160 .",
    "we finally need to integrate the third wave - map - gauge constraint , @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the einstein tensor : @xmath163 we need the formula , for some functions @xmath164 , @xmath165 and the result , for a minkowski target , @xmath166 with @xmath167 .",
    "hence @xmath168 for some functions @xmath169 .",
    "a straightforward analysis of the remaining terms in ( [ 19viii.1 ] ) shows that solutions with the required asymptotics satisfy , for some functions @xmath170 , @xmath171 in order to apply dossa s existence theory from  @xcite to the wave - map gauge reduced einstein equations , we transform the metric to coordinates @xmath172 , regular near the tip of the light - cone , defined as @xmath173 where @xmath174 . in these",
    "coordinates our wave - map - reduced einstein equations become the usual harmonically - reduced equations , which have the right structure for the existence results in  @xcite .",
    "one finds that there exist functions @xmath175 such that @xmath176 this proves the first part of theorem  [ t23vii.1 ] .",
    "now , for general @xmath66 s the sum @xmath177 will _ not _ be the restriction of a polynomial to the light - cone .",
    "assume , however , that this is the case .",
    "then the remainder term in the difference @xmath178 will be of the differentiability class @xmath179 with @xmath180 , as required by dossa for existence  @xcite , provided that @xmath181 the solution @xmath182 is then in dossa s space @xmath183 for some @xmath184 , which embeds into @xmath185 leading to , for small @xmath186 , @xmath187 in the coordinates @xmath172 the harmonicity vector can be calculated using the usual formula , @xmath188 which has bounded components in the @xmath172 coordinate system near the tip of the cone . the bianchi identity ( which , in its simplest version , requires a @xmath84 metric ;",
    "this raises the differentiability threshold to @xmath62 ) together with the arguments in  @xcite show then that @xmath189 and thus the solution of the wave - map reduced einstein equations , obtained from dossa s theorem , is also a solution of the vacuum einstein equations .",
