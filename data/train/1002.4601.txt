    "[ intro ]    the dark matter ( dm ) has become one of the most promising evidences in favor of physics beyond standard model of electroweak interactions ( sm ) .",
    "the converging paradigm to naturally explain this unseen component of matter is that it be a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , with mass scale ranging from tens of gev to few tev  @xcite . with recent data from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap )  @xcite , and several dm direct detection experiments running and projected  @xcite",
    ", we have powerful new tools to investigate particle physics models which just provide new particle content that would explain this dark component . besides , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is already running  @xcite and",
    "may be able to shed some light on the dm component too .",
    "another non - negotiable experimental evidence of new physics is neutrino mass , once the sm does not provide a mechanism to explain this issue and we need to add some new ingredient to do this job .",
    "even better if this addition brings some information on other challenges not covered by sm .",
    "it appears to us that these two clues about new physics could have some common origin .",
    "remember though that active neutrinos are underweight to merge into this picture , since their contribution to the density parameter , @xmath0 , is given by  @xcite , _ h^2 = .",
    "[ active ] on the other hand , sterile neutrinos could possess the right features to accomplish the task of being dark and play some role in neutrino mass generation  .",
    "this is particularly true in the model of ref .",
    "there the authors managed to get a realistic model for neutrino mass by adding right handed neutrinos and scalar multiplets in such a way as to obtain small neutrino masses and provide a scenario for leptogenesis .",
    "the interesting thing is that one of these neutrinos is sterile and stable , and could be a dm candidate .",
    "another such link between dm and sterile neutrinos is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a version of a left - right symmetric model is extended with a @xmath1 gauge symmetry .",
    "using some non - supersymmetric r - parity symmetry the authors get a stable neutrino interacting with electron and a charged scalar and analyze its viability as dm candidate . in such model",
    "there is no direct detection constraint since the interaction is leptophilic .",
    "we can even imagine a third model where these effective interactions would appear , the so called @xmath2rh@xmath3 model , a gauge extension of sm from @xmath4 to @xmath5 with right handed neutrinos as part of a fundamental representation under @xmath6 for the leptons  @xcite .",
    "besides being capable of generating appropriate neutrino masses  @xcite , it has a rich spectrum of scalars and at least one studied case of a wimp dm candidate  @xcite , among other nice features that help to tackle unsolved problems of sm .    in this work",
    "we would like to link some features of these non - supersymmetric models  @xcite in a simpler effective low energy model for dm sterile neutrino .",
    "we suppose the presence of a right handed neutrino , which reveals itself to be sterile , and two singlet scalars , a neutral and a charged one .",
    "the role of these scalars is to give this neutrino a mass and to couple it with a charged lepton .",
    "we restrict this lepton to be the electron for simplicity , though it could be extended to muon and/or tau leptons . in this way",
    ", it could be seen as a low energy limit of the models discussed above  @xcite .",
    "we are not going to stick with none of these particular models , since the features we are going to study here can serve for each one in some specific regime , but it is important to know that some larger scheme can be introduced to justify our approach . our main purpose in this work is to show that a sterile neutrino not only can represent the appropriate dm content of the universe , in agreement with the latest results of cdms - ii ( and xenon-10 )  @xcite , but also it demands a light sm higgs boson if dm has impinged a signal on the detector  @xcite .",
    "maybe this is the only connection with electroweak physics , an unusual feature when we want to solve the neutrino mass puzzle , since neutrino mixing can be potentially dangerous exactly because of its effects on the electroweak side and are constrained by big bang nucleosynthesis  @xcite . in this sense , while neutrino mass can be an indication of new physics , it is the dm that can offer the source of detection of an entirely new branch of the leptonic sector not available for the standard interactions , although implying a constraint to higgs boson mass .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec1 ]",
    ", we present our sterile neutrino model , identifying the physical fields ( mass eigenstates ) and impose the discrete symmetry which makes the sterile neutrino stable .",
    "next , in section  [ sec2 ] , we compute the relic abundance of our wimp candidate and its direct detection , paying some attention to the possible cdms - ii positive signal .",
    "we finally show our conclusions in section  [ sec3 ] .",
    "the model consists of a small extension of sm by including a singlet majorana neutrino , @xmath7 , plus a singlet charged scalar , @xmath8 and a singlet neutral scalar , @xmath9 .",
    "besides the mixing among the higgs doublet and the new singlet scalars , there is an interaction term coupling these singlets to the leptons  , as can be seen in the following lagrangian , & & l_kin - _1 ( n_r+ n_r^c ^ * ) + _2 ( e_r^+ + n_r^c ^- ) + & & - v^(,^ , ) , [ lagr ] where @xmath10 is the lagrangian term involving the kinetic terms for the singlet neutrino as well as for the singlet scalars , including the @xmath8 interaction with sm gauge bosons , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . from this lagrangian",
    "we observe that the scalars carry two units of lepton number ( called bileptons ) if we admit lepton number conservation .",
    "notice also that @xmath8 will have interaction terms with the photon and @xmath13 boson , since it possess nonzero hypercharge .",
    "the scalar potential in the above lagrangian , @xmath14 , embraces the new terms to be added to the sm higgs potential , in order to form the complete scalar potential , @xmath15 , given by , & & v(,^ , ) = m_^2^+ m_^2^*+ _ ^2 ^+ ^- + _(^)^2 + _(^*)^2 + & & + _(^+^-)^2",
    "+ _3(^)(^+^- ) + _4^+^-^*+_5^^*. [ pot ] where the field @xmath16 represents the usual sm scalar @xmath17 doublet .",
    "observe that our lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) , allows the presence of some extra terms not included here .",
    "for example , we could add a term connecting the lepton doublet , @xmath18 , with the singlet neutrino through the sm scalar doublet , @xmath19 , however , we want to avoid such terms since we are interested in explaining the dm component as constituted by the singlet neutrino .",
    "this term would imply its mixing with standard left handed neutrinos and consequently its decay .",
    "we choose to get rid of these kind of couplings by assigning a discrete symmetry to @xmath7 and @xmath8 , namely , ( n_r,^+)(-n_r,-^+ ) .",
    "[ discrete ] that is what make this singlet neutrino a sterile one , since it does not couple to any gauge boson of the sm and would leave no sign of its existence through the known interactions .",
    "this model is what we call a leptophilic model for the charged scalar in the sense that it does not mediate any interaction involving quarks .",
    "even if we had enforced this scalar to couple to some quark , this one should be an exotic quark , meaning that it would carry lepton number and be a bilepton too , if we want to preserve lepton symmetry from being broken explicitly .",
    "this kind of particles , scalar and quark bileptons , are very common in the class of models called 3 - 3 - 1  @xcite and a neutral scalar bilepton was already pointed as a wimp dm candidate in a version of 3 - 3 - 1 with right - handed neutrinos in the fundamental triplet representation  @xcite .    in this work we rely upon the possibility that some high energy fundamental theory is going to properly generate this effective model . in this way we consider the charged scalar mass scale as a free parameter , which can be of the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "meanwhile , the neutrino mass can be generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking due to a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) acquired by @xmath9 , @xmath20 , which we suppose to be real and assuming values around tev scale , = ( v_+ _ r + i_i ) .",
    "[ vev ] a majoron should emerge from this breaking mechanism , but it turns out to be a safe majoron since it does not couple to the electroweak sector except for the higgs , putting us in a comfortable situation to not worry about its presence in the spectrum . then , from eq .",
    "( [ lagr ] ) , we get a majorana neutrino mass that can range from tens of gev to hundreds of gev , m_n = _1 v_. [ neutmass ] issues concerning light neutrino masses can be addressed by different approaches developed in refs.@xcite , which seem to be particularly interesting to embed our model .",
    "we noticed that our right - handed neutrino has exactly the couplings with a neutral singlet scalar and/or the charged singlet scalar in their models .",
    "the models in refs .",
    "@xcite have already proposed that there is a stable sterile neutrino in their spectra , although they did not deeply surveyed this possibility as we are going to do here . in the case of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite , that we can recover when @xmath21 decouples , the authors had a limitation that their neutrino does not give a sign in direct detection experiments . also , for the case where the charged scalar is almost degenerate in mass with the neutrino , it is fair to mention that coannihilation plays an important role , changing a little their quantitative results , though it do not really change their qualitative aspects . as for the case of the model in ref .",
    "@xcite , a complete analysis of abundance and direct detection is lacking .",
    "even if we can not directly compare our results , it remains as a good reference point for the structure of our model , since our neutrino is much like their third neutrino , it can be a plausible dm candidate , a wimp .",
    "in fact , our proposed charged current involves a sterile neutrino and the electron , instead of a heavier lepton .",
    "we could impose a coupling to a heavier charged lepton , muon or tau , but we not expect big quantitative differences concerning these alternative choices though , and will stick with the coupling with electron only , recovering the main aspects of their dm sector when @xmath8 decouples . in what concerns the 3 - 3 - 1 model  @xcite ,",
    "the possibility of a sterile neutrino as dm candidate is still under study and again we have no direct way to contrast results .",
    "considering the limits imposed by lep on the direct production of such heavy neutrino and the charged scalar bilepton , we can consider the sterile neutrino mass , a majorana one , above 46  gev , and the charged scalar mass above @xmath22  gev  @xcite . in this model",
    "the yukawa couplings can be naturally of order one , and we will explore this fact also imposing that the higgs boson mass be above the experimental limit @xmath23  gev  @xcite and less than @xmath24  gev",
    ".      the scalar masses can be obtained by diagonalizing the mass matrix coming from the new terms in the potential eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) and the higgs potential in sm .",
    "we take the basis for the real part of neutral scalars , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , resulting in the following mass matrix : m^2 = (    cc _v_^2 & v_v _",

    "[ minimum ] as for the pseudoscalars , those coming from the higgs doublet play the same role as before , providing the usual goldstone bosons for the sm , while the new pseudoscalar coming from the singlet neutral scalar , becomes a massless majoron , @xmath27 , which does not couple to the electroweak sector except through the standard higgs boson .",
    "we keep it massless throughout this work , though it could get a mass from higher order terms or radiative corrections and still be a light particle , not changing our results .",
    "of course it can be a dm candidate too , but a non - thermal one , and we are not going to analyze this possibility here .    the mass matrix , eq .",

    "we will always take this mass value bigger than the sterile neutrino mass in order to guarantee the neutrino stability .",
    "next we analyze the viability of the sterile neutrino as a wimp dm candidate by computing its relic abundance and direct detection signals .",
    "based on the discussion in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , the neutral stable particle of this model which plays the role of a wimp is the heavy singlet majorana neutrino , the sterile neutrino .",
    "its stability is guaranteed by a discrete symmetry ( the @xmath29 symmetry mentioned above ) which avoids its coupling to left handed neutrinos , while its mass is less than the new charged singlet scalar .",
    "however , it must reproduce the right relic abundance , @xmath30 , and at the same time it can not conflict with established direct detection experiments  @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the computation of its relic density .",
    "we depart from the assumption that the sterile neutrino was in thermal equilibrium with the sm particles until its decoupling from the thermal bath , the freeze - out epoch .",
    "this thermal equilibrium is possible thanks to the interaction among the sterile neutrino and the electron and also to the higgs boson , through the mixing with the neutral scalar singlet .",
    "since we are talking about a wimp , the freeze - out temperature is reached when it is non - relativistic , meaning that the energy scale to be considered is about @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the sterile neutrino mass .",
    "we can then follow the evolution of the particle number density , @xmath33 , through the boltzmann equation while the universe undergoes its expansion , + 3hn = -<v_r>(n^2-n^2_eq ) , [ boltzmann ] where , @xmath34 is the hubble parameter , which can be written as @xmath35 for a flat universe , @xmath36 is the wimp annihilation cross section thermally averaged with the relative velocity , @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the particle number density at equilibrium . in the expression for the hubble parameter , @xmath39  gev , which is the planck scale and @xmath40 is the energy density of the universe .",
    "since wimps are intrinsically non - relativistic at the time of decoupling ( @xmath41 in our case ) , its equilibrium number density is given by the quantum statistical mechanics expression , n_eq = g_n()^e^- , [ nequilibrium ] where @xmath42 is the number of degrees of freedom of the wimp .",
    "in general , we follow the standard procedure derived in ref .",

    "we have made some quantitative predictions for the relic density of this sterile neutrino in some specific regimes of the model proposed above .",
    "we first compute the relic density for several points in the parameter space , for couplings varying about 0.1 , a neutrino mass between @xmath86  gev and @xmath87  tev , and a range of higgs mass between @xmath88  gev to @xmath89  gev .",
    "we consider two cases , one without coannihilation with @xmath8 and another including the coannihilation .",
    "for the first case we suppose a mass difference between the neutrino and charged scalar of 100  gev . in the second case ,",
    "such a difference is only of order of 10  gev  . in figure",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we show a scatter plot for the relic abundance in terms of the neutrino mass without and with coannihilation .     cl.,title=\"fig : \" ]   cl.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this figure shows that coannihilation is not determinant to have compatible models of sterile neutrinos as a viable dm candidate , but it clearly fills much more of the parameter space than the case without coannihilation .",
    "just as an illustration we also show in figure  [ fig:2 ] the relic abundance when the higgs mass is fixed in two cases , one for @xmath90  gev and the other for @xmath89  gev . in this case",
    "both graphs include coannihilation .",
    "cl.,title=\"fig : \" ]   cl.,title=\"fig : \" ]    there is almost no quantitative difference in the relic abundance concerning the difference in higgs mass within the range @xmath91 .",
    "but as we will see later , these different higgs masses are crucial when we are concerned about direct detection experiments , mainly with respect to cdms - ii recent results  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to consider two limit situations for this model .",
    "one in which the neutral scalar decouples from the spectrum and another one in which the charged scalar is the decoupling particle . the first situation is a peculiar one in the sense that no direct detection experiment is available to test it , since in such a case there is no mediator particle that could connect the wimp with the nuclei .",
    "only accelerator experiments can put a constraint on it , unless a signal is confirmed by current direct detection experiments , which would leave no room for this possibility . on the other hand ,",
    "absence of any direct detection signal would favor such a possibility .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig:3 ] the results for the relic abundance in these situations for higgs mass varying between @xmath92 .",

    "the blue cross represents points for several possible outcomes for the model considered , while the red cross represents those points in parameter space which are in agreement with wmap 5-year run within @xmath84 cl.,title=\"fig : \" ]    from these figures we notice that there is no restriction for the neutrino mass with the appropriate abundance , and the case with no @xmath8 is preferred only if any direct detection signal is claimed , a possibility we are going to treat in section  [ dd ] . in any case , if for some reason , nature chooses a scenario for the realization of this model which is not strictly the one with both , @xmath8 and @xmath21 , in the low energy spectrum , which means that one of them would decouple , it is interesting to check that these two situations do not describe the same physics and hence they are inequivalent and distinguishable .    we have shown that there is a lot of space to accommodate a sterile neutrino ( heavy one ) as a wimp dm candidate in the model discussed here , which poses no undesirable consequences for the electroweak physics since this neutrino does not couple to the electroweak sector .",
    "it is however imperative to look for any bounds coming from direct searches of this wimp and see the implications for the above proposal , which we do next .",
    "it is an exciting time to scrutinize the dark sector of particle physics models . not only because we have much more information about the amount of dm in the universe , but also because many direct detection experiments are improving the precision of cross section for dm scattering with nuclei . in this work we rely upon the most recent experimental results ,",
