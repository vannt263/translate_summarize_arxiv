    "many decades have passed since van hove s theorem @xcite was established regarding the non - existence of a phase transition in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems with short - ranged interactions .",
    "recently , the van hove s theorem has been critically revisited with clarifying the three hypotheses behind this theorem @xcite : homogeneity of particle distribution , no external fields , and the existence of hard - core potential . as a consequence",
    ", the last two limitations have been removed in proving general non - existence theorem @xcite , and yet the first restriction still needs to be imposed on the generalization . in other words , it remains an open theoretical issue as to whether inhomogeneity found in disordered states , such as glassy phase , causes a highly - correlated state that is clearly distinguishable from homogeneous liquid assumed in these theorems .",
    "in contrast , previous experimental and computer simulation results have reported several signatures of the local ordering and/or temporary freezing in dense 1d fluids @xcite .",
    "let us see below the details of the structural and dynamical indications in order to extract any clues to the understanding of relationship among heterogeneity , local ordering , and glassy dynamics .",
    "the emergence of local ordering has been suggested by simulation studies .",
    "on one hand , a latest simulation of the 1d gaussian - core model , a typical soft - core system , has validated that particle clustering actually yields thermodynamic and structural anomalies @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , a set of brownian simulations using various short - ranged interactions has demonstrated that the pronounced first peaks in the static structure factors are equally observed in dense 1d fluids where particles have a critical mobility @xcite .",
    "dynamically , the mean square displacement ( msd ) of a tracer particle signals temporary freezing prior to crystallization at close packing .",
    "the msd has been found to obey the scaling law , @xmath2 , with respect to a time interval @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "recent experimental and simulation studies have verified the crossover change of the msd dependence from normal ( @xmath4 ) to single - file ( @xmath5 ) exponents @xcite with an increase of @xmath3 .",
    "some experiments have also suggested the existence of a third region where the sub - diffusive exponent is further reduced to a long - time asymptote of @xmath6 @xcite , and the diminished exponent of @xmath6 has been reproduced by computer simulations of atomistic models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was reported that initial conditions determine the long time limit of the tagged particle dynamics in an infinite 1d channel @xcite .",
    "figure 1 outlines the above simulation and experimental results in a log - log plot of the msd @xcite .",
    "the green line has three slopes , as delineated in fig .",
    "1 , representing the experimental exponents of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . in fig . 1 , we further compare the third exponent @xmath10 with the final exponents in the long time limit : the maximum exponent , @xmath11 ( red line ) , and the minimum , @xmath12 ( blue line ) .",
    "while the maximum exponent is associated with the goldstone - like diffusion of the 1d chain as a whole @xcite , the 1d particles confined in either a finite box or a harmonic potential will find their equilibrium positions , yielding the almost constant msd ( or the minimum exponent of @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "it is thus seen from fig .",
    "1 that the sub - diffusive exponent approaches @xmath14 @xcite due to the transient existence of a very large but finite box formed by transiently pinned particles , indicating that a tracer particle feels the temporary confinement in advance of recovering the normal exponent ( @xmath15 ) associated with the goldstone - like mode . the suppression of global goldstone - type flows should help constituent particles form a pseudo - crystalline state in a clustered chain , similarly to the confined particles that find their equilibrium positions in the end @xcite : the structural indications , or local ordering , is ascribable to the dynamical signatures , or intermittent diffusion @xcite in the 1d system , as well as in higher dimensional systems @xcite . from the correspondence between statistics and dynamics in dense 1d fluids , we can infer that both of the structural and dynamical signatures found in experiments and simulations @xcite arise from a generic phenomenon to crowded 1d systems unlike artifacts due to finite size effects and an artificial noise source @xcite , which actual systems are likely to involve .    theoretically , the appearance of self - generated pinning by geometrically localized particles is to be explained in terms of collective particle dynamics .",
    "the dynamical density functional theory @xcite , however , has found no signatures of the temporary freezing in the 1d hs system @xcite , other than the dynamical crossover from the single - file diffusion to the goldstone - type dynamics which can be reproduced with the help of the response function method using the frequency spectrum of relaxational dynamics in the 1d hs system @xcite . from thermodynamic aspect ,",
    "the exact free energy of the uniform 1d hs system has also predicted no anomaly without close packing as @xcite ; nevertheless , there exists a variety of theoretical criteria for a crossover phenomenon from the conventional liquid to a pseudo - crystalline state in the 1d hs system @xcite .",
    "consequently , we have a range of volume fraction @xmath16 as the onset densities of a solidlike behavior : @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "first , it is to be noted that a theoretical approach to the formation of high- and low - density 1d clusters has demonstrated the existence of a second maximum for the compressibility of an attractive 1d system at @xmath18 , which is close to the aforementioned lower bound of @xmath16 , and is also consistent with a large interatomic distance in monoatomic au chains experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath16 ( the volume fraction of 0.83 ) is determined by the vanishing residual multi - particle entropy of the 1d hs system @xcite , which also agrees with a jamming density of the square lattice model driven by strong external fields @xcite .",
    "yet the bases of these coincidences are tentative not merely because the decrease of attractive potential strength has been found to smear the extremal compressibility around the lower bound @xcite , but also beacause there remain some controversies over the aforementioned criterion for the upper bound using the residual entropy @xcite .    in the 1d systems characterized by strong density fluctuations ,",
    "temporarily generated clusters have a finite lifetime dependent on the packing density .",
    "it follows that the theoretical treatments of repulsive 1d systems is likely to be hindered from detecting glass - like behaviors .",
    "accordingly , we need to take a fresh look at the inhomogeneous thermodynamics as a primary step toward the dynamical theory that is capable of exploring the emerging condition of intermittent dynamics caused by a global flow pinning .",
    "we address the 1d inhomogeneity , or the local aperiodicity , using the fundamental measure theory ( fmt ) , one of the density functional theories @xcite . the fmt has provided a successful description of the dimensional crossovers when a fluid is localized in a lower dimensionality , including the cases of narrow slits and cylindrical pores .",
    "the 3d free energy that is formulated by the fmt correctly converges to the exact 0d - limiting form , or the free energy of a cavity @xcite . according to the fmt",
    ", the fluid - solid transition in 3d hss is interpreted as one related to dimensional crossover phenomena @xcite .",
    "similarly , we adopt a dimensional crossover approach for determining a precursory volume fraction @xmath1 of crossover from the genuine 1d state to the coexistence of the 1d liquid state and the quasi-0d state ( coarse - grained localization ) , assuming that the quasi-0d state specified below can be defined as a quasi - equilibrium state .",
    "the remainder of this letter is organized as follows : ( i ) first , the delaunay tessellation @xcite of the original system is performed for creating a dual system of 1d hss , which is further coarse - grained using the delaunay cells . through the coarse - graining , the quasi-0d state is naturally introduced as an inactive state .",
    "( ii ) next , we provide a thermodynamic criterion for the quasi-0d state .",
    "( iii ) third , the quasi-0d free energy in the 1d hs system is formulated with the help of fmt .",
    "( iv ) as a result , we obtain the crossover volume fraction @xmath19 , at which the total entropy of the uniform ( or coarse - grained ) 1d hs system vanishes instead of the residual multi - particle entropy .",
    "it is to be noted that the present density of @xmath1 does not only supports the lower bound in the above range of @xmath16 , but is also close to the jamming density @xmath20 in the car parking problem @xcite .",
    "( v ) last , we provide a realistic mapping that is based on the delaunay tessellation of 1d hss .",
    "the delaunay - based mapping relates the one - component hss in continuous 1d space to a 1d lattice model of sites with continuously fluctuating densities , providing a coarse - grained similarity between the quasi-0d state in the hs system and the jammed state in the car parking problem .",
    "to extract the thermodynamics unique to the present freezing , we need to explore a minimal component of hss that blocks the global flows of the 1d fluid .",
    "we adopt the delaunay tessellation of the 1d hs system as a method to create the unit cell because the delaunay cells are determined by two - body correlations between nearest - neighbors , in contrast to the dual cells , the so - called voronoi ones , which are not generated without knowing the three - particle configurations @xcite .",
    "this section consists of two parts : we provide a dual system of the delaunay cells , and define the inactive states as well as voids via coarse - graining .",
    "let @xmath21 be a given number of hss in the 1d system .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows that the @xmath22-th delaunay cell on the right side is constituted by a pair of nearest - neighboring particles which are located , respectively , at @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and is specified by the center position of @xmath26 , the cell size of @xmath27 , and its associated volume fraction : @xmath28 where we have set for brevity that @xmath29 for the diameter @xmath30 of the hss .",
    "the ensemble of delaunay cell centers generates a 1d particle system , which is dual to the original 1d hs system .",
    "when we consider a triplet of original hss in contact with each other , the cell separation @xmath31 between the nearest - neighboring cells becomes equal to the particle diameter , @xmath32 .",
    "correspondingly , the interaction potential @xmath33 between nearest - neighboring cells takes the following form : @xmath34 representing the same interaction as that of original hss .",
    "our focus is on the emerging coexistence in space - time of active and inactive states . the bimodal distribution of the dynamical activity was initially found in a larger variety of the kinetically constrained models of 1d to 3d lattices @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a 3d atomistic model of structural glass - formers obtained numerical evidence of the same type of dynamical coexistence @xcite . according to recent studies on the molecular dynamics simulations of the atomistic models @xcite ,",
    "excited dynamics of active particles is detected using a persistent particle displacement of length @xmath35 . at supercooled conditions , it has been found relevant to take the lower bound of @xmath35 to be of the order of a particle diameter in discriminating active dynamics from inactive states , or self - generated pinning .",
    "previous treatments of the dynamical coexistence thus require a coarse - graining of the particle systems .    in the delaunay cell system generated by the 1d hss",
    ", the inactive state is represented by an elementary process that one particle is blocked by the nearest - neighbor in a delaunay cell , as a minimal unit of the vibrating confinement .",
    "various configurations of the particle pair forming the @xmath22-th delaunay cell is shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , from which it is found that the center position of the inactive cell fluctuates over the scale of maximum gap length @xmath36 : @xmath37 where we have adopted that @xmath38 following the previous treatments .    equations ( [ 0d - gap ] ) and ( [ gap ] ) indicate that where the inactive pinning state of a delaunay cell can be mimicked by one - particle trapping in a quasi-0d cavity with a width of @xmath39 , as shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) where we unite the halves of the constituent hs pair , while holding the cell size at its maximum . equation ( [ gap ] ) also reads that @xmath40 regarding the @xmath22-th cell density @xmath41 and the quasi-0d volume fraction , @xmath42 , which is defined by the lower bound of @xmath41 . in terms of coarse - graining , the inactive state defined by eqs .",
    "( [ 0d - gap ] ) to ( [ 0d - phi ] ) smears particle dynamics inside a quasi-0d box ; therefore , the inactive state is identified with the quasi-0d one .",
    "similarly , it is natural that active state having the condition @xmath43 provides a coarse - grained minimal volume fraction @xmath44 in the range of @xmath45 . for @xmath46",
    ", on the other hand , we set that @xmath47 , because it is plausible to regard this type of delaunay cell as a coarse - grained void , or a bubble , where a particle can be active without involving a cooperative motion @xcite .",
    "before proceeding to the formulation of free energy , we consider a global condition that thermodynamically permits the coexistence between active and inactive particles as a metastable state @xcite during the long - time relaxation from an inhomogeneous liquid with huge clusters to the uniform fluid having the minimum free energy . in the following of this section",
    ", we first introduce the two - state model for specifying these states .",
    "then , we compare the total free energies similarly to the liquid - liquid phase separation phenomena , thereby establishing a global criterion .",
    "we consider the two - state model that simplifies dense 1d systems using the densities as follows ( see also fig .",
    "3 ) : while the active and inactive particles have the 1d and quasi-0d densities , @xmath44 and @xmath42 , respectively , the inhomogeneous fluid consists of a collection of system - wide chains , or huge 1d clusters , with their smeared density of @xmath44 , which necessarily creates empty gaps between the chains with those coarse - grained density @xmath48 set to be @xmath49 . the difference between the coexisting states",
    "is ascribed to the dilute regions which are constituted either by inactive quasi-0d particles having its local density of @xmath50 , or by voids of dynamically irrelevant particles with their actual volume fraction lower than 0.5 .",
    "correspondingly , a small part of the quasi-0d particles confines the fluidic remainder , whereas the existence of voids allows clusters to experience the goldstone - like diffusion .",
    "the uniform density @xmath51 of delaunay cells , which is smeared overall the system , is obtained from averaging these densities , similarly to phase separation systems .",
    "let @xmath52 be a number ratio of the inactive particles to the total , and @xmath53 denote a fraction of voids .",
    "we have @xmath54 with which the two - state model provides the average of the 1d and quasi-0d free energy densities , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath36 represents the gap length between hss ; @xmath57 signifies the free energy density due to a single delaunay cell in the strictly 0d limit of @xmath58 .",
    "we investigate below the stability of quasi-0d states in terms of the relationship between @xmath55 and @xmath56 , presuming that the quasi-0d state is thermodynamically definable @xcite .",
    "the free - energy density @xmath59 of the coexisting state reads @xmath60 similar to the phase - separation free - energy . for comparison , we consider the averaged free - energy density @xmath61 of the above huge clusters , which is expressed as @xmath62 supposing a large scale inhomegeneity based on the two - state model .",
    "comparison of these free energy densities provides a global criterion .",
    "figure 3 corresponds to the schematic representation , illustrating that the self - generated pinning is globally favored instead of maintaining the fluidity due to goldstone - type flows that induces a large scale inhomogeneity .",
    "figure 3 reads that @xmath63 which is fulfilled by the temporary freezing ; however , fluidity should be recovered in the end , because uniform 1d fluid has the minimum free energy : @xmath64 .",
    "the above discussions suggest that we could discriminate the self - generated pinning state in terms of the quasi-0d thermodynamics based on the delaunay cell model .",
    "hence , we formulate the free energy per delaunay cell in the quasi-0d state .      following the fmt , the quasi-0d free energy @xmath65",
    "is given by the same form as the 1d free energy in the unit of thermal energy @xmath66 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 , the ideal part @xmath69 per unit length , is given by @xmath70 , and the excess contribution @xmath71 is expressed as @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "these forms use the localized particle density @xmath73 and its weighted densities , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , given as follows : @xmath76 @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , where we introduced the cavity - occupancy probability @xmath79 in the range of @xmath80 @xcite . in the strict 0d - limit of @xmath81 , the above densities , @xmath82 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , appropriately converge to the strict 0d concentrations , such as @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ cage_density ] ) , implying that the functional change from @xmath84 to @xmath85 expresses a coarse - grained cavity before close packing .",
    "we then calculate the excess part of the free energy @xmath71 following the previous derivation in the fmt @xcite . because the same integral relation , @xmath86 , as in the strict 0d - limit @xcite applies to the quasi-0d form , we are able to integrate @xmath71 , yielding @xmath87 , which is identical to the exact form of the excess 0d free - energy @xcite .    while the ideal free - energy is straightforwardly given by @xmath88 we calculate the excess part of the free energy @xmath89 due to hard core interaction given by eq .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) , following the previous derivation in the fmt @xcite .",

    "( [ start ] ) reads that @xmath91 thus , we obtain the quasi-0d free energy per delaunay cell having a single hs as @xmath92 where use has been made of eq .",
    "( [ density - corr ] ) in the second line . from eq .",
    "( [ 0d - cell - free ] ) , it follows that the quasi-0d free energy density @xmath56 takes the following form @xmath93 where the range ( [ 0d - phi ] ) of @xmath42 is crucial in the following discussions .",
    "let us compare eq .",
    "( [ reduce_free ] ) with the exact 0d free - energy @xcite , @xmath94 where @xmath79 the average occupancy fraction . dividing the exact form @xmath95 into the ideal and excess parts of @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    ", we have @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "these expressions imply the following : the ideal part , @xmath100 , provides no information and the uncertainty of @xmath101 remains in the exact form , though the excess free energy per particle is identical to the thermal energy , such that @xmath102 .",
    "in contrast , our free energy ( [ reduce_free ] ) provides the one - particle free energy of @xmath103 .",
    "the resulting form can be rederived by considering the background 1d system : because the canonical partition function @xmath104 of an @xmath21-particle 1d system is generally defined as @xmath105 , we can immediately validate that @xmath106 due to no interaction energy ( @xmath107 ) in the one - particle system .",
    "the exact free - energy of homogeneous 1d hss is recovered by extending the use of @xmath108 to the invalid range of @xmath109 . in this case , the integration range with respect to @xmath110 must be changed from @xmath111 to @xmath112 , due to the cage - size dependence of weighted density , such as @xmath113 .",
    "accordingly , we obtain the excess free energy , @xmath114 , which is inconsistent with the 0d form of @xmath115 and vanishes in the limit of @xmath116 .    thus , eq . ( [ start ] ) leads to @xmath117 , and we obtain the following forms of the 1d free - energy @xmath118 per cell , the 1d free energy density @xmath119 in the 1d hs fluid , from relating the gap length @xmath36 to the smeared density @xmath44 as @xmath120 @xcite : @xmath121 where the free energy density @xmath55 in the unit of thermal energy @xmath66 has been related to the total entropy density @xmath122 as @xmath123 because the free energy density @xmath55 of the hs system is determined only by the entropic contribution .",
    "it is found from comparing the slopes of the two broken lines in fig .",
    "4 that eq . ( [ cross - necessary ] ) reads the following inequality : @xmath124 equation ( [ slope ] ) is further reduced to @xmath125 which provides the global condition for realizing fig .",
    "3 , or eq . ( [ cross - necessary ] ) : @xmath126 because the mean density @xmath51 is close to @xmath44 in the case of tiny fractions of both quasi-0d particles and voids ( @xmath127 in eq .",
    "( [ mean ] ) ) , eq .",
    "( [ fai1 ] ) implies that a crossover phenomenon occurs at @xmath128 which is to be compared with the jammed density @xmath20 in the car parking lot problem @xcite .",
    "we predict that the quasi-0d particles , emergent as a nucleation in the 1d hs fluid above @xmath1 , interrupt the goldstone - like mode , or the cooperative diffusion of a system - wide string of 1d hss , which causes intermittency ( or a diminished exponent of @xmath6 in terms of the msd ) followed by single - file diffusion .",
    "it is to be noted that we have @xmath129 verifying the above statement that the total entropy vanishes at @xmath1 . in terms of the cell free energy , on the other hand , eq .",

    "5 . equation ( [ constraint ] ) states that the gap length between neighboring hss is less than the hs diameter .",
    "it follows that the site number of the delaunay - based lattice model is equal to the number @xmath21 of constituent particles and is an invariant .    in the quasi-0d state defined by eqs .",
    "( [ 0d - gap ] ) and ( [ gap ] ) , the kinetic constraint ( [ constraint ] ) is not only naturally satisfied , but the lattice number is also identical to the cell species ( @xmath147 ) , which is similar to the jammed state in the car parking model of random sequential adsorption @xcite .",
    "the difference follows : vibrational motions in the hs system keep @xmath41 to be a variable even in the quasi-0d state , whereas each lattice density , in a jammed configuration of parked cars , takes a fixed value due to the quenched position ; therefore , the quasi-0d hss in the 1d system provide realizable configurations of jammed states in the car parking problem , as clarified by the present lattice mapping .",
    "we obtained the analytical form of quasi-0d free energy supposing that coarse - grained localization is thermodynamically discriminable from the 1d hs fluid .",
    "the difference between the 1d and quasi-0d free energy forms enables one to provide a thermodynamic criterion for coexistence of 1d and quasi-0d states analogously to the phase separation condition , thereby predicting that a crossover phenomenon due to the emergence of quasi-0d state occurs at @xmath0 ( or vanishing total entropy of the uniform 1d system ) .",
    "it is to be noted that the present result of @xmath1 is within the previous density range ( @xmath148 ) which was interpreted as an indicator of solidlike ordering @xcite ; in this context , our treatment has revealed the underlying physics above @xmath1 , or the lower bound of @xmath16 , that the existence of a tiny fraction of self - pinned particles in the quasi-0d state is thermodynamically favored , rather than the long - standing fluidity that allows the goldstone - like diffusions of huge clusters .",
    "since the quasi-0d state permits the vibrational motions within the amplitude of hs diameter , the temporary coexistence of active ( 1d ) and inactive ( quasi-0d ) states , or the associated slow dynamics including the intermittency @xcite , should become more obvious in a coarse - grained system , or a 1d lattice model . as an example",
