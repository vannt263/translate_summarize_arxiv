    "the terms ` early ' and ` late type ' in astrophysics have been applied to both stars and galaxies .",
    "spectral classification of stars follows an early - to - late sequence o - b - a - f - g - k - m with recent additions of l - t @xcite .",
    "this classification closely relates to a sequence in temperature from hot to cool stars .",
    "morphological classification of galaxies is based on a number of factors , including ellipticity , the size of the nuclear region relative to the spiral arms , and the smoothness of the image .",
    "a commonly used classification is the revised and extended hubble system @xcite that is based on hubble s ( @xcite ) original scheme for ` extragalactic nebulae ' , and reynold s ( @xcite ) earlier ideas .",
    "it follows an early - to - late sequence , ellipticals - lenticulars - spirals - irregulars , e - s0-sa - sb - sc - sd - sm - im ( ignoring the barred / unbarred characteristic ) .",
    "@xcite has reviewed the history of this development .    at first glance",
    ", there appears to be no relation between the early to late type sequences of stars and galaxies other than the terminology .",
    "before the implications of @xmath0 @xcite were realised , and to explain the hertzsprung - russell diagram , it was natural to suppose that stars cooled from early to late spectral types because there was no established mechanism for myr stability of stellar atmospheres ( cf .",
    "cooling of brown dwarfs , @xcite ) .",
    "there is now a wide - spread but mistaken belief that hubble chose this terminology because he thought that the morphological sequence was also a temporal sequence .",
    "for example , @xcite wrote `` hubble suggested that galaxies evolved from the left - hand end of this sequence to the right .",
    "this now discredited speculation lives on in the convention ... early - type ... late - type galaxies . ''",
    "while , @xcite noted `` although it is now not thought this evolutionary sequence is correct , hubble s nomenclature , in which ellipticals are ` early ' type and spirals and irregulars ` late ' , is still commonly used . ''",
    "similar explanations can be found in other textbooks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the main aim of this article is to show that these explanations for the origin of the terminology are incorrect , and to illuminate the correct explanation .",
    "the temporal meanings of ` early ' and ` late ' were questioned for stellar spectra by the early 1920 s because of , for example , the discovery of red giants and the suggestion of a nuclear timescale by @xcite .",
    "@xcite quotes a 1922 international astronomical union report `` the terms ... are very convenient .",
    "it is well , however , to emphasize that they denote positions early or late in the spectral sequence ... without any necessary connection whatever with an early or late stage of physical evolution . ''",
    "responding to a suggestion that the terms be dropped by @xcite , presciently @xcite said `` it may be doubtful whether words so strongly entrenched in the literature of the subject can now be displaced ... '' in fact they have not been .    in hubble s 1926 paper on the morphological sequence of galaxies",
    "the footnote on page  326 is revealing : `` early and late , in spite of their temporal connotations , appear to be the most convenient adjectives for describing relative positions in the sequence .",
    "... they can be assumed to express a progression from simple to complex forms .",
    "an accepted precedent for this usage is found in the series of stellar spectral types .",
    "there also the progression is ... from the simple to the complex ... the temporal connotations ... have been deliberately disregarded . ''",
    "furthermore , @xcite noted `` the nomenclature , it is emphasized refers to position in the sequence , and temporal connotations are made at one s peril .",
    "the entire classification is purely empirical and without prejudice to theories of evolution ... ''                by the early 1920 s the temporal connotations of ` early ' and ` late ' had been largely disregarded for stellar spectra .",
    "hubble knew this and used the terminology choosing the direction of the morphological sequence based on the apparent complexity as per stellar spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectral - types ] shows spectra of eight stars put in order of their spectral classification , and figure  [ fig : morphology ] shows colour images of eight galaxies put in order of their morphological classification . from these figures , we can immediately see the unification of the terminology such that , in general , earlier types are simpler in appearance and later types are more complex in appearance for both stellar spectra and galaxy images .",
    "( it is worth bearing in mind that both these phenomena would have been observed on black - and - white photographic plates in the 1920 s , and not intensity versus wavelength for spectra , or composite multi - band images . )",
    "while this definition is subjective , it is a coherent starting point for explaining these terms in astrophysics courses ; and it is related to physical phenomena , for example , dependence of absorption transitions on atmospheric temperature in stars , and star - formation triggering in galaxies .",
    "the history of science is simplified in science textbooks because their primary aim is `` persuasive and pedagogic '' @xcite . yet",
    "the particular inaccuracy discussed in this paper , while minor , does a disservice to hubble and observational astronomy , and provides no clarification . by the early 20th century , astronomy was a mature science , and in the mid-1920 s the concept of ` extragalactic ' had only recently been largely accepted .",
    "hubble s 1926 paper is the first to use this term in a published title .",
    "therefore , for hubble to preempt a theory of ` galaxy evolution ' by suggesting that galaxies evolved along the sequence is an historian s fallacy .",
    "hubble was a careful observational astronomer and it is quite clear from his 1926 and 1927 papers , quoted above , that he assumed the temporal implications of ` early ' and ` late ' had been dropped prior to his usage of them .",
    "i postulate that he would not have presumed to establish a theory of galaxy evolution at this stage . even in his more comprehensive book published a decade later @xcite , he was strictly neutral with regard to evolution .",
    "he , however , was influenced by jeans development of liquid rotating spheroids and did earlier hint at evolution based on jeans dynamics , even as he insisted that his classification was strictly based on morphology with no interjections about origins @xcite .    why not have used the terms ` simple ' and ` complex ' ?",
    "these would have preempted theory .",
    "in fact , many morphologically classified early - type galaxies have been shown to have complicated internal dynamics such as kinematically decoupled cores @xcite .",
    "the terms ` simple in appearance ' and ` complex in appearance ' are clunky in comparison with ` early ' and ` late ' , and it should be noted that the complexity of appearance is a guide to the order of the sequence not the definition . in the case of stellar spectra ,",
    "the order is generally quantified by the strengths of various absorption bands . for morphological classification of galaxies , there is no consensus on the most useful quantification . @xcite considered the sequence as a `` progression in dispersion or expansion '' of spiral arms .",
    "there are many alternative strategies for galaxy classification @xcite but hubble s scheme remains part of commonly used systems today .    in summary , when introducing the terms ` early ' and ` late ' for the morphological classification of galaxies , the historical context is explained incorrectly in many texts .",
    "i have shown that the logical reason relates to the complexity of appearance within the sequence .",
    "this reason should improve a student s grasp of why these , apparently arbitrary , terms are used for both stars and galaxies . rather than abandoning the terms",
    ", i propose that hubble s intention be kept in mind when using them since the temporal connotations should by now be well and truly dispelled .",
    "many thanks to allan sandage for suggestions and corrections . thanks to meghmala choudhury and robin mclean for checking references",
    ", phil james for suggesting i write this paper , and nancy medley , sue percival and john stott for comments .",
    "the sao / nasa astrophysics data system was used for historical research , and sdss visual tools was used for extracting the galaxy images ."
