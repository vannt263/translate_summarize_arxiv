    "the quantum processing of information has caused great impact from the standpoint of its potential uses , to the point of being considered a ` second quantum revolution ' @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of these technologies is their capability of encrypting information with extreme security , avoiding the interception of communications between two remote points @xcite .",
    "another advantage is the possibility of achieving quantum computation , which exploits the interference principle and the existence of non - local correlations between interacting quantum objects , which have become fundamental physical resources in the development of quantum information protocols .",
    "this would allow a quantum computer to carry out tasks that are intractable for a classical computer ( e.g. the factorization of a large prime number @xcite or the evaluation of a whole domain of a function in a single computational step @xcite ) ; nevertheless , the experimental challenge implied by the construction of this kind of devices stems from the difficulty of _ locally _ controlling the quantum dynamics of the quantum bits ( qubits ) and the decoherence caused by the interactions with the environment @xcite .",
    "a qubit is a quantum system in which the boolean states ( classical bits ) @xmath2 and @xmath3 are represented by a pair of orthonormal quantum states identified as @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; the two states form a computational base , and any other state of the qubit can be written as a superposition @xmath6 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 complex numbers in general , such that @xmath9 .",
    "physically , a qubit can be a microscopic system like an atom @xcite , a nuclear spin @xcite , a polarized photon @xcite , or more complex structures like quantum dots @xcite , molecular arrays @xcite , and photosynthetic biomolecular systems @xcite , among many others .",
    "quantum dots are advantageous due to the existing industry for their nanofabrication and the ease of incorporating them into current opto - electronic devices @xcite ; besides , quantum computation schemes using quantum dots have been reported @xcite .",
    "these quantum dots can be constructed from inorganic or organic semiconductors , the latter being of special interest due to previous studies of such @xcite , where the quantum dots are really organic heterostructures ( block copolymers ) .",
    "they are easier to construct than the inorganic systems , since they do not require expensive pieces of equipment as required for molecular beam epitaxy or metal - organic chemical vapour deposition . in principle , it is possible to construct an unlimited variety of organic heterostructures , since the interface between the materials is a chemical carbon - carbon bond , in contrast to inorganic ones , where it is required that the materials exhibit similar lattice constants to avoid interfacial stress @xcite , which notably limits the variety of heterostructures that can be synthesised .    nowadays",
    ", many theoretical schemes for quantum computation in the solid state can be found .",
    "universal quantum computation requires controlling the dynamics of individual qubits and the interactions between them , the latter being the main cause of decoherence ( loss of coherence between quantum superpositions ) due to the introduction of control mechanisms external to the system and the ubiquituous coupling to the environment .",
    "the use of electromagnetic pulses as a control mechanism does not cause severe decoherence , which has motivated the proposal of all - optical quantum computation schemes @xcite .",

    "various control schemes have been proposed to control decoherence , among which the spin - barrier one stands out @xcite , which employs two types of two - level systems in a linear arrangement : one type carries the information ( qubits ) and the other type acts as passive barriers of global control between qubits . in this work",
    "we propose the implementation of a model based on the following architecture @xcite : fig .",
    "1(a ) shows a linear arrangement of qubits ( a species ) and control units ( b species ) which possess a third additional level @xmath16 of electronic energy well off resonance with the levels of the computational qubits ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "1(a ) at work . in it ,",
    "the barrier is prepared in the state @xmath16 by the excitation with an external laser , which precludes the interaction between the lateral qubits @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( fig .",

    "1(c ) ) , and the three systems become entangled under free evolution , which allows the quantum gates to be carried out ( fig .",

    "the laser is applied again in such a way that the state @xmath16 is populated again , restoring the barrier , as shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , where a product state of the qubits has been recovered , now represented as @xmath21 .",
    "in this work , we implement the model illustrated above employing negatively doped @xmath0-conjugated multi - block copolymers @xcite , where the carriers of the physical information are electrons interacting through the coulomb force .",
    "this architecture has the advantage of permitting a strong coupling between qubits , since it is molecular @xcite , interacting weakly with phonons , since it is quasi - linear @xcite , and being scalable . by adjusting the length of the wells and barriers , the nine - block architecture 8 ppp-7 pda-8 ppp-3 pa-7 ( cch acene)-3 pa-8 ppp-7 pda-8 ppp was devised , where ppp , pda , pa and cch acene refer to poly-(_p_-phenylene ) , poly - diacetylene , _",
    "trans_-polyacetylene and poly - acene substituted with ethynyl ( cch ) groups .    according to the envelope molecular orbital theory @xcite , the conduction band of the nine - blocks can be visualised as the multiple well illustrated in fig .",
    "1(e ) , where the mono - electronic levels localised in each well and their energy differences are indicated .",
    "such levels were determined employing the semiempirical extended hckel method @xcite , which includes all the valence electrons and takes into account the overlap between all atomic basis functions .",
    "to visualise compactly the shape of the molecular orbitals in one dimension , a localisation parameter on the @xmath22-th atom is defined as @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 labels the atomic orbitals that enter the expression of the @xmath25-th hckel molecular orbital in terms of a linear combination of atomic orbitals @xmath26 since @xmath27 is the contribution of the @xmath24-th basis ao centered on the @xmath22-th atom to the @xmath25-th mo , @xmath28 provides a measure of the electron density at that site of the molecule . since the value of this parameter is a function of the position along the chain , specified by @xmath22 , the set of @xmath28 reveals the spatial shape of the mo . in figs .",
    "2(a)-(h ) the localisation parameters are shown for the mos of the conduction band of the heterostructure .    as fig .",
    "2 shows , the mos are localised within one of the wells , which justifies the assignment of each eigenstate to a certain spatial region of the molecule , as indicated in fig .",
    "when each of the three wells is doped with an electron , the states @xmath29 and @xmath30 of the lateral wells act as qubits , whereas the state of the central well permits activation and deactivation of the resonant coupling , and therefore the entanglement between them through stimulated optical transitions @xmath31 .",

    "@xmath39 is of the order of @xmath40 .",
    "although there is some small degree of energy mismatch in the designed heterostructure , this can be minimized by refining the quantum - chemistry calculations , and the main source of decoherence would come from electron - phonon coupling effects .",
    "the results obtained indicate that the proposed architecture is a plausible system for the physical implementation of global quantum computation schemes .",
    "it fulfills the requirement of scalability , and , in addition , the control of the dynamics can be carried out using pulses of the order of picoseconds , which would allow the efficient realisation of one and two qubits unitary transformations , the elementary building blocks for performing a conditional quantum dynamics .",
    "the initial estimations made for the heterostructure relaxation rates indicate that the system is not very susceptible to prompt environment - driven decoherence , which is a good indicator that the quantum coherent control proposed in this work is feasible .",
