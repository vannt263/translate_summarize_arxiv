    "wstite , fe@xmath0o , has challenged experimental and theoretical condensed matter physics for over sixty years . in particular , the extent of its nonstoichiometry and its defect structure have been the subject of numerous experimental studies @xcite and are still a matter of discussion and a source of controversy @xcite . generally , these studies indicate that the crystal lattice of feo is modified by the presence of fe@xmath3 cations and vacant fe@xmath4 sites .",
    "the crystal structure and charge distribution in fe@xmath0o are very complex as the defects are likely to coalesce and arrange into clusters , which in turn can aggregate into larger defect structures .",
    "although the size , shape and distribution of the stable equilibrium defect clusters and their aggregates are still controversial , they are expected to vary with pressure , temperature and composition @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the clusters of defects are believed to order magnetically below the nel temperature @xmath5  k.    early theoretical investigations on nonstoichiometric feo were mainly aimed at the mechanism of formation and stability of isolated fe vacancies , prototypical 4:1-type clusters comprised of interstitial ( tetrahedral ) fe@xmath3 ion surrounded by four cation vacancies as well as complexes of such clusters @xcite .",
    "the results of these studies indicate that wstite favors formation of 4:1-type clusters which are major building blocks for further agglomeration and defect cluster growth @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a substantial concentration of free vacancies can also be stabilized within the wstite lattice .",
    "extended defect structures in fe@xmath0o were rarely modeled using the density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "such simulations are still extremely demanding , as they require proper description of the highly correlated nature of 3@xmath6 electrons @xcite and extensive ionic relaxations within large supercells to predict a correct ground state of fe@xmath0o . in our previous work",
    ", the dft investigations have been performed for vacancy - defected feo @xcite , uncovering pronounced changes of the electronic and vibrational properties induced by isolated cation vacancies .",
    "recently , it was shown that polaronic distributions of charge resembling those in magnetite fe@xmath7o@xmath8 emerge for the most stable defect structures in wstite @xcite .",
    "the point defects as well as their clusters are likely to affect the dielectric and optical properties of feo",
    ". the results of various experiments @xcite indicate some peculiar behavior of the measured optical quantities in wstite and assign it to the native defects .",
    "however , a detailed explanation of the influence of such defects on the electronic and dielectric properties of feo remains unclear .",
    "furthermore , sensitivity of both the electronic structure and dielectric functions to the defect states as well as the extent of modifications induced by isolated or cluster defects still remains unexplored .",
    "the present work extends description of wstite by investigating its electronic structure and dielectric properties as functions of the concentration of cation monovacancies and vacancy clusters .",

    "additional calculations with reduced values of @xmath16 , ranging from 2 to 4  ev , were carried out to investigate the influence of strong electron interactions and the screening processes due to defects on both the electronic structure and dielectric functions of wstite .",
    "a variety of experiments performed over decades indicates that feo is always deficient in iron and the concentration of vacancies in the oxygen sublattice is several orders of magnitude smaller than the concentration of iron vacancies @xcite .",
    "following the experimental evidence , we introduced vacancies into the cation sublattice of feo and left its anion sublattice defect - free . the fe@xmath0o structures with vacancy concentrations @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20% were modeled by supercells @xcite .",
    "each initial supercell of fe@xmath0o was derived from the basic 64-atom feo supercell which takes into consideration the antiferromagnetic ( afii ) order @xcite and comprises two ferromagnetic fe - sublattices differing in the orientation of the spin magnetic moments ( spin - up and spin - down fe - sublattices ) .",

    "there is also a correspondence between @xmath38(fe@xmath4 ) in fe@xmath0o and @xmath38 of octahedral fe@xmath4 in fe@xmath7o@xmath8 , since the mssbauer resonance spectra of fe@xmath7o@xmath8 obtained at 4.2  k reveal at least three components arising from the octahedral fe@xmath4 ions , for which the isomer shifts range from 0.81 to 1.02  mm / s @xcite .",
    "the sub - spectra due to the octahedral fe@xmath4 ions results from the lowered symmetry of fe@xmath7o@xmath8 below the verwey transition temperature @xmath39  k. we mention that the room temperature mssbauer spectra of fe@xmath7o@xmath8 show the isomer shift for the octahedral cations of 0.66  mm / s resulting from the electron hopping between the octahedral fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath3 ions .",
    "it is advantageous to compare the calculated and measured isomer shifts of fe cations in fe - doped co@xmath0o which is also a compound from the family of the simple 3@xmath6 transition - metal monoxides , albeit showing much less degree of non - stoichiometry ( 13% ) than wstite .",
    "the high - spin fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath3 ions in co@xmath0o give rise to the mssbauer resonance lines having respectively the isomer shifts of 1.02 and 0.37  mm / s @xcite .",
    "these values remain in close relationship with those measured by the emission mssbauer spectroscopy ( 1.121.14  mm / s for high - spin fe@xmath4 and 0.340.37  mm / s for high - spin fe@xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "the mssbauer spectra of realistic fe@xmath0o samples @xcite show much complexity as they are composed of several components reflecting quite a large number of different local environments accessible for fe cations in the wstite lattice .",
    "although many attempts were undertaken @xcite , none of them described the local defect structure of wstite in detail as the hyperfine parameters of the fe cations deduced from the empirical fits could only provide a rough information on the statistically averaged environment of fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath3 in fe@xmath0o .",
    "thus , the mssbauer spectra of samples with the same stoichiometry could be successfully fitted using quite distinct phenomenological models .",
    "a difficulty in the interpretation of the experimental spectra presumably originates from a strong dependence of the wstite defect structure on stoichiometry and the population of certain defect arrangements in the fe@xmath0o lattice may vary with composition in a complicated manner . although , the present theoretical research considers a limited number of possible defect configurations in wstite , the results collected in table  [ tab2 ] can be useful while interpreting the mssbauer spectra of fe@xmath0o because they provide direct relationship between the local electronic structure of fe cations ( reflected by the respective isomer shifts ) , their location inside the wstite lattice , and their immediate surrounding .",
    "we have calculated the charges of ions using the bader analysis ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) . due to the hybridization effects ,",
    "the obtained charges differ from the ionic valences and the difference between the fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath3 state is approximately 0.3 @xmath40 .",
    "the trivalent cations exhibit enhanced spin magnetic moments comparing to those of divalent ones .",

    "we observe that the energy gap of each fe@xmath0o composition decreases linearly upon decreasing @xmath16 .",
    "particular declines in the band gap energies are characterized by different slopes , i.e. , the lower the @xmath1 the higher the slope . obviously , the structures with higher vacancy concentrations exhibit more reduced energy gaps comparing to that of defect - free feo , mainly due to the increased number of empty fe@xmath3 states induced in the gap . these states are located just below the conduction band dominated by the unoccupied electronic states arising from the fe@xmath4 ions that hybridize with the unoccupied states of oxygen anions ( see fig .",

    "in addition , the zero - frequency limit of @xmath50 corresponds to the electronic part of the static dielectric constant of a material @xmath53 , a parameter being of fundamental importance in many aspects of material properties , whereas @xmath51 is more specific and remains closely related to the band structure of the system .",

    "nevertheless , one can neglect this effect as too tiny to be observed experimentally and consider the averaged values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "figure [ dielfun ] shows that both components of @xmath52 remain sensitive to the vacancy concentration in the regime of low photon energies ( @xmath54  ev ) , while at higher energies the differences between dielectric functions in the systems with different @xmath1 are insignificant .",
    "although @xmath53 increases with increased @xmath1 , the shift upward does not exceed 10% within the studied range of vacancy concentrations .",

    "much higher values of @xmath53 derived from experimental spectra may indicate an existence of large amount of delocalized charge carries in the highly nonstoichiometric samples that can be easily polarized enhancing the value of @xmath53 .",
    "one should also be aware that the static dielectric constant is measured at finite temperature and involves a contribution arising from phonons , whereas the majority of the calculations are actually performed for a static crystal ( zero temperature and neglecting zero - point vibrations ) and hence they report values due to the purely electronic screening .",

    "the @xmath51 spectra clearly show the red shift of the absorption edge and reduction of the optical gap with increasing vacancy concentration .",
    "the decrease of the optical gap from @xmath57 to @xmath58  ev while going from defect - free feo to fe@xmath0o results from a presence of the fe@xmath3 states in the band gap .",
    "a substantial reduction of the band gap in fe@xmath0o with vacancy content ranging from 7 to 8% has been revealed by the recent infrared reflectivity and ellipsometry experiments @xcite .",
    "these studies provide value of the fundamental absorption edge in wstite of 1.15  ev at 5  k and 1.01.3  ev at room temperature .",
    "the absorption spectra of fe@xmath0o with different concentrations of vacancies show many common features .",
    "first of all , the spectra are dominated by a wide and intense peak at 5.2  ev which shifts slightly to lower ( higher ) energies for fe@xmath0o systems containing isolated vacancies ( vacancy clusters ) .",
    "another similarity is connected with the broad and less intense peak at 6.7  ev moving upward by about 1  ev but only in wstite containing vacancy clusters .",
    "generally , both peaks diminish their intensities with the increased defect content . the absorption spectra exhibit broad distribution in the energy range of 1025  ev and structureless plateau declining progressively at still higher photon energies .",
    "there are , however , prominent differences in @xmath51 spectra between systems with isolated vacancies and 4:1-type clusters .",
    "they are encountered mainly below 4.5  ev and reflect differences in the electronic structures between those systems ( cf .",
    "[ edos ] and fig .  1 in ref",

    "the shoulder extending from about 1.5 to 4  ev originates from interband transitions that involve states of fe@xmath3 and fe@xmath4 ions residing in r lattice positions as well as the oxygen states that are always hybridized with cation states .",
    "the respective feature in wstite with vacancy clusters gets better resolved structure with a peak emerging at 4  ev and a tail with small swelling centered just above 2  ev .",
    "the 4  ev peak originates solely from the transitions due to the states of fe@xmath4 ions at the r or i sites , provided the latter are present in the lattice [ cf .",

    "rise to transitions observed at energy in the vicinity of 2  ev .",
    "it is worth to note that the swelling at 2  ev immerses into the broad distribution when fe@xmath3 ions occupy only the r sites .",
    "in such a case the low - energy @xmath51 spectrum of wstite with 4:1-type clusters resembles the @xmath51 spectrum of wstite with isolated vacancies .",
    "therefore , the swelling can be assigned to transitions involving trivalent fe cations at interstitial lattice positions . moreover ,",
    "an exact identification of the transitions that are responsible for the peaks in the @xmath51 spectra of fe@xmath0o is hindered by a strong overlap and hybridization of the @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath6 states in both the valence and conduction bands .",

    "such a strong sensitivity of the infrared spectra to the concentration of defects can account for a large scattering seen in the experimentally determined to phonon frequencies in wstite which cover the range extending from 320 to 410  @xmath73 @xcite . the broadening and shifting of the infrared spectral peaks seem to have the same origin as very similar changes observed in the phonon density of states @xcite and they reflect pronounced modifications of the electronic structure and force constants due to cation vacancies in the fe - sublattice of wstite .",
    "this work investigates the role of strong electron correlations on fe atoms and the high concentration of cation vacancies in modifying the electronic and dielectric properties of wstite ( fe@xmath0o ) .",
    "as we have shown , both of them influence substantially the electronic properties of this compound and have opposite effect on its band structure .",
    "while the local electron interactions in the fe @xmath14 states are responsible for the opening of the insulating gap , the fe vacancies reduce its magnitude .",
    "the mechanism of gap reduction remains the same , irrespectively of the type of incorporated defects .",
    "either monovacancies or vacancy clusters induce the band of empty fe@xmath3 states inside the gap of the perfect feo crystal .",
    "the width of this band increases monotonically with the increased concentration of cation vacancies reducing the distance from the top of valence states , so effectively diminishing the band gap .",
    "the strength of the effective local interaction @xmath76 depends presumably on the vacancy content , i.e. , the band gap reduction enhances the screening of coulomb interactions , which may lead to even larger electron mobility and _ metallization _ of iron oxide .",
    "the presence of free charge carriers , modeled here by small values of @xmath16 , explain the increase of dielectric function and optical reflectivity observed experimentally at low energies .",
    "summarizing , we presented an explanation of several effects observed in the optical properties of wstite and explained them by the presence of defects .",
    "we emphasize that our studies also explain the anomalous broadening of infrared spectra , demonstrating a strong effect of cation vacancies on phonons in wstite .",
    "similar correlations between charge distribution and lattice dynamics induced by the electron - phonon coupling play an important role in the verwey transition in magnetite ( fe@xmath7o@xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "as noticed recently @xcite , also the polaronic distribution found in defected feo resembles the charge - orbital order in magnetite and may share a common origin with the short - range order observed above the verwey temperature @xcite .",
    "finally , we point out that the effects discussed here can be relevant not only for iron oxides but are expected to determine the electronic , dielectric , and dynamical properties of other strongly correlated systems with high concentrations of intrinsic defects as well .",
