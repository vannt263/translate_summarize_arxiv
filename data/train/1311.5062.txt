    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are among the most luminous explosions in the observed universe @xcite .",
    "the cosmological precision distance measurements enabled by sne ia first revealed the accelerating expansion of the universe ( @xcite ) .",
    "general consensus holds that sne ia arise from the thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( co wds ) in close binaries ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mainstream progenitor models of sne ia can be categorized as the single - degenerate ( sd ) and the double - degenerate ( dd ) scenarios ( for reviews , see @xcite ) . in the sd scenario ,",
    "a co wd accretes hydrogen / helium - rich material from its stellar companion until its mass approaches the chandrasekhar mass @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the dd scenario involves two wds in a close binary , and the merger of the two wds , which have a combined mass larger than or equal to @xmath1 , may result in the explosion as a sn ia @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggest that during the final stages of the common envelope ( ce ) evolution a merger of a wd with the core of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) or the red giant branch ( rgb ) star may trigger a sn ia , which is termed as the core - degenerate scenario .",
    "observational and theoretical evidence exists both for and against each of the progenitor scenarios . at present",
    "it is unclear whether one of these possibilities is exclusively realized in nature or whether all contribute to sne ia ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this work we focus on the sd scenario , which is observationally manifested by the supersoft x - ray sources ( ssss ) . in these sources a wd",
    "is thought to be accreting rapidly from its binary companion @xcite .",
    "@xcite explained the observed characteristics of ssss with steady nuclear burning of hydrogen on the wds . in this model",
    ", mass is transferred from a main - sequence ( ms ) or ( sub)giant donor star on a thermal or nuclear timescale by roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) . for steady hydrogen burning",
    "the accretion rate should be @xmath2 for a @xmath3 wd .",
    "binary evolutionary calculations show that the donor star is either a ms star more massive than the wd ( with mass @xmath4 ) , or a low - mass ( @xmath5 ) ( sub)giant star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to ensure that the mass transfer rate is high enough for steady burning .",
    "a number of observational results have been used to constrain the sn ia progenitor models , including the surviving companion stars of sne ia , the signatures of gas outflows from the sne ia progenitor systems , the early multi - wavelength emission of sne ia , the stripped mass of the companions due to sn explosions , etc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "in particular the delay time distribution ( dtd ) of sne ia presents a useful tool to probe the progenitor scenarios . from studies using various sn samples , environments , and redshift ranges , a best fit power - law form",
    "@xmath6 has been derived , in which a similar dtd with prompt ( a few @xmath7 yr ) , delayed , and intermediate ( a few gyr ) components was recovered ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "this requires that in the sd scenario the donor mass should be in the range of @xmath8 to @xmath9 , considerably wider than predicted by the aforementioned investigations .",
    "however , it is well known that when the donor mass is more massive than @xmath10 the mass transfer is dynamically unstable and a ce stage must follow . moreover",
    ", the observational properties of some ssss ( e.g. , rx j0439.8@xmath116809 , 1e0035.4@xmath117230 , rx j0537.7@xmath117034 and cal 87 ) do not fit in the classical picture of ssss as being driven by thermal timescale mass transfer .",
    "for example , the high luminosity ( @xmath12 ergs@xmath13 ) and low temperature ( @xmath14 k ) measured in 1e0035.4@xmath117230 establish that it is a supersoft binary which has a wd with stable nuclear burning .",
    "however , the orbital period of 4.126 hr @xcite is significantly shorter than that required for a binary with thermal - timescale mass transfer , and implies a mass ratio @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the masses of the wd and the donor respectively ) @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the prototype sss cal 87 has a wd of mass @xmath18 @xcite in a 10.6 hr orbit @xcite .",
    "the donor masses and orbital periods in these systems are in contradiction with the standard picture of ssss .    to resolve the above inconsistencies , a wind - driven evolution of ssss was proposed in the literature .",
    "there are two kinds of such models in which the  wind \" has different meaning and operates in different ways . in relatively low - mass systems ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that the companion star can be irradiated by the soft x - rays from the sss , exciting strong winds , which drive rlof at a high rate and sustain steady hydrogen burning on the accreting wd .",
    "for relatively massive systems , @xcite propose that the optically thick winds from the accreting wd can collide with the companion and strip off its surface layer .",
    "this mass - stripping attenuates the mass transfer rate , thus preventing the formation of a ce .",
    "@xcite showed that the predicted dtd from @xmath19 gyr is in agreement with the recent measurements .",
    "it is noted that in their studies , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite used a semi - analytical method or semi - empirical input to investigate the evolution of the wd binaries . in this paper",
    "we present detailed numerical calculations of the mass transfer processes in the wd binaries including the wind effect . in section 2",
    "we introduce the two kinds of wind - driven models .",
    "the calculated results are presented in section 3 and compared with observations in section 4 .",
    "discussion and conclusions are in section 5 .",
    "we calculate the evolution of a binary consisting of a wd and a ms companion star with an updated version of eggleton s stellar evolution code @xcite .",
    "we take into account the self - excited winds from the donor due to the irradiation from the wd @xcite ( termed as case 1 ) , the mass - stripping from the donor due to the wd s wind @xcite ( termed as case 2 ) , and the response of the donor due to the related mass loss processes . beside angular momentum losses due to the winds or the stripped material , angular momentum loss caused by gravitational wave radiation @xcite and magnetic braking @xcite",
    "is also considered .",
    "below we introduce the self - excited wind model and the mass - stripping model .",
    "@xcite argue that irradiation in perhaps all ssss may lead to a strong stellar wind from the heated side of the donor star . if escaping the binary with the specific angular momentum of the donor , the wind will drive mass transfer with a rate which is of the same order as the wind loss rate .",
    "the relation between the mass transfer rate @xmath20 and the wind loss rate @xmath21 obeys @xmath22 for @xmath23 ; and @xmath24 for @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 measures the efficiency of the wd s spectrum in producing ionizing photons normalized to the case of supersoft x - ray temperatures of a few times @xmath28 k , @xmath29 measures the luminosity per gram of matter accreted relative to the value for hydrogen shell burning , and @xmath30 is an efficiency factor parameterizing the fraction of the companion s irradiated face , and the fraction of the wind mass escaping the system ( for the details , see * ? ? ?",
    "stability analysis shows that , for ssss with a low mass ratio ( @xmath31 ) , the resulting mass transfer is stable and with a rate sufficient to keep the binary in the stable ( steady or recurrent ) hydrogen burning regime ; for wd binaries with large mass ratios ( @xmath32 ) , the self - excited winds can stabilize mass transfer at a threshold value ( @xmath33yr@xmath13 ) for nonexplosive nuclear burning of the accreted matter @xcite .      @xcite introduce the mass - stripping effect on a ms or slightly evolved companion star by the winds from an accreting wd . since the companion star is initially more massive than the wd , mass transfer proceeds on a thermal timescale .",
    "if the mass transfer rate exceeds the critical rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath34 there is optically thick wind to blow from the wd @xcite .",
    "the fast - moving wind collides with the companion star and strips off its surface layer by the shock dissipated into it @xcite .",
    "the stripping rate is estimated to be @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a numerical factor determined by the binary separation and the masses of both components with its value ranging @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the wind loss rate from the wd .",
    "the stripped mass is assumed to leave the binary from the @xmath39 point , carrying away the corresponding specific angular momentum .",
    "since this mass - stripping quickly decreases the mass of the donor star , it can attenuate the mass transfer rate , thus preventing the formation of a ce . in this way",
    ", young and massive companion stars can drive the wds to the sn ia explosions .",
    "the growth rate of the wd in mass as a result of the accretion is determined by the accumulation efficiencies of hydrogen and helium burning , @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the fraction of transferred hydrogen and helium - rich matter from the companion that eventually burns into helium and carbon - rich matter and stays on the wd , respectively . here",
    "we fit the numerical results of @xcite and @xcite for the hydrogen mass accumulation efficiency @xmath41 , and adopt the prescriptions in @xcite for the helium mass accumulation efficiency @xmath42 .",
    "we have calculated the evolutions of a grid of binaries with wds of initial mass @xmath43 and ms companion stars of initial mass @xmath44 with solar abundance in cases 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of the initial companion s mass @xmath45 versus the initial orbital period @xmath46 in which the binaries can evolve to sne ia in case 1 .",
    "the black , red , and blue solid lines correspond to the initial wd mass of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "the dashed lines show the results with the same wd mass but without self - excited winds considered , as calculated by @xcite . in the latter case the mass transfer is driven only by the nuclear evolution of the companion star . to acquire a sufficiently high mass transfer rate the companion star should be more massive than @xmath50 .",
    "when the self - excited wind from the companion star is included , the companion star s mass can extend down to @xmath51 . since the wind can cause the orbit to shrink and accelerate the mass transfer , the mass transfer can maintain a rate high enough for stable burning , even if @xmath17 is not larger than @xmath16 .",
    "however , this effect also lowers the upper limit of the companion s mass and narrows the initial orbital period to some extent , because the mass transfer becomes dynamically unstable if @xmath45 or @xmath46 is larger .",
    "the initial @xmath45 vs. @xmath46 distributions in case 2 ( with @xmath52 ) are shown in figure 2a .",
    "figure 2b shows the same distribution but with fixed @xmath53 and different values of @xmath36 ( the  no - wind \" result is also presented ) .",
    "compared with @xcite , there are similar features such as , the allowed range of the companion star s mass is larger for bigger @xmath36 .",
    "however , the parameter spaces in figure 2 is somewhat smaller than in @xcite , because in @xcite the boundaries of the sn ia region in the @xmath54 plane are set by the following simplified conditions : ( 1 ) the left boundary is given by the mass - radius relation for the zero - age ms stars ; ( 2 ) the lower boundary is set by the occurrence of strong nova explosions , when @xmath55 yr@xmath13 ; ( 3 ) the upper boundary is set by the formation of a ce with the assumption of @xmath56 yr@xmath13 ; and ( 4 ) the right boundary corresponds to the end of central hydrogen burning of the ms companion .",
    "additionally , @xcite use a semi - analytical approximation to estimate the thermal - timescale mass transfer rate . in our calculations , although the mass - stripping can result in a lower mass transfer rate ( compared with the no - stripping case ) , the system still has a too high mass transfer rate and evolves into the ce phase if the companion star s mass @xmath57 . for lower - mass companion stars ( @xmath58 ) the mass transfer is not fast enough to drive the wd to the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "comparison of figures 1 and 2 shows that the sn ia regions in case 2 are larger than in case 1 , but the lower limits of @xmath45 are not as low as in case 1 .",
    "although both the irradiation and the wind from the wd can trigger mass loss from the companion star , their influence on the orbital evolution and hence the mass transfer is different .",
    "we find that angular momentum loss and mass loss dominate the evolution in cases 1 and 2 respectively , so that the mass transfer rates for low / high - mass companion stars are higher / lower in case 1 than in case 2 .",
    "therefore , in general , the mass - stripping effect favors more massive companion stars to drive the wds to sn ia explosions , while the self - excited wind is preferred for lower - mass companion stars .",
    "figure 3 compares the distributions of the companion mass @xmath59 and the orbital period @xmath60 when the wd reaches @xmath61 in cases 1 ( left ) and 2 ( right ) . while the orbital periods are distributed similarly , e.g. , between @xmath62 day and @xmath63 days for @xmath64 , the masses of the companion stars in case 1 range from @xmath65 to @xmath66 , significantly smaller than in case 2 ( @xmath67 ) . in both cases",
    "lower - mass companion stars are more likely to be in wider orbits because of longer mass transfer time .    in figures 4 - 6",
    "we show the distributions of the companion s rotating velocity vs. the stellar radius , the surface gravity vs. the orbital velocity , and the effective temperature vs. the absolute magnitude when the wd mass reaches @xmath68 in cases 1 ( left ) and 2 ( right ) , respectively .",
    "together with figure 3 , they present useful probes to test the proposed sd scenarios by comparison with observational constraints ( cf .",
    "the tycho s supernova ( sn 1572 ) is close enough to search for the widowed companion to the exploded wd , should it exist .",
    "@xcite surveyed the central region of sn 1572 s remnant , and proposed that the star g appears to be the surviving companion of the sn .",
    "this star is similar to our sun in surface temperature ( @xmath69 k ) but with higher space velocity of @xmath70 kms@xmath13 and lower surface gravity ( @xmath71 kms@xmath72 ) .",
    "these values are within the allowed regions presented in figures 5 and 6 . however",
    ", more recent observations indicate that this identification remains controversial @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the extensive historical imaging obtained at the location of sn 2011fe / ptf11kly , the closest sn ia discovered in the digital imaging era , to constrain the visible - light luminosity of the progenitor to be @xmath73 times fainter than previous limits on other sne ia progenitors .",
    "they proposed that the exploding wd accreted matter either from another wd , or by rlof from a subgiant or ms companion star .",
    "@xcite searched for the ex - companion star in snr 0519@xmath1169.0 , located in the large magellanic cloud , based on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) images with a limiting magnitude of @xmath74 .",
    "they found that one of the 27 ms stars brighter than @xmath75 ( corresponds to @xmath76 ) within @xmath77 of the position could be the ex - companion star left over from a sss progenitor , ruling out sd models with post - ms stars .",
    "@xcite spectroscopically scrutinized 24 of the brightest stars residing in the central @xmath78 of the sn 1604 ( kepler ) sn remnant to search for a possible surviving companion star , and ruled out donor star down to @xmath79 .",
    "@xcite searched for the surviving companions of the progenitor of sn1006 , and found that none of the stars within @xmath80 of the apparent site of the explosion is associated with the sn remnant down to the limit @xmath81 , thus exclude all giant and subgiant companions to the progenitor .",
    "so sn 1006 should have been produced either by mass accretion from an unevolved star , similar to , or less massive than the sun , or by merging with another wd .",
    "@xcite also scrutinized the central stars ( 79 in total ) of the sn 1006 remnant to search for the surviving donor star .",
    "the rotational velocities of these stars are estimated to be around 10 kms@xmath13 .",
    "the aforementioned observational constraints on the possible surviving companions deviate significantly from expected in the traditional sd models , but are ( in some cases barely ) consistent with the results in the self - excited wind model ( case 1 ) shown in figures 4 - 6 .    from the hst deep images of snr 0509@xmath1167.5 in the large magellanic cloud",
    ", @xcite reported that the maximal central error circle is empty of point sources to the limit of @xmath82 , which corresponds to @xmath83 .",
    "this is outside our predicted region even in the most optimistic situation .",
    "however , as discussed below , lower - mass companion stars are expected , if other effects such as the wd s magnetic field are taken into account .      another useful feature of the sn ia progenitors is the dtd .",
    "the dtd is the hypothetical sn rate versus time that would follow a brief burst of star formation , and the delay times are defined as the time interval between the star formation and the sn explosion .",
    "the sn ia dtds are directly linked to the lifetimes of the wd s progenitor and the companion star , and the binary separation .",
    "various kinds of the progenitor models of sne ia can be examined by comparing their dtds with observations .",
    "similar as in @xcite , the dtd of sne ia from the wind - driven systems is estimated by integrating the initial sets of @xmath84 ( where @xmath85 is the binary separation ) having the delay time between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 assuming @xmath89 we show the calculated dtds of the two wind - driven models in figure 7 ( the sn rate has been normalized to be @xmath90 yr@xmath13 ) . also plotted in the solid line is the fitted form for the dtds from current observations @xcite , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the delay time .",
    "figure [ fig : hdtd ] shows that the calculated results in both cases are in agreement of eq .",
    "( 7 ) , and those in case 1 are generally longer than case 2 , because of the lower donor mass .",
    "if both models work , the dtds can extend from a few @xmath7 yr to @xmath93 gyr .",
    "in the standard picture of the sd scenario for sne ia , a wd accretes at a rate @xmath94yr@xmath13 from its companion star which is required to power steady hydrogen burning .",
    "the fast accretion onto the wd is driven by the roche lobe shrinking ( or increase ) faster ( or more slowly ) than the companion star , and requires a mass ratio of @xmath95 , that is , the companion stars to @xmath68 wds must be either ms stars or ( sub)giants with mass @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "on the hand , the companion s mass must be @xmath97 to guarantee that the mass transfer is dynamically stable @xcite .",
    "this value is obtained under the assumption that there are strong winds from the wd if the accretion rate is higher than the upper limit of the accretion rate for stable hydrogen burning @xcite .",
    "the properties of the surviving stars after the sn ia explosions can thus been investigated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , observations of sne ia and ssss , especially the derived dtds of sne ia , the existence of 1e 0035.4@xmath117230-like sources , and the constraints on the surviving companion stars for several nearby sne ia , strongly suggest that the initial masses of the companion stars should occupy a wider range than thought before",
    ". further revisions on the sd scenarios consider the effects of irradiation the soft x - rays from the wd on the companion star @xcite , a possible circumbinary disk around the wd binary @xcite , the mass - stripping of the companion star by the wd s wind @xcite , and the thermal instability in the accretion disk @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the evolution of wd / ms star binaries based on the self - excited wind model @xcite and the mass - stripping model @xcite to produce sne ia . in these models , x - ray radiation or the wind from the accreting wd strongly affects the structure of the companion s envelope , causing winds or mass loss from the donor star .",
    "this wind - driven evolution can stabilize the mass transfer when the companion is considerably more massive than the wd , thus avoiding the ce evolution , or enhance the mass transfer rate when the companion is less massive than the wd .",
    "it is shown that the predicted properties of the companion stars are more compatible with recent observational constraints for several sne ia which have been investigated in detail than in the traditional sd scenario .",
    "we caution that several issues in the wind - driven evolution models need to be addressed .",
    "it is unclear whether the self - excited wind and the mass - stripping work jointly or independently .",
    "the stability and efficiency of the mass transfer under these circumstances depend on the parameters @xmath98 , @xmath30 and @xmath36 , which are related to the efficiency of x - ray irradiation , the wd s wind velocity , and the structure of the companion star , all poorly known .",
    "furthermore , the conditions for the wind - driven evolution are not well understood , although they are theoretically permitted .",
    "for example , most of the known wd binaries with low - mass companions are ordinary cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) rather ssss , suggesting that the wind - driven case may not be popular and some kind of accident is required to trigger the high luminosities .",
    "however , there are observational hints that rapid mass transfer might have occurred in cvs . for example , @xcite show that the mean wd mass among cvs ( @xmath99 ) is significantly larger than that found for pre - cvs ( @xmath100 ) and single wds ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one plausible explanation is that the wd mass has grown in cvs through accretion during episodes of stable hydrogen and helium burning .",
    "a potentially important factor we have neglected is the magnetic field of the wds .",
    "it is well known that a considerable fraction ( @xmath101 ) of cvs possess magnetic wds named as polars and intermediate polars .",
    "recent observations show that wds with magnetic fields @xmath102 mg have mean mass @xmath103 ; for wds with @xmath104 mg , @xmath105 @xcite , suggesting that mass growth may be related to the magnetic field strength .",
    "hydrogen burning on magnetic and non - magnetic wds could be in different ways , even at the same accretion rate .",
    "for accretion onto the entire surface of a wd , the accretion rate required to sustain stable hydrogen burning is @xmath106yr@xmath13",
    ". no cvs can reach such high rates driven by angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking and gravitational radiation .",
    "however , if the accreting material is funneled onto a small portion of the wd surface by the magnetic lines , then the local accretion rate will be large enough to sustain local stable hydrogen burning @xcite . this enhances the effective rate of accretion compared to spherical accretion .",
    "the fraction of the wd surface covered by the accretion spot measured in magnetic cv systems is typically @xmath107 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , thus steady hydrogen burning requires that the accretion rate be @xmath108yr@xmath13 .",
    "this means that magnetic wds may achieve a long - lasting sss phase with a greatly lower accretion rate than non - magnetic wds .",
    "x - ray irradiation from the sss will be able to heat the surface of the companion star , excite winds and sustain a relatively high accretion rate for a long time .",
    "this configuration was recently discussed by @xcite in the context of wd / m dwarf binaries .",
    "the author argues that even modest magnetic fields on the wd and m dwarf will be able to lock the two stars together , resulting in a slowly rotating wd .",
    "the mass loss will be channeled by a magnetic bottle connecting the two stars , landing on a concentrated polar area on the wd .",
    "luminosity from accretion and hydrogen burning on the surface of the wd may induce self - excited mass transfer .",
    "obviously the wind - driven evolution for magnetic wds will be of great interest as a possible pathway to sne ia and be investigated in the future work .",

    "<S> in the single degenerate scenario for the progenitors of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , a white dwarf rapidly accretes hydrogen- or helium - rich material from its companion star , and appears as a supersoft x - ray source . </S>",
    "<S> this picture has been challenged by the properties of the supersoft x - ray sources with very low - mass companions and the observations of several nearby sne ia . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out that , the x - ray radiation or the wind from the accreting white dwarf can excite wind or strip mass from the companion star , thus significantly influence the mass transfer processes . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we perform detailed calculations of the wind - driven evolution of white dwarf binaries . </S>",
    "<S> we present the parameter space for the possible sn ia progenitors , and for the surviving companions after the sne . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the ex - companion stars of sne ia have characteristics more compatible with the observations , compared to those in the traditional single degenerate scenario . </S>"
