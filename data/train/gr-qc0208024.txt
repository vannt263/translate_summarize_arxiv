    "( psalm 85:10 ) _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in this festschrift volume in honor of john archibald wheeler , i would like to take a fresh look at the intersection between two fields to which he devoted much of his research life : general relativity ( gr ) and quantum mechanics ( qm ) .",
    "as evidence of his keen interest in these two subjects , i would cite two examples from my own experience .",
    "when i was an undergraduate at princeton university during the years from 1957 to 1961 , he was my adviser .",
    "one of his duties was to assign me topics for my junior paper and for my senior thesis . for my junior paper ,",
    "i was assigned the topic : compare the complementarity and the uncertainty principles of quantum mechanics : which is more fundamental ? for my senior thesis ,",
    "i was assigned the topic : how to quantize general relativity ? as wheeler taught me , more than half of science is devoted to the asking of the right question , while often less than half is devoted to the obtaining of the correct answer , but not always !     in the same spirit",
    ", i would like to offer up here some questions concerning conceptual tensions between gr and qm , which hopefully can be answered in the course of time by experiments , and , in particular , to make some specific experimental proposals , such as the use of macroscopic quantum objects like superconductors , as quantum transducers and antennas for gravitational radiation , in order to probe the tension between the concepts of @xmath1 in gr and @xmath0 in qm .    .",
    "the left circle represents relativity , and is labeled by the two constants @xmath7 , the speed of light , and @xmath8 , newton s constant .",
    "the right circle represents statistical mechanics and thermodynamics , and is labeled by boltzmann s constant @xmath9 .",
    "conceptual tensions exist at the intersections of these three circles , which may lead to fruitful experimental consequences . ]",
    "as i see it , the three main pillars of physics at the beginning of the 21st century are quantum mechanics , relativity , and statistical mechanics , which correspond to einstein s three papers of 1905 .",
    "there exist conceptual tensions at the intersections of these three fields of physics ( see figure [ threecircles ] ) .",
    "it seems worthwhile re - examining these tensions , since they may lead to new experimental discoveries . in this introduction ,",
    "i shall only briefly mention three conceptual tensions between these three fields : @xmath10 versus @xmath0 of physical systems , @xmath11 versus @xmath12 of probabilities in quantum and statistical mechanics ( the problem of the nature of information ) , and @xmath13 versus @xmath14 of time ( the problem of the arrows of time ) .",
    "others in this volume will discuss the second and  the third of these tensions in detail .",
    "i shall limit myself to a discussion of the first conceptual tension concerning locality versus nonlocality , mainly in the context of gr and qm .",
    "( however , in my solvay lecture @xcite , i have discussed the other two tensions in more detail ) .    why examine conceptual tensions ?",
    "a brief answer is that they often lead to experimental discoveries .",
    "it suffices to give just one example from late 19th and early 20th century physics : the clash between the venerable concepts of @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the concept of continuity , which goes back to the greek philosopher heraclitus ( `` everything flows '' ) , clashed with the concept of discreteness , which goes back to democritus ( `` everything is composed of atoms '' ) .",
    "eventually , heraclitus s concept of continuity , or more specifically that of the @xmath17 , was embodied in the idea of @xmath18 in the classical field theory associated with maxwell s equations .",
    "the atomic hypothesis of democritus was eventually embodied in the kinetic theory of gases in statistical mechanics .",
    "conceptual tensions , or what wheeler calls the `` clash of ideas , '' need not lead to a complete victory of one conflicting idea over the other , so as to eliminate the opposing one completely , as seemed to be the case in the 19th century , when newton s idea of `` corpuscles of light '' was apparently completely eliminated in favor of the wave theory of light .  rather , there may result a reconciliation of the two conflicting ideas , which  then often leads to many fruitful experimental consequences .",
    "experiments on blackbody radiation in the 19th century were exploring the intersection , or borderline , between maxwell s theory of electromagnetism and statistical mechanics , where the conceptual tension between continuity and discreteness was most acute , and eventually led to the discovery of quantum mechanics through the work of planck .",
    "the concept of @xmath16 metamorphosed into the concept of the @xmath19 .",
    "this led  in turn to the concept of _ discontinuity _ embodied in bohr s _ quantum jump _ hypothesis , which was necessitated by the indivisibility of the quantum .",
    "many experiments , such as millikan s measurements of @xmath20 , were in turn motivated by einstein s heuristic theory of the photoelectric effect based on the quantum hypothesis .",
    "newton s idea of `` corpuscles of light '' metamorphosed into the concept of the @xmath21 .",
    "this is a striking example showing how that many fruitful experimental consequences can come out of one particular conceptual tension .    within a broader cultural context",
    ", there have been many acute conceptual tensions between science and faith , which have lasted over many centuries",
    ". perhaps the above examples of the fruitfulness of the resolution of conceptual tensions within physics itself may serve as a parable concerning the possibility of a peaceful reconciliation of these great cultural tensions , which may eventually lead to the further growth of both science and faith .",
    "hence we should not shy away from conceptual tensions , but rather explore them with an honest , bold , and open spirit .",
    "here i shall focus my attention specifically on some conceptual tensions at the intersection between qm and gr .",
    "a commonly held viewpoint within the physics community today is that the only place where conceptual tensions between these two fields can arise is at the microscopic planck length scale , where quantum fluctuations of spacetime ( `` quantum foam '' ) occur .",
    "hence manifestations of these tensions would be expected to occur only in conjunction with extremely high - energy phenomena , accessible presumably only in astrophysical settings , such as the big bang .     however , i believe that this point of view is too narrow .",
    "there exist other  conceptual tensions at macroscopic , non - planckian  distance scales , which should be accessible in low - energy laboratory experiments involving macroscopic qm phenomena .",
    "it should be kept in mind that qm not only describes @xmath22 phenomena , but also @xmath23 phenomena , such as superconductivity .",
    "specifically , i would like to point out the followingthree conceptual tensions :    \\(1 ) the _ spatial nonseparability _ of physical systems due to entangled states in qm , versus the complete _ spatial separability _ of all physical systems in gr .",
    "\\(2 ) the _ equivalence principle _ of gr , versus the _ uncertainty principle _ of qm .",
    "\\(3 ) the _ mixed state _",
    "( e.g. , of an entangled bipartite system , one part of which falls into a black hole ; the other of which flies off to infinity ) in gr , versus the _ pure state _ of such a system in qm .",
    "conceptual tension ( 3 ) concerns the problem of the nature of information in qm and gr .",
    "again , since others will discuss this tension in detail in this volume , i shall limit myself only to a discussion of the first two of these tensions .",
    "these conceptual tensions originate from the _ superposition principle _ of qm , which finds its most dramatic expression in the _ entangled state _ of two or more spatially separated particles of a single physical system , which in turn leads to einstein - podolsky - rosen  ( epr ) effects .",
    "it should be emphasized here that it is necessary to consider _ two or more _",
    "particles for observing epr phenomena , since only then does the _ configuration space _ of these particles no longer coincide with that of ordinary spacetime .  for example , consider the entangled state of two spin 1/2 particles in a bohm singlet state initially prepared in a total spin zero state @xmath24 in which the two particles in a spontaneous decay process fly arbitrarily far away from each other into two space - like separated regions of spacetime , where measurements on spin by means of two stern - gerlach apparati are performed separately on these two particles .     as a result of the quantum entanglement arising from the @xmath25 of @xmath26 states , such as in the above bohm singlet state , it is in general impossible to factorize this state into products of probability amplitudes .",
    "hence it is impossible to factorize the @xmath27 probabilities in the measurements of spin of this two - particle system .",
    "this mathematical @xmath28 implies a physical @xmath29 of the system , and leads to instantaneous , space - like correlations - at - a - distance in the joint measurements of the properties ( e.g. , spin ) of discrete events , such as in the coincidence detection of `` clicks '' in geiger counters placed behind the two distant stern - gerlach apparati .",
    "these long - range correlations violate bell s inequalities , and therefore can not be explained on the basis of any _ local realistic _ theories .",
    "violations of bell s inequalities have been extensively experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "these violations were predicted by qm .",
    "if we assume a realistic world view , i.e. , that the `` clicks '' of the geiger counters really happened , then we must conclude that we have observed @xmath30 features of the world .",
    "therefore , a fundamental _ spatial nonseparability _ of physical systems has been revealed by these bell - inequalities - violating epr correlations @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that these space - like epr correlations occur on macroscopic , non - planckian distance scales , where the conceptual tension ( 1 ) between qm and gr becomes most acute .",
    "gravity is a _ long - range _ force .",
    "it is therefore  natural  to expect that experimental consequences of conceptual tension ( 1 )  should manifest themselves most dramatically in the  interaction of macroscopic quantum matter , which exhibit _ long - range _ epr correlations , with _ long - range _ gravitational fields .  in particular ,",
    "the question naturally arises : how do entangled states , such as the bohm singlet state , interact with tidal fields , such as those in gravitational radiation taylor ?",
    "it is therefore natural to look to the realm of  _ macroscopic _ , long - range quantum phenomena , such as superconductivity , rather than phenomena at _ microscopic _ , planck length scales , in our search for these experimental consequences .",
    "already a decade or so before bell s ground - breaking work on his famous inequality , einstein himself was clearly worried by the radical , spatial nonseparability of physical systems in quantum mechanics .",
    "einstein wrote @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  let us consider a physical system s@xmath31 , which consists of two part - systems s@xmath32 and s@xmath33 .",
    "these two part - systems may have been in a state of mutual physical interaction at an earlier time .",
    "we are , however , considering them at a time when this interaction is at an end .",
    "let the entire system be completely described in the quantum mechanical sense by a @xmath34-function @xmath35 of the coordinates @xmath36 , ... and @xmath37 , ... of the two part - systems ( @xmath35 can not be represented as a product of the form @xmath38 but only as a sum of such products [ _ i.e. , as an entangled state _ ] ) .  at timetlet",
    "the two part - systems be separated from each other in space , in such a way that @xmath35 only differs from zero when @xmath39 , ... belong to a limited part r@xmath32 of space and  @xmath40 , ... belong to a part r@xmath33 separated from r@xmath32 .  . . .",
    "`` there seems to me no doubt that those physicists who regard the descriptive methods of quantum mechanics as definitive in principle would react to this line of thought in the following way : they would drop the requirement for _ the independent existence of the physical reality present in different parts of space _ ; they would be justified in pointing out that the quantum theory nowhere makes explicit use of this requirement .

    "however , i should hasten to add immediately that the battle - tested concept of _ field _ has of course been extremely fruitful not only at the classical but also at the quantum level .",
    "relativistic quantum field theories have been very well validated , at least in an approximate , correspondence - principle sense in which spacetime itself is treated classically , i.e. , as being describable by a rigidly flat , minkowskian metric , which has no  possibility of any quantum dynamics .",
    "there have been tremendous successes of quantum electrodynamics and electroweak gauge field theory ( and , to a lesser extent , quantum chromodynamics ) in passing all known high - energy experimental tests .",
    "thus the conceptual tension between @xmath41 ( used in the concept of the spacetime @xmath17 ) and @xmath42 ( used in the concept of _ quantized excitations _ of a field in classical spacetime ) seems to have been successfully reconciled in these relativistic quantum field theories .",
    "nevertheless , the problem of a satisfactory relativistic treatment of quantum measurement within these theories remains an open one .      here",
    "i shall propose some low - energy experimental probes of conceptual tension ( 1 ) , using _ macroscopically entangled _ , and thus _ radically delocalized _ , quantum states encountered in large quantum objects , such as superconductors , superfluids , and the recently observed atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , i.e. , in what i shall henceforth call `` quantum fluids . ''",
    "again it should be stressed that gravity is a _ long - range _ force , and therefore it should be possible to perform _ low - energy _ experiments to probe the interaction between gravity and these kinds of quantum matter on large , non - planckian distance scales , without the necessity of performing high - energy experiments , as is required for probing the short - range weak and strong forces on very short distance scales .",
    "the quantum many - body problem , even in its nonrelativistic limit , may lead to nontrivial interactions with weak , long - range gravitational fields .",
    "one is thereby  strongly motivated to study the interaction of quantum fluids with weak gravity , in particular , with gravitational radiation .",
    "one manifestation of this conceptual tension is that the way one views a quantum fluid in qm is conceptually radically different from the way that one views a perfect fluid in gr , where only the @xmath43 properties of the fluid , which can conceptually always be spatially separated into independent , infinitesimal fluid elements , are to be considered .",
    "for example , interstellar dust particles can be thought of as being a perfect fluid in gr , provided that we can neglect all interactions between such particles .",
    "the response of these particles in this  classical many - body system to a gravitational wave passing over it , is characterized by the local , free - fall motion of each dust particle .",
    "these particles are treated as test particles in gr , and they do not react back upon the gravitational wave .",
    "the weak equivalence principle tells us that the gravitational force from the wave vanishes in the local , freely - falling inertial frame centered on a given dust particle , and hence can not do any work on this particle in the absence of any mutual interactions between the particles .",
    "there is therefore no possibility of any energy transfer at all from the gravitational wave to this classical many - body system , so that it is impossible to use such a system of @xmath44 classical particles to construct an antenna for receiving or emitting gravitational radiation .     by contrast , due to their radical delocalization",
    ", particles in a macroscopic quantum many - body system , such as a superconductor , are entangled with each other in such a way that there arises an unusual `` quantum rigidity '' of the system , closely associated with what london called `` the rigidity of the macroscopic wavefunction '' @xcite .",
    "this rigidity arises from the single - valuedness of the macroscopic ground - state wavefunction , and the fact that there exists an energy gap ( the bcs gap ) separating the ground state from all the excited states of the system .",
    "there should arise from this rigidity of the wavefunction not only the usual meissner effect , in which the magnetic field is expelled from the interior of the superconductor , but also a meissner - like effect , in which the lense - thirring field of the gravitational wave is also expelled , as we shall presently see .",
    "this  in turn should lead to a mirror - like reflection of a gravitational plane wave from the surface of the superconductor .",
    "unfortunately , there is no way to check whether this actually occurs or not , without a practical laboratory emitter and receiver of gravitational radiation .",
    "however , we shall see that closely associated with this meissner - like effect , there also should arise a direct coupling between the electromagnetic ( em ) and gravitational ( gr ) radiation fields at the surface of a certain type of superconductor , in a quantum kind of direct transducer action .  in this way ,",
    "practical laboratory emitters and receivers of gravity waves could indeed become possible .",
    "thus a _ quantum fluid _ in qm should behave in a radically different manner from that of a _ perfect fluid _ in gr , in their respective responses to gravitational radiation .     in an ideal bec",
    ", there would seem to be no quantum entanglement , since the total condensate wavefunction can be written as a tensor product of many copies of the same one - particle wavefunction , one for each particle .",
    "however , as a necessary condition for the formation of any actual bec , including the recently discovered atomic becs , there must be mutual interactions between the particles , such as repulsive @xmath6-wave scattering .",
    "each scattering event @xmath45 the momenta of the two particles that participate in it .",
    "the many particle - particle scatterings , for example , the hard - sphere collisions in superfluid helium , naturally lead to a macroscopically entangled state .",
    "moreover , in the case of superconductivity , a given cooper pair of electrons in the superconductor is in a bohm singlet state , which is an entangled state in which the two electrons in the cooper pair have opposite spins @xmath46 opposite momenta .",
    "the unusual states of matter in these quantum fluids all possess _ spontaneous symmetry breaking _ , in which the ground state , or the vacuum state , of the quantum many - body system ( any @xmath47 , or _ many - body wavefunction _ ,",
    "is purely a quantum concept ) breaks the symmetry of the hamiltonian of the system ( any quantum hamiltonian , however , can be conceived of as a classical one in the correspondence - principle limit ) . the physical vacuum , which is in an intrinsically nonlocal ground state of a relativistic quantum field theory , possesses certain similarities to the ground state of a superconductor .",
    "weinberg has argued that in superconductivity , the spontaneous symmetry breaking process results in a broken @xmath48 invariance @xcite , an idea which traces back to the early work of nambu @xcite .",
    "the meissner effect is closely analogous to the higgs mechanism of high - energy physics , in which the physical vacuum also spontaneously breaks local gauge invariance . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the appearance of the london penetration depth for a superconductor is analogous in an inverse manner to the appearance of a mass for a gauge boson , such as that of the w or z boson .",
    "thus , the photon , viewed as a gauge boson , acquires a mass inside the superconductor , such that its compton wavelength becomes the london penetration depth .     closely related to this spontaneous symmetry breaking process is the appearance of yang s off - diagonal long - range order ( odlro ) of the reduced density matrix in the coordinate - space representation for these macroscopically coherent quantum systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , there seems to be no limit on how far apart cooper pairs can be inside a single superconductor before they lose their quantum coherence .",
    "odlro and spontaneous symmetry breaking are both purely quantum concepts .     within a superconductor there should arise both the phenomenon of instantaneous epr correlations - at - a - distance and the phenomenon of the rigidity of the wavefunction , i.e. , a meissner - like response to radiation fields .",
    "both phenomena , which we shall presently see are intimately connected , involve at the microscopic level @xmath49 of entangled electrons with an external environment , either through local @xmath50 , such as in bell - type experiments , or through local @xmath51 , such as those due to gravitational radiation fields interacting locally with these electrons .",
    "although at first sight the notion of `` infinite quantum rigidity '' would seem to imply infinite velocities , and hence would seem to violate relativity , there are in fact no violations of relativistic causality here , since the instantaneous epr @xmath52-at - a - distance ( as seen by an observer in the center - of - mass frame ) are not instantaneous @xmath53-at - a - distance , which could instantaneously connect causes to effects chiaoheisenberg .  also , experiments have verified the existence of superluminal wave packet propagations , i.e. , faster - than-@xmath7 , infinite , and even negative group velocities , for finite - bandwidth , analytic wave packets in the excitations of a wide range of physical systems @xcite@xcite .",
    "an analytic function , e.g. , a gaussian wave packet , contains sufficient information in its early tail such that a causal medium can , during its propagation , reconstruct the entire wave packet with a superluminal pulse advancement , and with little distortion .",
    "relativistic causality forbids  only the @xmath54 velocity , i.e. , the velocity of @xmath55 , which connects causes to their effects , from exceeding the speed of light @xmath7 , but does not forbid a wave packet s @xmath56 velocity from being superluminal .",
    "one example is the observed superluminal tunneling of single - photon wave packets @xcite .  in the case of superconductors ,",
    "the `` finite - bandwidth '' condition is guaranteed by the restriction that the local perturbations arising from classical fields only contain frequencies less than the bcs gap frequency , in order to satisfy the quantum adiabatic theorem .",
    "thus the notion of `` infinite quantum rigidity , '' although counterintuitive , does not in fact violate relativistic causality .",
    "i shall return to this point later in section 3 .      concerning conceptual tension ( 2 ) ,",
    "the weak equivalence principle is formulated at its outset using the concept of `` trajectory , '' or equivalently , `` geodesic . ''  by contrast , bohr has taught us that the very @xmath57 of trajectory must be abandoned , because of the uncertainty principle .",
    "thus the equivalence and the uncertainty principles are in a fundamental conceptual tension .  the equivalence principle is based on the idea of locality , since it requires that the region of space , inside which two trajectories of two nearby freely - falling objects of different masses , compositions , or thermodynamic states , are to be compared , go to zero volume , before the principle becomes exact .",
    "this limiting procedure is in conflict with the uncertainty principle , since taking the limit of the volume of space going to zero , within which these objects are to be measured , makes their momenta infinitely uncertain .",
    "experimental manifestations of this conceptual tension may occur not only on microscopic , but also on macroscopic length scales , again since there exist macroscopic quantum objects .",
    "however , whenever the correspondence principle holds , the _ center of mass _ of a quantum wavepacket ( for a single particle or for an entire quantum object ) moves according to ehrenfest s theorem along a classical trajectory , and @xmath58 it is possible to reconcile these two principles .    davies @xcite  has come up with a simple example of a quantum violation of the equivalence principle @xcite@xcite : consider two perfectly elastic balls , e.g. , one made out of rubber , and one made out of steel , bouncing against a perfectly elastic table .",
    "if we drop the two balls from the same height above the table , their classical trajectories , and hence their classical periods of oscillation will be identical , and independent of the mass or composition of the balls .",
    "this is a consequence of the weak equivalence principle .",
    "however , quantum mechanically , there will be the phenomenon of tunneling , in which the two balls can penetrate into the classically forbidden region @xmath59 their turning points .  the extra time spent by the balls in the classically forbidden region due to tunneling",
    "will depend on their mass ( and thus on their composition ) .  thus there will in principle",
    "be _ mass - dependent _ quantum corrections of the classical periods of the bouncing motion of these balls , which will lead to quantum violations of the equivalence principle .",
    "there exist macroscopic situations in which ehrenfest s correspondence principle fails .",
    "imagine that one is inside a large quantum object , such as a big piece of superconconductor .",
    "even in the limit of a very large size and a very large number of particles in this object ( i.e. , the thermodynamic limit ) , there exists no correspondence - principle limit in which classical trajectories or geodesics for the electrons which are members of cooper pairs within the superconductor , make any sense",
    ".  this may be true in spite of the fact that the motion of its center of mass of the superconductor may perfectly obey the equivalence principle , and therefore may be conceptualized in terms of a geodesic",
    ".     however , due to the uncertainty principle and the indistinguishability of identical particles , the electrons of the bcs ground state of a superconductor are radically delocalized .",
    "hence one again expects that a superconductor should respond to externally applied gravitational fields , including radiation fields , in a radically different fashion from the response of normal electrons undergoing geodesic motions inside a normal metal .",
    "experimentally , this radical difference should show up when one cools a normal metal through the superconducting transition temperature , so that it becomes a superconductor .",
    "another  strong motivation for performing the quantum calculation to be given below , is that it predicts a large , counterintuitive _ quantum rigidity _ of a macroscopic wavefunction , such as that in a big piece of superconductor , when it interacts with externally applied gravitationalradiation fields @xcite .",
    "mathematically , this quantum rigidity corresponds to the statement that the macroscopic wavefunction of the superconductor must remain _ single - valued _ at all times during the changes arising from adiabatic perturbations due to radiation fields .",
    "this implies that objects such as superconductors should be much better gravitational - wave antennas than weber bars .     the rigidity of the macroscopic wavefunction  of the superconductor originates from the instantaneous einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) correlations - at - a - distance in the behavior of a cooper pair of electrons in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) ground state in distant parts of the superconductor viewed as a single quantum system , when there exists some kind of gap , such as the bcs gap , which keeps the entire system adiabatically in its ground state during perturbations due to radiation .",
    "two electrons which are members of a single cooper pair are in a bohm singlet state , and hence are quantum - mechanically entangled with each other , in the sense that they are in a superposition state of opposite spins @xmath46 opposite momenta .",
    "this quantum entanglement gives rise to epr correlations at long distance scales within the superconductor .",
    "the electrons in a superconductor in its ground bcs state are not only @xmath60 entangled , but due to the existence of the bcs gap which separates the bcs ground state energetically from all excited states , they are also @xmath61 entangled , in the sense that this entangled state is protected by the presence of the bcs gap from decoherence arising from the thermal environment , provided that the system temperature is kept well below the bcs transition temperature .",
    "the resulting large quantum rigidity is in contrast to the tiny rigidity of classical matter , such as that of the normal metals used in weber bars , in their response to gravitational radiation .",
    "the essential difference between quantum and classical matter is that there can exist macroscopic quantum interference , and hence macroscopic quantum coherence , throughout the entire quantum system , which is absent in a classical system .",
    "one manifestation of the tiny rigidity of classical matter is the fact that the speed of sound in a weber bar is typically five orders of magnitude less than the speed of light .  in order to transfer energy coherently from a gravitational wave by classical means , for example , by acoustical modes inside the bar  to some local detector , e.g. ,",
    "a piezoelectric crystal glued to the middle of the bar , the length scale of the weber bar @xmath62 is limited to a distance scale on the order of the speed of sound times the period of the gravitational wave , i.e. , an acoustical wavelength @xmath63 , which is typically five orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational radiation wavelength @xmath64 to be detected .",
    "this makes the weber bar , which is thereby limited in its length to @xmath65 , much too short an antenna to couple efficiently to free space .     however , macroscopic quantum objects such as superconductors used as antennas are not limited by these classical considerations , but can have a length scale @xmath62 on the same order as ( or even much greater than ) the gravitational radiation wavelength @xmath64 .  since the radiation efficiency of a quadrupole antenna scales as the length of the antenna @xmath62 to the fourth power when @xmath66",
    ", quantum antennas should be much more efficient in coupling to free space than classical ones like the weber bar by at least a factor of @xmath67 .",
    "also , we shall see below that a certain type of superconductor may be a @xmath68 for directly converting gravitational waves into electromagnetic waves , and vice versa ; this then dispenses altogether with the necessity of the use of piezoelectric crystals as transducers .",
    "weinberg @xcite  gives a measure of the efficiency of coupling of a weber bar antenna of mass @xmath69 , length @xmath62 , and velocity of sound @xmath70 , in terms of a branching ratio for the emission of gravitational radiation by the weber bar , relative to the emission of heat , i.e. , the ratio of the @xmath71 of emission of gravitational radiation @xmath72 relative to the @xmath73 of the decay of the acoustical oscillations into heat @xmath74 , which is given by@xmath75the quartic power dependence of the efficiency @xmath76  on the velocity of sound @xmath70 arises from the quartic dependence of the coupling efficiency to free space of a quadrupole antenna upon its length @xmath62 , when @xmath77 .",
    "assuming for the moment that the quantum rigidity of a superconductor allows us to replace the velocity of sound @xmath70 by the speed of light @xmath7 ( i.e. , that the typical size @xmath62 of a quantum antenna bar can become as large as the wavelength @xmath64 ) , we see that superconductors can be more efficient than weber bars , based on the @xmath78 factor alone , by twenty orders of magnitude , i.e. , @xmath79thus , even if it should turn out that superconducting antennas in the final analysis are still not very efficient @xmath80 of gravitational radiation , they should be much more efficient @xmath81 of this radiation than weber bars for detecting astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation @xcite@xcite@xcite",

    "but why should the speed of sound in superconductors , which is not much different from that in normal metals , not also characterize the rigidity of a superconducting metal when it is in a superconducting state ?",
    "what is it about a superconductor in its superconducting state that makes it so radically different from the same metal when it is in a normal state ?",
    "the answer lies in the important distinction between @xmath82 and @xmath83 mechanical excitations of the superconductor currentcorrelation .  whereas longitudinal , compressional sound waves propagate in superconductors at normal sound speeds , transverse excitations , such as those  induced by a gravitational plane wave incident normally on a slab of superconductor in its superconducting state , can not so propagate .",
    "suppose that the opposite were true , i.e. , that there were @xmath84 substantial difference between the response of a superconductor and a normal metal to gravitational radiation .",
    "( let us assume for the moment the complete absence of any electromagnetic radiation . )",
    "then the interaction of the superconductor with gravitational radiation , either in its normal or in its superconducting state , will be completely negligible , as is indicated by eq.([weinbergeff ] ) .",
    "we would then expect the gravitational wave to penetrate deeply into the interior of the superconductor ( see figure circulations ) .",
    "if this were true , the motion of a cooper pair deep inside the superconductor ( i.e. , deep on the scale of the london penetration depth ) , could then be characterized by a velocity @xmath85 which would not be appreciably different from the velocity of a normal electron or of a nearby lattice ion ( we shall neglect the velocity of sound in this argument , since @xmath86 ) .  hence locally , by the weak equivalence principle ,",

    "this , however , leads to a contradiction .",
    "it is well known that for adiabatic perturbations ( e.g. , for gravity waves whose frequencies are sufficiently far below the bcs gap frequency , so that the entire quantum system remains @xmath95 in its ground state ) , the superfluid velocity field @xmath85 deep in the interior of the superconductor ( i.e. , at a depth much greater than the london penetration depth ) must remain @xmath96 at all times @xcite , i.e.,@xmath97otherwise , if this irrotational condition were not satisfied in the presence of gravitational radiation , the wavefunction would not remain single - valued .",
    "deep inside the superconductor , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the mass of the cooper pair .",
    "thus the superfluid or cooper pair velocity is directly proportional to the spatial gradient of the phase @xmath100 of the cooper - pair condensate wavefunction .",
    "it would then follow , from such a  supposed violation of the irrotational condition , that the phase shift @xmath101 after one round - trip back to the same point around an arbitrary closed curve @xmath102 deep inside the superconductor in its ground state , is , upon using stokes s theorem , @xmath103where @xmath104 is a surface bounded by @xmath102 ( see figure [ circulations ] ) .",

    "this phase anomaly @xmath105 is also directly proportional to a _ nonvanishing _ component of the riemann curvature tensor .",

    "otherwise , the very concept of _ wavefunction _ would become meaningless .     along the @xmath106 axis , which induces tidal motions along the @xmath107 axis resulting in the velocity field @xmath108 of test particles , as seen by an observer sitting in an inertial frame centered on the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) of the superconductor .",
    "after half a wavelength of propagation , these tidal motions reverse sign .",
    "hence there exists nonvanishing circulations around the circuits @xmath109 and @xmath110 , i.e. , @xmath111 of the gravitomagnetic ( or lense - thirring ) field inside @xmath109 and @xmath112 .",

    "the propagation depicted here of a gr wave penetrating deeply into the interior of a thick slab of superconductor ( which is thick compared to the wavelength @xmath114 ) would violate the single - valuedness of the wavefunction .",
    "however , the existence of a meissner - like effect , in which all the radiation fields of the gr wave , including its lense - thirring fields , are totally expelled from the superconductor ( apart from a thin surface layer of the order of the london penetration depth ) , would prevent such a violation . ]",
    "there is extensive experimental evidence that the single - valuedness of the wavefunction in qm is not violated .",
    "for example , the observed quantization of orbital angular momentum in atoms and molecules constitutes such evidence on microscopic length scales .",
    "also , the observations of quantization of the circulation of vortices in both superfluids helium of isotope 3 and helium of isotope 4 , and of the quantization of flux in superconductors , constitute such evidence on macroscopic length scales .  as a special case of the latter",
    "when the topological winding number is zero , the meissner effect is itself evidence for the validity of the single - valuedness of the macroscopic wavefunction .",
    "therefore , in the presence of a gravity wave , cooper pairs @xmath115 undergo free fall , and the @xmath116 excitations of the cooper pair condensate must remain rigidly irrotational at all times in the adiabatic limit .",
    "this leads to a meissner - like effect in which the lense - thirring field @xmath117 is expelled , and would seemingly lead to infinite velocities for the transverse excitations inside the superconductor .",
    "( see the above discussion of superluminality . )",
    "however , such transverse excitations should be coupled  to  perturbations of spacetime through the maxwell - like equations for the time - varying gravitational fields to be discussed below , and then the speed of such excitations may turn out to be governed by the vacuum speed of light @xmath7 .",
    "the calculation for the  @xmath19 response of large objects , for example , a big piece of superconductor , to weak gravitational radiation , is based on the concept of @xmath118 , or _ quantum state _ , for example , the bcs state , and proceeds along completely different lines from the calculation for the @xmath119 response of a weber bar to this radiation , which is based on the concept of @xmath120 , or _",
    "classical trajectory _ @xcite .",
    "when the frequency of the gravitational radiation is  much less than the bcs gap , the entire superconductor should evolve in time in accordance with the quantum adiabatic theorem , and should therefore stay rigidly , i.e. , adiabatically , in its ground state .",
    "there results a large , diamagnetic - like _ linear response _ of the entire superconductor to externally applied , time - varying gravitational fields .",
    "this meissner - like effect does not alter the geodesic center - of - mass motion of the superconductor , but radically alters the internal behavior of its electrons , which are all radically delocalized due to entanglement within the superconductor .    here",
    "i would like to give a brief historical survey of this problem .",
    "in 1966 , dewitt @xcite  considered the interaction of a superconductor with gravitational fields , in particular with the lense - thirring field . starting from the general relativistic lagrangian for a single electron with a charge @xmath121 and a mass @xmath122 , he derived in the limit of weak gravity and slow particles a nonrelativistic hamiltonian for a single electron in the superconductor , which satisfied the minimal - coupling rule@xmath123where @xmath124 is the canonical momentum , @xmath125 is the usual vector potential , and @xmath126 is a gauge - like vector potential formed from the three space - time components @xmath127 of the metric tensor viewed as an ordinary three - vector .",

    "in 1985 , anandan @xcite  considered the possibility of using superconducting circuits as detectors for astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation , but did not mention the possibility of superconductors being efficient emitters , and thus practical laboratory sources of gravity waves , as is being considered here .  in 1990 ,",
    "peng and torr used the generalized london equations to treat the interaction of a bulk superconductor with gravitational radiation , and concluded that such a superconducting antenna would be many orders of magnitude more sensitive than a weber bar @xcite .",

    "i shall show below that josephson junctions , which are difficult to implement experimentally , are unnecessary , and that a superconductor can by itself be a @xmath129 transducer from electromagnetic to gravitational radiation upon reflection of the wave from a vacuum - superconductor interface , with a surprisingly good conversion efficiency .  by reciprocity ,",
    "this conversion process can be reversed , so that gravitational radiation can also be converted upon reflection into electromagnetic radiation from the same interface , with equal efficiency .",

    "the calculation of the coupling energy of the superconductor in the simultaneous presence of both electromagnetic and gravitational fields starts from the lagrangian for a single particle of rest mass @xmath122 and charge @xmath121 ( i.e. , an electron , but neglecting its spin)@xmath132from which a minimal - coupling form of the hamiltonian  for an electron in a superconductor , in the limit of @xmath133 gravitational fields and @xmath134 velocities , has been derived by dewitt @xcite .",

    "this minimal - coupling rule has been experimentally tested in the case of a uniformly rotating superconducting ring , since it predicts the existence of a london magnetic moment for the rotating superconductor , in which magnetic flux is generated through the center of the ring due to its rotational motion with respect to the local inertial frame .",
    "the consequences of the above minimal coupling rule for the slightly different geometry of a uniformly rotating superconducting sphere can be easily worked out as follows : due to the single - valuedness of the wavefunction , the aharonov - bohm and sagnac phase shifts deep inside the superconducting sphere ( i.e. , in the interior far away from the surface ) arising from the @xmath125 and the @xmath126 terms , must cancel each other exactly .",
    "thus the minimal coupling rule leads to a relationship between the @xmath125 and the @xmath126 fields inside the bulk given by @xmath156this relationship in turn implies that  a uniform magnetic field @xmath157 , where @xmath158 in the symmetric gauge , will be generated in the interior of the superconducting sphere due to its uniform rotational motion at an angular velocity @xmath159 with respect to the local inertial frame , where @xmath160 in the rotating frame .",
    "thus the london moment effect will manifest itself here as a uniform magnetic field @xmath161 in the interior of the rigidly rotating sphere , which can be calculated by taking the curl of both sides of  eq.([a and h ] ) , and yields@xmath162which is consistent with larmor s theorem .  in general ,",
    "the proportionality constant of the london moment will be given by the inverse of the charge - to - mass ratio @xmath163 , where @xmath99 has been experimentally determined to be the @xmath164 value of the cooper pair rest mass , apart from a small discrepancy of the order of ten parts per million , which has not yet been completely understood @xcite .",
    "however , in the above argument , we have been assuming rigid - body rotation for the entire body of the superconductor , which is obviously not valid for microwave - frequency gravitational radiation fields , since the lattice can not respond to such high frequencies in such a rigid manner .",
    "hence the above analysis applies  only to time - independent ( i.e. , magnetostatic ) and spatially homogeneous ( i.e. , uniform ) magnetic fields and steady rotations , and is not valid for the high - frequency , time - dependent , and spatially inhomogeneous case of the interaction of gravitational and electromagnetic radiation fields near the surface of the superconductor , since the above magnetostatic analysis ignores the important boundary - value and impedance - matching problems for radiation fields at the vacuum - superconductor interface , which will be considered below .",

    "the impedance - matching problem of a plane wave impinging on a  thin , resistive film is solved by using standard boundary conditions in conjunction with the constitutive relation @xmath242 .    similarly , for @xmath133 gravity and",
    "@xmath243 matter , maxwell - like equations have been derived from the linearized form of einstein s field equations forward@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the gravitoelectric field @xmath244 , which is identical to the local acceleration due to gravity @xmath245 ,  is analogous to the electric field @xmath246 , and the gravitomagnetic field @xmath247 , which is identical to the lense - thirring field , is analogous to the magnetic field @xmath161 ; they are related to the vector potential @xmath126  in the radiation gauge as follows:@xmath248which correspond to the electromagnetic relations in the radiation gauge@xmath249the physical meaning of @xmath245 is that it is the three - acceleration of a local , freely - falling test particle induced by the gravitational radiation , as seen by an observer in a local inertial frame located at the center of mass of the superconductor .",
    "the local three - acceleration @xmath250 is the local time derivative  of the local three - velocity @xmath148 of this test particle , which is a member of a system of noninteracting , locally freely - falling ,  classical test particles ( e.g. , interstellar dust ) with a velocity field @xmath251 as viewed by an observer in the center - of - mass inertial frame . similarly , the physical meaning of the gravitomagnetic field @xmath247 is that it is the local angular velocity of an inertial frame centered on the same test particle , with respect to the same observer s inertial frame , which is centered on the freely - falling center - of - mass of the superconductor .",
    "thus @xmath247is the lense - thirring field induced by gravitational radiation .     the maxwell - like equations for weak gravitational fields ( upon setting the ppn ( `` parametrized post - newton '' ) parameters to be those of general relativity ) are @xcite@xmath252@xmath253@xmath254@xmath255where @xmath256 is the density of local rest mass in the local rest frame of the matter , and @xmath257 is the local rest - mass current density in this frame ( in the case of classical matter , @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is the coordinate three - velocity of the local rest mass ; in the quantum case , see eq.([current density ] ) ) .",

    "otherwise , there could never be any dissipation of gravitational radiation as it propagates through a medium .",
    "the factor of 4 on the right hand side of eq.([kappa_ge ] ) implies that newton s law of universal gravitation emerges from einstein s theory of gr in the correspondence principle limit .  in this limit ,",
    "the weak equivalence principle is recovered by demanding that @xmath267 approach unity at low frequencies .",
    "the phenomenological parameters @xmath272 @xmath273 and @xmath274 must be determined by experiment .",
    "because of the possibility of large meissner - like effects such as in superconductors and other quantum fluids , @xmath268 can differ substantially from @xmath275 at low frequencies ( see appendix b ) .  the nonvanishing gravitomagnetic susceptibility calculated from eq.([gmenergy ] ) should lead to a value of @xmath268 compatible with such large meissner - like effects .",
    "also , note that @xmath276 can be spatially inhomogeneous , such as near the surface of a superconductor .",
    "but why is it even @xmath277 to introduce nontrivial constitutive relations , eqs.([kappa_ge ] ) , ( [ kappa_gm ] ) , and ( [ sigma_g ] ) , with @xmath278 , @xmath279 , and @xmath280 ?  one argument against the introduction of such relations",
    "is that the sources of all gravitational fields , including the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields , are entirely determined by the masses and the mass currents of the material medium in a _ composition - independent _ way , since the source of spacetime curvature in einstein s field equations arise solely from the stress - energy tensor , which includes the energy density , momentum density , and stress associated with all forms of matter and all nongravitational fields , and which is coupled to spacetime solely via @xmath8 .",
    "thus the source of spacetime curvature must be independent of the composition of the material sources , and of the kind of nongravitational interaction which binds the material together .  in this line of reasoning , there can not be any mysterious property of the material which would make @xmath267 , @xmath281 , and @xmath269  different for different materials .",
    "the only permissible values of these constants would then be @xmath282 , @xmath283 , and @xmath284 .",
    "otherwise , there would be a seeming violation of the equivalence principle , since there would then be a _ composition - dependent _ response of different kinds of matter to gravitational fields .",
    "however , one must carefully distinguish between the weak equivalence principle , which has been extensively experimentally tested in the low - frequency , _ newtonian - gravity _",
    "limit , and what i shall call the `` extended '' equivalence principle , which extends the composition - independence of the weak equivalence principle to include  the response , in particular , the _ linear response _ , of all kinds of matter to _ post - newtonian gravitational fields _ , such as to lense - thirring and gravitational radiation fields .  because of the difficulty of generating and detecting these post - newtonian fields , this `` extended '' equivalence principle has not been experimentally tested .     one implication of the `` extended '' equivalence principle would be that @xmath285 in the linear response of all matter to gravitational radiation at all frequencies .",
    "suppose that this `` extended '' equivalence principle were true .",
    "i shall argue below using the kramers - kronig relations , in particular , the zero - frequency sum rule which follows from these relations , that this would lead to a conflict with some known observational facts .",
    "the plane - wave solution of the above maxwell - like equations lead to the propagation of a gravitational plane wave at a frequency @xmath286 at a phase velocity @xmath287 given by@xmath288where the index of refraction @xmath289 of the medium for the gravitational plane wave is given by@xmath290such a solution is formally identical to that for an electromagnetic plane wave propagating inside a dispersive optical medium , whose index of refraction is given by @xmath291 .",
    "since we are considering the  _ linear response _ of the medium to @xmath133 gravitational radiation fields , and since the response of the medium must be @xmath292 , the index of refraction @xmath293 must obey the kramers - kronig relations @xcite@xmath294@xmath295where @xmath296 denotes the cauchy principal value .",
    "the zero - frequency sum rule follows from the first of these relations , viz.,@xmath297where @xmath298 is the power attenuation coefficient of the gravitational plane wave at frequency @xmath286 propagating through the medium , i.e. , @xmath299 is the exponential factor which attenuates the power of a wave propagating along the @xmath106 axis .",
    "the nonvanishing dissipation coefficient @xmath300 introduced in conjunction with the constitutive relation eq.([sigma_g ] ) will lead to a nonvanishing value of @xmath298 .  assuming that the medium is in its ground state",
    ", the gravity wave can not grow exponentially with propagation distance @xmath106 .",
    "hence @xmath301 for all frequencies @xmath286 , and therefore@xmath302    now suppose that the `` extended '' equivalence principle were true .  then at all frequencies @xmath303 and @xmath304 , independent of the composition of the medium .  in particular at low frequencies",
    ", this implies that the index of refraction@xmath305must strictly  be unity .",
    "it then follows from the above zero - frequency sum rule , that the attenuation coefficient@xmath306must strictly vanish for all frequencies @xmath286 .",
    "this result would imply that absorption of gravitational radiation would be impossible at any frequency by any kind of matter .",
    "detectors of gravitational radiation would be impossible due to this `` extended '' equivalence principle .  by reciprocity , emission of gravitational radiation by any kind of matter at any frequency",
    "would likewise also be impossible .",
    "gravitational radiation might as well not exist @xcite .",
    "this , however , is contradicted by the observations of taylor and weisberg @xcite .",
    "thus the `` extended '' equivalence principle must be a false extension of the weak equivalence principle .",
    "hence , not only is it @xmath277 , but it is also @xmath307 , to introduce constitutive equations with nontrivial values of @xmath308 , @xmath268 , and @xmath269 .",
    "it should be stressed here that although the above maxwell - like equations look formally identical to maxwell s ( apart from a sign change of the source terms ) , there is an elementary physical difference between gravity and electricity , which must not be overlooked .  in electrostatics ,",
    "the existence of both signs of charges means that both repulsive and attractive forces are possible , whereas in gravity , only positive signs of masses , and only attractive gravitational forces between masses , are observed .",
    "one consequence of this experimental fact is that whereas  it is possible to construct faraday  cages that completely screen out electrical forces , and hence electromagnetic radiation fields , it is impossible to construct gravitational analogs of such faraday cages that screen out gravitoelectric forces , such as earth s gravity .    however , the gravitomagnetic force can be either repulsive or attractive in sign , unlike the gravitoelectric force .  for example , the gravitomagnetic force between two parallel current - carrying pipes changes sign , when the direction of the current flow is reversed in one of the pipes , according to the ampere - like law eq.([ampere - like ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath309 signs of this kind of gravitational force are possible .",
    "one consequence of this is that gravitomagnetic forces @xmath310 cancel out , so that , unlike gravitoelectric fields , gravitomagnetic fields @xmath310 in principle be screened out of the interiors of material bodies .",
    "a dramatic example of this is the complete screening out of the lense - thirring field by superconductors in a meissner - like effect , i.e. , the complete expulsion of the gravitomagnetic field from the interior of these bodies , which is predicted by the ginzburg - landau theory given below in section 8 , and by the gross - pitaevskii theory for atomic becs given in appendix b.  therefore the expulsion of gravitational radiation fields by superconductors can also occur , and  thus mirrors for this kind of radiation , although counterintuitive , are not impossible .",
    "in analogy with classical electrodynamics , having obtained the impedance of free space @xmath206 , we are now in a position to calculate the time - averaged power flow in a gravitational plane through a gravitational analog of poynting s theorem in the weak - gravity limit .  the local time - averaged intensity of a gravitational plane wave is given by the time - averaged poynting - like vector@xmath311for a plane wave propagating in the vacuum , the local relationship between the magnitudes of the @xmath244 and @xmath260 fields is given by@xmath312from eq.([g]a ) , it follows that the local  time - averaged intensity , i.e. , the power per unit area , of a harmonic plane wave of angular frequency  @xmath286 is given by@xmath313for a gaussian - laguerre mode of a quadrupolar gravity - wave beam  propagating at 10 ghz with an intensity of a milliwatt per square centimeter , the velocity amplitude @xmath314 is typically@xmath315or the dimensionless strain parameter @xmath316 is typically@xmath317which is around ten orders of magnitude smaller than the typical strain amplitudes observable in the earlier versions of ligo .  at first sight , it would seem extremely difficult to detect such tiny amplitudes .",
    "however , if the natural impedance matching process in dissipationless , extreme type ii superconductors to be discussed below can be achieved in practice , then both the generation and the detection of such small strain amplitudes should not be impossible .    to give an estimate of the size of the magnetic field amplitudes which correspond to the above gravitational wave amplitudes , one uses energy conservation in a situation in which the powers in the em and gr waves become comparable to each other in the natural impedance - matching process described below , where , in the special case of perfect power conversion ( i.e. , perfect impedance matching ) from em to gr radiation,@xmath318 in the free space above the surface of the superconductor , from which it follows that @xmath319where the ratio is given by the square - root of the impedances of free space @xmath320 instead of  the mass - to - charge ratio @xmath321 ratio implied by eq.([larmor ] ) .  thus for the  above numbers@xmath322",

    "impedance matching in a natural transduction process between em and gr waves could happen near the surface of extreme type ii superconductors , where @xmath365 , and thus the electric field is screened out much more quickly on the scale of the coherence length @xmath338 , than the magnetic field , which is screened much more slowly on the scale of the penetration depth @xmath2 .",
    "the em wave impedance for extreme type ii superconductors should therefore decay on the scale of the coherence length @xmath366 much more quickly than the gr wave impedance , which should decay much more slowly on the scale of the penetration depth @xmath2 .",

    "then@xmath377this result is a robust one , in the sense that the logarithm is very insensitive to changes in numerical factors of the order of unity in its argument .  from this",
    ", we conclude that it is necessary penetrate into the superconductor a distance of  @xmath376 , which is around a hundred coherence lengths @xmath338 , for the natural impedance matching process to occur .",
    "when this happens , transducer impedance matching occurs automatically , and we expect that the conversion from electromagnetic to gravitational radiation , and vice versa , to be an efficient one .  for example , the london penetration depth of around 6000   in the case of ybco is very large compared with @xmath378400   in this material , so that the electromagnetic field energy density has not yet decayed by much at this natural impedance - matching plane @xmath379 , although it is mainly magnetic in character at this point .",
    "therefore the transducer power - conversion efficiency could be of the order of unity , provided that there is no appreciable parasitic dissipation of the em radiation fields in the superconductor before this point .",
    "the fresnel - like boundary value problem for plane waves incident on the surface of the superconductor at arbitrary incidence angles and arbitrary polarizations ( see figure [ fresnel ] ) needs to be solved in detail before these conclusions can be confirmed .",
    "however , based on the above crude dimensional and physical arguments , the prospects for a simple hertz - like experiment testing these ideas appeared promising enough that i have performed a first attempt at this experiment with walt fitelson using ybco at liquid nitrogen temperature .",
    "the schematic of this experiment is shown in figure [ hertz ] .",
    "details will be presented elsewhere .",
    "no observable signal inside the second faraday cage was detected , down to a limit of around 70 db below the microwave power source of around @xmath380 dbm at 12 ghz .",
    "( we used a commercial satellite microwave receiver at 12 ghz with a noise figure of 0.6 db to make these measurements ; the faraday cages were good enough to block any direct electromagnetic coupling by more than 70 db ) .",
    "we checked for the presence of the meissner effect in the samples _ _  in situ _ _ by observing a levitation effect upon a permanent magnet by these samples at liquid nitrogen temperature .",
    "note , however , that since the transition temperature of ybco is 90 k , there may have been a substantial ohmic dissipation of the microwaves due to the remaining normal ( unpaired ) electrons at our operating temperature of 77 k , so that the em wave was absorbed before it could reach the impedance - matching depth at @xmath376 .",
    "it may therefore be necessary to cool the superconductor down to very low temperatures before the normal electron component freezes out sufficiently to achieve such an extreme impedance matching process .",
    "the exponential decrease of the normal , unpaired electron population at very low tempertures due to the boltzmann factor @xmath381 , where @xmath382 is the bcs energy gap at very low temperatures , and thereby an exponential `` freezing out '' of the ohmic dissipation of the superconductor , may then allow this impedance matching process to take place , if no other parasitic dissipative processes remain at these very low temperatures .",
    "assuming that the impedance - matching argument given in eq.([zeta ] ) is correct , and assuming that in the normal state , the surface resistance of ybco is on the order of @xmath383 kilohms per square in its normal state , one would need a boltzmann factor of the order of @xmath384 in order to freeze out the dissipation due to the normal electrons down to an impedance level comparable to @xmath206 .",
    "this would imply that temperatures around a kelvin should suffice .",
    "however , there exist unexplained residual microwave and far - infrared losses ( of the order of 10@xmath385 ohms per square at 10 ghz ) in ybco and other high t@xmath386 superconductors , which are independent of temperature and have a frequency - squared dependence @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation is that ybco is a @xmath387-wave superconductor @xcite , which is therefore quite unlike the classic , low - temperature @xmath6-wave superconductors with respect to their microwave losses .  in @xmath387-wave superconductors",
    ", there exists a four - fold symmetry of nodal lines along which the  bcs gap vanishes @xcite .",
    "hence it would be impossible to freeze out the normal , ohmic component of unpaired electrons along these nodal lines by means of the boltzmann factor , which makes the choice of ybco for the hertz - like experiment a bad one .",
    "a better choice of superconductor would have been a classic , @xmath6-wave , extreme type - ii superconductor , such as a niobium alloy which has an isotropic bcs gap .",
    "for such a superconductor , the ratio of penetration depth to coherence length in the `` extreme dirty limit '' is given by de gennes @xcite@xmath388where @xmath389 is the mean free path for electron scattering .  for a niobium alloy with @xmath390   and @xmath391  , it follows that @xmath392 .",
    "thus impedance matching down to the extremely low value of @xmath206 , as given in eq.([z_g ] ) , would still be possible .  however",
    ", for achieving such  an extreme impedance matching process , one would still need a boltzmann factor of the order of @xmath384 , and therefore it would be necessary to cool the niobium alloy superconductor down to very low temperatures , e.g. , tens of millikelvins , before the normal , ohmic electron component would freeze out sufficiently , but more research needs first to be done to determine whether microwave residual losses can indeed be exponentially suppressed by such a large exponential factor .",
    "an improved hertz - like experiment using extreme type ii superconductors with extremely low losses , perhaps at millikelvin temperatures , is a much more difficult , but worthwhile , experiment to perform .",
    "such an improved experiment , if successful , would allow us to communicate through the earth and its oceans , which , like all classical matter , are transparent to gr waves .  furthermore , it would allow us to directly observe for the first time the cmb ( cosmic microwave background ) in gr radiation , which would tell us much about the very early universe .",
    "the conceptual tensions between qm and gr , the two main fields of interest of john archibald wheeler , could indeed lead to important experimental consequences , much like the conceptual tensions of the past .",
    "i have covered here in detail only one of these conceptual tensions , namely , the tension between the concept of spatial nonseparability of physical systems due to the notion of nonlocality embedded in the superposition principle , in particular , in the entangled states of qm , and the concept of spatial separability of all physical systems due to the notion of locality embedded in the equivalence principle in gr .",

    "there seems to be no experimental evidence against the existence of such a quantum source term , and , indeed , the hess - fairbank effect ( see below ) may be evidence for its existence .  the implications of the kramers - kronig relations in light of this result would need further exploration .    by contrast , if one were to insist on setting the gravitomagnetic susceptibility @xmath448 equal to zero , so that @xmath471 , i.e. , that such a quantum source term does not exist , then due to the sign change in the source term of the ampere - like equation eq.(staticampere - like ) , one would obtain a",

    "the helmholtz - like equation eq.([helmholtz - like ] ) possesses sinusoidal , propagative solutions , rather than exponential , evanescent solutions of the yukawa - like equation eq.([yukawa - like ] ) , so that no meissner - like effect would exist at all , even in astrophysical settings .",
    "therefore any quantum fluid , including superfluid helium and atomic becs , would never satisfy , under any circumstances involving gravitational radiation , the irrotational condition @xmath444 @xcite : this would lead to a violation of the single - valuedness of @xmath323 , in contradiction with qm .",
    "there may already be an experimental hint of the existence of a strong meissner - like effect in the case of superfluid helium .",
    "the hess - fairbank experiment @xcite is an analog of the meissner effect seen in a slowly rotating bucket of liquid helium as it is slowly cooled through the lambda transition temperature , in which the angular momentum of the fluid is @xmath476 from the superfluid below this transition .",
    "this may be viewed as evidence for a true meissner - like effect , in which the lense - thirring field from distant matter in the universe is expelled .  from an application of the limited form of mach s principle in gr using the lense - thirring effect from distant , rotating shells of stars @xcite",
    ", it follows that the parabolic meniscus of any steadily rotating classical fluid , including that of normal liquid helium above the transition temperature , is actually a consequence of the presence of the lense - thirring field from this distant matter .  the hess - fairbank effect",
    "could then be reinterpreted as a true meissner - like effect , in which the lense - thirring field of these distant stars is actually expelled .  moreover",
    ", one could interpret this effect as evidence for a violation of the `` extended '' equivalence principle discussed in section 6 , since the response of a quantum fluid ( viz .",
    ", superfluid helium ) to the lense - thirring field of distant matter is obviously different from the  composition - independent , parabolic - meniscus response of all classical fluids .",
    "one implication is that the parabolic meniscus should become a flat meniscus below this thermodynamic transition , except for a thin layer of thickness @xmath477 , which , in general , differs from @xmath338 .",
    "it should be possible to measure the curvature of the surface of the rotating fluid by reflecting a laser beam from it .",
    "the flattening on the meniscus of rotating liquid helium below the lambda point of a slowly rotating bucket of this liquid , as it is slowly cooled through the lambda transition , can be observed by means of laser interferometry @xcite .",
    "the flat meniscus also predicted by eq.([generalized gross - pitaevskii equation ] ) for the slowly rotating bucket of superfluid helium below the transition temperature implies that this quantum fluid below its transition temperature should become a _ plane mirror _ for gravitational radiation",
    ". however , there is no way of knowing this without a source and detector of such radiation .",
