    "the possibility of excitonic condensation ( ec ) in metallic systems was originally proposed by keldysh and kopaev  @xcite for semimetals with overlapping conduction and valence bands .",
    "they have shown that the attractive coulomb interaction between electrons and holes leads to an instability towards formation of bound electron - hole pairs analogous to the cooper instability in superconductors .",
    "somewhat later , it was suggested  @xcite that ec could be realized in a double - layer system of spatially separated electrons and holes .",
    "experimental efforts towards the observation of ec were mainly concentrated on semiconductor double quantum well systems  @xcite and experimental data speak in favor of the existence of ec in electron - hole bilayers  @xcite and electron - electron bilayers in the quantum hall regime  @xcite .    since the carrier density in graphene , including its polarity , can effectively be controlled by various means , graphene - based systems may also seem attractive for the realization of ec . indeed ,",
    "several ideas on how one could obtain ec in graphene have been suggested recently .",
    "one possible way to create interacting electrons and holes is to apply a strong in - plane magnetic field to a single layer of graphene  @xcite .",
    "such a magnetic field acts on the spins of the carriers only , and the zeeman splitting creates electrons with one spin polarization and holes with the opposite polarization in an initially neutral sample .",
    "a detailed theory of ec in such a setup has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    a double - layer graphene system ( fig .  [ fig : system ] ) as a candidate for the observation of ec",
    "was proposed recently in refs .",
    "if two graphene layers are separated by an insulator , electrons in one layer and holes in the other can be obtained by applying external gate voltage .",
    "relatively high values of the fermi energy @xmath3 that can be achieved in graphene by using gates  @xcite are an obvious advantage , since @xmath4 serves as a high - energy scale of the effect in such a setup . solving the gap equations numerically , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite provided an estimate @xmath5 for the critical temperature of the berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition and argued that @xmath6 could thus reach room temperatures .",
    "however , in the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , the screening of the coulomb interactions by the carriers in the graphene layers was not taken into account . clearly , the two - dimensional screening cloud formed around a probe charge in a graphene sheet screens the field of the charge both in the off - plane and in - plane directions , although not identically .",
    "therefore , screening affects not only the intralayer but also the interlayer coulomb interaction in the double - layer setup .    in this paper , we demonstrate that taking screening into account is essential as it drastically reduces the transition temperature compared to the estimate obtained in refs  @xcite neglecting screening .",
    "in fact , screening sets the upper bound for the interaction strength , yielding for the maximum possible value of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath7here @xmath8 is the total number of electron species in the system originating from two projections of spin ( @xmath9 ) , two valleys ( @xmath10 ) , and two layers ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "moreover , the chiral nature of quasiparticles in graphene leads to the suppression of backscattering .",
    "consequently , the maximum interaction strength @xmath12 that determines the transition temperature appears to be actually two times smaller than @xmath13 , @xmath14    as follows from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lamax ] ) and ( [ eq : lamaxbcs ] ) , the large number of electron species and suppression of backscattering make the maximum possible value @xmath12 of the interaction strength numerically quite small .",
    "this justifies the applicability of the weak - coupling bcs approach to the problem , since 1/16 can safely be considered as a small parameter . as a result , for the highest possible value of the mean - field transition temperature",
    "we obtain @xmath15this is the _",
    "highest possible _ value of the critical temperature of the excitonic condensation that could be achieved in a perfectly clean double - layer graphene system .",
    "entering eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcmax ] ) as the exponent , the large value of the inverse interaction strength @xmath16 results in a drastic reduction of the transition temperature . in order to achieve the maximum value ( [ eq : tcmax ] ) , the interlayer distance @xmath17 must be much smaller than the debye screening length @xmath18 , @xmath19the most optimistic estimate would thus be @xmath20 for @xmath21 and would require @xmath22 .",
    "we now present the details of derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcmax ] ) .",
    "the bare strength of coulomb interactions in graphene is not that small . for sio@xmath23 used as an insulator embedding graphene sheets , typical values of the dimensionless coupling constant",
    "are @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is the dielectric constant of the insulator and @xmath26 is the velocity of the dirac spectrum , we set @xmath27 throughout this section ) .",
    "this questions the applicability of the weak - coupling approach to the problem of ec , suggesting , at the same time , that the transition temperature could be quite high  @xcite .",
    "it is known , however , that in a fermionic system with a large number @xmath28 of independent fermionic species the interactions are significantly weakened .",
    "physically , large @xmath29 makes screening very effective , since _ all _",
    "@xmath29 species participate in the screening of interactions between fermions of _ each _ particular species .",
    "screening reduces the coupling constant from @xmath30 to the value @xmath31 : @xmath32 . effectively , the system becomes weakly interacting , despite of the fact that the bare coulomb interactions may be not weak ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the large-@xmath29 approximation was already used for a single - layer graphene  @xcite before . in a single layer",
    ", the number of species is equal to @xmath34 due to two projections of spin ( @xmath9 ) and two valleys ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this value is not exceptionally large , but does give hope that the large-@xmath29 approach adequately describes graphene physics . in a double - layer system",
    "the situation is better : since each electron can belong to either one of the layers , one has an additional `` which - layer '' degree of freedom ( @xmath11 ) making the total number of species @xmath35",
    ". it would already be quite reasonable to treat @xmath36 as a large parameter .",
    "therefore , large-@xmath29 approximation seems to be particularly suitable for a double - layer graphene system and is expected to provide good quantitative predictions .    below we employ the large-@xmath29 approach to the double - layer graphene system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] ) treating @xmath36 as a large parameter and calculate the mean - field critical temperature @xmath37 of ec .",
    "the calculations follow closely those of ref .  @xcite .",
    "of course , the mean - field treatment of two - dimensional systems is not necessarily a good one due to strong thermal fluctuations .",
    "it is , however , sufficient for our purposes , as our main goal is to demonstrate that already the mean - field critical temperature is extremely low .",
    "the temperature @xmath6 of the actual bkt transition can only be lower than the mean - field @xmath37 we calculate here .    within the large-@xmath29 approximation , the diagrammatic series for the effective interaction between the electrons is identical to that of the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , which describes linear screening .",
    "for the problem at hand , the relevant transfer momenta @xmath38 are in the range @xmath39 , with @xmath40 the fermi momentum , and one has to use the exact expression for the polarization operator ( and not its limit form for @xmath41 ) .",

( [ eq : lamaxbcs ] ) ] due to the absence of the valley space and chirality .",
    "this value is not that small and the system could be on the verge of the weak - coupling limit .",
    "therefore , one does not get such a small value of the transition temperature as we obtained for graphene .",
    "it is also instructive to mention for comparison that in a single - layer graphene subject to the in - plane magnetic field  @xcite one obtains @xmath99 for the interaction constant , since the system consists of only one layer ( @xmath100 ) [ see eq .",
    "( 5.29b ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ] , and the exponential factor @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcmax ] ) is not as small .",

    "( [ eq : tcmax ] ) instead of @xmath4 , which can not be extremely high even for experimentally very high magnetic fields @xmath102 . for @xmath103",
    "one can estimate @xmath104 .",
    "there is another factor that is unfavorable for the realization of ec in double - layer systems .",
    "namely , the excitonic condensate is sensitive to the impurity scattering  @xcite .",
    "since the bound electron and hole carry the same momentum @xmath105 , any scattering process that changes the momentum of electron and hole not identically , i.e. , @xmath106 for electron and @xmath107 for hole , so that @xmath108 , breaks the electron - hole pair ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : scattering ] ) .",
    "this is the case for any impurities with the range of the scattering potential less than the interlayer distance @xmath17 , since the potential of such impurities differs in the two layers .",
    "the effect of the impurity scattering on the excitonic condensate was studied analytically for conventional systems in refs .",
    "zittartz , ly and the theory is analogous to abrikosov - gorkov s theory for magnetic impurities in superconductors .",
    "this approach has been very recently applied to graphene in ref .",
    "the main result of this study is that sufficiently short - range impurities with the scattering time @xmath109 destroy the excitonic condensate completely as soon as @xmath110where @xmath37 is the transition temperature of the ideally clean system .",
    "equivalently , for the condensate to exist , electron momentum has to be conserved at the scale of the correlation length @xmath111 . since the mean free path @xmath112 of the order of the typical size of graphene samples corresponds to @xmath113 , considering the values @xmath114 obtained ,",
    "the condensate should be completely suppressed at any temperature @xmath115 even in the ballistic samples due to the boundary scattering .    in conclusion , we have studied the possibility of the excitonic condensation in double - layer graphene systems .",
    "we have demonstrated that in order to properly determine the transition temperature , it is essential to take the screening of the coupling interlayer coulomb interaction into account .",
    "the specifics of the graphene spectrum ( chirality and valley degrees of freedom ) leads to a smaller interaction strength than in conventional semiconductors and to an extremely small value @xmath116 of the transition temperature .",
