    "we present @xmath1co  ( @xmath2 ) observations towards the ( 36 @xmath7 ) class  i protostar elias  29 ( @xmath8 [ j2000.0 ] ) located in the @xmath3  ophiuchi star forming region .",
    "the @xmath3-oph cloud complex is nearby ( @xmath9pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and has a diverse ( proto-)stellar environment that makes it a superb laboratory for studying the impact of molecular outflows on the surrounding environment .",
    "the region around elias  29 is a particularly well - studied component of the cloud complex .",
    "two foreground clouds at @xmath10  km@xmath11s@xmath12 and @xmath13  km@xmath11s@xmath12 account for the presence of cool ice along the line of sight and absorb much of the blue - shifted outflow emission in this region @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite identified a ridge of dense material at @xmath14  km@xmath11s@xmath12 within which both elias  29 and lfam  26 reside .",
    "obtained spectra of the @xmath1co  ( @xmath15 ) transition with the jcmt and the @xmath16 co levels with the iso sws towards elias  29 .",
    "these authors found evidence for a super - heated surface disk layer with a temperature and mass similar to that found in herbig aebe stars @xcite , suggesting that elias  29 may be a deeply embedded herbig aebe star or a transition object between the standard class  i and class  ii types . reported the discovery of an outflow around elias  29 and",
    "estimated its momentum rate .",
    "a larger map of the region was made in the @xmath1co  ( @xmath17 ) transition by @xcite .    in this paper , we present @xmath1co  ( @xmath2 ) observations that further expand the size of the mapped region and reaffirm the bipolar nature of the outflow , but find that it is more extended than previously thought . furthermore , the map has sufficient size to identify a previously undiscovered outflow whose source appears to be lfam  26 .",
    "first discovered as a radio source @xcite , lfam  26 was later identified as a low luminosity ( @xmath18 ) class  i protostar based on isocam photometry .",
    "the extreme faintness of this source , coupled with the detection of molecular outflows presented in this paper , make it a candidate vello",
    ". however , detailed modeling of the infrared sed will be necessary to determine if this object meets the primary criterion of @xmath19 .",
    "we made a 5@xmath0 @xmath1co  ( @xmath2 ) on - the - fly map centered spectrally at 345.795975 ghz and spatially on elias  29 using the 10 m heinrich hertz telescope ( hht ) on mt .",
    "graham , arizona during april 2001 and january 2006 .",
    "a 256 channel filterbank spectrometer with 250  khz resolution was used as the backend in 2001 , and two 2048 channel acousto - optical spectrometers ( aos ) with 475  khz resolution were used in 2006 . the off - position for both maps",
    "was located at a clean offset @xcite of @xmath20 from elias  29 .",
    "we obtained two rows of data per off , translating to @xmath211 off observation per minute for a 10@xmath22 per second scan rate .",
    "each row is offset in declination by 10@xmath22 . at 345  ghz ,",
    "the half - power telescope beamsize and main beam efficiency were measured to be 22@xmath22 and 0.7 , respectively .",
    "pointing accuracy of a few arcseconds was maintained by observing planets approximately once per hour .",
    "the otf data grid was convolved with an 11@xmath22 beam to obtain a nyquist - sampled map .",
    "system temperatures during the observing run were 500 - 1500  k. line strengths were calibrated using hot and cold loads in conjunction with sky measurements at the off position @xcite .",
    "calibration uncertainty is estimated to be @xmath23% .",
    "for both datasets , the main beam temperature ( @xmath24 ) showed a typical rms noise level of 0.7  k .",
    "the 2001 data are smoothed in velocity space to match the 0.4  km  s@xmath12 bins of the 2006 data .",
    "the final datacube used in the analysis is an rms - weighted average of the two datasets and has a typical rms noise temperature of @xmath25  k.",
    "in figure  [ fig : spectra ] , we show spectra located at the driving sources as well as at the approximate peak of the integrated emission intensity in the blue and red lobes of both outflows .",
    "the vertical lines demarcate the position in velocity space of intervening absorption clouds along the line of sight at @xmath26  km@xmath11s@xmath12 and @xmath13  km@xmath11s@xmath12 , as well as a ridge of material at @xmath27  km@xmath11s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "each of the spectra show signs of significant absorption due to these intervening clouds .",
    "figure  [ fig : intensitycontours ] shows the integrated intensity map of the blue - shifted ( solid contours , @xmath28 to 1 km  s@xmath12 ) and red - shifted ( dashed contours , @xmath29 to 12 km  s@xmath12 ) outflow emission .",
    "the velocity ranges have been chosen to avoid the absorption features from the intervening clouds detected by @xcite .",
    "crosses show the location of elias  29 and lfam  26 , plus signs indicate the position of infrared sources @xcite , squares represent starless cores , and the diamonds show h@xmath4 emission knots observed by ( feature g2 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and by ( features 1 - 3b * ? ? ?",
    "elias  29 is associated with emission towards the north ( blue - shifted ) and south ( red - shifted ) , consistent with results from previous outflow surveys that have suggested a bipolar outflow with a mostly pole - on inclination @xcite .",
    "the large scale outflow morphology strongly resembles the s - shaped symmetry observed in h@xmath4 emission near the driving source @xcite , with the blue lobe bending to the northeast and the red lobe bending to the southwest .",
    "the solid curve through the peaks of the elias  29 blue and red lobes represents our best estimate of the outflow axis and is weighted by eye towards the five h@xmath4 emission knots labelled as features 1 , 2a , 2b , 3a , and 3b @xcite in the main panel of figure  [ fig : intensitycontours ] .",
    "the bottom right inset is reproduced from @xcite and shows the structure of the region as seen in h@xmath4 emission .",
    "regions @xmath30 and @xmath31 appear to trace the peak of the red - shifted outflow emission . mapped co  ( @xmath15 ) line emission over a @xmath32 field centered on elias  29 with an effective beamsize of @xmath33 .",
    "contour maps of their observed wing emission show evidence in support of an east - west outflow axis , consistent with the s - shaped symmetry found by @xcite and seen in the central regions of our map .",
    "higher spatial resolution observations will be necessary to explore the detailed morphology of the central region of outflow emission from elias  29 and provide a more precise comparison with the known h@xmath4 regions .",
    "in addition to the well - studied outflow from elias  29 , we report a new outflow whose source appears to be lfam  26 , a class  i protostar located @xmath211@xmath34 northwest of elias  29 .",
    "the morphology of this outflow  with lobes to the east and west both showing significant red - shifted emission  suggests that its axis lies near the plane of the sky , as shown by the solid line in figure  [ fig : intensitycontours ] .",
    "the relatively low level of blue - shifted emission from this outflow is most likely due to the presence of the foreground absorbing clouds at @xmath26  km@xmath11s@xmath12 and @xmath35  km@xmath11s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the @xmath36  km@xmath11s@xmath12 cloud is roughly spatially coincident with the eastern lobe of the lfam  26 outflow .",
    "emission detected within the contours of the integrated emission intensity to the east @xcite lends further support to the notion of lfam  26 as the driving source . the outflow axis as drawn lies nearly a full beamwidth away from [ gswc2003 ]  2 , a knot of h@xmath4 emission detected by @xcite .",
    "these authors attributed the h@xmath4 knot to the elias  29 outflow , but in our co  ( @xmath2 ) wing map , the western lobe of the lfam  26 outflow appears to lie between lfam  26 and [ gswc2003 ]  2 , suggesting that lfam  26 is a more likely candidate than elias  29 to be the powering source of the h@xmath4 knot .",
    "it must be kept in mind that this is a particularly dense region of @xmath3-oph which makes the association of outflows with their driving sources particularly problematic . for this reason , additional evidence linking lfam  26 and",
    "the observed outflows is desirable .",
    "this evidence comes in the form of nebulous emission seen in deep nir imaging of lfam  26 that has a distinct hourglass shape  shown in the top right inset of figure  [ fig : intensitycontours ] with the nebulosity extending a few arcseconds away on either side of the central source .",
    "the orientation of the hourglass roughly coincides with the @xmath21100@xmath37 outflow position angle we estimated above , serving as further evidence that lfam  26 is the powering source of the observed outflow .",
    "the hourglass shape around lfam  26 is consistent with the presence of an edge - on accretion disk .",
    "whether or not lfam  26 qualifies as a vello must await detailed modeling of its ir sed , a task which is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "it should be noted that the integrated emission intensity peaks do not appear to lie directly on the outflow axis as shown in figure  [ fig : intensitycontours ] . due to the masking effect of foreground clouds",
    ", the redshifted emission components alone may not accurately portray the east - west spatial centroids of the outflow .",
    "nevertheless , let us consider the possibility of alternative driving source(s ) .",
    "first , the object closest to lfam  26 is e - mm3 , located @xmath2115@xmath22 east and @xmath2130@xmath22 south of lfam  26 .",
    "this object was first labelled as a starless core , but subsequent vlt h and ks observations showed a bipolar reflection nebulosity surrounding it in much the same manner as lfam  26 . however , the orientation of this reflection nebula is closer to north / south than east / west and is therefore an unlikely candidate for the driving source .",
    "another possibility is that each of the outflows is driven by one of the other embedded objects either in this region ( e.g. e - mm4 or e - mm5 ) or beyond . given the highly obscured , complex structure of the region , this scenario is plausible . finally , it is conceivable that elias  29 is a binary system , with the other object producing the observed outflow .",
    "however , numerous searches using a wide variety of techniques from lunar occultations @xcite to deep nir imaging have found no evidence for a companion .",
    "physical parameters of each outflow are summarized in table  [ tab : results ] . from the integrated intensity map ,",
    "we estimate the maximum radius ( @xmath38 ) and area ( @xmath39 ) of each outflow lobe centered on the position of peak flux . here",
    "the characteristic velocity of each outflow , @xmath40 , is the maximum outflow velocity detected in the associated @xmath1co  ( @xmath2 ) spectra , @xmath41 .",
    "the dynamical timescale is @xmath42 .",
    "we assume the wings of the @xmath1co  ( @xmath2 ) emission are optically thin , so the values in table  [ tab : results ] represent lower limits to the actual values . as mentioned in section  [ sec : morph ] , however , there is evidence of strong absorption of the blue - shifted outflow emission from lfam  26 due to the presence of foreground absorption clouds .",
    "furthermore , the measured radial velocity underestimates the characteristic velocity by a factor of @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the inclination angle . if the outflow axis of lfam  26 is near the plane of the sky , then @xmath44 approaches 0@xmath37 and the correction factor can increase significantly .    from the peak main beam temperature in the @xmath1co",
    "( @xmath2 ) spectrum , we estimate @xmath45k . while @xmath46 is not constant across the map , the variations are small and do not significantly affect the results .",
    "for instance , if we assume a @xmath46 that is smaller by a factor of 2 , we find average column densities that are roughly a factor of 2 larger .",
    "the total co column density , @xmath47 , is calculated from @xcite under the assumption of lte .",
    "assuming dark cloud abundances of [ h@xmath4]/[co]@xmath49 , we estimate the mass of each outflow lobe to be @xmath50h@xmath4/[co])@xmath47@xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the mean atomic weight of the gas , 1.36 @xcite .",
    "the mass outflow rate is @xmath53 , the outflow momentum is @xmath54 and the outflow force is @xmath55 .",
    "the mechanical luminosity is estimated as @xmath56 .",
    "the outflow to infall conversion efficiency is @xmath57 .",
    "@xcite and have obtained integrated intensity @xmath1co  ( @xmath17 ) emission maps centered on elias  29 .",
    "the @xmath1co  ( @xmath58 ) map shown here represents a significant enlargement of the surveyed area . inside the mapped region",
    ", we find a larger radius for the blue lobe of elias  290.058  pc compared to 0.024  pc in @xcite .",
    "we also find an average column density over the elias  29 outflow that is a factor of @xmath21@xmath59 lower than observed in @xmath1co  ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the difference in column density estimates may be due to the @xmath1co  ( @xmath60 ) wing emission being optically thick . our optically thin assumption would then underestimate the true column density by a factor of @xmath61 . due to the extended size of the outflow region , the @xmath1co  ( @xmath2 )",
    "derived outflow mass is comparable to that of @xcite .",
    "the outflow energetics are summarized in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the low values of the energetic parameters associated with elias 29 suggest it is near the end of its outflow / accretion phase , consistent with the findings of .",
    "we present a 25 square arcminute map of @xmath1co  ( @xmath2 ) outflow emission centered on elias  29 . in the map , we see evidence suggesting the elias  29 outflow is bipolar and has a curved flow that traces the same structure seen in h@xmath4 line emission .",
    "we report the first detection of a molecular outflow from lfam  26 , an object whose low luminosity makes it a candidate vello . while the high density of protostellar objects in this region produces a complicated outflow structure that makes associating outflows with their driving sources somewhat problematic",
    ", we conclude lfam  26 is the most likely driving source . both the molecular outflow and the nir scattered",
    "light cavity morphology suggests the associated outflow axis lies near the plane of the sky , in which case we are viewing the protostar through an edge - on accretion disk .",
    "we calculate lower limits on the mechanical luminosity of the outflows from elias  29 and lfam  26 to be 6.4 and 10.3  @xmath62 , respectively .",
