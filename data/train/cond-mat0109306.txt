    "the knowledge of the structures of impurities and defects is an essential prerequisite for understanding the electrical and optical changes that these complexes induce in semiconductors such as crystalline silicon@xcite .",
    "the presence of light impurities such as h , b , c or o , results in the appearance of infra - red ( ir ) or raman active local vibrational modes ( lvms ) usually well isolated from the frequency range of the phonons of the host material .",
    "the observation of lvms coupled with isotope substitutions and uniaxial stress measurements provide precious information about the type and number of impurity atoms involved and the symmetry of the defect",
    ". however , these data are rarely sufficient to identify unambiguously the defect .",
    "since the early days of stein@xcite , a large number of vibrational modes have been identified through the interplay of experiment and theory .    the calculation of lvms at the _ ab - initio _ level provides a critical link between theory and experiment .",
    "this is particulary true in the case of hydrogen , since it binds covalently in the immediate vicinity of many impurities and defects thus giving rise to a number of lvms in the range @xmath0 800 to @xmath02200 @xmath1 .",
    "other common impurities in si which produce lvms are b , c , o , but any element lighter than si can in principle be observed by lvm spectroscopy .",
    "the computation of systematically accurate vibrational frequencies is a challenge for first principles theory , given their sensitivity on details of bonding geometry and electronic structure .",
    "typical accuracies in the calculated vibrational modes for light impurities in silicon in former works are within 3 - 10%  of the experimental data , which means in some cases a deviation of over 100 @xmath1 .",
    "various approaches have been used to calculate lvms , from semiempirical models@xcite , to _ ab - initio _ hartree - fock@xcite and density functional theory@xcite . in most cases ,",
    "frequencies are calculated in the spirit of the _ frozen phonon _ approximation .",
    "one computes the total energy of the system in the equilibrium configuration ( that in which the forces acting on the atoms are zero ) and then for small displacements of selected atoms ( either individually or in the direction of a normal mode , if this is known ) .",
    "the actual value of the atomic displacement ( typically a few hundredths of an  ) and the response of the nearby atoms are parameters chosen by the user .",
    "one can either fit the energy vs. displacement to a polynomial and extract a specific vibrational mode@xcite , or compute the dynamical matrix by finite differences@xcite .",
    "when a few specific modes is all that is needed , only the movement of the atoms involved in those modes is considered . in these methods , it is not possible to completely isolate the harmonic contributions from the anharmonic ones , since finite displacements always involve some anharmonic effects .",
    "for this reason , the frequencies obtained in this approach are sometimes referred to as _ quasi - harmonic_@xcite .",
    "one can also calculate vibrational properties from constant - temperature molecular - dynamics simulations , for instance by extracting selected frequencies from the velocity - velocity autocorrelation function@xcite or by using more sofisticated spectral estimators , like the multiple signal classification ( music ) algorithm.@xcite this is computationally exhausting , since long molecular dynamics runs are required , but potentially very accurate.@xcite this also allows the calculation of frequencies as a function of temperature .",
    "however , the calculation of vibrational frequencies does not neccesarily require the actual displacement of the atoms , as in the methods described above .",
    "linear response theory ( in particular through the application of perturbation theory in density functional theory ) has been thoroughly used in the past@xcite to compute the response of the system to infinitesimal atomic displacements , and from that , the vibrational frequencies in the harmonic approximation .",
    "this can be done with the only knowledge of the electronic solution in the equilibrium configuration .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that anharmonic effects are elliminated , and that no reference is needed to explicit finite atomic displacements .",
    "besides , this approach allows to compute phonons with arbitrary * q * vector in crystalline systems , without having to consider a supercell conmensurate with the periodicity of the phonon , as it is required in the frozen phonon and molecular dynamics approaches .",
    "we propose a method , based on density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) , to compute vibrational frequencies in the harmonic approximation .",
    "we use a basis set of numerical atomic orbitals to expand the electronic wavefunctions , which makes the method computationally very efficient , and allows us to calculate systems with a large number of atoms .",
    "we have applied it to make a systematic study of a number of defect centers in silicon , involving light impurities and their complexes with intrinsic defects ( vacancies and self - interstitials ) . in most cases ,",
    "the comparison of the calculated and measured vibrational frequencies is very favorable , improving on the results obtained by other approaches .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we first discuss the theoretical method and the model used to describe the defects .",
    "then we compare the vibrational properties obtained for a variety of complexes with experimental data as well as other first - principles calculations in the literature .",
    "finally , we discuss the results .",
    "in this work , we use the fully self - consistent _ ab - initio _ code siesta@xcite .",
    "the electronic energy is obtained from density - functional theory ( dft)@xcite within the local density approximation .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential is that of ceperley - alder@xcite as parameterized by perdew and zunger.@xcite norm - conserving pseudopotentials@xcite in the kleinman - bylander form@xcite are used to remove the core electrons from the calculations .",
    "the valence electron wavefunctions are described with numerical linear combinations of atomic orbitals ( lcao ) of the sankey type,@xcite but generalized to be arbitrarily complete with the inclusion of multiple - zeta orbitals and polarization states.@xcite these orbitals are numerical solutions of the free atom with the appropriate pseudopotential , and are extrictly zero beyond some cutoff radius .",
    "this makes the calculation of the kohn - sham hamiltonian to scale linearly with the number of atoms,@xcite allowing calculations in very large systems with a modest computational cost .    in the present work ,",
    "the basis sets include single - zeta ( sz ) , double - zeta ( dz ) , double - zeta plus polarization ( dzp ) , and triple - zeta plus polarization ( tzp ) .",
    "a dzp basis includes two sets of @xmath2 and @xmath3 s plus one set of @xmath4 s on si , o , c or b , two @xmath2 s and one set of @xmath3 s on h. the radial cutoff of the atomic orbitals was determined as described in ref .",
    ", with an energy shift of 0.5 ry , and a split - norm of 0.15 for all the species except h , for which the split - norm was 0.5 .",
    "the charge density is projected on a real space grid with an equivalent cutoff of 90 to 150@xmath5 to calculate the exchange - correlation and hartree potentials .",
    "the host crystal is represented by a periodic supercell of 64 host atoms , and the * k*-point sampling is reduced to the @xmath6 point .",
    "this restriction appears to be quite sufficient for the calculation of vibrational spectra .",
    "tests have been performed for selected defects in a 128 host atoms cell and the results are within a few wavenumbers of those obtained in the 64 host atoms cell .    in order to determine the equilibrium structure of the defects studied , we have relaxed all the atomic coordinates with a conjugate gradient algorithm , reaching a tolerance in the forces of f@xmath70.01ev /  . the dynamical matrix for the whole cell is computed ( see below ) from this ground state and its eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes obtained .      a new implementation of dfpt has been developed to compute the electronic response to _ infinitesimal _ atomic displacements .",
    "as is well known from the `` @xmath8 '' theorem in quantum mechanics,@xcite the first - order change of the electronic wavefunction in a perturbative expansion allows the computation of the second - order change in the energies .",
    "this implies that only the properties of the unperturbed ground state are needed to obtain the linear response of the system .",
    "the extension of this theorem to dft is that the knowledge of the first - order change in the electronic density determines variationally the second - order change in the energy . in this way",
    ", we obtain analytically the dynamical matrix from the gradient of the density relative to atomic displacement and , from it , the vibrational properties , without physically displacing any atom .",
    "we describe briefly here the key points of our formulation .",
    "a complete report will be published elsewhere.@xcite the change in the electronic wavefunction is obtained by solving the first - order perturbation expansion of the schrdinger equation ( sternheimer equation@xcite ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 are the ground state electronic wavefunctions and @xmath11 the first order perturbation of @xmath12 when an atom is displaced ( if we consider atom @xmath13 , this would be @xmath14 ) . as we expand these wave functions in terms of atomic orbitals : @xmath15 the derivatives can be directly written in terms of the derivatives of the atomic orbitals : @xmath16\\>.\\ ] ] only the orbitals @xmath17 centered on atom @xmath13 appear in the last term which is equal to @xmath18 .",
    "the change in the coefficients , @xmath19 , is obtained from equation [ sternheimer ] .",
    "@xmath20 is then used to compute the perturbation in the electronic density @xmath21\\>.\\ ] ] this allows the computation of the dynamical matrix , by explicit derivation of the forces on all the atoms @xmath22 in the system ( the expressions of which can be found in refs . and for our approach ) with respect to the infinitesimal desplacement of one of them ( @xmath13 ) : @xmath23 we remark that only terms up to first order in the electronic wavefunctions appear in the resulting formulas .",
    "note that only the linear effects are obtained in this method , which is consistent with the harmonic approximation implicitly assumed in the diagonalization of the dynamical matrix .",
    "thus , one expects to obtain high - quality frequencies for the vibrational modes that are harmonic , but the frequencies of modes involving large anharmonic contributions will be less accurate .",
    "although phonons with arbitrary * q * vector can be obtained in the pressent approach , here we only calculate vibrations which are periodic with the simulation supercell ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath24 ) , since we are interested in lvms .",
    "tests of the method for free sih@xmath25 , co , co@xmath26 and h@xmath27 lead to very good agreement with experiment ( see table [ molecules ] ) . using an appropriate basis set reveals to be essential to reproduce accurate frequencies . in most of the cases",
    "a dz set gives good values , but in some configurations a more complete basis is required .",
    "this is particularly true for bending modes .",
    "oxygen likes to have polarization orbitals , and thus the frequencies are better when these are included .",
    "note that the vibrational frequencies are more sensitive to the basis set size than the structural properties , such as bond lengths .",
    "in general , the largest improvements in the frequencies correspond to going from sz to dz , then dz to dzp , but tz basis produce only marginal improvements .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]",
    "we have presented a new development of dfpt , using localized atomic wavefunctions as a basis set , and applied it to the study of lvms for light impurities in silicon .",
    "in contrast to other methods , the dynamical matrix is computed analytically without actually displacing any atom from its equilibrium position .",
    "the calculations are based on the ground state density matrix as computed with the siesta package .",
    "tests of the method for free molecules ( sih@xmath25 , h@xmath26 , co , and co@xmath26 ) show that this approach is highly accurate in situations where the anharmonic contributions are small .",
    "note that the frequencies are obtained at @xmath28 while experimental data are obtained at low , but non - zero , temperatures .",
    "we have used a variety of basis set sizes to describe the electronic wavefunctions . in most cases ,",
    "a dz basis is quite sufficient to obtain accurate atomic structures and vibrational frequencies .",
    "larger basis sets such as dzp improve the frequencies in situations that involve more complex chemical bondings . the defects included here",
    "are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( with n=1,2,3,4 ) , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , the @xmath35 pair , substitutional c , interstitial o and two charge states of the a center .",
    "these defects involve a wide range of bonding configurations .",
    "the average error of the  60 calculated modes relative to experiment is about 2% . in situations",
    "where large anharmonic contributions are present , the accuracy of the method decreases somewhat ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this occurs , for example , when h is close to a bc position .",
    "however , in most cases the calculated frequencies are in remarkable agreement ( 0 to 2% ) with experimental data , implying that this perturbative approach is totally justified and that the ground state density matrix calculated with siesta is very reliable .",
