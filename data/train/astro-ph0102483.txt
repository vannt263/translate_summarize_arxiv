    "_ rosat _  observations showed that the coma cluster , once thought to be an archetype of a relaxed system , contains substructures on a wide range of linear scales ( briel , henry & bhringer  1992 , white , briel & henry  1993 , vikhlinin , forman & jones 1997 ) .",
    "the detected structures include 100  kpc - scale x - ray enhancements around the two dominant cluster galaxies , ngc4874 and ngc4889 ( vikhlinin , forman , & jones  1994 ) .",
    "recent xmm observations confirmed these findings and also revealed unresolved x - ray sources coincident with these galaxies ( arnaud et al .",
    "2001 , briel et al .",
    "2001 ) . in this _ letter _",
    ", we resolve these sources with _ chandra_. both sources are extended arcsec - scale ( @xmath1  kpc ) remnants of galactic x - ray coronae with temperatures 12  kev , compressed by the hot , 9  kev , gas of the coma cluster .",
    "their very existence poses interesting physical questions .",
    "the problem of thermal evaporation of cold clouds embedded in a hot medium has been considered in a number of papers ( cowie & mckee 1977 , mckee & cowie 1977 , balbus & mckee 1982 , mckee & begelman 1990 , bandiera & chen 1994 among others ) .",
    "this problem is relevant for the survival of cold clouds in multi - phase cluster cooling flows ( e.g. , bhringer & fabian 1989 , fabian , canizares , & bhringer 1994 ) .",
    "the general consensus emerging from these studies , as summarized by fabian ( 1994 ) , is that heat conduction must be suppressed by one to two orders of magnitude below the spitzer value , otherwise the radiative cooling of the gas will be overcome by heat conduction .",
    "however , the direct evidence for suppression of heat conductivity in the intracluster medium ( icm ) is scarce ( one of a few examples can be found in bechtold et al .  1983 ) .",
    "the _ chandra",
    "_ observations of the interstellar medium in the coma galaxies presented here allow a direct study of cold clouds embedded in a hot intracluster medium .",
    "we use @xmath2  km  s@xmath3  kpc@xmath3 , which implies a linear scale of 0.68  kpc per arcsec at the coma distance ( @xmath4mpc ) .",
    "the coma cluster was observed with acis in the fall of 1999 in a series of 6 pointings with individual exposures of @xmath5  ksec .",
    "the pointing position was kept the same during these observations , with ngc4874 and ngc4874 located at off - axis distances of 2.8  and 4.0 , respectively .",
    "the detector was moved in the focal plane between the pointings , so that the galaxies were observed by both acis - i ( 4 times ) and acis - s ( 2 times ) .",
    "there were no background flares in the coma observations .",
    "in one pointing , ngc4874 was located in the gap between the acis - i chips .",
    "the total exposure was 48  ksec for ngc4874 and 56  ksec for ngc4889 .",
    "the central part of the composite acis - i image is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : big ] .",
    "notice the faint arcmin - scale x - ray enhancements around ngc4874 and 4889 , previously detected by _",
    "rosat_. at the center of these extended structures there are bright ( 500 counts ) compact sources coincident with the optical positions of the galaxies .",
    "the observed 0.52  kev flux is @xmath6  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath7 for ngc4874  and @xmath8  erg  s@xmath3  @xmath7 for ngc4889 , corresponding to luminosities in the same band of @xmath9 and @xmath10  erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "the enlarged x - ray and optical images of ngc4874 and 4889 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : panels ] .",
    "the x - ray sources associated with the galaxies are extended , but unlike most ellipticals , the x - ray emission is much more compact than the distribution of optical light .",
    "below we discuss these interesting objects in detail .",
    "the spectra of the ngc4874 and 4889 sources were extracted within a radius of 7@xmath11  ( which encompasses most of the observed x - ray flux ) .",
    "since we are interested in the intrinsic properties of the galaxies , we collected the background spectra in the 15@xmath1130@xmath11  annuli around them , so it includes the true background as well as the emission of the coma cluster .",
    "the source , background spectra , and the response files were generated individually for each pointing .",
    "we then co - added the observed spectra and averaged the response files for each source .    in the spectra for both galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : panels ] ) , one immediately notices strong emission lines near 1  kev  a key signature of a 1  kev - temperature plasma .",
    "indeed , the spectra are well fit by the mewe - kaastra - liedahl model in xspec with the absorption fixed at the galactic value @xmath12  @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the observed x - ray emission is most likely produced by warm interstellar gas",
    ". the x - ray emission can not be due to the integrated emission of stars because its spatial distribution does not follow the optical light ( fig .",
    "[ fig : panels ] and [ fig : profile:4874 ] ) .",
    "any significant contribution by low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) can be ruled out because it also should follow the starlight and have a very different ( hard ) spectrum ( sarazin , irwin , & bregman 2001 ) .",
    "the best - fit temperatures and metal abundances of these sources are listed in table  [ tab : spectra ] ( the uncertainties hereafter are at the 68% confidence level for one interesting parameter ) .",
    "the average temperature is 1.0  kev for ngc4874 and 1.8  kev for ngc4889 .",
    "the average abundance of heavy elements is close to the solar value in both galaxies .",
    "this is significantly higher than the metal abundance in the surrounding coma gas ( @xmath13 , arnaud et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "_ chandra _ s angular resolution permits spectral fitting in several concentric annuli in ngc4874 .",
    "this analysis reveals a marginally significant ( at the 99% confidence level ) decrease of the gas temperature towards the center of the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tprofile:4874 ] and table  [ tab : spectra ] ) .",
    "ngc4889 does not show any non - isothermality , but the statistical errors are much larger .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath14  fixed .",
    "the results of the surface brightness profile modeling are summarized in table  [ tab : profiles ] .",
    "we were unable to obtain meaningful constraints on @xmath15 because of the parameter correlation and finite psf .",
    "generally , all @xmath16 are allowed .",
    "the cutoff and core - radii are well - constrained for @xmath17 . for larger @xmath15 ,",
    "the cutoff radius becomes much larger than the core - radius and hence has almost no effect on the observed profile .",
    "for a pure @xmath15-model without a cutoff , @xmath15 must be in excess of @xmath18 , mimicking the cutoff at @xmath19 , which is consistent with the best - fit @xmath20 .",
    "of course , different models correspond to very similar absolute gas density distributions in the radial range of interest .",
    "it is interesting to compare the pressure of the ism at the best - fit cutoff radius with the external pressure of the cluster gas .",
    "even though the three - dimensional location of the galaxies within the cluster is uncertain , the icm density in their vicinity can be determined rather accurately because each galaxy has an associated arcmin - scale x - ray enhancement ( vikhlinin et al .",
    "1994 ) : @xmath21  @xmath22 around ngc4874 and @xmath23  @xmath22 around ngc4889 .",
    "the temperature of the cluster gas around both galaxies is @xmath24  kev ( see above ) .",
    "remarkably , we find that for the observed ism parameters , the pressure ratio at @xmath25 is @xmath26 for ngc4874 and @xmath27 for ngc4889 .",
    "therefore , the pressure of the ism in both galaxies equals the external pressure at a radius where the _ chandra _ image independently indicates an ism density cutoff .",
    "this is a clear indication that the distribution of the ism is affected by the external pressure .",
    "the derived central ism densities are higher by a factor of 210 than those normally found in isolated elliptical galaxies ( @xmath28  @xmath22 ; forman , jones & tucker 1985 ) , which also suggests compression by an external pressure .",
    "stellar ejecta is the most likely source of interstellar gas since the metal abundance in the ism of both galaxies is significantly higher than that in the coma icm .",
    "the observed gas mass ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 in ngc4874 and ngc4889 , respectively ) would be ejected by stars over the time @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the stellar mass loss rate per unit optical luminosity . using the generally adapted value @xmath33  yr@xmath3",
    "@xmath34 ( faber & gallagher 1976 ) and the optical luminosity within @xmath20 ( faber et al .",
    "1997 ) , we find @xmath35  yr in both galaxies .",
    "therefore , stellar ejecta easily produce the observed ism over the galaxy lifetime .",
    "the ism is subject to radiative cooling , thermal evaporation due to the surrounding hot gas , heating by stellar winds and supernovae , and possibly to ram pressure stripping .",
    "_ ram pressure stripping_. the observed x - ray centroids are within 0.5  kpc of the optical centers ( limited by the _",
    "chandra _ aspect accuracy ) .",
    "this and the azimuthally symmetric x - ray morphology probably exclude any significant ongoing stripping .",
    "stripping will be unimportant if the galaxies move together with their surrounding 100  kpc scale gas density enhancements .",
    "_ radiative cooling_. the average cooling time of the ism is @xmath36 . for the observed ism parameters , we find @xmath37  yr for ngc4874 and @xmath38  yr for ngc4889 , with a @xmath39 uncertainty .",
    "_ stellar winds and supernovae_. after @xmath40  years past the burst of star formation , the average temperature of ejecta from normal stars and supernovae is @xmath41  kev ( david , forman , & jones 1990 ) .",
    "therefore , stellar mass loss can not be a source of heating for the ism with @xmath42  kev .",
    "_ thermal evaporation_. following cowie & mckee ( 1977 ) , one can show that classical heat conduction through the ism - icm boundaries of our galaxies should be saturated . from their equation",
    "( 64 ) , we find the saturated evaporation timescales @xmath43  yr for ngc4874 and @xmath44 for ngc4889 , with a 20% formal statistical uncertainty .",
    "the timescales for radiative cooling and classical evaporation are both very short and the ism would be destroyed quickly by either mechanism , unless the radiative cooling and the heat influx that drives evaporation balance each other .",
    "this would be achieved if the conductivity through the icm - ism interface is a factor of @xmath45 below the classical value .",
    "a plausible reason for such a suppression is a disjoint magnetic structure of the ism and icm .",
    "if heat influx from the icm does balance radiative cooling of the ism , one expects that at each radius , the x - ray volume emissivity of the ism equals the divergence of the heat flux ( i.e. , the local heating rate ) .",
    "interestingly , this can be verified for ngc4874 , where we observe a temperature gradient and therefore can estimate the heat flux .",
    "assuming that conductivity in the ism is classical , the heat flux is @xmath46  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath3 where @xmath47 is the plasma temperature in degrees ( mckee & cowie 1977 ) .",
    "for the observed radial dependence of temperature in ngc4874 which can be modeled as @xmath48 $ ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tprofile:4874 ] ) , the divergence of @xmath49 is indeed within a factor of 1.5 of the observed x - ray volume emissivity .    for ngc4889 ,",
    "the uncertainty in the temperature profile is too large to compute the heat flux .",
    "however , we can say that its ism temperature is too high to be plausibly maintained by internal heat sources such as stellar mass loss and supernovae , so there should be external heating , most likely due to conduction through the ism boundary .",
    "_ chandra _ observations show that the dominant coma galaxies retain a fraction of their x - ray coronae in the form of compact ( @xmath50  kpc in size ) clouds with temperatures of @xmath51 and @xmath52  kev which are in the pressure equilibrium with the hot intracluster gas .",
    "time scales for radiative cooling and classical evaporation are very short but the ism observed in two galaxies is unlikely to be a transient phenomenon .",
    "we propose that cooling in the ism is balanced by heat influx through the cluster / ism interface .",
    "for this , thermal conductivity through the interface should be 30100 times below the classical value , perhaps because of the disjoint magnetic field structure .",
    "furthermore , in ngc4874 , the observed radial temperature gradient implies that if the conductivity _ inside _ the ism cloud is classical , then heat from outside the cloud is distributed through the cloud volume in such a way that it precisely balances radiative cooling at each radius .",
    "this leaves little or no energy for the ism evaporation , preserving the ism clouds for a sufficiently long time ."
