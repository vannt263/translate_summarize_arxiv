    "the anti  de sitter spacetime is one of the simplest and most symmetric solutions of einstein s field equations including the cosmological constant .",
    "for this reason it is important for general relativity and it has its own mathematical relevance .",
    "after 1998 this spacetime has drawn attention of high energy physicists due to the conjectured anti ",
    "de sitter space / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence suggesting that fundamental particle interactions may be described in geometrical terms with the aid of this spacetime @xcite .",
    "this idea has given rise to a great number of works on this spacetime which take into account only those geometrical features of it that are relevant in this quantum field theory aspect and seem to disregard all its other properties .",
    "we shall not discuss the correspondence , we wish only to emphasize that this spacetime , which has become one of the most fundamental spacetimes in physics , has rather bizarre geometrical properties and is weird also from the physical viewpoint . by the latter",
    "we mean motions of material ( classical ) bodies and propagation of light signals in this background .",
    "+ in this spacetime almost everything is bizarre including its name . in the older literature ,",
    "particularly mathematical , it was termed _",
    "de sitter spacetime of the second kind _ and the current name has been given to it to stress that its geometrical properties are opposite to those of de sitter spacetime ( which was studied earlier and more frequently as it better fits our intuition ) though at first sight the two spaces should be similar .",
    "( to the best of our knowledge the term appeared for the first time in ref .",
    "these bizarre properties were discovered by mathematicians rather long ago and exist in the literature which is now not easy to find .",
    "this is why this paper is written : its purpose is to collect and present in a possibly systematic way those features of the spacetime which are geometrically and physically important and can be expounded in almost elementary terms without resorting to sophisticated mathematics . in consequence",
    "its contents are hardly new , nonetheless we give rather few references .",
    "we find it easier to explicitly derive _ ab initio _ each result than to seek it in the dispersed literature ; thus in most cases we can not pretend to originality .",
    "some very recently published and unpublished results are presented in sections 7 , 8 , 9 and in appendix .",
    "+ we first give the geometrical construction of the spacetime and show some of its global features .",
    "then we focus our interest on motions : what an observer would see if he occurred to be there .",
    "we present all these effects in analytic form and our figures are simple diagrams illustrating these expressions . the reader interested in various images of the spacetime is referred to ref .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with fundamentals of general relativity and tensor calculus .",
    "the name of the spacetime will be abbreviated to _ ads space _ and the term _ space _ will mean _ spacetime",
    "_ whenever there will be no risk of confusing it with the _ physical space _ of the spacetime .",
    "ads space may be defined in any number of spacetime dimensions equal to or larger than 2 . here",
    "we will be dealing only with the physical case of 4 dimensions .",
    "first one introduces an auxiliary unphysical 5dimensional flat space @xmath0 with cartesian coordinates @xmath1 having two timelike dimensions @xmath2 and @xmath3 and three spatial ones @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 . accordingly , the line element ( the square of the spacetime interval ) or the metric is @xmath7 ads is defined as a 4dimensional hypersurface in @xmath0 given by the equation @xmath8 the constant @xmath9 has dimension of length and determines , as we shall see , the curvature scale of ads . the hypersurface is the locus of points equidistant ( in this metric ) to the origin of the cartesian coordinate system and is legitimately termed _",

    "one can parametrize points of the pseudosphere by means of four parameters which are so chosen that eq .",
    "( 2 ) holds identically .",
    "different parameterizations correspond to distinct coordinate systems on ads . here",
    "we present 5 different systems and each of them is most suitable for displaying a distinct geometrical feature .",
    "+ before doing it a comment on a distinction between reference frames and coordinate systems is in order .",
    "a reference frame is an ordered structure of material bodies , either point particles or extended bodies ( rigid or not ) , covering the entire space of the spacetime , together with an infinite set of clocks densely located in the space and remaining at rest with respect to nearby bodies of the frame ( in general the clocks and the bodies to which they are attached may move with respect to distant bodies of the frame in the sense that the distance between them may vary in time ) .",
    "the reference frame is a physical system which , at least in principle , can be built out of massive particles and which is the essential structure to make any physical measurements and to label spacetime points ( events ) .",
    "the fundamental example is any inertial frame of reference in special relativity , being a dense infinite grid of rigid rods , equipped with clocks located at the intersection points of the grid ; the whole system is free of accelerations and nonrotating . in a curved spacetime",
    "the collection of reference frames must be much wider and clearly there are no inertial frames . yet",
    "a coordinate system is a purely mathematical way of labelling points in the spacetime ( in the mathematical language it is a coordinate chart on a differential manifold , with all the charts forming the atlas ) .",
    "each physical reference frame allows to introduce infinite number of coordinate systems .",
    "for instance , in an inertial frame , the standard cartesian coordinates @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the physical ( i.  e.  proper ) time measured by clocks in this frame , one can introduce coordinates @xmath14 , where @xmath15 are curvilinear spatial coordinates defined as given functions of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , e.  g.  the spherical ones and @xmath19 with monotonously growing function @xmath20 .",
    "we emphasize that to assign coordinates to points in a physical spacetime one must apply a material reference frame and in this sense most of coordinate systems that are used are connected to some frame . however the freedom to mathematically construct coordinate systems is larger than it is allowed by reference frames .",
    "this means that there are coordinate systems which are not generated by a reference frame , e.  g.  null coordinates defined in terms of a , , null frame  ; these coordinates are useful in some calculations , but they are not measurable",
    ". parameters @xmath21 .",
    "points of ads in @xmath0 are represented by @xmath22 here @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are ordinary angular coordinates on the 2sphere @xmath27 . inserting eq .",
    "( 3 ) into eq . ( 2 )",
    "one finds that it holds identically . yet inserting eq . ( 3 ) into the line element ( 1 ) one finds that the square of the interval between two close points , @xmath28 and @xmath29 on the pseudosphere is @xmath30 by comparison with the line element in minkowski space in spherical coordinates @xmath31 one identifies @xmath13 as a time coordinate and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 as spatial coordinates and the angles @xmath33 and @xmath34 determine the metric on the unit sphere @xmath27 as @xmath35 .",
    "then @xmath32 is interpreted as a _ radial coordinate _ , but this term does not determine the coordinate uniquely .",
    "the radial coordinate in the euclidean 3space @xmath36 has two features : if points of a sphere have the radial coordinate @xmath37 , then i ) the length of the equator is @xmath38 ( and the area of the sphere is @xmath39 ) and ii ) the radius of the sphere , i.  e.  the distance of each of its points to the centre is @xmath40 .",
    "these two features can not hold together in a curved space and one must choose between them .",
    "a space is spherically symmetric ( only then the notion of the radial coordinate makes sense ) if there exist coordinates , frequently denoted @xmath21 , such that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the angular coordinates on the sphere and the full metric depends on the angles via only one term @xmath41 ( actually the correct mathematical definition is more sophisticated and we omit it ) ; then @xmath32 deserves the name , , radial  .",

    "+ the three coordinate systems represent the same physical reference frame and have common important features . in the defining equation ( 2 )",
    "all the five coordinates range from @xmath61 to @xmath62 and the transformation ( 3 ) preserves this range .",
    "this implies that the charts ( coordinate systems ) ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) cover the entire manifold ( spacetime ) besides the coordinate singularities such as @xmath63 .",
    "the hypersurfaces of simultaneity @xmath64const form the physical 3spaces with the metric defined as @xmath65 for @xmath66 . from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , @xmath67 this is lobatchevsky ( hyperbolic ) space @xmath68 with coordinates @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "the curvature tensor of @xmath68 is ( greek indices are spacetime ones , @xmath69 and latin lower case indices are spatial , @xmath70 ) @xmath71 the curvature scalar @xmath72 for eq .",
    "( 8) is equal to @xmath73 and this property together with eq .",
    "( 9 ) is expressed by saying that the hyperbolic space @xmath68 is a _ space of constant negative curvature_. the space ads has an analogous property : its four  dimensional riemann tensor is given by a similar expression , @xmath74 where its metric @xmath75 is taken either from eq .",
    "( 4 ) , ( 5 ) or ( 7 ) ( or any other coordinate system ) and the 4dimensional curvature scalar @xmath76 .",
    "notice that the metric signature is chosen here as @xmath77 since it is more suitable for dealing with timelike worldlines of massive particles , whereas in classical field theory the opposite signature is commonly used .",
    "altering the signature results in the change of sign of the scalar @xmath78 and this is why ads space is frequently characterized as a _ spacetime of constant negative curvature_. + the metric of eqs .",

    "stationary_. furthermore , this spacetime is _ static _ , i.  e.  the time inversion @xmath79 does not change the form of the metric .",
    "the gravitational field of a motionless star is static ( for instance schwarzschild field ) , yet a uniformly rotating star generates a stationary field : it is time independent , but the time inversion makes the star rotate in the opposite direction and its gravitational field is changed ( e.  g.  kerr spacetime ) .",
    "+ now we introduce two further coordinate systems describing two different reference frames .",
    "the poincar coordinates @xmath80 . instead of eq .",
    "( 3 ) one applies @xmath81 then the metric is @xmath82 here @xmath83 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are real and @xmath84 . from eq . ( 11 ) one gets @xmath85 , what implies that these coordinates cover only one half of ads manifold .",
    "the other half needs a similar chart with @xmath86 .",
    "the reference system given in eq .",
    "( 12 ) is moving with respect to that given in eq .",
    "( 4 ) and their coordinate times , @xmath13 and @xmath83 are distinct . the expression in the round brackets in eq .",
    "( 12 ) represents the metric of flat minkowski space expressed in cartesian coordinates of an inertial reference frame .",
    "( at this moment we disregard the derivation of eq .",
    "( 12 ) and discuss only its final form . ) thus the metric of ads is proportional to the metric of the flat spacetime , the proportionality factor is a scalar function of the coordinates .",
    "this is a geometrical property of ads space , valid in all coordinate systems .",
    "the poincar coordinates are distinguished by making this property explicit ; it is rather hard to recognize it in other coordinates . by , , hard  we mean that if one uses only the three above mentioned coordinate systems ( or any other ones ) and is unaware that the spacetime is the pseudosphere in @xmath0 and that it may be parametrized by the poincar coordinates , then finding out the transformation to the metric ( 12 ) is really difficult .",
    "yet showing this property is actually quite easy if one uses the weyl tensor : this tensor is related to the riemann curvature one and if the proportionality property holds for a spacetime , then this tensor ( computed in any coordinate system ) vanishes . in short ,",
    "if the weyl tensor is zero , then the metric is proportional to the flat one . in this article",
    "we shall not apply this tensor .",
    "if two spacetimes , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , have their metric tensors ( expressed in the same coordinates ) proportional , @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a scalar function , then the two spacetimes are _ conformally related_. let two conformally related metric tensors be introduced on the same spacetime ( considered as a , , bare ",
    "manifold of points ) , then distances between any pair of points expressed in terms of these metrics will be different , yet the angles between any two curves are the same in both the metrics and this explains why the property is called _",
    "conformality_. ads is _ conformally flat_. + the space @xmath91 in poincar coordinates is conformal to a half of euclidean space @xmath36 .",
    "finally one takes the following parametrization : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and the radial coordinate @xmath94 is dimensionless .",
    "the metric is now time dependent , @xmath95 the coordinates cover only a part of the spacetime since @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the static nature of ads becomes now invisible and at first sight these coordinates seem to be a mere complication .",
    "we shall see below , however , that @xmath98 are _ comoving coordinates _ and reveal an important property of motion of free particles . by comparing eqs .",
    "( 4 ) , ( 8) and ( 14 ) one sees that the space @xmath99 is the lobatchevsky space @xmath68 .",
    "+ one may introduce a number of other coordinates , but the spherical angles @xmath33 and @xmath34 are never altered .",
    "ads space as the pseudosphere in the ambient @xmath0 is unbounded in each direction . yet from eq .",
    "( 3 ) one sees that the times @xmath2 and @xmath3 are parametrized by a _ periodic _",
    "time @xmath13 on the pseudosphere : the two quadruples , @xmath100 and @xmath101 represent the same point of it .",
    "this means that in ads space , defined as a manifold of points @xmath21 , one must identify @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "more precisely , the range of time is @xmath104 and points @xmath105 and @xmath106 are identified .",
    "in other terms , the coordinate lines of time @xmath13 , where @xmath107 , are closed they form circles @xmath108 . on the other hand the hyperbolic space @xmath68 has topology ( in the sense of geometrical topology ) of euclidean @xmath109 , then the entire ads has the product topology @xmath110 .",
    "closed timelike curves are very unpleasant from the physical viewpoint . though it may be argued that they do not break the causality and need not to give rise to various paradoxes ( , , to kill one s own grandfather  ) , it is desired to remove them if possible .",
    "this may be achieved due to the fact that the metric ( 4 ) ( as well as eq .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 7 ) ) is time independent and the periodicity in time is invisible .",
    "one simply unwraps all time circles @xmath108 and extends them in the line of real numbers , now @xmath111 .",
    "geometrically this means making infinite number of turns around the pseudosphere in its time direction . to avoid the periodic identification of points in this direction one discards the pseudosphere model and introduces a new spacetime : one discards the whole derivation of eq .",
    "( 4 ) based on employing the ambient space @xmath0 and constructing the pseudosphere in it .",
    "instead one defines the manifold as a set of points @xmath21 with @xmath112 equipped with the metric in eq .",

    "we shall be mainly dealing with cads space ( unless otherwise is stated )",
    ". it will be quite surprising to see that replacing ads by cads space is a merely verbal operation and the latter inherits most of the features of the former . + in the search for symmetries of cads space one may resort to the pseudosphere since symmetries are local isometric mappings of the space onto itself preserving the form of the metric and do not depend on the topology . like the ordinary sphere in euclidean space",
    ", the pseudosphere has as its symmetries the rotational symmetry of the ambient space , in this case this is @xmath115 group , which is analogous to @xmath116 lorentz group of minkowski space .",

    "cads is _ maximally symmetric_. + an important global property of a spacetime is its structure at infinity .",

    "clearly , the proper time interval between the highest points , @xmath383 and @xmath384 is @xmath385 and the same interval is between the initial point @xmath386 and its antipodal one @xmath387 , independently of the energy @xmath388 @xcite . notice that the special solution @xmath389 and @xmath390 actually represents the , , canonical  description of any timelike geodesic given in eq .",
    "this shows that the detailed behavior of any geodesic revealed by the general solution in eq .",

    "( 42 ) but then one gets a generic formula for @xmath391 being a complicated expression involving functions arc tan , which is of little use .",
    "instead one considers a special case of @xmath392 , then eq .",
    "( 42 ) is reduced to @xmath393 and if the length of this geodesic is divided into intervals according to @xmath394 , where @xmath395 and @xmath396 , the time coordinate is @xmath397 the coordinate time interval between the highest point , @xmath398 , and its antipodal one ( always in the 3space ) , is @xmath399 , and clearly the same holds for the generic geodesic c. this means that the geodesics b and c will intersect first at @xmath400 and then at @xmath401 and later infinite many times . whereas the twins b and c meet each other after the constant intervals @xmath402 , which are independent of c s initial velocity , twin c meets a after the time interval @xcite @xmath403 and the corresponding length of the geodesic c is @xmath404 these two expressions are so complicated that it is not easy to analytically compare the lengths of a and c for the interval @xmath405 ( being the time of c s flight on the route @xmath406 ) .",
    "it has been numerically shown that always @xmath407 , as it should be , since on this segment of the geodesic c there are no points conjugate to @xmath197 . in fig .",
    "3 we depict two radial geodesics emanating from a common point .     and @xmath408 , emanating from a common point , chosen for simplicity as @xmath409 .",
    "the length scale is @xmath410 .",
    "the geodesics must return to @xmath359 and intersect at @xmath411 , then they go to @xmath412 corresponding to the direction @xmath142 and again intersect at @xmath413 , @xmath359 .",
    "this evolution repeats infinite many times .",
    "all points @xmath414 and @xmath415 are inaccessible from the initial point along a timelike geodesic . ]",
    "finally we illustrate the results of the paper with a numerical example .",
    "let the curvature scale of cads space be @xmath416 light year , then the cosmological constant is @xmath417 .",
    "let from the coordinate origin @xmath392 be emitted simultaneously a photon and a particle of mass @xmath266 , both radially and in the same direction , they move along a null and a timelike geodesic , respectively . at a spatial point p at @xmath418",
    "they are reflected backwards by a mirror and return to @xmath392 . employing formulae given above",
    "one finds that along the photon path there is @xmath419 and the value @xmath379 at the highest point shows that @xmath420 , then the distance between the origin and p ( measured along the radial spacelike geodesic at @xmath117 ) is @xmath421 l.y .",
    "the coordinate time of the photon flight to p and back is equal to the proper time measured by a clock staying at rest at @xmath392 and is @xmath422 and is very slightly below @xmath248 or slightly below @xmath423 years .",
    "the massive particle is ultrarelativistic and closely follows the photon ; from @xmath424 one gets that its energy is @xmath425 and its proper time interval when reaching @xmath379 is exactly @xmath426 , then its total travel lasts @xmath427 years . both the photon and the particle travel the distance @xmath428 l.y . and to go it they need a period of time not exceeding @xmath423 years .",
    "this outcome deceptively suggests that the photon and the particle move at superluminal velocities since their average velocity is @xmath429 .",
    "clearly the local velocity of light is always @xmath45 and this superluminal one is merely a result of the weird geometry of cads space .",
    "anti  de sitter space is one of the three simplest , maximally symmetric solutions to vacuum einstein field equations .",
    "its metric is static with the time coordinate extending from @xmath61 to @xmath62 , nonetheless most of its geometric properties are periodic in the time , something which is incomprehensible from the intrinsic four  dimensional viewpoint .",
    "the light seems to move at superluminal velocities since the photon may travel over arbitrarily large distances ( to spatial infinity and back ) in a finite time interval . in static coordinates covering the whole spacetime one can single out in the set of all timelike geodesics the radial and circular curves , yet",
    "it turns out that this distinction is geometrically irrelevant and is merely coordinate dependent .",
    "no timelike geodesic can escape to the spatial infinity unless it has infinite energy .",
    "also a timelike geodesic may travel large distances at a superluminal average velocity .",
    "all timelike geodesics emanating from a common initial event @xmath430 return to the same point @xmath431 in the space after the time interval @xmath432 ; this means that all simultaneous events ( @xmath433 ) , though belonging to the chronological future of the initial event , are inaccessible from the latter by a timelike geodesic . in other words ,",
    "any point @xmath434 can not be reached from @xmath430 by a free fall in any direction and with any initial velocity , if the points @xmath431 and @xmath435 are different .",
    "these bizarre features become understandable only if one divides the whole spacetime into an infinite chain of segments and each of them is identified with the anti  de sitter space proper and the latter is modelled as a pseudosphere in an unphysical five  dimensional space . in this space each timelike geodesic od ads space forms a circle of the same radius , which accounts for their weird properties .",
    "this necessity is in conflict with general relativity stating that a physical spacetime is four  dimensional and all its properties are intrinsically grounded , without resorting to a fictitious higher dimensional embedding space .",
    "finally , if the boundary conditions are suitably chosen , ads space is unstable and can not be a ground state for spacetimes with @xmath436 .",
    "the conclusion , therefore , is unambiguous : this spacetime is unphysical and can not describe a physical world .",
    "it may only serve as a mathematical tool in field theory , e.  g.  in the recent ads / cft correspondence . + * acknowledgments*. we gratefully acknowledge useful critical comments by andrzej staruszkiewicz and we are grateful to szymon sikora for help in preparing the figures .",
    "here we derive an explicit transformation recasting a circular timelike geodesic on ads space into a radial one . to this end",
    "one uses the static coordinates @xmath340 of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , then points @xmath286 of the pseudosphere in the ambient space are parametrized by these variables according to eq .",
    "( 3 ) with @xmath373 . for any timelike geodesic the angles @xmath33 and @xmath34 may be so chosen that the curve lies in the two - surface @xmath148 , then its points are @xmath437 as in sect .",
    "9 a circular geodesic @xmath438 has @xmath341 , @xmath346 , @xmath347 , its radius is determined by the energy , @xmath439 and its coordinates @xmath440 are @xmath441 to determine the directional five  vectors one compares eq .",
    "( 47 ) for @xmath51 , @xmath346 and @xmath442 with eq .",
    "( 48 ) and gets @xmath443 and @xmath444 . +",
    "now assume that in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath445 ( different from @xmath286 one ) a radial geodesic @xmath446 is described by @xmath447 and @xmath448 are parametrized by @xmath449 as in eq .",
    "one sets @xmath450 at points of @xmath446 and assuming that it emanates from @xmath451 with @xmath452 its coordinates @xmath453 and @xmath454 are given by the right  hand sides of eqs .",
    "( 43 ) and ( 44 ) , the latter holds for @xmath455 . to determine the directional vectors in this case it is sufficient to take @xmath456 in eq .",
    "( 44 ) and apply the identity @xmath457 $ ] , then @xmath458 next one inserts the relationships ( 47 ) into eq .",
    "( 49 ) with due replacements of @xmath286 by @xmath445 , @xmath459 by @xmath460 and with @xmath461 and employs there eq . ( 43 ) for @xmath462 and eq .",
    "finally the normalizations of eq .",
    "( 33 ) provide @xmath463 and @xmath464 .",
    "if @xmath446 and @xmath438 are two different ( coordinate dependent ) descriptions of the same curve in @xmath0 , there exists a linear transformation of the pair @xmath465 into @xmath466 .",
    "one then seeks for a transformation @xmath467 , @xmath468 such that @xmath469 and @xmath470 . according to the fundamental theorem both the geodesics",
    "are geometrically represented by circles with the same radius , hence all other their characteristics , such as the conserved energy , are coordinate dependent and irrelevant .",
    "one can therefore put @xmath471 . a simple and long computation results in @xmath264 depending on one arbitrary parameter and setting it equal zero",
    "one gets the simplest form of the matrix , @xmath472 @xmath473 .",
    "it is clear that both @xmath438 and @xmath446 emanate from the same point for @xmath292 .",
    "in fact , the initial point @xmath197 of @xmath438 has coordinates @xmath474 and after the transformation its coordinates are @xmath475 and these are the coordinates of the initial point of @xmath446 , @xmath476 .",
    "we notice that the transformation in ads space from @xmath477 to @xmath478 ( for @xmath479 ) is very intricate and hence useless .",
