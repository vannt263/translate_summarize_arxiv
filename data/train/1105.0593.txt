    "the discovery of neutrino mass has provided a wealth of information regarding the flavour structure of nature ( for reviews see  @xcite ; for the latest global fit see  @xcite )",
    ". however , key questions regarding the neutrino sector remain unanswered and , in particular , the underlying mechanism responsible for neutrino mass remains elusive .",
    "the seesaw mechanism provides a simple explanation for the lightness of the known neutrinos  @xcite . in its standard implementation",
    "one assumes @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the neutrino dirac mass , @xmath9 is the singlet majorana mass and @xmath10 is the @xmath11 boson mass . the result is a light standard model ( sm ) neutrino with mass @xmath12 and a heavy sterile neutrino with mass @xmath13 . despite the simplicity of this approach , it offers little hope of being experimentally verified due to the invocation of the typically ( very ) large scale @xmath9 .",
    "a number of alternative mechanisms invoke new physics to explain neutrino masses without relying on a large uv scale .",
    "these offer the advantage of being experimentally verifiable and one may hope that the requisite new physics appears at the tev scale .",
    "this can happen in models with radiatively - generated neutrino mass  @xcite , and the mechanism of mass generation can even be connected to the weak scale in models with coleman - weinberg symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "of course , nature is likely not concerned with our ability to experimentally ascertain its inner workings .",
    "nonetheless it is interesting to explore alternative approaches to neutrino mass that may lie within experimental reach ; particularly if they enable a natural realization and/or provide insight into the observed flavour structures .    beyond being sm singlets",
    ", right - handed neutrinos can form part of a more complicated hidden sector , and may provide a link to the dark / hidden sector of the universe .",
    "this feature is used to advantage in models that invoke non - standard properties of the gauge - singlet neutrinos in an effort to understand the origin of neutrino mass .",
    "for example , interesting exceptions to the standard seesaw picture arise if the right - handed neutrinos are bulk fields in an extra dimension  @xcite or if they are composite objects within a strongly coupled hidden sector  @xcite .",
    "a recent work has proposed a `` mini - seesaw mechanism '' in which naturally suppressed dirac and ( sterile ) majorana masses are combined to achieve light sm neutrinos via a low - scale seesaw  @xcite .",
    "this approach borrows elements from both the extra - dimensional scenario and the composite right - handed neutrino approach : the sterile neutrinos are bulk fields in a truncated slice of @xmath14 but , via the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , the model has a dual 4d description in which the right - handed neutrinos are the lightest composites of a strongly coupled hidden sector .",
    "a key feature of this approach is the presence of a tower of light ( order gev ) sterile neutrinos that can be thought of as either kaluza - klein modes or higher fermionic resonances of the cft ( with mass gap ) . in this work",
    "we consider the detailed bounds on these light sterile - neutrinos .",
    "we show that viable parameter space exists in which sm neutrino masses can be successfully generated without recourse to large ( supra - tev ) scales .",
    "furthermore , we show that it may be possible to observe the effects of the sterile neutrinos in forthcoming experiments : the most stringent constraints come from the fcnc process @xmath0 and , as we will show , the interesting region of parameter space corresponds to @xmath15 .",
    "this is right below the current experimental bound and within the region to be probed by the meg experiment  @xcite .",
    "the meg collaboration recently reported that the best value for the number of signal events in their maximal likelihood fit is three  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this corresponds to @xmath16 which , as we show , is obtained via the mini - seesaw with neutrino yukawa couplings approaching the @xmath17 level .    before proceeding we note that bulk gauge - singlet neutrinos in randall - sundrum ( rs ) models  @xcite were considered in  @xcite and bulk sm fermions in  @xcite .",

    "we will focus on values of $ r^{-1}\\sim$~gev and investigate whether the bounds allow $ \\mathcal{o}(1)$ values for the yukawa coupling $ \\lambda$. before turning to these matters , we note that , via the application of the ads / cft correspondence to rs models~\\cite{arkanihamed:2000ds } , the present model is considered dual to a 4d theory in which the uv localized sm fields are treated as fundamental objects external to a hidden strongly - coupled sector .",
    "the composite objects correspond to ir localized fields in the 5d picture ( roughly ; see e.g.~\\cite{batell:2007jv } ) and the lightest fermionic composite is the right - handed neutrino ( or neutrinos in a three generation model ) .",

    "are expected to have sizeable mass splittings and thus contribute significantly to @xmath99-decay .",

    "let us emphasize , however , that the sm contribution will typically dominate the kk contribution in the region of parameter space where the largest kk contribution comes from the zero - mode .",
    "it has been argued that , generically , in seesaw models the contribution from the sm neutrinos is larger than the sterile neutrino contribution  @xcite .",

    "we only plot the kk contribution in figure  [ fig : nubb_vs_c ] to emphasize the behaviour of this new contribution .",
    "mixing between the sm neutrinos and sterile neutrinos induces an effective coupling between the @xmath1 boson and the sterile neutrinos ; if the sterile neutrinos are light enough , additional invisible @xmath1-decay channels exist  @xcite . when a heavy sterile neutrino with mass @xmath123 mixes with the sm neutrinos , @xmath124 with @xmath125 , one has ( zn)=(z2 )  |_s|^2  ^2 .",

    "each member of the kk tower can decay to sm fields via off - shell gauge bosons can also decay directly to on - shell vectors . ] and it appears that the lep bounds should be applied to all of the kk neutrinos .",

    "<S> we study the bounds on these light sterile - neutrinos from processes like @xmath0 , invisible @xmath1-decays , and neutrinoless double beta - decay . </S>",
