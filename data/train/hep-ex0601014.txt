    "the miniboone experiment will confirm or refute the lsnd result @xcite with higher statistics and different sources of systematic error . while lsnd observed an excess of @xmath2 events in a @xmath3 beam ,",
    "the miniboone is a @xmath4 search .",
    "the miniboone detector is located 541 @xmath5 from a neutrino source on the booster neutrino beam line at fermi national accelerator laboratory .",
    "details of the beam line , the detector , major physics interactions and a blind - analysis strategy can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the interaction point , event time , energies , and the particle tracks are recorded from the times and charges of the pmt hits in the detector .",
    "the detector is calibrated over the full energy range from 50 to 1000 @xmath6 using all event types . stopping cosmic ray muons",
    "are used to calibrate the energy scale for muon - type events and measure the position and angle reconstruction resolution , when their path length can be identified .",
    "this is accomplished with a scintillator hodoscope on the top of the detector , combined with scintillation cubes at various positions within the detector volume .",
    "observed michel electrons from muon decay are used to calibrate the energy scale and reconstruction resolution of electron - type events at the 52.8 @xmath6 michel endpoint .",
    "reconstructed @xmath1 events provide another electron - like calibration source .",
    "the photons that are emitted in @xmath1 decays span a considerable range to over 1000 @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath1 mass derived from reconstructed energies and directions of two @xmath7-rays has a peak at 136.3@xmath80.8 @xmath6 .",
    "this is in an excellent agreement with 135.0 @xmath6 expectation , providing a check on the energy scale and the reconstruction over the full energy range of interest for @xmath0 appearance analysis .",
    "the events described in the calibration procedure are used as a basis for a particle identification ( pid ) .",
    "pid is performed by different algorithms that use the difference in characteristics of the cerenkov rings and scintillation light associated with electrons , muons , protons or @xmath1 s .",
    "these algorithms include a maximum likelihood method , neural net , and boosted decision trees @xcite .",
    "the left part of fig .  [ fig : fig2 ] shows an example of a boosted decision tree where the muon / electron separation was measured with cosmic ray muons and associated electrons .",
    "the overlap region in the electron distribution defines a fraction of muons mis - identified as electrons .",
    "similar pid separation is performed between electrons and other types of the detected events .",
    "the beam that arrives at the detector is almost pure @xmath9 with a small ( 0.6% ) contamination of @xmath0 coming from muon and kaon decays in the decay pipe .",
    "the @xmath0 from @xmath10-decay are directly tied to the observed @xmath9 interactions .",
    "taking into account a small solid angle subtended by the miniboone detector , the pion energy distribution can be determined from the energy of the observed @xmath9 events .",
    "the pion energy spectrum is then used to predict the @xmath0 from @xmath10-decay .",
    "a second source of @xmath0 originates from @xmath11-decay .",
    "this component will be constrained using data from two low energy production experiments : harp experiment at cern @xcite and e910 experiment at bnl @xcite .",
    "an additional check will be performed by a system called lmc ( little muon counters ) , measuring the muons from pion and kaon decays coming at wide angles from the decay pipe @xcite .",
    "an important background component comes from @xmath9 neutral production of @xmath1 .",
    "most @xmath1 are identified by the reconstruction of two cherenkov rings produced by two decay @xmath7-rays .",
    "however , the decay of @xmath1 can appear much like primary electron emerging from a @xmath0 charged current interaction if one of the gammas from the decay overlaps the other , or is too low in energy to be detected .",
    "over 99% of the nc @xmath1 are rejected in the appearance analysis .",
    "in addition to its primary decay @xmath12 , the @xmath13 resonance has a branching fraction of 0.56% to @xmath14 final state .",
    "the @xmath7-ray may mimic an electron from @xmath0 interaction .",
    "the rate of @xmath13 production in neutral current interactions can be estimated from the data , using the sample of reconstructed @xmath1 decays .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] illustrates the imitation of the signal by @xmath1 and @xmath13 events .",
    "most @xmath9 events can be easily identified by their penetration into the veto region when exiting muons fire the veto , or by muons stopping in the inner detector and producing a michel electron after a few microseconds .",
    "another handle on the background comes from the energy and/or pid output distributions of the signal and various background components .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig2 ] ( right ) shows the energy distribution of the background summed with an oscillation signal for @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a fit to the energy distribution results in an enhanced sensitivity as the intrinsic @xmath0 events show a high energy tail while mis - identified @xmath1 are much narrower",
    ".    an important cross - check of electron event reconstruction and particle identification comes from numi events observed in the miniboone detector @xcite .",
    "numi events consist of @xmath0 , @xmath9 , @xmath17 , @xmath1 and @xmath13 over the range of the energies relevant to the appearance analysis in miniboone .",
    "a complete list of cross - checks is given in table  [ tab : crosscheck ] ."
