    "packing problems address the various arrangements of a set ( finite or infinite ) of non - overlapping objects in a space of given dimension @xcite .",
    "often , one seeks to arrange the objects in such a way as to optimize a certain statistical or bulk property , e.g. the number density @xmath6 of objects ( or equivalently the packing fraction @xmath1 , the fraction of space covered by the objects interiors ) .",
    "this paper is concerned with optimizing the packing fraction @xmath1 and average number of contacts per sphere ( average kissing number ) @xmath2 for packings of congruent spheres in three - dimensional euclidean space while maintaining an assumed functional form for the pair correlation function ( defined below ) of a  random \" packing .",
    "random packings of three - dimensional hard spheres have been studied by scientists to better understand everything from heterogeneous materials to liquids to granular media ( like sand ) to living cells @xcite . in parallel to the concept of a maximum packing fraction for periodic ( crystalline ) packings , it had been assumed that a ( different ) maximum packing fraction could be defined for random packings , referred to as `` random close packing '' ( rcp ) @xcite .",
    "however , while there is a proved maximum packing fraction for hard - sphere periodic packings achieved via an fcc lattice or one of its stacking variants @xcite , the rcp state has been shown to be ill - defined @xcite .",
    "experimental packings of oiled steel ball bearings originally led to the idea that mechanically stable random packings of identical spheres could not exhibit packing fractions exceeding 0.64 or declining past 0.60 @xcite .",
    "mathematically constructed models @xcite and early computer simulations @xcite seemed to support these conclusions , though later work demonstrated that the limiting packing fractions obtained were highly dependent on the packing methods @xcite .",
    "these methods included , for example , lightly vibrating a container filled with spheres in either horizontal or vertical motions , rolling spheres one by one into a container @xcite , and simulating the compression of a hard - sphere gas @xcite .    changing the method of packing via molecular dynamics simulations showed that densities past 0.64 are realizable @xcite .",
    "however , it has yet to be demonstrated from a theoretical basis , i.e. , without resort to experiment or computer simulation , that indeed there is no maximum density limit for  random \" packings apart from the proved limit for periodic packings .",
    "this paper provides such a theoretical basis by extending previous optimization studies of @xmath0-invariant processes ( defined below ) @xcite to a broader class of disordered packings .    following previous work by two of us , a statistically homogeneous and isotropic packing",
    "is defined to be disordered if its pair correlation function @xmath7 in @xmath8-dimensional euclidean space @xmath9 decays to unity faster than @xmath10 for some @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "each packing corresponds to a unique @xmath7 , a function proportional to the probability density of finding a separation @xmath12 between any two sphere centers and normalized such that it takes the value of unity when no spatial correlations are present .",
    "the precise definition of  disordered \" via the pair correlation function takes the place of the imprecise term  random \" hereafter .",
    "the essential ideas behind our approach were actually laid out in our earlier work @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the main objective was to study disordered packings in which short - range order was controlled using so - called @xmath0-invariant processes .",
    "a _ @xmath0-invariant process _",
    "is one in which a given pair correlation function @xmath7 remains invariant for all @xmath12 as packing fraction varies over the range of densities @xmath13 the terminal packing fraction @xmath14 is the maximum achievable for the @xmath0-invariant process subject to satisfaction of the nonnegativity of @xmath7 and the structure factor @xmath15 , i.e. , @xmath16 @xmath17 for a statistically homogeneous and isotropic packing at number density @xmath6 , @xmath15 is related to the fourier transform of the _ total correlation function _",
    "@xmath18 , by @xmath19 where @xmath20 represents the fourier transform of @xmath21 . in three dimensions ,",
    "this can be written as @xmath22 the optimization procedure described above was formulated for a hard - sphere packing , which requires the additional condition on @xmath0 that respects the nonoverlap constraint , i.e. , @xmath23 when there exist sphere packings with a @xmath0 satisfying conditions ( [ condition1 ] ) , ( [ condition2 ] ) , and ( [ condition ] ) for @xmath1 in the interval @xmath24 $ ] , then a lower bound on the maximal packing fraction is given by @xmath25 .",
    "it is noteworthy that this optimization problem for sphere packings is an infinite - dimensional linear program , which is the dual of the primal linear program devised by cohn and elkies @xcite to obtain upper bounds on the maximal packing fraction @xcite .",
    "we will comment further on this connection in the conclusions .",
    "finally , we note here that the results of the optimization of the pair correlation function given in ref .",
    "@xcite has found application in describing small - scale convective structural features of the solar surface @xcite .",
    "the nonnegativity conditions ( [ condition1 ] ) and ( [ condition2 ] ) are necessary , but generally not sufficient , for a pair correlation function at a given density to be realizable by a point process @xcite .",
    "a third condition , obtained by yamada @xcite and not included in the optimization procedure described above , constrains @xmath26 , which is the variance in the number of points @xmath27 contained within a window @xmath28 ; @xmath29 , \\label{condition3}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the fractional part of the expected number of points contained within the window .",
    "the number variance associated with a spherical window of radius @xmath31 for a statistically homogeneous point process in @xmath8 dimensions can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath32 \\geq \\theta(r)\\big[1 - \\theta(r)\\big ] , \\label{sigmasquared}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the volume of the window and @xmath34 the intersection volume of two windows of radius @xmath31 ( whose centers are separated by @xmath35 ) divided by @xmath33 .",
    "this additional condition ( [ sigmasquared ] ) on the pair correlation function is always satisfied for statistically homogeneous and isotropic packings with sufficiently large windows in dimensions greater than 1 @xcite . in all cases that have been studied ,",
    "this condition is satisfied for all @xmath31 if the first two conditions are satisfied @xcite .",
    "while conditions ( [ condition1 ] ) , ( [ condition2 ] ) , and ( [ condition3 ] ) are necessary for the realizability of point processes , along with incorporation in @xmath7 of the core exclusion feature , they appear to be rather strong conditions for realizability of sphere packings , especially as the space dimension increases @xcite .",
    "for example , a method to construct disordered packing configurations that realize test @xmath0 s meeting the conditions and incorporating the features of core exclusion and contact pairs [ eqs .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) and ( [ g2 ] ) ] has been successful @xcite in two and three dimensions .",

    "( [ g1 ] ) , ( [ g2 ] ) , and ( [ g3 ] ) ] had been considered .",
    "the problem of finding the terminal packing fraction @xmath36 was posed as an optimization problem : maximize @xmath1 over the set of parameters subject to the first two realizability conditions ( the third condition due to yamada was not relevant ) . in this work , we consider a broader family of smooth @xmath0 test functions corresponding to disordered packings @xcite and satisfying all three aforementioned conditions .    to demonstrate the absence of a theoretical upper limit on disordered packings , we show that terms decaying as @xmath4 , representative of a feature prominent in the pair correlation functions of maximally random jammed ( mrj ) packings @xcite , allow for increased packing fraction for pair correlation functions satisfying the three conditions and incorporating the aforementioned features .",
    "a simple 11-parameter form consisting of the initial five - parameter form plus two sinusoids decaying as @xmath4 permits a packing fraction of 0.6850 . using a translational order metric",
    ", we show that the pair correlation function with the highest packing fraction also exhibits the highest degree of order , which is consistent with the conclusions of a previous work @xcite .",
    "additionally we show the surprising result that the continued addition of terms decaying as @xmath4 allows for packing fractions up to @xmath5 , indicating that , if the packings are realizable , the progression of disordered packings up to the maximum @xmath1 is a continuum , dependent only on the form and parameters of the functions employed . a qualitative description of a realizable disordered packing with smooth @xmath7 and @xmath1 approaching @xmath5 is provided in section iv a.",
    "we begin by revisiting the optimization problem first examined in ref . @xcite .",
    "we employ a more comprehensive search using simulated annealing to optimize the five parameters of the family of @xmath0 s presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and find a higher terminal packing fraction @xmath37 0.64268 .",
    "the three functions that comprise the five parameter family , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , capture the most salient properties of a disordered packing , including that the average number of spheres in contact is @xmath2 and that no sphere centers may approach closer than a distance of one sphere diameter .",
    "a heaviside step function represents the spheres hard core exclusion , @xmath41 where we set the diameter of the spheres to be unity .",
    "the heaviside step function @xmath42 is defined piecewise as @xmath43 a dirac delta function represents pair contacts , @xmath44 with @xmath2 the average number of contacts per sphere ( average kissing number ) .",
    "an exponentially decaying sinusoid provides short - range oscillatory motion about unity : @xmath45 with parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the total pair correlation function @xmath7 is then @xmath50 constraining @xmath51 , @xmath52 ensures a physical configuration , while constraining @xmath53 , @xmath54 eliminates function duplicates without additionally constraining the range of the functional form .",
    "packing fraction is maximized using the @xmath0-invariant method in 20,000 independent runs of over 10,000 iterations each .",
    "initial parameters are confined to the following bounds , and selected randomly before each run with exponentially decreasing probability from zero : @xmath55 parameters are allowed to range outside of bounds , but in no cases of the 20,000 did this occur .",
    "using @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 to represent @xmath59 times the second term on the right hand side of relation ( [ structfact2 ] ) with @xmath60 , the structure factor for the functions becomes @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "the exact analytical forms for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are included in appendix b.    the method to maximize @xmath1 relies upon a simple principal . if @xmath66 at some point @xmath67 and @xmath68 , while @xmath69 for all other points @xmath70 , then @xmath1 is at a global maximum for the given five parameters , i.e. , @xmath71 .",
    "hence to maximize @xmath14 , @xmath15 is analytically calculated from the pair correlation function in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ fourierradialstructfact ] ) , and for each random step along one of the five parameters , if possible @xmath1 is chosen such that the structure factor is in accordance with this principal . if obeying the structure factor condition is not mathematically possible for the parameter set , if the pair correlation function @xmath7 is not greater than or equal to zero for all @xmath12 , or if the maximum @xmath1 for the set does not meet the standard temperature - dependent simulated annealing condition for accepting a move , the random step is rejected and a new step chosen .",
    "figures [ simplemaxphi1 ] and [ simplemaxphi2 ] present pair correlation functions and corresponding structure factors that yield terminal packing fractions @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . parameters for high packing - fraction results were similar in period @xmath48 , phase @xmath49 , and average kissing number @xmath2 , but varied in amplitude @xmath46 and damping factor @xmath47 .",
    "for example , the @xmath7 with the highest two terminal packing fractions , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , exhibited @xmath74 and @xmath75 , with @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "each @xmath7 exhibits a minimum near @xmath78 , with the minimum for the highest packing fraction equal to zero , and a maximum at @xmath79 of about @xmath80 , suggesting that these traits , along with a period @xmath81 of about @xmath82 and a phase @xmath49 of about @xmath83 are important in obtaining the maximum packing fraction for this functional form .",
    "further analysis indicates that the period and existence of a deep minimum within @xmath84 remain important in maximizing packing fraction when other elements are added to this functional form .",
    "maximum packing - fraction @xmath0 s for this functional form do not correspond to @xmath0 s that maximize average kissing number , as is the general case for sphere packings in many dimensions @xcite . moreover , though the average kissing number for the highest possible packing fraction ( fcc lattice ) is 12 @xcite , the proved maximum possible , @xmath2 may only obtain the value of 9.5401 for this form . as will be seen later , as additional elements and parameters are added to this form and optimized for maximum packing fraction , average kissing number increases substantially .",
    "it is of interest therefore to maximize @xmath2 with packing fraction @xmath1 as a parameter .",
    "the method employed is the same as before : simulated annealing in 20,000 independent runs .",
    "figure [ simplemaxzgr ] shows the pair correlation function for the optimal parameters @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath1 , with optimized @xmath85 .",
    "most notably , the packing fraction associated with the maximum average kissing number configuration is 0.631 , nearly equal to the maximum packing fraction achieved ( @xmath72 ) for this functional form .",
    "the fact that many more spheres are in contact ( relative to the case in which the packing fraction is maximized , where @xmath86 ) , could reflect the presence of large clusters in the packing or even a sample - spanning cluster @xcite . also of note is that the first minimum , while still equal to zero , has moved inwards toward @xmath79 , and that the value of the pair correlation function at @xmath87 , @xmath88 , is much smaller than before , where the notation @xmath89 refers to the right hand limit of @xmath7 as @xmath90 .",
    "these features must be present with an average kissing number near 12 , as the integral of @xmath7 from @xmath91 to a given @xmath31 is related to the number of sphere centers most likely to be found in that range of distances , and for a realizable packing , this number can not exceed 12 for @xmath31 near unity . specifically , @xmath92 , the total expected number of sphere centers to be found within a ( larger ) sphere of radius @xmath31 centered on an arbitrary sphere center within the packing , can be written @xmath93 where the average of @xmath92 as @xmath94 from the right ( @xmath89 ) is equivalent to the average kissing number @xmath2 .",
    "generally , @xmath92 can not exceed some @xmath95 , where @xmath95 represents the maximum number of sphere centers that can be placed within a ( larger ) sphere of radius @xmath31 centered on an arbitrary sphere center .",
    "it is clear from geometric considerations that @xmath95 is a piecewise continuous nowhere decreasing function of @xmath31 . as the maximum number of congruent spheres that can be placed around a congruent central sphere is 12",
    ", @xmath95 is @xmath96 on the interval @xmath97 for some small deterministic parameter @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the distance from unity to the first discontinuity in @xmath95 .",
    "currently , @xmath99 is not known rigorously , though its value is suspected to be about @xmath100 @xcite . that @xmath92 must be less than or equal to @xmath95 for all @xmath31",
    "is another necessary realizability condition for @xmath0 s representing sphere packings .",
    "more will be said about this condition in the conclusions .",
    "it is also of note that the damping parameter @xmath47 for the maximum average kissing number case is much larger than for the maximum packing fraction case , implying that in the maximum average kissing number case , spatial correlation decreases substantially more quickly .",
    "the configuration represented by the more heavily damped pair correlation function can be interpreted as many groups of tightly packed spheres pushed together in a random fashion , thus exhibiting a high average kissing number but little to no spatial correlation at distances greater than several sphere diameters .",
    "here we show that the addition past contact of sinusoids decaying ( to unity ) as @xmath4 , a sinusoidally modulated form of the @xmath4 decay present in pair correlation functions calculated from large - scale simulations ( @xmath101 spheres ) of mrj - like packings @xcite , to the initial five - parameter family of @xmath0 s allows for significant increase in terminal packing fraction above 0.64268 . in three dimensions ,",
    "the inverse @xmath102 power is the smallest integer power to which a pair correlation function may decay while satisfying the @xmath103 condition for representing a disordered packing .",
    "however , aside from the clues that this mathematical attribute might provide , the structural origins of the @xmath4 decay currently remain a conceptual mystery .    while the form of @xmath4 decay allows increased packing fraction , other forms , including those representative of certain other features present in mrj states , do not necessarily .",
    "in fact many other additions have been considered for this study , though from these no substantial increases in @xmath36 above the 0.64268 achieved for the five - parameter form have been obtained .",
    "this is not to say that only sinusoids decaying as @xmath4 will increase the maximum possible attainable packing fraction , just that the selection of elements is non - trivial . in particular , one feature present in mrj states , a fractional power - law divergence near @xmath79 , resulted only in a reduced value for @xmath36 .",
    "the addition of this feature is discussed in appendix b.    the method used to optimize parameters with additional forms included involves three steps .",
    "structure factors are calculated analytically from eq .",
    "( [ fourierradialstructfact ] ) as before , but to accommodate the increased processing time required to find the minima of @xmath15 due to the complexity of its analytic form , the number of points @xmath70 at which @xmath15 is calculated is initially reduced .",
    "the first step then is to find several  rough \" maximum density configurations , just as with the initial five - parameter configurations , using a reduced number of calculations with initial parameters selected as before in 10,000 independent runs .",
    "the second step is to improve upon these approximate maxima by increasing the number density of points @xmath70 calculated in @xmath15 about its minimum , in 1,000 additional runs for each rough maximum @xmath1 .",
    "the results of the second step still do not yield an exact maximum and hence the third step is to fine - tune the maximum from the second step manually , ensuring that @xmath15 and @xmath7 are indeed greater than zero for all @xmath12 and @xmath70 .",
    "sinusoids decaying as @xmath4 are highly successful in increasing maximum packing fraction beyond 0.64268 . specifically , cosine functions of the form @xmath104 are employed . adding two of these elements to the initial five - parameter form allows identification of a function obeying all conditions with a maximum packing fraction of 0.6850 , 45% closer to the packing fraction of the fcc configuration than 0.640 .",

    "[ simplemaxphi1 ] and [ simplemaxphi2 ] , the plots of the pair correlation functions for maximized packing fraction using the initial five - parameter functional form .",
    "the minimum and height just past @xmath79 must be similar for physical meaningfulness due to high average kissing number @xmath109 , while the similarities in period , phase , and decay factor indicate that a higher degree of order is maintained farther from @xmath79 .",
    "the decay factor , @xmath110 , for the 0.6850 maximum packing fraction function is in fact larger than the decay factor , @xmath76 , for the 0.64268 packing fraction function , but fast decay in the former @xmath0 function is avoided through the addition of the @xmath4 sinusoids .",
    "the average kissing number @xmath109 for the 0.6850 maximum packing fraction function is substantially higher than that obtained for the 0.6427 maximum packing fraction function .",
    "the addition of the @xmath4 elements allows not only for tighter packing of spheres ( and hence a higher @xmath2 than previously possible ) , but also for slower decay than present with an exponentially decaying function alone .",
    "this implies ( but does not prove ) that more correlation at greater distances is necessary for higher packing fraction disordered packings : a hypothesis that will be supported further later in this paper by order metric calculations .",
    "it is of note that reducing the packing fraction @xmath1 without proportionally reducing the kissing number @xmath2 quickly violates the structure factor condition .",
    "this implies that kissing numbers as high as @xmath111 can not be maintained without proportionally high densities , which is in agreement with physical intuition : average number of spheres in contact can not increase past a certain point without high enough packing fraction , though it is important to note that the converse of this statement is not true ( if a configuration is not required to be jammed ) .",
    "further supporting this notion is fig .",
    "[ maxphigr6700 ] , a graph of the pair correlation function with 10 parameters optimized to maximize @xmath1 with @xmath2 set to @xmath112 . with the four parameters of function ( [ g3 ] ) nearly the same as for the 0.6850 terminal packing fraction function but @xmath2 reduced substantially ,",
    "only a lower terminal packing fraction is possible .",
    "the amplitudes of the @xmath4 cosine elements are also substantially reduced in fig .",
    "[ maxphigr6700 ] , implying that the increase in packing fraction from 0.6700 to 0.6850 necessitates both correlation at greater distances and a substantially higher average kissing number .",
    "as will be quantified later in this paper , it follows that more order overall is required to attain the packing fraction 0.6850 ; nonetheless , the smooth correlation function past contact and swift decay to unity indicates that the configuration remains disordered as defined .    as before with the five - parameter functional form , it is of interest to maximize kissing number @xmath2 for the 11-parameter functional form ( [ dcquadtail ] ) .",
    "we find that the average kissing number can not increase much above 10.4281 .",
    "for this functional form and with realizability conditions satisfied , we see that if one of either the packing fraction or kissing number is near its maximum value , then the other must also be near its maximum .",
    "a disordered packing as defined clearly lacks the degree of order present in a periodic packing , but the degree of order within a disordered system still varies , and may be quantified . for cases of hard - sphere packings , many different methods of quantifying the order in a configuration are possible .",
    "the majority of these methods advocate the use of scalar statistical measures .",
    "some of these assume that the most ordered system is the appropriate maximally dense packing @xcite , while others do not presuppose a reference crystal state @xcite .    for our purposes , the translational order metric introduced by truskett _",
    "@xcite is convenient because it is given in terms of the total correlation function : @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the diameter of the hard spheres , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 is a selected cutoff distance @xcite .",
    "the rescaled radial coordinate @xmath117 is set such that packing fractions of varying densities will be comparable , in that the total number of sphere centers over the integration range in packings of varying densities will be the same .",

    ", we show here that the degree of order in the configurations presented is greatest for the maximum packing fraction achieved .",

    "additionally , a higher average kissing number does not necessitate higher order : the degree of order in the maximum average kissing number case of the five parameter form ( fig .",

    "[ simplemaxphi1 ] ) . here ,",
    "greater correlation at a distance is sacrificed to put more particles in contact .",
    "finally , it is of note that for the maximum packing fraction cases of the five- and 11-parameter forms , represented by the top plot of fig .",

    "first , the delta functions are replaced with smooth , sharply peaked gaussian - like curves that decay to zero at distance @xmath149 from each @xmath138 .",
    "we define the integral under each of these curves from @xmath150 to @xmath151 to be equal to the reduced @xmath148 of a fcc crystal of specified finite size .",
    "physically , this represents packing spheres of diameter 1 in a fcc arrangement , shrinking the radius of these spheres to @xmath152 , and then moving each sphere a distance of no more than @xmath153 from its initial position such that the pair correlation function of the packing near each @xmath138 has the properties just described .",
    "it is of note that the exact form of the pair correlation function is not of consequence as long as the proscribed properties are maintained .",
    "second , the @xmath148 are again altered such that the finite - size  shrunk \" fcc configuration of spheres becomes cubical in shape , with a cube of side length @xmath154 circumscribing the arrangement .",
    "finally , an infinite number of these cubes , with principal axes of the fcc - packed spheres within each cube arranged at uncorrelated angles , are packed together tightly such that each pair of parallel faces of every cube are parallel to a pair of faces on every other cube , but with each face touching four other faces ( i.e. , four other cubes ) .",
    "cubes may be tightly packed in this fashion such that they fill space , and such that the resulting pair correlation function of the spheres comprising these cubes is disordered due to the packing of the cubes and the random arrangement of the principal axes of the fcc - packed spheres within each cube",
    ".    this pair correlation function would be in practice difficult to write explicitly due to boundary effects , but this is inconsequential to the description , as all that is necessary is to illustrate that such packings exist . additionally , it is noteworthy that initially packing the spheres in each cube in arrangements equivalent to any of the barlow packings would yield an equivalent result .",
    "boundary effects become negligible as the number of cubes approaches infinity , and for increasing @xmath154 and decreasing @xmath155 , any packing fraction @xmath156 , with @xmath157 the packing fraction of a simple cubic arrangement , can be obtained .",
    "the minimal packing fraction @xmath158 is obtained when only one sphere is present in each cube .",
    "the distance @xmath155 can be made small enough for any finite - sized system of cubes such that the system exhibits physical stability when force is applied , though the pair correlation function of such a system would change ( perhaps to include delta functions ) as soon as stress and strain were present .    in this way ,",
    "as long as @xmath159 and @xmath154 is finite , a disordered packing may exhibit any packing fraction up to @xmath5 , if one accepts that the pair correlation function of the system described above , represented in the form of eq .",
    "( [ g2fourier ] ) , decays to unity at least as fast as @xmath103 and in a form such that the fourier transform of @xmath127 exists . due to this result and",
    "the others demonstrated in this paper , we state that the sequential addition and optimization of more than two sinusoidal terms of the form of expression ( [ cosquadtail ] ) will allow packing fractions greater than 0.6850 , and as the number of terms grows , the optimal packing fraction for a realizable @xmath0 is conjectured to approach @xmath5 .",
    "using the @xmath0-invariant method with @xmath0 s satisfying the three necessary , but generally not sufficient , conditions for realizability , we demonstrated without implicit reliance upon any packing methodology that packing fractions well above @xmath160 are obtainable for pair correlation functions incorporating the salient features of disordered packings .",
    "a packing fraction of 0.6850 was obtained employing a test family of @xmath0 s mimicking features observed in mrj packings , including most notably core exclusion , contact pairs , and a sinusoidal decay to unity as @xmath4 .",
    "consistent with a previous study @xcite , we found that to achieve higher packing fractions , the degree of order must increase .",
    "additionally we showed , employing a qualitative example and a revised version of a fourier integral theorem , the surprising result that a disordered packing as defined may reach packing fractions approaching @xmath5 , the maximum possible for a three - dimensional hard - sphere packing .",
    "these results support the hypothesis that continued addition and subsequent optimization of sinusoids decaying as @xmath4 ( of the form of eq .",
    "( [ cosquadtail ] ) ) will find realizable @xmath0 with higher terminal packing fractions up to ( but not reaching ) @xmath5 .",
    "the conclusion that the addition of sinusoids decaying as @xmath4 allows higher terminal packing fractions ( where the addition of other features does not necessarily ) is very relevant to the study of high - density physical and jammed disordered systems , since it demonstrates that this feature contributes significantly in allowing the systems to reach aforementioned higher densities .",
    "it is noteworthy that the @xmath4 decay to unity present in the @xmath0 s of mrj packings also characterizes @xmath0 s of high - density bose systems @xcite , ground states of fermionic systems @xcite , and models of the density distribution of the early universe @xcite , though these latter systems are not sphere packings .    in future work",
    ", we will seek to extend these results to configurations of multi - component spheres and non - spherical objects .",
    "additionally , we will investigate the structural origins of the presence of the @xmath4 decay in mrj states , and attempt to determine if in higher dimensions additions of terms consisting of sinusoids decaying as the smallest ( inverse ) integer power for which a packing remains disordered , @xmath161 , to a @xmath7 representing the salient features of a @xmath8-dimensional hard sphere system , will allow for packing fractions up to the known maximum in that dimension .",
    "moreover , we will examine the form of @xmath95 , the maximum number of sphere centers that can be placed within a ( larger ) sphere of radius @xmath31 centered on an arbitrary sphere center . a natural question to ask",
    "is whether the realizability condition @xmath162 further constrains @xmath7 beyond the three conditions ( [ condition1 ] ) , ( [ condition2 ] ) , and ( [ condition3 ] ) . the answer is in the affirmative .",
    "we have already noted that the cohn - elkies linear programming upper bound formulation @xcite is the dual of the torquato - stillinger lower bound procedure , i.e. , the @xmath0-invariant process @xcite .",
    "cohn and kumar @xcite recently proved that there is no duality gap between the primal and dual lp programs , which means both the upper and lower bounds coincide when the best test functions are employed .",
    "cohn and elkies were able to find the test functions that yield the best upper bound on the maximal packing fraction in three dimensions : a packing fraction of about 0.778 , which is well above the true maximal value .",
    "this means that there exists a test pair correlation function for the lower bound formulation that will deliver the same maximal packing fraction of 0.778 , which clearly is not realizable .",
    "it was shown elsewhere that applying the additional condition that @xmath163 must be equal to 12 up to some small positive @xmath99 beyond contact together with the best test function in the upper bound brought down the maximal packing fraction appreciably from 0.778 @xcite .",
    "this means that adding the @xmath163 condition to the corresponding best test pair correlation function will also improve the packing fraction estimate .",
    "therefore , the @xmath163 condition introduces additional information beyond that contained in the two standard nonnegativity conditions .",
    "the precise form of this additional condition has yet to be fully elucidated and will be explored in future work .",

    "evidence indicates that the addition of one of the salient features observed in mrj - like states for three - dimensional hard - sphere packings , a fractional power - law divergence near @xmath79 due to near contacts @xcite , does not increase packing fraction past that obtained from the five - parameter form .",
    "for example , the addition of the form @xmath184 with @xmath185 a cutoff parameter to the square - root power decay , to the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 discussed earlier led to no additional increase in packing fraction under maximum density parameter optimization in 10,000 independent runs .",
