    "on the other hand they explain observed phenomena such as the resistance minimum ( as a function of temperature ) in dilute magnetic alloys , i.e. the kondo effect.@xcite another impurity phenomenon that has been studied extensively is the so called fermi edge singularity.@xcite in its original incarnation , the effect refers to power law singularities in the soft - x - ray absorption , emission , and photoemmision spectra of metallic samples . as with the kondo effect,@xcite the phenomenon",

    ", we confine our attention to the equilibrium situation but consider a setup in which the spectral function has interesting features at energies away from the singularity .",
    "the setup can be realized with current technology .",
    "the system we study consists of an electron gas interacting with a two level system ( charge qubit ) .",
    "a concrete realization of the qubit could be an electron that may occupy the lowest two states of a double quantum dot.@xcite from the point of view of the electron gas , the qubit acts as a dynamic localized impurity , while from the point of view of the qubit , the electron gas acts as a dissipative environment .",

    "we assume zero temperature so that it equilibrates to the fermi - sea ground state @xmath14 of the hamiltonian @xmath15 . at time @xmath16 , the tunneling amplitude @xmath8 is then switched on , and the state @xmath3 acquires a finite lifetime .",

    "the minimum energy difference between a configuration ( of qubit plus fermi gas ) with the qubit in the state @xmath3 and one with the qubit in the state @xmath4 is @xmath24 . due to the finite lifetime @xmath25 , there is an uncertainty of order @xmath13 in the qubit level splitting . for the energy levels associated with @xmath26 to remain well - defined",

    "the source of the deviations is no longer related to band structure , but to excitations resolving the spatial structure of the scattering region .",

    "our analysis is based on the approximation of taking the limit @xmath65 and linearizing the electrons dispersion relation around the fermi level , while still taking into account the full spatial dependence of the potentials @xmath11 .",

    "hence it is destroyed if the electron phase is randomized by impurity scattering or if there is inelastic scattering .",
    "thus the increase in @xmath13 with increasing @xmath2 should persist until @xmath2 exceeds either the elastic or inelastic mean free path in the wire .",
    "of course the result is also only valid as long as @xmath192 so that excitations created by the qubit do not resolve the spatial structure of the potential .",
    "thus , the larger @xmath2 , the smaller the energy window @xmath193 in which the enhancement of @xmath13 due to mitigation of the orthogonality catastrophe can be observed .     that determines the finite @xmath24 behavior of the tunneling rate @xmath13 , as a function of @xmath24 for various couplings @xmath36 , for the potential @xmath85 of eq.[sinf ] .",
    "the dotted curve corresponds to @xmath194 , the dashed curve to @xmath195 , and the solid curve to @xmath196 .",

    "[ f1 ] ]    the tunneling rate @xmath13 is calculated by expanding the third factor in eq.[ptl ] in a taylor series in @xmath198 and fourier transforming each term separately .",

    "eq.[w ] ) with @xmath34 given by eq.[lam ] .",
    "when @xmath24 becomes of the order @xmath213 , excitations in the wire are able to resolve the spatial structure of the potential @xmath85 and @xmath62 starts deviating from simple power law behavior . in the weak coupling limit , i.e. small @xmath36 , the hypergeometric function @xmath211 reduces to @xmath214 , and @xmath13 therefore shows oscillations with period @xmath197 as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "these oscillations can be understood as being due to the resonant creation of a single particle - hole excitation with an energy that satisfies the resonance condition @xmath215 .",
    "( this condition maximizes the single particle matrix element @xmath216 , where @xmath217 and @xmath218 refer to the single particle orbitals of the hole and the excited particle respectively . )    as shown in figure [ f1 ] , the oscillations become damped as @xmath36 is increased .",

    "a large number of particle hole pairs are created .",
    "this corresponds to many charge density excitations ( created by the bosonic operators @xmath95 ) with a broad distribution of wavelengths @xmath219 . as a result there is no clear resonance any more , and the oscillations in @xmath62 are washed out .",
    "it is also instructive to investigating the regime @xmath220 . here",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the hypergeometric function is @xmath221 if we substitute this into the expression ( eq.[wl2 ] ) for @xmath13 , assuming @xmath59 , we obtain @xmath222 this is the same rate as would be obtained from a closed loop factor @xmath223 ^ 2.\\ ] ] such a closed loop factor could also be obtained by coupling the qubit to two independent chiral channels , where the potential the qubit produces in either channel equals @xmath89 of eq.[sinf ] , i.e. one of the peaks in the full potential @xmath224 .",
    "this means that , in the single channel semi - infinite wire , at energies @xmath225 , the potential @xmath226 experienced by right - moving electrons and the potential @xmath227 experienced by left - moving electrons , contribute incoherently to the rate @xmath13 , as if left - movers and right - movers belong to separate channels .",
    "could this indicate that electrons reflected at the tip of the wire have lost all memory of their in - bound encounter with the qubit by the time that they again reach the qubit on their out - bound journey ?",
    "since the electrons undergo no relaxation between encounters with the qubit , the answer is `` no '' .",
    "rather , what eq.[wbigw ] indicates , is that processes in which an individual electron wave - packet with width @xmath228 is scattered twice , once while incident on the tip , and once after being reflected at the tip , are rare and make a vanishingly small contribution to the rate @xmath62 .",
    "as stated in the introduction , @xmath13 corresponds to the exponential decay rate of the probability to find the qubit in state @xmath3 , provided that @xmath229 .",
    "we conclude this section by investigating when this inequality holds . for @xmath230",

    "thus , for @xmath234 , exponential decay with rate @xmath13 occurs for all @xmath42 , provided that @xmath238 the same regime for exponential decay as in eqs.[e1 ] and [ e2 ] was identified more rigorously by legget et al.@xcite in the context of the spin boson hamiltonian with an unstructured ohmic bath ( corresponding to @xmath204 in our system ) .",

    "we applied our general results to the example a semi - infinite wire .",
    "the qubit interacts with the wire at a point that is a distance @xmath2 from the tip of the wire . in this system we found that the tunneling rate @xmath13 could be enhanced without increasing either @xmath8 or @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath34 decreases like @xmath242 so that @xmath13 grows like @xmath183 .",
    "thus the tunneling rate @xmath13 becomes larger the further the qubit is from the tip of the wire .",
    "this effect is due to a mitigation of the orthogonality catastrophe .",

    "many particle hole excitations are created .",
    "this is known as fermi sea shake - up .",

    "one of our main results ( eq.[wl2 ] ) is an exact formula for this damping by means of fermi sea shake - up .",
    "the result is illustrated in fig.[f1 ] .",
    "we also analyzed rate @xmath13 in the @xmath246 limit and saw that here the left and right moving electrons contribute to the rate @xmath13 as if they belong to independent channels .",
    "this happens despite the fact that each electron incident on the tip encounters the qubit twice , once before being reflected at the tip , and once afterwards , and no electron relaxation occurs between qubit encounters .",
    "the result therefore indicates that processes in which an individual electron wave - packet with width @xmath228 is scattered twice , once while incident on the tip and once after being reflected at the tip , make a vanishingly small contribution to the rate @xmath62 .",
