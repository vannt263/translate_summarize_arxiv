    "not surprisingly , the literature on this problem is extensive ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "the main interest here , however , is in an algebraic approach first proposed by devlin in 1989 @xcite , which is based on the work of alwash and lloyd @xcite .",
    "the latter showed that to determine when @xmath13 , there is no loss of generality in assuming @xmath14 . specifically , starting from @xmath15 the method allows one to determine an upper bound on @xmath12 for various classes of coefficient functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "( for more recent developments along these lines , see @xcite . )",
    "the general goal of this paper is to describe the main underlying combinatorial structure behind devlin s method .",
    "this has become evident only recently due to the application of combinatorial hopf algebras in feedback control theory @xcite .",

    "let @xmath17 be the solution @xmath18 with initial condition @xmath19 and parameter functions @xmath20 . in which case , it is possible to write the solution formally as the power series @xmath21 where the @xmath22 are analytic functions satisfying @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 . for a fixed @xmath26 ,",

    "it is known that @xmath37 is equivalent to the number of limit cycles the periodic solution @xmath5 can exhibit for sufficiently small perturbations of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the main idea therefore is to set up a system of equations in terms of the functions @xmath22 in order to bound @xmath37 as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 . to do this",

    "these canonical polynomials , which devlin derives from the underlying shuffle algebra over the set of words @xmath40 from the alphabet @xmath41 , are central to the analysis . of special significance",
    "is the fact that they are related by the linear recursion @xmath42 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "for example ,    [ eq : first - few - devlin - polynomials ] @xmath45    devlin shows that this recursion yields a remarkably simple expression for the coefficient of any word @xmath46 of @xmath22 : @xmath47 where the length of the word @xmath48 is denoted @xmath49 , @xmath50 is the number of times the letter @xmath51 appears in @xmath48 , and the degree of @xmath48 is defined to be @xmath52 .",
    "for example , @xmath53 .",
    "the specific goal here is to describe the precise combinatorial nature of devlin s polynomials @xmath22 and the origin of their linear recursion .",
    "it turns out that from the point of view of connected graded hopf algebras , the @xmath22 are intimately related to the graded components of a hopf algebra antipode applied to the formal power series @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the so called ferfera series @xcite .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , this link is made by passing through control theory .",
    "this is ultimately due to the fact that the abel equation ( [ devlineq ] ) is equivalent to an output feedback equation in control theory , and the hopf algebra of output feedback is derived from the _ composition _ of iterated integrals rather than just the products of iterated integrals , which yields the shuffle algebra @xcite .",
    "this means that the primary algebraic structure at play in devlin s approach is actually not the shuffle algebra , but a fa di bruno type hopf algebra , which is defined in terms of the shuffle product but is a distinct algebraic structure .",
    "so after some preliminaries presented in section  [ sect : prelim ] , this description of the @xmath22 in terms of an antipode is developed in section  [ sect : devlin - polynomials ] .",
    "now it is a standard theorem that the antipode of every connected graded hopf algebra can be computed recursively @xcite .",
    "this fact was exploited , for example , in the authors application of the output feedback hopf algebra to compute the feedback product , a device used in control theory to describe the feedback interconnection of two fliess operators @xcite .",
    "it is shown here , however , that this specific hopf algebra has another type of antipode recursion , one that is related to derivations on the shuffle algebra and distinct from the standard recursion .",
    "this result is developed in section  [ sect : new - antipode - recursion ] .",

    "equivalently , the closed - loop system has the state space realization @xmath321 the solution to the feedback equation in integral form is @xmath322 which is equivalent to @xmath323 $ ] if @xmath310 satisfies the shuffle equation ( [ eq : feedback - eqn - e ] ) . in control",
    "theory it is most common to have @xmath324 . but from a combinatorial perspective , nothing is changed if @xmath8 is left arbitrary . in which case , this feedback system can be identified with a unity feedback system from which the next main result follows .",
    "it is useful here to define the projection @xmath325 , where @xmath326 , and @xmath327 is the set of all words in @xmath142 with degree @xmath85 .",

    "recall that the elements in the feedback group are the characters with respect to @xmath95 such that @xmath333 with @xmath334 . setting @xmath335 in ( [ eq : fomal - solution - abel - equation ] )",
    "it is clear that the solution @xmath336 of the abel equation can be identified with the output of state space realization ( [ devlinsystemstate ] ) .",
    "since this system has a fliess operator representation with generating series @xmath337 as per ( [ eq : generating - series - unity - feedback - system ] ) , the claim follows immediately .",
    "suppose @xmath338 .",
    "then @xmath339 and from it follows that @xmath340 which agrees with .",
    "if the only goal is to simply compute the coefficients of the polynomials @xmath22 , control theorists will recognize a more direct route using the realization ( [ devlinsystemstate ] ) .",
    "consider any input - output map @xmath311 $ ] with a finite dimensional control - affine state space realization of the form @xmath341 where each @xmath342 and @xmath84 is an analytic vector field and function , respectively , on some neighborhood @xmath343 of @xmath344 .",
    "then the generating series @xmath172 can be differentially generated from the vector fields via @xmath345 where @xmath346 the _ lie derivative _ of @xmath84 with respect to @xmath342 is defined as @xmath347 and @xmath348 @xcite .",
    "therefore , setting @xmath349 and @xmath350 , formula ( [ eq : devlin - coefficients ] ) follows immediately .",
    "while this approach does not provide any direct insight into the underlying combinatorial structures that are present , it does inspire the new general antipode recursion described in the next section .",
    "this is somewhat surprising given that not every @xmath351 has _ local coordinates _ in the sense that it is differentially generated by a set of vector fields @xcite .",
    "given the standard antipode recursions in theorem  [ th : antipode - induction ] for connected graded hopf algebras and the identity in theorem  [ thm : devlin - polynomials ] relating devlin s polynomials to such an antipode , it seems plausible that devlin s recursion ( [ eq : devlin - recursion ] ) is simply one such antipode recursion in some specific form .",
    "interestingly , this appears not to be the case . in light of lemma  [ le : tilde - delta - inductions ] , it is clear that the left - augmentation maps play a key role in the standard antipode recursions , but in this section a different antipode recursion will be developed , one in which the right - augmentation map is the main player .",
    "not only can this new recursion be linked directly to ( [ eq : devlin - recursion ] ) , as described in the next section , but it also provides some new insights into the output feedback antipode itself as well as a simple algorithm for computer implementation .",
    "the first theorem provides an alternative to the recursion in lemma  [ le : tilde - delta - inductions ] for computing the coproduct of the output feedback hopf algebra .",
    "it is useful to introduce the multiplication map @xmath352 on @xmath95 for any @xmath167 with the defining property that @xmath353 note , in particular , that @xmath354 and @xmath355 , whereas from the leibniz rule @xmath356    for any nonempty word @xmath252 , the coproduct is given by @xmath357 where @xmath358 , @xmath359 and @xmath360    the proof is via the degree of @xmath219 . indeed , with @xmath361 and recalling that @xmath362 , it is immediate that @xmath363 so the claim holds when @xmath364 . before proceeding to the general case , it is instructive to compute a few more lower degree terms .",
    "for example , note that in several places above the parentheses in expressions such as @xmath365 have been omitted for notational simplicity .",
    "the same simplification is applied when convenient further below .",
    "now assume that ( [ def : fullcoprod2 ] ) holds up to some fixed degree @xmath366 .",
    "the following compact notation @xmath367 is used .",
    "there are two cases to consider .",
    "first suppose that @xmath368 so that @xmath369 , @xmath248 . using and lemma  [ le : tilde - delta - inductions ] , it is clear that @xmath370 employing , in addition , the induction hypothesis , the identity @xmath371 , and the fact that the left- and right - augmentation operators commute on @xmath229 , i.e. , @xmath254 for @xmath255 , it then follows that now suppose instead that @xmath372 so that @xmath373 , @xmath248 .",
    "sweedler s notation for the deshuffling coproduct , i.e. , @xmath260 , is useful here .",
    "analogous to the previous case , observe applying the leibniz rule for the right - augmentation operator @xmath374 to the product @xmath375 gives which proves the theorem .",
    "the new coproduct formula above provides a simple recursive formula for the antipode of the output feedback hopf algebra @xmath95 .",
    "this is the main result of this section .",
    "[ prop : antipodespecial ] for any nonempty word @xmath252 , the antipode @xmath96 in theorem  [ th : output - feedback - ha ] can be written as @xmath376 where @xmath377 is the length of the word @xmath48 , and @xmath378 with @xmath379 and @xmath380    the proof is via induction on the degree of @xmath219 .",
    "the degree one case is excluded by assumption . for degree two and three it",
    "is quickly verified that @xmath381 and @xmath382 now assume the theorem holds up to degree @xmath383 , and suppose @xmath384 .",
    "there are multiple cases to address . using sweedler s notation for",
    "the reduced coproduct @xmath385 first consider the antipode @xmath386 . by definition of the coproduct",
    ", the letter @xmath39 appears always as the last letter in one of the factors in the sum @xmath387 , which therefore splits as @xmath388 here the sum notation @xmath389 will indicate that the reduced coproduct of @xmath48 is being used .",
    "recall that in @xmath390 , @xmath391 , whereas the term @xmath392 may be a monomial .",
    "furthermore , @xmath393 means that @xmath39 appears as the last letter in exactly one of the factors of this monomial .",
    "thus , now the second case is considered , namely the antipode @xmath394 .",
    "analogous to the previous case , the suffix @xmath38 can be attached to the left or right factor in the term @xmath395 .",
    "however , due to the particular nature of the letter @xmath38 , there is a third case , that is , when @xmath38 as the last letter in a word is _ split _ according to the coproduct @xmath396 .",
    "the calculation to show that @xmath397 goes as follows .",
    "first observe that applying the leibniz rule yields note in the final step above , the following identity was employed , which is a consequence of the induction hypothesis .",
    "namely , the calculation is completed via the observation that line multiplied by @xmath398 implies that @xmath399 can be rearranged as @xmath400 therefore , which implies that @xmath401 . to see that the right - hand side of the last equality is equivalent to @xmath402 , simply expand the latter using the standard antipode recursion defined in terms of the coproduct characterized in lemma [ le : tilde - delta - inductions ] .",
    "an elementary application of this theorem is the following corollary , which essentially states that the coefficients of the antipode for coordinate functions ending in the letter @xmath38 always sum to zero .",
    "for example , @xmath403 , so that @xmath404 .",
    "this claim is not so obvious when approached by other means .",
    "[ co : berlin - identity ] for any @xmath167 , @xmath405 .",
    "observe @xmath406    finally , it worth pointing out that the multivariable generalization of theorem  [ prop : antipodespecial ] is straightforward .",
    "in this situation , each coordinate function is given a superscript to indicate which component of the generating series @xmath407 it is associated with , i.e. , @xmath408 where @xmath409 and @xmath167 with the alphabet @xmath294 . in which case , the statement of the generalized proposition is identical to the current version except for the maps @xmath410 and @xmath411",
    "in this section it is shown that devlin s recursion ( [ eq : devlin - recursion ] ) follows from the solution of the abel equation ( [ eq : devlineq - without - gamma ] ) when written in terms of the output feedback antipode , that is , by combining theorem  [ thm : devlin - polynomials ] and proposition  [ prop : antipodespecial ] .",
    "the main step in creating this link is the following theorem .",
    "this last corollary implies that the calculation of the coefficient @xmath421 reduces to evaluating certain polynomials in only the coordinate functions @xmath422 and @xmath398 against the series @xmath54 .",
    "for instance , so the coordinate functions involving the letter @xmath38 play no role in the calculation .    the proof of the main result is accomplished by considering the adjoint of the right - augmentation map . note that for any word @xmath423 it follows that @xmath424 .",
    "therefore , the adjoint of the right - augmentation map @xmath425 is @xmath426 so that @xmath427 and zero otherwise .",
    "a key observation is that the adjoint @xmath428 acts as a coderivation , i.e. , for the feedback group element @xmath429 it satisfies @xmath430 where @xmath431 is the coproduct dual to the product @xmath37 in @xmath95 , and @xmath217 is a group - like element , i.e. , a character on @xmath95 .",
    "the proof is by induction on the degree of the coordinate functions .",
    "so the claim is first verified for @xmath432 and @xmath433 , which have degrees three and four , respectively .",
    "first observe that if @xmath434 , then @xmath435 .",
    "therefore , applying proposition  [ prop : antipodespecial ] , as well as the general identity @xmath436 ( again sweedler s notation for the reduced coproduct is used , namely , @xmath437 ) gives the following : @xmath438 for the coordinate function @xmath433 : @xmath439 now assume the identity holds up to some fixed degree @xmath440 and select @xmath48 such that @xmath441 and @xmath442 .",
    "then , using the fact that @xmath443 , observe @xmath444the case where @xmath445 reduces directly to @xmath446 , and therefore @xmath447                          a.  ferfera , combinatoire du monode libre applique  la composition et aux variations de certaines fonctionnelles issues de la thorie des systmes , doctoral dissertation , university of bordeaux i , 1979 .",
