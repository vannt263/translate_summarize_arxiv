    "in recent years , high spatial resolution observations of clusters of galaxies by _ chandra _ revealed the existence of sharp discontinuities of x - ray intensity called cold fronts ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . their existence is challenging because in high temperature plasma",
    ", high thermal conductivity quickly smears such a discontinuity in temperature .",
    "@xcite pointed out that heat conductivity across the front should be reduced from the classical spitzer value , @xmath0 @xcite by several orders of magnitude .",
    "magnetic fields enable such suppression .",
    "cold fronts may also be subject to the kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) instability .",
    "@xcite suggested that turbulent magnetic fields stretched along the cold front will reduce the growth rate of the k - h instability at the interface between a subcluster plasma and an ambient plasma .",
    "the magnetic field strength in the core of clusters of galaxies can be the order of @xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite summarized the observations of the field strength in several regions of abell 3667 by using different techniques .",
    "they showed that its strength in the cluster core is about @xmath2 , and that magnetic fields are tangled on scales of roughly @xmath3 .",
    "let us estimate the heat conduction time scale in cluster of galaxies .",
    "it has been suggested that the heat conduction in cluster of galaxies can be very efficient ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because the coulomb mean free path , @xmath4 , is large . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the number density . the time required for heat to diffuse by conduction across a length @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the density and @xmath9 is the spitzer conductivity .",
    "since the thickness of the cold front is much smaller than @xmath3 , they will disappear in a time scale shorter than @xmath10 .",
    "if magnetic fields exist , however , the characteristic length of the heat exchange across magnetic field lines is reduced to the larmor radius , @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the heat conduction across the magnetic field is almost suppressed .",
    "earlier numerical studies of cold fronts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) did not include magnetic fields and heat conduction .",
    "@xcite first reported the results of two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of cold fronts including both magnetic fields and anisotropic heat conduction .",
    "they showed that magnetic fields are stretched and elongated ahead of the front .",
    "since these magnetic fields suppress the heat conduction across them , the contact discontinuity ( a cold front ) between the cold subcluster plasma and the hot ambient plasma can be maintained .",
    "the cold subcluster is wrapped by magnetic fields and protected from being heated by the heat conduction .    in this paper , we focus on the three - dimensional ( 3d ) effects . in the 3d case ,",
    "since magnetic fields compressed in front of the cold front can expand in the third direction or slip out the front surface , the strength of the magnetic fields in this region may be reduced compared to that in the 2d case .",
    "we would like to show that even when we include these 3d effects , cold fronts can be maintained .",

    "@xcite showed that in models without heat conduction and without magnetic fields , the growth of the k - h instability is not prominent and does not disrupt the cold front ahead of the moving subcluster . in the sides of the subcluster , the k - h instability creates eddies which detach and propagate downstream .",

    "they showed that magnetic fields accumulating ahead of the cloud triggers the rayleigh - taylor ( r - t ) instability and disrupts the cloud .",
    "our numerical results , however , does not show the growth of such r - t instability .",
    "these different behaviors are due to a difference of the density distribution of the cloud .",
    "since the subcluster plasma in our simulations has a dense core because it is confined by the gravity , magnetic fields ahead of the clump can not deform the density distribution inside the subcluster .",
    "we have shown that in the 3d case , since magnetic fields ahead of the subcluster slip along the contact surface between the subcluster plasma and the ambient plasma , the amplification of their strength is smaller than that in the 2d case",
    ". this weaker magnetic field , however , is sufficient to suppress the heat conduction across the front .    since the area of the contact surface is larger in the 3d case than that in the 2d case .",
    "thus cold subcluster plasma can be heated more efficiently than in the 2d case .",
    "we confirmed this by comparing results for model hc2 and hc3 ( figure [ fig : f6 ] ) . compared with model",
