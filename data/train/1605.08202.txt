    "it is a well known fact , that the spatial probability density distribution in quantum mechanics for low lying states entirely disagrees with the distribution found in classical mechanics .",
    "for instance the ground state wave - function of the harmonic oscillator  and the probability density as well  has a gaussian character with a strong maximum around the center of the force , whereas the classical probability density acquires the largest values ( or , more precisely , diverges as the inverse square root ) close to the turning points .",
    "there is nothing strange in this behavior : the classical probability for finding the particle in a certain interval @xmath0 $ ] is proportional to the time spent within it , i.e. to @xmath1 .",
    "close to the turning points the particle velocity approaches zero so the probability density infinitely increases .",
    "the common explanation of this discrepancy is that the quantum - mechanical ground state of certain energy @xmath2 ( which is nonzero due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle ) does not correspond to the classical state of the same energy  @xcite .",
    "the classical ground state is a state of a particle at rest ( i.e. of zero energy ) and , as such , is represented by the dirac delta function @xmath3 , and not that describing a particle bouncing between the walls .",
    "the disagreement between quantum and classical probability distributions is not so severe for high energy states . a well known picture of this phenomenon for the harmonic oscillator is presented in fig .",
    "[ oscold ] . the subsequent quantum probability density plots for increasing quantum number @xmath4 ( drawn in black lines ) more and more approach",
    " after the appropriate averaging  the classical distribution ( gray lines ) .",
    "this effect constitutes the subject of the _ correspondence principle _ @xcite , which in the widely accepted although not unanimous @xcite formulation states , that the predictions of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics should agree for @xmath5 .",
    "similar results are obtained for other potentials  @xcite .",
    "it was admittedly shown , in the spirit of the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics , that the moments for canonical variables do agree in both cases  @xcite , but the spatial distributions of the probability density remain dissonant . the other approach consisted in considering a localized wave - packet , representing the trapped particle , bouncing between cavity walls  @xcite .",
    "however such a wave - packet , of the size much smaller than that of the cavity , corresponds to the particle motion with a relatively high energy , certainly much larger than that of ground state .",
    "this model is , therefore , related to the situation of the last plot of fig .",
    "[ oscold ] , for which the compliance between classical and quantum results does not raise any doubt , and not with the first one , we are interested in .",
    "a low - energy wave - packet should have an extent comparable to the cavity size .",
    "in  @xcite the idea of the averaging of the classical probability density over various classical states ( i.e. states with different energies ) was formulated .",
    "the obtained result is in rough agreement with quantum distribution  in particular the divergences close to the turning points are removed .",
    "however the incorporation of the uncertainty principle for the concrete classical state  in the way suggested below  instead of smearing the probability over different states , seems to be conceptually more justifiable and leads to much more accurate results .",
    "the aim of this paper is then to show that the incompatibilities between probabilities in classical and quantum mechanics may be strongly reduced or even eliminated with the use of the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "it is the most essential ingredient of quantum mechanics  some kind of its cornerstone  and it constitutes the source of the fundamental distinctions between classical and quantum physics . therefore it has to be inevitably included in our considerations if we want to reproduce quantum results even approximately .",
    "below we show , that actually one can relatively easily obtain the agreement between classical and quantum probability distributions , even for the ground state , if one incorporates into the former the uncertainty relation between position and momentum in the qualitative form : @xmath6 no other quantum postulates are necessary .",
    "we use the classical distributions and simply smear them according to  ( [ ur ] ) , obtaining that way the corrected distributions .",
    "we would like to emphasize , that throughout this paper we concentrate solely on ground states , since the agreement for highly excited states is well established and commonly accepted .",
    "in contrast , the ground state is viewed as purely quantum and it is worth specifying the conditions under which it remains in harmony with the classic one . this relation ( [ ur ] )  what may seem surprising while looking at the first plot of fig.[oscold ]  turns out to be sufficient to transform the gray line into the black one with a relatively good approximation .",
    "the main idea of this work is formulated in the next section . in the following section we consider first the quantum and classical distributions for ground states of certain simple one - dimensional mechanical systems : the harmonic oscillator , the particle in gravitational potential ( or in uniform electric field ) , in morse potential and in some special potential and next try to generalize the method for the multidimensional cases : the hydrogen atom and two - dimensional asymmetric harmonic oscillator .",
    "we start with determining the classical probability distributions in these cases and then modify them by including the uncertainty principle .",
    "these modified distributions are then compared with quantum ones .",
    "in the usual approach the classical probability density @xmath7 for the bound system in one dimension is defined as ratio of the time spent by a moving particle in the interval @xmath0 $ ] to the total time @xmath8 needed to move between turning points ( half of the period ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the velocity at a given point @xmath11 .",
    "close to the turning points , where the particle decelerates to zero , @xmath7 diverges . on the other hand the quantum probability density @xmath12 for the ground state",
    "has a maximum in the middle of the potential cavity .",
    "these two functions substantially differ , as may be seen on the first plot of fig .",
    "[ oscold ] .",
    "the main idea of the present work is to _ slightly _ modify the classical distribution in order to embody the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "we would like to stress that the modification we wish to introduce should be very simple .",
    "we treat it as an essential ingredient of the proposed approach .",
    "we do not want to create a sophisticated procedure to improve @xmath7 in order to create the new ` classical ' distribution , which would be as complicated as solving schrdinger equation itself , but our purpose is to show , that when the uncertainty principle is incorporated even in the trivial and elementary manner , the discrepancy between the new probability @xmath13 and @xmath12 becomes minor in large space area .",
    "the idea formulated below is based on the behavior of the quantum bouncer in the harmonic potential and in other potentials .",
    "it is known , that the high energy wave - packet is a superposition of the large spectrum of stationary oscillator states .",
    "close to the turning points , when kinetic energy decreases , the long wavelength components are subject to the interference , which results in the reduction of tails and enhancement of the peak height  @xcite , similarly as the superposition of plane waves can lead to the dirac function @xmath3 . for low - energy wave - packets the number of superposed states is strongly reduced and such an interference does not take place .",
    "contrary , due to the decreasing kinetic energy de broglie wavelength increases and the wave - packet broadens .",
    "this effect is well illustrated in  @xcite .",
    "the classical particle behaves like high - energy wave - packet .",
    "but for low lying states the uncertainty relation compensates the behavior resulting from  ( [ pcl ] ) .",
    "if the classical point particle  according to ehrenfest idea  @xcite  is to be promoted to the bouncing wave packet , then its position should become unknown up to a couple of the de broglie wavelengths : @xmath14 where @xmath4 is a certain positive number ( not necessarily an integer ) . to facilitate our further analysis and to allow for comparison of the results in different models , in each of the cases considered in the following section we define the dimensionless position @xmath15 and momentum @xmath16 simultaneously eliminating the dimensional constants present in every model .",
    "for these variables the uncertainty principle  ( [ ur ] ) reads @xmath17    let us now assume that @xmath18 is maximally of order of @xmath16 itself , by putting @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a certain parameter to be fixed later .",
    "the ` @xmath21 ' comes from the utmost classical values of momentum at each point : from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "it will turn out , that the optimal value of this parameter and , what should especially be pointed out , _ common _ for all considered cases ( except that in two dimensions ) is @xmath24 . now upon  ( [ db ] ) we can put @xmath25 since inside a cavity the momentum @xmath16 is in general @xmath15-dependent , the same refers to the indefiniteness of @xmath15 , which will change from point to point .    how to incorporate  ( [ urm ] ) and  ( [ uncpos ] ) into classical probability distribution ?",
    "we achieve this by assuming that the value @xmath26 is not attributed to the single point @xmath15 but to the whole ` cell ' of the spread @xmath27 around it .",
    "therefore , to the corrected probability density at a certain point do contribute all cells ( potentially with different weights ) , that contain it .",
    "we introduce below a certain function @xmath28 , which specifies in what way the value @xmath29 is distributed within such an elementary cell .",
    "the most natural will be to choose it in the gaussian form , but we start with the trivial case of a properly normalized constant in the whole interval ( throughout the paper this interval will be called ` the uncertainty cell ' ) : @xmath30 , \\label{interval}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 the size of this interval changes together with @xmath32 and becomes larger close to the turning points .",
    "we then first define the function @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the characteristic function of the set @xmath36 , and next @xmath37 it obviously satisfies @xmath38    the new probability distribution is now created as the sum ( or rather integral ) over contributions coming from each cell ( the integral over @xmath32 is in fact the integral over different cells ) @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the turning points of the bouncing particle .",
    "this formula constitutes our main instrument in the following section .",
    "the function @xmath28 has an interesting property : integrated over first argument gives the old probability distribution @xmath42 , while integration over the second one leads to the improved distribution @xmath43 .",
    "the choice of the function @xmath44 as given by  ( [ phi ] ) is the simplest one , but as we shall see below , already in this form it is sufficient to reproduce relatively well the quantum probability distribution of the ground states , except for certain small regions .",
    "our goal is to use , however , the gaussian form of @xmath33 , for which the results are still better .",
    "in this section we apply our formula  ( [ prob ] ) to a couple of simple one - dimensional quantum - mechanical systems .",
    "we begin with the harmonic oscillator and continue with other examples for which the quantum solutions are well known .",
    "let us consider classical one - dimensional system described by the hamiltonian @xmath45 the ground state energy of the quantum version of the system is @xmath46 .",

    "this result should be compared with the quantum probability distribution for ground state , which is well known  @xcite , and has the form : @xmath58    in fig .",
    "[ osc1 ] the modified probability distribution @xmath13 is plotted with solid line . except for the middle of the cavity it perfectly agrees with the quantum distribution @xmath59 plotted with dashed line .",

    "it is noticeable that the best fit here and for _ all _ following curves corresponds to the value @xmath24 .",
    "the unmodified classical distribution @xmath26 for the same energy is shown in gray color .",
    "this result demonstrates the fundamental role played by uncertainty principle .",
    "the inclusion of it even in the rough form is enough to obtain nearly perfect agreement in large areas .",
    "the visible deviation from the quantum result in the center may be explained by the coarse form of  ( [ phi ] ) , which is a constant within the interval @xmath36 . for small values of @xmath15 , where the momentum @xmath60 becomes relatively large , its indefiniteness is overestimated .",

    "the quantum probability density can be obtained by separation of variables in the schrdinger equation and is a product of one - dimensional densities : @xmath157 in the dimensionless variables    [ xixy ] @xmath158    it may be given a rotationally symmetric ( in the plane @xmath159 ) form @xmath160    let us define the auxiliary angle @xmath161 , which specifies the asymmetry of the potential @xmath162 considering classical motion of energy @xmath2 , corresponding to that of the quantum ground state , we can define two dimensionless energies , which will be useful , and the corresponding dimensionless times :    [ tet ] @xmath163    inserting the ground state energy @xmath164 , one obtains @xmath165 and @xmath166 . to find the classical probability density we have to know the particle velocity at each point of the classically allowed region .",
    "to this goal it is convenient to introduce new variables , as    [ 2da ] @xmath167    eq .  ( [ hoscas ] ) may now be given the form : @xmath168 from which one gets @xmath169 where @xmath170 , and @xmath171 being the polar coordinates in the plane @xmath172 .",
    "it should be noted , that the transition from the initial cartesian coordinates to the present ones leads to the jacobian merely equal to a constant , which disappears when the probability is normalized to unity .",
    "due to the symmetry of  ( [ hti ] ) the classical probability density is @xmath173 independent , and therefore may be written as @xmath174 where @xmath175 is certain constant to be fixed from the probability normalization condition .",
    "coming back to the variables @xmath176 , we obtain @xmath177 where the additional factor in the denominator comes from the jacobian .",
    "integration over whole allowed region leads to @xmath178    it is obvious from  ( [ pcl2dt ] ) that @xmath42 is rotationally invariant only in the plane @xmath172 , and not @xmath159 , where level sets are rather ellipses , and the major contribution for the probability comes from the vicinity of the curve @xmath179 . the shape @xmath180 is shown on the first plot of fig .  [ osc2d ] .",
    "the visible enhancement of the classical probability close to the origin is connected with the fact , that for various trajectories the particle approaches very often the cavity center and therefore it becomes more probable to be found there .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ tr2d ] , where the compilation of @xmath181 exemplary random trajectories is presented . in turn on this graph the increased probability on the perimeter",
    "is not exposed , since it is connected with the particle velocity and not its position .",
    "the distribution of @xmath42 is in strong contradiction with the quantum probability @xmath182 ( shown on the second plot of fig .",
    "[ osc2d ] ) , which has gaussian character and in these variables is rotationally invariant .",
    "now we are in the position to apply our scheme to verify , whether it leads the ( almost ) quantum distribution . due to the multidimensional nature of our problem",
    ", it requires some small modifications .",
    "first , to define the generalization of the function  ( [ xipm ] ) , we need two uncertainties @xmath183 and @xmath184 . they are connected with the velocities @xmath185 and @xmath186 at a given point , but these are unknown . from the energy equation  ( [ hti ] ) we obtain only @xmath187 , but the direction of the motion  and simultaneously @xmath183 and @xmath184 at each point  is unspecified and depends on the initial conditions .",
    "therefore we introduce a certain angle @xmath125 , which defines this direction . for any fixed @xmath125 the values of @xmath183 and @xmath184 become known and the final probability distribution will be that obtained by averaging over possible directions .",
    "this angle averaging refers to the initial state of the classical particle only and should not be confused with the directions in the harmonic potential : the trap does not change it shape as given by  ( [ hoscas ] ) . in this way we have    [ pre ]",
    "latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }        and we can define the generalization of the function @xmath44 given by  ( [ phi ] ) : @xmath189 as before , @xmath190 is the characteristic function of the interval @xmath191 , \\label{interval1}\\ ] ] where @xmath192 and similarly for @xmath193 .",
    "now the improved probability density amplitude may be defined by the simple generalization of the formulas  ( [ pphi ] ) and  ( [ prob ] ) : @xmath194 and @xmath195 where by @xmath196 we denoted the classically allowed region , i.e. the ellipse defined by the condition @xmath197 .",
    "if we preferred a gaussian distribution of probability within the uncertainty cell , we would use , instead of  ( [ pphi1 ] ) , the obvious generalization of  ( [ posc3 ] ) : @xmath198    in fig .",
    "[ osc2d ] we draw the improved probability distribution @xmath199 obtained with the use of  ( [ posc31 ] ) , for the value of parameter @xmath200 ( this gives slightly better agreement than the ` one - dimensional value ' @xmath72 ) and compare it to the quantum probability @xmath201 .",
    "the obtained result turns out again to be noteworthy .",
    "the main features and even the rotationally invariant character of @xmath182 in the variables @xmath176 have been approximately restored from  ( [ pcl2d ] ) thanks to the application of the uncertainty relation .",
    "in the present paper we proposed a simple way to improve the classical probability density distribution , by incorporating the heisenberg uncertainty principle in order to make it consistent with the quantum distribution .",
    "it is based on the picture of a wave packet bouncing between classical turning points .",
    "we concentrated on the ground states for which the discrepancy between classical and quantum results was the most severe .",
    "the procedure was tested for various one - dimensional quantum - mechanical models : harmonic oscillator , linear ( gravitational ) potential , morse potential and some special potential , as well as for models in more than one dimension : the hydrogen atom and asymmetric harmonic oscillator .",
    "they all show the unexpectedly good agreement between the improved distribution and the quantum one .",
    "this is all the more noteworthy that the proposed modification is very simple if not trivial .    in the region of large particle momenta , the agreement is not so good , but it was shown , that further improvements may be easily achieved by the slight and still simple modification of the classical probability distribution within the uncertainty cell .",
    "after this modification the obtained results are satisfactory for all tested potentials and for the whole space .",
    "the comparison of all plots reveals one feature in common : the probability is slightly underestimated in the center of cavity and slightly overestimated far from it .",
    "this is a consequence of our simple assumption  ( [ uncpos ] ) and entails a little larger values for the variance @xmath202 than those found from quantum distribution . in some small limits  ( [ six ] ) may be modified by the choice of parameter @xmath71 , whose value ( mostly @xmath24 ) was fixed to obtain the _ visual _ agreement between @xmath61 and @xmath59 .    one might have a hope that for the determination of the approximate probability distribution one does not necessarily have to go through the often complicated process of finding the quantum state , but sufficient is the knowledge of the classical motion and of the uncertainty principle .",
    "the solving of ordinary differential equations describing the classical motion of a particle should be numerically much more efficient than that of the partial schrdinger differential equation , for instance with the use of the monte carlo methods .",
    "the presented idea seems promising and should be tested for more complicated cases , also going beyond the simple non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "what is required , is the knowledge of velocities or momenta at each classically allowed point , which , at least at the numerical level , should be available . at the same time",
    "the method confirms the fundamental role played in quantum mechanics by the uncertainty principle .",
    "the comparison of classical and quantum results allows for better understanding of the underlying physics and especially the connection between quantum mechanics and the macroscopic world .",
