    "interference management is a crucial problem in wireless communications . over the past decade",
    ", there has been a great deal of research to characterize the asymptotic capacity inner - bounds of interference channels ( ics ) using the simple notion of degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) , also known as multiplexing gain .",
    "recently , interference alignment ( ia ) @xcite has emerged as a fundamental solution to achieve the optimal degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) in several ic models .",
    "the conventional ia technique for the @xmath0-user ic @xcite and the @xmath0-user x channel @xcite is based on several strict conditions as follows .",
    "time , frequency , or space domain extension is required to render the channel model multi - dimensional . to this end ,",
    "channel randomness , i.e. , time - varying or frequency - selective channel coefficients , is needed . moreover ,",
    "an arbitrarily large size of the dimension extension is needed for @xmath0 greater than 3 , which results in an excessive bandwidth usage is required for the decoding of one signal block @xcite .",
    "in addition , global channel state information ( csi ) is needed at all nodes @xcite . for the interfering multiple - access channel ( imac ) consisting of @xmath0 cells , where each cell is composed of @xmath2 users and a single base station ( bs ) , suh and tse developed a new ia scheme to characterize the dof achievability of the @xmath0-cell imac @xcite allowing the rank of the interference space to be larger than one .",
    "the underlying idea of the ia is to align the interference to the desired interference spaces at the receivers by exploiting diversity ( i.e. , randomness ) in any resource domain . the scheme proposed in @xcite utilized the user domain resource for the ia in the imac .",
    "this ia scheme based on the user diversity leads to two interesting results .",
    "first , the dof of the interference - free network , given by @xmath0 , can be achieved as @xmath2 increases .",
    "second , the size of the time / frequency domain extension is greatly reduced .",
    "specifically , the finite size of the extension is given by @xmath8 , which is sufficient to operate for given @xmath2 .",
    "however , arbitrarily large @xmath2 is needed to attain @xmath0 dof , which results in an infinite dimension extension in the end .",
    "thus , time - varying or frequency - selective fading is still required for this scheme .",
    "recently , the concept of opportunistic interference alignment ( oia ) was introduced in @xcite , for the @xmath0-cell @xmath2-user single - input multiple - output ( simo ) imac with time - invariant channel coefficients , where each base station ( bs ) has @xmath1 antennas . in the oia technique ,",
    "opportunistic user scheduling is combined with the spatial domain ia to align the interference to predefined interference spaces at each bs by exploiting multiuser diversity .",
    "although several studies independently addressed some of the aforementioned practical problems of the conventional ia technique @xcite , the oia technique resolved these practical issues simultaneously .",
    "the oia scheme employs the spatial domain ia only with the aid of opportunistic user scheduling and thus operates with a single snapshot without any dimension extension .",
    "the purpose of the oia - related work @xcite is not only to maximize the dof as in the conventional schemes , but also to characterize the trade - off between the achievable dof and the number of users required .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the oia scheme achieves @xmath4 dof if @xmath2 scales faster than @xmath9 in a high snr regime , where @xmath10 is the number of selected users in each cell .    in this paper , we introduce an oia for the @xmath0-cell mimo imac with time - invariant channel coefficients , where each cell consists of one bs with @xmath1 antennas and @xmath2 users having @xmath3 antennas each . inheriting the basic oia principle @xcite , the proposed oia operates with local csi at the transmitterin interference channels , the local csi at the transmitter denotes the information of the channels from the transmitter to all receivers , i.e. , its own transmit links @xcite . ] , no inter - user or intercell coordination ( i.e. , distributed scheduling metric calculation ) , no dimension extension , and no iterative processing . in @xcite , the outer bound on the dof of the mimo imac with time - invariant channel coefficients was characterized , and necessary conditions for @xmath1 and @xmath3 needed to achieve the optimal dof were derived with global csi at all nodes . however , the main goal of the proposed oia is to characterize a trade - off between the achievable dof and the number of users required in the mimo imac with arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "that is , the focus is on studying the user scaling law needed to achieve the target dof , given by @xmath4 , which is optimal if @xmath11 .",
    "scaling conditions required to achieve target performance have a great impact in providing the convergence rate to the target performance with respect to considered system parameters , thus yielding an intuitive performance measure .",
    "for instance , it is common in mimo systems to evaluate limited feedback schemes by analyzing the relationship between the codebook size scaling and the rate - loss @xcite , and the concept has been applied also to mimo ics @xcite .    in the downlink cellular ic ,",
    "user scaling laws were developed for the oia @xcite and for the opportunistic interference management with limited feedback @xcite .",
    "these schemes can not be easily extended to the imac , because there exists a mismatch between generating interferences at each user and interferences suffered by each bs from multiple users , thus yielding the difficulty of user scheduling design .",
    "more specifically , we propose the following two types of oia : antenna selection - based oia and singular value decomposition ( svd)-based oia .",
    "we then derive the scaling law for required @xmath2 with respect to snr , under which @xmath4 dof can be achieved . in the proposed schemes , each selected user employs transmit beamforming to mitigate the leakage of interference ( lif ) it generates .",
    "while the alignment was performed only through user scheduling in the simo case , the transmit beamforming is used for the mimo oia to perform the spatial domain ia along with opportunistic user scheduling .",
    "moreover , the additional effort for the feedback of the weight vector from each selected user to the corresponding bs is in general required compared to the simo case , except for the proposed antenna selection - based oia .",
    "we show that for the antenna selection - based oia , where the best transmit antenna is selected at each user , required @xmath2 scales as @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the user scaling condition with respect to snr does not fundamentally change , compared with the simo imac case  @xcite , if @xmath3 is a constant independent of @xmath2 . however , the sum - rate gain of the antenna selection - based oia over the simo oia increases as @xmath3 grows , whereas no additional feedback is required . for the svd - based oia ,",
    "each user designs the weight vector that minimizes the leakage of interference ( lif ) using svd - based beamforming .",
    "we show that the svd - based oia can greatly reduce the user scaling condition to @xmath13 with the help of the high - rate feedback .",
    "our schemes are compared with the existing ia schemes for multiuser ics , and computer simulations are provided to validate the derived scaling laws . from this study , besides the fundamental trade - off between the user scaling condition and the achievable dof , we examine that in the mimo imac , there also exists a trade - off between the amount of feedback for the weight vectors and the user scaling condition .",
