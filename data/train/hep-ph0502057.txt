    "@xmath3-meson decays are an excellent source of information about the ckm mechanism and allow us to test our understanding of the cp violation . in nonleptonic",
    "@xmath3 decays we must deal with final states interactions ( fsi ) as well , since they may modify the values of the extracted parameters .",
    "it is hard to take fsi into consideration properly since there are a lot of possible decay channels .",
    "+ during the recent years several authors have investigated various possible corrections due to fsi .",
    "most of the analyses take into account the elastic and inelastic effects arising from intermediate states containing light quarks ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) [ 1 - 6 ] and apply symmetries of strong interactions ( isospin , su(3 ) ) to reduce the number of parameters .",
    "some authors argued that intermediate states containing charmed quarks ( @xmath7 ) may also play an important role [ 7 - 13 ] .",
    "+ in the present paper we analyse @xmath3 decays into two light noncharmed pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "we consider fsi originating only from the intermediate states containing c quarks . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we introduce our parametrisation and relations between the amplitudes .",
    "section 4 contains the description of the fit procedure and our results together with the cp asymmetry predictions .",
    "finally , a short summary is given in section 5 .",
    "the decays of @xmath3 meson into two noncharmed pseudoscalar mesons are characterised by 10 @xmath8 invariant amplitudes corresponding to the specific quark - line diagrams . as in @xcite",
    "we use four dominant amplitudes : tree @xmath9 , colour - suppressed @xmath10 , penguin @xmath11 and singlet penguin @xmath12 .",
    "unprimed ( primed ) amplitudes denote strangeness conserving ( violating ) processes and are related to each other .",
    "topological decompositions of decay amplitudes can be found in @xcite .",
    "+ we use the wolfenstein parameters : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite . all relations bellow",
    "are calculated up to @xmath17 unless explicitly written otherwise .",
    "terms proportional to @xmath18 are kept on account of complex factor in @xmath19 , which may interfere with fsi correction .",
    "we assume that all short - distance ( sd ) strong phases are negligible . for the tree amplitude",
    "we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the su(3 ) breaking factor .",
    "both @xmath22 and @xmath23 amplitudes have a weak phase equal @xmath1 .",
    "we assume that sd penguin amplitudes are dominated by @xmath24 quark contribution .",
    "when terms of order @xmath25 are included , the strangeness violating penguin amplitude @xmath19 acquires a small weak phase .",
    "thus , @xmath19 can be represented as a sum of two terms , the second one due to the @xmath17 correction : @xmath26 penguin amplitude @xmath27 has weak phase -@xmath28 .",
    "we used in our fits the value of @xmath29 consistent with the world average .",
    "the singlet penguin has the same phase as penguin @xmath30 : @xmath31 + finally , we accept relations between the tree and colour - suppressed amplitudes : @xmath32    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the last equation includes electroweak penguin @xmath36 .",
    "the ew penguin contribution @xmath37 was calculated ( see e.g. @xcite ) without @xmath25 corrections .",
    "this fact should not affect the fits much since @xmath38 @xcite and the small correction in @xmath12 is practically invisible in the fits ( the only changes we observed were in the asymmetry for the @xmath39 decay channel ) .",
    "it was argued [ 7 - 13 ] that the intermediate states composed of charmed mesons ( @xmath40 , etc . ) , generated from the @xmath41 tree amplitudes @xmath42 , may lead via rescattering to amplitudes of penguin topology with an internal @xmath7 quark ( the `` charming penguin '' ) .",
    "our calculations are similar as in the case of long - distance @xmath4-type penguins @xcite . assuming su(3 ) symmetry",
    ", we can redefine penguins : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is related to the size of the ld charming penguin and is a complex number in general . because we do not have information about @xmath44 ( or @xmath42 ) , it is convenient to introduce the following parametrisation : @xmath45 strong phase @xmath46 and size @xmath47 of the charming penguin are additional free parameters in our fits .",
    "the weak phases are determined by the tree amplitudes @xmath48 and are either @xmath49 or 0 .",
    "we can eliminate @xmath50 using the relation @xmath51 + short - distance charming penguin @xmath52 has the same weak phase as @xmath53 .",
    "it can be included in a new redefined charming penguin @xmath54 with new effective size and strong phase .",
    "we minimise function f defined as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 denote theoretical ( experimental ) cp - averaged branching fractions and @xmath57 is an experimental error for i - th decay channel .",
    "the sum is over all 16 decay channels as in @xcite .",
    "experimental branching ratios and their errors are listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the connection between the amplitudes and branching ratios was corrected in our calculations for the lifetime difference between @xmath58 and @xmath59 :    @xmath60     + we considered two sets of data .",
    "the first one was the same as in @xcite .",
    "the second one was used in @xcite .",
    "data in table 2 are more recent and differ from the previous ones in a couple of entries .",
    "we performed fits in three general cases :    1 .   without long - distance charming penguin contributions and with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath1 treated as free parameters 2 .   with long - distance charming penguins described by real @xmath64 as an additional parameter and @xmath65 , which is consistent with calculations done in @xcite but without any assumed connection between @xmath66 and @xmath67 3 .   with long - distance charming penguins described by two additional free parameters : @xmath68 , @xmath64 .",
    ".fits to the first set of data ( in units of @xmath69 ) [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     charming penguins with a nonvanishing strong phase may be a source of direct cp asymmetries .",
    "the predicted values were calculated for the same points as in tables 1,2 .",
    "the results are given in table 3 together with the averages from belle , babar and cleo experiments @xcite .",
    "the main features are large asymmetries in the @xmath70 sector with relatively small asymmetries for the @xmath71 decays channels .",
    "we are not able to predict the absolute signs of the asymmetries since we have two allowed signs of @xmath68 .",
    "the asymmetry for @xmath72 is a pure @xmath25 effect and shows a potential influence of this correction .",
    "our results permit to draw the following conclusions :    1 .   even without the charming penguins the value of angle @xmath1 extracted from the fit depends on the details of data .",
    "more recent data prefer the value of @xmath1 more in accordance with the expectations of the standard model .",
    "2 .   if we admit the non - zero value of the charming penguin ( with strong phase equal zero ) , the fitted values of @xmath1 may move toward the sm value by @xmath73 .",
    "admitting strong phase of the charming penguin as a free parameter leads to a relatively flat function @xmath74 i.e. it allows a wide range of @xmath1 .",
    "this means that there is probably too much freedom in the fits .",
    "however , the fitted strong phase @xmath68 is relatively stable and close to @xmath2 .",
