    "excitable media exhibit a large response to a sufficiently strong disturbance from their only stable stationary homogeneous state .",

    "thus _ dc _ voltage bias conditions lead to pulse recycling ( at contacts ) and motion that give rise to self - sustained oscillations of the electric current , the so - called gunn effect , @xcite . while most of the theoretical and experimental studies of these phenomena deal with one dimensional geometries of samples with attached planar contacts , recent experiments @xcite and numerical studies @xcite have considered rectangular samples with point contacts . in this case , many unusual oscillatory patterns are found @xcite .",
    "a large part of the literature on pulse propagation is devoted to the mathematical description of their motion on one - dimensional unbounded domains . in the case of self - oscillations in semiconductor systems ,",
    "such a description is the basis of asymptotic analyses of pulse recycling and motion , both in one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xcite or axisymmetric two - dimensional ( 2d ) samples @xcite .",
    "these studies exploit that the electric field has only one relevant component whose integral yields the voltage difference between contacts .",
    "the situation is very different in more general geometries and new ideas need to be brought in . in this paper , we reduce pulse propagation ( far from contacts ) to the motion of a free boundary ( fb ) separating regions where the electric potential is a harmonic function .",

    "its solution describes very well the motion of a discontinuity of the electric potential representing the pulse far from the boundaries , as comparison with the numerical solution of the full system of differential equations shows .",
    "this is also true of the general 2d case , but now the solution of the fbp has to be obtained numerically . in all cases , recycling and annihilation of pulses at contacts",

    "in particular , we have used the godunov scheme @xmath187 this choice ensures that the information is always taken from where the solution is already known .",
    "the fast marching method is consistent with the huygens principle even when two waves collide and adopt an eight - shaped curve as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , or with even more complex topologies .",
    "the epp is solved by using an integral equation method based upon green s formula .",
    "this yields the solution @xmath1 within a region for a given value of its normal derivative at each point of the boundary . to make sure that the nonlinear boundary conditions at the fb hold",

    "two waves have been nucleated at the cathodes and have reached their typical circular form .",
    "the fb consists of two circumferences that divide the sample in three regions , @xmath188 , @xmath189 and @xmath190 , in which we should simultaneously solve the epp . implementing the fast marching method",
    ", we see two waves growing from the initial circumferences until a time @xmath165 , when they meet at the center of the sample .",
    "then the fb is a connected curve and we have the situation depicted in fig .",

    "the algorithm detects the time @xmath165 , adapts itself immediately to the new configuration similar to fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and it continues solving the fbp .            the accuracy and convergence of the method have been successfully checked by decreasing the mesh size .",
    "the computational cost of the method is very low compared to the computational and memory effort required by the resolution of the full kroemer model .",
    "the order - one fast marching method solves the eikonal equation in the whole sample with @xmath192 operations , where @xmath193 is the size of the mesh , but we only need to solve the eikonal equation in a narrow band ahead of the fb at each time step . on the other hand ,",
    "the epp solver carries out @xmath194 operations , where @xmath195 is the number of points defining the fb ( at most of order @xmath193 ) .",
    "we have studied gunn oscillations in 2d rectangular samples of n - gaas with circular contacts by solving the kroemer drift - diffusion model with appropriate boundary and initial conditions . by using singular perturbation methods ,",
    "the motion of dipole waves in semiconductor samples has been reduced to solving a free boundary problem .",
    "exact solutions of this problem have been found in simple 1d and axisymmetrical ( corbino ) geometries . in the general case ,",
    "the free boundary is numerically found by means of the fast marching method which is a special case of the method of level sets .",
    "the great reduction in computational cost allowed by using this method as an alternative to solving the full kroemer model would enable us to study much larger samples .",
