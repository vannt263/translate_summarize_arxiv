    "we select rgb stars from our cmds and use those to trace the stellar surface density along the minor axis .",
    "rgb stars are ideal as they are abundant in our cmds , are indicative of old stellar populations ( as expected to be found in the outskirts of galaxies ) , and are representative of the underlying stellar mass . to map the surface brightness profiles in the central regions of the galaxies we use the integrated light from spitzer / irac 4.5 micron observations .",
    "the spitzer images provide near unobscured light profiles , even for our edge - on galaxies .",
    "we scale the rgb surface density star counts such that they match the ir luminosity profiles in the overlapping region . in this way",
    "we derive equivalent surface brightness profiles directly from the rgb star counts .    in fig.[profs",
    "] we show profiles of the edge - on galaxies analyzed so far , along with outer profiles for the more face - on galaxies ngc3031/m81 and ngc5236/m83 .",
    "the exponential thin disks only dominate the inner @xmath323 kpc ( 5 - 10 scale heights ) , while the extended components are evident at larger radii .",
    "we find that eight of the nine galaxies analyzed thus far show components that are more extended than the exponential disks detected at small radii .",
    "several of the most massive galaxies have very extended envelopes with stellar densities at 30 kpc that are 10100 times higher than the contamination background , equivalent to @xmath329 @xmath6-mag arcsec@xmath7 .",
    "ngc5236/m83 is the only galaxy with a pure exponential disk to the last measured point at 20 kpc ( more than 10 disk scale lengths ) .      in this section",
    "we explore the connection between bulges and the extended components .",
    "we model the minor axis profiles by combining a srsic profile and an exponential disk .",
    "merger models show that the hot components resulting after a violent relaxation generally exhibit a srsic profile ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and reference therein ) .",
    "if bulges and stellar envelopes are created by a collisionless merger processes , we thus expect their light to follow a srsic profile .    for a number of massive galaxies ( @xmath0@xmath1200 kms@xmath8 ) we can fit the entire minor axis profile over a factor of 1000 in size ( @xmath310@xmath9 in surface density ) by an exponential disk and a single srsic profile , representing both the inner bulge - like region and the outer envelope .",
    "this is , for instance , the case for the bulge dominated ngc7814 or a galaxy like ngc3031/m81 , which has a power law outer envelope of rather steep slope .",
    "other galaxies , like ngc4565 , have too shallow an outer slope compared to their concentrated bulge region to be fitted by a srsic profile .",
    "ngc891 can be fitted by an exponential disk and a srsic profile from central bulge to outer envelope if we ignore our outermost field and presume that the higher star density at 30 kpc is due to substructure .",
    "finally ngc5236/m83 , which has only a small bulge , shows no sign of an outer envelope out to ten disk scale lengths .",
    "the smallest galaxies in the sample ( @xmath0@xmath10100120 kms@xmath8 ) have small extended components , barely discernible above the background contamination ( see fig.[profs ] ) .",
    "the shape of the extended component is thus poorly constrained due to both the uncertainty in the background and low number statistics .",
    "the star counts can be fitted equally well by exponential , power law , and srsic law profiles .",
    "this feature could be the thick disk , as observations of the ngc4244 major axis suggest the component is very flattened .",
    "however , the rgb main disk scale height is already twice that of the main sequence population and has been argued already represent the thick disk @xcite with the feature observed here being an additional component .",
    "these additional components are most likely ( depending on exact shape ) more luminous than predicted in the hierarchical models of @xcite , but could have been created by the bombardment of small dark matter sub - halos @xcite .",
    "therefore , a number of the observed extended envelopes seem structurally directly related to the central bulge regions , like in ngc7814 . in other galaxies , where the bulge is too concentrated",
    "to be simply related to the outer envelope , we can suspect that secular evolution ( e.g. , bar driven central enhancement and thickening ) can account for the extra ( pseudo-)bulge light .",
    "ngc4565 with its boxy bulge could nicely fall in this category . in small galaxies",
    "the extended envelope is unrelated to the central region , as these small galaxies have no bulge .      comparing the envelopes of the different galaxies we find that the two small galaxies have much smaller extended components than the larger galaxies , with surface densities that are lower relative to their disks .",
    "the more massive galaxies in our sample are very similar in terms of mass , luminosity , and scale size .",
    "still , there is significant variation in outer envelope properties . at 20 kpc ngc891 ,",
    "ngc4565 , and ngc7814 have power law profiles with a slope of about -2.5 .",
    "ngc3031/m81 has a steeper profile , while at 20 kpc ngc5236 is still dominated by the ( face - on ) disk . at first sight , the envelope luminosity at 20 kpc seems correlated with hubble type and bulge - to - disk ratio , with the bulge dominated ngc7814 being the brightest and the late - type spiral ngc5236 showing no sign of an envelope at all . although m31 also fits this trend , the sab galaxy ngc3031/m81 does not , as a steeper and fainter profile is evident at 20 kpc .    in fig.[profs ]",
    "we also show a typical profile from the @xcite model of accreted stars .",
    "our profiles are a bit shallower and mostly fainter than these models between 10 and 30 kpc .",
    "while the surface density normalization may be somewhat uncertain in the models , the shape is quite well constrained .",
    "it could be that the true halos only dominate at even larger radii and the slope becomes even shallower at larger radii .",
    "however , in hierarchical galaxy formation the halo and `` classical '' bulge are formed by the same merging process , so there is no reason to suspect a large structural change between bulge and halo .",
    "the srsic radii derived for our combined envelope and bulge fits are typically eight times smaller than those of @xcite . however , a number of simulation parameters affect the concentration of the accreted halos .",
    "increasing star formation suppression in small sub - halos , such that only the most massive dark matter sub - halos contain stars , yields steeper and fainter envelopes @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the stars in the accreted satellites could sit deeper in the potential wells of their dark matter sub - halos than simulated in these models , thereby only being tidally stripped closer to the main galaxy , also resulting in more concentrated halos @xcite .",
    "we use delaunay tessellations to reconstruct the surface density distributions in our fields ( sick & de jong , in prep . ) .",
    "ngc4631 has an obvious overdensity associated with the neighboring galaxy ngc4627 just to the north , but there is also a clear overdensity to the northwest .",
    "this overdensity , that is seen in main sequence , agb , and rgb stars , is potentially associated with an  stream in this strongly interacting system . in stark contrast to these clear signs of substructure",
    ", we find no signs of any substructure surrounding the disk of ngc4565 .",
    "when comparing these density reconstructions with the substructure observed around m31 on the same physical scale , the ngc4565 halo appears to be much smoother .",
    "we are currently developing techniques to quantify halo substructure .",
    "support for proposal numbers 9765 , 10523 , and 10889 was provided by nasa through a grant from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 ."
