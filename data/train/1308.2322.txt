    "the long - range coherence of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) offers the possibility to study the collective motion induced by external radiation beams @xcite . in specific",
    ", it has been observed that the coherent center - of - mass motion of atoms in a condensate driven by a highly detuned laser gives rise to the superradiant rayleigh scattering and matter - wave amplification @xcite .",
    "the matter - wave grating produced in these experiments is due to the coherent superposition of atomic momentum states which is identical to the one formed in bragg scattering experiments in which the condensate atoms are diffracted by a standing wave of light @xcite .",
    "the collective atomic recoil lasing ( carl ) @xcite process shows the collective instability which causes the spontaneous formation of a regular density grating in a bec which was first demonstrated in superradiant rayleigh scattering experiments @xcite and matter - wave amplification @xcite .",
    "the coherence in the atomic momentum states plays an important role in all these experiments .",
    "the carl process can be supressed by the effects such as spontaneous emission , inhomogeneous broadening , and collisions in the atomic sample which may ruin the coherences in the matter waves @xcite .",
    "the atoms scatter a single laser photon and recoil with a momentum of @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the wave - vector of the incident photon ) in the direction of the incident laser photon in the absence of doppler broadening due to thermal motion of bec atoms .",
    "the carl instability is responsible for the exponentially enhancement in the scattered photon number and the amplitude of the density grating which arises due to the interference between the atomic wavepackets with momentum difference @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the quantum mechanical illustration of the center - of - mass motion of the condensate atoms is extended theoretically from the semiclassical model of carl @xcite .",
    "experimentally and theoretically , the affect of motion of atoms on the superradiant scattering of light from a moving bec was observed in @xcite .",
    "the enhancement in the superradiant scattering process in the cavity of light field is possible due to the multiple reflections of the pump laser from the mirrors of the cavity which amplifies the coupling time of the atoms with the optical fields @xcite .",
    "the effects of a movable mirror of an optical cavity on the superradiant light scattering from a bec in an optical lattice has been investigated @xcite .",
    "optomechanical cooling of a system to its quantum ground state is the main goal of the recent field of optomechanics . in the recent years",
    ", there has been an outpouring interest in the application of radiation forces to modify the centre - of - mass motion of mechanical resonators involving a vast range from macroscopic mirrors in the laser interferometer gravitational observatory ( ligo ) project @xcite to nano- or micromechanical cantilevers @xcite , vibrating microtoroids @xcite , membranes @xcite and ultracold atoms @xcite . cooling of the motion of mechanical oscillators is possible with positive radiation pressure damping whereas parametric amplification of small forces is observed with negative damping @xcite . in the fascinating work of braginsky @xcite , the mechanical damping due to radiation was first detected in the decay of an excited oscillator .",
    "recently , the cooling of the center - of - mass motion of the mechanical oscillator i.e. , both the measurement and mechanical damping of the random thermal brownian motion , was attained by using many techniques .",
    "these involve active feedback cooling @xcite based on position measurements , intrinsic optomechanical cooling by radiation pressure @xcite or photothermal forces @xcite . a system composed of atoms in an optical cavity with moving end mirror",
    "was studied @xcite .",
    "it was found that the motion of the mirror alters the dipole potential in which atoms move and the position becomes bistable .",
    "forty years ago , it was suggested @xcite that the relativistic motion of the mirror could create real photons from virtual photons .",
    "this phenomenon was later termed as the dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) @xcite .",
    "this dce has a common feature of creating quanta from vacuum due to the motion of macroscopic neutral boundaries or time - modulation of material properties of some macroscopic system .",
    "this fascinating phenomenon has attracted the attention of many theoreticians since decades @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that the dce originates so far mostly due to the oscillation of a cavity boundary , motion of mirror in vacuum or modulation of dielectric properties of the medium inside the cavity which causes the generation of photon pairs from the electromagnetic vacuum .",
    "recent experiments have observed the dce which makes the problem of detecting photons generated from initial vacuum state to be realistic @xcite . in view of recent progress ,",
    "the so - called dce has been observed with harmonic modulation of the cavity frequency in the presence of harmonic oscillators @xcite and multi - level atoms @xcite .",
    "given the promising developments in the field of ultracold atoms , cavity optomechanics and dce , we propose a scheme to couple bec to an optomechanical cavity to study the dce .",
    "the optomechanical cavity has one cavity mirror fixed while the other mirror moving .",
    "this system is studied by considering firstly the classical motion of the movable mirror and then the quantized mirror motion .",
    "the cavity field is harmonically time - modulated in both the cases , thereby , making the system non - stationary .",
    "the main quantity of interest in the phenomenon of dce is the number of photons produced inside the cavity which is studied here .",
    "the system investigated here consists of noninteracting bosonic two - level atoms inside an optomechanical cavity coupled to two radiation fields via the electric - dipole interaction as shown in figure [ a ] .",
    "specifically , we take an elongated cigar shaped bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) consisting of n two - level atoms with mass @xmath2 and frequency @xmath3 having transition @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "when the frequency of the harmonic trap along the axial direction is smaller than the frequency along the transverse direction then an elongated cigar shaped bec is formed .",
    "the bosonic atoms are confined in optomechanical cavity whose one end mirror is fixed and other end mirror is movable . however , the mirror motion is considered to be classical .",
    "furthermore , the cavity frequency is sinusoidally time - modulated i.e. @xmath7 .",
    "here , @xmath8 is the unperturbed cavity frequency , @xmath9 is the modulation amplitude and @xmath10 is the modulation frequency .",
    "we consider an external pump laser with frequency @xmath11 and amplitude @xmath12 incident on one side mirror of the optical cavity .",
    "when the longitudnal mode spacing is assumed to be larger than the induced resonance frequency shift of the cavity then one can take single longitudnal cavity mode .",
    "this approximation is considered here .",
    "the population of the atoms in the excited state is assumed to be negligible as the detuning of the pump laser and the atomic frequency is approximated to be too large as compared to the detuning of pump laser with cavity mode .",
    "therefore , the spontaneous emission and two body dipole - dipole interactions can be safely ignored .",
    "but the two photon transitions are allowed which do not alters the atomic internal states .",
    "however , the center - of - mass motion of atom changes due to the recoil .",
    "an atom absorbs a photon from one mode and release a photon in counter - propagating mode .",
    "therefore , it experiences a recoil kick equal to the difference between the momenta of two photons ( of the order of two optical momenta ) .",
    "the distinct momentum states of the atomic center - of mass motion interact with two photon transition .",
    "hence , the time - dependent hamiltonian of the system in the dipole approximation is given as @xcite    @xmath13    the free energy of photons inside the time - dependent cavity is given as    @xmath14    where @xmath15 being the annhilation ( creation ) operator which obeys the commutation relation @xmath16=1 $ ] .",
    "the free energy of atoms is given by    @xmath17    where @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the ground and excited field operators of the atoms respectively .",
    "the third term in @xmath20 represents the atom - photon coupling which is given as    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the coupling constant . here",
    ", the counter - propagating optical cavity field interacts with the condensate field .",
    "this counter - propagating optical cavity modes are directed towards @xmath23 axis .",
    "also , here @xmath1 represents the wavenumber of the cavity light mode . here",
    ", the atom field operators obey the commutation relation as    @xmath24=\\delta _ { j , j'}\\delta ( z , z'),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath25=\\left[\\psi _ { j}^{\\dagger}(z),\\psi_{j'}^{\\dagger}(z')\\right]=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 . now",
    ", the energy due to external laser pump is given by the fourth term of @xmath20 i.e. ,    @xmath28    here @xmath12 is the amplitude of the external laser beam .",
    "the fifth term ( @xmath29 ) in the hamiltonian ( @xmath20 ) is the squeezing term @xcite given as    @xmath30    due to degenerate parametric amplification of the field , this term helps in producing squeezed states of the field @xcite .",
    "the photons are produced in the cavity from the vacuum state due to the fast motion of the cavity boundaries .",
    "this effect is known as dynamical casimir effect ( dce ) @xcite.the effect of dce can possibly produce squeezed states @xcite .",
    "also @xmath31 is related to @xmath32 as @xcite    @xmath33    now we take the realistic case of small - amplitude time modulation i.e. @xmath34 .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath35    where ,    @xmath36    now , using the heisenberg equation of motion @xmath37\\right)$ ] , one can adiabatically eliminate the excited state of atoms as the pump - atom detuning @xmath38 is very large .",
    "this gives the heisenberg equations of motion for the ground state field operator @xmath39 and the cavity field annhilation operator @xmath40 by taking into account all the dissipative processes :    @xmath41    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the cavity photon decay rate .",
    "the proposed system is basically open as the photons leak from the cavity so the cavity field is damped .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of the equality in equation ( [ 5a ] ) represents the self consistent optical grating whose amplitude depends on time according to equation ( [ 5b ] ) .",
    "also , the fourth term on the right side of the equality in equation ( [ 5b ] ) gives the self consistent matter wave grating .",
    "the spatial periodic boundary conditions can be asuumed if the density of the condensate atoms is homogeneous and the optical radiation wavelength is much shorter than the length of the condensate .",
    "this leads to the ground state wavefunction of the condensate atoms as    @xmath46    here , @xmath47 represents the momentum eigenfunctions with eigenvalues @xmath48 .",
    "the atomic motion considered here is based on an equivalent assumption that the atoms in a bec are not localized inside the length of the condensate and the uncertainity in the corresponding momentum state is negligibly small .",
    "now , the equations ( [ 5a ] ) and ( [ 5b ] ) can be reduced to the following set of ordinary differential equations    @xmath49",
    "@xmath50    @xmath51    here , @xmath52 , @xmath53 is the initial momentum level , @xmath54 is the final momentum level and @xmath55 is the recoil frequency .",
    "also , here @xmath56 is the rescaled photon operator with @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the rescaled external pump amplitude with @xmath59 .",
    "defining coherence @xmath60 and the population difference between the two states as @xmath61 , we obtain the following equations of motion    @xmath62    @xmath63    @xmath64    here , we have introduced a damping term in equation ( [ 8a ] ) to account for the decay of the coherence between the two motional states @xmath53 and @xmath54 . now separating the above equations of motion into real and imaginary parts , we get    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67    @xmath68    @xmath69    where , the renormalized coupling constant is given as @xmath70 .",
    "we investigate the system in the quantum superradiant regime @xmath71 . in this regime ,",
    "the condensate momentum alters by @xmath0 as each atom scatters a single photon only .",
    "as soon as the pump power builds up in the ring cavity , the collective dynamics start .",
    "we solve the above coupled differential equations of motion ( [ 9a]-[9e ] ) using mathematica 9.0 to study this dynamics via the evolution of the power @xmath72 .",
    "we further identify two more interesting regimes under which the system is investigated .",
    "first is strong modulation @xmath73 and other is weak modulation @xmath74 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     now again separating the above set of differential equations into real and imaginary parts , we obtain the following equations    @xmath75    @xmath76    @xmath77    @xmath78    @xmath79    @xmath80    @xmath81    now we renormalize @xmath82 and @xmath83 and solve the above coupled differential equations of motion using mathematica 9.0 . again",
    "we investigate the system under the same quantum superradiant regime .",
    "also , the system is studied under the same limits as in previous section .",
    "apart from the observations noticed in previous section , here we note some additional features as described below .    figures ( [ c ] ( a ) ) and ( [ c](b ) ) show the time signal of the scattered light power @xmath84 and figures ( [ c](c ) ) and ( [ c](d ) ) show the corresponding position dynamics of the movable mirror @xmath85 versus scaled time @xmath86 using time modulated cavity frequency at resonant modulating frequency @xmath87 for two modulation amplitudes @xmath88 ( thin line ) and @xmath89 ( thick line ) .",
    "the plots demonstrate an initial rise in the amplitude of scattered light ( see figs .",
    "( [ c](a ) ) and ( [ c](b ) ) ) while an initial dip in the position dynamics of the mirror ( see figs .",
    "( [ c](c ) ) and ( [ c](d ) ) ) . as time passes ,",
    "the oscillations of the scattered light is damped whereas the corresponding oscillations of the position dynamics of the movable mirror is enhanced .",
    "this clearly shows the exchange of energy between different degrees of freedom of the system . also , as observed with the classical motion of the mirror , here initially the amplitude of the number of scattered photons is more for lower modulation amplitude as compared to higher modulation amplitude and the amplitude of the corresponding mirror displacement is less for lower modulation amplitude as compared to higher modulation amplitude . as compared to the case of classical mirror motion",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ b ] ) , here the amplitude of the number of scattered photons is less .",
    "this is because here there is an additional degree of freedom ( movable mirror ) .",
    "so here the exchange of energy takes place with an extra degree of freedom which decreases the scattered photons in the cavity .",
    "also , in the present case , there is not much difference in the plots of number of scattered photons under the strong and weak modulation in contrast to the case of classical motion of the mirror .",
    "this means that the effect of modulating the cavity frequency doesnot alter much the number of scattered photons in the cavity by considering the quantized mirror motion .",
    "plot ( [ d ] ) shows the influence of cavity detuning on the time signal of the scattered light power @xmath90 and the corresponding position dynamics of the movable mirror at resonant modulating frequency @xmath87 for two modulation amplitudes @xmath88 ( thin line ) and @xmath89 ( thick line ) with @xmath91 .",
    "plots ( [ d](a ) ) and ( [ d](b ) ) illustrate amplification in the scattered light .",
    "this is due to the dce which produces many photons inside the cavity from the vacuum state , leading to enhancement in the number of scattered photons in the cavity .",
    "plots ( [ d](c ) ) and ( [ d](d ) ) show the corresponding suppression in the position dynamics of the movable mirror .",
    "this variation is again due to the balance of energy between different degrees of freedom .",
    "plot ( [ e ] ) illustates the same influence of cavity detuning as in figure ( [ d ] ) with @xmath92 .",
    "not much amplification is observed in the scattered light power . in both the figures ( [ d ] ) and ( [ e ] )",
    ", we observe that at a particular @xmath93 , the plots for the scattered number of photons and corresponding mirror displacement are similar i.e. they are not effected by the strong or weak modulation . also , the amplitude of the scattered number of photons inside the cavity is high for @xmath91 than for @xmath92 .",
    "now , we will describe the experimentally realizable parameters used in our calculations .",
    "a bec consisting of @xmath94 @xmath95 atoms @xcite coupled to an optical field of an ultra high finesse fabry perot cavity has the strength of the coherent coupling as @xmath96 mhz @xcite , ( @xmath97 @xcite ) .",
    "the kinetic and potential energy of the atoms is about @xmath98 khz @xcite ( @xmath99 khz @xcite ) .",
    "also the coherent amplification or the damping of atomic motion is ignored as the condensate temperature @xmath100 .",
    "the detuning of the atom pump is @xmath101 ghz .",
    "the atom field interaction is decreased due to decrease in the energy of the cavity mode because of the loss of photons through the cavity mirrors . by using high quality factor cavities , such loss of photons",
    "can be minimized .",
    "the cavity field can have damping rate @xmath102 khz @xcite ( @xmath103 mhz @xcite ) .",
    "the mechanical frequency of themovable mirror in an ptomechanical system can be altered from @xmath104 hz @xcite , @xmath105 khz @xcite , to @xmath106 mhz @xcite .",
    "the corresponding decay rate of the movable mirror can thus be varied from @xmath107 hz @xcite , @xmath108 hz @xcite , to @xmath109 khz @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed how the superradiant light scattering from an elongated bose - einstein condensate in an optomechanical cavity in the quantum regime is altered in the presence of the dynamical casimir effect by considering the classical and quantized motion of the movable mirror .",
    "the cavity frequency is sinusoidally modulated with time in both mirror motions .",
    "the scattered light spectrum shows bragg oscillations , modified by the dynamical casimir effect , superimposed on the usual superradiant spectrum .",
    "the mirror motion has a dispersive effect leading to higher amplitude of scattered photon for lower modulation amplitude at initial times .",
    "also , the amplitude of scattered photon number is much higher for classical mirror motion than the quantized mirror motion . the quantized motion of the movable mirror leads to similar behaviour of the spectrum of scattered light for both weak and strong modulations .",
    "the dynamical casimir effect is found to be a new handle to coherently control and manipulate the superradiant light scattering process .",

    "in this appendix , we derive the time - dependent hamiltoninan for the system by considering the quantized motion of the movable mirror .",
    "as one knows that , the cavity frequency is given as @xcite                  where @xmath116 , @xmath117 is the quantized perturbation in cavity length , @xmath118 is the annhilation operator of movable mirror , @xmath119 is the dimensionless position operator of the movable mirror , @xmath120 is the modulation amplitude and @xmath10 is the modulation frequency . using the time - modulated perturbation of cavity length in equation [ one ] , we get          the effective frequency also changes in this case as it is dependent on time varying cavity frequency ( see eqn [ 4a ] ) .",
    "therefore , modified effective frequency for the system with the quantized mirror motion becomes                              in the above hamiltonian , the free energy of the movable mirror is represented by @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the frequency . now substituting the time varying cavity frequency ( eqn .",
    "[ two ] ) , time varying effective frequency ( eqn .",
    "[ three ] ) and time varying coupling parameter ( eqn . [ four ] ) in the above hamiltonian ( eqn .

    "<S> we investigate the effects of dynamical casimir effect in superradiant light scattering by bose - einstein condensate in an optomechanical cavity . </S>",

    "<S> the cavity frequency is harmonically modulated in time for both the cases . </S>",
    "<S> the main quantity of interest is the number of intracavity scattered photons . </S>",
    "<S> the system has been investigated under the weak and strong modulation . </S>",
    "<S> it has been observed that the amplitude of the scattered photons is more for the classical mirror motion than the quantized mirror motion . </S>",
    "<S> also , initially , the amplitude of scattered photons is high for lower modulation amplitude than higher modulation amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the behaviour of the plots are similar under strong and weak modulation for the quantized mirror motion . </S>"
