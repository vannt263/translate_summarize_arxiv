    "@xmath21 is a spectral set if and only if @xmath17 is a translational tile .",
    "_ this conjecture baffled experts for 30 years until 2004 , tao @xcite gave the first counterexamples on @xmath12 , @xmath22 .",
    "the examples were modified later so that the conjecture are false in both directions on @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it remains open in dimension 1 and 2 . despite the counterexamples ,",
    "the exact relationship between spectral measures and tiling is still mysterious .",
    "the problem of spectral measures is as exciting when we consider fractal measures .",
    "jorgensen and pedersen @xcite showed that the standard cantor measures are spectral measures if the contraction is @xmath25 , while there are at most two orthogonal exponentials when the contraction is @xmath26 . following this discovery ,",
    "more spectral self - similar / self - affine measures were also found ( @xcite , @xcite et .",
    "the construction of these spectral self - similar measures is based on the existence of the _ compatible pairs ( known also as hadamard triples)_. it is still unknown whether all such spectral measures are obtained from compatible pairs .",
    "having an exponential basis , the series convergence problem was also studied by strichartz .",
    "it is surprising that the ordinary fourier series of continuous functions converge uniformly for standard cantor measures @xcite . by",
    "now there are considerable amount of literatures studying spectral measures and other generalized types of fourier expansions like the fourier frames and riesz bases ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein ) .    in @xcite , hu and lau made a start in studying the spectral properties of bernoulli convolutions , the simplest class of self - similar measures .",
    "they classified the contraction ratios with infinitely many orthogonal exponentials .",
    "it was recently shown by dai that the only spectral bernoulli convolutions are of contraction ratio @xmath25 @xcite . in this paper , we study another general class of cantor measures on @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 be an integer and @xmath3 be another positive integer .",

    "@xmath30 satisfying @xmath31 for all borel sets @xmath32 .",
    "note that we only need to consider equal weight since non - equally weighted self - similar measures here can not have any spectrum by theorem 1.5 in @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that if @xmath33 , @xmath11 becomes the standard cantor measure of @xmath34 contraction . for this class of self - similar measures ,",
    "we find surprisingly that the spectral properties depend heavily on the number theoretic relationship between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "our first result is to show that _ @xmath30 has infinitely many orthogonal exponentials if and only if @xmath6 and @xmath7 is not relatively prime .",
    "if moreover , @xmath6 divides @xmath7 , the resulting measure will be a spectral measure _ ( theorem [ th1.1 ] ) .",
    "however , when @xmath6 does not divide @xmath7 and they are not relatively prime ( e.g. @xmath35 ) , variety of cases may occur and we are not sure whether there are spectral measures in these classes ( see remark [ rem2.1 ] ) .",
    "we then focus on the case when @xmath36 in which we aim at giving a detailed classification of its spectra .",
    "the classification of spectra , for a given spectral measure , was first studied by lagarias , reeds and wang @xcite .",
    "they considered the spectra of @xmath37 ( more generally fundamental domains of some lattices ) and they showed that the spectra of @xmath37 are exactly all the tiling sets of @xmath38 . if @xmath39 , the way of tiling @xmath40 is rather rigid , and it is easy to see that the only spectrum ( respectively the tiling set ) is the translates of the integer lattice @xmath41 .",
    "such kind of rigidity breaks down even on @xmath27 if we turn to fractal measures .",
    "the first attempt of the classification of its spectra was due to @xcite , dutkay , han and sun decomposed the maximal orthogonal sets of one - fourth cantor measure using @xmath42-adic expansion with digits @xmath43 and put them into a labeling of the binary tree .",
    "the maximal orthogonal sets will then be obtained by reading all the infinite paths with digits ending eventually in @xmath44 ( for positive elements ) or @xmath45 ( for negative elements ) .",
    "they also gave some sufficient conditions on the digits for a maximal orthogonal set to be a spectrum .",
    "nonetheless , the condition is not easy to verify .    turning to our self - similar measures with consecutive digits where the one - fourth cantor measure is a special case",
    ", we will classify all the maximal orthogonal sets using mappings on the standard @xmath9adic tree called _ maximal mappings _ ( theorem [ th1.6 ] ) .",
    "this construction improves the tree labeling method in @xcite in two ways .    1 .",
    "we will choose the digit system to be @xmath46 instead of @xmath47 @xmath48 . by doing so",
    ", all integers ( both positive and negative ) can be expanded into @xmath10adic expansions terminating at @xmath44 ( lemma [ lem1.1 ] ) .",
    "we impose restrictions on our labeling position on the tree so that together with ( 1 ) , all the elements in a maximal orthogonal set can be extracted by reading some specific paths in the tree .",
    "these paths are collected in a countable set @xmath49 defined in ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "having such a new tree structure of a maximal orthogonal set , we discover there are two possibilities for the maximal sets depending on whether all the paths in @xmath49 are corresponding to some elements in the maximal orthogonal sets ( i.e. the values assigned are eventually 0 ) .",
    "if it happens that all the paths in @xmath49 behave nicely as said , we call such maximal orthogonal sets _ regular_.",
    "it turns out that regular sets cover most of the interesting cases and we can give regular sets a natural ordering @xmath50 .",
    "if the standard @xmath9adic expansion of @xmath51 has length @xmath52 , we define @xmath53 to be the number of non - zero digits in the @xmath10adic expansion using @xmath54 of @xmath55 after @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 is our crucial factor in determining whether the set is a spectrum .",
    "we show that _ if @xmath53 grows slowly enough or even uniformly bounded , the set will be a spectrum , while if @xmath53 grows too fast , say it is of polynomial rates , then the maximal orthogonal sets will not be a spectrum _ ( theorem [ th1.7 ] ) .",
    "in @xcite , dutkay _ et al _ tried to generalize the classical results of landau @xcite about the beurling density on fourier frames to fractal settings .",
    "they defined the concept of _ beurling dimensions _ for a discrete set and showed that all bessel sequences for an ifs of similitudes with no overlap condition must have beurling dimension not greater than its hausdorff dimension of the attractor . under technical assumption on the frame spectra",
    ", they showed the above two dimensions coincide .",
    "they conjectured that the assumption can be removed .",
    "however , as we see that @xmath53 counts the number of non - zero digits only , we can freely add @xmath56 for any @xmath57 on the tree of the canonical spectrum .",
    "these additional terms push the @xmath55 s as far away from each other as wanted and we therefore show that _ there exists spectrum of zero beurling dimension _ ( theorem [ th1.9 ] ) .    for the organization of the paper , we present our set - up and main results in section 2 . in section 3 , we discuss the maximal orthogonal sets of @xmath0 and classify all maximal orthogonal sets via the maximal mapping on the @xmath9adic when @xmath6 divides @xmath7 . in section 4 , we discuss the regular spectra and prove the growth rate criteria .",
