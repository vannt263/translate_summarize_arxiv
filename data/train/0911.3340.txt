    "recent evidences from supernova searches data [ 1,2 ] , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) results [ 3 - 5 ] and also wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data [ 6,7,8 ] , show an positively accelerating phase of the cosmic expansion today and this feature shows that the simple picture of the universe consisting of the pressureless fluid is not enough to describe the cosmological dynamics . in this regard ,",
    "the universe may contain some sort of the additional negative - pressure dark energy .",
    "analysis of the wmap data [ 9 - 11 ] shows that there is no indication for any significant deviations from gaussianity and adiabaticity of the cmb power spectrum and therefore suggests that the universe is spatially flat to within the limits of observational accuracy .",
    "further , the combined analysis of the wmap data with the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) [ 9 ] , constrains the equation of state @xmath1 , corresponding to almost @xmath2 contribution of dark energy in the currently accelerating universe , to be very close to that of the cosmological constant value . in this respect , a @xmath3cdm",
    "( cosmological constant plus cold dark matter ) model has maximum agreement with the recent data , but with an unnaturally small and fine - tuned value of @xmath3 [ 4 ] . from the general relativity viewpoint ,",
    "such models simply modify the right hand side of the einstein s field equations by including in the stress - energy tensor something more than the usual matter and radiation components . as a radically different approach",
    ", one can also try to leave the source side unchanged , but rather modifying the geometric sector in the left - hand side . in this viewpoint",
    ", the cosmic speed up can be interpreted as a first signal of the breakdown of the laws of physics as encoded by the standard general relativity .",
    "this is essentially reasonable : the general relativity has been experimentally tested only up to the solar system scale and there is no a priori theoretical motivation to extend its validity to extraordinarily larger scales such as the cosmological ones . extending general relativity without giving up its positive results ,",
    "opens the way to a large class of alternative theories of gravity ranging from extra - dimensions [ 12 ] to non - minimally coupled scalar fields [ 13,14,15 ] .",
    "in particular , fourth order theories [ 16,17,18 ] based on replacing the scalar curvature @xmath4 in the einstein - hilbert action with a generic analytic function @xmath5 have attracted a lot of attention in the last decade",
    ". also referred to as @xmath5 gravity , these models have been shown to be able to both fit the cosmological data and evade the solar system constraints in several physically interesting cases [ 19 - 28 ] . in this sense ,",
    "modified gravity provides the very natural gravitational alternative for dark energy .",
    "also modified gravity presents very natural unification of the early - time inflation and late - time acceleration due to different role of gravitational terms relevant at small and at large curvature [ 29,30,31 ] .",
    "moreover , some models of modified gravity are predicted by string / m - theory considerations [ 16,17,18 ] .    in the framework of braneworld scenarios , a possible approach to realize the late - time acceleration of the universe is to consider modification of gravity on the appropriate scales .",
    "this can be achieved for instance by a weakening of gravitational interaction at large scales .",
    "weakening of gravity on large scales provides an effective negative pressure that drives the late - time acceleration of the universe .",
    "the dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) scenario [ 32 ] is one of the simplest scenario in this regard . in this model ,",
    "our universe is a brane embedded in a minkowski 5d bulk space - time .",
    "standard matter and gauge interactions are trapped on the brane and only gravity experiences the full bulk .",
    "cosmological dynamics in this setup follows two distinct branches of solutions : self - accelerating and the normal branch [ 33,34,35 ] .",
    "late - time acceleration can be explained in the self - accelerating branch without invoking any unknown dark energy component .",
    "however , the normal branch requires a dark energy component to accommodate the current observations [ 36 - 45 ] .",
    "although the self - accelerating branch explains the late - time acceleration in a fascinating manner , it suffers from serious theoretical problems such as the ghost issue [ 46 ] .",
    "fortunately the normal branch is free from instabilities .",
    "recently it has been shown that the normal branch of the dgp braneworld scenario which is not self - accelerating can realize phantom - like behavior without introducing any phantom field on the brane [ 36 - 45 ] . by phantom - like behavior",
    "we mean an effective energy density which is positive and grows with time and its equation of state parameter stays always less than @xmath6 .",
    "other extensions to realize this phantom - like behavior are studied in refs .",
    "[ 47 - 66 ] .",
    "on the other hand , dark energy models with non - minimally coupled scalar field and other extensions of scalar - tensor theories have been studied widely some of which can be found in references [ 67 - 71 ] .    in the spirit of scalar - tensor dark energy models ,",
    "our motivation here is to show that a general @xmath7 gbig - inspired scenario can account for late - time acceleration and crossing of the phantom divide line in some suitable domains of model parameters space . to show this feature , first we study cosmological dynamics of @xmath8 gbig - inspired scenario briefly . in the minimal case , motivated by modified theories of gravity",
    ", some authors have included a term of the type @xmath9 in the action [ 72 - 77 ] .",
    "this extension for some values of @xmath10 has the capability to explain late - time acceleration of the universe in a simple manner .",
    "it is then natural to extend this scenario to more general embeddings of dgp inspired scenarios .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform such a generalization to study both late - time acceleration and possible crossing of the phantom divide line in this setup .",
    "we construct a braneworld scenario with modified induced gravity on the brane and the gauss - bonnet term in the bulk action .",
    "we study cosmological dynamics of this setup and we explore phantom - like behavior in the normal branch of the model .",
    "we focus mainly on the potential of the type @xmath11 for non - minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "our setup for minimal case predicts a power - law acceleration supporting observed late - time acceleration . in the non - minimal case , by a suitable choice of non - minimal coupling and scalar field potential , one obtains accelerated expansion in some specific regions of parameters space .",
    "while a single minimally coupled scalar field in four dimensions can not reproduce a crossing of the phantom divide line for any scalar field potential [ 47 - 66 ] , a non - minimally coupled scalar field account for such a crossing [ 78 ] . in gbig model , equation of state parameter of dark energy",
    "never crosses @xmath12 line , and universe eventually turns out to be de sitter phase .",
    "nevertheless , in this setup if we include a single scalar field ( ordinary or phantom ) on the brane , we can show that equation of state parameter of dark energy can cross the phantom divide line [ 79 ] .",
    "crossing of the phantom divide line with non - minimally coupled scalar field on the warped dgp brane has been studied recently [ 80 ] . here",
    "we present an extension of these non - minimal dark energy models within gbig - inspired @xmath7 braneworld scenario .",
    "we use a prime for differentiation with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "an overdot marks differentiation with respect to the brane time coordinate .",
    "we show that this model provides a natural candidate for explanation of several interesting aspects of the late - time acceleration without suffering from issues such as the ghost instability . among these features ,",
    "natural realization of the phantom divide line crossing is worth to noting .",
    "the gbig gravity is a generalized braneworld scenario which contains both uv ( ultra - violet ) and ir ( infra - red ) limits in a unified manner : it contains stringy effect via gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term in the bulk action as the uv sector of the theory and induced gravity ( ig ) effect which becomes important in the ir limit [ 81 - 89 ] .",

    "note that this phantom - like effects is realized without introducing any phantom matter on the brane and only screening of the brane cosmological constant due to non - minimal coupling and the curvature effect causes such an intriguing aspect .",
    "figure @xmath161 shows the variation of the effective dark energy density versus the redshift and the non - minimal coupling .",
    "we note that while the introduction of a phantom field requires the violation of the null energy condition , here this energy condition is respected ( at least in some subspaces of the model parameter space ) since we have not included any phantom matter on the brane . in other words , since the phantom - like dynamics realized in this setup is gravitational ( the quintessence field introduced on the brane plays the role of standard matter on the brane ) , the null energy condition could be respected in some subspaces of the model parameter space .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed in some detail a modified @xmath3dgp - gauss - bonnet model which corresponds to a 5d braneworld model where the bulk is a 5d minkowski space - time .",
    "this model contains a gauss - bonnet term in the bulk and an induced gravity term on the brane which is modified in the spirit of @xmath5 gravity .",
    "we incorporated also a canonical ( quintessence ) scalar field non - minimally coupled to induced gravity on the brane .",
    "our analysis is performed for the normal ( or non self - accelerating ) ghost - free branch which we have assumed to be filled by cold deark matter ( cdm ) and a cosmological constant .",
    "we have shown especially that how the brane accelerates at late - time in this normal branch .",
    "an interesting feature of this model is the role played by the extra dimension : it induces a mimicry of a phantom - like behavior without introducing any matter that violates the null energy condition on the brane .",
    "this phantom - like behavior happens without any super - acceleration of the brane .",
    "we should emphasize that the gauss - bonnet effect which induces the ultraviolet corrections on the brane , modifies the phantom - like behavior at earlier times .",
    "therefore , a consistent dgp brane model which essentially is an infra - red modification of the general relativity , should have ultraviolet modifications as well and this is achieved by incorporation of the gauss - bonnet term in the bulk action .",
    "we have incorporated also the possible modification of the induced gravity on the brane .",
    "this is equivalent to introduce a canonical scalar field on the brane with general relativity as the background gravitational theory . by adopting suitable and observationally viable ansatz for @xmath0 and the scale factor ,",
    "we have shown that this model realizes the phantom - like behavior in some subspaces of the model parameter space without violation of the null energy condition .",
    "the phantom - like prescription in our proposed model has no break down in some appropriate subspaces of the model parameter space and it realizes a smooth crossing of the phantom - divide line . + * acknowledgment * + this work has been supported partially by research institute for astronomy and astrophysics of maragha , iran .",
