    "there is much current interest in using si / ge strained layer superlattices and multiple quantum wells to fabricate optoelectronic and electronic devices  one example being better high frequency performance for heterojunction bipolar transistors . in order to design effective devices we need to know the carrier concentration @xmath2 and the conduction mobility @xmath3 , which are usually obtained using hall measurements .",
    "however , to extract @xmath2 and @xmath3 from the experimental results , we need to know the hall coefficient @xmath4  but experiments in si@xmath0ge@xmath1 @xcite have shown @xmath4 has values that can not be accounted for by existing attempts at modelling ( see e.g. @xcite ) . also , the hall factor @xmath4 allows an interesting test of the accuracy of the band parameters because it is quite sensitive to both the non - parabolicity and anisotropy of the bands .",
    "the reason that hall data from existing experiments @xcite is not well explained by existing models is most probably either because ( a ) these models used a linearly interpolated bandstructure , or ( b ) they omitted the important effects of ionised impurity scattering .",
    "alternatives to a linearly interpolated bandstructure have been given by rieger and vogl @xcite , using an empirical psuedopotential approach , and hayes suggests a similar method based on results of a parallelized car - parrinello scheme @xcite .",
    "some other papers discussing models and bandstructure parameters for sige alloys are @xcite .    here",
    "we attack the second of these shortcomings , by calculating the hall parameters using a comprehensive monte carlo simulation of hole motion in si@xmath0ge@xmath1 strained to a silicon substrate .",
    "these simulations are aided by the incorporation of a new optimised scheme for treating ionised impurity scattering@xcite .",
    "our results show that the inclusion of ionised impurity scattering sucessfully explains the experimental data , leaving the bandstructure interpolation as a secondary effect .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : section [ smc ] describes the monte carlo model used in the mobility and hall calculations ; section [ sresults ] compares the results of the simulations for linearly interpolated band parameters with experiments .",
    "finally in section [ sconclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "our monte carlo simulations@xcite of this system include a full @xmath5 band structure calculation @xcite and all important scattering processes : optical and accoustical deformation potential , alloy , and ( in particular ) ionised impurity scattering@xcite .",
    "we treat the effect of the electric and magnetic fields classically , giving the holes continuous trajectories in @xmath6-space  comparison with experiment for p - ge systems indicates that this approximate treatment is adequate for the field strengths we consider .",
    "we used a similar monte carlo model recently for studies of hot hole lasers@xcite .",
    "all simulations are done at a lattice temperature of 300k .",
    "they follow the progress of a single hole through a large number of scatterings ( typically @xmath7 ) , with the ergodic theorem being used to justify the use of the time - average as an ensemble average .",
    "often a very large number of scatterings was needed in order to make sure the statistical errors in the hall parameter were small enough .",
    "our material parameters are listed in table [ table - sige ] .",
    "the monte carlo simulations used the standard overestimation technique where for each scattering process the post - scattering direction of the hole was chosen at random , and the differential scattering rate was overestimated by an isotropic rate just higher than its maximum value .",
    "normally this would be very slow for the ionised impurity scattering , especially at low impurity concentrations .",
    "consequently , we use an optimised scheme @xcite that weights the choice of scattering angle by the angular dependence of the scattering rate , and thus avoid generating a large proportion of inefficient overestimations .",
    "the hall co - efficient @xmath4 is very sensitive to both the shape and non - parabolicity of the bandstructure , as well as the anisotropy of the scattering processes .",
    "this means that the role of ionised impurity scattering can be crucial  not only the presence or absence of impurities makes a difference ; different impurity concentrations can produce hall factors that vary with alloy concentration in both quantatively and qualitatively different ways . as a result",
    "we need to compare our simulation results with experiment to ascertain whether our model is sufficiently accurate and include all the necessary important features .",
    "experimental results for the hall factor in relaxed sige have been reported by chen et.al .",
    "@xcite for impurity concentrations of about @xmath8@xmath9 ; and in sige strained to a si substrate by joelsson et.al .",
    "@xcite for @xmath10@xmath9 .",
    "a comparison of these experimental results with monte carlo simulations has been done by dijkstra @xcite , whose simulations used linearly interpolated band parameters and neglected ionised impurity scattering .",
    "we have done equivalent simulations to those of dijkstra , and include the results here .    to calculate the hall factor",
    ", we use the efficient estimator of the hall mobility @xmath11 presented by @xcite , @xmath12    and then since @xmath13 , the drift mobility is @xmath14    we did our simulations with no electric field , and a magnetic field in the @xmath15 $ ] direction , in accordance with experiment ; magnetic field strengths of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or @xmath18 t were investigated .",
    "we used a strain equivalent to that as if the si@xmath19ge@xmath1 alloy had been grown as an epitaxial layer on a ( 001)si substrate .",
    "this means the usual strain parameter @xmath20 , since the lattice parameter of si is smaller than that for ge .",
    "our alloy scattering potential was @xmath21ev .",
    "note that some authors @xcite , on the basis of fits to mobilities and other transport parameters , prefer a stronger alloy scattering potential ( @xmath22ev ) ; other discussions of the effect of alloy potential ( and high impurity concentrations ) can be found in @xcite .",
    "we do not expect our results for @xmath4 to be particularly sensitive to the strength of the alloy potential , as alloy scattering is isotropic .",
    "this assumption was confirmed by a set of simulations on undoped sige using the monte carlo program of dijkstra@xcite .",
    "however , we would expect the drift mobility to diminish for higher concentrations of germanium is a stronger alloy scattering potential were chosen .",
    "comparison with experimental results can be seen on fig .",
    "[ graph - compexpb0030 ] , where those for @xmath23@xmath9 ( @xmath24 ) and @xmath25@xmath9 ( @xmath26 ) show a hall coefficient decreasing as the ge content increases .",
    "these clearly do not agree with our undoped monte carlo simulations at 0.3 t ( @xmath27 ) , although monte carlo simulations at the higher field of 2 t ( @xmath28 ) do also have dip at low - ge fraction .",
    "this dip at 2 t has been previously reported for monte carlo simulations without ionised impurity scattering @xcite .",
    "however , the 2 t simulations have a minimum @xmath4 at 15% ge , with a subsequent increase  at 40% ge @xmath4 is well above 1 .",
    "this is contrary to experiments , where @xmath4 continues to decrease up to 36% ge .",
    "however , it is clear that for undoped sige ( fig .",
    "[ graph - compexpb0030 ] , @xmath29 ) , there is no dip like that seen in experiments on doped material  hence , results for undoped sige do _ not _ explain the experiment .",
    "our simulations with @xmath30 t and @xmath31@xmath32 ) are shown on fig .",
    "[ graph - compexpb0030 ] ( also repeated on fig .",
    "[ graph - compareb0030 ] ) . these can be seen to match remarkably well with the experimental data taken at @xmath33 and @xmath34@xmath9 , making it clear that it is important to include the ionised impurity scattering in a model intended to reproduce the experimental value of @xmath4 .",
    "we can conclude that when impurity scattering dominates , @xmath4 stays low up to high ge concentrations , a case which contrasts with that studied by dykstra , who did not include impurity scattering .",
    "our results thus agree much better with experiment than his  indeed , the importance of impurity scattering was suggested by dykstra as a reason for the discrepancy he noticed .",
    "the full range of @xmath4 values from the monte carlo results are shown on figs .",
    "[ graph - compareb0030 ] , [ graph - compareb0100 ] , [ graph - compareb0200 ] for a range of @xmath35 values .",
    "these emphasise the role of impurity scattering  the @xmath4 values in undoped and low doping simulations are significantly higher than those for higher doping .",
    "comparison of our monte carlo simulation results for doped strained si@xmath0ge@xmath1 with experimental results @xcite have clearly shown that ionised impurity scattering has an important role in determining the hall parameter @xmath4 .",
    "this was shown by simulations which without ionised impurity scattering failed to give agreement with experiment , but with it gave good agreement .",
    "this was despite using a linearly interpolated set of band parameters , so clearly the interpolation scheme is less important than the impurity scattering mechanism .    following on from this work",
    ", it would be good to reduce the statistical errors in the hall co - efficients further .",
    "this would enable us to make comparisons between different interpolation schemes for the si@xmath0ge@xmath1 parameters .",
    "also , the behaviour of the hall parameter in relaxed si@xmath0ge@xmath1 would be interesting to consider .",
