    "the universal scaling between the structural relaxation time , or the shear viscosity , and @xmath11 was reported for several numerical models , including linear polymers , mixtures , prototypical glassformers like @xmath12 and o - terphenyl ( otp ) , and icosahedral glassformer @xcite .",

    ", the scaling of these systems and ckn will be discussed from the viewpoint of the pressure - energy correlations @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is shown that the role of the free volume in glycerol is not negligible and that the scaling works only if the observation time of the fast dynamics is _ shorter _ than the time scales of the relaxation processes @xcite .",

    "strongly correlating systems , e.g. van der waals liquids , have isomorphic states .",
    "rigorously , any general theory of the liquid state must end up in relations expressed only in terms of isomorph invariants ( constant quantities when evaluated over a set of isomorphic states ) to deal with the strongly correlating systems ( a criterion also known as the  isomorph filter  @xcite ) . from this respect ,",

    "[ eq : scaledparabola ] and [ dyredensityquad ] be discriminated ?",

    "the experimental data plotted in fig.[figure1 ] are taken at ambient pressure by sweeping the temperature in a limited range , thus resulting in small density changes .",
    "owing to the much larger changes of the structural relaxation time , the viscosity and msd , the equalities @xmath42 , @xmath43 hold to a good approximation and eqs .",

    "if no clear - cut conclusion on the experimental side may be still drawn , numerical studies offer more insight .",
    "in particular , eqs . [ eq : scaledparabola ] and [ dyredensityquad ] were investigated in the temperature / density phase space of a class of model polymers with different chain lengths and generalized lennard - jones potentials having constant position and depth of their minimum @xcite .",
    "note that pressure - energy correlations change with the potential and the physical state @xcite .",
    "the different systems were compared with no msd or @xmath5 rescaling and eq.[eq : scaledparabola ] was used as master curve by taking @xmath44 as a constant independent of the model polymer .",
    "these positions : i ) rely on the finding that the raw curves @xmath5 vs @xmath45 for different systems superimpose very well , ii ) fit in with the need to limit the number of adjustable parameters . to keep on an equal footing the comparison between the two master curves , an analogous position was adopted for eq .",
    "[ dyredensityquad ] , i.e. @xmath46 was set to a constant independent of the model polymer ( a step still preserving the isomorph invariance of eq.[dyredensityquad ] ) .",
    "on this basis , eq . [ eq : scaledparabola ] was found to be more consistent with the numerical data ( see fig.11 of ref .",

    "the basic question is about the existence of some critical displacement above which structural changes take place and it was stated that the rearrangement only takes place when there is a local , temporary density decrease @xcite .",
    "we refer also to previous experimental @xcite , theoretical and simulation @xcite work .    the ratio between the volume that is accessible to the monomer center - of - mass and the monomer volume is @xmath47 in md units @xcite . from our simulation data ( first line of table [ tab : detailed ] )",
    "one finds : @xmath48 flory and coworkers proposed that the glass transition takes place under iso - free volume conditions with the universal value @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "this supports the conclusion that @xmath50 and the free volume are related , as above noted .    to better elucidate the matter",
    ", we consider results from the positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy ( pals ) @xcite .",
    "pals is a structural technique to parametrize the free volume .",
    "in fact , the orthopositronium bound state of a positron has a strong tendency to localize in holes of low electron density and decays with lifetime @xmath51 being related to the average cavity size . in particular",
    ", we test the ansatz : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a constant .",
    "the above equation captures the essentials of the relation between @xmath51 and @xmath11 , both increasing with the free volume .",
    "furthermore , it provides a simple procedure to compare pals and @xmath11 data with no adjustable parameters .",
    "in fact , eq.[u2proptotau3 ] yields the equality @xmath54 , with @xmath55 , i.e. the reduced msd is equal to the reduced pals lifetime @xmath51 . in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] the viscosity data of glycerol were plotted by replacing the reduced msd with the reduced @xmath51 and comparing the results to the master curve expressed by eq . [ eq : scaledparabola ] .",
    "the conversion factor between the actual and the md viscosity units was adjusted to @xmath56 .",
    "other parameters like in table [ tab : detailed ] .",
    "[ figure3 ] shows that the scaling of the long - time dynamics by either the reduced @xmath57 or the reduced msd are quite close to each other over about ten decades in relaxation times , thus leading to the conclusion that @xmath50 and free - volume are correlated .",
    "deviations are observed for glycerol when cage restructuring , and then the free - volume fluctuations , occurs on time scales shorter than the pals observation time , i.e. @xmath58 ( see also ref.@xcite ) . in this regime",
    "the cage dynamics still takes place ( it is detectable for @xmath59 ) and @xmath11 is still well - defined @xcite but the observation time @xmath51 is too long and almost temperature - independent @xcite .    it must be noted that pals data are usually interpreted by a model assuming the spherical shape of the hole where the positron decays .",
    "the model relates @xmath57 to the hole radius @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "in addition to eq.[u2proptotau3 ] , we also tested the relation @xmath61 ( @xmath60 drawn by the fit of @xmath57 data ) and found that the correlation plot between @xmath62 and @xmath63 agrees with the master curve expressed by eq .",
    "[ eq : scaledparabola ] with @xmath64 .",
    "however , being a model - dependent conclusion involving adjustable parameters , we think that the analysis of the free - volume role in terms of eq . [ u2proptotau3 ] is more robust .",
    "we now proceed and better clarify that the correct investigation of the cage rattling is ensured if the observation time of the fast dynamics is _ shorter _ than @xmath5 .",
    "[ figure4 ] shows the correlation between @xmath45 and the viscosity data of glycerol .",
    "@xmath45 was taken as the mean square displacement within the time @xmath33 , the latter depending on the energy resolution of the neutron scattering ( ns ) experiment .",
    "it is seen that the scaling between the long - time dynamics and @xmath65 is rather good even for @xmath66 , whereas using @xmath67 leads to deviations from the universal master curve if @xmath68 .",
    "this suggests that , if @xmath69 , @xmath70 is contributed by components which are not related to the cage vibrational dynamics .",
    "one anticipates that these components have relaxational character .",
    "interestingly , @xmath71 from pals tracks the universal master curve of the structural relaxation down to @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( fig.[figure3 ] ) .",
    "the finding seems to indicate that in the range @xmath74 the free - volume is less affected by the relaxation than msd on the nanosecond time scale .",
    "the above discussion supports the conclusion that cage - rattling msd must be measured on time scales @xmath33 shorter than the time scales due to both the structural and the possible local relaxations . shortening @xmath33 results in a remarkable extension of the region where the scaling between the structural relaxation and the cage dynamics of glycerol is observed ( fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) . however , this effect is less apparent in otp @xcite .",
    "it is shown that one molten salt ( ckn ) and one hydrogen - bonded liquid ( glycerol ) exhibit the scaling between the mean - square displacement due to cage rattling , @xmath45 , and the structural relaxation time or viscosity already observed in supercooled liquids , polymers and metallic glasses .",
    "systems with both negligible ( like ckn , glycerol , sio@xmath16 , geo@xmath16 and b@xmath16o@xmath17 ) and high pressure - energy correlations ( like otp , tnb or polymers ) exhibit the above scaling . according to the available experiments , an isomorph - invariant expression of the master curve of the scaled data is not distinguishable from a simpler not - invariant expression . instead , the latter agrees better with the simulations of a wide class of model polymers .",
    "the cage rattling of glycerol is contributed by free - volume over about ten decades in relaxation times .",
