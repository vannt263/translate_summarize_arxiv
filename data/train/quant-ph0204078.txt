    "caldeira and leggett studied the influence of @xmath16 on the quantum tunneling of the target system @xmath17 and they found that the quantum tunneling is suppressed by the ohmic dissipation @xcite . following their analysis ,",
    "many theoretical works have been done and the localization ( quantum - classical ) transition has been suggested to occur @xcite .",
    "the validity of their results have been suggested by elaborate experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical works so far ( instanton , perturbation , etc . ) depend on some expansions with respect to small parameters which are not always valid .",
    "for example , for evaluation of the tunneling rate through the double well barrier , @xmath18 the dilute gas instanton calculation is valid only in @xmath19 region @xcite .",
    "in this letter we adopt the non - perturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) method @xcite to analyze the dissipative quantum tunneling in the caldeira - leggett model .",
    "since the nprg is formulated without any series expansion , it is a powerful tool to analyze the non - perturbative features of quantum field theory , such as the phase structure of the theory @xcite . for the quantum tunneling problem",
    ", the nprg method can reproduce the exact tunneling rate through the double well barrier ( eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) ) in the wide parameter @xmath20 region @xcite .",
    "therefore the nprg is expected to be effective in the non - perturbative analysis of the dissipative quantum tunneling .",
    "we can discuss the possibility of the localization ( quantum - classical ) transition by investigating the `` phase structure '' of the dissipative quantum mechanics .",
    "the nprg also helps us to interpret the effects of @xmath16 as effective infrared or ultraviolet cutoffs for the quantum fluctuation , and we can readily understand the dissipation effects as suppression or enhancement of the quantum features of the effective target system @xcite .",
    "the effective interaction @xmath16 defined in eq .",

    "generally @xmath16 consists of the local component @xmath27 and the non - local component @xmath28 .",
    "we identify the component @xmath28 as the dissipation term , since it corresponds to the odd power term in the fourier transform and then it is related to the time reversal symmetry breaking . on the other hand , the component @xmath27 consists of the even power term in the fourier transform and then it does not contribute the time reversal symmetry breaking in the effective classical equation of motion , that is , it is irrelevant to the dissipation . therefore , we introduce a suitable conterterm in the euclidean action @xmath11 to cancel the component @xmath27 @xcite .    for the ohmic dissipation @xmath25 , we identify the dissipative part as follows : @xmath29&=&\\!\\frac{\\eta}{4\\pi}\\int d\\tau\\!\\int ds~ \\frac{\\left(~q(\\tau)-q(s)~\\right)^2}{|\\tau -s|^2}.\\label{8 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it should be noted that the dissipation term , @xmath30 $ ] , never breaks the time reversal symmetry in the action level .",

    "we study the influence of the dissipation term @xmath28 on the quantum behaviors of @xmath7 .",
    "now let us proceed to the nprg analysis of the caldeira - leggett model @xcite . originally the nprg method has been formulated and used mainly in the statistical mechanics or the quantum field theory to analyze the critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "recently , the nprg method has been found even effective in the quantum mechanics particularly for the non - perturbative analysis @xcite .",
    "we derive the nprg equation for the quantum mechanics with the dissipation term . in the nprg method ,",
    "the theory is defined as an effective theory with a high frequency cutoff @xmath36 , and is described by the wilsonian effective action @xmath37 $ ] , which changes with respect to the scale @xmath36 .",
    "we now employ the local potential approximation ( lpa ) , @xmath38&=&\\int d\\tau \\left [ ~\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{q}^2 + \\frac{\\eta}{4\\pi}\\int ds \\frac{\\left(~q(\\tau)-q(s)~\\right)^2}{|\\tau -s|^2 } + v_{\\lambda}(q ) ~\\right],\\label{10 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the effective action is limited to have only local potential term , the wilsonian effective potential @xmath39 , in addition to the fixed kinetic term and the fixed dissipation term .",
    "both the particle mass @xmath40 and the dissipation strength @xmath31 are constant and only the wilsonian effective potential @xmath39 is changed as the scale @xmath36 is lowered .",
    "note that the lpa is the leading order of the derivative expansion of @xmath37 $ ] and has nothing to do with the prescription that we ignore the local part @xmath27 in the component @xmath16 .",
    "the lpa means that any quantum correction to the derivative coupling is ignored , but does not mean that any quantum correction from the derivative coupling is ignored .",
    "we carry out the path integration over the highest frequency degrees of freedom of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , up to the one - loop order , @xmath43 where we have omitted a proper constant term which should make the argument of the logarithm to be dimensionless , since it contributes only to the @xmath44-independent part of the effective action . taking the limit @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) , we have the nprg equation @xmath46 which should be called the lpa wegner - houghton equation with dissipation .",
    "this is because in the @xmath47 limit eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) becomes the ordinary lpa wegner - houghton equation @xcite , which describes the change of the wilsonian effective potential @xmath39 with respect to the scale @xmath36 .",
    "the extra term @xmath48 originates from the dissipation term @xmath28 . the nprg equation ( eq . (",
    "[ 12 ] ) ) is obtained with the approximation lpa ; the leading order of the derivative expansion of @xmath37 $ ] . the derivative expansion does not rely on any small parameter which controls the series expansion , and therefore the effectiveness of the nprg equation",
    "is expected to be free from the smallness of the parameters in the system .",
    "we regard the system variable @xmath17 as a _",
    "macroscopic _ collective coordinate and discuss how the quantum mechanical behavior of the macroscopic coordinate @xmath17 is affected by the environmental effects . as a typical phenomenon",
    ", the quantum tunneling of @xmath17 has been analyzed by many authors @xcite .",
    "we set the bare potential of @xmath17 as the double well type ( eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) ) . in this system with vanishing @xmath31 , the coordinate @xmath17 tunnels through the potential barrier",
    "and it oscillates between two wells .",
    "the main question is whether it also oscillates or not even in the @xmath49 quantum dissipative dynamics .",
    "such an oscillating behavior is particularly called the _ macroscopic quantum coherence _ and the inclination of ceasing the oscillation corresponds to _ decoherence _ @xcite .",
    "now we briefly summarize the previous results obtained for the macroscopic quantum coherence in double well potential systems with the ohmic dissipation .",
    "usually the first energy gap @xmath50 is calculated as the physical quantity because it corresponds to the tunneling amplitude between two wells .",
    "caldeira - leggett evaluated it by using the semi - classical ( instanton ) approximation which is valid for @xmath19 and the perturbation with respect to @xmath31 , and then they found the dissipation term @xmath28 suppresses the quantum tunneling @xcite .",
    "renormalization group analyses have been done for the instanton gas system within the dilute gas approximation which is valid also for @xmath19 and @xmath51 region @xcite .",
    "they predict a remarkable phenomenon that @xmath52 vanishes at a critical value @xmath53 , where the decoherence occurs .",
    "this phenomenon is often called the _ quantum - classical transition _ because the system looks classical in a limited sense that the quantum tunneling does not occur @xcite .",
    "this is nothing but the spontaneous @xmath54 symmetry breaking . in these works",
    "the energy gap @xmath52 was treated as the order parameter of the transition .",
    "these results are obtained by using the semi - classical approximation and/or the perturbation theory with respect to @xmath31 .",
    "their reliability depend on the smallness of the couplings @xmath55 and @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , to get more general and reliable results free of such limitation , we must employ an analyzing tool which does not need the series expansion with respect to any couplings .",
    "we expect our method using the lpa wegner - houghton equation with dissipation ( eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) ) will work best for the large coupling region , because the employed approximation , lpa , is the leading order of the derivative expansion and does not depend any small parameter .",
    "in fact , it has been found that the nprg analysis of quantum tunneling based on the lpa wegner - houghton equation works very well in the wide parameter ( @xmath56 ) region @xcite .",
    "we analyze the dissipative quantum tunneling by solving the nprg equation ( eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) ) numerically .",
    "this equation is a two - dimensional partial differential equation for the wilsonian effective potential @xmath39 with respect to @xmath36 and @xmath17 .",
    "the initial condition of the potential is the bare potential @xmath57 at the initial cutoff @xmath58 .",
    "we solve the differential equation toward the infrared limit @xmath59 and finally obtain the physical effective potential @xmath60 .",
    "we can exploit the physical information of the quantum system from the effective potential @xmath61 .",
    "first of all , the frequency squared starting with the negative value @xmath62 finally reaches a positive value ( for small @xmath31 ) , @xmath63 , that is , the effective potential @xmath61 becomes a single well form .",
    "it means that due to the quantum tunneling , the @xmath54 symmetry ( parity ) does not break spontaneously , and the expectation value of @xmath17 is vanishing .",
    "the tunneling effects are automatically incorporated when we integrate ( solve ) the nprg equation toward the infrared .",
    "it should be noted that for non - vanishing @xmath31 , the simple equivalence between the energy gap @xmath52 and the effective frequency @xmath64 , @xmath65 @xcite , does not hold .",
    "the long range ( @xmath66 ) behavior of the two point function @xmath67 is actually independent of @xmath64 and is determined by @xmath31 with power damp behavior even in case of infinitesimal @xmath31 .",
    "this singular behavior comes from the nature of the environmental degrees of freedom where the harmonic oscillator frequencies are assumed to distribute continuously up to zero ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "even if there is an infrared cutoff , it does not change the situation much and the lowest frequency environment dominates the long range correlator of the target system . in this sense the semi - classical arguments calculating the first energy gap @xmath50 as the order parameter of the quantum - classical transition in the quantum dissipative systems seems somewhat doubtful , because the correspondence between the tunneling amplitude and the first energy gap @xmath52 comes form the long range behavior of the transition amplitude .    here , instead of analyzing the long range correlator",
    ", we adopt another physical quantity to describe the possible quantum - classical transition , the localization susceptibility .",
    "we add a source term @xmath69 to the euclidean action @xmath11 ( eq . (",
    "[ 3 ] ) ) .",
    "then the localization susceptibility @xmath70 is defined by @xmath71 and it is exactly given by the effective potential as follows : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a minimum of @xmath61 and it is actually vanishing in the sub - critical region .",
    "these definitions are valid also for non - vanishing @xmath31 .",
    "if we find a divergent and scaling behavior of @xmath70 toward @xmath74 , we may conclude that the localization transition occurs at @xmath75 and it is the second order phase transition .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : ohm ] for several values of @xmath55 . in previous works for @xmath76 system @xcite , the nprg analyses have been found to work excellently in these @xmath20 region ( @xmath77 $ ] ) while the dilute gas instanton approximation does not work at all there .",
    "therefore , we expect the nprg analysis also works well for these @xmath20 values even in @xmath49 systems .",
    "we find that for every value of @xmath55 , @xmath64 decreases as @xmath31 becomes large .",
    "this @xmath31 and @xmath55 dependence of @xmath64 is naturally understandable by considering the dissipation effect in eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) .",
    "the quantum fluctuation of the dynamical variable @xmath17 is suppressed bellow the effective infrared cutoff @xmath78 . therefore , the larger @xmath31 causes the stronger cutoff effect and results in the smaller @xmath64 .",
    "for larger @xmath55 , the effective frequency of the system is larger , and therefore larger @xmath31 is required to effectively cutoff the quantum fluctuation .",
    "these behaviors are qualitatively consistent with those of @xmath52 obtained by the instanton approximation .",
    "then , what happens for large @xmath31 case ?",
    "the expected phenomenon is the quantum - classical transition characterized by complete disappearance of the tunneling .",
    "the nprg method may not work precisely in the @xmath79 region because eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) becomes singular there and the numerical error increases .",
    "therefore , according to the standard technique of analyzing the critical phenomena , we evaluate the critical dissipation @xmath75 from the diverging behavior of the localization susceptibility .",
    "we fit @xmath80 with the critical exponent form @xmath81 we show an example of fit for @xmath82 $ ] in fig.[fig : sus ] .",
    "we conclude that the localization susceptibility exhibits a divergent behavior with a power scaling , which indicates the second order phase transition of localization .",
    "we obtain the critical dissipation @xmath75 and the critical exponent @xmath83 for these @xmath55 , which are plotted in fig.[fig : eg ] .",
    "the previous analysis using the dilute gas instanton gives a simple relation @xmath53 which is also shown in fig.[fig : eg ] for comparison .",
    "the nprg results for @xmath75 are systematically larger compared to those of the instanton . as for the critical exponent @xmath83",
    ", we observe the universality property except for the smallest @xmath84 $ ] , where nprg results may not be reliable .",
    "the nprg works very well in the large @xmath55 region @xcite . strictly speaking ,",
    "tunneling phenomena are no longer characteristic in such parameter region .",
    "it can be easily seen by evaluating a dimensionless quantity @xmath85 , which is the ratio of the zero - point energy of the particle at each well with @xmath76 to the height of the inter - well barrier .",
    "tunneling phenomena are dominant for @xmath86 case . for @xmath84 $ ]",
    ", @xmath87 is obtained .",
    "therefore , our analysis in the large @xmath55 region ( @xmath77 $ ] ) rather claims suppression of the quantum oscillation over the small inter - well barrier .",
    "the critical phenomenon that we observed here is induced by a destruction of the quantum coherence and can be interpreted as spontaneous @xmath54 symmetry breaking - like phenomenon in quantum mechanics .",
    "the caldeira - leggett model for dissipative quantum mechanics was analyzed by means of the nprg method .",
    "we derived the lpa wegner - houghton equation with dissipation , which is the local potential approximated nprg equation with the ohmic dissipation term .",
    "we applied it to analysis of dissipative quantum tunneling ( or dissipative quantum oscillation ) and investigated whether the quantum - classical transition occurs or not .",
    "since the first energy gap @xmath50 is unsuitable as the order parameter of the dissipative phase transition , we calculated the localization susceptibility @xmath70 from the effective potential @xmath61 .",
    "the observed @xmath70 diverges toward @xmath88 with the critical scaling , and therefore we concluded that @xmath89 is the critical dissipation for the quantum - classical transition and this transition seems the second order phase transition .",
    "the values of the critical dissipation @xmath89 are rather larger than the values obtained by the semi - classical analyses , where the first energy gap @xmath52 is used as the order parameter of the quantum - classical transition . as for the non - ohmic dissipations , the analogous systematic study using the nprg equation",
    "will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there must remain , however , many fundamental and subtle problems to be studied about the notion of quantum - classical transition and the critical dissipation .",
    "the nprg method will be effective also for those problems .",
