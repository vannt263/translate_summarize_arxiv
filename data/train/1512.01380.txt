    "let us begin with a brief review on the unifying framework of scalar - tensor theories .",
    "the most general scalar - tensor theory with second - order field equations is given by the horndeski lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , it turns out that the horndeski lagrangian can be written equivalently in the modern form of the generalized galileon  @xcite as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the ( four - dimensional ) ricci scalar and the einstein tensor , respectively , and we have four arbitrary functions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . performing an adm decomposition by taking @xmath7const hypersurfaces as constant time hypersurfaces , one obtains the lagrangian of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the extrinsic and intrinsic curvature tensors on the constant @xmath5 hypersurfaces .",
    "the functions of @xmath5 and @xmath11 in the covariant lagrangian  ( [ hor - cov ] ) are now regarded as the functions of the time coordinate @xmath12 and the lapse function @xmath13 in the adm language .",
    "we thus should have four functions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and indeed @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 obey @xmath18 leaving four arbitrary functions as expected .",
    "this is the unitary gauge description of the horndeski theory which is particularly useful in the study of cosmology .    the scalar degree of freedom is apparently hidden in the unitary gauge description .",
    "however , variation of  ( [ hor - adm ] ) with respect to @xmath13 yields a second - class constraint eliminating one degree of freedom rather than two .",
    "this fact signifies the presence of the scalar degree of freedom .",
    "one notices here that the relations  ( [ hor - rel ] ) play no role when counting the degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , the degrees of freedom remain the same even if one liberates @xmath14 and @xmath15 from  ( [ hor - rel ] ) and considers the theory with six arbitrary functions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "this trick was first used by gleyzes _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to construct the glpv scalar - tensor theory beyond horndeski .",
    "since the glpv theory is more general than horndeski , the covariant equations of motion are of higher order in general",
    ". nevertheless , the true propagating degrees of freedom are one scalar and two tensors as in the horndeski theory  @xcite .",
    "( note , however , that counting the degrees of freedom using the unitary gauge lagrangian involves subtle points  @xcite . )",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for attempts to extend the horndeski theory in different directions .",
    "the glpv theory can further be generalized while retaining the number of propagating degrees of freedom as demonstrated by gao  @xcite .",
    "the key is to notice that one no longer needs to impose the specific combinations of @xmath9 and @xmath10 as presented in eq .",
    "( [ hor - adm ] ) .",
    "now one arrives at the unifying framework of scalar - tensor theories which is given by the sum of three dimensional scalars composed of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath19 , with coefficients depending on @xmath12 and @xmath13 : @xmath20 the `` six - parameter '' subclass of the above lagrangian with @xmath21 corresponds to the glpv theory . by imposing the further restrictions  ( [ hor - rel ] ) we have the `` four - parameter '' subclass which reproduces the horndeski theory .",
    "even ( the healthy extension of ) hova gravity  @xcite is included within this framework . among possible terms",
    "gao considers 28 operators satisfying the requirements that ( i ) there are no derivatives higher than two when going back to the covariant lagrangian and ( ii ) the number of second - order derivative operators does not exceed three  @xcite .",
    "we shall work in gao s framework to cover a fairly wide range of single - field inflation models , and evaluate all possible tensor 3-point functions .",
    "as explained below , the number of operators that are relevant to tensor perturbations is in fact not as large as 28 .",
    "let us now simplify the lagrangian before computing the quadratic and cubic terms of tensor perturbations .",
    "we define the tensor perturbations @xmath22 by @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath22 is transverse and traceless .",
    "we simply have @xmath25 with this definition . as a consequence of the traceless and transverse nature of @xmath22",
    ", the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor , @xmath26 , can be written solely in terms of the background quantities .",
    "one sees that the intrinsic curvature scalar @xmath27 does not contain any first - order terms up to total derivatives .",
    "these facts lead us to the following 14 terms that are relevant to the tensor perturbations : @xmath28 here , the coefficients may be regarded as the functions of @xmath12 since we have set @xmath29 .",
    "it is convenient to split the extrinsic curvature into the background and perturbation parts as @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 with a dot standing for differentiation with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "it can be seen directly that @xmath33 is traceless , @xmath34 .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ k - split ] ) to the lagrangian  ( [ effl1 ] ) and extracting the perturbations , we obtain @xmath35 where the coefficients are defined as @xmath36 those coefficients are determined once the concrete form of the lagrangian is fixed and the background cosmological evolution is obtained . the reduced lagrangian  ( [ eq : relevant action ] ) is sufficient for deriving the most general quadratic and cubic lagrangians for the tensor perturbations within gao s unifying framework of scalar - tensor theories .    in the glpv subclass",
    ", we have only four non - vanishing coefficients , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , all of which are arbitrary . in the horndeski case , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are fixed by @xmath37 and @xmath40 via the relations  ( [ hor - rel ] ) , and hence we have essentially two functional degrees of freedom , though all four of these coefficients are still non - vanishing",
    ". thus , even if one generalizes the horndeski theory to glpv , no new terms appear in the lagrangian for the tensor perturbations , though the coefficients can be chosen more freely in the glpv theory .",
    "the other four terms appear for the first time when going to gao s framework .",
    "in particular , the @xmath41 and @xmath42 terms are completely new , while the @xmath43 and @xmath44 terms can be found in the specific case of hoava gravity as well .",
    "from eq .  ( [ eq : relevant action ] ) we obtain the quadratic action for the tensor perturbations  @xcite : @xmath45,\\label{quadaction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 the third term modifies the dispersion relation .",
    "this term is absent in the horndeski theory and even in its glpv generalization , but it appears in more general theories in the unifying framework .",
    "the goal of this section is to present the power spectrum of primordial tensor modes with the modified dispersion relation .",
    "primordial perturbations with this type of the dispersion relation have been studied _ e.g. _ , in refs .",
    "@xcite , with an emphasis on the curvature perturbation .    before calculating the linear solution and the power spectrum ,",
    "let us comment on the stability conditions derived from the quadratic action  ( [ quadaction ] ) .",
    "it is required that @xmath47 to avoid ghost instabilities .",
    "we also impose the condition @xmath48 in order for the modes with high momenta to be stable . if @xmath49 then the tensor perturbations are stable at low momenta as well .",
    "( however , in fact @xmath50 can be negative for a short period provided that @xmath51 , because the instability grows only at low momenta and hence is not catastrophic . )",
    "we move to the fourier space , @xmath52 and solve the equation of motion for @xmath53 , @xmath54 where we have introduced the conformal time defined by @xmath55 .    to obtain an exact solution to eq .",
    "( [ perteq ] ) and manipulate the non - gaussianity in a tractable way , we make the following assumptions on the background quantities .",
    "first , the background cosmological evolution is assumed to be exact de sitter , so that the scale factor is given by @xmath56 .",

    "( otherwise , the dominant source of non - gaussianity in the cmb comes from the tensor modes , but if so @xmath155 can be constrained directly from cmb observations . ) then , using the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath156 and the nonlinearity parameters @xmath157 , we have @xmath158 where we have made the second assumption that different @xmath159 s do not cancel each other .",
    "thus , we obtain the constraint @xmath160 which is translated to @xmath161 or , equivalently , @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation . note the mass dimensions of the coefficients : @xmath164=1,~[b_6]=0,~[a_7]=-1,$ ] and @xmath165=-2 $ ] .",
    "thus , the current constraints are very weak .",
    "in this paper , we have clarified primordial non - gaussianities of tensor modes by computing the tensor 3-point functions within the unifying framework of scalar - tensor theories  @xcite .",
    "the framework includes the horndeski theory and recent glpv generalization as specific cases .",
    "we have shown that no new terms appear in the cubic lagrangian even if one goes to the glpv theory beyond horndeski . in more general theories beyond glpv , we have found four new interactions , one of which is related to the modification of the dispersion relation in the linear theory .",
    "the impact of this modification of the dispersion relation can be parametrized using a small parameter @xmath89 , and we have computed the 3-point functions analytically by treating @xmath89 as a small expansion parameter .",
    "two of the four new terms beyond glpv have already been studied to leading order in @xmath89 in the context of hoava gravity  @xcite , and our results are in agreement with those in ref .",
    "@xcite where they overlap . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that there are only two independent terms in the cubic lagrangian within horndeski : the standard one present already in general relativity generating squeezed non - gaussianity with the _ fixed _ amplitude and the other nonstandard one predicting equilateral non - gaussianity .",
    "we have strengthened this statement by showing that at leading order in the @xmath89 expansion the squeezed non - gaussianity is only generated by this `` standard '' cubic term and has the fixed amplitude , @xmath149 , even in the general unifying framework of scalar - tensor theories . at leading order in @xmath89 all the other non - gaussian amplitudes peak at equilateral shapes .",
    "the `` standard '' interaction is quite likely to be present in the cubic lagrangian because it can easily be generated from the term linear in the ricci scalar .",
    "the fixed and universal nature of @xmath149 thus provides us the `` consistency relation '' in the primordial tensor sector .",
    "any detection of the equilateral tensor non - gaussianity would imply the nonstandard interactions between gravity and the scalar degree of freedom , though it is difficult to distinguish among different contributions .",
    "note that the inverse is not true ; even in the absence of equilateral non - gaussianity , gravity could be modified significantly from general relativity , because one can consider various nonstandard interactions that do not affect the tensor sector , as well as @xmath166 .",
    "we have found that the effects of the modified dispersion relation appear in the non - gaussian amplitudes at @xmath113 .",
    "the momentum dependences of the correction @xmath167 are similar to their leading order counterparts @xmath168 .",
    "it should be noted that the correction to the squeezed non - gaussianity , @xmath169 , breaks its fixed and universal nature .",
    "therefore , detection of squeezed tensor non - gaussianity whose amplitude is different from @xmath149 would imply a significant higher order term in the dispersion relation or the tensor modes of non - inflationary origin .",
    "let us mention here some other sources of gravitational waves from the early universe , as it would be interesting to explore tensor non - gaussian signatures of such origin in order to contrast them with the results in this paper . a spectator scalar field",
    "other than inflaton can produce gravitational waves  @xcite , though it is difficult to expect large amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "large tensor modes are produced , _",
    "e.g. _ , by self - ordering of multi - component scalar fields after a global phase transition  @xcite .",
    "vector fields can also source gravitational waves during inflation  @xcite .",
    "we hope that we will come back to the issue of non - gaussian signatures of those gravitational waves in future publications .",
    "finally , it should be noted that by construction the present analysis does not cover multi - field inflation models .",
    "though the multi - field effects in the tensor sector are expected to be small , it would be interesting to investigate whether one can discriminate single- and multi - field models using primordial non - gaussianity of tensor modes .",

    ", we find that the disformal transformation maintains the form of the lagrangian for the tensor perturbations : @xmath178 where @xmath179 and we dropped the terms that are irrelevant to the tensor perturbations .",
