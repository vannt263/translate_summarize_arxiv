    "if one places a semiconducting heterostructure over a piezoelectric platelet along which acoustic surface wave ( saw ) is being propagated , the saw undergoes additional attenuation associated with the interaction of the electrons of heterostructure with the electric field of saw .",
    "this is the basis of the acoustic method pioneered by wixforth @xcite for the investigation of gaas / algaas heterostructures .",
    "in contrast to @xcite in the present work it has been found that in a gaas / algaas heterostructure ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) in the quantum hall regime the conductivities @xmath0 measured by an acoustic method do not coincide with @xmath3 obtained from the direct - current measurements : @xmath3 = 0 , whereas @xmath4 has a finite value depending on a temperature , magnetic field and saw intensity . and",
    "this is the main objective of the present work to elucidate the nature of this hf conductivity .",
    "the theoretical absorption coefficient can be presented in the following way @xcite : @xmath5 ^ 2 } , a=8b(k)(\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_0)\\epsilon_0 ^ 2\\epsilon_sexp(-2ka),\\label{eq : gam}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the electromechanical coupling coefficient of piezoelectric substrate , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the saw wavevector and the velocity respectively , @xmath9 is the vacuum gap width between the lithium niobate platelet and the sample , @xmath10 is the dissipative hf conductivity of 2deg , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the dielectric constants of lithium niobate , vacuum and semiconductor respectively ; @xmath14 and @xmath15 are some complex functions of @xmath9 , @xmath7 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . when @xmath16=1 , @xmath17 achieves the maximum @xmath18 . in the case",
    "when @xmath19 1 ( quantum hall regime ) @xmath20 .",
    "thus , the saw electronic attenuation may be taken as a measure of the heterostructure conductivity .",
    "the measurements were carried out in a temperature range 1.5 - 4.2k , and magnetic fields @xmath21 up to 7 t , with an acoustic frequency in the range of 30 - 150 mhz .",
    "two kinds of measurements were performed : for the first kind the acoustic power maintained low enough to provide the linearity of results , for the second kind a nonlinear behavior on acoustic power @xmath22 level was studied intensively at 1.5k .",
    "fig.1 illustrates the experimental dependences of @xmath17 on @xmath21 . as long as the saw attenuation factor",
    "is determined by the sample conductivity , quantizing of the electron spectrum in a magnetic field , leading to the sdh oscillations should result in similar peculiarities of the curves of fig 1 . in the present work the experimental data for the magnetic fields corresponding to the quantum hall regime will be analyzed .",
    "fig.2 presents the @xmath23 dependences ( f=30 mhz ) at magnetic fields 4.8 , 3.6 , and 2.9 t corresponding to the attenuation minima ( or the middle of the hall plateau ) , which are deduced from the curves of fig.1 , measured at different @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "as one can see from the figure , as @xmath24 grows , in a certain temperature range @xmath26 does not depend on a temperature , but at higher temperature begins to grow exponentially , the stronger @xmath21 , the higher @xmath24 at which the growth starts",
    ".    such a dependence could not be explained , if one supposes that @xmath27 is determined solely by the 2-dimensional electrons .",
    "indeed , in the quantum hall regime when the fermi level is in the middle between two landau levels , in the temperature range 1.5 - 4.2 k the temperature dependence of the 2-dimensional conductivity @xmath28 ( and corresponding attenuation @xmath29 ) is governed by the activation of electrons from the bound states at the fermi level to the upper landau band , i.e. @xmath30 .    the dependence of @xmath26 on temperature could be explained , if one supposes that at these levels of @xmath21 the attenuation adds up both from the saw attenuation @xmath29 by the 2-dimensional electrons , and @xmath31 , due to the electrons , localized on the impurities in the quasi-3-dimensional algaas layer , which supplies carriers to the 2-dimensional channel .    according to @xcite in a transverse magnetic field @xmath32 and",
    "does not depend on a temperature .",
    "thus the independence of @xmath26 on a temperature at low @xmath24 could be interpreted as a dominance of the conductivity of the quasi-3-dimensional layer . as @xmath24 rises",
    "the 2-dimensional conductivity becomes prevailing .",
    "based on the above arguments , @xmath29 has been determined as a difference between the experimentally obtained values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath35 is equal to the @xmath26 in the temperature range where @xmath26 is temperature - independent at the magnetic fields 4.8 and 3.6 t ( @xmath36 ) . at @xmath21=2.9 t , when there is no temperature flattening , @xmath35 was obtained , using the assumption that @xmath37 , @xcite . from the plotted dependence @xmath38",
    "the activation energy @xmath39 has been found at @xmath21= 4.8 , 3.6 , 2.9 t. fig.3 shows the @xmath39 dependence on @xmath21 .",
    "the activation energy obtained from the curves at different magnetic fields appeared to be less than the corresponding energy @xmath40 .",
    "this may be due to the landau level broadening _ a _ caused by the random fluctuation potential .",
    "supposing @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the plank constant , @xmath43 is the cyclotron frequency , from the ordinate cut - off point of the @xmath44 curve for @xmath21=2.1 t one could obtain @xmath45 , which appeared to be 3.4 mev .",
    "the slope of the @xmath46 line in fig.3 appeared to be 0.72 1/@xmath21 , which by 10% differs from the value @xmath47=0.8 1/@xmath21 , if @xmath48 for gaas ( @xmath49 - free electron mass ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath50 on @xmath22 at the same magnetic field is shown in fig.4 .",
    "it can be seen from the figure , that @xmath17 increases with the increase of @xmath22 . keeping in mind that at given magnetic fields @xmath29 is determined by the electron activation to the upper landau band from the fermi level",
    ", one could suppose that frenkel - pool effect i.e the activation energy decrease in electric field @xmath51 of a saw @xcite is operative in this case .",
    "@xmath52 where @xmath53 -carrier density in the upper landau level at a linear approach at 1.5k .",
    "@xmath54 plotted against @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , and @xmath51 is the electric field of saw @xcite , which can be presented by a straight line , confirms our model .",
    "high - frequency conductivity @xmath0 of a gaas / algaas heterostructure with a moderate mobility has been studied in the quantum hall regime ( @xmath57 by an acoustic contactless method .",
    "it has been shown that up to t=2k @xmath0 is determined by the hopping conductivity in thick , quasi three - dimensional layers of algaas well described by a pollak - geballe model @xcite .",
    "the two - dimensional hf conductivity in the quantum hall regime is governed by the electron activation into the upper landau band .",
    "the small value of this conductivity allows one to suppose it also to be of a hopping nature , but this point needs further arguments to be proved ."
