    "molecular outflows are a common occurrence in the evolution of young stellar objects ( ysos ) of all masses @xcite .",
    "the driving mechanism for these bipolar outflows is still a subject of considerable debate and most of our knowledge of this phenomenon is based on the study of low mass ysos @xcite .",
    "this is understandable because low mass ysos are more common , closer on average , and often are less obscured by dust than deeply embedded , high mass ysos .",
    "currently , models invoking centrifugally driven winds are a popular mechanism for driving these outflows in low mass ysos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in these models the magnetic field",
    "is twisted into a spiral pattern rising vertically off of the star s dense , rotating circumstellar disk .",
    "material entrained in this field is forced up the vertical axis and produces the observed collimated outflow @xcite .",
    "@xcite reviewed efforts to extend these magnetically driven wind models of bipolar outflows in low - mass stars to high mass yso s .",
    "it is not clear if the massive outflows associated with very luminous ysos are simply a scaled up version of these magnetically driven winds , or a completely different process .    determining the magnetic field geometry in massive bipolar outflows could provide important constraints on these models , but this is a difficult observational task .",
    "these outflows are most easily studied when the outflow axis lies in the plane of the sky and the star s equatorial disk is viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "this projection produces the classic bow - tie morphology seen in many sources and allows both poles of the outflow to be easily separated spatially on the sky .",
    "if dust grains in the bipolar lobes are aligned by the magnetic field in the outflow , then polarimetry of starlight shining through the outflow can measure the projected magnetic field geometry .",
    "if the pitch angle of a spiral magnetic field originating in the yso accretion disk produces a very tight spiral , then the measured field geometry will be perpendicular to the flow @xcite .",
    "polarimetry at infrared wavelengths was used by @xcite and @xcite to study the magnetic field geometry in the massive molecular outflow associated with dr21 .",
    "most of their observations were consistent with a magnetic field pointing radially outward , aligned with the axis of the outflow .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite using optical polarimetry of stars in the vicinity of cepheus a. however , optical polarimetry can not penetrate deep into obscured regions , and is more likely to measure the larger scale magnetic field geometry in which the star formation region is embedded .",
    "infrared ( ir ) polarimetry has the advantage of being able to penetrate the considerable dust extinction that typically accompanies deeply embedded massive ysos @xcite .",
    "this allows us to probe lines of sight more likely to pass through the denser portions of the outflow .",
    "imaging polarimetry provides additional information on the reflection nebulosity produced by the bipolar outflow .",
    "furthermore , at ir wavelengths , reflection nebulosity in heavily obscured regions close to the driving stellar source can be probed .",
    "polarimetry at longer wavelengths where the aligned dust grains are in emission avoids the need for background field stars . however , mm- and sub - mm polarimetry of regions with one or more massive outflows are sensitive to the magnetic field geometry associated only with warm dust near the massive yso s , not the more distant dust in the bipolar outflow .",
    "@xcite found a rough correlation between the position angle of the magnetic field in the warm dust centered on the yso and the direction of the outflow .",
    "when the outflow lies in the plane of the sky , the magnetic field tends to be perpendicular to the outflow axis , just the opposite of what is found further out in the outflow @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we employ the technique of imaging polarimetry at @xmath3 and @xmath4 of three compact regions with massive star formation : g@xmath5 , w42 , and cepheus a. g192.16 and ceph a are well known outflow systems and ceph a has had optical and near - ir polarimetry of surrounding stars @xcite .",
    "w42 was not previously known to contain an outflow , but we have discovered a very reddened , elongated reflection nebula in the cluster indicative of a bipolar outflow .",
    "for all three systems we present ir polarimetry of stars within and nearby the central star forming region and imaging polarimetry of the reflection nebulosity associated with the outflow .",
    "all observations were made with nsfcam @xcite in polarimetry mode on the nasa irtf 3-m telescope at a plate scale of 03 per pixel , resulting in a field of view of @xmath6 square . in polarimetry mode nsfcam",
    "utilizes a rotating half - wave plate at the entrance window of the camera and a wire grid polarizer in the secondary filter wheel .",
    "this allows the observer to form images at polarization position angles of 0 , 45 , 90 and 135@xmath7 on the sky . from these",
    "we compute stokes quantities @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) for stars and nebulosity within the image .",
    "details of the nsfcam ( + polarimeter ) technique are given in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "table 1 summarizes observational details and parameters of our targets .",
    "photometric and instrumental polarization calibrations were achieved by observing stars from the list of @xcite .",
    "unreddened early type stars in this list were assumed to have no polarization at the 0.1% level .",
    "measurements of several of these stars indicate that the instrumental polarization is less than 0.1% . because our technique requires a finite time between waveplate positions , sky and transmission fluctuations create systematic errors for single measurements at the @xmath12 level .",
    "these systematic effects are the primary source of error for bright objects .",
    "position angle and polarization efficiency calibrations were made by observing s1 in @xmath13 oph , which was assumed to have p@xmath14 , @xmath15 and p@xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "additional checks on the position angle callibration were provided by observing bn in orion and afgl 2591 .",
    "photometric magnitudes were transfromed from the natural irtf system @xcite to the modern mko system using the transformation relations described in @xcite .",
    "our ability to measure the polarization for stars depends on three factors .",
    "if the star is very faint , it will be impossible to measure the fractional polarization , given the typical values of a few percent for interstellar polarization .",
    "if the star is very bright , but has a very low intrinsic polarization , it will also be impossible to measure the polarization .",
    "finally , stars with images confused with nearby stars , stars in the negative ( sky ) beam , or stars embedded in bright nebulosity will also be impossible to accurately measure . in this paper",
    "we report polarimetry of stars only if the signal - to - noise for the fractional polarization @xmath18 is greater than 3 .",
    "interstellar polarization has long been attributed to the alignment of interstellar grains through some interaction with the magnetic field , such as a modified form of the classic davis - greenstein mechanism @xcite .",
    "there is little doubt that in the diffuse ism between stars magnetic alignment of some sort is the principle mechanism at work ( for a review of grain alignment , see @xcite ) .",
    "this conclusion is based on the pattern of optical polarization vectors in the milky way @xcite and comparisons between faraday studies at radio frequencies and optical / ir polarimetry in external galaxies @xcite",
    ". however , in specific locations not probed by these tests , other mechanisms might be dominant .",
    "these include the original mechanical mechanism of @xcite that used streaming motions of the gas as well as more advanced treatments @xcite and magneto - mechanical mechanisms such ambipolar diffusion @xcite .",
    "although there is no direct evidence for grain alignment by these mechanical mechanisms at this time , one location they might be expected to play a role is in the outflows from massive ysos , which will certainly have significant streaming motions in the gas .",
    "the direction of grain alignment ( long axis ) for the original gold mechanism is along the direction of the flow .",
    "this is perpendicular to the grain alignment we find based on polarimetry of background stars shining through the outflows discussed below .",
    "however , not all alternatives to the davis - greenstein mechanism align the grains in this manner . with the caveat that other alignment mechanisms may play a role in massive yso outflows , in this paper we will assume magnetic grain alignment by some modified version of the davis - greenstein mechanism @xcite , where the direction of the polarization vector for light in extinction corresponds to the magnetic field direction .",
    "g192.16 has been extensively studied in co @xcite , other molecules @xcite , maser emission @xcite , and near - ir imaging @xcite .",
    "molecular line maps show a single a bipolar outflow from a young star , most likely unconfused with other outflows , extending @xmath20 to the east and west at a position angle close to @xmath21 .",
    "there is an infrared reflection nebula that coincides with the molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "the outflow is centered on iras 05553 + 1631 , which is coincident with a cm- and mm- continuum source @xcite .",
    "the radio continuum fluxes are consistent with an early b star at a distance of 2 kpc @xcite .",
    "high angular resolution cm- and mm- continuum observations show evidence for a solar system size accretion disk surrounding the exiting star @xcite .",
    "g192.16 has a very long bipolar outflow , about 3 pc , with herbig - haro objects extending up to 10 pc from the star @xcite .    our @xmath22-band image of g192.16 core and portions of the outflow to the east and west",
    "is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the @xmath22-band polarization vectors of six stars located along the line of sight are shown in the top panel of fig .  1 .",
    "the coordinates and polarization of these stars are listed in table 2 .",

    "the polarization of stars seen toward g192.16 on the sky is shown in the larger context of the surrounding ism in fig .  2 , where we include two stars ( # 7 and # 8) well off the outflow axis to the south ( also listed in table 2 ) .",
    "these two stars have polarization vectors closely aligned with the galactic plane at a position angle of @xmath23 . for the distance and direction of g192.16",
    ", we are looking largely across spiral arms in the milky way and would expect the magnetic field to lie predominately in the plane ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "examination of this region of the sky in the large data base of optical polarimetry of stars compiled by @xcite also shows the interstellar polarization vectors lie in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "thus , g192.16 is embedded in a large - scale magnetic field aligned with the galactic plane .",
    "the outflow axis of g192.16 is not aligned with the surrounding magnetic field , but is oriented at a significant angle of @xmath24 to the galactic plane .    with one exception ( # 3 ) , polarization vectors for the six stars in the same region of the sky as the outflow",
    "are not aligned with the interstellar magnetic field .",
    "this strongly suggests the interstellar polarization of these stars is influenced by dust associated with g192.16 .",
    "stars # 1 and # 6 are @xmath25 ne and sw of the core respectively and have polarization vectors pointing radially away from the central source .",
    "these stars are likely sampling the magnetic field geometry in the outflow , indicating that at a projected distance of 0.6 pc from the embedded yso the magnetic field is largely radial , as was the case for dr21 . however , within a projected distance of a few tenths of a parsec , the polarization vectors are more chaotic .",
    "star # 3 is aligned with the local ism and may be a foreground object , but the other three stars show no simple pattern of polarization position angles . unlike the dr21 outflow , where the observations were consistent with a purely radial field geometry everywhere in the outflow , the magnetic field geometry close to the exciting star in g192.16 must be more complex .",
    "deep , high resolution imaging of the region surrounding the yso at 2.1  @xmath26 m has been reported by @xcite .",
    "they find a faint 2  @xmath26 m source about @xmath27 east of the radio and mm continuum source .",
    "the @xmath22-band flux from this source shows little evidence for br@xmath28 or shocked molecular hydrogen emission .",
    "the source is essentially undetected at @xmath3 , indicating it is very red .",
    "@xcite speculate that this source is either directly viewed photospheric emission from the central star or a bright knot of diffuse emission associated with the accretion disk .",
    "below we examine the imaging polarimetry of this source and try and determine its true nature .",
    "@xmath22-band polarimetry of the reflection nebulosity associated with the g192.16 outflow is illustrated in the bottom panel of fig .  1 and listed in table 3 .",
    "these measurements were made using a synthetic @xmath29 aperture with our @xmath30 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 images .",
    "all of the polarization vectors are consistent with simple scattering of light from a central illuminating source close to the location of the cm- and mm- continuum source . in fig .",
    "3 we examine the region of bright nebulosity close to the illuminating source in more detail .",
    "the upper left - hand panel in fig .",
    "3 shows a grey scale image of the inner region .",
    "here we see a bright patch of reflection nebulosity and a fainter source , indicated by the cross lines , about @xmath31 west of the bright peak .",
    "this fainter source is the source discovered by @xcite who had significantly better seeing ( 0.6 ) than in our image ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "based on our astrometry using poss stars in the vicinity of g192.16 , the faint source is located at ra = @xmath33 , decl . = @xmath34 j(2000 ) , in excellent agreement with @xcite .    using a @xmath35 synthetic aperture we made polarization measurements of the nebulosity shown in fig .",
    "the results of these measurements , uncorrected for seeing effects , are shown in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "the source discovered by @xcite is highly polarized , and is very likely reflection nebulosity , not the central star itself .",
    "because of seeing effects , flux from the brighter patch of nebulosity can contaminate the polarized intensity we measure for nearby regions .",
    "we can roughly subtract this contamination from patches nearby the bright source by using the point spread function of nearby stars to estimate the amount of flux underlying the patch of sky we are trying to measure .",
    "for the faint source , contamination from the bright patch was about 30% of the total intensity .",
    "when the correction is made to @xmath30 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 , we obtain the polarization vectors in the lower right panel of fig .  3 .",
    "these vectors point back to an illuminating source that is @xmath36 west of the suspected stellar source . within our estimated position error of @xmath37 ,",
    "this is also the location of the compact continuum source .",
    "we conclude that the massive yso responsible for the molecular outflow and the illumination of the nebulosity in g192.16 is coincident with the cm- and mm- continuum source and is not visible at @xmath22 .",
    "our images are sufficiently deep to put new constraints on the extinction in front of the central star . in areas of our images well away from bright nebulosity , our 3  @xmath38 detection limit is about @xmath39 . near the position of the exciting star ,",
    "however , we are limited to about @xmath40 due to the bright underlying nebulosity .",
    "we estimate the central star must be fainter than this limit . using the expected value for the apparent @xmath22 magnitude of a b2 star at 2 kpc suggested by @xcite of @xmath41 , we derive @xmath42 . using the extinction law from @xcite",
    ", this corresponds to greater than 65 magnitudes of extinction at v. the infrared color for this amount of extinction is @xmath43 , placing the @xmath44 band brightness of this star well out of reach of our observations .",

    "the @xmath54 color of the two brightest blobs is @xmath55 , redder than any of the surrounding stars ( fig .  4 in * ?",
    "since reflection nebulosity can be intrinsically much bluer than @xmath56 ( depending on the spectral energy distribution of the illuminating star ) , our measured color translates to a visual extinction of @xmath57 .",
    "the illuminating star is presumably behind additional dust associated with an equatorial accretion disk , explaining why it is not visible at @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite argue that we see the association and its primary o star on the front side of a dense , molecular cloud .",
    "the newly discovered bipolar nebula is clearly deeper into this denser region than the cluster , indicating ongoing star formation just behind the interface between the hii region and the molecular cloud .",

    "we are presented with a picture of a very uniform magnetic field geometry threading through the entire cluster , and linking up smoothly with the field in the surrounding diffuse ism .",
    "the newly discovered bipolar nebula has a long axis aligned in the same direction as the threaded magnetic field , indicating that the polar axis of the illuminating star is also aligned with the local magnetic field .",

    "note that both the axis of the elongated radio emission in hw7 and the polarization vector for star 5 point directly back to hw3 . it may be that hw3 has brightened at near - ir wavelengths since the observations of @xcite and is now contributing more to the reflection nebulosity .",
    "the polarization vectors strongly depart from simple centro - symmetric scattering along a band stretching across hw2 from the se to the nw at a position angle of @xmath83 .",
    "this morphology corresponds well in position angle to the smaller fluffy torus described in @xcite and the rotating gas described by @xcite .",

    "we are probably looking through an optically thick disk of material extending at least @xmath84 ( 0.05 pc ) to the nw and se of the central cluster of b stars .",
    "light passing through this region will be scattered at least twice and loose the simple centro - symmetric polarization pattern produced by single scattering .",
    "based on all of the available observations of interstellar polarization toward cepheus a , we propose the schematic picture of the magnetic field geometry within and in front of ceph a shown in figure 10 .",
    "the foreground ( and possibly background ) magnetic field is closely aligned with the galactic plane at a pa of @xmath85 .",
    "the field threading the overall star forming complex is at a very different orientation of @xmath86 . at the far - ir / sub - mm peak ,",
    "essentially at the location of hw2 and hw3 , the magnetic field is roughly perpendicular to the outflow at @xmath87 .",
    "we say roughly , because there are probably multiple outflows and the reflection nebulosity presents a very broad fan - like structure on the sky .",
    "note , however , that the field direction at the far - ir / sub - mm peak is perpendicular to the outflow axis in the model proposed by @xcite",
    ". finally , the interstellar polarization to the east of the core cluster , as measured by hodapp and ourselves , shows the magnetic field well out in the outflow is radial .",
    "we have made imaging polarization observations of three regions of massive star formation at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "these observations allowed us to measure the interstellar polarization of stars along the line of sight to these regions and to measure the polarization of reflection nebulosity associated with embedded ysos .",
    "both g192 and ceph a are well known bipolar molecular outflow sources with well identified obscured massive ysos driving the flows and illuminating the reflection nebulosity . in w42",
    "we have discovered a previously unknown bipolar nebula and identified a probable location for the central star responsible for the observed reflection nebulosity .",
    "the reflection nebulosity in g192.16 was bright enough in several locations for us to measure the polarization due to scattering of light from the central yso by dust in the outflow .",
    "the observed polarization is entirely consistent with illumination by a single stellar source .",
    "this position of this object is coincident with the well studied point - like cm- and mm- continuum source previously identified as the illuminating yso .",
    "the yso is undetected in our maps at @xmath1 down to @xmath88 .    in ceph",
    "a , the polarization map of the reflection nebulosity shows evidence for more than one source of illumination in addition to hw2 , possibly hw3 .",
    "neither of these sources are detected at @xmath1 in our maps .",
    "the polarization in the reflection nebulosity close to hw2 and stretching from hw2 for several arcseconds perpendicular to the outflow shows clear evidence of multiple scattering .",
    "this region probably contains the outer extremes of a large accretion disk surrounding hw2 .      in w42 and",
    "ceph a , the main axis of the outflow and the local magnetic field are within 15@xmath7 of the galactic plane . in g192.16 , the main axis of the outflow and the magnetic field in the outflow are misaligned by at least 60@xmath7 with respect to the galactic plane . in w42 the magnetic field threading the hii region is well aligned with the galactic plane , and shows no evidence for additional components to the magnetic field geometry . the magnetic field geometry within ceph a is complicated , but we believe the field threading the complex is not aligned with the galactic plane , even though the outflow axis may be . in g192.16 , the magnetic field geometry threading the compact hii region could not be determined .    in all three regions ,",
    "the local magnetic field is aligned with the direction of the outflow at distances of several tenths of a parsec and further from the central source . in g192.16 the magnetic field geometry closer than a few tenths of a parsec to the central source",
    "is probably chaotic , and does not exhibit a radial geometry . in ceph",
    "a , we have no observations of the magnetic field geometry within @xmath89 of the exciting star(s ) , but sub - mm observations indicate the field at the location of the embedded yso(s ) is perpendicular to the outflow axis . in w42 , the newly discovered bipolar nebula is too small in angular extent on the sky for our technique to be able explore the embedded magnetic field geometry .",
    "the axis of the nebula is , however , exactly aligned with the magnetic field in the hii region and the galactic plane .",
    "the magnetically driven model for yso outflows predicts a spiral magnetic field in the core of the outflow along the outflow axis .",
    "our observations do not rule this model out if the field is a tight spiral only at small distances of less than @xmath2  pc from the star . at greater distances , our observations are consistent with a purely radial field .",
    "the tendency for the magnetic field at the location of the embedded yso(s ) ( measured by sub - mm polarimetry ) to lie perpendicular to the flow is probably due to a toroidal field in the extended equatorial disk , not in the outflow itself ( see the various model geometries discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "neither our technique of measuring interstellar polarization of background stars nor sub - mm polarimetry with large beam sizes will be able to probe the magnetic field geometry in the outflow close to , but separated from , the embedded star and its accretion disk .",
    "high spatial resolution far - ir and mm- polarimetry will be necessary .",
