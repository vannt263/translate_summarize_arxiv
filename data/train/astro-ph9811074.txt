    "the discovery of broad emission lines in the polarized spectrum of a number of seyfert 2 galaxies , has provided the first observational evidence in favour of the unified model which states that the main discriminating parameter between the two seyfert ( sey ) types is the inclination of our line of sight with respect to an obscuring torus surrounding the nucleus ( see antonucci 1993 for a review ) .",
    "x - ray data have subsequently reinforced this idea by demonstrating that type 2 objects are generally characterized by strong absorption , corresponding to column densities n@xmath1 @xmath4 10@xmath6 @xmath2 ( smith @xmath7 done 1996 , turner et al .",
    "1997a , maiolino et al . 1998 ) .",
    "x - ray measurements of the column densities in sey2s proved to be important in our understanding the nature of the absorbing medium , the validity of the unifying theory and also the relevance of type 2 objects to the synthesis of the x - ray background .",
    "+ the intrinsic absorption also defines the source characteristics : for n@xmath1@xmath8 10@xmath5 @xmath2 , x - rays above a few kev can penetrate the torus making the source nucleus visible to the observer and the column density measurable ; in this case the source is called `` compton thin '' . for values of n@xmath1 around a few 10@xmath5  @xmath2 , only x - rays in the 10 - 100 kev range pass through the torus and so only data in this band allow an estimate of the source column density . for values of n@xmath1",
    "higher than 10@xmath9  @xmath2 , also x - rays above a few tens of kev are absorbed ( as photons , after a few scattering , are redshifted down to the photo - absorption regime ) and the nucleus is totally hidden to our view ; in these sources only emission reflected by the torus ( cold reflected component ) or scattered by warm material near the nucleus ( warm scattered component ) is observed . in this case , the photoelectric cut - off ( if any ) in the observed spectrum does not provide information on the real column density absorbing the primary x - ray source and so the galaxy may be erroneously classified as a low absorption object ; therefore , for n@xmath1 @xmath10 10@xmath5 @xmath2 , the x - ray data can only provide a lower limit to the value of the column density .",
    "these so called `` compton thick '' sources are extremely faint in x - rays and therefore until recently only a few were known ( matt 1997 ) .",
    "the improvement in sensitivity of current x - ray telescopes has allowed few more sources of this type to be discovered ( turner et al .",
    "1997b , maiolino et al . 1998 ) .",
    "evidence for the presence of obscuring material can also be obtained via x - ray spectroscopy as iron line emission is expected to be produced either via transmission through ( leahy @xmath7 creighton 1993 ) or scattering / reflection by ( ghisellini et al .",
    "1994 , matt et al .",
    "1996a ) the absorbing material . in most compton thin cases the observed equivalent widths ( ew ) are of the order of a few hundred ev , consistent with the typical spectra of sey1s transmitted through the observed column densities ( turner et al . 1998 ) . when the column density increases to a few 10@xmath11 @xmath2 , the line ew increases as it is measured against a depressed continuum ; the ew can be higher than 1 kev for column densities @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath2 and such values are indeed observed in highly absorbed objects and compton thick sources ( matt 1997 , maiolino et al .",
    "although it is tempting to identify all sources with high equivalent width as compton thick systems , such condition can also occur if the ionizing radiation is anisotropic ( ghisellini et al 1991 ) , or if there is a lag between a drop in the continuum and in the line emission as indeed observed in ngc2992 by weaver et al .",
    "therefore when looking for compton thick candidates , it is important to take other evidence into consideration .",
    "measuring the x - ray luminosity against an isotropic indicator of the intrinsic brightness of the source offers an alternative method for evaluating n@xmath1 : assuming that the unifying theory is correct , the x - ray flux is depressed with respect to this isotropic indicator by an amount related to the absorbing column density .",
    "many authors have used the [ oiii]@xmath125007 and far - infrared ( hereafter [ oiii ] and fir respectively ) luminosities as isotropic indicators of the source nuclear strength , without however considering their limitations : the [ oiii ] flux may be affected by large scale obscuration in the host galaxy ( maiolino @xmath7 rieke 1995 , he s et al .",
    "1993 ) , while the fir flux may be contaminated by a starburst component ( maiolino et al .",
    "1995 ) . while it is difficult to account for the starburst component , it is possible to correct the [ oiii ] emission for the extinction towards the narrow line region as deduced from the balmer decrement .",
    "studies performed in the past have found that the ratio between the 2 - 10 kev x - ray and [ oiii ] fluxes ( hereafter t or thickness parameter ) cover the range 1 - 100 for both type 1 and type 2 objects .",
    "this was taken as evidence that the torus column density is never high on average ( mulchaey et al .",
    "1994 , alonso - herrero et al . 1997 ) .",
    "however , these results were strongly biased for type 2 objects as it will become apparent in the following .",
    "as the x - ray band provides 3 ways to measure the absorption along the line of sight ( the photoelectric cutoff , the iron line ew and the thickness parameter t ) it is convenient to plot seyfert galaxies in this 3-dimensional parameter space .",
    "figure 1 is a plot of t versus ew for a large sample of sey2s , with the value of the column density derived from the photoelectric cutoff coded in the symbols as indicated . in the appendix , we present the database used for the present study .",
    "it consists of a sample of 73 objects for which `` good '' x - ray spectra were available in the literature ( see the appendix for details on the selection criterion ) .",
    "the spectral fit of the hard x - ray data of these sources were quite homogeneous : an absorbed power law and a gaussian to account for the fe line .",
    "[ oiii ] fluxes were also collected from the literature .",
    "particular care has been taken to correct the [ oiii ] fluxes for reddening affecting the narrow line region ; this correction is not negligible in several cases ( see appendix ) and provides a more meaningful estimate of the t parameter with respect to previous studies ( mulchaey et al .",
    "1994 , alonso - herrero et al .",
    "a few objects , although present in the tables of the appendix , have been discarded from the following analysis because of dubious data : f09104 + 4109 and cygnus a have x - ray data probably contaminated by intracluster emission while for ngc5128 it is difficult to estimate both the [ oiii ] flux ( see appendix ) and the nuclear x - ray flux ( turner et al . 1997c ) . in three cases ( ngc3031/m81 , ng6251 and iras20210 + 1121 ) a 6.7 kev line is the only iron k@xmath13 line detected and so its ew is plotted in the figure .",
    "an immediate result of figure 1 is a t distribution quite different from previous reports ; in particular t can be @xmath14 1 , in a significant fraction of sey2s whereas all well studied sey1s have t@xmath4 1 ( maiolino et al . 1998 ) .",
    "since the sample used in building up this diagnostic diagram is highly heterogeneous , the relative populations of the various portions of it may not correspond to the real distribution .",
    "however the general shape of the diagram , which appears to be qualitatively in agreement with the unified theory and with the assumption that the dereddened [ oiii ] flux is an isotropic indicator of the intrinsic luminosity of the sey nucleus , is meaningful and translates into quantitative terms the relations between the 3 absorption indicators which were sketched qualitatively in the introduction .",
    "the relationship shown in figure 1 can be used to confirm already known compton thick sources and to suggest new candidates ; in particular , sources where the flux is too weak for spectral fitting and t is known to be @xmath8 0.1 are likely to be highly absorbed objects ( i.e. with n@xmath1 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath2 ) .    in figure 1 , 14 likely compton thick sources are shown ( see also table 2 of the appendix ) .",
    "these have a square around the symbol corresponding to the n@xmath1 value .",
    "most of them have already been proposed as compton thick sources in the literature ( see for example matt ( 1997 ) for ngc1068 , circinus galaxy and ngc6240 , malaguti et al.(1998 ) for ngc7674 , ueno et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for f20210 + 1121 and maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for ngc1386 , ngc2273 , ngc3393 and ngc5643 ) and we confirm this classification on the basis of our diagram .",
    "note that since for the sources discussed by maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) the x - ray parameters are deduced from a simple model ( see appendix ) , ngc4939 is classified here as compton thin although its nature is still uncertain .    .",
    "[ ]    the same diagram suggests five new compton thick candidates : ngc5135 , ngc4968 ngc1667 , mkn1210 and mkn477 .",
    "the cases of ngc5135 and ngc4968 were considered inconclusive by turner et al .",
    "( 1997b ) because of the large uncertainty on the line ew .",
    "however the low value of t for both of them , almost two orders of magnitude lower than the average in sey1s , and the small measured column density , consistent with being entirely due to galactic absorption , make them very likely compton thick candidates .",
    "the same considerations apply to ngc1667 whose classification was also considered uncertain by turner et al .",
    "note , however , that an alternative interpretation for the location of this source in the diagnostic diagram is possible ( see discussion below ) .",
    "mkn1210 and mkn477 can also be considered as compton thick objects according to our diagnostic diagram , although their nature is less well defined than in previous cases . in particular , the ew is lower than expected in mkn477 but both the low t value and the observed flat x - ray spectrum , typical of reflection dominated sources , are consistent with our suggestion . on the other hand , the compton thick nature of three other sources discussed by turner et al .",
    "( 1997b ) , namely mkn 273 , mkn463 and ngc2992 is still questionable according to figure 1 . in mkn 273 and mkn463 ,",
    "the 6.4 kev line ew is smaller than @xmath15 600 kev and compatible with the observed column densities while the not so low values of t , 0.7 and 0.3 respectively , are consistent with sey1 values if a correction for absorption is applied to the x - ray flux .",
    "different is the case of ngc2992 : weaver et al .",
    "( 1996 ) studied this source and reported a systematic decrease in the 2 - 10 kev luminosity by a factor of @xmath1516 over the last 20 years , while the iron line flux decreased only by a factor 2 - 3 and the reflection component became 5 times stronger .",
    "these authors interpreted the data in terms of a lag between reprocessed and intrinsic fluxes and accordingly located the reprocessor at the torus .",
    "we rephrase their statement and suggest that when an active nucleus fades away it moves along the diagnostic diagram at a constant column density , in a way which depends on the geometry and physics of the reflecting material . the temporal `` evolution '' of ngc2992 in our diagnostic diagram",
    "is shown in figure 2 , based on data in table 1 - 2 of the appendix and past data ( weaver et al .",
    "another object similar to ngc2992 is ngc1808 , which declined significantly in flux from ginga to asca observation ( polletta et al .",
    "1996 , turner et al .",
    "1997a ) , thus moving in the diagram towards the region of high ew and low t values ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that , at a certain stage of their fading process , these `` dying '' objects can be easily mistaken for compton thick sources .",
    "this ambiguity is for example present in the case of ngc1667 ( also displayed in figure 2 ) , which historically has varied by a factor of 150 in the 2 - 10 kev band ( polletta et al .",
    "1996 , turner et al .",
    "1997a ) moving in t from 1.5 to 0.01 ; only future observations will be able to assess the correct interpretation for this object .",
    "for the time being , we consider ngc1667 as a likely compton thick candidate also in view of the significant uncertainties associated with the ginga observation ( smith and done 1996 ) .",
    "a 3d plot like figure 1 for a sample with known selection and completeness properties would provide statistically significant information on the true distribution of absorption column densities .",
    "such an information would be extremely valuable for constraining the geometric parameters of the torus .",
    "the available sample is not statistically valid , nevertheless it provides some bounds to this true distribution .",
    "figure 3 ( upper panel ) reports the distribution of column densities for all sources in our sample excluding objects with upper limits on n@xmath1 , but including mcg-05 - 18 - 002 , which has been classified as a compton thick source by maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) simply on the basis of its low t value .",
    "sources identified as compton thick , i.e. with n@xmath1 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath2 are indicated by a shaded area in the histogram ; in particular since only data above 10 kev can rule out an absorbing column density in the range 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath9 cm @xmath16 , compton thick sources for which these data are lacking are placed at n@xmath1 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath2 , while the others are placed at n@xmath1 @xmath4 10@xmath9 @xmath2 .",
    "the most remarkable result of our analysis is the discovery of a large population of highly absorbed sources : more than half of the sample has n@xmath1",
    "@xmath4 10@xmath11 @xmath2 , with 25@xmath3 of the sources having n@xmath1 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath2 .    in order to proceed beyond this statement",
    ", we have considered the intersection between our x - ray sample and the sample of sey2s defined by maiolino @xmath7 rieke ( 1995 ) .",
    "the latter is an optical spectroscopic sample drawn from the rsa catalog of galaxies , which in turn is magnitude limited with respect to the host galaxy .",
    "according to the extensive discussion presented by the authors , the maiolino @xmath7 rieke sample of local active nuclei is much less affected by orientation and luminosity biases than any other similar sample . out of the 71 sey2s contained in maiolino @xmath7 rieke ( 1995 ) , 36 are in our database and their column density histogram",
    "is also shown in figure 3 ( lower panel ) .",
    "for this sample @xmath15 64@xmath3 of the objects has n@xmath1@xmath4 10@xmath11 @xmath2 ( even more if intermediate types are excluded ) while the 28@xmath3 with n@xmath1@xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath2 correspond to compton thick or nearly compton thick objects .",
    "the distribution has a mean log n@xmath1/@xmath2 of @xmath15 23.5 , significantly higher than what determined in the past .",
    "we have also considered the intersection of our database and the extended 12 @xmath17 sample ( rush , malkan @xmath7 spinoglio 1993 ) , which is a flux limited sample of 893 galaxies selected according to infrared properties . in this case , 31 objects appear in our x - ray catalog ( irrespective of their classification in the 12 @xmath17 sample ) and their n@xmath1 distribution is similar to those reported in figure 2 : half of the sample ( 52@xmath3 ) has n@xmath1 @xmath4 10@xmath11 @xmath2 , with 23@xmath3 of the sources having n@xmath1",
    "@xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath2 .",
    "the results on both these sub - samples are in line with the finding of maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that the average obscuration of sey2s , selected solely on the basis of their [ oiii ] flux , is much higher than found previously .",
    "however , also the n@xmath1 distribution of these sub - samples may still be affected by biases . even if the optical / infrared selection is unbiased , the x - ray selection ( expecially for the exosat , ginga and the oldest asca data ) favors sources already detected in previous all - sky surveys and therefore x - ray bright and/or little absorbed .",
    "we can then conclude that the true n@xmath1 distribution is likely to be even more shifted towards high n@xmath1 values .",
    "an estimate of the effect of this residual bias ( hence an estimate of the `` true '' n@xmath1 distribution ) is presented in risaliti ( 1998 ) , who identifies the dominant bias in the various subsamples contributing to the x - ray database and extrapolates the partial n@xmath1 distributions to the entire maiolino @xmath7 rieke sample . at any rate ,",
    "the large fraction of heavily obscured sey2s that are beginning to be found may have important implications for the synthesis of the x - ray background and has to be taken in due account in future refinements of existing models ( see for example comastri et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "finally , note that a few sources in figure 3 have n@xmath1 values consistent with pure galactic absorption ( i.e @xmath15 a few 10@xmath18 @xmath2 ) ; they also have t values typical of sey1s .",
    "some of them ( m81 and ngc 5033 ) may be wrongly classified as sey2s and probably are intermediate type 1.5 objects ; also ngc4579 is probably a liner , so that the low n@xmath1 value is compatible with its classification ( see appendix ) . on the other hand , ngc7590 and ngc3147 are bona - fide sey2s in the optical and yet have negligible absorption .",
    "the low n@xmath1 could be reconciled with their sey2s nature only if they were compton thick , but this is not supported by their large t values ( 7 and 14 , respectively ) .",
    "also , ngc3147 has an iron line equivalent width of 500@xmath19 ev ( consistent with a high absorption ) , but no line is detected in ngc7590 .",
    "it is therefore tempting to conclude that there might be a few objects in which the sey2s appearence is intrinsic and not due to obscuration .",
    "if confirmed , this would revive the long standing idea of a population of sey2s ( the `` true sey2s '' ? ) which just miss their broad line region ( tran 1995 ) .",
    "obviously more sources of this type should be identified before confirming this hypothesis .",
    "we have presented a `` three dimensional '' diagnostic diagram in the x - ray band for a large sample of sey2s .",
    "the diagram shows the k@xmath0 iron line equivalent width as a function of both the n@xmath1 derived from the observed photoelectric cutoff and the 2 - 10 kev flux normalized to the [ oiii ] line flux ( the latter corrected for extinction in the narrow line region and assumed to be a true indicator of the source intrinsic luminosity ) .",
    "the source distribution in this 3-dimensional parameter space is in qualitative agreement with the unified model , suggesting that the optical thickness of the torus along the line of sight is the main parameter responsible for the source x - ray properties .",
    "the diagram is useful to calibrate n@xmath1 as a function of the flux ratio t : for faint sources this may be the only way to determine their compton thick nature .",
    "it is also useful to isolate and study peculiar objects like `` dying '' agns ( like ngc2992 ) and `` true '' sey2s ( like ngc7590 ) .",
    "finally , and most importantly , our results provide an estimate of the true n@xmath1 distribution for type 2 objects , which is an important input for the synthesis models of the x - ray background . from our sample",
    "we find a mean column density log n@xmath1/@xmath2 @xmath15 23.5 , significantly larger than what determined in the past .",
    "we also find a large fraction of heavily absorbed objects , including a high percentage of compton thick systems ; out of these , several are newly classified ones .    * acknowledgement * + m.d",

    "<S> we present and discuss a `` 3-dimensional '' diagnostic diagram for seyfert2 galaxies obtained by means of x - ray and [ oiii ] data on a large sample of objects ( reported in the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram shows the k@xmath0 iron line equivalent width as a function of both the column density derived from the photoelectric cutoff and the 2 - 10 kev flux normalized to the [ oiii ] optical line flux ( the latter corrected for extinction and assumed to be a true indicator of the source intrinsic luminosity ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the hard x - ray properties of type 2 objects depend on a single parameter , the absorbing column density along the line of sight , in accordance with the unified model . </S>",
    "<S> the diagram can be used to identify compton thick sources and to isolate and study peculiar objects . from this analysis </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained a column density distribution of seyfert 2 galaxies which is thought to be a good approximation of the real distribution . </S>",
    "<S> a large population of heavily absorbed objects is discovered , including many compton thick candidates . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that the mean log n@xmath1/ @xmath2 in type 2 seyferts is 23.5 and that as much as 23 - 30@xmath3 of sources have n@xmath1 @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath2 .    </S>",
