    "it has been known for about two decades that clusters of galaxies provide a uniquely powerful probe of fundamental cosmological parameters . as the most massive virialized objects in the universe , they form at the highest peaks in the primordial density field , and as a result , their abundance and spatial distribution are very sensitive to the underlying cosmology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "strong constraints have already been derived on the present day matter density @xmath9 , and the normalization of the dark matter power spectrum @xmath10 @xcite , using only dozens of clusters . in large future surveys , with tens of thousands of clusters ,",
    "high  precision constraints are expected to be available on dark energy parameters @xcite , including constraints on the evolution of the equation of state @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "plans are are currently being drafted for the first very large scale clusters surveys .",
    "these projects , such as the 4,000 degree@xmath12 south pole telescope that will find clusters through the sz effect ( hereafter spt ; ruhl et al .",
    "2003 ) , a proposed larger x - ray survey @xcite , or catalogs of clusters identified in wide weak  lensing surveys , such as lsst @xcite , promise to produce catalogs of many thousands of clusters , containing a rich resource of cosmological information .",
    "with such an increase in the data looming on the horizon , it is becoming increasingly important to understand the inherent systematics , and establish realistic expectations for potential cosmological constraints .",
    "several recent works , motivated by the above considerations , have focused on various aspects of extracting cosmological parameters from high  yield future surveys , such as the statistical constraints available on curvature @xmath13  @xcite , assessing the impact of sample variance  @xcite and other uncertainties  @xcite on parameter estimates , and controlling such uncertainties by utilizing information from the shape of the cluster mass function @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "recent studies have also elucidated the additional cosmological information available from the spatial distribution of galaxy clusters through a measurement of their three  dimensional power spectrum @xcite , utilizing both the intrinsic shape of the transfer function  @xcite and baryon features  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , recent work has focused on the systematic errors on cosmological parameters arising from the inherent uncertainties on the mass  observable relation .",
    "it has been shown that large forthcoming cluster surveys can be `` self  calibrating '' , in the sense that when the abundance and clustering properties of clusters are considered in tandem , tight constraints can be derived on cosmology even if the mass  observable relation has to be determined simultaneously from the same data @xcite . in these studies ,",
    "the mass  observable relation was assumed to be either unknown apriori , or to have a simple parametric form ( such as a power ",
    "law ) .    while these assumptions have been demonstrated to yield interesting constraints",
    ", one may argue that this approach is overly conservative .",
    "in particular , it is reasonable to expect that the structure of clusters , such as their mean density and temperature profiles , can be at least approximately computed from ab ",
    "initio models .",
    "the simplest , spherically symmetric , self  similar models contradict observations , such as the relation between x  ray flux ( @xmath15 ) and temperature ( @xmath16 ) , or the resolved profiles of low ",
    "mass clusters @xcite . however , motivated by the observations of @xcite , modified ",
    "entropy models of the intra  cluster medium ( icm ) , while still not correct in detail @xcite , have been successful at predicting the mass  observable scalings in temperature , luminosity , and sz effect , from first principles @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that our understanding of the physics determining the structure of clusters will be improved in the future by advances in both observations and numerical simulations .    in this paper , we study the utility of a partial understanding of the icm in improving cosmological constraints .",
    "we will show that using a  priori cluster structure models , it is possible to significantly improve cosmological constraints , relative to direct , phenomenological self ",
    "calibration of the mass  observable relation  even if the physical model has free parameters .",
    "furthermore , the combination of x - ray and sz datasets is particularly promising @xcite , and can more effectively break degeneracies , since the underlying models directly relate the sz decrement to the x  ray flux .",
    "the end result is significantly improved errors on the cosmology , using the same observational data set , in addition to a well constrained model of the icm .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : models ] , we describe our models of cluster structure and evolution in the presence of a preheating of the icm gas . in  [ sec : fiducial ] , we discuss our fiducial model , and demonstrate that it satisfies a number of existing observations . in  [ sec : selfcal ] , we contrast our physical models with a `` traditional '' conservative approach to self  calibration , in which the mass  observable relation is parametrized directly as a power  law . in  [ sec : surveys ] , we discuss and motivate the parameters of our mock cluster surveys , and , for comparison , discuss future measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies . in  [ sec : fisher ] , we briefly summarize the fisher matrix approach , as applied to cluster surveys and cmb anisotropies . in  [ sec : results ] , we present and critically discuss our results , by comparing the constraints obtained under self  calibration and under the assumption of physical cluster models .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : conclude ] , we summarize our main conclusions and the implications of this work .",
    "in this section , for completeness and specificity , we describe our models for the structure  density and temperature profiles  of galaxy clusters , in the presence or absence of excess entropy .",
    "our treatment assumes that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium in a dark matter ( dm ) potential , and it closely follows previous studies on cluster profiles and preheating .",
    "modified entropy models are physically motivated by the presence of a universal entropy floor .",
    "@xcite find that the entropy distribution of icm gas , as inferred from rosat observations of 25 galaxy clusters , is inconsistent with simple gravitational collapse , and suggest instead the presence of an entropy floor of @xmath17 kev cm@xmath12 .",
    "this excess entropy is itself potentially a relic of winds and outflows from galaxies that formed in the protocluster , and heated the icm at moderate redshift @xmath19 , prior to cluster collapse .",
    "they then argue that this results in the observed departure of real galaxy clusters from the expected self - similar scaling .",
    "however , it is plausible that only a fraction of this preheating entropy is injected at high redshift .",
    "some of the heat input may come from a combination of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and supernovae ( sn ) , over an extended period , rather than winds in a narrow redshift range .",
    "for this reason , it is useful to treat @xmath20 as a function of redshift , which can be parametrized , for example , by a power - law relation @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that clusters at a given redshift @xmath22 are spherically symmetric and in hydrostatic equilibrium , with an ideal gas icm consisting of a fully ionized h  he plasma with the cosmic helium mass fraction @xmath23 , and a mean molecular weight @xmath24 .",
    "the unmodified entropy distribution is constructed by assuming that the gas traces the dark matter ( dm ) , and that the total gas density is given by a fraction @xmath25 of the cosmological baryon density within the virialized cluster that remains in the icm .",
    "the dm and gas profile is assumed to follow the @xcite ( nfw ) form , as motivated by n - body simulations , with a fixed concentration parameter @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , together with physically motivated boundary conditions , allows us to calculate the pressure and temperature profiles , which , combined with the gas density , give the entropy distribution as a function of radius .",
    "this entropy distribution is then modified by adding a constant @xmath20 at all radii , and the hydrostatic equilibrium equations are re  integrated under the assumption that mass shells do not cross ( i.e. @xmath27 is conserved where @xmath28 is the total gas mass at that radius ) . the resulting modified density and temperature profiles",
    "have flat cores , and they can be used to predict cluster observables , such as the x  ray flux or sz decrement .",
    "the icm is assumed to trace the dm , which is well - described by an nfw profile of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a scale radius defined in terms of the concentration parameters @xmath31 and the virial radius , as in @xcite , by @xmath32 and @xmath33 in both cases @xmath34 is the virial overdensity relative to the critical density of the universe @xmath35 given as a fitting form for a flat universe by @xcite , extended to include a time - evolving dark energy : @xmath36\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the matter density of the universe as a function of redshift @xmath22 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 comes from the dark energy equation of state @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the gas is assumed to trace the dm distribution for a given cosmology with a constant gas fraction @xmath43 , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the mean baryon fraction of the universe .",
    "the corresponding icm pressure and temperature profiles are computed by integrating the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium and mass conservation for an ideal gas , @xmath46",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath50 is the mass of a proton , @xmath51 is the mean molecular weight , and @xmath52 is the gravitational acceleration including the self - gravity of the gas .",
    "once @xmath53 and @xmath54 are determined , the entropy profile @xmath55 is computed according to @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the total gas ] particle number density @xmath58 .",
    "the outer boundary condition is taken to be a pressure resisting the infall of baryonic matter at the virial radius ; @xmath59 , with @xmath60 the free  fall velocity at the virial radius as in @xcite .",
    "after the unmodified entropy distribution has been calculated , we follow @xcite , and increase it by a constant @xmath20 as @xmath61 where @xmath55 is the unmodified distribution and @xmath20 is a constant of order 100 kev cm@xmath12 , assumed here to evolve with redshift as @xmath62 .",
    "this mimics the preheating of the icm , whereby some mechanism had injected a fixed amount of entropy into the gas prior to its collapse at redshift @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we change variables and re  integrate the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium using the modified entropy distribution @xmath63 .",
    "the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium then reads @xmath64 where , casting the pressure and temperature in terms of @xmath65 and @xmath63 @xmath66^{3/5}.\\ ] ] and @xmath67    we use the same pressure matching boundary condition as before .",
    "this procedure results in modified profiles for @xmath65 , @xmath68 , and @xmath16 that can be used to make predictions for different bulk properties of the cluster , and to establish the expected mass  observable relations .      before considering the effects of entropy modification on the bulk properties of the icm , it is instructive to visualize its impact on the radial profiles of clusters of different masses .",
    "in particular , for reference , we examine the effects of entropy modifications with @xmath69 and @xmath70 kev cm@xmath12 as compared to the unmodified model on two clusters with @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively , at redshift @xmath73 , with our fiducial @xmath74cdm cosmology ( see definition below ) . the radial temperature , pressure , and gas density ( @xmath75 ) profiles",
    "are plotted in figure  [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "the overall impact of the entropy injection is to depress and flatten the core pressure and density .",
    "this results in a flattened inner gas density profile @xcite and an outer ( @xmath76 ) temperature profile @xcite , resembling the results of recent x - ray observations .",
    "it is important to note that the effects of preheating are more pronounced for a low mass cluster than for a high mass cluster , with the limit that at very high mass the entropy injection becomes unimportant .",
    "this is because the injection is a decreasing percentage of the unmodified entropy at a given radius as the cluster mass increases .      in order to judge the fitness of our model for use in later cosmological measurements ,",
    "we first need to confirm that it can reproduce the observed scalings for the @xmath77 and @xmath78 relations , given the right choices for the input parameters @xmath25 and @xmath20 .",
    "we recall that the x  ray luminosity scales approximately as @xmath79 , and define the luminosity weighted temperature as @xmath80 where the integrations ( as in all the following cases ) are performed over the entire volume of the cluster out to the virial radius @xmath81 .",
    "we then assume a fully ionized h  he plasma with a hydrogen mass fraction @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , and calculate the x  ray luminosity as @xmath85 here @xmath86 is the @xcite cooling function for a gas of metalicity @xmath87 for either the bolometric or the k - corrected soft x ",

    ".    inverse compton scattering by electrons in the hot icm manifests itself as a fractional change in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , which at frequencies less than @xmath89 ghz appears as a decrement @xcite .",
    "this effect , often referred to as the thermal sz effect , provides a useful probe of the electron pressure @xmath90 integrated along the line  of  sight ( assuming the electrons and gas are in thermal equilibrium ) , which complements the x  ray luminosity measurements .",
    "we calculate both the central and integrated sz flux according to the prescription in @xcite .",
    "the amplitude of the sz effect is encoded in the compton parameter , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the thompson cross section and @xmath93 is the electron pressure integrated along the line of sight @xmath94 . the central decrement @xmath95 , and the sz flux is @xmath96",

    "in this section , we discuss the parameter choices in our fiducial model .",
    "our aim is to demonstrate that our fiducial model is in rough agreement with a number of existing observations .",
    "the observations we are mainly interested in matching are the scaling relations between cluster mass and observables , such as @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 , where @xmath106 represents the mass within a spherical overdensity of @xmath107 .",

    "our fiducial cosmology is also consistent with other cluster count measurements using optical @xcite and x - ray selected samples @xcite .    finally , despite its rough success , we call attention to potentially interesting tension between our fiducial model predictions and observations",

    "likewise , figure [ fig : lognlogs ] shows that our model @xmath128 relation somewhat overpredicts the number of bright clusters . that the current cluster data reveals such tension highlights the potential of larger surveys in calibrating models of the icm simultaneously with cosmology . in the present paper , however , our goal is to explore a methodology , rather than a specific cluster model .",
    "we made use of the existing data only to guide us in choosing a reasonable set of fiducial parameters , and we postpone a more rigorous study of the viability of this model to future work .",

    "this is particularly true of the dark energy equation of state parameters @xmath209 and @xmath210 , which improve by a factor of @xmath211 in the x  ray and @xmath212 in the sz survey .",
    "the single parameter sensitivities  the diagonal elements of the fisher matrix  for @xmath209 and @xmath210 are comparable in both approaches ( physical or phenomenological model ) .",
    "we find that the degeneracy breaking in the physical model is due to better absolute sensitivity to @xmath213 .",
    "this is because changing @xmath213 while holding @xmath205 fixed ( and assuming a flat universe ) changes the mean universal baryon fraction .",
    "accordingly , the value of the observables for a cluster of fixed mass will vary with @xmath214 . as a result ,",
    "changes in @xmath213 manifest themselves strongly in the redshift distribution of cluster counts in a flux  limited survey , even at fixed @xmath205 , when the physical , rather than phenomenological model , is used to calculate the threshold mass .",
    "this difference should be robust , in the sense that any physical model of cluster structure is likely to predict @xmath213dependence of the x  ray flux and sz decrement ( over and above the @xmath213 dependence contained in the hubble parameter @xmath215 in the power ",
    "law relations in equations  [ eq : lx ] and [ eq : snu ] ) .",
    "while using the physical model significantly improves the degeneracy coefficients for cosmological parameters in both the x  ray and sz survey , it also removes the synergy between the two , and degrades the synergy coefficient for their combination .",
    "for example , @xmath216 for the phenomenological model , as compared to @xmath217 for the physical model .",
    "we illustrate this effect by showing the marginalized constraints in the @xmath218 plane in figure  [ fig : cosmo.only ] .",
    "the error ellipses shown for phenomenological model ( right panel ) are larger than for the physical model ( left panel ) , and they are also more complementary , with major axes pointing in different directions .",
    "the overall constraints on the cosmology are , however , are still better when the physical models are used .",
    "we next present constraints using 20 flux bins for both the x  ray and sz surveys in table  [ table:10bin0scat.cosmo ] .",
    "using multiple bins allows additional information to be extracted from the shape of the cluster mass function . as a result",
    ", the degeneracy coefficients for all parameters are substantially reduced in both surveys .",
    "in fact , all parameters become nearly non - degenerate , and the synergy coefficients in both surveys using either the phenomenological or physical model are close to @xmath219 therefore , these constraints reflect the individual parameter sensitivities of the surveys",
    ". these sensitivities are roughly equal in the two approaches for all parameters , with the exception of @xmath213 , to which the physical model is a factor of @xmath220 more sensitive .",
    "this is not surprising , since the cosmological dependence of the physical model reduces to that of the phenomenological model in the limit of @xmath221 , expect for the @xmath213 dependence .",
    "we therefore confirm our interpretation of constraints using 1 flux bin , and illustrates quantitatively the power of the model to resolve @xmath213 .",
    "this sensitivity , under more realistic assumptions , will help the physical model break more degeneracies than the phenomenological model .",
    "constraints for more realistic surveys , in which scatter in the mass - observable relation will degrade the information that can be extracted from the mass  function shape , are summarized in table  [ table:10bin10scat.cosmo ] .",
    "these use 20 flux bins in both the x  ray and sz , but also include a log  normal scatter as a free parameter .",
    "the scatter smears out the shape of the mass function , and increases the degeneracy coefficients for all parameters and in both surveys , to values comparable to those using a single flux bin and no scatter .",
    "overall , the constraints are within a factor of two of the 1bin , no  scatter case , indicating that scatter destroyed most of the information from the mass function shape .",
    "the phenomenological case still has higher overall degeneracy coefficients , which makes the x  ray and sz constraints more synergistic in combination . on the other hand , the absolute constraints for all parameters are better when the physical model is used .",
    "we also find that imposing priors on the scatter does not significantly improve constraints on the cosmology .",
    "this contrasts with the results of @xcite .",
    "they , however , use a fixed mass threshold . for a flux",
    "limited survey , constraints on the cosmology degrade when a log - normal scatter is introduced as a free parameter , not primarily because of degeneracies among the scatter and the cosmology , but rather because the scatter itself washes out the cosmological sensitivity of the mass  observable relation . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we consider constraints on the cosmology and scatter using a fixed mass threshold versus a fixed flux threshold , both with 1 bin .",
    "we find that when a fixed mass threshold is used , fixing the scatter improves cosmological constraints by a factor of 2 in most cases , and up a factor of 4 in some .",
    "however , when a fixed flux threshold is used , the improvement is typically no more than 30% .",
    "this implies that the mass  observable relation , which is flattened by the inclusion of scatter , is driving the constraints on the cosmology .    in summary ,",
    "for the idealized case when the cluster structure or mass  observable relation is assumed to have no uncertainty , we find that the physical model leads to better sensitivity to dark energy parameters in both the sz and x  ray surveys individually , and also in the case when the two surveys are combined .",
    "we find that this improvement arises because the physical model predicts an increased sensitivity of the observables to @xmath213 , which removes degeneracies between @xmath213 and dark energy parameters .",
    "interestingly , the degeneracies are improved so substantially in the individual surveys , that the combination of the two surveys is _ less _ synergistic than in the phenomenological case .      in this subsection , we present self  calibrated constraints , in which the parameters of the phenomenological or physical model , are assumed to be a  priori unknown .",
    "we will focus on the extent to which this degrades cosmological constraints .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that such a self - calibration approach can yield tight constraint not just on the cosmology , but also on the properties of the clusters themselves .    in table",
    "[ table:1bin0scat.cal ] , we show self  calibrated constraints in the simplest case of 1 flux bin with no scatter .",
    "the results show that the phenomenological model parameters are extremely degenerate with the cosmology , suggesting their ability to introduce changes in @xmath222 in ways that mimic the effects of changing the cosmology .",
    "this has been noted previously : for example , uncertainties in the normalization of the observed mass  temperature relation result in large uncertainties in the value of @xmath10 measurements @xcite when this value is inferred from the cluster temperature function .",
    "the severe degeneracies between cosmological and mass - observable relation parameters are manifest in the high values of the degeneracy parameters , especially for @xmath10 , with of @xmath223 and @xmath224 for the x  ray and sz surveys respectively . when the x  ray and sz surveys are combined , it is possible to break some of these degeneracies , but for @xmath10 , and for the dark energy parameters in particular , the synergy coefficients @xmath225 , indicating that uncertainty in the slope , normalization , or evolution of the mass  observable relations in the x  ray or sz can mimic the effects of variations in these cosmological parameters .",
    "the above contrasts sharply with the results we obtain using a physical model  as the bottom half of table  [ table:1bin0scat.cal ] shows , there is only minor degradation of the cosmological parameter constraints due to the uncertainties in @xmath25 , @xmath20 , and @xmath173 . in this case , the x  ray parameter degeneracies on average increase only by a factor of @xmath226 as compared to the case of perfect knowledge of the model parameters , while the sz degeneracies increase by no more than @xmath227 .",
    "this demonstrates that the physical model parameters @xmath25 , @xmath20 , and @xmath173 do not easily mimic the effects of a change in cosmology .",
    "the comparison with the phenomenological model is especially dramatic for the dark energy equation of state parameters in the sz survey , whose constraints are improved by a factor of @xmath228 . in addition , because these parameters simultaneously determine both the x  ray and sz mass - observable relations , and because they enter into the expressions for the flux differently ( through @xmath229 for the x  ray and @xmath68 for the sz flux ) , the two surveys are more complementary than in the case when these parameters are fixed",
    ". therefore , the synergy coefficients are smaller than their analogues in table  [ table:1bin0scat.cosmo ] .    in table",
    "[ table:10bin0scat.cal ] , we extract information from the shape of the mass function , by using 20 flux bins , while still assuming no scatter in the mass  observable relation . as before , we find that the shape of the mass function helps to break many of the parameter degeneracies , with @xmath230 for all parameters , and thus these constraints again are indicative of the single parameter sensitivities . in the middle and the bottom set of rows in this table ,",
    "we consider two different parametrizations of the entropy injection history in the physical model : power  law , and arbitrary evolution of @xmath20 with redshift . in both cases ,",
    "the degeneracy coefficients for all parameters are significantly lower than those in the direct self  calibration models .",
    "they are somewhat higher for arbitrary @xmath20evolution by a factor of @xmath231 , indicating that relaxing the assumption of a power  law evolution can better mimic the effects of dark energy . however , in this case of arbitrary @xmath20 evolution , the x  ray and sz constraints are more synergistic in combination .",
    "therefore , when both the x  ray and sz results are considered , the absolute parameter constraints are degraded by no more than @xmath232 even when @xmath20 can evolve arbitrarily with redshift .",
    "we also see , as in the previous section , far greater sensitivity to @xmath213 when using the physical rather than the phenomenological model .",
    "finally , the constraints in the most realistic among our mock surveys , which includes 20 flux bins and a log  normal scatter as a free parameter , is presented in table  [ table:10bin10scat.cal ] . as we found in the the cosmology  only constraints above , the uncertainty in",
    "the scatter increases the degeneracies for all parameters , in both surveys , and for both the phenomenological and physical model results . for the phenomenological model",
    ", we recover the complementarity of the two surveys",
    ". however , both cases of the physical model give smaller degeneracy coefficients and better absolute constraints for all parameters .",
    "in particular , using the physical model improves @xmath209 and @xmath210 constraints by a factor of @xmath233 relative to the phenomenological model .",
    "we also note that allowing arbitrary @xmath20evolution still does not significantly degrade constraints , even in the presence of uncertain scatter , relative to a power  law @xmath20evolution .",
    "interestingly , we find that this is because for a physical model with arbitrary @xmath20 evolution , the x  ray and sz surveys are exceptionally complementary . in particular , the synergy coefficient for the dark energy parameters @xmath234 , indicating that constraints improve by more than 30% ( over adding the constraints in quadrature ) when the x  ray and sz surveys are combined . this is illustrated visually in figure  [ fig : darkenergy ] , where we show marginalized constraints in the @xmath235 plane .",
    "the figure shows a significant reduction in the size of the error ellipse when the two surveys are combined . in particular",
    ", this reduction is much more significant in the physical model ( left panel ) than in the case of the phenomenological model ( right panel ) .",
    "finally , we contrast the constraints we find from the mock cluster surveys to measurement of cmb anisotropies ( by planck ) .",
    "the constraints and degeneracy coefficients we find for planck individually are listed in table  [ table : complementary ] .",
    "the table shows that the forecasts for the combined x ",
    "ray and sz cluster surveys , even when we allow for unknown scatter , and for arbitrary entropy  injection history , compares favorably with planck , including @xmath213 which is known to be measured to exquisite precision with the cmb .",
    "we also investigate the utility of cmb measurements in breaking the parameter degeneracies inherent in the x  ray and sz cluster surveys . constraints for the combination of planck with the x  ray and sz cluster surveys ( including 20 bins and uncertain scatter , as in table  [ table:10bin10scat.cal ] ) are listed in table  [ table:10bin10scat.cmb ] .",
    "the inclusion of the planck data adds substantial sensitivity to the individual parameters , which results in a significant increase in the degeneracy coefficients .",
    "we find that when planck data is assumed to be available , the combination of x  ray and sz data , using a phenomenological model , is not particularly synergistic .",
    "all the synergy coefficients @xmath236 , with constraints on the dark energy equation of state unimproved relative to adding the three individual experiment errors in quadrature .",
    "this implies that cmb observations resolve the degeneracies that were previously broken by the combination of x  ray and sz data .",
    "this is also the case for a physical model with power ",
    "law @xmath20 evolution .",
    "however , for arbitrary @xmath20 evolution , we still find significant improvement in constraints for the combination of x  ray and sz data , even in the presence of cmb data , with @xmath237 for all parameters , and @xmath238 for dark energy equation of state parameters .",
    "this degeneracy breaking is only slightly weaker than in the absence of cmb data . indeed , though the addition of planck data to the individual surveys yields noticeably improved constraints on dark energy , when is included in the combined surveys it helps little with the @xmath209 and @xmath210 constraints , since their marginalized uncertainties are dominated by the degeneracies that remain with the cluster model parameters ( rather than among cosmological parameters ) .",
    "while the above results are promising , one may worry that they rely on the specific choice for the underlying physical model .",
    "in particular , if real data is fit with the wrong model , the derived cosmological parameters may suffer from a bias larger than their uncertainty we inferred above .",
    "such potential biases could be directly quantified by creating mock data using various  true \" models , and obtaining the best - fit to these data using different , parameterized ,",
    " wrong \" models .",
    "the magnitude of the bias , in general , will depend strongly on the pair of models that are compared  and hence , ultimately , on which way the real data falls .",
    "a full exploration of these biases also requires going beyond the fisher matrix approach adopted here , and will be postponed to a future paper .",
    "nevertheless , one can use the fisher approach to quantify the impact of wrong model assumptions , by adding new degrees of freedom , representing uncertainties about the underlying physical model , and evaluating the degradation in the statistical errors .",
    "this degradation can be regarded as the systematic error arising from the choice of the wrong model , among a restriced set of possible models .",
    "specifically , here we allow the gas fraction to evolve as @xmath239 , and the entropy injection to vary with mass as @xmath240 and radius as @xmath241 . to maintain our rough agreement with observations ,",
    "the fiducial model is chosen to match that used for the previous analysis , with @xmath242 , and the three additional parameters included in our self  calibrated fisher forecasts for a power  law evolving entropy injection with 20 flux bins and a log  normal scatter .",
    "we then compute the constraints for cosmological parameters as before , to see the extended to which they are degraded by the addition of these new degrees of freedom .",
    "we find that in the x  ray survey , the cosmological parameter constraints degrade by about a factor of @xmath243 , while in the sz survey , the constraints degrade by no more than @xmath244 .",
    "this behavior is to be expected , as the x  ray luminosity scales as @xmath245 , as compared to the sz luminosity that scales as @xmath68 , and is therefore more sensitive to changes in the physical model .",
    "likewise , the model parameter constraints degrade by @xmath246 in both the x  ray and sz surveys . when both surveys are combined , the cosmological parameter constraints degrade by no more than @xmath247 ",
    "@xmath248 for the dark energy equation of state  while the model parameter constraints degrade by @xmath249 . at the same time , we are able to constrain @xmath250  the evolution of the gas fraction  to within 0.14 and 0.11 from the x  ray and sz surveys individually , and 0.06 from their combination ; roughly similar to constraints on the evolution of the entropy injection .",
    "likewise , we are able to constrain the values of the new parameters to within @xmath251 from the x  ray and sz surveys individually , and 0.01 from the combination .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the greatest impact of introducing additional flexibility to the model is to degrade theoretical constraints on the model parameters themselves .",
    "the cosmological constraints , particularly for the sz and combined surveys , are more robust to relaxing the model assumptions . using a model with three extra degrees of freedom , even in the case of the x  ray survey , which is particularly sensitive to the model behavior ,",
    "the theoretical constraints using a physical model are substantially better than those using a phenomenological fit .",
    "while these results are encouraging , a more complete treatment , allowing for a wider range of ( non  power  law ) models , would be necessary to estimate possible systematic errors .",
    "though these results above are promising , we here note some important reservations .",
    "firstly , the goal in our study is to motivate a methodology , rather than a specific cluster structure model .",
    "we believe that the improvement in the constraints in individual experiments arises because adopting a physical model introduces new cosmology sensitivity that is not present when the mass  observable relation is parametrized directly . for the preheated model we consider here ,",
    "the dominant effect is the new @xmath214sensitivity , which we expect to hold generically , regardless of the details of a cluster model . likewise",
    ", the improvement in the synergy between the sz and x  ray surveys arises because the physical model relates the x  ray flux and the sz decrement ( one can not be changed without changing the other ) .",
    "this , again , should be a generic feature of any model that directly models the icm gas distribution .",
    "a caveat to this last conclusion is that the model may have uncertainties , such as gas clumping or a strong radial dependence of the entropy injection @xmath252 , which will changed the x  ray flux relative to the sz decrement , which will tend to reduce the synergy between the two surveys .",
    "nevertheless , before fits to real data can be performed , there is significant work to be done in modeling cluster structure and evolution more accurately .",
    "modified entropy models , though very successful at predicting mass  observable relations and their evolution , are incorrect in detail @xcite .",
    "we also find some tension between our model predictions and observed local scaling relations and number counts ( see figures  [ fig : localscaling ] , and [ fig : lognlogs ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in addition to having models that fit cluster structure data accurately , one has to also know the correct cosmological dependence of the observables in these models . in the future",
    ", we envision that three  dimensional simulations , including the relevant non  gravitational and gas physics , at least in parametrized manner , and also including asymmetries in cluster structure , as well as deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium , will provide such models .",
    "in addition to an improved model of cluster structure , more realistic constraints require a detailed treatment of the systematics of any real survey .",
    "our work represents a  best case scenario \" , in which the x  ray and sz surveys are idealized in many ways . with the introduction of scatter , and using bin sizes far wider than any reasonable observational error on flux measurements , the inclusion of systematic uncertainties in flux measurements will not significantly change our overall results . on the other hand , completeness and selection issues will degrade final errors , and may effect the complementarity we have found .",
    "as large - scale cluster surveys start taking data , a more thorough understanding of the combination of the systematic and statistical uncertainties will be required to interpret our results .",
    "using a fisher matrix approach , we have demonstrated that the use of a physically motivated model of the icm in mock large - scale cluster surveys gives significantly better constraints on cosmological and model parameters , and better synergy between sz and x  ray surveys , than one can obtain by directly parametrizing the mass  observable relation . in particular , when both the cosmology and model parameters are included in the fit , for the simplest case of pure cluster counts as a function of redshift ( see table  [ table:1bin0scat.cal ] ) , the physical model yields constraints on the dark energy equation of state that are 2 times tighter and 3 times less degenerate in the x ",
    "ray , and 10 times tighter and 15 times less degenerate in the sz than those using a phenomenological model .",
    "if the shape of the mass function and scatter in the mass - observable relation are included and the entropy floor is taken to be an arbitrary function of redshift ( see table  [ table:10bin10scat.cal ] ) , the dark energy parameter constraints are 20% times tighter and 2 times less degenerate in the x  ray , and 2 times tighter and 2 times less degenerate in the sz than those using a phenomenological model .",
    "in addition , these constraints are up to a factor of two tighter than those from simply adding the individual experiment errors in quadrature , relative to a minor 20% improvement from combining constraints using a phenomenological model .",
    "these result suggest that parametrized physical models of cluster structure will be useful when extracting constraints on both cosmology , and cluster structure itself , from future large ",
    "scale sz and x  ray cluster surveys .",

    "<S> it has been shown that in an idealized galaxy cluster survey , containing @xmath0 clusters , statistical errors on dark energy and other cosmological parameters will be at the percent level . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , through `` self  calibration '' , parameters describing the mass  observable relation and cosmology can be simultaneously determined , though at a loss in accuracy by about an order of magnitude . here </S>",

    "<S> initio physical model is used to compute theoretical mass  observable relations from the cluster structure . as an example </S>",
    "<S> , we use a modified  entropy ( `` preheating '' ) model of the intracluster medium , with the history and magnitude of entropy injection as unknown input parameters . using a fisher matrix approach , </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the expected simultaneous statistical errors on cosmological and cluster model parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that compared to a phenomenological parametrization of the mass  observable relation , our physical model yields significantly tighter constraints in both surveys , and offers substantially improved synergy when the two surveys are combined . in a mock x  ray survey </S>",
    "<S> , we find statistical errors on the dark energy equation of state are a factor of two tighter than the phenomenological model , with @xmath1 and its evolution , @xmath2 , with corresponding errors of @xmath3 and @xmath4 from a mock sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) survey , both with @xmath5 clusters , while simultaneously constraining cluster model parameters to @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> when the two surveys are combined , the constraints tighten to @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; a 40% improvement over adding the individual experiment errors in quadrature , and a factor of 2 improvement over the phenomenological model . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that parametrized physical models of cluster structure will be useful when extracting cosmological constraints from sz and x  ray cluster surveys . </S>"
