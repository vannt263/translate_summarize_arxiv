    "these represent the impact points of the operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the transverse space . finally , the functions @xmath43 are the radial wave functions for the scattering states . for scalar operators @xmath44 of dimension @xmath45",
    "they are given by @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and by @xmath48 for @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "we normalize the wavefunctions so that @xmath50    as shown in @xcite , the impact parameter representation ( [ eq200 ] ) and ( [ eq300 ] ) approximates the conformal partial wave decomposition of the correlator ( [ eq100 ] ) in the channel @xmath51 , with intermediate states of conformal dimension and spin respectively given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",

    "this can be shown , as customary @xcite , by approximating the integral in ( [ eq400 ] ) at the saddle point @xmath100 .",

    "more precisely , the integral ( [ eq7200 ] ) has a leading behavior given by @xmath113 where we have defined the scaling variable@xmath114 on the other hand , we are interested in the analysis of the cross section @xmath115 deep inside saturation , that is for @xmath116 in this case , the integral ( [ eq1100 ] ) is dominated by the region @xmath117 , where we may replace @xmath118 .",
    "this situation corresponds to a simple black disk in ads ,  even though this is less transparent from the four dimensional perspective .",

    "note that , for @xmath121 equation ( [ eq2000 ] ) is dominated by the first term and we obtain @xmath122 to be contrasted with ( [ eq8000 ] ) , valid near saturation .",
    "finally note that , even in the deeply saturated region , the cross section @xmath115 grows with @xmath123 with a power law , violating the froissart bound .",
    "recall though that ( [ eq2000 ] ) has been derived by assuming an exact conformal symmetry and that , in a conformal theory , the froissart bound is not relevant since there is no mass scale .    for the sake of clarity , let us discuss a specific example , which is at the same time simple and instructive , since it contains most of the relevant physics .",
    "we will work with the maximally superconformal version of qcd , @xmath124 sym with @xmath125 gauge group , and we will consider the scalar operators @xmath126 and @xmath127 of dimension @xmath128 , with @xmath129 and @xmath130 two of the three complex adjoint scalars of the theory .",
    "to leading order in @xmath131 , we have the well known bfkl result @xcite@xmath132 and @xcite @xmath133 at vanishing @xmath134 , the integral ( [ eq400 ] ) can be explicitly computed to be @xmath135   ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in particular , we see that at @xmath107 we have @xmath136 , which for a typical value of @xmath137 is well below saturation . at @xmath107",

    "is reached for @xmath139 , with @xmath140 and @xmath141 the above are clearly leading order results . however , as we shall explain in more detail in the next section , the experimental value of @xmath142 in dis experiments is lower .",
    "for example , in the analysis of @xcite one finds @xmath143 , since the scaling variable @xmath144 has the form ( [ eq8100 ] ) with @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , as is well known , next to leading order corrections to the leading bfkl results ( which also distinguish between qcd and its supersymmetric extensions ) are important to match to experiment .",
    "we now explore the phenomenological consequences of our results on deeply saturated cross sections for dis in qcd at small bjorken @xmath0 . throughout the discussion",
    ", we shall assume that we are working in the conformal setting , thus neglecting the running of the coupling constant and all quark masses .",
    "we will associate the scalar operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively to the photon and proton . note that , deep into saturation , the spin of the external particles plays a minor role , since amplitudes are dominated by the black disk region with @xmath146 . as usual , @xmath9 is the photon virtuality and @xmath147 .",
    "moreover , the scale @xmath148 will now represent a phenomenological parameter , related to the proton wavefunction , of the order of the relevant proton scales .",
    "the wave functions @xmath149 and @xmath150 are localized respectively around @xmath151 and @xmath152 . therefore , the total cross section @xmath153 in ( [ eq600 ] ) can be approximately computed using the saturated cross section @xmath68 in ( [ eq5100 ] ) whenever @xmath154 moreover , for large @xmath155 , the saturation line @xmath156 is approximately linear and @xmath157 is given by the simple expression ( [ eq2000 ] ) . in this case , we may easily compute the radial integrals in ( [ eq600 ] ) since , on purely dimensional grounds , we must have that @xmath158 for some constants @xmath159 of order unity , and similarely for the proton wave functions .",
    "hence , in the deeply saturated regime at high @xmath155 , we expect a rather simple form for the total cross section @xmath160 .",
    "recalling that the cross section @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the usual dis proton structure function , we obtain that @xmath163   -\\tilde{c}~\\frac{q}{\\ \\tilde{\\lambda}}\\left [   \\frac{q}{\\tilde{\\lambda}}+\\frac{\\tilde{\\lambda}}{q}\\right ]   ~,\\label{magic}\\ ] ] where the constants @xmath164 and the scales @xmath165 are the only remenants of our lack of precise knowledge of the scattering radial wave functions .",
    "in particular , @xmath165 will be of the same order as @xmath148 .",
    "had we included the spin of the particles in the discussion , the parameters @xmath166 would carry also this kinematical information .",
    "the exponent @xmath142 is , on the other hand , universal and depends uniquely on the spin of the pomeron .",
    "note that , since @xmath167 , the constants of order unity coming from the first two terms of ( [ eq2000 ] ) are essentially identical , and we may safely take @xmath168 in first approximation .    as in ( [ eq2000 ] ) , when @xmath169 , the cross section @xmath60 is dominated by the first term in ( [ magic ] ) and exhibits the geometric scaling @xmath170 where we define the scaling variable @xmath144 as usual as @xcite @xmath171 recall that the power of @xmath172 in the saturation scale @xmath173 is observed experimentally , following @xcite , to be given by @xmath174 , so that @xmath175 deeply into saturation , we predict that @xmath60 evolves with @xmath144 with the specific exponent in ( [ eq8300 ] ) , which is _ uniquely _ fixed by the measurement of @xmath142 at the saturation scale @xmath173 .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the behavior of @xmath60 near saturation following from ( [ eq8000 ] ) , where the exponent of @xmath144 is _ not _ fixed uniquely by @xmath142 .     in @xcite , in the @xmath176@xmath177 plane , with energies measured in gev .",
    "all points lie above the line @xmath178 .",
    "shown is also the shaded region of points considered when analyzing ( [ magic ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to the region delimited by the vertical line , setting @xmath179 , the horizontal one , setting @xmath180 , and the asymptotic linear saturation line .",
    "this is shown with a thicker line and is obtained by offsetting the graph in figure [ lns - b ] by @xmath181 along the @xmath178 line .",

    "measurements have been performed at values of @xmath0 and @xmath9 shown in figure [ figdatapoints ] , as discussed in @xcite , which collects all available data from @xcite . in this figure",
    ", we present the data in the @xmath182@xmath183 plane , with all energy scales measured in @xmath184 from now on .",
    "these are the natural variables to discuss saturation , since they enter directly into ( [ eq9000 ] ) .",
    "we will fit the avaliable @xmath4 values using ( [ magic ] ) in its plausible region of validity .",
    "first of all , we will take @xmath185 with @xmath186 @xmath184 so that , in first approximation , the running of the coupling can be neglected .",
    "secondly , we wish to choose points inside the saturation line ( [ eq9000 ] ) .",
    "the exact determination of this line depends crucially on the phenomenological parameter @xmath148 , and in turn on the strongly coupled dynamics of the proton .",
    "we expect the value of @xmath148 to be in the range of available scales  i.e. the qcd scale and the proton mass .",
    "assuming that radial wave functions are localized around @xmath187 and @xmath152 , the saturation line in the @xmath182@xmath183 plane is then given by the saturation line for the ads phase @xmath67 shown in figure [ lns - b ] , where we replace @xmath12 and @xmath134 respectively by @xmath188 and @xmath189 .",
    "in practice , this ammounts to drawing the saturation line of figure [ lns - b ] onto figure [ figdatapoints ] , offsetting the origin along the line @xmath178 by @xmath190 . we shall then take points with @xmath191 thirdly , we wish to consider data points with high values of @xmath192 , so as to be into the linear regime of the saturation line .",
    "as explained in the previous section , the leading order bfkl  analysis suggests that the linear regime starts around @xmath193 , so that we shall take data with @xmath194    to proceed , let us choose @xmath195 @xmath184 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "we will show later that the main results are insensitive to this specific choice .",

    "we shall test our theoretical prediction against the real data in @xcite as well as against the very accurate neural network interpolation to world dis data in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we shall minimize the average square deviation of the data from the predicted theoretical form ( [ magic ] ) .",
    "since the parameters @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 enter linearly in ( [ magic ] ) , minimization reduces to a linear system parameterized by the single parameter @xmath142 .    .",
    "for comparison , both functions have been normalized to @xmath201 at their respective minima .",
    "the error for the simulated data exhibits a sharp minimum , while the corresponding error for real data is more insensitive to @xmath142 , due to a large experimental uncertainty .",

    "more precisely , at fixed @xmath204 , the coefficients @xmath198 and @xmath142 determine the slope as well as the convexity of the function @xmath203 in the experimental region of interest , shaded in figure [ figdatapoints ] .",
    "unfortunately , the relevant kinematics is on the boundary of the currently accessible experimental settings , resulting in data of relatively poor quality with large experimental uncertainty .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the error function , although it presents a minimum for @xmath205 , is essentially constant in the range @xmath206 to @xmath207 plotted in figure [ figerror ] . on the other hand , as shown in the same figure , if we use the more accurate simulated function @xmath203 computed at the same values of @xmath0 and @xmath208 available in the real data @xcite , we obtain a rather sharp minimum for the error function at @xmath209 therefore , from now on , we shall determine the optimal value of @xmath142 using the simulated data only .",
    "at this point we wish to emphasize that this value of @xmath142 , obtained from data inside the saturated kinematical region , is within the experimental range @xmath202 , obtained independently from geometric scaling .",

    "using the fact that @xmath279 for @xmath47 , we have just obtained the usual expression in terms of dipole wave functions @xcite .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us recall the form of the dipole ",
    "dipole cross section @xmath280 , in the unsaturated case ( [ eq7100 ] ) .",
    "it is given by the usual bfkl kernel@xmath281 which should be compared with ( [ eq7200 ] ) , with @xmath282 given by ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "recall also that the above expression is the zero momentum contribution to the full bfkl expression for @xmath283 given by @xcite @xmath284 where @xmath285 and where @xmath286 is the @xmath287dimensional conformal partial wave of spin @xmath288 and conformal dimension @xmath289 at the four points @xmath290 , @xmath291 . due to transverse conformal invariance , @xmath292 depends uniquely on the cross  ratio combinations@xmath293 and is given explicitly by @xmath294 where @xmath295 is the hypergeometric function @xmath296 .    the expression ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "should be confronted with @xmath297 derived from equations ( [ eq4000 ] ) and ( [ eq400 ] ) in the limit of small ads phase shift @xmath245 , @xmath298 given the similarity of the expressions for @xmath299 and @xmath300 , we may try to follow the program of section 2 and consider the saturation region in the transverse impact parameter @xmath34space where , at fixed energy @xmath123 and dipole orientations @xmath301 , the cross section @xmath302 becomes greater then unity .",
    "on the other hand , this program can not be carried out in general . in fact , while the cross section @xmath297 depends , aside from energy , on a single conformal cross ratio @xmath12 , the cross section @xmath302 depends on energy and on two cross ratios @xmath303 which reflect the orientations of the two dipoles ( the scalar quantities @xmath304 are replaced by the dipole transverse vectors @xmath305 ) . moreover ,",
    "both @xmath12 and @xmath306 enter exponentially in ( [ c1 ] ) and allow for a simple saddle approximation of the integral and for the determination of the saturation line as in ( [ eq1200 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependence of the integrand in ( [ eq1 ] ) on @xmath303 is now highly non  trivial , since it involves not only the norms but also the orientations of @xmath307 .",
    "most importantly , it does not allow for a simple approximation of the integral at a saddle point and a simple determination of the saturation line .",
    "the analysis of the saturation region for @xmath299 can be carried out only in the limit @xmath308 .",
    "in fact , in this limit , one may use the operator product expansion and obtain @xmath309 of the simple exponential form .",
    "similarly , in the same limit @xmath310 one has @xmath311 and one may substitute , in ( [ c1 ] ) @xmath312 obtaining an expression analogous to ( [ eq3 ] ) . from here on",
    "we may follow the usual steps reviewed in section 2 to determine the saturation radius , which is given in general by @xmath313 , leading to a black disk cross  section given by @xmath314 .    with this procedure",
    "we recover an expression analogous to the first term of ( [ eq2000 ] ) just as easily in the dipole formalism . on the other hand , as we already pointed out , the usual saddling argument works in ( [ c1 ] ) for generic values of @xmath315 .",
    "this fact allows to determine the other terms in equation ( [ eq2000 ] ) , which could not have been deduced in the dipole language . note that the extra three terms in ( [ eq2000 ] ) , and correspondingly in ( [ magic ] ) , are crucial in order to have a qualitatively good fit for the relevant @xmath4 data at hand .",
    "in fact , the expression for @xmath222 exhibits a non - trivial dependence on @xmath204 at fixed @xmath316 , which is qualitatively correctly captured by the third and fourth terms in ( [ magic ] ) proportional to @xmath317 these terms give a concave behavior with maximum at @xmath318 , which is a clear feature of the @xmath4 data , as can be seen from the plots in figures [ fit1 ] , [ fit2 ] , [ fit3 ] and [ fit4 ] . a pure term of the form @xmath319 , as could be determined by the above arguments also in the usual dipole formalism , is clearly insufficient to reproduce the @xmath204 dependence at fixed @xmath316 inside the saturation region .",
