    "the flavour structure of the standard model ( sm ) is , arguably , the best proof that there is new physics lurking above the electroweak scale . we do not know how this new physics should manifest itself , so one is forced to consider all possible ways to uncover it",
    "moreover , any experimental result that deviates from the sm expectation is bound to receive close scrutiny for new physics .",
    "apart from the direct production of new particles , one can look for their indirect effects , _ i.e. _ , how the operators at a high energy affect the low - energy observables . in this respect , the @xmath5 b factories at cornell , slac , and kek are doing a commendable job by churning out a huge amount of data on various b decay modes , including the branching ratios ( br ) and cp asymmetries .    even at this stage , there exist several hints that everything is not as one should expect from the sm , if we take the experiments seriously .",
    "the sm is in no way ruled out , since there is much scope for theoretical uncertainty in low - energy qcd , but it will be under considerable strain if the experimental results persist over the next few years . in a large set of data ,",
    "most of which are in perfect agreement with the sm , there are three so - called sore thumbs sticking out : ( i ) the direct and mixing - induced cp - asymmetries for the mode @xmath6 where belle and babar are not consistent @xcite , ( ii ) the abnormally high branching ratios for the @xmath7 and @xmath8 modes , incompatible with the sm prediction with factorization @xcite , and ( iii ) the measured value of @xmath9 from @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "channel @xcite .",
    "it is not clear at this moment whether this is a feature of qcd factorization models , which was used in the analysis , or is true in general . ]",
    "( last two points are closely related ; see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite . )",
    "let us briefly comment on these anomalies .",
    "but first we wish to make our notation clear : we use @xmath11 as a general shorthand for both @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and also for the charged @xmath11 mesons where the mention of charge is either unnecessary or self - evident , and the brs are assumed to be averaged over the cp conjugate states .",
    "moreover , we use the symbol @xmath14 to denote the final states with either an @xmath15 or @xmath16 and a @xmath17 or @xmath18 ( neutral or charged ) .",
    "the first anomaly exists only for belle  babar data is completely consistent with the sm expectation , if one uses perturbative qcd calculations @xcite or qcd - improved factorization model @xcite .",
    "however , if we take the belle data seriously , existence of new physics is hinted .",
    "a possible solution is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the second and third anomalies are the main theme of this paper . before one confronts the data with any specific model , three things are obvious .",
    "first , even if there is new physics , it is very much flavour - sensitive , since modes with the same topologies are not equally affected .",
    "secondly , the effect of new physics is of the order of unity , considering the change in the brs of @xmath19 modes , and the cp asymmetry from the @xmath2 mode .",
    "thus , the effective operators generated by the new physics should better be tree - level at the high scale , unless one prefers a strong - coupling theory .",
    "thirdly , the new physics amplitude should have weak ( and possibly strong ) phases different from the corresponding sm amplitude to generate the observable cp asymmetries , particularly in the @xmath2 channel @xcite .",
    "these constraints severely limit the choice of plausible new physics options .",
    "puzzle have been proposed @xcite . ] among those that survive , one of the most respectable options is r - parity violating supersymmetry ( rpv ) @xcite .",
    "rpv automatically generates flavour - specific tree - level operators which can leave their signals in some , but not all , b decay modes .",
    "the effect of rpv on b decays has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed as a solution to the @xmath2 cp asymmetry puzzle @xcite , and even a simultaneous solution to both the @xmath0 and @xmath20 anomalies has been proposed @xcite .    what is new , then , in this paper",
    "there are two main points where our analysis differs from @xcite .",
    "this is the first time that one takes all the relevant parameters , including the final - state strong phases , into account , and tries to explain all available data , including the direct cp asymmetry results .",
    "secondly , we have not looked at isolated points in the parameter space as possible solutions , but have made a complete scan over the whole parameter space , and find out the regions which satisfy all the existing data .",
    "in fact , we introduce only one new physics operator , which , we find , does the fitting quite well .",
    "moreover , we get a stronger bound on the relevant coupling , two orders of magnitude better than the existing one .",
    "the discrepancies from the sm expectations show up in the brs of different @xmath21 modes ( see our convention before ) , and the value of @xmath22 extracted from @xmath2 decay .",
    "the numerical values are given in section 2 . by itself ,",
    "the cp asymmetry data has nothing wrong in it , but it is definitely not consistent with the value of @xmath22 extracted from @xmath3 ( and other charmonium channels ) even at @xmath23 .    that the experimental numbers are not consistent with the sm predictions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 modes are known for a long time .",
    "many solutions for this are proposed , ranging from introducing a charm content of @xmath16 or anomalous @xmath16 coupling to gluons to the introduction of new physics like rpv @xcite . for our calculation",
    "we take the charm contents in both these mesons to be zero . to have an estimate of the sm brs for these modes",
    ", we assume naive factorization ( nf ) to hold good .",
    "note that the brs are more or less stable with the variation of the number of effective colors , @xmath24 , which takes into account the nonfactorizable effects @xcite .",
    "this , however , is not true for the generic @xmath25 modes , which is a penguin and the br depends sensitively on @xmath24 , falling quickly as @xmath24 increases .",
    "thus , if one takes a fixed value of @xmath24 , the br predictions ( within the context of the sm ) for the @xmath1 and @xmath0 modes are sort of reliable , but that is not the case for the @xmath26 mode .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that dynamical enhancement of the penguin operators may lead to a twofold increase of the br over the expectation from the nf model @xcite .",
    "keeping in mind such sensitivity which results from a numerical cancellation between different wilson coefficients ( wc ) , we think it prudent to present the analysis both by including br(@xmath27 as a constraint and by discarding it . we will show that the tighter constraints on the parameter space come from the cp asymmetry data and the @xmath19 brs , and relaxation of the @xmath28 br constraint does not affect the solutions in any perceptible way .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in the next section",
    "we enlist all our input parameters , relevant formulae and experimental data . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the rpv effective hamiltonian , and show how it affects the modes we are interested in .",
    "section 4 deals with the numerical results , and we display the allowed regions of the parameter space that satisfy all data . in section 5",
    "we summarize and conclude .",
    "we consider only those modes which are , even in the sm , governed by the @xmath29 transitions , with @xmath30 , @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",

    "note that babar uses a convention which differs by a minus sign from our convention of @xmath68 ( see eq .  ( 1 ) of @xcite ) , and the convention of belle differs by a minus sign too , in both direct and mixing - induced cp asymmetries .",
    "also note that if @xmath69 were a pure @xmath41 penguin , the mixing - induced cp asymmetry would have been @xmath22 ; but the presence of a tree - level @xmath70 term makes the calculation more complicated .",
    "that is why we have used the data from @xcite which gives directly the direct and mixing - induced cp asymmetries , rather than @xcite , which quotes an effective value of @xmath71 .    among these data ,",
    "the measured brs are definitely higher than the theoretical predictions ; the discrepancy is about a factor of 2 to 3 for the @xmath0 modes and almost a factor of 10 for the @xmath1 modes within the nf model ( this depends on the choice of the regularization scale , and the effective number of colors ) .",
    "the expressions for the amplitudes can be found in the appendix , and the numerical values of the theoretically expected brs in tables 8 and 10 , of @xcite . however , there are other models , as the perturbative qcd @xcite , which predict a dynamical enhancement of the penguin amplitude due to the higher - twist corrections . judging by the enhancement one may get in these models for charmless modes , one expects at most to gain a factor of 2 over the factorization amplitude .",
    "this , evidently , does not serve our purpose .",
    "let us just point out again that we take neither any charm content in @xmath15 or @xmath16 nor any anomalous @xmath72 coupling with gluon .",
    "the cp asymmetry data are consistent with the sm prediction ; if one assumes these decays to be penguin dominated as a first approximation , the direct cp asymmetry should be zero , whereas the mixing - induced cp asymmetry should be just @xmath22 .",
    "the tree - level charged current operators may change that prediction .",
    "the modes @xmath25 ( both neutral and charged ) have also been measured , and the averaged brs are @xcite : br(b^+ k^+ ) & = & ( 8.581.24)10 ^ -6 , + br(b^0 k^0 ) & = & ( 8.721.37)10 ^ -6 , where the near equality is expected from the isospin symmetry .",
    "the direct cp asymmetry is measured by babar @xcite for the charged mode and by belle @xcite for the neutral mode : a_cp(b^k^ ) & = & 0.050.20 0.03 + a_cp(bk_s ) & = & 0.56 0.41 0.12 .",
    "note again that both babar and belle conventions differ from ours in an extra minus sign .",
    "the mixing - induced cp asymmetry , which should give @xmath22 to a very good approximation , is ( at @xmath73 ) @xcite : ( 2)_bk_s & = & -0.19^+0.52_-0.500.09  ( babar ) + ( 2)_bk_s & = & -0.730.640.18  ( belle ) .",
    "though their central values are not compatible , one may still make an average : ( 2)_ave = -0.390.41 .",
    "we use the averaged values of br and mixing - induced cp asymmetries as our input parameters . for the direct cp asymmetry",
    ", we use the belle data , but it may be observed later that the in the entire allowed parameter space the direct cp asymmetry is rather small ( between @xmath74 and @xmath75 ) so that the babar numbers are not in trouble .",
    "the br for the @xmath25 mode is a sensitive function of @xmath24 .",
    "it has also been shown in @xcite that one needs to take into account the annihilation and nonfactorizable contributions , which push the br up by almost a factor of 2 .",
    "while the br is in perfect agreement with the nf model , there is no model which can explain the data on mixing - induced cp asymmetry without invoking new physics . for this purpose , in our analysis , we use the nf model to calculate the br keeping @xmath24 a free parameter , which we take to be the same for both @xmath26 and @xmath14 modes just for simplicity .",
    "we will also comment on what happens when one relaxes the br constraint on @xmath26 .",
    "r - parity is a global quantum number , defined as @xmath76 , which is @xmath77 for all particles and @xmath78 for all superparticles . in the minimal version of supersymmetry and some of its variants , r - parity",
    "is assumed to be conserved _",
    "ad hoc _ , which prevents single creation or annihilation of superparticles .",
    "however , models with broken r - parity can be constructed naturally , and such models have a number of interesting phenomenological consequences .",
    "the crucial point is that unlike most extensions of the sm , _ rpv contributes to b decay amplitudes at the tree level_. moreover , the current bounds @xcite on sparticle masses and couplings leave open the possiblity that such contributions can indeed be comparable to or even larger than the sm amplitude .",
    "it may be noted that the presence of two interfering amplitudes of comparable magnitude is essential for a large deviation of cp asymmetries from the sm prediction .",
    "it is well known that in order to avoid rapid proton decay one can not have both lepton number and baryon number violating rpv model , and we shall work with a lepton number violating one .",
    "this leads to slepton / sneutrino mediated b decays . since the current lower bound on the slepton mass is weaker than that on squark mass , larger effects within the reach of current round of experiments are more probable in this scenario .",
    "we start with the superpotential [ w ] w_ = _ijk l_i q_j d^c_k , where @xmath79 are quark and lepton generation indices ; @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the @xmath82-doublet lepton and quark superfields and @xmath83 is the @xmath82-singlet down - type quark superfield respectively .",
    "this leads to a four - fermi hamiltonian relevant for b decays @xcite : h _ & = & 14 d^r_jkn ( |d_n ^p_l d_j)_8 ( |d_k _ p_r b)_8 + & & + 14 d^l_jkn ( |d_n ^p_l b)_8 ( |d_k _ p_r d_j)_8 + & & + 14 u^r_jnk ( |u_n ^p_l u_j)_8 ( |d_k _ p_r b)_8 + h.c .",

    "= _ i _ijk^*_in3 2m_e_li^2 , and the subscript 8 indicates that the currents are in color su(3 ) octet - octet combination .    following the standard practice we shall assume that the rpv couplings are hierarchical _",
    "i.e. _ , only one combination of the couplings is numerically significant .",
    "let us note that both the transitions @xmath84 and @xmath25 are controlled by the quark - level transitions @xmath85 .",
    "thus , let us assume , to start with , only @xmath86 and @xmath87 to be nonzero , as has been done in @xcite .",
    "of course , @xmath14 modes can be fed by @xmath70 and @xmath88 transitions . since they affect other decay modes like @xmath89 where there is no apparent discrepancy with sm expectations , we assume those operators to be vanishing .    next let us discard @xmath86 too .",
    "the reason for this is that @xmath86 and @xmath90 are related by su(2 ) symmetry , and are the same if we neglect the electroweak d - term that causes the sneutrino - slepton mass splitting ( on the other hand , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are completely unrelated , and unless there is some underlying texture in the rpv couplings , there is no reason why they should be equal ) .",
    "however , presence of @xmath90 generates @xmath91 transition , which in turn affects the modes like @xmath3 which is used as a standard to extract @xmath22 .",
    "since the values of @xmath22 extracted from different charmonium modes , as well as from the @xmath92 mode with a different quark - level process , are almost the same @xcite , it is a safe assumption , also compatible with the principle of occam s razor , to have no rpv contribution to that channel .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath35 extracted from @xmath3 can be taken to be the sm value for that angle .",
    "the product coupling @xmath87 does not contribute to the @xmath93 box , so that there is no scope to have an extra box amplitude , in contrast to the situation , _",
    "e.g. _ , in @xcite ( but @xmath87 contributes to the @xmath94 box ; this is discussed later ) .",
    "the qcd corrections are easy to implement : the short - distance qcd corrections enhance the @xmath95 rpv operator by approximately a factor of 2 while running from the slepton mass scale ( assumed to be at 100 gev ) to @xmath96 @xcite .",

    "the present bound , as quoted in @xcite for the third slepton generation , is only @xmath122 , and that too assuming squarks at 100 gev .",
    "if one has 300 gev squarks , the bound gets weaker by a factor of 9 .",
    "however , one gets a comparatively better constraint from @xmath123 mixing , since nonzero values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 can generate a second amplitude for the box , with two sneutrinos and two right - handed strange quarks flowing inside the box . taking @xmath126 to be completely saturated by the rpv contribution , and using the experimental lower limit",
    ", one gets a bound on the product coupling which is approximately @xmath127 .",
    "the main loophole in the analysis is the fact that only an experimental upper bound can generate an upper bound on some unknown parameter ; moreover , it is questionable to neglect the sm contribution completely .",
    "even then we have an improvement by an order of magnitude .",
    "* figure 2 shows that @xmath102 should be positive for band i and negative for band ii .",
    "it can be checked easily that this ensures a positive direct cp asymmetry in all channels , and a negative mixing - induced cp asymmetry in @xmath2 .",
    "figure 3 shows the range of @xmath22 in this model , which is between the upper limit of @xmath128 and @xmath129 . the central value of belle , however , can not be reproduced .",
    "* figure 4 shows the mixing - induced cp asymmetry for @xmath69 . note that imposition of the belle data means a significant portion ( the region in the upper right - hand corner ) of the already weak band ii is ruled out , while band i is completely allowed .",
    "still , one can not rule out band ii completely .",
    "* the cp asymmetry in @xmath130 is found to lie between @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( the upper limit ) for band i , and between @xmath133 and @xmath132 for band ii .",
    "the direct cp asymmetry in the neutral channel lies between @xmath74 to @xmath134 .",
    "this is definitely compatible with the belle data , but again the central value is far away .",
    "one must wait for the error bars to come down .",
    "* the direct cp asymmetry for @xmath2 lies between @xmath74 and @xmath75 for band i and between @xmath74 and @xmath132 for band ii .",
    "this is in perfect harmony with the babar data too .",
    "+ let us try to understand why we get a nonzero @xmath104 .",
    "this is due to the constraint put by @xmath135 . to see this qualitatively ,",
    "let us assume that there is only one sm amplitude and both weak and strong phase differences vanish so that there is no direct cp asymmetry .",
    "it is easy to see that in that case there is no change in the prediction for @xmath22 , which is given only by the phase in the @xmath63 box . *",
    "the angle @xmath110 can take any value upto @xmath111 for band i. on the other hand , it can be only in the second quadrant for band ii .",
    "the origin of such a pattern can easily be traced back to the expressions of brs and cp asymmetries of the @xmath14 modes . ref .",
    "@xcite estimates @xmath136 at 95% cl from different @xmath137 and @xmath138 modes .",
    "these modes are not affected by @xmath87 , so one concludes that if there are no other nonzero rpv couplings , band ii is completely ruled out .",
    "thus , if the value of @xmath22 extracted from @xmath69 converges towards that found from @xmath3 , this solution will be in trouble . however , the error bars are too large to draw any definite conclusion right now . * as a check , we redo the analysis switching the @xmath25 br constraint off .",
    "there is no substantial change in the result , except that the lower bound on @xmath139 marginally decreases to @xmath140 .",
    "thus we consider our result to be fairly robust with respect to hadronic uncertainties . however , there is no upper limit on @xmath107 anymore .",
    "we have also explicitly checked that brs of the so far unobserved @xmath14 channels remain below their experimental upper bounds .",
    "we found that a minimal set of rpv couplings , compatible with all present data , can explain the br anomalies for @xmath97 and @xmath8 , and the unusual value of @xmath22 from @xmath2 .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that rpv contributes to b decays at tree - level .",
    "a nice feature is that one can have points where the strong phase difference between rpv and sm is small , which is what one expects from the color transparency argument .    with more data pouring in",
    ", one can significantly shrink the allowed parameter space for rpv .",
    "however , even at present we get sufficiently strong bound on the relevant product coupling  better by two orders of magnitude at least .",
    "what other effects are mediated by the product coupling @xmath141 ? this generates a top decay channel @xmath142 , whose strength is , unfortunately , only a few per cent of the corresponding sm channel .",
    "thus , the signal is essentially unobservable .",
    "a better signal may come from the strange squark mediated semileptonic top decays @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "this also generates @xmath145 or @xmath146 decays .",
    "the third effect is a new box amplitude in @xmath123 mixing . here ,",
    "also , the amplitude is only at a few per cent level compared to the sm amplitude , so we do not expect any significant cp asymmetry in channels like @xmath147 even if @xmath108 is large .",
    "we have not discussed the product coupling @xmath86 which can also explain the anomalies that are studied in this paper . as we mentioned before , that coupling also generates the su(2 ) conjugate transition @xmath148 .",
    "this may jeopardize the predictions from the @xmath3 channel , for example .",
    "however , a nonzero phase in @xmath86 should show up in the @xmath94 box , _ i.e. _ , one may get a significant cp - asymmetry in the channel @xmath147 , contrary to the sm expectation .",
    "the reason is simple : rpv contributes to both the box amplitude and to the decay @xmath148 .",
    "the rare decays @xmath149 or @xmath150 also receive a tree - level contribution from @xmath86 and may be pushed up to the observable level .    at present",
    ", one has to wait for the errors to come down .",
    "this may rule out part or all of one or both bands ( existence of band ii is already under threat from the fit of @xmath110 , as we have shown ) .",
    "however , if the bands still remain allowed , one should look for any unexpected cp asymmetry signal in @xmath94 decays .",
    "only such correlated studies can unravel the exact nature of new physics .",
