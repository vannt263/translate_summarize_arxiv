    "the observation of diffraction and interference of electron waves would provide the crucial test of the existence of wave nature of electrons . this observation was first seen in 1927 by c. j. davisson and l. h. germer.@xcite they studied electron scattering from a target consisting of a single crystal of nickel ( ni ) and investigated this phenomenon extensively .",

    "observed , there is a strong scattering maximum at an angle of 50@xmath0 .",
    "the angle for maximum scattering of waves from a crystal depends on the wavelength of the waves and the spacing of the atoms in the crystal . using the known spacing of atoms in their crystal",
    ", they calculated the wavelength that could produce such a maximum and found that it agreed with the de broglie s hypothesis for the electron energy they were using . by varying the energy of the incident electrons",

    "are thought to act as a reflective diffraction grating .",
    "when electrons are scattered by the ni ( 111 ) surface ( single crystal ) , the electrons strongly interact with electrons inside the system .",
    "thus electrons are scattered by a ni single layer .",
    "the ni ( 111 ) surface is just the two - dimensional layer for electrons . in other textbooks,@xcite electrons",

    "we will show that the ni layers act as a reflective diffraction grating .",
    "the 2d scattering of electrons on the ni ( 111 ) , ni(100 ) , and ni(110 ) surfaces will be discussed in terms of the concept of the bragg rod ( or bragg ridge ) which intersects the surcae of the ewald sphere.@xcite we will show that the experimental results@xcite obtained by davisson and germer can be well explained in terms of this model .",
