    "as more and more brown dwarfs and planetary companions are being discovered , characterizing them in the visible regime yields a more complete picture of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and more insight into physical properties as well as formation scenarios .",
    "for instance , a better estimate of extinction helps to derive bolometric luminosity and mass  especially for young objects ( @xmath13 myr ) which may still have primeval dust and gas around them and suffer significant obscuration . however , extinction is problematic to measure because most of the high - contrast adaptive optics ( ao ) observations are done in the near - infrared , which is @xmath14 times less sensitive to dust at @xmath15 versus @xmath16 .",
    "one simple treatment is to assume that the companion has the same amount of extinction as its host star @xcite , since in the early stages of star formation the binary might be embedded in a common envelope . for more evolved , fragmented systems both components may have their own disks , so this assumption might be invalid . ideally one would like to acquire visible spectra or at least broad - band visible photometry to supplement near - ir measurements because visible wavelengths are a better probe for dust extinction . yet",
    "high contrast optical observations on companions are very rare due to decreased contrast @xcite and the difficulty of correcting atmospheric turbulence at visible ( defined here as @xmath17 m ) wavelengths .",
    "we therefore need an advanced ao system which can work in the visible to suppress the halo .    here",
    "we present the first optical ao photometry of ct chamaeleontis system with the magellan adaptive optics ( magao ) system , a powerful new 585-element ao system commissioned on the 6.5 m clay telescope @xcite .",
    "ct cha a , a k7 classical t tauri star @xcite , is located in the chamaeleon i star - forming region .",
    "this region is close ( @xmath18 pc ; @xcite ) and is as young ( median age @xmath19 myr ; @xcite ) as the taurus star - forming region and ic 348 .",
    "it also has relatively low extinction ( typical @xmath20 mag ; @xcite ) , enabling clear view of young stars .",
    "the companion ct cha b at 2.67(430 au ) projected separation was discovered by @xcite in their vlt naco survey . based on its near - ir spectrum ,",
    "the companion was estimated to be an m8-to - l0 ( @xmath21 k ) low mass ( @xmath22 @xmath8 ) brown dwarf with @xmath23 mag .",
    "@xcite also imaged another closer object termed `` cc2 '' , whose true nature has remained puzzling @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present new visible ao observations providing a better measurement of @xmath24 and of the mass of ct cha b. our accurate astrometry allows us to determine that cc2 is , in fact , a background source .",
    "magao observations with its visao camera @xcite at @xmath25 m ) , @xmath26 m ) , @xmath27 m ) , and @xmath28 m ) were performed on 2013 april 6 ( ut ) during the second commissioning run .",
    "seeing was stable , ranging from 0.6to 0.8 .",
    "we locked the ao system on ct cha a ( @xmath29 mag ) at 100 modes and 625 hz . mag guide stars . ]",
    "the achieved fwhms were 0.1 , 0.08 , 0.06 , 0.06 for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "strehl ratios were low due to only correcting 100 modes , since the guide star was somewhat faint for visao .",
    "we obtained saturated images to boost signal - to - noise ratio , with unsaturated datasets for relative photometry ( top row in figure [ fig1 ] ) . as a young accreting star ,",
    "ct cha a varies its brightness by @xmath30 mag in the near - ir and @xmath31 mag in the optical @xcite . in order to calibrate the brightness of ct cha",
    "a , we also obtained absolute photometry by observing the optical photometric standard star ltt 3864 .",
    "we carried out standard data reduction with iraf tasks .",
    "after dark - subtraction , flat - field correction , and cross - correlation between frames , we rotated counterclockwise the saturated data by 89.11+parallactic angle to make north up and east left ( middle row in figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this was following the calibration of visao camera based on astrometry of the trapezium cluster @xcite .",
    "we further rotated each of these images by 20 , 40 , ... , 340 and took the median of them to approximate the halo of the primary .",
    "then we subtracted the halo from the original images to further bring out any faint point source object ( bottom row in figure [ fig1 ] ) without any loss of flux from self - subtraction .",
    "anisoplanatic effects are still small at this small separation ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "only our bluest filter @xmath33 showed some sign of anisoplanatism , so we smoothed the reduced @xmath0 image with a gaussian ( width @xmath34 ) to enhance signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "next we constructed a master psf from unsaturated images of a , used it to fit ct cha b profile in the deep images , and measured the psf fitting flux with the daophot @xmath35 task .",
    "we note here that the on - axis ct cha a psf was still an excellent fit to the 2.7 off - axis psf of b. table [ tbl-1 ] summarizes our observations and psf fitting photometry on ct cha b. uncertainties of b are @xmath36 mag for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , and @xmath37 mag for @xmath0 due to low s / n .",
    "near - ir ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) photometry and the @xmath41 mag uncertainty were adopted from @xcite .    to increase the accuracy of our astrometry",
    ", we also corrected for image distortion ( @xmath42 mas ) .",
    "the exact formulae to correct any residual distortions for separation @xmath43 from @xmath44 are listed in @xcite and reproduced here : @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "we also retrieved archive hst and vlt naco data for proper motion analysis .",
    "the hst data were already reduced by the opus pipeline and the multidrizzle software , as described in @xcite .",
    "we reduced naco raw frames by shift - and - add , without flat - field correction and dark - subtraction .",
    "naco image distortion is very small and only up to 3 mas at field edges @xcite .",
    "the error budget of our measurements includes platescale and centroid uncertainties .",
    "table [ tbl-2 ] lists our astrometric measurements .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the ct cha system seen with our broad - band filters , with ct cha b and cc2 visible in all four .",
    "this is the first optical detection of ct cha b , as it was not detected in previous hst narrow - band optical observations @xcite .",
    "judging from its color , cc2 is relatively blue ( @xmath49 ) so unlikely to be another low - mass companion .",
    "@xcite also speculated that a faint `` object '' seen at [ oi ] @xmath50to the south of ct cha a could be real , but we can not confirm any other faint object in our images , especially at @xmath0 where a narrow band [ oi ] or h@xmath10 source might have been visible .",
    "thus , it is unlikely to be a real object .",
    "the nature of cc2 is not fully settled in literature .",
    "@xcite presented two - year astrometry , showing that it is likely to be a background star . but @xcite suggested that cc2 may be physically associated based on their single epoch hst observations .",
    "we measured the positions of cc2 and ct cha b in images taken by various instruments over @xmath51 year time span ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "significant common - proper motion has been found for ct cha b , confirming it is physically bound .",
    "however , we detected a significant non - common @xmath52 mas / yr northwestward motion for cc2 , unambiguously demonstrating that it is not a co - moving companion but instead a background star , and not a member of chamaeleon i.        to further narrow down the uncertainty of @xmath53 , we retrieved the spectrum taken with the vlt sinfoni spectrograph @xcite , and calculated the @xmath54o - k2 index following the prescription of @xcite . assuming solar metallicity",
    ", we found that for ct cha b this index is almost independent of extinction , ranging from 0.65 to 0.66 for @xmath55 to 5.5 mag . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , we plotted the variation of the index with a range of surface gravity for @xmath56 k bt - settl atmospheric models @xcite . within this temperature range ,",
    "@xmath54o - k2 index is rather insensitive to log @xmath57 .",
    "hence we are free to use it for young cool objects like ct cha b. our best fit to the index corresponds to a spectral type m@xmath58 with @xmath59 k.      ct cha b was previously estimated from near - ir spectroscopy to have an extinction higher than its host star ( @xmath605.2 mag versus 1.3 mag ; @xcite ) .",
    "our data benefit from the fact that visible wavelengths are more sensitive to dust extinction , so we can determine @xmath24 at higher precision with magao s visao camera .",
    "we applied multiple values of @xmath24 following the extinction law in @xcite to redden the 2500 k bt - settl synthetic spectra normalized at @xmath40 ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "minimization of the reduced @xmath61 is based on the reddened models fit to the observed @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 photometry ( black points in figure [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we found that while the result is independent of surface gravity , @xmath62 remains high even after including the @xmath63 mag uncertainty at @xmath40 .",
    "some systematic errors may come into play .",
    "for example , the adopted extinction law might be invalid due to grain growth in the disk , or there could be multiple dust components .",
    "on the other hand , scattered light from the disk or outflow gas may contribute to our @xmath1 photometry , as in the case of r mon @xcite . in this picture , blue light follows indirect paths to the observer , avoiding passing through the disk and making our extinction estimate likely a lower limit .",
    "another possible cause for higher @xmath62 is that an overall offset @xmath64 mag might exist between the visible and near - ir data because they were taken on different nights and ct cha a is a well - known variable .",
    "finally , the companion itself could also be variable in the visible just like the primary due to accretion . in any case , with no prior knowledge of the material around ct cha b , our current data yield a best fit to a lower extinction @xmath6 mag .",
    "we plotted the reddened synthetic spectrum together with the observed photometry in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "we followed the approach in @xcite to calculate the bolometric luminosity .",
    "we converted our @xmath1 photometry to cousins @xmath65 , de - reddened it by @xmath66 mag , applied the bolometric correction from @xcite and @xcite , and obtained log@xmath67 . as a comparison , we also calculated @xmath68 from the @xmath15 flux following @xcite and had a similar value log@xmath69 .",
    "both values are consistent with log@xmath70 in @xcite .",
    "we also calculated ct cha b s radius using @xmath71 and obtained @xmath72 .",
    "then we applied the dusty evolutionary tracks @xcite to derive a mass estimate of @xmath73 based on the @xmath74 myr age and @xmath53 ( figure [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "therefore , ct cha b is most likely a very low mass brown dwarf , just above the planetary mass limit .",
    "pa@xmath75 emission , an accretion signature , has been seen in ct cha b s @xmath76band spectrum @xcite . since ct cha b",
    "is widely separated from the host star , it may harbor its own disk and still be actively accreting at this time .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows that our @xmath0 detection is about 20 times brighter than its predicted continuum .",
    "this significant @xmath0 excess seems to imply strong h@xmath10 emission from accretion , allowing us to calculate the mass accretion rate . attributing @xmath77 of the @xmath0 flux to h@xmath10 and following the prescription of @xcite , we estimated @xmath78 , which is reasonable as it implies that a few @xmath79 of brown dwarf mass could be accreted in a few million years at the end of the gas - rich disk phase .",
    "the accretion rate we derived is also consistent with recent hst observations by @xcite , who measured @xmath80 for three substellar companions gsc 6214 - 210 b , gq lup b , and dh tau b based on their optical excess .",
    "the different extinction between the primary and the secondary may imply that both objects have their own disks likely with different inclination angles , resembling conceptually the configuration of hk tau a and b @xcite .",
    "ct cha b s",
    "@xmath0 excess , together with other accreting objects in @xcite , suggest that accretion disks could be common among young low - mass companions and favor the `` star - like '' formation via gravitational collapse and fragmentation of molecular clouds .",
    "the survival of these significant disks also implies that substellar companions form near their current locations rather than being ejected there @xcite .",
    "strategic h@xmath10 surveys such as magao s ongoing giant accreting proto - planets survey ( gapplanets ) may have the potential to probe @xmath81 accreting giant planets and shed light on the earliest stage of planet formation @xcite .",
    "magao observations on ct cha at @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 have improved the accuracy of the extinction towards ct cha b. the companion is detected in all of our optical filters , whereas no detections were made by hst .",
    "it is over - luminous at @xmath0 , indicating active accretion at a rate of @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath54o - k2 index derived from the @xmath40 spectrum is consistent with a @xmath82 k brown dwarf . using the bt - settl model ,",
    "we show that ct cha b is best fit by @xmath6 mag , which is lower than previous estimate and translates to a mass estimate of @xmath7 @xmath8 based on the dusty tracks .",
    "we do not see the faint southern [ oi ] source seen in previous hst observations , so it is unlikely to be real .",
    "finally , our astrometry on cc2 is incompatible with a previous claim that it is a co - moving object .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for helpful comments that greatly improved this manuscript .",
    "we thank professor jennifer patience for kindly providing the sinfoni spectra of ct cha b. we thank the whole magellan staff for making this wonderful telescope possible .",
    "we would especially like to thank povilas palunas ( for help over the entire magao commissioning run ) .",
