    "the investigation of the qcd phase diagram has become a research topic of highest priority .",
    "relativistic heavy ion collisions in the rhic era have provided results which confirm previous information about the critical temperature @xmath3 mev of the hadronization transition in the approximately baryon - free regime @xcite , which parallels the situation a few microseconds after the big bang .",
    "this value is in agreement with the deconfinement transition temperature calculated in 2 + 1 flavor lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "these simulations are now extended into the region of ( small ) finite chemical potentials where one of the characteristic features is a critical endpoint of first order phase transitions ( tricritical point ) .",
    "future heavy - ion collision experiments planned at gsi darmstadt ( fair ) will explore the phase diagram in the finite density domain and hope to find experimental signatures of the tricritical point .",
    "in dense quark matter at temperatures below @xmath4 mev , due to attractive interaction channels , the cooper pairing instability is expected to occur which should lead to a variety of possible quark pair condensates corresponding to color superconductivity ( csc ) phases , see @xcite for a review . since it is difficult to provide low enough temperatures for csc phases in heavy - ion collisions , only precursor phenomena @xcite",
    "are expected under these conditions .",
    "csc phases may occur in neutron star interiors @xcite and could manifest themselves , e.g. , in the cooling behavior @xcite .",
    "however , the domain of the qcd phase diagram where neutron star conditions are met is not yet accessible to lattice qcd studies and theoretical approaches have to rely on nonperturbative qcd modeling .",
    "the class of models closest to qcd are dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) approaches which have been extended recently to finite temperatures and densities @xcite . within simple , infrared - dominant dse models early studies of quark stars @xcite and diquark condensation",
    "@xcite have been performed .",
    "the present contribution will be based on results which have been obtained within a nonlocal chiral quark model ( ncqm ) using a covariant , separable representation of the gluon propagator @xcite with formfactors suitable for an extension to finite temperatures and chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "alternative approaches to separable chiral quark models are based on the instanton approach @xcite . as a limiting case , the well - known nambu ",
    "jona - lasinio ( njl ) model is obtained for a cutoff formfactor . for recent applications of the njl model to qcd at high density in compact stars , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "a different class of qcd - models is of the bag - model type .",
    "these models do not describe the chiral phase transition in a self - consistent way and will not be considered here .",
    "we will consider within a ncqm the following questions : ( i ) is strange quark matter relevant for structure and evolution of compact stars ?",
    "( ii ) are stable hybrid stars with quark matter interior possible ?",
    "( iii ) what can we learn about possible csc phases from neutron star cooling ?",
    "in order to answer the question whether strange quark matter phases should be expected in the neutron star interiors , we consider here a three - flavor generalization of a ncqm with the action @xmath6 = \\int_k\\big\\{\\bar q(k ) ( \\ ! \\not k - \\hat m)q(k )                \\nonumber \\\\             & & + d_0 \\int_{k^\\prime}\\sum_{\\alpha=0}^{8 }                    [ j_s^\\alpha(k)j_s^\\alpha(k^\\prime )   + j_p^\\alpha(k)j_p^\\alpha(k^\\prime)]\\big\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 .",
    "we restrict us here to the scalar current @xmath8 and the pseudoscalar current @xmath9 in dirac space with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being quark 4-spinors and the formfactor @xmath12 accounts for the nonlocality of the interaction .",
    "for the applications to compact stars , the quark matter equation of state is needed and can be obtained from the partition function @xmath13 = \\int { \\cal d}\\bar q { \\cal d}q \\exp\\left (           { \\cal s}[q , \\bar q ]   - \\int_k    \\hat\\mu\\gamma^0\\bar qq \\right),\\ ] ] where the constraint of baryon number conservation is realized by the diagonal matrix of chemical potentials @xmath14 ( lagrange multipliers ) . further details concerning the notation and the parametrization of this model can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to perform the functional integrations over the quark fields @xmath15 and @xmath16 we use the formalism of bosonisation which is based on the hubbard - stratonovich transformation of the four - fermion interaction .",
    "the resulting transformed partition function in terms of bosonic variables will be considered in the mean - field approximation @xmath17=   { \\rm \\large e}^{\\large -2n_c \\sum_f\\bigg[\\frac{\\phi_f^2}{8d_0 }   + \\int_k \\ln(m_f^2-\\tilde k_f^2 ) \\bigg]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the 4-vector @xmath18 and the effective quark masses @xmath19 containing the flavor dependent mass gaps @xmath20 . in the mean field approximation ,",
    "the grand canonical thermodynamical potential is @xmath21/{\\cal      z}[0,\\{0\\}]\\right\\}~ , \\ ] ] where fluctuations are neglected and the divergent vacuum contribution has been subtracted .",
    "the quark mass gaps @xmath20 are determined by solving the gap equations which correspond to the minimization conditions @xmath22 and read @xmath23 as can be seen from ( [ eq:14 ] ) , for the chiral @xmath0 quark model the three gap equations for @xmath24 are decoupled and can be solved separately .    in what follows",
    "we consider the case @xmath25 only .",
    "all thermodynamical quantities can now be derived from eq .",

    "a systematic extension to other choices of formfactors can be found in @xcite .",
    "the gaussian model has four free parameters to be defined : the coupling constant @xmath29 , the interaction range @xmath30 , and the current quark masses @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",

    "the quark - quark interaction in the color anti - triplet scalar diquark channel is attractive driving the pairing with a large zero - temperature pairing gap @xmath48  mev for the quark chemical potential @xmath49  mev .",

    "it includes a 2-flavor color superconductivity ( 2sc ) phase for which quarks of one color , say blue , remain unpaired .",
    "the color - flavor locking ( cfl ) phase @xcite requires approximate su(3 ) flavor symmetry and can be excluded from our discussion since strange quarks remain confined up to the highest densities occuring in a compact star configuration @xcite .",
    "in describing the hadronic shell of a hybrid star we exploit a parametrized form @xcite of the argonne @xmath59 model of the eos given in @xcite , which is based on the most recent models for the nucleon - nucleon interaction with the inclusion of a parameterized three - body force and relativistic boost corrections .",
    "all details concerning the eos and the hadronic cooling processes are given in @xcite . as we have seen in the previous section",
    ", it may be sufficient to discuss only two - flavor quark matter for applications to compact stars .",
    "we will focus on the model of the quark eos developed in @xcite as an instantaneous approximation to the covariant ncqm ( incqm ) .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been demonstrated on the example of the hadron - quark mixed phase that finite size effects might play a crucial role by substantially narrowing the region of the mixed phase or even preventing its appearance .",
    "therefore we omit the possibility of the hadron - quark mixed phase in our model where the quark phase arises by the maxwell construction . for the case of the instantaneous gaussian formfactor with 2sc phase the quark core appears for @xmath60 . without 2sc phase or for the lorentzian or njl formfactor no stable hybrid stars",
    "are obtained , see fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] .    in order to describe the cooling of stable hybrid star configurations",
    ", we use the approach to the hadronic cooling developed recently in ref .",
    "@xcite and add the contribution due to the quark core , see @xcite . once in the quark matter core of a hybrid star",
    "unpaired quarks are present the dominant quark direct urca ( qdu ) process is operative and cools the star too fast in disagreement with the observational data @xcite . if one allows for a residual weak pairing channel as , e.g. , the csl one with typical gaps of @xmath61  kev - @xmath62  mev , see @xcite , the hybrid star configuration will not be affected but the qdu cooling process will be efficiently suppressed as is required for a successful description of compact star cooling . since we do nt know yet the exact pairing pattern for which also the residual ( in 2sc unpaired ) quarks are paired in the 2-flavor quark matter , we will call this hypothetical phase `` 2sc+x '' .",
    "in such a way all the quarks may get paired , either strongly in the 2sc channel or weakly in the x channel . if now the x - gap is of the order of @xmath63 mev , then the qdu process will be effectively switched off and the cooling becomes too slow , again in disagreement with the data @xcite .",
    "this seems to be a weak point and we would like to explore whether a density - dependent x - gap could allow a description of the cooling data within a larger interval of compact star masses .",
    "for such a density - dependent x - gap function we employ the ansatz @xmath64~.\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : cool - csl - x ] we show the resulting cooling curves for the parameters @xmath65 mev and @xmath66 .",
    "we observe that the mass interval for compact stars which obey the cooling data constraint ranges now from @xmath67 for slow coolers up to @xmath68 for fast coolers such as vela .",
    "we have presented the qcd phase diagram obtained within the ncqm approach .",
    "we find that in the framework of our model for neutron star applications it is sufficient to consider only two quark flavors since the critical densities of strange quark deconfinement are not accessible in typical compact star interiors .",
    "we investigate the phase transition between superconducting quark matter and hadronic matter under neutron star constraints and find that stable hybrid stars are possible with large quark matter cores in the 2sc phase .",
    "the solution of the cooling evolution shows that the presence of ungapped quark species entails too fast cooling due to the qdu process in disagreement with modern neutron star cooling data .",
    "a successful description of hybrid star cooling requires a pairing pattern in the quark matter core ( if it exists ) where all quarks are gapped and a weak pairing channel is present with a gap which does not exceed about @xmath69 kev with a decreasing density dependence . a precise microscopic model for this conjectured `` 2sc+x '' phase is still lacking .",
    "possible candidate for a weak pairing channel is the color- spin - locking ( csl ) phase .",
    "we have demonstrated on the example of hybrid star cooling how astrophysical observations could provide constraints for microscopic approaches to the qcd phase diagram in the domain of cold dense matter not accessible to heavy - ion collision experiments and lattice qcd simulations .",
