    "it turns out that this is a special case of a rather general construction , which works for all primes @xmath0 , in fact for all prime powers @xmath11 .",
    "it starts with certain _ artin  schreier curves _ and leads , with a few exceptions for small prime powers , to _ surfaces of general type_.    the goal of this paper is to describe the geometry of these surfaces , and we obtain a fairly complete description .",
    "the construction goes as follows : fix an algebraically closed ground field @xmath12 of characteristic @xmath13 and consider artin  schreier curves of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a monic polynomial of degree @xmath16 .",
    "these curves carry a translation action of the additive group @xmath17 , and we consider the diagonal action on the product @xmath18 of two such artin  schreier curves .",
    "the quotient @xmath19 is a normal surface containing a unique singularity .",
    "such singularities are examples of _ wild quotient singularities _",

    "peculiar properties of wild @xmath23-quotient singularities in relation to punctual hilbert schemes appear in @xcite . in light of the scarcity of examples , it is useful to have more classes of wild quotient singularities in which computations are feasible .",

    "he compiled a list of open questions @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper , lorenzini studied wild @xmath22-quotient singularities resulting from diagonal actions on products of @xmath18 , where one or both factors are ordinary curves @xcite . in some sense , we treat the opposite situation , as artin - schreier curves have vanishing @xmath0-rank , and our main concern is the interplay between the local structure coming from the the wild quotient singuarity and the global geometry of the algebraic surface .",
