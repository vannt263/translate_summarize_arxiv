    "are rejected . as there are rejected moves ,",
    "the global balance condition is no longer guaranteed : the number of accepted forward chains can be different from the number of accepted backward chains ( see section  [ s : balances ] ) . when allowing chains in both the @xmath136 directions , however , the isolation layer algorithm satisfies detailed balance .",
    "furthermore , in order to limit the rejection rate , the per - chain total displacement @xmath27 has to be kept lower than in the serial algorithm . in view of the discussion of section  [ s : polytope ] , these necessities reduce somewhat the efficiency of the method . due to the isolation layers ,",
    "the accessible configuration space is restricted , and for ergodicity , the layer boundaries have to be resampled periodically , as in the four - color version of local monte carlo .",
    "we have implemented the isolation layer algorithm in parallel on a shared - memory machine .",
    "using several cores in parallel , it is possible to achieve effective collision rates which are 1030 times the single - core performance ( see fig .",
    "[ f : stripescheme ] ) , for systems of sufficient size . for systems too small , less threads can be used without shrinking the active strips to a point where the acceptance ratio becomes a limiting factor .",
    "systems of physical interest , however , are on the order of @xmath137 , and allow to use 1020 cores with moderate @xmath27 . at this time",
    ", the algorithm is not bound by rejection rates , but by communication between threads .    finally",
    ", the event - chain scheme is not fundamentally limited to a single moving disk at any time .",
    "we may indeed launch multiple _ concurrent chains _ , which run at the same simulated md time , and interact with each other .",
    "this is different from the parallel simulation of chains which interact in sequential manner . in the invariant polytope picture",
    ", multiple concurrent chains correspond to choosing more general initial conditions , where more than one disk is given an initial velocity of @xmath59 .",
    "after time @xmath27 , multiple chains have executed , and possibly interacted with each other ; there is no rejection in this algorithm .",
    "the problem has some resemblance with event - driven molecular dynamics , because the scheduling of collisions must be foreseen , but there are several simplifications : all velocities are in the same direction and of magnitude @xmath89 or @xmath59 . as a consequence , two moving disks",
    "can not collide with one other ; however , the faithful simulation of chains close by and possibly interacting requires careful synchronization among threads . in our experiments , this limits the speedup by parallelization .",
    "our most efficient method at this point is the isolation layer algorithm .",
    "we have reached in this paper a better understanding of the event - chain monte carlo algorithm for the hard - disk sampling problem . by restricting the algorithm to chains in a single direction",
    ", a connection appears to the well - known problem of sampling random points from a polytope : a move of the event - chain algorithm consists in performing a finite - time molecular dynamics simulation in the invariant polytope of the disk configuration .",
    "this connection offers new strategies to solve the hard - disk sampling problem in terms of polytope sampling ; it also suggests to investigate the utility of event - chain methods for the sampling of general polytopes .",
    "finally , it will be interesting to study the combinatorial structure of the typical invariant polytope , and its dependence on thermodynamical parameters .    by the study of correlation functions",
    ", we have shown that the monte carlo relaxation process in the invariant polytope separates into two phases : a rapid longitudinal relaxation , followed by a much slower relaxation of the transverse degrees of freedom .",
    "we have given recommendations for the parameters of the algorithm based on these results .",
    "finally , we have discussed several strategies for parallelizing monte carlo algorithms for hard disks , alleviating the problem of the long simulation times in hard disk monte carlo .",
    "the parallelization of the hard - disk ensemble remains challenging due to its unique combination of very little actual computation and long correlation times .",
    "efficient methods to tackle the hard - disk ensemble are , however , crucial in order to treat related systems such as soft disks with the same level of success as the hard disks .",
    "new concepts such as the link to polytope sampling will be essential in this effort .",
