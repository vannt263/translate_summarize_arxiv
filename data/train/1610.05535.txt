    "long - distance electron transfer ( et ) plays an essential role in biological energy conversion @xcite .",
    "representative are those in photosynthetic reaction centers in which photon energy is converted to electrochemical energy via series of ets through redox centers embedded in transmembrane protein .",
    "a simple but fundamental question open to microscopic investigation is how the protein environment is involved in the et : the protein structure could be involved passively by simply holding the redox centers at appropriate spatial configuration , or actively by providing intermediate virtual states for superexchange et mechanism @xcite .    to address this and related questions ,",
    "quantum mechanical investigation based on realistic molecular structure is essential .",
    "however , first - principles treatment of electrons in large biomolecular systems is still a formidable task . in this",
    "regard , fragment - based approaches , such as the fragment molecular orbital ( fmo ) @xcite , divide - and - conquer @xcite , and many others @xcite appear promising .    in a series of papers , we have reported calculations of et coupling matrix element and et pathways @xcite from the linear - combination of fmos ( fmo - lcmo ) @xcite with the two - body correction ( fmo2 ) .",
    "the method was found to give accurate et couplings over four orders of magnitude along the et distance when the bond detached atoms ( bda ) were not involved or when the minimal atomic basis set was used @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the problem of degraded mo energies caused by bdas with atomic basis sets larger than minimal set , that had been already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , carried over to the et analysis .",
    "recently , however , kobori et al . have found notable remedy of mo energies with the three - body correction ( fmo3 ) @xcite . following this",
    ", we study in this work how the fmo3 correction affects the et coupling energy and et pathway analysis .",
    "we also examine selection of the fmo space . in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to remove linear dependence of basis functions associated with bdas , a canonical transformation of hamiltonian matrix , @xmath0 where the matrix @xmath1 diagonalizes overlap matrix , was employed .",
    "however , this transformation often mixes the fmos in unwanted ways for the et pathway analysis , particularly for studying inter - fragment tunneling current .",
    "we found that the problem can be evaded by a projection to restricted fmo space instead of the canonical transformation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : uhu ] ) .",
    "for instance , with fmo - lc(vc)mo scheme , which restricts to the minimal - valence ( v ) plus core ( c ) mo space , the smallest eigenvalue of overlap matrix for systems studied in this work was 0.225 , which is large enough to regard the fmo space linearly independent @xcite .    for numerical demonstration , we examine hole transfer between two triptophane ( trp ) residues bridged by helical polyproline oligopeptide , which serves a good model of long - distance ets observed in metal - derivatized oligoprolines @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical works @xcite have employed the same model systems to study the effects of solvent and bridge - conformation dynamics on the electronic coupling .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] outlines the theoretical framework .",
    "section [ sec : comput ] describes the computational details .",
    "applications to hole transfer between two trp molecules bridged by polyproline linker systems are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] concludes .",
    "here we outline the fmo - lcmo method @xcite to explain the present projection scheme to the restricted fmo space .",
    "the fmo - lcmo hamiltonian up to the three - body fmo3 correction is described as @xmath2 in which @xmath3 consists of monomer fock matrices , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the two- and three - body corrections .",
    "the intra - fragment block of @xmath4 , between fmos @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the same fragment @xmath8 , is given by @xmath9 whereas the inter - fragment block is @xmath10 the terms in the right - hand - side of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fmo2ii ] ) and ( [ eq : fmo2ij ] ) will be defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hii])([eq : hijx ] ) .    the fmo3 correction to the intra- and",
    "inter - fragment blocks are @xmath11 and @xmath12    as noted in introduction , the canonical transformation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : uhu ] ) is not desired for the et pathway analysis .",
    "we thus simply limit the number of fmos and project the hamiltonian matrix to this set .",
    "we denote this restricted fmo ( rfmo )  space . therefore , the terms in the right - hand - side of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fmo2ii])([eq : fmo3ij ] ) in the selected rfmo space @xmath13 are defined as follows . with the fragment monomer , dimer , and trimer represented by @xmath14 , and @xmath15 ,",
    "the intra - fragment blocks are defined by @xmath16 and @xmath17 whereas the inter - fragment blocks are @xmath18 in the summation over @xmath19 in the right - hand - side , all the dimer and trimer fmos are taken , except the spurious ones stemming from the bdas .      to calculate the et coupling matrix element @xmath20 , we employ two methods ; generalized mulliken - hush ( gmh ) @xcite and bridge green function ( bgf ) @xcite .",
    "the gmh method scales the donor - acceptor mo energy splitting @xmath21 by a formula @xmath22 in which @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the diagonal and off - diagonal dipole matrix elements .",
    "it assumes that the hamiltonian and dipole matrix elements scale similarly for states involved in ets . despite its simplicity",
    ", the gmh formula ( [ eq : gmh ] ) has been successfully applied to a number of et reactions .",
    "the bgf method has been also demonstrated to give accurate and robust results with @xmath26 in which the sums over @xmath27 and @xmath28 exclude donor and acceptor mos , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the first term in the right - hand - side is the direct coupling between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the overlap matrix .",
    "@xmath32 is the bridge green function defined as @xmath33 in which @xmath34 is the projection operator to the mo space external to the donor - acceptor mos .",
    "the electron tunneling energy @xmath35 is naturally defined as the average of donor - acceptor orbital energies , @xmath36 .    in the tunneling current analysis @xcite",
    ", the et coupling @xmath20 is expressed as a sum of tunneling current @xmath37 between basis fmos @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath38 @xmath39 in which the summation over @xmath27 and @xmath28 are over the fmos within fragments @xmath8 and @xmath40 , and @xmath41 denotes the spatial region assigned to the donor molecule .",
    "the inter - orbital current @xmath37 is computed from the electronic hamiltonian and overlap matrices and the coefficients of fmo - lcmo , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , that represent the mixing of bridge fmos to the donor and acceptor fmos , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , in the initial ( ) and final ( ) states , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 these are thus computed straightforwardly from the fmo - lcmo method .",
    "the normalized inter - fragment tunneling current is defined by @xmath49 which satisfies @xmath50",
    "for the purpose of benchmarking the fmo3-lcmo calculations , we consider proline - trimer bridged systems , trp-(pro)@xmath51-trp , with two types of helix structure of polyproline ( pp ) linker , one with cis - configurations ( cispp ) and the other with trans - configurations ( transpp ) of peptide bonds .",
    "the former and latter proline trimers have the backbone dihedral angles @xmath52 of approximately @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "the cispp  and transpp  structures are schematically drawn in fig .",
    "1 . apparently the transpp  is more stretched .",
    "starting from typical conformations of cispp  and transpp , local strains were removed by geometry optimization at the b3lyp/6 - 31g(d)-d3 level , with the d3 version of grimme s dispersion correction with the original d3 damping function @xcite .",
    "we used gaussian09 program @xcite for the geometry optimization .",
    "the resultant molecular structures are displayed in fig .",
    "s1 and table s1 of the supplementary material .      in the fmo calculation , the trp-(pro)@xmath51-trp chain was divided into six fragments as designated in fig .",
    "2 , in which p1-p3 are the three prolines and mw denotes the main - chain of trp ( w ) .",
    "the @xmath55-carbon atoms were treated as bdas .",
    "the homos of trp fragments were taken as the donor and acceptor mos of hole transfer .",
    "the electronic coupling and tunneling current from the fmo2-lcmo and fmo3-lcmo methods were compared to a reference calculation with the rhf hamiltonian of the entire system of six fragments projected to the fmo space .",
    "we denote this last scheme fmo6-lcmo with the hamiltonian matrix @xmath56 where @xmath57 are mos in the rfmo space and @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the mos and mo energies of the entire system .",
    "we consider a minimal - valence plus core  rfmo space that includes the same number of mos as the minimal basis set such as sto-3 g . we denote this lc(vc)mo space .",
    "other choices of rfmo space , lumo , lumo+2 , lumo+6 , lumo+10 , to check the dependence on the size of rfmo space , are obtained by augmenting the lower unoccupied mos of each fragment to the occupied space .",
    "the 6 - 31g(d ) basis set was used .",
    "the total number of basis aos for the entire system is 774 .",

    "the number of fmos in the occupied , lc(vc)mo , and full spaces for each fragment are summarized in table i. for basis sets larger than the double - zeta basis , the lc(vc)mo scheme gives significant reduction .",
    "moreover , it removed the problem of linear - dependence observed previously @xcite , as the smallest eigenvalue of the overlap matrix in the lc(vc)mo space was 0.225 .",
    "we used the program gamess @xcite for the conventional fmo calculation @xcite . to estimate all inter - fragment tunneling currents including the long - distance ones",
