    "[ fig : softphoton - spec ] , we show an example of the soft photon spectrum used in our models . although x - ray emission is shown in @xcite , we do not include x - rays as soft photons , because the klein - nishina effect suppresses the ic scattering of x - rays .",

    "the values of @xmath59 and @xmath58 are different from our flare model for 2007 april 4 , and this may be possible because the values of @xmath59 and @xmath58 may be different from flare to flare . in the spectrum ,",

    "there are two breaks in the seds .",
    "namely , breaks at @xmath90 hz and @xmath91 hz . the break at @xmath92 corresponds to the ic scattering of ir photons by electrons with @xmath93 . on the other hand ,",

    "we assumed various values of @xmath59 in figure [ fig : sed - fit - tuv1ev ] .",

    "that is , the energy injection rate @xmath108 erg s@xmath7 is used to emit gev @xmath1-rays .",
    "this number is just consistent with our flare model , if the radiation efficiency during flares is low and most of the kinetic energy of electrons is transported to the he emission region . in our flare model ,",

    "the soft photon energy density is larger than the magnetic energy density and the effect of the difference in the magnetic field appears only in the synchrotron radiation .",
    "synchrotron emission exceeds the radio flux observed in the central @xmath66 when @xmath119 g. our model thus sets constraint on the average strength of the magnetic field in the central 1 pc region .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sed - fit - tev ] , we show a model with @xmath120 to see the possibility of tev emission by our model . here",
    "we assumed a smaller value of the electron injection rate than for the gev emission models , i.e. , @xmath121 s@xmath7 and this corresponds to the energy injection rate of @xmath122 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "this is much smaller than for model a3 ( dashed line ) , whose energy injection rate is @xmath104 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "since the maximum lorentz factor of electrons is much larger than our flare model , efficient acceleration of electrons must occur during the propagation from the flare region to the he emission region .",
    "alternatively , electrons from other sources such as pulsar wind nebulae are responsible for the tev emission .",
    "this kind of model was presented by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that the gev @xmath1-ray spectrum from sgr a@xmath0 obtained by _",
    "fermi _ is well fitted by ic scattering in a region with a radius of @xmath123 cm , when soft photons are supplied by stars and dust .",
    "we assumed that the nonthermal electrons are supplied by flare events near the central black hole , which are often observed in the nir and x - ray bands . to fit the _ fermi _ data",
    ", we assumed electrons with @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the success of our he emission model , in turn , supports our nir / x - ray flare model .",
    "we found that the magnetic field in the region within @xmath82 pc from the central black hole is @xmath3 g because synchrotron emission exceeds the observed radio flux in the central 1 pc region .",
    "the value of @xmath126 g is also consistent with another constraint given by @xcite .    because the distance that nonthermal electrons travel from the flare region to the he emission region is @xmath2 cm",
    ", the emission by those electrons during transport is to be considered .",
    "when electrons are close to a flare region , they emit radiation mostly by synchrotron emission . because the soft photon energy density in the he emission region is @xmath40 ev @xmath41 , synchrotron radiation dominates over ic scattering in regions with @xmath127 g. since the magnetic field of the flare emission region is @xmath39 g and that in the he emission region is @xmath126 g , synchrotron emission dominates over ic scattering in a region within @xmath128 cm from the central black hole , if the electron density is constant and the magnetic field decreases as @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the distance from the central black hole . then the volume of the synchrotron dominant region is smaller than that of the he emission region by a factor of @xmath131 .",
    "when the electron density decreases more rapidly than @xmath132 , the contribution of the central region to the synchrotron emission is significant .",
    "that is , a large flux of observed gev emission suggests that nonthermal electrons do not follow a wind - like flow . on the other hand , if @xmath129 is assumed as above , the decrease of the electron kinetic energy by synchrotron cooling is small . for example , if the lorentz factor of escaping electrons from a flare region at @xmath133 cm is @xmath87 , it decreases to @xmath134 at @xmath135 cm and is almost constant for @xmath136 cm .",
    "here we assumed that electrons propagate at speed of light .",
    "if the magnetic field decreases more rapidly than @xmath137 , this decrease in @xmath1 becomes slower .",
    "therefore , the effect of radiative cooling during electron transport from flare regions to the he emission region is not important .",
    "we assumed that the size of the he emission region , @xmath30 , is @xmath123 cm in this work .",
    "observationally there is no strong constraint on the value of @xmath30 , except that the he emission is consistent with no time variation during _ fermi _ observation .",
    "one possible constraint is that @xmath138 to fill the region of @xmath30 with electrons with @xmath1 up to @xmath58 , where @xmath139 is the ic cooling time .",
    "this sets the upper limit of @xmath140 cm for @xmath141 erg s@xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "the gev emission by ic scattering in a more compact region near the central black hole is unlikely as follows . in a region near the black hole ,",
    "the soft photon source is most likely the riaf and the magnetic filed is approximately @xmath82 g. when the gev emission is by ic scattering off soft photons , there is a constraint such that @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the energy density of the magnetic field .",
    "this results in @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the scattered energy fraction of riaf luminosity .",
    "when @xmath146 g , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 erg s@xmath7 , we obtain @xmath149 cm , which size is comparable with a flare emission region of our leptonic flare model . then the he emission region may exhibit time variation with timescale of @xmath150 s , contrary to the observed steady gev emission .    because tev @xmath1-rays are absorbed by @xmath22 pair production in collisions with soft photons",
    ", the soft photon density should be small enough to avoid the absorption to account for the tev emission observed by hess .",
    "the optical depth of the absorption is given by @xmath151 near the threshold , where @xmath152 is the thomson cross section and @xmath153 is the soft photon density . since @xmath78 cm , @xmath154 @xmath41",
    "is required for @xmath155 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : softphoton - spec ] , the soft photon spectrum has two peaks at ir and optical - uv bands . the photon density at the ir peak of @xmath156 hz is @xmath157 @xmath41 and this gives @xmath158 . at @xmath27 hz , on the other hand , @xmath159 @xmath41 for @xmath85 ev and @xmath160 erg @xmath41 .",
