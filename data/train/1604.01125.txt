    "characterizing inhomogeneous temporal patterns in natural and social phenomena  @xcite is important to understand underlying mechanisms behind such complex systems , hence even to predict and control them .",
    "recently , temporal inhomogeneities in event sequences have been described by bursts that are rapidly occurring events in short time periods alternating with long inactive periods  @xcite .",
    "bursty activity patterns of elements in a complex system turn out to strongly affect the collective dynamics emerging from interaction between elements , such as epidemic spreading or diffusion  @xcite .",
    "despite such a crucial role of bursts in complex systems , a quantification of burstiness remains largely unexplored .",
    "bursts for a given event sequence have often been characterized in terms of a heavy - tailed interevent time distribution @xmath0 , where the interevent time @xmath1 is defined as the time interval between two consecutive events .",
    "the interevent time distribution could be even reduced to a single number @xmath2 , called burstiness parameter  @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the standard deviation and the mean of interevent times , respectively , and @xmath6 is the coefficient of variation .",
    "@xmath2 has the value of @xmath7 for regular time series as @xmath8 , and @xmath9 for poissonian or random time series as @xmath10 . finally , the value of @xmath2 approaches @xmath11 for extremely bursty time series as @xmath12 for finite @xmath5 .",
    "this burstiness parameter has been widely used mainly due to its simplicity , e.g. , to analyze earthquake records , heartbeats of human subjects , and mobile phone communication patterns as well as to test models for bursty dynamics  @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 has been also used for investigating spatiotemporal organization of aftershocks in seismology  @xcite .",
    "in addition , higher order correlations between interevent times and long - range memory effects have been studied in terms of memory coefficient  @xcite , autocorrelation function or power spectrum  @xcite , and bursty train distribution  @xcite .",
    "we note that the behavior of burstiness parameter in eq .",
    "( [ eq : originalb ] ) may not be robust with respect to finite - size effects .",
    "the behavior of @xmath2 approaching @xmath11 is expected only when the number of events in the time series is sufficiently large or infinite . in other words , the maximum value of @xmath2 is strongly limited by the number of events . however , the numbers of events in datasets are finite for real systems , and they are often too small to draw statistically significant conclusions from data analysis .",
    "further , the number of events or activity level per individual is typically highly skewed , e.g. , in human dynamics  @xcite , implying that the majority of population has relatively small number of events .",
    "those individuals with low activity have been arbitrarily ignored , or aggregated to form a group of low activity .",
    "it could also be due to the absence of reliable measures of burstiness for finite event sequences .",
    "thus , the questions arise : how can one properly compare one bursty time series with another that shows similar bursty pattern but has the different number of events ?",
    "in other words , how can one isolate finite - size effects from the intrinsic temporal features in time series ?    in order to study finite - size effects on burstiness parameter",
    ", we devise an analytically tractable model to calculate the coefficient of variation of interevent times for finite event sequences in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "our model has two relevant factors , i.e. , a bursty period and a lower bound of interevent time . by tuning these two control parameters ,",
    "we can obtain the analytic values of @xmath2 for three reference cases ; regular , random , and extremely bursty time series .",
    "then we investigate the strong finite - size effects on @xmath2 for reference cases , enabling us to suggest an alternative definition of burstiness parameter that is free from finite - size effects and yet simple .",

    "we first consider an event sequence with @xmath14 events , each taking place uniformly at random in the time interval @xmath15 .",
    "the events are ordered by their timings , and the timing of the @xmath16th event is denoted by @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "we consider the case of periodic boundary condition in time for simplicity , while the case of open boundary condition is discussed in appendix  [ sect : obc ] .",
    "interevent times are defined as @xmath19 by the order statistics  @xcite , interevent time distributions are written as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the beta function , @xmath22 expectation values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 are obtained as @xmath25 and @xmath26 we have assumed that @xmath23s are independent of each other , although they are not independent but to satisfy the condition @xmath27 .",
    "instead we find on average that @xmath28 this issue will be discussed later in the next subsection .",
    "we now consider the general case that all events are localized in the interval @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , indicating that events do not take place in the intervals @xmath32 and @xmath33 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] . a similar model has been studied in a different context  @xcite .",

    "since we use periodic boundary condition , @xmath36 can be ignored .",
    "in addition , the lower bound of interevent time , @xmath37 , is introduced , implying that events must be separated from each other at least by @xmath37 .",
