    "noise measurements have found fruitful applications as a tool to probe both equilibrium and nonequilibrium transitions .",
    "an open question is whether phase transitions of the type observed in equilibrium systems can also occur in nonequilibrium systems , or whether it is even meaningful to refer to `` phases '' in the latter case .",
    "a particularly interesting issue is whether there are similarities between the melting transition of a thermal system and the disordered or plastic flow that occurs in a system driven out of equilibrium over quenched disorder . in this paper , we explore some suggestive similarities in the noise properties of equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems , based on our simulation studies @xcite of a wide range of physical systems .",
    "we are particularly interested in possible connections between the dynamical heterogeneities observed above the melting transition in a thermal system , and those found in the plastic or disordered flow state of a driven system .",
    "we begin by considering the noise produced during the melting of a vortex system confined to one dimension .",
    "we compare this to the case of a colloid system melting in two dimensions , and find that similar features appear in the noise .",
    "finally , we consider a driven system in the presence of quenched disorder , and show that as the driving force is decreased , similar noise signatures appear as when the temperature is increased in the thermal systems .",
    "we identify the heterogeneities responsible for the noise in each case , and suggest how noise signatures can be used to further probe these systems and increase our understanding of both melting and plasticity .    since this paper does not focus on a single system , but refers to work performed on several different physical systems , we offer some very brief background information here .",
    "ideal superconductors carry current without resistance and perfectly expel externally applied magnetic fields .",
    "the superconductivity is destroyed when too great a magnetic field is applied , and the material becomes a normal resistive conductor .",
    "type - ii materials remain superconducting in high magnetic fields by allowing the magnetic flux to penetrate the material in the form of discrete quantized vortices which repel each other and interact with defects in the superconducting material .",
    "the superconducting material returns to its normal resistive state only at the center of these vortices ; the remainder of the material still carries a supercurrent .",
    "the vortices experience a lorentz force from the flowing current and move through the superconductor until they are trapped , or pinned , at defect sites .",
    "another system of repulsive , overdamped particles which shows many of the same dynamical features as the vortex system is colloids , which are micron - sized particles suspended in a liquid solution .",
    "each colloidal particle carries an electrostatic charge , leading to a repulsive interaction between the colloids with a range that can be adjusted by varying the salt concentration of the solution .",
    "the colloids can be confined to two dimensions by means of laser trapping , and can interact with quenched disorder which may take the form of optical traps or a structured surface .",
    "to explore noise signatures near a melting transition , we begin with the simplest case of a system confined to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) channel .",
    "such a system can be created artificially by , for example , using an optical trap to confine colloids to a 1d line @xcite , or by nanofabricating channels in a superconducting material , which then serve to confine superconducting vortices @xcite .",
    "quasi-1d confinement of vortices can also arise naturally due to trapping by extended defects such as grain @xcite and twin boundaries @xcite .",
    "additionally , when a tilted field is applied to layered superconductors , vortex chains appear in which a portion of the vortices align in a string with a smaller lattice spacing than that of the bulk vortices @xcite .",
    "we choose to model the vortex chain system as an example of 1d confined melting .",
    "for all of the systems described in this paper , we perform numerical simulations of overdamped particles in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) sample with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 directions . for the vortex chain state , we model the vortices as @xmath2 repulsive particles which interact with weak random quenched disorder and thermal noise .",
    "we confine a portion of the vortices to move along a quasi-1d channel .",
    "the equation of motion for a vortex @xmath3 is @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the damping constant and @xmath6 is the vortex interaction potential , treated as in ref  @xcite .",
    "the pinning potential arises from @xmath7 randomly spaced attractive parabolic traps of range @xmath8 and strength @xmath9 .",
    "the thermal noise @xmath10 arises from random langevin kicks with @xmath11 and @xmath12 we measure temperature in units of the temperature at which the bulk vortices melt , @xmath13 . further details of the simulation can be found in ref  @xcite .    to prepare the system , we place a triangular array of vortices with lattice constant @xmath14 in the sample , and then put additional vortices into the 1d confining channel , so that the lattice constant inside the channel @xmath15 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain1](a ) . in order to accommodate the incommensuration between the vortices in the channel and the surrounding vortex lattice , dislocations form along the channel .",
    "these can be imaged by performing a voronoi tessellation of the sample , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain1](b ) . at low temperatures ,",
    "the incommensuration in the chain is stationary or pinned in a well defined location . as the temperature increases ,",
    "the vortices inside the chain become mobile at temperatures well below the bulk melting transition @xmath16 of the triangular lattice , and begin to move back and forth along the channel , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chain1](c ) .",
    "the transition from localized to mobile vortices inside the channel can be regarded as a 1d melting transition .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we have used noise measurements as a tool to explore the behavior of both thermally melted and dynamically disordered systems in 1d and 2d .",
    "we find that above a threshold , which is a melting transition in the thermal case , and a depinning transition in the driven case , the dynamics of the system becomes highly heterogeneous . in the thermal system ,",
    "domains of ordered particles are surrounded by fluctuating grain boundaries , while in the driven system , regions of pinned particles are surrounded by riverlike filaments of moving particles . in each case , the motion of the particles is not continuous , but is characterized by long periods of no motion followed by a rapid change in position by about a lattice constant .",
    "in contrast , the motion of dislocations or solitons through the system is much more continuous , indicating that the particle motion can be considered as occurring whenever a dislocation goes past .",
    "the power spectrum of a time series of the particle position , particle velocity , or dislocation density has a @xmath17 characteristic in this regime , and the noise power peaks close to melting or depinning . at higher drives or lower temperatures , the system reorders and the noise power drops .",
    "these behaviors are not specific to a particular system , as we have shown here by considering both superconducting vortices as well as colloids in our simulations .",
    "our results suggest that there may be interesting parallels between the heterogeneous nature of the molten phase in the thermal system , and the plastically flowing phase in the driven system .",
