    "the main idea of spintronics - the design and application of devices controlling not only the charge dynamics but also the electron spin evolution - can be useful for information storage , transfer , and manipulation technologies.@xcite possible realizations of spintronics devices can be based on semiconductor nanowires@xcite for quasi - ballistic electron transport , coherent transmission of information , and spin control .",
    "these systems attract a great deal of attention due to a clear interplay of transport and spin - orbit ( so ) coupling physics.@xcite    this control faces the problem of inevitable spin relaxation due to the coupling of electron spin to environment through so coupling . as a result , the factors determining the spin relaxation rate become of crucial importance .",
    "two limiting cases of spin relaxation are well understood .",
    "for the itinerant electrons spin relaxation in mainly determined by the dyakonov - perel mechanism , that is by random precession of electron spin due to the random in time electron momentum .    a different approach should be applied for electrons localized in a regular external potential forming quantum dots promising for quantum information applications.@xcite here momentum is not a well - defined quantity , and the momentum - dependent splitting required for the dyakonov - perel mechanism vanishes . as a result , spin relaxation through so interaction requires phonon - induced coupling of different orbital states of the localized electron and nonzero external magnetic field.@xcite in the absence of magnetic field and spin - orbit coupling , spin relaxation can occur due to the hyperfine coupling of electron spin to spins of lattice nuclei.@xcite in both cases , the initial spin polarization goes asymptotically to zero . the characteristic timescale of spin relaxation of electrons localized in quantum dots is expected to be several orders of magnitude longer than that of itinerant electrons .",
    "while these two limits of free and strongly localized electrons are well understood , the interplay of disorder - induced localization and spin relaxation of itinerant electrons remains an open question although some aspects of the problem have been addressed.@xcite the questions here are ( i ) how the localization forms the spin relaxation , and ( ii ) whether the initially prepared spin density relaxes to zero . as a nontrivial example of this interplay we mention that weak localization of two - dimensional electrons leads to a long power - like rather than exponential spin relaxation.@xcite here we analyze this problem for the one - dimensional system , providing , on one hand , the basic example of localization physics in a random potential,@xcite and , on the other hand , an example of a system , where spin - orbit coupling can be gauged away by a su(2 ) transformation .",

    "the given values follow a universal dependence indicating a unique trend for long - term spins against so coupling and localization through disorder .",
    "this trend corresponds to a fast increase in the asymptotic steady polarization for @xmath112 and a smooth increase and saturation for @xmath113 .",
    "these results can be understood as follows .",
    "to show an efficient spin dynamics , the electron should move the distance of the order of @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , the spatial spread of the corresponding states should be larger than @xmath114 . with a stronger localization , the spread and the overlap decrease leading to the universal behavior shown in fig.[fig : fig7 ] . qualitatively",

    "to summarize , localization effects of disorder and so coupling in semiconductor nanowires determine the dynamics of electronic spins .",
    "our tight - binding model calculations show that a prepared spin density relaxes until reaching a plateau , directly related to the disorder and strength of so interaction .",
    "in contrast to the expected decay to zero , a long - time constant polarization plateau survives to infinite time . the asymptotic spin density has a universal dependence on the product of the inverse participation ratio and the spin precession length . in the absence of magnetic field",
    ", the hyperfine coupling to the spins of nuclei will lead to spin relaxation on timescales at least two orders of magnitude longer than the timescale of the plateau formation of the order of 10 ps.@xcite as the experiments on spin transport did not reveal electron - electron interaction effects,@xcite here we have neglected them . furthermore ,",
    "whether there exists a range of parameters where the coulomb forces can be strong enough to modify our results for localized states , remains to be investigated .",
    "an immediate consequence of this result is the ability , by choosing the desired rashba so parameter for a given wire , to produce and destroy steady spin states , which are of interest for spin - based operations .",
    "these results suggest that semiconductor nanowires can be used for coherent transmission and storage of information , manipulated by spatially and temporally modulated spin - orbit coupling .",
