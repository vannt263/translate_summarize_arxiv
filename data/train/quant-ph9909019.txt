    "in the previous section the spectrum was calculated using _spatial correlation functions at a specific time value_. the traditional method to get the spectrum is to calculate the fourier transform of two time averages of field operators , i.e. use _time correlation functions at a specific point_. for a stationary field the spectrum can be defined as    @xmath55    this definition is valid only for stationary fields .",

    "the resonance frequencies of the atoms are all different    @xmath59    initially all atoms are in the ground state .",

    "the center atom has been able to reflect the resonant radiation to the left and only off - resonant radiation passes the atom .",
    "the fact that resonant radiation is missing is interesting because the second peak of the intensity profile is the result of the atomic decay .",

    "the spectrum of the first peak is quite close to the initial spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the second peak is narrower and is similar to the spectrum of the spontaneous decay .",
    "the fact that the spectrum of the second peak is narrower is understandable because the intensity profile is wider and the interaction time with the detector atoms longer .",
    "the combined spectrum of the two peaks has a dip in the middle , fig .",
    "[ analatomspecleftandrightoneatom ] , whereas the spectra of the peaks measured separately both have a single peak structure .",

    "the correlation function has a more complicated form than the one in fig .",
    "[ corre1and2 ] .",

    "the initial photon is a superposition of ten random gaussian states .",

    "the spectra of the two parts are shown in fig .",

    "because there is not much intensity which would be at resonance with the center atom , the spectrum on the right is similar to the original mode spectrum .",
    "only a small fraction of the intensity is reflected to the left .",
    "both spectra have several peaks .",

    "we showed that the analyzer atom spectrum gives the same result for a resonance fluorescence spectrum of a laser driven three level atom as the physical spectrum defined by eberly and wdkiewicz .",
    "this paper gives further proof that the method really works .",
