    "fusion categories over a field @xmath1 generalize categories of finite group representations ; they are tensor categories with finitely many classes of simple objects , all having duals .",
    "they arise in representation theory@xcite , operator algebras@xcite , topological quantum field theories@xcite , and quantum invariants of @xmath2-manifolds@xcite .",
    "they also play an important role physically in the study of topological quantum computing@xcite and topological phases of matter@xcite .    as such",
    ", a classification of fusion categories up to various notions of equivalence is desirable .",
    "one such notion of equivalence is _ grothendieck equivalence _ , wherein categories have isomorphic decategorifications , which is a based ring in the sense of @xcite .",
    "another notion of equivalence is _ monoidal equivalence _ , wherein categories are related via an invertible monoidal functor .",
    "a natural line of inquiry is then : given a based ring , does it admit categorification ?",
    "if so , given its grothendieck class of fusion categories , how many monoidal classes are there and how can they be distinguished ?",
    "this is an incredibly difficult question to answer in general , especially at the level of fusion categories , with no further assumptions .",
    "most results along these lines are either obtained for small examples which can be easily computed@xcite , but there are some families@xcite for which classifications are known .",
    "in this paper we obtain an answer to these questions for a family of categories we will call metaplectic fusion categories .",
    "these are fusion categories underlying metaplectic modular categories .",
    "recall that a metaplectic modular category@xcite is a modular category grothendieck equivalent to @xmath0 , the category of affine @xmath3 representations with highest integer weight @xmath4@xcite .",
    "other common constructions for such categories come from @xmath5@xcite for @xmath6 some @xmath7 root of unity , or from @xmath8 equivariantizations of @xmath9@xcite where @xmath10 . in (",
    "* theorem 3.2 ) it was shown that all metaplectic modular categories arise from gauging the particle - hole symmetry in @xmath11 modular categories .",
    "our main result is obtained by classifying solutions to the pentagon equations and hexagon equations coming from the @xmath0 based ring .",
    "we stop short of demonstrating that these are all of the categories as this is a much harder problem .",
    "however , the modular data for @xmath0 categories is known and the modular data computed for our solutions coincides . as such , we refine the classification of @xcite one step further .    for fixed @xmath12",
    ", our categories are parameterized by pairs @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 a positive odd integer less than and co - prime to @xmath16 .",
    "let @xmath17 be the set of these @xmath15 .",
    "define @xmath18 with @xmath19 the quotient map .",
    "elements of @xmath20 can be represented as positive integers less than and co - prime to @xmath16 .",
    "likewise , elements of @xmath21 can be represented as positive integers less than or equal to @xmath12 and co - prime to @xmath16 .",
    "particularly , each @xmath22 represents an element of @xmath20 and the action of @xmath21 on @xmath17 via @xmath23 makes sense .",
    "similarly , the evaluation @xmath24 makes sense .",
    "our main result can then be stated as follows    for fixed @xmath12 the following are true :    1 .",
    "the monoidal classes of fusion categories constructed from @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath22 are the fusion categories underlying metaplectic modular categories .",
    "2 .   let @xmath13 and @xmath25 parameterize two different solutions to the pentagon equations .",
    "then the fusion categories constructed from these solutions are monoidally equivalent if and only if @xmath26 and there exists @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "3 .   for @xmath29 , there are exactly @xmath30 monoidally inequivalent metaplectic modular categories if @xmath31 , otherwise there are exactly @xmath32 .    as a sanity check on this , following ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.1 ) , we note that the number of metaplectic fusion categories admitting the structure of a modular category is always less than or equal to the number of metaplectic modular categories .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in [ s : fusion ] we review the basic information for fusion and modular categories and their arithmetic descriptions , fusion and modular systems . in [ s : invs ] we review the gauge invariants of @xcite which allow us to extend deductions about our fusion systems to entire gauge and monoidal classes of fusion categories . in [ s : sost ] we present our solutions to the pentagon and hexagon equations , and construct the modular data . in [ s : equivs ] we determine the monoidal equivalence classes of the fusion categories . in [ s : examples ] we explicitly compute the equivalence classes and modular structures for several examples .",

    "next we have @xmath268 equivalent to @xmath8 and the action of @xmath85 on the objects @xmath221 is determined by @xmath269 @xmath270 the rest of the @xmath33-matrices for the category @xmath262 are given by : @xmath271    there are no other solutions to the pentagon equations for @xmath262 which extend to solutions for @xmath0 .    by @xcite",
    "all fusion categories @xmath65 for @xmath262 are group theoretical and thus morita equivalent to a pointed fusion category @xmath82 of the form @xmath272 where @xmath273 , the group of @xmath16 roots of unity .",

    "the second class of @xmath33-matrices with two labels equal to @xmath223 and @xmath286 is @xmath287 finally , the third class of @xmath33-matrices with two labels equal to @xmath288 or @xmath289 is @xmath290 with these symbols , and the general rules described above , we have exhausted all the @xmath33-matrices .      given our solutions to the pentagon equations , one would anticipate it is not too complicated to construct solutions to the hexagon equations as well .",

    "we then provide only one such solution .",
    "we specify the @xmath17-symbols using a form inspired by conformal field theory .",

    ", we have completely specified one of the solutions of the hexagon equations , from which the other one follows by taking the inverse .",
    "we close by commenting briefly on the appearance of the jacobi symbols in the expression for the @xmath17-symbols .",
    "one can think of the list of hexagon equations as labeled by the different @xmath33-symbols , namely the one appearing on the left hand side of the symbolic form @xmath315 . to derive the form of @xmath316 above , consider the hexagon equation associated to @xmath317 .",
    "the sum on the right hand side gives rise to a quadratic gauss sum ( because one needs to sum over all @xmath221 ( as well as the identity ) ) , which are closely related to the jacobi symbols .",
    "this leads to their presence in the scaling dimensions @xmath316 .",
    "see appendix  [ a : proof ] for more details .    as stated above , the jacobi symbols @xmath318 are defined for positive odd integers @xmath308 and arbitrary integers @xmath307 .",
    "interestingly , we observed that the these jacobi symbols can be written in terms of the matrices @xmath243 and @xmath242 ( whose sizes depend on @xmath12 ) .",
    "in particular , one can show @xmath319 this gives an analytic function of @xmath15 , that goes through all the jacobi symbols , defined for @xmath15 integer .",
    "we note that eisenstein also constructed such a function , @xmath320 , see for instance @xcite . the difference with the function that we found , is that the values @xmath240 are the extrema of the function while this is certainly not the case for eisenstein s function .",
    "all of our f - matrices are manifestly unitary , thus all of our categories admit at least one spherical structure . since they are also braided , they must be ribbon and so we can use the formula .",
    "our formula is defined for any braided category , however one can obtain the more common form by taking @xmath321 .",
    "we present the latter to more easily demonstrate that we obtain the same modular result as @xcite .",
    "however , we also provide an explicit classification at the fusion level .",
    "pivotal structures on modular categories are in bijective correspondence with the group of invertible objects and spherical structures with the maximal abelian 2-subgroup ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 2.4 ) .",
    "since the group of invertible objects is @xmath8 , there are exactly two pivotal structures for each category , both of which are spherical .",
    "it is straightforward to compute that for @xmath69 , @xmath85 , and @xmath221 , all pivotal coefficients must be @xmath235 .",
    "we also have @xmath322 , the choice of which switches the sign of @xmath323 .",
    "below , we present the modular data for solutions with positive quantum dimensions .",
    "it s worth noting that for all @xmath12 and @xmath15 the pivotal coefficients which yield positive quantum dimensions for @xmath324 are not those that yield positive quantum dimensions for @xmath325 .",
    "this can be seen from noting the effect of @xmath326 on . in particular , @xmath327 if we take @xmath328 .",
    "we then have that , for modular categories corresponding to the solution indexed by @xmath296 , @xmath329 for the twists we have @xmath330",
    "in this section we introduce those gauge invariants which we will use to classify monoidally inequivalent solutions for a given @xmath12 using the method of section [ s : invs ] . at the level of gauge equivalence it is easy to see that two solutions @xmath13 and @xmath25 are gauge equivalent if and only if @xmath331 and @xmath332 .",
    "our goal then is to find a set @xmath333 of @xmath131-invariant linear combination of @xmath172-invariant monomials as defined in theorem [ thm : invs ] which determine the monoidal classes .",

    "in this appendix , we briefly explain how we obtained the @xmath33- and @xmath17-symbols that we present in the main text , and how we verified that they indeed are solutions to the pentagon and hexagon equations , for arbitrary tuples @xmath296 with @xmath12 a positive integer , @xmath15 an odd integer such that @xmath457 and @xmath236 , @xmath458 and @xmath430 .",

    "the main difficulty in verifying that the @xmath33- and @xmath17-symbols we obtained do indeed satisfy the pentagon and hexagon equations lies not so much in the actual verification of the equations , but rather in convincing oneself that all the pentagon and hexagon equations one needs to verify are indeed covered .",
    "the reason for this is the structure of the fusion rules of the dimension two objects , which are such that one has to consider many cases separately .",
    "this pertains both to all the possible labelings of the equations , as well as to the sum present in these equations .    in order to complete this task",
    ", we used the algebraic manipulation program _",
    "mathematica_. we first carefully constructed all the pentagon equations that can occur algebraically , that is , for arbitrary tuples @xmath459 . after having convinced ourselves that we indeed covered all the possible cases ,",
    "we then verified this , for low , explicit values of @xmath12 , by using the algebraic result to explicitly construct the labels of all the pentagon equations for these explicit values of @xmath12 . for explicit @xmath12",
    ", one can also generate all possible cases directly . as expected , we indeed covered all the cases .    after we generated all the cases of the pentagon equations for the tuples",
    "@xmath459 , we did the actual verification . in all but one class of equations ,",
    "the equations are straightforwardly verified , and again , we used mathematica for this .",
    "the most complicated cases occur when the sum over @xmath460 in runs over all dimension two objects ( and possibly @xmath69 or @xmath85 ) . to check that the @xmath33-symbols satisfy these equations , one rewrites the ( maximally triple ) products of sines and cosines that occur as a sum of sines and cosines , and one uses lagrange equations to perform the sum .",
    "one can actually use the same procedure to verify that the matrices @xmath172 and @xmath336 , are orthogonal .    to verify that the solutions of the @xmath33- and @xmath17-symbols presented also satisfy the hexagon equations",
    ", we used the same strategy as we used to verify the pentagon equations .",
    "that is , we explicitly constructed all different cases of the hexagon equations using mathematica , which we also used to do the actual checking of the equations , except for the one class of equations , that is non - trivial , and was checked by hand .    the class of equations that we explicitly verified has all the labels @xmath265 of , equal to @xmath223 .",
    "the sum over @xmath461 runs over all dimension two objects , and possibly @xmath462 or @xmath85 .",
    "this class of equations falls apart into four distinct cases , of which we discuss the simplest case for ease of presentation .",
    "the other three cases can be shown to hold using similar arguments .",
    "we first give the four classes of equations ( without simplification ) explicitly .",
    "the first class is @xmath463 the second class is @xmath464 the third class of equations reads @xmath465 finally , the fourth class of equations takes the form @xmath466 these equations hold if @xmath12 is a positive integer , @xmath15 is an odd integer @xmath457 with @xmath236 , @xmath458 and @xmath467 are integer . in the actual hexagon equations one has @xmath468 .",
    "we note that ( and ) is obtained from by setting @xmath469 ( and @xmath470 ) .",
    "we also note that in the right hand side of is a sum of only @xmath12 terms , in comparison to , and , for which the right hand side is a sum of @xmath471 terms .",
    "to verify the validity of , we consider the rhs of this equation first .",
    "replacing @xmath307 by @xmath472 in the summand leaves the summand the same ( if @xmath473 ) , which means we can extend the sum from @xmath474 to @xmath475 at the cost of a factor of two .",
    "the sum can then be split in two pieces , namely in the even @xmath307",
    "s @xmath476 , with @xmath477 and odd @xmath307 s , @xmath478 , with @xmath479 . in both cases , one checks that the summand takes the form @xmath480 , for both @xmath12 even and odd .",
    "hence , the rhs becomes a quadratic gauss sum ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath481 where @xmath482 for @xmath483 ( i.e. , @xmath12 even ) and @xmath484 for @xmath485 ( i.e. , @xmath12 odd ) , and we used that @xmath486 .",
    "standard manipulations of the jacobi - symbol gives + @xmath487 , so that the rhs takes the form @xmath488 we can now compare this result for the rhs of with the lhs , by explicitly checking the lhs for the four different cases of @xmath12 modulo 4 .",
