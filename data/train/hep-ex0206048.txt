    "the energy dependence of the cross section for a given reaction is sensitive to the dominant production mechanism leading to this particular process . in this talk ,",
    "the energy dependence of the cross section for exclusive electroproduction of vector - mesons ( v ) in @xmath2 interactions at hera is discussed .",
    "first , we present an update of an earlier study  @xcite of the universality of v cross sections , scaled by the su(4 ) factors , when plotted as a function of @xmath3  @xcite , where @xmath4 is the virtuality of the photon in the reaction @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the mass of @xmath7 .",
    "the main new ingredient consists of the precise measurements of the @xmath8 cross section  @xcite .",
    "secondly , we investigate the ratios of the v production cross sections , @xmath9 , to the total @xmath10 cross section , @xmath11 , as obtained from the measurements of the @xmath12 structure function of the proton .",
    "the ratios are compared to expectations based on perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and regge approaches .    in order to minimize normalization uncertainties ,",
    "we use for this study only data from the zeus collaboration  @xcite .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that if vector meson cross sections are weighted by the appropriate su(4 ) factor and plotted as function of @xmath14 for fixed values of the variable @xmath0 , all light vs ( @xmath15 ) lie on a universal curve .",
    "however this was not the case for the @xmath8 .",
    "since then , the preliminary zeus @xmath8 photoproduction cross sections have been published  @xcite and new preliminary data on exclusive electroproduction of @xmath8 , covering a wider @xmath14 range , became available  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : su4 ] shows the updated cross sections weighted by the appropriate su(4 ) factors , as function of @xmath14 . for @xmath13 = 9.6 gev@xmath16 ,",
    "the @xmath8 cross sections are about 40% higher than that of the light vs. also at higher scales , where errors are larger , the @xmath8 cross section values lie systematically above those for the @xmath17 .",
    "thus , the updated data confirm the earlier conclusion that there is no simple universality for v production if @xmath3 is used as a scale .",
    "the total @xmath19 cross section , @xmath11 , exhibits a rise with @xmath14 , which becomes steeper with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "it is of interest to compare the @xmath14 dependence of exclusive v production to that of the inclusive cross section . to this end",
    "we study the ratio @xmath20 for each of the vs , as a function of @xmath14 for fixed @xmath4 . before presenting the data we discuss the expectations for @xmath21 using pqcd and regge arguments .      in pqcd",
    ", the forward cross section for longitudinally polarized photons is expected  @xcite to behave as @xmath22 ^ 2 , \\label{eq : brodsky}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the bjorken scaling variable and @xmath24 is the gluon density in the proton .",
    "assuming an exponential @xmath25 behavior of the form @xmath26 , one gets the following expectation @xmath27 in expression  ( [ eq : rvqcd ] ) we have used the fact that both the gluon density distribution and the proton structure function have a similar @xmath28 dependence and that the ratio @xmath29 of the v production cross section induced by longitudinal and transverse virtual photons , @xmath30 , increases with @xmath4 but is @xmath14 independent  @xcite and thus can be neglected .",
    "using regge phenomenology arguments  @xcite , one expects @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the intercept of the pomeron trajectory , and @xmath34 which is the same as  ( [ eq : rvqcd ] ) , if we write @xmath35 .",
    "both in pqcd and regge approaches the ratio @xmath21 rises with @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath14 dependence is not strongly affected by @xmath36 since both for the exclusive electroproduction of @xmath17 and the photoproduction of @xmath8 shrinkage was found to be small  @xcite .",
    "when calculating @xmath21 one has to ensure that both cross sections are taken at the same hard scale . since for @xmath9",
    "the scale is usually chosen as @xmath37 , @xmath38 is calculated at that scale .    the @xmath14 dependence of @xmath21 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rvdata ] for the electroproduction of @xmath17 and @xmath8 , for fixed values of the scale , as indicated in the figure .    while for the @xmath8 case the ratio @xmath39 seems to show the expected rise with @xmath14 , the ratio @xmath40 is independent of @xmath14 , reminiscent of the behavior found in inclusive diffraction at large @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of @xmath40 can not be explained by either pqcd nor by the regge calculations .",
    "following the discussion in section  [ sec : rv ] , it is of interest to study the ratio @xmath41 , as it contains information about the @xmath4 behavior in the pqcd approach as well as about the slope @xmath36 , in both approaches .      in order to calculate the pqcd expectations for @xmath41 , we include also the terms having a @xmath4 dependence and obtain @xmath42 this comes about since @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath45 is negligible .",
    "thus , if one neglects the @xmath4 variation of @xmath46 in the @xmath4 range discussed in this paper , @xmath47 and , apart from some numerical @xmath14-independent factor , one obtains the slope @xmath36 .",
    "[ fig : bqcd ] shows the ratio  ( [ eq : bqcd ] ) for the @xmath17 and for the @xmath8 mesons .    while in the case of @xmath17 one",
    "sees a slight @xmath4 dependence of the ratio , the ratio is @xmath4 independent for the @xmath8 .",
    "this result is in agreement with what is known from direct measurements of the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath36 for both vs  @xcite .    reversing the argument , especially in the @xmath8 case , where the lack of @xmath4 dependence of @xmath36 is known , fig .",
    "[ fig : bqcd ] reflects the behavior of the propagator term , @xmath48 , in @xmath9 , as expected in pqcd or pqcd - inspired models .",
    "one can use the optical theorem , together with the vector dominance model ( vdm )  @xcite , to obtain the following relation : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the strength of the direct @xmath51-@xmath17 coupling .",
    "this relation assumes @xmath52-dominance , which is a good assumption as the @xmath17 contributes @xmath53 85% to the vdm relation . if @xmath36 is measured in units of gev@xmath54 , and a value of 0.5  @xcite is used for the @xmath51-@xmath17 coupling , one obtains from eq .",
    "( [ eq : opt ] ) @xmath55    fig .",
    "[ fig : bvdm ] shows the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bvdm ] ) , as function of @xmath14 , for fixed values of the scale .    for the @xmath17 photoproduction data , after correcting for the assumed @xmath52-dominance ,",
    "one gets good agreement with the value measured  @xcite .",
    "while the @xmath14 dependence is consistent with the slight shrinkage measured  @xcite , the resulting values at higher scales come out much too high and increase with the scale , contrary to direct measurements  @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising since in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bvdm ] ) we have used the value of the direct @xmath51-@xmath17 coupling at @xmath4=0 .",
    "in fact , the direct coupling is @xmath4 dependent , and can be expressed as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the @xmath51-@xmath17 form - factor .",
    "one can use the measured values of @xmath36  @xcite to calculate the form - factor using eq .",
    "( [ eq : opt ] ) , @xmath58    fig .",
    "[ fig : ff ] shows the resulting values of the @xmath51-@xmath17 form - factor , as function of @xmath4 .",
    "a function of the form @xmath59 was fitted to the data , resulting in the parameters @xmath60 gev@xmath16 , and @xmath61 . to restore a good agreement with measurements ,",
    "a @xmath62 dependence has to be introduced through the form - factor .",
    "we can summarize the results of this study as follows :    * the su(4)-weighted cross sections of the light vector mesons lie on a universal curve when plotted at a scale of @xmath13 .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath8 meson . *",
    "the ratio of the cross section of exclusive @xmath17 electroproduction to that of the total @xmath19 one is @xmath14 independent , for fixed values of @xmath4 .",
    "this behavior can not be explained by either the pqcd nor by the regge phenomenology approaches .",
    "the ratio rises with @xmath14 for the @xmath8 vector meson , consistent with the expectations . *",
    "the ratio @xmath41 shows the @xmath48 dependence predicted by pqcd for the vs cross section .",
    "this ratio also provides an indirect way to learn about the @xmath14 and @xmath4 behavior of the slope @xmath36 . * in order to make the vdm approach agree with the data , one would need to introduce a @xmath51-@xmath17 form factor which has a @xmath62 dependence .",
