    "a wide variety of techniques have been proposed to model multiphase fluid systems with incompressible , immiscible fluids .",
    "these include explicit front - tracking techniques @xcite , the volume - of - fluid method @xcite , the phase - field method @xcite , and the level set method @xcite .",
    "a constant challenge in each of these techniques is the conservation of mass during the course of the simulation .",
    "each of these methods handle this challenge differently .",
    "for example , the volume - of - fluid methods has excellent mass conservation properties @xcite at the expense of requiring complex heuristic interface reconstructions techniques to calculate geometric quantities such as curvature @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there are many physical systems where high accuracy of geometric quantities are required .",
    "one example are models of liposome vesicles where interfacial forces depend on high order derivatives of the interface s curvature @xcite . unlike volume - of - fluid techniques , front tracking , phase - field , and level - set methods are able to provide higher geometric accuracy .",
    "this accuracy is obtained at the expense of natural volume conservation and thus special care must be taken to ensure that mass does not change over the course of a simulation .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to improve the mass conservation of such methods . for example , level set methods have been adjusted by lagrangian particles which are used to correct the level set function @xcite or level sets have been combined with volume of fluid methods @xcite .",
    "other simply shift the interface function to match the volume constraint @xcite .",
    "the major issue with these types of corrections is that the interface becomes decoupled from the underlying flow field . as an example consider an interface on a uniform cartesian grid , fig .",
    "[ fig : velocitydecouple ] .",
    "the interface begins on the left side and the underlying fluid flow - field dictates that it should move to the right one grid spacing .",
    "after this time step it is determined that errors in the simulation resulted in a mass gain .",
    "a simple and often - used correction is to simply move the interface to obtain mass conservation . in this case",
    "the effect is the interface will not move the full amount that the underlying flow field dictates .",
    "the movement of the interface and the underlying flow field have become decoupled .",
    "any externally applied correction for front - tracking , phase - field or level set methods will demonstrate similar behavior .        in this manuscript",
    "a different approach is taken .",
    "instead of adjusting the interface to achieve mass conservation a novel navier - stokes projection method is developed which ensures mass conservation .",
    "unlike the previous method the interface is simply advected due to the underlying flow - field , it is the flow - field itself which explicitly takes into account any possible mass - loss . as will become apparent later in the manuscript",
    "it is useful to think of this method as modifying the pressure so that it can handle not only local incompressibility but also global mass conservation .",
    "note that while this manuscript will focus on a particular navier - stokes numerical implementation , the concept presented here extends to any type of multiphase fluid simulation that uses a projection method .",
    "the remainder of the manuscript is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : single - fluid ] the single - fluid formulation of multiphase fluid flow is briefly described .",
    "the novel mass - preserving navier - stokes projection method is described in section [ sec : projection - method ] .",
    "the numerical implementation is given in section [ sec : numerics ] , which is followed by numerical experiments in section [ sec : experiments ] .",
    "a short conclusion is presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this sections a brief introduction to the single - fluid formulation of multiphase fluid flow is presented . in a multiphase fluid system",
    "the interface between two immiscible fluids evolves over time . in this work",
    "a level - set description of the interface is used .",
    "let the evolving interface be given as the set of points where the level - set function is zero , @xmath0 .",
    "the evolution of the level set function @xmath1 over time will implicitly determine the location of the interface .",
    "following convention the interior fluid , @xmath2 , is given by @xmath3 while the outer fluid , @xmath4 , is given by @xmath5 , fig .",
    "[ fig : levelset ] .",
    "the entire domain is given as @xmath6 .",
    "using the level - set description it is possible to obtain geometric information of the interface easily .",
    "for example , the outward facing normal is simply @xmath7 while the total curvature can be calculated as @xmath8 .        in each domain",
    "the navier - stokes equations hold , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fluid density , @xmath11 is the fluid viscosity and @xmath12 is any body force term , such as gravity .",
    "the fluid equations are coupled by a jump in the stress at the interface , @xmath13\\cdot{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{n}}={\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{f } } ,      \\label{eq : interfacejump}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 $ ] indicates the jump of a quantity ( outside minus inside ) across the interface and @xmath15 are any forces , such as tension , which act on the interface .",
    "a difficulty in multiphase fluid simulations is the solution of this set of coupled but discontinuous differential equations . some techniques , such as the immersed interface method @xcite , augment the discretization of the differential equations to take into account the jumps across the interface .",
    "another technique , which is explained here , is to model the domain as a  single \" fluid with spatially varying properties @xcite .",
    "the interface condition , eq . ( [ eq : interfacejump ] ) , is accounted for by converting the singular force contribution at the interface into a body - force term localized around the interface .",
    "define the smooth heaviside , @xmath16 , function as @xmath17 & |\\phi|\\leq \\varepsilon \\\\          1 & \\phi>\\varepsilon      \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is proportional to the grid spacing . from the definition of the heaviside function",
    "define the smoothed dirac - delta function as @xmath19 , @xmath20 & |\\phi|\\leq \\varepsilon      \\end{cases}.\\ ] ] the use of the heaviside and dirac functions allows for the calculation of the volume enclosed by a given level set as well as the surface area as a integrals over the domain , @xmath21    using the heaviside function the density and viscosity are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "these functions also allow for the transformation of singular interface forces into localized body force terms .",
    "for example , let the only singular interfacial force be from a uniform surface tension , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the coefficient of surface tension . in conjunction with the smoothed density and viscosity definitions",
    "this results in a single navier - stokes equation valid in the entire domain , @xmath26 where the body force term has been written as a smooth function of the level - set .",
    "this type of single - fluid formulation for multiphase flow has been used to model bubbles and droplets @xcite and vesicles @xcite .",
    "the results below focus on bubbles and droplets under the influence of surface tension and gravity .",
    "therefore , the interface and body force are restricted to this particular case .",
    "the dimensionless form of the single - fluid navier - stokes equations can be obtained by defining a characteristic length @xmath27 , and velocity @xmath28 , from which a characteristic time can be obtained , @xmath29 .",
    "the density and viscosity are normalized by the values of the outer domain , @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the density and viscosity ratio , respectively , and the @xmath18 has been dropped for clarity .",
    "define the the reynolds number as @xmath33 the weber number as @xmath34 and the froude number as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the strength of gravity pointing in the @xmath37 direction .",
    "the navier - stokes equations now become @xmath38 note that in this particular formulation gravity is written as @xmath39 so that uniform acceleration of the entire domain does not occur .",
    "projection methods are a common technique to solve the navier - stokes equations @xcite . in such schemes a tentative velocity field is first determined and then the pressure is calculated to enforce the local volume conservation .",
    "in addition to conservation of local volume , eq .",
    "( [ eq : singlediv ] ) , it would be advantageous to explicitly enforce global volume conservation .",
    "even if local volume conservation is performed exactly errors in the advection of the interface can introduce unwanted volume change over the course of a simulation . in this novel projection method both local and global volume conservation are enforced .",
    "the first step is to determine a tentative velocity field at time @xmath40 in the absence of the pressure and forces . in this work",
    "the semi - lagrangian formulation is used : @xmath41 the departure velocity , @xmath42 , for a grid point @xmath43 is determined by tracing characteristics backward in time , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an interpolant of the velocity field at time @xmath46 . additional information regarding the semi - lagrangian method for navier - stokes equations is given in ref @xcite .",
    "the next step of a standard projection method would be to determine the pressure to satisfy local volume conservation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : singlediv ] ) . in this work global conservation",
    "is also considered .",
    "global volume conservation can be enforced by looking at the rate at which the enclosed volume , @xmath47 , will change over time @xcite",
    "@xmath48 for an outward facing unit normal , @xmath49 , to the interface @xmath50 .",
    "unfortunately , the pressure field alone can not satisfy both constraints .",
    "therefore the pressure is split into a constant and spatially - varying component : @xmath51 the constant pressure component , @xmath52 , only has a contribution to the overall pressure field in the region given by @xmath3 and can be thought of enforcing global volume conservation .",
    "the spatially - varying component , @xmath53 , takes the place of the standard pressure and will be used to enforce local volume conservation . expanding the pressure component results in @xmath54 which demonstrates that @xmath52 only has a contribution near the interface .    using this definition of pressure",
    "the projection step is now @xmath55 for quantities localized around the interface the average density is used , @xmath56 .    to determine @xmath53 and @xmath52 both conservation conditions",
    "are applied to the projection step , eq .",
    "( [ eq : projection ] ) . applying local conservation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : singlediv ] ) , results in @xmath57 global conservation can be enforced by combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : globalconservation ] ) and ( [ eq : projection ] ) and also requiring that the time - evolution of the volume be such that any previous errors are corrected , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the initial enclosed volume .",
    "let @xmath60 represent the vector holding the the values of @xmath53 over the entire discretized domain .",
    "the surface integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : globalsolve ] ) can be written as a summation over a discretized domain , @xmath61 where grid points are given by @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the function value at the grid points , and @xmath65 is the volume of each cell surrounding a grid point .",
    "it is then possible to define the following linear operators : @xmath66 the two constraint equations , eqs .",

    "( [ eq : globalsolve ] ) .",
    "this particular block matrix form can be solved efficiently through the use of a schur decomposition , @xmath70 the schur complement is a rank-1 update on the matrix @xmath71 : @xmath72 which has an inverse given by the sherman - morrison formula , @xmath73 so long as @xmath74 is non - zero the inverse is defined .",
    "this condition is not proven here , but a check is performed during all simulations and has never been violated .",

    "the particular discretization used in the numerical experiments below will be discussed in sec .",

    "in this section the particular numerical implementation used in the numerical experiments of sec . [",
    "sec : experiments ] is briefly discussed . in particular the description and advection of the interface and the discretization of the projection method",
    "is presented .",
    "the interface separating the multiple fluid phases is described here using a gradient - augmented level set method @xcite . in this extension of the level",
    "set method the gradient field of the level set is explicitly tracked in addition to the level set function .",
    "this allows for the accurate determination of interfacial quantities such as curvature @xcite .",
    "in particular the results shown below use a recent semi - implicit extension of the original level set jet scheme @xcite .    consider the implicit tracking of an interface by way of a level set function : @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to the level set also track the gradient field of the level set , @xmath75 .",
    "this allows for the determination of hermite interpolants using only information local to a cell on a cartesian grid @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the original jet scheme does not work well for stiff advection equations , such as those involving surface tension , and the recent semijet method was developed in response @xcite .",
    "the semijet method begins by performing a semi - implicit , semi - lagrangian update on the level set field , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the level set value at the departure location and @xmath78 is a constant . to update the gradient field note that the smoothing operation can be captured using a smoothing operator , @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are both known at grid points after solving eq .",

    "sub - grid points an updated level - set value is obtained using an explicit semi - lagrangian update with the smoothing source term given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : semijet - source ] ) , @xmath87 once the level set values on the subgrid are calculated updated gradient values at grid points can be obtained using finite difference approximations .",
    "for example , in two - dimensions the gradient in the @xmath88-direction at a grid is given by @xmath89 .",
    "curvature values are calculated at grid points using @xmath90 in two - dimensions with a similar expression for three - dimensions .",
    "the values used to calculate the curvature were calculated by averaging derivatives .",
