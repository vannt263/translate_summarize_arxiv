    "the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( _ wise _ , wright et al .",
    "2010 ) has significantly advanced the study of brown dwarfs , stellar - like objects that have insufficient mass for stable hydrogen burning ( kumar 1963 , hayashi & nakano 1963 ) . about the size of jupiter , the cool brown dwarfs are intrinsically very faint .",
    "prior to _ wise _ , brown dwarfs as cool as @xmath4  k had been found in near - infrared surveys undertaken by 4@xmath5m - class ground - based telescopes ( e.g. lucas et al .",
    "two brown dwarfs were also known with @xmath6  k : cfbdsir j145829 + 101343b , a companion to a warmer brown dwarf , discovered using laser guide star adaptive optics imaging ( liu et al .",
    "2011 ) , and gj 3483b , a companion to a white dwarf , found using the infrared array camera on the _ spitzer telescope _ in a proper motion search for faint companions ( luhman , burgasser & bochanski 2011 ) .",
    "these 400  k brown dwarfs were expected to have a later spectral type than all previously known t dwarfs .",
    "observations beyond the near - infrared , such as those obtained with the _ spitzer telescope _ , are advantageous for studying cool brown dwarfs because objects with @xmath7  k emit @xmath8% of their energy at @xmath9 @xmath0 m ( leggett et al .",
    "in 2011 the mid - infrared 0.4@xmath5 m _ wise _ telescope identified the first large sample of brown dwarfs with @xmath10  k ( cushing et al .",
    "2011 , kirkpatrick et al . 2011 and 2012 ) .",
    "kirkpatrick et al .",
    "( 2011 ) presented the first hundred _ wise _ brown dwarfs and this paper studies one of those objects , wisepc j121756.91 + 162640.2 ( hereafter wise 1217@xmath1116 ) , which was classified as a t9 spectral type by kirkpatrick et al .",
    "wise 1217@xmath1116 was found to be a binary system by liu et al .",
    "( 2012 , hereafter liu12 ) using keck laser guide star adaptive optics .",
    "the pair is separated by @xmath12 at a position angle of 14.3@xmath13 .",
    "it is an unusual binary , having a relatively wide separation and a large difference in near - infrared brightness between the two components ( see table 1 ) .",
    "liu12 obtained resolved @xmath14-band spectra of the two components and classified wise 1217@xmath1116a as a t9 and wise 1217@xmath1116b as a y0 , using the spectral classification scheme for the latest t - type and early y - type brown dwarfs proposed by cushing et al .",
    "( 2011 ) . here",
    "we present resolved spectra for the system covering a wider wavelength range of 0.9  2.5 @xmath0 m and expand on the analysis presented by liu12 .",
    "we used the gemini near - infrared spectrograph ( gnirs , elias et al .",
    "2006 ) to obtain 0.9  2.5 @xmath0 m cross - dispersed spectra of wise 1217@xmath1116ab via queue program gn-2012b - q-28 . in order to resolve the pair ,",
    "observations were carried out only when the natural seeing full width half maximum ( fwhm ) was @xmath15 or better and only at airmasses less than 1.2 . both photometric and cloudy",
    "conditions were utilised .",
    "the @xmath16 slit was used with the @xmath17 pixel@xmath18 camera , resulting in a resolving power @xmath19 .",
    "the slit was placed at 14.3@xmath13 so that both sources were in the slit .",
    "individual exposure times of 300 seconds were used , with the target nodded along the slit . the a0 star hd 101060 and",
    "the f4 star hd 114072 were used as calibrators to remove telluric features .",
    "observations were obtained on 2013 february 21 , april 9 , april 26 and may 8 ut . time on source on these nights was 35 , 40 , 60 and 60 minutes , respectively .",
    "the data from 2013 february 21 were obtained in thicker cloud cover , and as the signal was around half that of the three other nights those data were omitted .",
    "calibration lamps on the telescope provided data for wavelength calibration and flat fielding , as well as pinhole images for tracing the cross - dispersed data along the detector .",
    "figure 1 shows the flat fielded , sky - subtracted and rectified @xmath20-band spectrum from 2013 may 8 as a two - dimensional image .",
    "the fwhm is around 2 pixels ( @xmath16 ) and the separation between components is 5 pixels ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the spectrum of both the a and b components were extracted using apertures centered at the respective peaks , with a lower limit of @xmath21 pixels and an upper limit of 2.5 pixels .",
    "where b is extremely faint , we used the known offset from a to place the aperture .",
    "the contribution of the brighter component to the fainter component s spectrum was determined by extracting the signal of the a component at the location of the b components aperture on the opposite side of the profile .",
    "typically the contribution was 5% of the signal of the a component , and 20% of that of the b component . to avoid",
    "adding noise , we subtracted an appropriately scaled version of the a spectrum from the b spectrum , and not the spectrum extracted from the wing .",
    "the spectral orders for each component were combined , averaging the regions of overlap at 0.98  0.95 , 0.98  1.06 , 1.13  1.25 , 1.45  1.52 , 1.88  1.90 @xmath0 m .",
    "each spectrum was flux - calibrated using the photometry presented in liu12 .",
    "the final spectrum for each component was constructed by averaging each night s data .",
    "based on the scatter between the three measurements , the uncertainty in the flux for the a component is 7% over the @xmath22-band peak , 5% over the @xmath20-band peak , 7% over the @xmath14-band peak , and 15% over the @xmath23-band peak .",
    "similarly for the b component the uncertainty in the flux is 20% over the @xmath22-band peak , 15% over the @xmath20-band peak , 10% over the @xmath14-band peak , and 60% over the @xmath23-band peak ( where there is very little flux ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the spectrum of each component derived here , together with a comparison of the summed spectrum to the spectrum of the unresolved pair presented by kirkpatrick et al .",
    "the inset plot compares our @xmath14-band sections to the resolved spectra obtained previously at keck by liu12 .",
    "the agreement with the keck data is excellent , and that with the unresolved spectrum is reasonable , given the noise in each measurement .",
    "these comparisons validate our extraction of the one - dimensional spectra from the two - dimensional images .",
    "figure 3 compares our spectrum of wise 1217@xmath1116a and wise 1217@xmath1116b to t and y dwarfs classified by cushing et al .",
    "( 2011 ) as t8.5 , t9 , y0 and y0.5 .",
    "the comparison spectra have been scaled to the @xmath20-band flux peak of each component .",

    "it is clear visually that wise 1217@xmath1116a is an excellent match to the t8.5 reference , and has a wider @xmath20-band flux peak than the t9 .",
    "however wise 1217@xmath1116a is much fainter at @xmath23 than either reference source , which we discuss in the following paragraph .",
    "we classify wise 1217@xmath1116a as t8.5 .",
    "the wise 1217@xmath1116b comparison is less straightforward .",
    "the blue side of the @xmath20-band flux peak matches the y0.5 template , however the red side is in better agreement with the y0 template .",
    "both the blue and red sides of the @xmath20-band peak are impacted by absorption by ch@xmath24 , h@xmath25o and nh@xmath26 ; the blue side is also affected by pressure - induced h@xmath25 absorption ( e.g. figure 1 of leggett et al . 2009 ) .",
    "it is likely that metallicity and gravity , as well as temperature , impact the shape of the @xmath20-band peak and that we are seeing variations in these parameters for the three y dwarfs .",
    "the fact that the @xmath23-band is suppressed for wise 1217@xmath1116a implies that it either has a high gravity or low metallicity which enhances the h@xmath25 absorption at 2 @xmath0 m ( e.g. leggett et al .",
    "2009 ) ; possibly we are also seeing enhanced h@xmath25 absorption in the blue wing of the @xmath20-band peak .",
    "we define wise 1217@xmath1116b as y0  0.5 .",
    "note that the near - infrared spectra of these components , which straddle the current t / y classification boundary , are overall very similar",
    ". increased molecular absorption narrows the flux peaks at lower @xmath27 , but there is otherwise no strong spectral marker for the transition from t to y in the near infrared .",
    "one difference that is apparent is the height and width of the @xmath22-band peak around 1 @xmath0 m  relative to the @xmath20-band peak , the later spectral type and cooler object has a taller and broader @xmath22-band peak .",
    "this is also seen in the @xmath28 colors , which become bluer .",
    "figure 4 is the @xmath28,@xmath29 color - magnitude diagram , showing the trend to bluer @xmath28 .",
    "also , this figure shows about half the drop in absolute magnitude between t9 and y0 than is seen for @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( dupuy & kraus 2013 , figure 5 and  4.3 ) . for t9 types with",
    "@xmath32  k , the alkali elements are condensing into chlorides and sulfides , weakening the strong @xmath33 m k i resonance doublet , the red wing of which suppresses the @xmath22-band flux .",
    "this likely explains the brightening at @xmath22 ( liu12 , leggett et al .",
    "there is a lot of scatter in the @xmath28 colors of early y dwarfs ( figure 4 ) , again suggesting that there are variations in metallicity and gravity , as well as temperature , within this small sample .",
    "this disparity can also be seen spectroscopically in figure 3 : wise 1217@xmath1116b has a broader @xmath22-band peak than the comparison y dwarfs and is bluer in @xmath28 .    the gap in @xmath29 and @xmath31 at the t to y transition is striking in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "this gap is not seen at mid - infrared wavelengths ( leggett et al 2013 , hereafter leg13 ; dupuy & kraus 2013 ) .",
    "the gap may disappear as more very late - type t and y dwarfs are found and more distances are determined but it is tempting to associate the distinct drop in flux at 1  2 @xmath0 m at @xmath6  k with a physical phenomenon .",
    "possibilities include the appearance of water clouds or the impact of a newly significant opacity such as h@xmath25 .",
    "improved models are required to explore this further .",
    "finally we note that the object initially identified as the prototype y dwarf , wisep j182831.08 + 265037.8 ( cushing et al . 2011 ) , appears to be different from the other y dwarfs in terms of colors and luminosity (  4.3 , beichman et al .",
    "2013 , dupuy & kraus 2013 , leg13 , kirkpatrick et al .",
    "once a larger sample of y dwarfs is known it is likely that the spectral classification scheme will have to be revisited .",
    "also as the models are improved with more complete treatment of opacities , clouds and turbulence , we hope to disentangle the effects of temperature , metallicity and gravity on the near - infrared spectrum of these cold objects .",
    "leg13 compares near - infrared photometry to cloud - free models and to a new generation of models that include clouds consisting of sulfide and chloride condensates ; we use the same models here .",
    "the cloud - free model atmospheres are as described in saumon & marley ( 2008 ) and marley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , with updates to the line list of nh@xmath26 and of the collision - induced absorption of h@xmath25 as described in saumon et al .",
    "the cloudy models are described in detail in morley et al .",
    "morley et al . have added absorption and scattering by condensates of cr , mns , na@xmath25s , zns and kcl to the cloud - free models .",
    "these condensates have been predicted to be present in low-@xmath27 atmospheres by lodders ( 1999 ) and visscher , lodders & fegley ( 2006 ) .",
    "morley et al .",
    "use the ackerman & marley ( 2001 ) cloud model to account for these previously neglected clouds . the vertical cloud extent",
    "is determined by balancing upward turbulent mixing and downward sedimentation .",
    "a parameter @xmath34 describes the efficiency of sedimentation , and is the ratio of the sedimentation velocity to the convective velocity ; lower values of @xmath34 imply thicker ( i.e. more vertically extended ) clouds .",
    "we have found that models that include iron and silicate grains and which have @xmath34 of typically 2  3 fit l dwarf spectra well , those with @xmath34 2  4 fit t0 to t3 spectral types well , and cloud - free models fit t4  t8 types well ( e.g. saumon & marley 2008 , stephens et al",
    "however for the latest t - types significant discrepancies exist between the models and the observations , in the near - infrared ( e.g. leggett et al .",
    "2009 , 2012 ) . the new models with the chloride and sulfide clouds help to resolve these discrepancies , because these clouds are significant for dwarfs with @xmath35  900  k ( approximately t7 to y1 spectral types ) , with a peak impact at around 600  k. below @xmath36 water clouds are expected to form ( burrows , sudarsky & lunine 2003 ) , which have not yet been incorporated into the models ( although water condensation is accounted for in the gas opacity ) .",
    "the models used in the present analysis have solar metallicity and neglect departures from chemical equilibrium caused by vertical mixing .",
    "the mixing enhances the abundance of co and co@xmath25 and reduces the 5 @xmath0 m flux ( saumon et al .",
    "vertical mixing also decreases the abundance of nh@xmath26 , which would otherwise produce stronger absorption features at 1.03 and 1.52 @xmath0 m than are seen in the known y dwarfs ( leg13 ) .",
    "the mixing can be parameterized with the eddy diffusion coefficient @xmath37 @xmath38 s@xmath18 , where values of log @xmath39  6 corresponding to mixing timescales of @xmath40 yr to @xmath41 hr , respectively , reproduce the observations of t dwarfs ( e.g. saumon et al .",

    "( 2012 ) find that the @xmath42  k dwarf ugps j0722@xmath430540 is undergoing vigorous mixing , with log @xmath44  6.0 , and this impacts the _ wise _ 4.6 @xmath0 m w2 band by @xmath45 magnitude .",
    "leg13 find that increasing the calculated w2 flux by 0.3 magnitude results in the model sequences reproducing the observed color trends in t and y dwarfs quite well .",
    "liu12 derived a photometric distance of 10.5 @xmath46 pc for wise 1217@xmath1116a based on a spectral type assignment of t9 and a @xmath20-band bolometric correction for very late - type t dwarfs .",
    "the luminosity was combined with evolutionary models to derive physical properties for ages of 1 gyr and 5 gyr . for the younger age the inferred @xmath27 and mass",
    "are 550  k and 13 @xmath2 for the primary , and 400  k and 7 @xmath2 for the secondary . for the older age these values are 650  k and 33 @xmath2 for the primary , and 400  k and 17 @xmath2 for the secondary .",
    "dupuy & kraus ( 2013 ) have recently published a trigonometric distance to the binary of @xmath47pc . using this distance and model - based bolometric corrections to the summed observed flux given by the measured magnitudes , they determine , for an age of 5 gyr , @xmath27 and mass of 600  k and 31 @xmath2 for the primary , and 450  k and 19 @xmath2 for the secondary .    leg13 compare the observed resolved near - infrared colors of the wise 1217@xmath1116 components to the morley et al .",
    "( 2012 ) cloudy models .",
    "the w2 magnitudes for each component are estimated based on spectral type , constrained by the unresolved w2 value .",
    "leg13 find that the model sequences are consistent with a single - age solution for the binary .",
    "higher gravity solutions , corresponding to an age @xmath485 gyr , provided better fits than the lower gravity corresponding to 1 gyr , because of the relatively blue @xmath3 color .",
    "the colors also suggested that the atmospheres of both components had thin cloud layers with @xmath49 .    the proper motion for the binary is measured to be @xmath50 yr@xmath18 ( dupuy & kraus 2013 ) , implying a tangential velocity of @xmath51 km s@xmath18 .",
    "this velocity implies kinematics intermediate between the thin and thick disk populations ( e.g. brook et al .",
    "2012 ; dupuy & liu 2012 ) and therefore an age around 7 gyr .",
    "this result is consistent with the findings of leg13 , that the higher gravity and therefore older age of 5 gyr is favored over the younger 1 gyr age .",

    "the impact of the lower metallicity is clearly seen in the @xmath3 color in figure 5 , which also suggests that the wise 1217@xmath1116 system may be slightly metal poor . if , instead , the blue @xmath3 is due to gravity only , the size of the shift ( @xmath57 magnitudes ) implies a gravity @xmath58 dex higher than typical for the type ( e.g. burningham et al .",

    "large is unlikely , given that at @xmath52  k an increase in age from 1 to 10 gyr corresponds to an increase in gravity of 0.6 dex ( saumon & marley 2008 , their figure 4 ) .",
    "hence we suggest that the system has a relatively high gravity combined with a metallicity of about @xmath59 dex .",
    "it can be seen that the absolute @xmath14 magnitudes for the wise 1217@xmath1116 components are consistent with the assigned spectral types of t8.5 and y00.5 . using the previous studies of late t and early y dwarfs",
    ", the figure suggests that the components have @xmath60  600@xmath5k and 400  450@xmath5k , respectively , which is also consistent with previous determinations (  4.2 ) .",
    "table 2 gives physical parameters for each component for these values of @xmath27 , for a range in age of 4 gyr to 10 gyr , calculated using the evolutionary models of saumon & marley ( 2008 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows the spectrum of each component and synthetic spectra generated by the morley et al .",
    "( 2012 ) models .",
    "the spectra have been scaled by the known distance to the binary ( table 1 ) , and the radius of each component as given by the evolutionary models for an age of 6 gyr ( table 2 ) .",
    "if the system is younger the radius is larger and the synthetic spectrum would be brighter , and vice versa . for ages of 2 and 4 gyr the scaling factor is 20% and 8% larger , while for ages of 8 and 10 gyr the factor is 6% and 8% smaller , respectively .",
    "strictly , if @xmath27 is kept constant and radius changed then gravity also changes , which would impact the spectral energy distribution .",
    "however for the purpose of constraining the model by the luminosity , the gravity impact is small .",
    "for example , if @xmath4  k , and age is 6 gyr , then radius and gravity are @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "if @xmath63  k , and age is 10@xmath5gyr , then radius and gravity are 0.0896@xmath64 and @xmath65 ( saumon & marley 2008 ) . the spectral change due to a change in gravity of 0.14 dex is small ( e.g. leggett et al . 2009 ) , while the change in the flux scaling factor ( @xmath66 ) of 10% is significant .",
    "another factor to bear in mind when examining figure 6 is that the models do not include the vertical mixing that likely occurs in such atmospheres ( e.g. leg13 ,  4.1 ) .",
    "the mixing is expected to increase the abundance of n@xmath25 at the expense of that of nh@xmath26 . in the near - infrared",
    "this affects the @xmath14-band in particular ; the nh@xmath26 absorption is much reduced , making the blue wing and peak of the @xmath14-band brighter .",
    "the effect is @xmath48 20% at the peak of the @xmath14-band at these temperatures ( based on preliminary saumon & marley models ) .",
    "the model comparison in figure 6 and the relative strengths of the @xmath22 , @xmath20 and @xmath14 peaks ( @xmath23 is very faint ) suggests that each component of the wise 1217@xmath1116 binary has very thin to no sulfide / chloride clouds : @xmath67 .",
    "the brightness of the flux peaks , especially considering that the @xmath14 peak is likely to be brighter when mixing is included , suggests that the age is unlikely to be less than 4 gyr , as the model spectra will then be too bright",
    ". the system may be as old as 10 gyr , as shown in the inset in figure 6 , although there is a discrepancy at @xmath20 for the b component in that case .",
    "enhanced h@xmath25 absorption , if the system is metal poor , could reduce the flux at @xmath23 , and possibly at the blue wing of @xmath20 for the cooler dwarf , improving the fit .",
    "the relative height of the flux peaks are likely to also be sensitive to the detailed structure of any cloud decks , as is seen at the l / t dwarf transition ( e.g. marley et al .",
    "2012 , apai et al .",
    "2013 ) . in summary ,",
    "plausible fits are obtained for an age range of 4 to 8 gyr .    for the a component the best match to the models occurs if @xmath68  ( k ) @xmath69 and there are no clouds . for the b component",
    "the best match to the models occurs if @xmath70  k and there are no clouds or an extremely thin sulfide / chloride cloud layer with @xmath71 .",
    "other spectral comparisons ( not shown ) , where the synthetic spectra are scaled by the known distance and the evolutionary - determined radius , showed that we can exclude @xmath27 values of 500  k for either the a or b component , due to large discrepancies in brightness levels .",
    "similarly temperatures as high as 650  k can be excluded for wise 1217@xmath1116a .",
    "although we do not have 350  k model spectra , luminosity arguments ( see figure 5 and dupuy & kraus 2013 , their table s5 ) show that wise 1217@xmath1116b can not be as cool as 350  k.    table 3 summarises the likely values for the physical properties for the system .",
    "we have used nights of excellent seeing on mauna kea to obtain resolved 0.9  2.3 @xmath0 m spectra for the t dwarf and y dwarf binary wisepc j121756.91@xmath11162640.2ab .",
    "the spectral extraction is confirmed to be accurate by comparison to the unresolved spectrum and resolved @xmath14-band spectra obtained previously .",
    "comparison to the near - infrared spectra of ( the small number of ) very late - type t dwarfs and early - type y dwarfs implies spectral types of t8.5 and y0  y0.5 for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "thus the system straddles the currently defined t / y spectral type boundary .    using synthetic spectra generated by model atmospheres that include chloride and sulfide clouds ( morley et al .",
    "2012 ) , and constrained by the distance to the system ( dupuy & kraus 2013 ) and the radius of each component based on evolutionary models ( saumon & marley 2008 ) , we can determine a probable range of physical properties for the binary .",
    "the effective temperature of the primary is 550  600  k , and that of the secondary is 450  k. temperatures warmer or cooler by 50  k can be excluded as they result in significant discrepancies in brightness between the observed and calculated spectra .",
    "the shapes of the spectral distributions show that the atmospheres of both components have either very thin or no chloride / sulfide cloud layers , with a sedimentation parameter @xmath67 .",
    "we find that the masses of the primary and secondary are around 30 and @xmath72 , respectively , and that the age of the system is 4  8 gyr .",
    "this age is consistent with astrometric measurements by dupuy & kraus ( 2013 ) which show that the system has kinematics intermediate between the thin and thick disk populations of the galaxy .",
