    "the omnipresence of 1/f noise is one of the oldest puzzle of the contemporary physics . during more than 70 years since the first observation by johnson , long - memory processes with long - term correlations",
    "have been observed in many types of systems from physics , technology , biology , astrophysics , geophysics and sociology ( see @xcite and references herein ) .",
    "recently 1/f noise was discovered in human cognition @xcite , human coordination @xcite and even in distribution of prime numbers @xcite .    despite of the widespread occurrence of fluctuations of signals and variables exhibiting @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) behavior of the power spectral density @xmath2 at low frequencies in large diversity of systems no generally recognized explanation of the ubiquity of 1/f noise is still proposed .",
    "physical models of 1/f noise in some physical systems are usually very specialized , complicated ( see @xcite and references herein ) and they do not explain the omnipresence of the processes with @xmath0 spectrum @xcite .",
    "note also some mathematical analysis @xcite , models and algorithms of generation of the processes with 1/f noise @xcite .",
    "these models also expose some shortcomings : they are very specific , formal ( like  fractional brownian motion  or half - integral of a white noise signal ) or unphysical .",
    "they can not , as a rule , be solved analytically and they do not reveal the origin as well as the necessary and sufficient conditions for the appearance of 1/f type fluctuations .",
    "in such a situation the simple analytically solvable model system generating 1/f noise may essentially influence in the reveal of the origin and essence of the effect . here",
    "we present a model which generates 1/f noise in any desirably wide range of frequency .",
    "our model is a result of the search of necessary and sufficient conditions for the appearance of 1/f fluctuations in simple systems affected by the random external perturbations initiated in @xcite and originated from the observation of the transition from chaotic to nonchaotic behavior in the ensemble of randomly driven systems @xcite .",
    "contrary to the mcwhorter model @xcite based on the superposition of large number of lorentzian spectra and requiring a very wide distribution of relaxation times , our model contains only one relaxation rate @xmath3 and can have an exact 1/f spectrum in any desirably wide range of frequency .",
    "the model may be used as a basis for the checking of assumptions made in the derivation of 1/f noise spectrum for different systems .",
    "furthermore , it allows us to make a heuristic presumption for the generalizations of the theory of 1/f noise .",
    "numerical simulations and comparisons with analytical results confirm this supposition .",
    "in many cases , the intensity of some signal or current can be represented by a sequence of random ( however , as a rule , mutually correlated ) pulses or elementary events @xmath4 . here",
    "the function @xmath5 represents the shape of the @xmath6 pulse having an influence to the signal @xmath7 in the region of transit time @xmath8 .",
    "the signal or intensity of the current of particles in some space cross - section may , therefore , be expressed as @xmath9 it is easy to show that the shapes of the pulses influent mainly on the high frequency , @xmath10 with @xmath11 being the characteristic pulse length , power spectral density while fluctuations of the pulse amplitudes result , as a rule , in the white or lorentzian but not 1/f noise @xcite .",
    "therefore , we restrict our analysis to the noise due to the correlations between the transit times @xmath8 . in such an approach",
    "we can replace the function @xmath4 by the dirac delta function @xmath12 and the signal express as @xmath13 this model also corresponds to the flow of identical objects : electrons , photons , cars and so on . on the other hand , fluctuations of the amplitudes @xmath14 may result in the additional noise but can not reduce 1/f noise we are looking for .",
    "the power spectral density of the current ( 2 ) is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the whole observation time interval , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are minimal and maximal values of index @xmath6 in the interval of observation and the brackets @xmath19 denote the averaging over realizations of the process .    in this approach",
    "the power spectral density of the signal depends on the statistics and correlations of the transit times @xmath8 only .",
    "it is well known that sequence of random , poisson , transit times generates white ( shot ) noise @xcite .",
    "the sequence of transit times @xmath8 with random increments , @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the average time interval between pulses , @xmath22 denotes the sequence of uncorrelated normally distributed random variables with zero expectation and unit variance , i.e. the white noise source , and @xmath23 is the standard deviation of white noise ) results in the lorentzian spectra @xcite .",
    "here we will consider sequences of the transit times with random increments of the time intervals between pulses , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 .",
    "it is natural to restrict in some way the infinite brownian increase or decrease of the intervals @xmath26 , e.g. by the introduction of the relaxation to the average period @xmath27 rate @xmath3 .",
    "so , we have the recurrent equations for the transit times @xmath28    the simplest physical interpretation of the model ( 4 ) corresponds to one particle moving in the closed contour with the period of the drift of the particle round the contour fluctuating ( due to the external random perturbations ) about the average value @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "an advantage of the model ( 4 ) is that it may be solved analytically .",
    "so , an iterative solution of eqs . ( 4 ) results in an expression for the period @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the initial period . the dispersion of the period @xmath26 is @xmath31 } { 2\\gamma \\left ( 1-\\gamma /2\\right ) } \\simeq \\left\\ { \\begin{array}{ll } \\sigma ^2k , & 2k\\gamma \\ll 1 \\\\",
