    "magnetic reconnection is a physical process which converts magnetic free energy into kinetic energy and heat .",
    "this important mechanism of energy conversion is present in several space environments , such as solar flares and planetary magnetospheres @xcite .",
    "the first model of magnetic reconnection was developed within the framework of one - fluid resistive magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) , the so - called sweet - parker model @xcite . in the sweet - parker regime ,",
    "magnetic resistivity breaks the frozen - in condition at sufficiently small scales , thus allowing magnetic reconnection to occur .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that the reconnection rate ( i.e. the rate of change of magnetic flux due to reconnection ) scales as the square root of the magnetic resistivity , which leads to exceedingly low reconnection rates for most space physics environments ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "years later , @xcite reported a possible way out to the slow - rate problem giving rise to the concept of fast magnetic reconnection , i.e. reconnection rates virtually independent of magnetic resistivity .",
    "in contrast to the sweet - parker scaling , the petschek solution only showed a mild ( logarithmic ) dependence on magnetic resistivity , therefore being considered as fast reconnection .",
    "however , numerical results showed that the classical petschek configuration can not be attained in simulations with a spatially homogeneus resistivity ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    for collisionless magnetic reconnection ,",
    "i.e. where the mean free path of the plasma particles is much larger than any length scale in the system ( and therefore the resistivity is negligible ) , the resistive mhd model is no longer appropriate . from a more general perspective ,",
    "effects other than magnetic resistivity can break the frozen - in condition , such as electron inertia or non - gyrotropic contributions to pressure .",
    "discussions about the relative importance of electron inertia and non - gyrotropic ( off - diagonal ) pressure tensor terms can be found elsewhere @xcite . in the present paper we focus on the role of electron inertia .",
    "we also assume incompressibility and therefore non - gyrotropic pressure effects are not important @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we focus on the physical consequences of including the hall effect and electron inertia ( with isotropic pressures ) into a fluidistic description .    at spatial scales larger than the ion inertial length @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the speed of light , @xmath2 is the plasma proton frequency , @xmath3 is the electron charge and @xmath4 is the plasma density ) , the mhd description is adequate to describe global phenomena in most of the astrophysical plasmas .",
    "however , at scales below @xmath5 , where the ions become unmagnetized , the hall - mhd ( hmhd ) description becomes valid . at spatial scales of the order of the electron inertial length @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the plasma electron frequency ) or smaller ,",
    "the terms of electron inertia become dominant , and electrons are no longer frozen to the magnetic field lines @xcite . at this level of description ,",
    "a topological change of the magnetic field lines exclusively due to electron inertia becomes possible .",
    "@xcite presented a study of collisionless magnetic reconnection within the framework of electron inertia hall - mhd ( eihmhd ) , i.e. a two - fluid theoretical framework that extends hmhd and includes the inertia of electrons . using a pseudo - spectral code with no dissipative effects ,",
    "the authors numerically confirmed that the change in the topology of the magnetic field lines is exclusively due to the presence of electron inertia .",
    "moreover , they showed that the computed reconnection rates were independent of the mass ratio @xmath8 and remain a fair fraction of the alfvn velocity , which therefore qualifies as fast reconnection .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the level of description of eihmhd should not be confused with the so called electron mhd ( emhd ) approximation .",
    "instead , the eihmhd model retains the whole dynamics of both the electron and ion flows throughout all the relevant spatial scales .",
    "it asymptotically becomes mhd at the largest scales , hmhd at intermediate scales and emhd at the smallest scales . under the emhd approximation ,",
    "the ions are assumed to be static ( because of their much larger mass ) and the electrons are the ones to carry the electric current @xcite .",
    "geospace environment modeling ( gem ) reconnection challenge @xcite was a project designed to study collisionless magnetic reconnection assuming different theoretical approaches such as fully electromagnetic particle in cell @xcite , resistive mhd , hmhd @xcite and hybrid codes @xcite .",
    "the authors find that the reconnection rate is insensitive to the mechanism that breaks the frozen - in condition and its particular value is approximately @xmath90.1 ( in dimensionless form ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite claimed that this values of the reconnection rate is an universal constant as the system become very large .",
    "however , several studies have demonstrated that the reconnection rate might still depend on the value of the hall parameter @xcite , the level of turbulent fluctuations @xcite and the boundary conditions of the problem @xcite .",
    "this idea that mhd turbulence may play an important role in a magnetic reconnection setup was first proposed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite examined the influence of the hall effect and level of mhd turbulence on the reconnection rate in 2.5d compressible hall mhd .",
    "their results indicate that the reconnection rate is enhanced both by increasing the hall parameter and by the turbulence amplitude . following an approach of single - particle dynamics",
    ", @xcite found an expression for the reconnection rate , which strongly depends on the ion inertia length .",
    "@xcite reported an analytical treatment of quasi - stationary collisionless magnetic reconnection including the hall effect , scalar electron pressure gradient and electron inertia terms .",
    "the authors find that the reconnection rate depends on the ion inertial length , the boundary / initial conditions and the expression for the external driving force .",
    "more recently and within the context of incompressible hmhd , @xcite presented a quantitative analysis of reconnection valid for arbitrary values of the hall parameter ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "our main goal in this paper is to study the magnetic reconnection rate , using a full two - fluid model for a completely ionized hydrogen plasma , retaining the hall current and electron inertia . within this framework",
    ", we calculate a scaling for the quasi - stationary reconnection rate .",
    "our results show that the reconnection rate has a linear dependence on the hall parameter . in section [ eih - mhd ]",
    "we briefly describe the ideal eihmhd set of equations . in section [ theo ]",
    "we present our theoretical scaling for the reconnection rate . in section [ initcond ]",
    "we show the set of equations that describes the dynamical evolution of the problem in a 2.5d setup and the corresponding initial conditions . in section [ stat_mag_rec ] , considering a pseudo - spectral method to accurately run ideal simulations , we present our main numerical results .",
    "finally , in section [ conclus ] we compare and discuss our results with those reported in the literature and summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the detailed derivation of the eihmhd model have been presented elsewhere @xcite . in this section",
    "we summarize its key points .",
    "the equations of motion for an incompressible plasma made of ions and electrons with mass @xmath10 , charge @xmath11 , density @xmath12 ( because of quasi - neutrality ) , pressure @xmath13 and velocity @xmath14 respectively , can be written as @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total derivative . here ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are the magnetic and electric fields , @xmath21 is the electric current density and @xmath1 is the speed of light .",
    "this set of equations can be written in a dimensionless form in terms of a typical length scale @xmath22 , the constant particle density @xmath4 , an intensity @xmath23 for the magnetic field , a typical velocity @xmath24 ( the alfvn velocity , where @xmath25 ) and the electric field in units of @xmath26 , @xmath27 where we have introduced the dimensionless parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the dimensionless hall parameter , and @xmath30 has the form of a plasma frequency for a particle of mass @xmath31 . the dimensionless ion and electron inertial lengths can be defined in terms of their corresponding plasma frequencies @xmath32 simply as @xmath33 .",
    "note that in the limit of electron inertia equal to zero , we obtain @xmath34 , and therefore @xmath35 reduces to the usual hall parameter .",
    "however , throughout this paper we are going to retain the effect of electron inertia through the parameter @xmath36 .",
    "the expressions for the dimensionless ion and electron inertial scales ( @xmath37 ) in terms of the two dimensionless parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 are simply @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    for a hydrodynamic description of this two - fluid plasma",
    ", we replace the velocity field for each species ( i.e. @xmath14 ) in terms of two new vector fields .",
    "namely , the hydrodynamic velocity @xmath42 given by @xmath43 and the electric current density @xmath21 given by . from equations - , we can readily obtain the velocity of each species as @xmath44 the hydrodynamic equation of motion is the sum of the corresponding equations of motion and for each species @xmath45 - \\boldsymbol\\nabla p\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the total pressure .",
    "even though most of the terms in equation can easily be identified as a sum of the corresponding terms in equations - , the sum of the convective derivatives in these equations are nonlinear terms that give rise to a new nonlinear term in equation which is proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "note also that in the limit of negligible electron inertia ( i.e. , for @xmath47 ) , equation reduces to the equation of motion for the traditional one - fluid mhd .",
    "this is the case for the hall - mhd description as well , which is also a two - fluid theoretical description , but considering massless electrons ( @xmath48 ) .    on the other hand , the equation of motion for electrons ( equation ) ,",
    "using @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( with @xmath51 being the electron vorticity ) can be written as @xmath52 we define , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the hydrodynamic vorticity . taking the curl of equation ( [ mote ] ) we obtain a dynamical equation for the magnetic field @xmath55\\times\\textbf{b}'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equations and are the eihmhd equations .",
    "it is interesting to note that the presence of the electron mass introduces higher order derivative terms .",
    "this certainly has an impact at large wavenumbers , affecting the distribution of energy at very small scales .",
    "note that in the limit of negligible electron inertia ( i.e. , for @xmath56 ) , equations and reduce to the standard equation of motion and induction equation of hmhd @xcite .",
    "in the context of collisionless magnetic reconnection , the reconnection region develops a multi - scale structure in which the ion and electron inertial lengths @xmath37 play a role @xcite .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , ions can be considered approximately static and electrons are the ones to carry most of the electric current .",
    "also , at these scales the terms of electron inertia become dominant , and the electrons can no longer be frozen - in to the magnetic field lines @xcite . therefore , at this level of description , a change in the topology of the magnetic field lines which is exclusively due to electron inertia , becomes possible .    within scales near the x - point , where @xmath57 , we obtain a scaling for the reconnection rate as a function of @xmath39 and @xmath38 which are the main parameters of the problem .",
    "we consider a rectangular reconnection region with a width @xmath58 and a length @xmath59 ( see figure [ scheme ] ) .        by definition ,",
    "the reconnection rate in a 2d configuration is the out - of - plane component of the electric field ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) at the x - point .",
    "the electric field can be obtained from the ideal equation of motion for the electrons as @xmath61.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] under the assumption of quasi - stationarity ( i.e. , @xmath62 ) for a 2.5d setup ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) , the out - of - plane component of the electric field ( the @xmath64 direction ) reduces to @xmath65 where we have assumed @xmath66 .    in view of the sketch shown in figure [ scheme ] , close to the x - point",
    "is @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the magnetic field at the edge of the reconnection region in the inflow direction .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 to estimate the out - of - plane component of the magnetic field ( @xmath72 ) , we consider the @xmath64 component of the curl of equation ( under quasi - stationary conditions ) , i.e. @xmath73=0\\ ] ] which , in 2.5d setup leads to @xmath74 and therefore @xmath75 the @xmath64-component of the electric field at the x - point is then @xmath76 the dimensionless reconnection rate , i.e. @xmath77 , becomes @xmath78 as it was discussed in the introduction , we expect @xmath70 and @xmath79 not to depend on @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "their particular values are only determined by the boundary and initial conditions .",
    "nevertheless , in the next section we evaluate the potential dependence of @xmath70 , @xmath80 and @xmath79 with the hall parameter in our numerical results .    assuming that the thickness of the current sheet is essentially the electron inertial length , i.e. @xmath81 and also that the typical magnetic field intensity is @xmath82 and the typical length scale is @xmath83 we obtain @xmath84 note that if @xmath81 , according to we also obtain that ( in the regime of quasi - stationary reconnection ) @xmath85 .",
    "note also that the reconnection rate is independent of the mass ratio @xmath38 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "in a 2.5d setup , the vector fields depend on two coordinates , say _ x _ and _ y _ , although they have their three components . considering the incompressible case , i.e. @xmath86 , we can write the magnetic and velocity fields as @xmath87 + \\hat{\\textbf z}~b(x , y , t)\\\\   \\textbf u & = & \\boldsymbol\\nabla\\times[\\hat{\\textbf z}~\\varphi(x , y , t ) ] + \\hat{\\textbf z}~u(x , y , t ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the scalar potential for the magnetic and velocity fields respectively and @xmath90 and @xmath91 are simply the corresponding out - of - plane components . in terms of these scalar potentials , equations and take the form @xmath92 - [ a , j ] - ( 1-\\mu)\\mu\\lambda^2[b,\\nabla^2b ]   \\\\ \\label{1.2 } \\partial_t~u & = & [ \\varphi , u ] - [ a , b ] - ( 1-\\mu)\\mu\\lambda^2[j , b ] \\\\",

    "when @xmath48 ( massless electrons ) this set of equations reduces to the incompressible 2.5d hmhd equations @xcite .    in the present paper , we performed 2.5d eihmhd   simulations using a pseudo - spectral code , which yields exponentially fast numerical convergence and negligible numerical dissipation .",
    "the accuracy of the numerical scheme can be verified in part by looking at the behavior of the ideal invariants of the eihmhd equations in time .",
    "the simulations reported here correspond to zero viscosity and resistivity , and the total energy @xcite is conserved by the numerical scheme with an error @xmath95 of less than @xmath96 .",
    "the ion and electron helicities were initially zero , and throughout their evolution differ from zero in less than @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , hereafter we assume that our code conserves energy .",
    "the reconnection processes that are observed to occur , must then be the exclusive result of electron inertia .    our initial condition to simulate a thin current sheet",
