    "there exist several mechanisms which produces anisotropies on the cmb : the primary anisotropies which take place at the last scattering epoch and the secondary anisotropies such as the sunyaev - zeldovich effect which occurs while the cmb photons are travelling through the universe .",
    "we will concentrate here on a particular secondary anisotropy first discussed by rees & sciama ( 1968 ) . as pointed out by these authors",
    ", there is a gravitational effect on the cmb photons while they are crossing evolving cosmic structures such as a collapsing cluster of galaxies or expanding voids .",
    "indeed photons climb out of a slightly different potential well than the one into which they entered .",
    "this effect is usually referred as the rees - sciama effect .",
    "+ early approaches to this problem were based on the `` swiss cheese '' model ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite & @xcite ) , whereas more recent attempts have used the continuous tolman - bondi solution ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to present here an improved model which , for the first time , treats such a problem exactly ( see section [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "+ in section [ sec : cluster ] we apply our model to a rich galaxy cluster at a redshift @xmath0 .",
    "we investigate the properties of the collapsing cluster and verify that its density - profile is of a realistic shape .",
    "we then give , in section [ sec : dt ] , an upper limit for the temperature decrement that such an evolving cosmic structure could imprint on the cmb .",
    "our result is compared to previous works .",
    "+ section [ sec : dist ] deals with distant clusters ( @xmath1 ) since it is reasonable to assume that , at such an epoch , those objects were in a stage of formation and that our spherical collapse model would be suitable .",
    "the focus is put on the gravitational lensing phenomenon and how this would distort the observed cmb power spectrum .",
    "+ we finish in section [ sec : discussion ] by a short conclusion and discuss the applicability of our work to model the microwave decrement observed towards the , possibly lensed , quasar pair pc1643 + 4631 a&b .",
    "+ the methods and results introduced in this poster are discussed in further details in forthcoming papers ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in this poster we are concerned with the formation of spherical galaxy clusters ( i.e. pure infall ) in an expanding background universe . as in the tolman - bondi model applied by @xcite , the evolution of both the collapsing cluster and the expanding universe",
    "are governed by the same pressure - less fluid equations .",
    "initially , the density of our fluid is uniform .",
    "only the velocity field is perturbed in order to form a realistic cluster . in a given cosmology , this perturbation",
    "is controlled by two parameters ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) as illustrated in figure [ fig : swiss2 ] .",
    "@xmath2 is related to the size of the perturbation and @xmath3 to its rate of growth .",
    "those parameters are free and we choose them so that the resulting observed cluster is realistic ( see section [ sec : cluster ] ) .",
    "+    we find that our model has many advantages and treats the problem much more rigorously than older attempts , particularly in the case of works based on the `` swiss cheese '' ( sc ) models . indeed ,",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : swiss1 ] , the sc models deals with discontinuous density and velocity distributions since an unrealistic vacuum region is needed to separate the perturbation from the universe .",
    "another improvement made with regard to the sc models is that our perturbation is defined by only two free parameters rather than three in the sc case .",
    "more recent studies of the problem use the tolman - bondi solution ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which gives a similar approach to our own .",
    "in particular , both the forming cluster and the external universe are treated as a whole and the fluid distributions are continuous .",
    "we believe our model is a refinement of the work based on the tolman bondi solution .",
    "our mathematical formulation is clearer and does not need any approximation .",
    "the underling gauge theory of gravity ( @xcite ) that we use deals straightforwardly with observable quantities such as the photon energy ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we do not need to remove a posteriori dipole nor quadrupole - like anisotropy form the obtained cmb fluctuation ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we model the formation of a very rich abell cluster . the characteristics ( see table [ table : cluster ] )",
    "are chosen to be similar to those of the clusters described in @xcite and @xcite so that our results can be compared .",
    "+    # 1    .[table : cluster]cluster characteristics . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the cluster is placed at a redshift @xmath0 , with a core radius @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is defined as the radius at which the cluster energy falls to one - half its maximum value )",
    ". the maximal baryonic density @xmath6 encounter by an observed photon is taken to be @xmath7 and the baryon to dark - matter mass ratio is assumed to be 0.1 .",
    "the @xmath8-dependencies for @xmath5 and @xmath6 ensure that the observed cluster characteristics ( i.e. angular size and x - ray luminosity ) are independent of the hubble parameter . throughout this paper",
    "we assume @xmath9 .",
    "+ figure [ fig : dens_vel ] shows the fluid density and the fluid velocity as a function of proper time as experienced by a photon which travels straight through the centre of the cluster . from the figure we see clearly that the fluid distributions are continuous .",
    "we next consider ( fig [ fig : density ] ) the density profile of the cluster at the time @xmath10 ago , when the photon experienced the maximum density @xmath11 . in order to check that the obtained density distribution is of realistic shape",
    ", we fit our profile to the equilibrium spherical king model ( @xcite ) : @xmath12^{-3\\beta/2 } , \\label{king}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the central density of the cluster , @xmath13 represents some core radius and @xmath14 is the conventional power - law index for such models",
    ". the results of a simple least - squares fit are @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the result of this fit is very encouraging since it shows that our model leads to a radial density profile that matches quite closely those of observed clusters .",
    "we now consider photon energy and concentrate on the cmb anisotropy produced when the photon passes through the cluster described in section [ sec : cluster ] .",
    "one must remember however that our model assumes a pressure - less fluid and so the cluster , in pure - infall , might evolves too rapidly .",
    "therefore the temperature perturbations given in this section should be considered as upper limits .",
    "+ figure [ fig : dt ] shows the cmb anisotropy due to the gravitational perturbation of the cluster described in table [ table : cluster ] .",
    "the maximum temperature distortion occurs at the centre of the cluster and has the value @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "one notices that the distortion extends to rather large projected angles ( e.g. @xmath22 for an observed angle of @xmath23 in the @xmath21 case ) .",
    "we may also point out the fact that the anisotropy becomes slightly positive at large angles .",
    "we can compare the central decrements calculated above with those of previous authors . for @xcite type i and type ii clusters ,",
    "the calculated central decrements are @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , whereas @xcite quote the decrement @xmath26 . for two cluster models with similar physical properties",
    "@xcite finds @xmath27 .",
    "finally @xcite used the sc model to predict a considerably larger central decrement of @xmath28 .",
    "however , this last value corresponds to a very dense , unrealistic cluster .",
    "we can notice that , for @xmath20 , our predicted value is in rough agreement with @xcite type ii , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however our result for @xmath21 is about five times larger since previous works predict the same value whatever is @xmath29 .",
    "we then suggest that , in such a universe , the effect on cmb photons may be more significant that previously stated .",
    "we consider , in this section , the formation of a massive cluster located at a redshift @xmath1 .",
    "it is more reasonable to apply our model for a distant cluster rather than the one described in section [ sec : cluster ] .",
    "indeed , at such redshifts one could expect galaxy clusters to be in a formation process and display large inward radial velocities . as from now",
    ", the cosmology is taken to be @xmath9 and @xmath30 .",
    "the cluster characteristics are the following : @xmath1 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the mass within @xmath33 is @xmath34 . in the next section",
    "we investigate the lensing effect caused by such a cluster as well as the effect imprinted on the cmb temperature and power spectrum .",
    "a massive cluster such as described above is a powerful gravitational lens .",
    "this effect is illustrated in figure [ fig:4lens ] .",
    "our model also allows a quantitative study of the effect of dynamically evolving lenses on the cmb fluctuations . by simulating maps of fluctuations in the cmb due to inflation and/or topological defects",
    ", we can investigate how features in these maps are affected by the presence of the lens .",
    "as an example , figure [ fig : cmb ] shows the effect of our collapsing cluster on a cmb fluctuations realisation . the result is a central decrease of temperature at the centre ( i.e. @xmath35 in our case ) as well as a global magnification of the features .    aside from studying individual maps , we can also study the statistical effect that a population of such lenses would have on the power spectrum of the cmb fluctuations .",
    "this power spectrum is currently of immense theoretical and observational interest , since it is now a possibility that the spectrum may be measured , and so the values of cosmological constants may be found to unprecedented accuracy .",
    "such determinations depend , however , on distinctive features in the power spectrum which may be affected by a population of large clusters .",
    "previous work on this effect has been performed such as @xcite , but we have now incorporated the effect of dynamically collapsing clusters in a proper general relativistic fashion .",
    "figure [ fig : power ] gives the result obtained with the cluster used in the current section .",
    "we find that the distinctive peaks in the power spectrum are slightly smoothed out by such a population , and so this effect should be taken into account in future analyses .",
    "a cmb decrement of @xmath36 has been observed by the ryle - telescope towards the pair of quasars pc1643 + 4631 a & b at red - shift @xmath37 separated by 100 arc - seconds ( @xcite ) . assuming a sunyaev - zeldovich effect from a cluster of galaxies , this is indicative of a rich intervening cluster of total mass @xmath38 , although",
    ", no x - ray cluster has yet been observed in that direction .",
    "this suggests that the object is lying at a red - shift greater than one .",
    "the quasars spectra analysis reveals that they might be originating from a unique source lensed by the distant cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "using our model , we are able to fit those observations and retrieve the s - z flux decrement as well as the 100 arc - seconds separation .",
    "to do so , we have to consider the cluster described in section [ sec : dist ] with an electron temperature of @xmath39 , which corresponds to a rich but rather cool cluster . as we stated in section [ subsec : lensing ] , the resulting rees - sciama temperature decrement is @xmath40 which is a considerable fraction of the s - z decrement , here @xmath41 .",
    "fitting those data is of great importance since such a distant lensed - pair has previously never been observed . as the cluster lies at a rather large red - shift",
    ", we believe that a model such as ours , computing rigorously both the cluster and the universe evolutions , is needed ."
