    "originally studied by lematre ( @xcite ) , tolman ( @xcite ) and bondi ( @xcite ) , these models are the simplest generalization of the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models with a non - zero density gradient .    at least three cosmological applications of ltb models have been discussed .",
    "the first relates to the evolution of inhomogeneities and peculiar velocities in an expanding universe .",
    "important results have been derived under the assumption of  unique bang time ",
    "( olson & silk 1979 ) , when every mass shell has been simultaneusly created .",
    "so , silk & wilson ( @xcite , @xcite ) , olson & silk ( @xcite ) , and olson & stricland ( @xcite ) studied the formation of galactic clusters from small density and velocity perturbations ( implicitly , non - simultaneous bang is used in silk & wilson ( 1979b ) ) .",
    "it was shown that after a long time the initial conditions are forgotten and a universal density profile is formed .",
    "the ltb model has been applied to the determination of the mass density parameter @xmath1 from the local peculiar velocity field ( silk 1974 ) , and of the mass of the virgo cluster ( hoffman et al .",

    "( @xcite ) .",
    "they use the frw model for small ( observable ) scales and assume the ltb model for large scales .",

    "this leads to a new application of the ltb models , pointed out by bonnor ( 1972 ) , where the fractal structure is treated as spherically symmetrical inhomogeneities centered in every galaxy .",
    "baryshev et al .",
    "( @xcite ) showed that the linear perturbation theory for the growth of density fluctuations leads to a non - linear hubble law if all matter is in the fractals .",

    "( @xcite ) and matravers ( @xcite ) gave the same conclusions .",
    "another explanation for the linear hubble law within the fractal structure ( the `` hubble - de vaucouleurs paradox '' ) was proposed by baryshev et al .",

    ", from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , where ( and beyond which ) the hubble law is seen .",
    "] the present paper shows a third way to make the linear hubble law , by abandoning the assumption of a unique bang time .",
    "there are two ways to parameterize ltb models .",
    "the first , introduced by tolman and bondi , is called the @xmath9 approach .",
    "the second uses observational coordinates ( ellis et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as underlined by matravers ( 1998 ) , the @xmath9",
    "coordinate approach , adopted in the present paper , provides a physical interpretation of the evolution of the universe in co - moving coordinates .",
    "our series of papers is concerned with the 1st and 3rd of the above areas and their theoretical basis . in this paper",
    "we study initial conditions and compatibility of density and velocity laws . in paper",

    "[ review ] we review the ltb models in co - moving coordinates . in sect .",
    "[ sec 3 ] we study conditions for the existence of the zero - velocity surface in the closed central part of the ltb model .",
    "we find two criteria to check out if the zero - velocity surface exists . in sect .",
    "[ sec 4 ] we show the velocity deflection from the hubble law within ltb models with unique bang time and density law with fractal dimension @xmath2 , apply the criterium for the existence of the zero - velocity surface , and show how its location depends on initial conditions and cosmological density @xmath11 .",
    "we also calculate the bang time function which reproduces the linear hubble law at all scales within the inhomogeneities described by ltb models at the present cosmic epoch .",
    "the ltb models are the simplest exact , nonlinear , inhomogeneous , nonstationary , isotropic dust models in general relativity . in co - moving ( lagrangian ) and",

    "@xmath16 is the speed of light , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is an euler coordinate .",
    "such metrics and energy - momentum tensor , together with einstein s equations , produce a set of inhomogeneous cosmological models , generally with time- and space - dependent curvature , which are described by the following system ( tolman 1934 ) : @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "einstein s equation eq.([e equations 1 0 ] ) defines the function @xmath26 : @xmath27 @xmath28 is one of the undetermined functions of the models . here",

    "via eq.([metric 1 ] ) , the @xmath29-component reduces to the equation of motion @xmath30 the first and second integrals of eq.([eq - m ] ) are : @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the second and third undetermined functions of the models .",
    "@xmath35 is the bang time @xmath34 .",
    "equation ( [ e equations 0 0 ] ) gives for the density : @xmath36 eq.([t:15:1 ] ) shows that the models become singular by two different causes , defined by @xmath37 ( which corresponds to the bang time @xmath34 ) and @xmath38 ( which corresponds to the layer intersection time @xmath39 ) .",
    "the bang time ( silk & wilson 1979a ) and layer intersection time function ( for flat ltb model see gromov @xcite ) , respectively , correspond to these singularities .",
    "the gravitating mass @xmath40 and the invariant mass @xmath41 of the dust are defined by the energy - momentum tensor : @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",

    "so , @xmath48 one of the interpretations of the function @xmath28 , given by bondi ( 1947 ) , relates it to the curvature and components of the einstein tensor : @xmath49 @xmath50 the space curvature is equal to zero if and only if @xmath51 .",
    "the ltb models are defined up to some transformation of the co - moving coordinate @xmath52 , which decreases the number of undetermined functions from 3 to 2 ( just @xcite ; just & kraus @xcite ) .",
    "see also hellaby & lake ( @xcite ) and hellaby ( @xcite ) for interesting examples .",
    "these two functions should be chosen from the set : @xmath53 the transformation is not unique and may be chosen according to the character of the problem ( see gromov ( @xcite ) .",
    "the transformation @xmath54 is time independent , so it can be used to fix one of the functions from the set eq.([set ] ) . in this case one",
    "speaks about a parametrization of the ltb model .",
    "we give two examples .",
    "the first is often used :    @xmath55    this implies that @xmath33 is defined by the initial density profile @xmath56 .",
    "it was fully studied by liu ( @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) , and used e.g. by ribeiro ( 1992a , 1992b , 1993 ) and gonalves & moss ( @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative transformation is : @xmath57 it was first used by eardley ( @xcite ) and studied by gromov ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the bang time @xmath58 is used as one of the initial conditions by silk & wilson ( 1979a ) , olson & silk ( 1979 ) , olson & stricland ( 1990 ) .",
    "we use two different sets of initial conditions : a ) bang time @xmath34 and initial density profile @xmath59 , and b ) initial density @xmath59 and velocity @xmath60 profile .",
    "they are interconnected as may be seen from a simple analogy of an apple dropping from an apple tree .",
    "if the initial position and velocity , and an equation of motion are given , we can calculate the time it will reach the ground . for the ltb models it is the same .",
    "if we start with @xmath61 and @xmath62 as initial conditions , we can calculate the velocity profile @xmath63 for @xmath64 : since a particle must reach the centre by the time @xmath34 , it must have a predefined velocity at @xmath64 .",
    "since the density profile is also given , the gravitational potential becomes fixed by the same initial conditions .",
    "as from each two functions the third may be derived , all three can not be selected freely .",
    "now we restate the models in terms of dimensionless quantities .",
    "we use the following characteristic values : @xmath65 @xmath66 and dimensionless variables : @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the characteristic length and time , @xmath11 is the density parameter of the frw background , @xmath71 is the value of the hubble parameter at the moment of the initial conditions , @xmath72 is the dust density , @xmath73 is the critical density , @xmath74 is the characteristic mass , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are dimensionless euler and lagrangian coordinates , @xmath77 is the dimensionless density , and @xmath78 is the dimensionless mass of the dust . in terms of these quantities , the bang time is written as @xmath79 . the index @xmath75 reminds us that the bang time is the time required for the particle to come from its initial position @xmath80 to @xmath81 .    in this section we show how one can use the first and second integrals , eq.([tb - klass ] ) and eq.([t:15:11 ] ) , to calculate the zero - velocity surface for ltb models if we relax the often used assumption of unique bang time .",

    "the above approach utilizes the _ coordinate criterium _ for the existence of a central collapsing domain .",
    "using eq.([closed 1 ] ) , we can also define a second form for this criterium , the _ mass criterium_. from eq.([closed 1 ] ) it follows that the two limits of function @xmath123 correspond to two characteristic masses .",
    "the mass @xmath124 , @xmath125 corresponds to the low limit of radial euler coordinate @xmath120 .",

    "two fundamental empirical laws have been established from extragalactic data .",
    "first , there is the power law density - distance relation ( de vaucouleurs law ) which corresponds to fractal struture ( mandelbrot @xcite ) with fractal dimension @xmath136 up to the depth of available catalogs @xmath137 100 @xmath3 mpc .",
    "( sylos labini et al .",
    "second , cepheids , tf - distance indicator and type ia supernovae confirm the linearity of hubble s redshift - distance law within the same distances where the fractality exists .",
    "baryshev et al .",
    "( 1998 ) emphasized that the linear redshift - distance relation inside the fractal ( inhomogeneous ) matter distribution creates the so - called hubble - de vaucouleurs ( hdev ) paradox .",
    "it means that the interpretation of the hubble law within frw cosmological models as a consequence of a homogeneous galaxy distribution disagrees with new data on the galaxy distribution for a scale interval from 1 to 100 mpc .",
    "we emphasize that the paradox exist for small distance scales ( up to 100 mpc ) , i.e. for redshifts less then 0.03 .",
    "hence the arguments of abdalla et al ( @xcite ) on essential relativistic corrections do not explain the paradox .",
    "two solutions of the hdev paradox are previously known .",
    "the first one ( baryshev et al . 1998 ) is based on uniform _ dark _ matter starting just from the halos of galaxies , in which case the standard frw model works .",
    "but then the fractal distribution of _ luminous _ galaxies can appear only from special initial perturbations of frw .. ]    the second solution is a very low value for the global average density ( baryshev et al .",
    "1998 ; humphreys et al .",
    "however , if the upper cut - off scale of the fractal structure is large , the low density contradicts the estimated density of the baryonic luminous and dark matter .",
    "the ltb model has proved useful for understanding the kinematics of galaxies around _ individual _ mass concentrations .",
    "for example , teerikorpi et al . (",
    "1992 ) could put in evidence the expected behaviour in the virgo supercluster : 1 ) hubble law at large distances , 2 ) retardation at smaller distances , 3 ) zero - velocity surface , and 4 ) collapsing galaxies at still smaller distances .    bonner ( 1972 ) was the first to apply the ltb model to the hierarchical cosmology .",
    "he used de vaucouleurs s density law @xmath138 with @xmath139 .",
    "ribeiro ( 1992a , 1992b , 1993 ) has developed a numerical approach to solving ltb equation for fractal galaxy distribution .",
    "humpreys et al .",
    "( 1998b ) gave a relation between number counts and redshifts for ltb models with large scale frw behaviour .",
    "however , the application of ltb models to a fractal distribution leads to a conceptual problem , because the original ltb formulation contained a central point of the universe , around which the density distribution is isotropic . in a fractal distribution ( mandelbrot @xcite )",
    "there is no unique centre , but every object of the structure may be treated as a local centre which accommodates the ltb centre .",
    "every structure point is surrounded by a spherically symmetric ( in average ) matter distribution .    in this sense",
    ", the application of the ltb model to fractals means that there is an infinity of ltb exemplars with centres on every structure point .",
    "their initial conditions are slightly different , because for any fixed scale the average density is approximately constant . for different scales",
    "the density is a power law .",
    "this excludes geocentrism and makes possible the use of ltb models as an exact general relativistic cosmological model where expansion of space becomes scale dependent .",
    "from a fixed galaxy is determined by the total mass of the sphere around this galaxy . for ltb fractal models the space expansion at distance @xmath140 from a fixed point of the fractal structure is also determined by the average mass of the sphere around this point ( paper iii ) .",
    "]      we showed in sect.3 that a unique bang time and constant density imply open frw models . here , with nonlinear ltb models , we study density perturbations with arbitrary amplitude on the frw background and show how the initial fractal density changes the models .    humphreys et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used a density profile which needed junction conditions for densities corresponding to different scales .",
    "we consider the analytical case of a smooth density profile .",

    "4 shows the resulting non - linear velocity - distance relations down to the zero - velocity radius , which in a natural manner marks the distance close to which the deflection from the hubble law becomes very significant .",
    "tables 1 - 4 and fig .",
    "4 confirm the previous conclusion by baryshev et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that the observed linear hubble law is compatible with such a fractal density only if the frw density parameter @xmath11 is small .",
    "for instance , if @xmath170 , then the zero - velocity radius @xmath171 ranges 3.4 - 3400 mpc for the range of the density contrast @xmath172 , and is 344 mpc for the `` preferred '' value of @xmath173 . with a very small value of @xmath11 , 0.001",
    ", @xmath171 appears around 0.6 mpc , which is an intergroup scale , while a good linear hubble flow is reached around 6 mpc .",
    "here we study still another solution of the hdev paradox within the ltb model : a non - unique bang time may produce the linear hubble law within a fractal structure having an upper cut - off .",
    "we take the initial conditions from the observations in the domain from 1 mpc to 100 mpc , i.e. the fractal density and the hubble law : @xmath174 the bang time in this situation is calculated by two formulas , corresponding to the closed and open domains : @xmath175 @xmath176 where from eq.([open ] ) and eq.([i 15 ] ) , @xmath177 . for @xmath178 and @xmath179",
    "the bang time @xmath180 is shown in fig.5 .",
    "we have studied the ltb model solution for two pairs of initial conditions related to observations : ( bang time function , density profile ) and ( density profile , velocity function ) which both permit one to treat the ltb problem as the cauchy problem .",
    "the second pair may be obtained from observations at the present epoch , while from the first pair , with bang time function assumed , one may predict the present - day velocity function .",
    "a discussion of this mathematical side is given by gromov ( @xcite ) .",
    "we show that for most parameter values of the model , there is the zero - velocity surface .",
    "our study is much guided by bondi s ( 1947 ) idea when he said `` the assumption of spherical symmetry supplies us with a model which lies between the completely homogeneous models of cosmology and the actual universe with its irregularities . ''",
    "as the `` actual universe with its irregularities '' has turned out to be fractal , at least in its luminous matter and in scales up to 100 mpc or more , we follow some earlier works in representing fractality with spherically symmetrical systems of different scales .",
    "the interesting conceptual difficulties will be treated in paper iii .",
    "here we have assumed that the fractal representation is adequate and complement our previous work ( baryshev et al .",
    "@xcite ) on the hubble law within fractals .",
    "the qualitative conclusions of that paper , based on the linear regime , are confirmed by our exact ltb solutions . in particular , a fractal distribution of matter with @xmath181 , smoothly going over to the frw background , generally results in a large deviation from the linear hubble law , when there is a unique bang time .",
    "only if @xmath182 , does a reasonable density contrast @xmath183 produce an acceptable hubble law .",
    "as the above mentioned two pairs of initial conditions are interconnected , one may start from the linear hubble law as the velocity function , and derive the required bang time function .",
    "this we have done , and conclude that in this manner in the frame of the ltb models it is thus possible to have a linear velocity - distance relation when matter distribution is fractal .",
    "physically , this would mean that different spherical shells are created at different moments given by the bang time function .",
    "thus the list of possible solutions of the hubble - de vaucouleurs paradox ( baryshev et al .",
    "@xcite ) in the frame of the ltb description of fractality now includes 1 ) a very low cosmic density , or 2 ) a dominating smooth dark matter , or 3 ) non - simultaneus bang time .",

    "the work was supported by the center for cosmoparticle physics `` cosmion '' ( project `` cosmoparticle physics '' ) , the russian program `` integration''(project n.578 ) , and the academy of finland ( project `` cosmology in the local galaxy universe '' ) ."
