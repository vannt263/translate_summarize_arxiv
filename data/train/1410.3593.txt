    "few - layer graphene ( flg ) is a new material with extraordinary properties and plenty of prospective applications.@xcite it consists of parallel graphene layers bound together by weak van der waals ( vdw ) interactions .",
    "although these interactions are much weaker than the covalent bonds between the carbon atoms within the layers , they give rise to measurable changes in the electronic band structure and phonon dispersion of flg.@xcite in particular , the low - frequency raman spectra in the region below about @xmath0 @xmath1 exhibit distinct features due to resonant scattering from quasi - acoustic phonons with shearing and breathing atomic motion of the adjacent layers , so - called shearing modes ( sms ) and breathing modes ( bms).@xcite the observed position and shape of these raman features can be used for characterization of flg , supported by theoretical predictions .",
    "the weak vdw interactions are usually described by interatomic pair potentials with parameters fitted to the experimental interlayer separation and elastic constant @xmath2 of graphite.@xcite such empirical potentials overestimate the cohesive energy compared to the experimental one .",
    "the ab - initio calculations within the density function theory ( dft ) in the local density approximation ( lda ) reproduce well the measured interlayer separation , while those within the dft in the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) overestimate this quantity.@xcite the former approximation predicts almost twice smaller cohesive energy with respect to the experimental ones and the latter one yields even lower cohesive energy.@xcite    the weakness of the interlayer vdw interactions , compared to the intralayer covalent bonds , poses a serious problem before the modeling of the quasi - acoustic motion of the layers of graphite and flg .",
    "the interlayer interaction has little effect on the high - frequency phonons in graphite but is crucial for the quasi - acoustic phonon branches .",
    "the force - constant lattice - dynamical models with many adjustable parameters fitted to the experimental interlayer separation and quasi - acoustic phonon branches of graphite render a very good description of these branches both in graphite and flg.@xcite the dynamical models utilizing the lennard - jones potential,@xcite rahaman - stillinger - lemberg potential,@xcite tersoff - brenner bond order potential,@xcite and long - range carbon bond order potential@xcite generally work well for the bm but perform poorly for the sm.@xcite the dft approach with dynamical matrix derived from perturbation theory ( dfpt ) predicts with moderately good accuracy the quasi - acoustic branches of graphite.@xcite however , the same approach is not as successful for flg , usually yielding sms and bms deviating by up to several per cent from the observed ones.@xcite the force constant models suffer the drawback of not being transferable to other layered carbon structures .",
    "the models using empirical potentials or the ab - initio approach have not so far demonstrated acceptable accuracy for the sm and bm .",
    "moreover , the ab - initio calculations are becoming rather time and resource consuming with the increase of the system size .",
    "we show that these drawbacks of the empirical models and ab - initio approach can be overcome within a non - orthogonal tight - binding model with matrix elements , derived from a dft study on carbon dimers .",
    "this model has so far been applied to covalently bonded systems@xcite but not to systems with vdw interactions .    here , we report the calculation of the phonon dispersion of graphite and flg with ab and abc layer stacking within the non - orthogonal tight - binding model with matrix elements , derived within the dft approach .",
    "the difference between the total energy and the band energy of the system is modeled by a pair potential with parameters fitted to the interlayer separation , sm and bm of graphite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "the calculation of the phonon dispersion of flg is performed within a non - orthogonal tight - binding model with two different sets of tight - binding matrix elements for the description of the intralayer and interlayer interactions .",
    "the intralayer matrix elements are taken from ref .   and",
    "the interlayer ones are derived here using the computational scheme of the latter reference .",
    "namely , the wavefunctions of the electronic system are expanded in terms of localized atomic orbitals with orbital momentum quantum number @xmath4 and @xmath5 , so - called @xmath6 and @xmath7 orbitals . within the dft - lda",
    ", the kohn - sham equation is solved for carbon dimers to determine the matrix elements of the hamiltinian @xmath8 and the overlap matrix elements @xmath9 between two types of orbitals located at the two carbon atoms of the dimer .",
    "for example , for atoms along the @xmath10 axis , the matrix elements between the pairs of orbitals ( @xmath6,@xmath6 ) , ( @xmath6,@xmath11 ) , ( @xmath11,@xmath11 ) , and ( @xmath12,@xmath12 ) are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the slater - koster scheme is used to express the angular dependence of the matrix elements for differently oriented carbon pairs in the investigated carbon structure . in order to obtain usable matrix elements ,",
    "the atomic potential is modified by adding the term @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the electron radial coordinate and @xmath19 is taken equal to twice the covalent atomic radius of carbon ( @xmath20  ) .",
    "the resulting electron density is compressed compared to that of the free atom .",
    "the derived matrix elements were shown to describe well the electron levels of carbon clusters.@xcite the total electronic energy is presented as the sum of the band energy , computed from the occupied electron bands , and an additional energy , accounting for the remaining electron correlations .",
    "the additional energy is represented as the sum of pair potentials .",
    "the obtained matrix elements and pair potentials for the intralayer electrons have been shown to perform well in the calculation of the electron and phonon dispersion of carbon nanotubes@xcite and graphene.@xcite    we extend this approach to derive the interlayer matrix elements and pair potential and apply them to the study of the static and dynamic properties of graphite and flg with bernal ( ab ) and rhombohedral ( abc ) stacking of the layers ( fig .",

    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the straightforward determination of the parameters of the attractive interlayer potential can be done by fitting the tight - binding total energy to the ab - initio one .",
    "we did not follow this route because the ab - initio approach does not predict the interlayer separation and cohesive energy with sufficient accuracy . instead , we fitted the parameters of the potential to the experimental values of the interlayer separation , sm and bm of graphite . for every set of derived coefficients ,",
    "the calculated cohesive energy was checked for agreement with the experimental one .",
    "the use of up to three coefficients at constrained interlayer separation yields higher frequencies and cohesive energy that show a trend of decrease with increasing the number of coefficients , as shown in table ii .",
    "this behavior persists for up to two coefficients even on imposing constraints on the sm and bm .",
    "however , three coefficients could be fitted to reproduce the measured interlayer separation , sm and bm , while the cohesive energy falls in the interval of the measured values of @xmath22 mev / atom .",
    "the derived coefficients are @xmath23 ev@xmath24 , @xmath25 ev@xmath26 , and @xmath27 ev@xmath28 .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath29 may be due to the adopted computational scheme for the tight - binding matrix elements , which utilizes compressed electron density for the carbon atoms .",
    "it can not be excluded that this feature is an intrinsic one , inherited from dft , which normally yields exponential attraction energy with commonly used exchange - correlation functionals@xcite or higher - power attraction energy by means of specially designed functionals.@xcite equation 1 can be fitted well with more than three coefficients at the chosen constraints but the fit is no longer unique .",
    "the calculated vdw energy and the total interlayer energy of graphite are shown as a function of the interlayer separation in fig .",
    "we apply the interlayer matrix elements and pair potential to the calculation of the phonon dispersion of graphite .",

    "these modes can be longitudinal ( l ) or transverse ( t ) with atomic displacements along or perpendicular to the wavevector , respectively .",
    "the low - frequency phonon branches along the @xmath3k direction ( wavevector parallel to the layers ) can be classified similarly , the only difference being for the transverse branches , which are denoted by t and z for in - plane and out - of - plane atomic displacements , respectively .",

    "the obtained average interlayer separation for all studied structures is @xmath33   with deviations within @xmath34    for the different structures .",
    "the reason for such small deviations can be perceived in the short - range nature of the interlayer interactions , which are negligible beyond the nearest layer .",
    "the cohesive energies per atom of the infinite ab and abc structures are almost equal , but the former has cohesive energy by a few mev larger than the latter .",
    "this result allows concluding that the ab crystal is more stable than the abc one , which explains the predominant observation of three - dimensional graphite with bernal stacking . the cohesive energy for several structures with different number of layers is shown in fig .",
    "6 . as a general trend , the cohesive energy increases with increasing the number of layers , which is due to the increase of the average number of neighboring layers from one for 2ab to two for graphite .",
    "the cohesive energy of the 2ab structure is almost half of that for bernal graphite .",
    "the difference between the cohesive energies of ab and abc stacked structures with the same number of layers is negligibly small .",

    "the zo phonons are the bms and the doubly degenerate lo - to phonons are the sms of the flg . for all optical phonons the adjacent layers show a variety of in - phase and counter - phase displacement .",
