    "only 15 radio pulsars of the current catalog of approximately 700 are within 5  of sgr  a@xmath10 and none are within 1  ( taylor , manchester , & lyne  1993 ) . discovering pulsars in or near the galactic center ( gc ) would provide exciting opportunities for probing magnetoionic material , the gravitational potential , and star formation in the gc ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "counterparts to x- and @xmath11-ray gc sources may also involve radio pulsars or their progenitors . moreover , dynamical constraints on the mass in the gc combined with infrared observations suggest that neutron stars may abound there",
    ".    it may be impossible to find radio pulsars in the gc as sources of periodic radio emission , however .",
    "the difficulty arises because radio - wave scattering , which is particularly severe from sources in the gc ( e.g. , sgr  a@xmath1 , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and several oh / ir stars , @xcite ; @xcite ) , broadens pulsar pulses by extraordinary amounts .",
    "the actual level of angular broadening toward the gc at 1  ghz is @xmath12 times greater than that predicted by a recent model for the distribution of free electrons in the galaxy ( @xcite ; hereafter tc ) , even though this model includes a general enhancement of scattering toward the inner galaxy . for pulsars in the gc ,",
    "the resultant pulse broadening is at least 100 times larger than predicted by the tc model .",
    "the tc model purposely excluded an explicit treatment of the electron density in the gc , primarily because it would have been , at best , poorly quantified .",
    "more recent data on angular broadening of gc sources , however , now allows us to estimate the amount by which pulse broadening should be augmented .",
    "our results complement recent work ( @xcite ) that suggests a paucity of pulsars inside of the molecular ring at galactocentric radius @xmath13  kpc .",
    "johnston  ( 1994 ) considered a large - scale region toward the inner galaxy and did not discuss the immediate vicinity of the gc .",
    "pulse broadening is so large in the gc that , at conventional frequencies used for pulsar searches , 0.41.4  ghz , the pulsed flux is orders of magnitude too small to be detected , as we show below .",
    "the strong frequency dependence of pulse broadening ( @xmath14 ) suggests that frequencies at much higher frequencies , 520  ghz , will mitigate the effects of scattering .",
    "but pulsar spectra generally decline at higher frequencies , sometimes precipitously , making this option unlikely to find many pulsars",
    ". however , some pulsars have been detected at frequencies as high as 30  ghz ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . though these are relatively nearby objects",
    ", their detections suggest that some pulsars may show sufficient spectral flattening that they would be detectable if as far as the gc .    in this paper",
    "we discuss pulse broadening from sources in and beyond the gc .",
    "we show how to optimize a periodicity search in terms of radio frequency and number of harmonics .",
    "we also discuss searches for pulsars as steady sources rather than periodic ones .",
    "namely , we show that aperture synthesis surveys using the very large array ( vla ) , for example , should be successful in finding objects with pulsar - like spectra and polarization .    in  [ sec : geometry ]",
    "we detail the assumed geometry and angular broadening . in  [ sec : pulsebroad ] we derive the resulting pulse broadening timescales . ",
    "[ sec : detection ] discusses the pessimistic implications of pulse broadening for pulsar surveys involving periodicity searches . in ",
    "[ sec : imaging ] we argue that aperture synthesis surveys may be more successful than periodicity searches in identifying radio pulsars in the gc . in ",

    "the angular diameter of sgr  a@xmath10 is 1.3  at 1  ghz and scales as @xmath15 , in accord with interstellar scattering ( @xcite ) .",
    "oh / ir stars in the vicinity of the gc also show very heavy scattering , at least for those stars within @xmath16 of sgr  a@xmath10 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we use the measured angular broadening to predict the pulse broadening expected from pulsars in the gc , but with the following caveat : we must assume the location along the line of sight of the scattering `` screen '' that enhances the scattering . as van  langevelde et al .",
    "( 1992 ) discuss , the location of the screen is by no means determined and has implications for the depth of free - free absorption to the gc and the outer scale of the electron - density variations . for now , we treat the location of the screen as a parameter of the overall geometry .",
    "we constrain its location using recent scattering measurements for the gc region ( lazio , cordes & frail  1996 ) .",
    "we model the scattering as arising from a discrete screen , as in the top of fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] .",
    "let @xmath17 be the scattering angle produced by the screen and @xmath18 the observed scattering angle . in the following we assume the small - angle approximation : @xmath19 .",
    "for a source at infinite distance , @xmath20 because the waves incident on the screen are plane waves .",
    "sources at finite distance are scattered less due to wave sphericity .",
    "if the source is at distance @xmath21 and the screen is in front of the source by distance @xmath22 , the observed scattering angle is @xmath23 .",
    "if the scattering screen is very close to the gc , then @xmath24 and the observed scattering diameter of an extragalactic source is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the observed scattering diameter of sgr  a@xmath1 . if the scattering screen is , in fact , associated with the gc ( e.g. , @xmath27  pc ) , then extragalactic sources viewed through the screen necessarily have angular diameters that exceed 1  _ arc  min _ at 1  ghz .",
    "the screen geometry we have utilized is highly idealized .",
    "other , more physical , geometries are also presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] .",
    "the scattering screen may _ surround _ the gc with spherical or cylindrical geometry .",
    "alternately , the scattering region may be distributed throughout the gc region rather than being confined to a thin screen .",
    "yusef - zadeh et al .  ( 1994 ) , for example , interpret anisotropic scattering from sgr  a@xmath1 in terms of regions distributed uniformly within 100  pc of sgr  a@xmath1 .",
    "the scattering from sgr  a@xmath1 may then be _ effectively _ screen - like because it will be dominated by regions farthest from sgr  a@xmath1 ( through geometric effects ) .",
    "however , background sources will be scattered by all regions . in these cases ,",
    "the angular diameters of background sources are at least double what we have derived if the scattering is from a thin screen that surrounds the gc , but it will be even greater for scattering regions that fill the gc .",
    "van  langevelde et al .  (",
    "1992 ) derived a lower bound on the gc - screen distance based on the fact that the free - free optical depth must be @xmath28 at 1.6  ghz : @xmath29^{1/2}. \\label{eq : freefree}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath30 , @xmath31 are the outer and inner scales , respectively , of the electron - density fluctuations ; @xmath32 is the gaunt factor , and @xmath33 is the temperature in units of @xmath34  k. the various parameters can be adjusted to reduce the overall coefficient from 0.1 to  0.004 ( e.g. , through an inner scale of 0.01  pc and a temperature of @xmath35  k ) .",
    "however , even @xmath35  k may be too hot for electron density variations to be sustained ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a scattering screen thinner than 0.01  pc is also improbable because stellar - wind shocks tend to be at least this thickness ( @xcite ) .",
    "the outer scale , which is probably comparable to the screen thickness , can not be reduced much below 0.01  pc .",
    "other evidence also indicates that the inner scale is not less than 100  km .",
    "this includes the observed scaling of scattering diameters as @xmath15 for sgr  a@xmath1 and other heavily scattered sources such as cyg x-3 ( @xcite ; wilkinson , narayan , & spencer  1994 ) and ngc6334b ( @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore take as a hard lower bound , @xmath36  pc .",
    "this suggests that a strong upper bound on the sizes of extragalactic sources is @xmath37 for a screen - like geometry that wraps around sgr  a@xmath1 .",
    "it is possible to determine the screen distance from the galactic center by either measuring the diameters of extragalactic sources or , in the case where severe scattering diminishes our ability to detect sources , use the deficiency of sources to constrain the screen location .",
    "attempts to observe extragalactic sources near sgr  a@xmath1 in fact show a deficiency of sources within 0.5  of sgr  a@xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a likelihood analysis shows that this deficiency is consistent with extragalactic source sizes larger than 0.5  and @xmath38  pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "pulse broadening is a diffraction phenomenon but may be treated with stochastic ray tracing through extended media ( williamson  1972 , 1975 ) .",
    "it has been observed for many pulsars and used to study the distribution of ionized microturbulence in the galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "the pulse broadening due to the screen responsible for the scattering of sgr  a@xmath1 has an @xmath39 time scale @xmath40 where the screen s location along the line of sight is represented by the geometric factor rather than the observed angle @xmath18 .",
    "using @xmath17 , the equivalent geometric factor is @xmath41 , which maximizes at @xmath42 . ]",
    "@xmath43 the pulse broadening time for fiducial values of the distance ( 8.5  kpc ) and scattering diameter ( 1.3 ) at a frequency of 1  ghz is @xmath44 in eq .",
    "[ eq : taugc ] we have adopted a frequency scaling @xmath45 rather than the often encountered @xmath46 scaling because , in the extremely strong scattering limit , the scattering is dominated by the smallest irregularities in the free electron density that are physically present ( cf .",

    "the geometric factor is @xmath47 if the screen is midway along the line of sight . but",

    "therefore , pulsars at the same location as the gc will show _ at least _",
    "@xmath49  s of pulse broadening at 1  ghz .",

    "the minimal scattering time of @xmath49  s may be compared , at 1  ghz , to the pulse broadening of the most heavily scattered pulsar , psr  b1849@xmath5000 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which is about 0.3  s.    pulsars beyond the gc ( but still behind the scattering screen ) will show even larger scattering . for a pulsar distance @xmath51 ,",
    "the pulsar - screen distance is @xmath52 and the pulse broadening from the screen is @xmath53 as a function of distance from the sun , pulse broadening increases slowly and according to the tc model , which possesses components that grow stronger in the inner galaxy .",
    "then , just beyond the location of the gc scattering screen , pulse broadening increases dramatically and continues to increase . to combine the tc model and the gc screen component",
    ", we write the net pulse broadening as @xmath54 combining the tc and gc - screen scattering times is _ ad hoc _ in form but is sufficiently accurate for our purposes here because the gc component is much larger than the tc contribution .    figure  [ fig : gctau ] shows the pulse broadening at two frequencies ( 1.4 and 10  ghz ) for a range of gc - screen distances , @xmath55 , 0.1 , 0.2 , 1.0 , and 4.25  kpc . for pulsars beyond the gc , the pulse broadening asymptotes to @xmath56  s at 1.4  ghz and 18  s at 10  ghz .",

    "the fraction of objects that exceed the minimum luminosity also decreases in going from 5 to  15  ghz . a key disadvantage to using higher frequencies",
    "is that , all other things being equal , the telescope time needed to search a region of fixed angular size will scale as the solid angle of the telescope beam , @xmath123 .",
    "this amounts to nearly an order of magnitude increase in time needed in going from 5 to  15  ghz .",
    "the results in table  [ tab : p - dm ] are only illustrative .",
    "pulsars show a wide range of spectral indices and there are possible correlations between period and luminosity that we have ignored . also , we have been assuming a constant pulse - broadening value for pulsars in the gc . in actuality , the spatial distribution of pulsars in the gc will create a range of pulse broadening .",
    "the extreme values of pulse broadening we have estimated above will be obtained if the angular distribution of pulsars is concentrated toward sgr  a@xmath1 , yet are still quite far from the scattering screen .",
    "however , pulsars spread throughout the region will show a wide range of broadening .",
    "objects close to the screen will show small scattering , asymptotic to the tc value as @xmath124 .",
    "periodicity searches at different ( high ) frequencies will therefore sample the population at different @xmath125 .",
    "scattering preserves the total flux density while attenuating the pulsed flux .",
    "pulsars may therefore be searched for as objects with pulsar - like spectra and polarization in aperture synthesis surveys of the gc .",
    "angular broadening dilutes the surface brightness , but we show here that this dilution denigrates a synthesis survey far less than pulse broadening does a periodicity search .",
    "indeed sgr  a@xmath1 , the oh / ir stars (  [ sec : intro ] ) , and the gc transient ( @xcite ) demonstrate that heavily scattered , yet sufficiently luminous , sources in the gc can be detected with aperture synthesis instruments .",
    "table  [ tab : image ] illustrates detection of pulsars in an imaging survey with the vla .",
    "we assume observations are conducted with a total integration time of 1  hr and total bandwidth @xmath126  mhz at 1.4 and 5  ghz and @xmath127 mhz at 0.33  ghz .",

    "we extrapolate from the current mass of the gc , for an assumed imf , in order to estimate the number of pulsars likely to have formed within the gc .",
    "various methods , summarized by genzel , hollenbach , & townes  ( 1994 ) , constrain the mass enclosed within the central 100  pc to be in the range @xmath133@xmath134  m@xmath135 .",
    "an estimate of the enclosed mass derived from the stellar luminosity distribution , and assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio , is approximately @xmath136  m@xmath135 , which we adopt as a nominal value for the mass interior to 100  pc .",

    "if about 1% of these can be detected , as in an imaging survey using the vla , then only a few to @xmath155 objects are expected to be found . a periodicity search that finds only the 0.1% most luminous pulsars is unlikely to find any pulsars from this population .",
    "one effect which would increase this number is the production of recycled pulsars in binaries resulting from tidal captures and stellar collisions .",
    "the central stellar density may exceed @xmath142  pc@xmath156 , sufficiently high that stellar encounters should be frequent and that processes for recycling pulsars should be operative .",
    "fabian , pringle , & rees  ( 1975 ) estimate the tidal capture rate ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if the number of neutron stars formed in the gc has been @xmath148@xmath143 , then @xmath153 tidal captures or collisions will have occurred over the galaxy s history .",
    "not all of the binaries so formed will produce a recycled pulsar and primordial binary systems could also contribute to the population of recycled pulsars .",
    "regardless of formation mechanism , the detection of a large number of soft , compact x - ray sources toward the gc ( e.g. , @xcite ) supports the possibility of an enhanced number , relative to the disk , of neutron - star binary systems in the gc .",
    "although some of these x - ray sources are probably black - hole systems , the fraction of millisecond pulsars in the total pulsar population in the gc could nevertheless be enhanced substantially relative to a value @xmath157 in the disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the fastest spun - up pulsars will not be detectable in a periodicity search , though they may appear in an imaging search .",
    "modestly spun - up pulsars with lifetimes 10100 times longer than those of most pulsars may be the best targets . in this respect",
    "it is interesting that 15% of the spun - up pulsars in a recent listing had periods greater than 100  ms ( @xcite ) , though none of these objects would themselves be detectable if placed at the gc .",
    "the discussion above assumes a constant star formation rate within the gc .",
    "a recent starburst has been invoked ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) to explain one or more features of the gc .",
    "estimates for the age of the burst are @xmath158@xmath142  myr with the total number of neutron stars formed being @xmath159@xmath158 . even if a burst per  se has not occurred , several lines of evidence point to an enhanced star formation rate , relative to the disk rate , during the recent past in the gc .",
    "these include the density of supernova remnants within the central 10 which is double that found in the disk ( @xcite ) , and the presence of a large number of shell and arc structures in molecular gas , also suggestive of recent supernova activity ( @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated range of ages for the most recent starburst is sufficiently small that all of the pulsars formed during the burst should still be active .",
    "high velocity pulsars will escape the gc in a time short compared to the burst .",
    "indeed , hartmann  ( 1995 ) advocates searches for these escaped pulsars as a means for diagnosing the recent star formation history in the gc . depending upon the number of neutron stars created in the burst ,",
    "the total number of pulsars in the gc from the low - velocity tail of the pulsar velocity distribution could number @xmath160@xmath35 .",
    "that is , the number of active pulsars from the burst population could exceed that from a constant star formation rate over the history of the gc",
    ".    the number of detectable pulsars will be smaller than the total number active and within the gc due to selection effects .",
    "in   [ sec : detection ] and [ sec : imaging ] we estimated the fraction of pulsars sufficiently luminous to be detected , @xmath161 , based on the local pulsar luminosity function .",
    "this fraction is @xmath162@xmath163 , depending upon the search method and frequency .",
    "taking into account the non - isotropic nature of pulsar emission , the resulting fraction of detectable pulsars is @xmath151@xmath164 .",
    "thus , the number of active , detectable pulsars from the central 100  pc of the galaxy could be @xmath165 to as many as 100",
    ". a constant star formation rate over the gc s history will likely contribute @xmath166 pulsars to the total number detectable .",
    "we conclude this section with a brief discussion of the utility of pulsars for constraining the dynamics and star formation history of the gc .",
    "the number of pulsars detected , together with a careful accounting for selection effects , can be used to constrain the past star formation rate of the gc . if any pulsars can be detected as sources of pulsed emission , the distribution of spin periods ; their period derivatives , @xmath167 ; and dispersion measures , dm , and pulse broadening should also be measurable .",
    "the distribution of periods can be used in estimating the past star formation rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "measurement of @xmath167 has the potential to constrain the gc gravitational potential , much like the determination of a negative @xmath167 for b2127@xmath8411 has set limits on its acceleration from the potential of the globular cluster m15 ( @xcite ) . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] , the most recent model for the galactic distribution of ionized gas has few constraints toward the inner galaxy .",
    "even a few dm and pulse broadening measurements would prove useful for improving substantially our knowledge of conditions there .",
    "moreover , gas velocities , particularly near sgr  a@xmath1 , are large , in some cases exceeding 100 km  s@xmath144 ( schwarz , bregman , & van  gorkom  1989 ) .",
    "dm monitoring programs can expect to detect changes in the dm on time scales of a month , which in turn could be used to probe the au - scale structure of ionized gas in the gc .",
    "even if pulsars can only be detected in an imaging survey , their angular diameters would still provide both constraints on the distribution and a probe of the small - scale structure of ionized gas in the gc .",
    "finally , the clock - like nature of pulsars has prompted speculation about their utility for studying the constituents and mass distribution in the gc .",
    "wex , gil , & sendyk  ( 1996 ) and , earlier , paczynski & trimble  ( 1979 ) have discussed the microlensing and gravitational time delay of gc pulsars .",
    "the time delay , in particular , can be used to constrain the mass of any central object .",
    "such determinations , however , will be possible at only the highest frequencies where pulsed emission is manifested .",
    "the extreme level of scattering seen toward the galactic center ( 1.3  of broadening for sgr  a@xmath1 at 1  ghz ) produces considerable pulse broadening . the amount of pulse broadening depends upon the galactic center - scattering screen distance , @xmath131 , but at minimum , the pulse broadening is 6.3  _",
    "seconds_. if the screen is closer to the galactic center , the pulse broadening is increased .",
    "radio pulsars within about 151  of sgr  a@xmath1 and behind the gc scattering screen will only be detected by periodicity searches conducted at frequencies much higher than used heretofore _ or _ by imaging surveys .",
    "periodicity searches at 5  ghz will be capable of detecting pulsars with canonical spin periods @xmath128  s , though with much reduced sensitivity if @xmath168 . at 10  ghz , pulse broadening of millisecond pulsars is a significant fraction of a period even if @xmath169 . if @xmath170  pc , pulsars with periods shorter than @xmath171  s at 5  ghz and 34  ms at 10  ghz will be inaccessible . to reach pulsars with the crab pulsar s period ( 33  ms ) such",
    "that a 10% duty cycle pulse may be seen without broadening , the observing frequency must be at least 18  ghz . while the crab pulsar itself is undetectable at this frequency , other young pulsars with shallower spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) may be strong enough .",
    "such objects are rare , so we conclude that imaging surveys at fairly low frequencies ( e.g. , 1.4  ghz ) are much more likely to be successful in finding galactic center pulsars .",
    "the optimal frequency for conducting any periodicity searches is that which maximizes the pulsed flux density and is given by @xmath172 ( eq .  [ eq : critfreq2 ] ) .",
    "the effective duty cycle of a scattered pulsar at the optimal frequency is @xmath173 and suggests that search algorithms need not consider more than @xmath82 harmonics in the dft .",
    "the angular broadening for a pulsar at the gc will be similar to that of sgr  a@xmath1 ; the broadening for a pulsar more distant than sgr  a@xmath1 but seen through the same scattering screen is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : theta_psr ] .",
    "these angular sizes are well matched to the synthesized beams of the vla in its four configurations .    finally , the number of pulsars detectable in the galactic center depends upon the star formation history of the galactic center .",
    "the largest number of detectable pulsars will occur if the gc has undergone a recent episode ( @xmath174  yr ) of massive star formation .",
    "the number of active , detectable pulsars in the gc may be as many as 100 .",
    "smaller starbursts and the star formation over the galaxy s history can contribute another 110 pulsars .",
