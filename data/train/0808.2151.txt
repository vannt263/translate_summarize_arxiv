    "the many - particle green function approach @xcite allows for a systematic study of macroscopic properties of correlated systems .",
    "green functions know a long history of applications in solid state theory @xcite , nuclear @xcite , and hadron physics @xcite , and also in the theory of strongly coupled plasmas @xcite . in the latter case , optical and dielectric properties",
    "@xcite have been studied using the green function approach , as well as transport properties like conductivity @xcite and stopping power @xcite , and the equation of state @xcite .",
    "modifications of these quantities due to the interaction among the constituents can be accessed , starting from a common starting point , namely the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the key quantity to electronic properties in a correlated many - body environment is the electron spectral function @xmath4 , i.e. the probability density to find an electron at energy ( frequency ) @xmath5 for a given momentum @xmath6 .",
    "it is related to the retarded electron self - energy @xmath7 via dyson s equation @xmath8 ^ 2+\\left [ \\mathrm{im}\\,\\sigma(\\mathbf{p},\\omega+i\\delta ) \\right]^2}~.",
    "\\label{eqn : dyson}\\ ] ] here , the single - particle energy @xmath9 has been introduced , @xmath10 is the electron chemical potential .",
    "note that here and throughout the paper , the rydberg system of units is used , where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , the boltzmann constant @xmath14 is set equal to 1 , i.e. temperatures are measured in units of energy .",
    "the self - energy describes the influence of correlations on the behaviour of the electrons .",
    "a finite , frequency dependent self - energy leads to a finite life - time of single - particle states and a modification of the single - particle dispersion relation .",
    "hence , the calculation of the electron self - energy is the central task if one wants to determine electronic properties , e.g. those mentioned above .",
    "the hartree - fock approximation @xcite represents the lowest order in a perturbative expansion of the self - energy in terms of the interaction potential @xcite . being a mean - field approximation ,",
    "effects due to correlations in the system can not be described .",
    "examples are the appearance of collective modes , the energy transfer during particle collisions , and the quasi - particle damping .",
    "the next order term is the born approximation , where binary collision are taken into account via a bare coulomb potential .",
    "however , the born approximation leads to a divergent integral , due to the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "therefore , the perturbation expansion of the self - energy has to be replaced by a non - perturbative approach , accounting for the dynamical screening of the interparticle potential .",
    "a non - perturbative approach to the many - particle problem is given by the theory of dyson @xcite and schwinger @xcite generalized to finite temperature and finite density @xcite .",
    "an excellent introduction to dyson - schwinger equations can also be found in @xcite .",
    "the dyson - schwinger equation for the self - energy @xmath15 contains the full green function @xmath16 , the screened interaction @xmath17 and the proper vertex @xmath18 .",
    "since each of these functions obeys a different dyson - schwinger equation itself , involving higher order correlation functions , the dyson - schwinger approach leads to a hierarchy of coupled integro - differential equations . in order to provide soluble equations , this hierarchy has to be closed at some level , i.e. correlation functions of a certain order either have to be parametrized or neglected .",
    "one such closure of the dyson - schwinger hierarchy consists in neglecting the vertex , i.e. the three - point function , and considering only the particle propagators and their respective self - energies , i.e. two - point functions .",
    "one arrives at the so - called @xmath19-approximation , introduced in solid - state physics by hedin @xcite .",
    "hedin was led by the idea , to include correlations in the self - energy by replacing the coulomb potential in the hartree - fock self - energy by the dynamically screened interaction @xmath17 . in this way",
    ", one obtains a self - consistent , closed set of equations for the self - energy , the polarization function @xmath20 , the green function and the screened interaction .",
    "it can be shown @xcite , that the @xmath19 approximation belongs to the so - called @xmath21-derivable approximations @xcite .",
    "as such , it leads to energy , momentum , and particle number conserving expressions for higher order correlation functions .",
    "it was successfully applied in virtually all branches of solid state physics . an overview on theoretical foundations and applications of the @xmath19 approximation",
    "can be found in the review articles @xcite .",
    "the drawback of the @xmath19 approximation is , that the ward - takahashi identities are violated .",
    "ward - takahashi identities provide an exact relation between the vertex function @xmath18 , i.e. the effective electron - photon coupling in the medium , and the self - energy and follow from the dyson - schwinger equations .",
    "they reflect the gauge invariance of the theory . in @xmath19 , they are violated simply because corrections to the vertex beyond zero order are neglected altogether .",
    "this issue touches on a fundamental problem in many - body theory and field theory , namely the question how to preserve gauge invariance in an effective , i.e. approximative theory , without violating basic conservation laws .",
    "a detailed analysis of this question with application to nuclear physics is presented in a series of papers by van hees and knoll @xcite .",
    "approximations for the self - energy , that also contain the vertex are often referred to as @xmath22 approximations .",
    "an example can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the spectral function of electrons in aluminum is calculated using a parametrized vertex function .",
    "an interesting result obtained in that work is that vertex corrections and self - energy corrections entering the polarization function , largely cancel .",
    "this can be understood as a consequence of ward - takahashi identities .",
    "thus , and in order to reduce the numerical cost , it is a sensible choice to neglect vertex corrections altogether , and to keep the polarization function on the lowest level , i.e. the random phase approximation ( rpa ) which is the convolution product of two non - interacting green functions in frequency - momentum space .",
    "the corresponding self - energy is named the @xmath0 self - energy and has been introduced by von barth and holm @xcite , who were also the first to study the fully self - consistent @xmath19 approximation @xcite . throughout this work , the @xmath0 self - energy will be analyzed .",
    "having been used in solid state physics traditionally , the @xmath0-method was also applied to study correlations in hot and dense plasmas , recently .",
    "the equation of state @xcite , as well as optical properties of electron hole plasmas in highly excited semiconductors @xcite , and dense hydrogen plasmas @xcite were investigated .",
    "in general , the calculation of such macroscopic observables of many - particle system involves numerical operations that need the spectral function as an input .",
    "since the self - consistent calculation of the self - energy , even in @xmath0-approximation , is itself already a numerically demanding task , it is worth looking for an analytic solution of the @xmath0 equations , which reproduces the numerical solution at least in a certain range of plasma parameters .",
    "such an analytic expression then also allows to study the self - energy in various limiting cases , such as the low density limit or the limit of high momenta , which are difficult to access in the numerical treatment .",
    "furthermore , an analytic expression , being already close to the numerical solution permits the calculation of the full @xmath0 self - energy using only few iterations .",
    "analytical expressions for the single - particle self - energy have already been given by other authors , e.g. fennel and wilfer @xcite and kraeft et al .",
    "they calculated the self - energy in first order of the perturbation expansion with respect to the dynamically screened potential .",
    "besides being far from the converged @xmath0 self - energy , their result is independent of density , i.e. the single - particle life - time is finite even in vacuum .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this unphysical behaviour is a direct consequence of the perturbative treatment . by using a non - perturbative ansatz , an expression for the self - consistent self - energy in a classical one - component plasma",
    "was presented , that reproduces the full @xmath0 self - energy at small momenta , i.e. for slow particles .",
    "the behaviour of the quasi - particle damping at larger momenta remained open and will be investigated in the present work .",
    "secondly , based on the information gathered about the low and high momentum behaviour , an interpolation formula will be derived , that gives the quasi - particle damping at arbitrary momenta .",
    "the work is organized in the following way : after a brief outline of the @xmath0-approximation in the next section , numerical results will be given in section [ sec : numresults ] for the single - particle spectral function for various sets of parameters electron density @xmath23 and electron temperature @xmath24 . in section [ sec : analyticexpression ] the analytic expression for the quasi - particle damping width is presented and comparison to the numerical results are given .",
    "section [ sec : chempot ] deals with the application of the derived formulae to the calculation of the chemical potential as a function of density and temperature .",
    "an appendix contains the detailed derivation of the analytic self - energy . as a model system ,",
    "we focus on the electron one - component plasma , ions are treated as a homogeneously distributed background of positive charges ( jellium model ) .",
    "we start our discussion with the integral equation for the imaginary part of the single - particle self - energy in @xmath0 approximation : @xmath25 @xmath26 is the fourier transform of the coulomb potential with the normalization volume @xmath27 .",
    "it is multiplied by the inverse dielectric function in rpa , @xmath28 to account for dynamical screening of the interaction .",
    "furthermore , the fermi - dirac and the bose - einstein distribution function , @xmath29^{-1}$ ] , were introduced .",
    "note , that the dielectric function is only determined once , at the beginning of the calculation .",
    "in particular , the single - particle energies @xmath30 entering equation ( [ eqn : epspi ] ) are determined from the non - interacting chemical potential , whereas during the course of the self - consistent calculation of the self - energy , the chemical potential is recalculated at each step via inversion of the density relation @xmath31 using the self - consistent chemical potential also in the rpa polarization function leads to violation of the @xmath32-sum rule , i.e. conservation of the number of particles .    the real part of the self - energy is obtained via the kramers - kronig relation @xcite all quantities ( spectral function , self - energy , and chemical potential ) have to be determined in a self - consistent way .",
    "this is usually achieved by solving equations ( [ eqn : dyson ] ) , ( [ eqn : sigmacorr_010 ] ) , and ( [ eqn : densityrelation ] ) iteratively.the numerical algorithm is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the spectral function was calculated for the case of a hot one - component electron plasma .",
    "temperature and density were chosen such , that the plasma degeneracy parameter @xmath33 is always larger than 1 , i.e. the plasma is non - degenerate .",
    "furthermore , the temperature is fixed above the ionization energy of hydrogen , @xmath34 , such that bound states can be neglected in the calculations . at lower temperature ,",
    "bound states have to be include , e.g. via the t - matrix . for an application in electron - hole plasmas ,",
    "see reference @xcite .",
    "the electron density is adjusted such that the the plasma coupling parameter @xmath35 which gives the mean coulomb interaction energy compared to the thermal energy , is smaller than 1 in all calculations , i.e. we are in the limit of weak coupling .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sf_3d_n7e+21 ] , we show contour plots of the spectral function in frequency and momentum space for two different densities ( @xmath36 , upper graph ) and ( @xmath37 , lower graph ) .",
    "the temperature is set to @xmath38 in both calculations .",
    "the free particle dispersion @xmath39 is shown as solid black line .    in the first case ,",
    "the plasma is classical ( @xmath40 ) and weakly coupled ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the spectral function is symmetrically broadened and the maximum is found at the free dispersion , i.e. there is no notable quasi - particle shift at the present conditions . at increasing momentum , the width of the spectral function decreases , and the maximum value increases ;",
    "the norm is preserved .    the situation changes , when we go to higher densities , cf .",

    "the chosen parameters are typical solar core parameters @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy parameter is now @xmath42 and the coupling parameter is @xmath43 .",
    "the increased degeneracy and coupling result in a significant modification of the spectral function as compared to the low density case : a shift of the spectral function s maximum to smaller frequencies is observed , the hartree - fock shift .",
    "the shift due to dynamic correlations is still small at the present conditions ; it becomes important in strongly degenerate systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , shoulders appearing in the wings of the main quasi - particle peak at small momenta , indicate the excitation of new quasi - particles , so - called plasmarons @xcite .",
    "they can be seen more clearly in figure  [ fig : sf_gw - gauss_n7e25_t1000 ] ( solid curve ) .",

    "the plasmarons merge into the central peak . as in the low - density case , the position of the maximum approaches the single - particle dispersion , due to the decreasing hartree - fock shift at high @xmath46 .",

    ", one can observe an increase of the spectral function s width with increasing density and with increasing temperature .",
    "the increase with density is due to the increased coupling , while the increase with temperature reflects the thermal broadening of the momentum distribution function @xmath55 that enters the self - energy and thereby also the spectral function . from these results",
    ", we see that the spectral function has a quite simple form in the limit of low coupling , i.e. at low densities and high temperatures .",
    "the numerical results are compared to a gaussian ansatz for the spectral function , shown as the dashed curve in figures [ fig : sf_gw - gauss_n7e19 ] - [ fig : sf_gw - gauss_n7e25_t1000 ] .",

    "the dashed curve shows @xmath56 as obtained from the analytic formula that will be derived in the now following section .",
    "the solution of the @xmath0-equation ( [ eqn : sigmacorr_010 ] ) requires a considerable numerical effort . so far",
    "( see e.g. the work by fennel and wilfer in @xcite ) , attempts to solve the integral ( [ eqn : sigmacorr_010 ] ) analytically were led by the idea to replace the spectral function on the r.h.s . by its non - interacting counterpart , @xmath60 ,",
    "i.e. to go back to the perturbation expansion of the self - energy and neglect the implied self - consistency . at the same time , the inverse dielectric function is usually replaced by a simplified expression , e.g. the born approximation or the plasmon - pole approximation @xcite . whereas the second simplification is indispensable due to the complicated structure of the inverse dielectric function , the first one , i.e. the recursion to the quasi - particle picture , is not necessary , as was shown by the author in ref .",
    "in fact , the result that one obtains in the quasi - particle approximation is far from the converged result , at least in the high temperature case . secondly , using the quasi - particle approximation , the imaginary part of the self - energy is not density dependent , i.e. a finite life - time of the particle states is obtained even in vacuum .",
    "this unphysical result can only be overcome if one sticks to the self - consistency of the self - energy , i.e. if one leaves the imaginary part of the self - energy entering the r.h.s . of equation ( [ eqn : sigmacorr_010 ] ) finite .",
    "using the statically screened born approximation , which describes the binary collision among electrons via a statically screened potential , a scaling law @xmath61 was found @xcite . hence , the spectral functions width vanishes when the plasma coupling parameter @xmath18 ( see equation ( [ eqn : gamma ] ) ) tends to 0 .",
    "an expression for the self - energy was found , that reproduces the converged @xmath0 calculations at small momenta , @xmath62 . at higher momenta ,",
    "the derived expression ceases to be valid .    in this work ,",
    "a different approximation to the dielectric function is studied , namely the plasmon - pole approximation @xcite .",

    "thus , we make the following ansatz for the spectral function : @xmath69 note , that only the hartree - fock contribution to the real part of the self - energy appears , the frequency dependent part is usually small near the quasi - particle dispersion , @xmath70 which therefore can be approximated as @xmath71 . in the following ,",

    "therefore , it appears to be a logical consequence that the validity of the results is limited by the length scale at which typical quantum phenomena become important .",
    "the regime of validity of the analytic formula can also be expressed via the plasma coupling parameter and the temperature as @xmath105 since we restrict ourselves to plasma temperatures , where bound states can be excluded , i.e. @xmath106 , this is equivalent to saying @xmath107 .",
    "although the correspondence between the accurate @xmath0 calculations and the parametrized spectral function at small momenta is not as good as in the case of large momenta , the parametrized spectral function can be applied in the regime of validity to the calculation of plasma observables without introducing too large errors .",
    "as an example , this will be shown for the case of the chemical potential @xmath108 in the next section .",
    "to demonstrate the applicability of the presented formulae for quick and reliable calculations of plasma properties , we calculate the shift of the electron s chemical potential @xmath109 , i.e. the deviation of the chemical potential of the interacting plasma @xmath108 from the value of the non - interacting system @xmath110 .",
    "the chemical potential of the interacting system @xmath108 is obtained by inversion of the density as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath108 , equation ( [ eqn : densityrelation ] ) .",
    "the free chemical potential @xmath110 is obtained in a similar way by inversion of the free density @xmath111    figure [ fig : chempotshift ] shows the shift of the chemical potential as a function of the plasma density @xmath112 for a fixed plasma temperature @xmath53 .",
    "results obtained by inversion of equation  ( [ eqn : densityrelation ] ) using the parametrized spectral function ( [ eqn : gaussdef ] ) with the quasi - particle damping width taken from equation  ( [ eqn : sigma_p_interpolation ] ) ( solid curve ) are compared to those results taking the numerical @xmath0 spectral function ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the @xmath0 result gives slightly smaller shifts than the parametrized spectral function , i.e. the usage of the analytical damping width leads to an overestimation of the the shift of the chemical potential . however , the deviation remains smaller than 20% over the range of densities considered here , i.e. for @xmath104 . at small densities ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath113 , the parametrized spectral function yields the same result as the full @xmath0 calculation .",
    "the deviation at increased density can be reduced by improving the parametrization of the spectral function at small momenta . to this end",
    ", the behaviour of the quasi - particle damping width at high momenta , equation ( [ eqn : finalsolution ] ) should be combined with the frequency dependent solution for @xmath56 at vanishing momentum , as presented in ref .",
    "however , this task goes beyond the scope of this paper , where we wish to present comparatively simple analytic expressions for the damping width that yield the correct low density behaviour of plasma properties .    .",
    "results for @xmath114 using the parametrized spectral function ( solid line ) are compared to full numerical calculations , using the @xmath0-approximation . ]",
    "in this paper , the @xmath0-approximation for the single - particle self - energy was evaluated for the case of a classical one - component electron plasma , with ions treated as a homogeneous charge background .",
    "a systematic behaviour of the spectral function was found , i.e. a symmetrically broadened structure at low momenta and convergence to a sharp quasi - particle resonance at high @xmath46 . at increased densities ,",
    "plasmaron satellites show up in the spectral function as satellites besides the main peak .    in the second part , an analytic formula for the imaginary part of the self - energy at the quasi - particle dispersion @xmath115 was derived as a two - point pad formula that interpolates between the exactly known behaviour at @xmath59 and @xmath116 .",
    "the former case was studied in @xcite , while an expression for the asymptotic case @xmath116 was derived here .",
    "the result is summarized in equation ( [ eqn : sigma_p_interpolation ] ) .",
    "in contrast to previously known expressions for the quasi - particle damping , based on a perturbative approach to the self - energy @xcite , the result presented here shows a physically intuitive behaviour in the limit of low densities , i.e. it vanishes when the system becomes dilute . using the gaussian ansatz ( [ eqn : gaussdef ] ) for the spectral function in combination with the quasi - particle width leads to a very good agreement with the numerical data for the spectral function in the range of plasma parameters , where @xmath1 ; the relative deviation is smaller than 10% under this constraint .",
    "thus , a simple expression for the damping width of electrons in a classical plasma has been found , that can be used to approximate the full spectral function to high accuracy .",
    "this achievement greatly facilitates the calculation of observables that take the spectral function or the self - energy as an input , such as optical properties ( inverse bremsstrahlung absorption ) , conductivity , or the stopping power .",
    "furthermore , it was demonstrated that the derived expressions allow for quick and reliable calculations of plasma properties without having to resort to the full self - consistent solution of the @xmath0-approximation . as an example",
    ", the shift of the chemical potential was calculated using the parametrized spectral function and compared to @xmath0 results . for densities of @xmath117 ,",
    "both approaches coincide with a relative deviation of less than 10% , going eventually up to 20% as the density approaches @xmath118 . at low densities",
    "both approaches give identical results .",
    "this shows the extreme usefulness of the presented approach for the calculation of observables via the parametrized spectral function .    as a furhter important application of the results presented in this paper",
    ", we would like to mention the calculation of radiative energy loss of particles traversing a dense medium , i.e. bremsstrahlung .",
    "a many - body theoretical approach to this scenario is given by knoll and voskresensky @xcite , using non - equilibrium green functions .",
    "they showed , that a finite spectral width of the emitting particles leads to a decrease in the bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "this effect is known as the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect @xcite .",
    "it has been experimentally confirmed in relativistic electron scattering experiments using dense targets , e.g. lead @xcite . in @xcite , it is shown that also thermal bremsstrahlung from a plasma is reduced due to the finite spectral width of the electrons in the plasma . in the cited papers ,",
    "the quasi - particle damping width was either set as a momentum- and energy independant parameter ( in @xcite ) , or calculated self - consistently using simplified approximations of the @xmath0 theory ( in @xcite ) , which itself is a very time - consuming task and prohibited investigations over a broad range of plasmas parameters .",
    "now , based on this work s results , calculations on the level of full @xmath0 become feasible , since analytic formulae have been found that reproduce the @xmath0 self - energy .",
    "effects of dynamical correlations on the bremsstrahlung spectrum can be studied starting from a consistent single - particle description via the @xmath0 self - energy .",
