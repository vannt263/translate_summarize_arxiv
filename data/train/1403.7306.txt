    "electron transport in graphene with an applied split gate voltage is akin to light propagating through a metamaterial with negative refractive index .",
    "this analogue can be used to understand the focusing of electric current by a single p - n junction in graphene and was theoretically predicted in a seminal work by cheinov _",
    "it was shown that for the case of a symmetric n - p junctions when @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the wave number in the @xmath2 region , the n - p junction provides perfect focusing of the emitted electrons on the p - side . however , for the case of asymmetric n - p junctions when @xmath3 , the sharp focus transforms into a pair of _ caustics _ , which in the language of optics corresponds to an envelope of a family of rays ( wavevectors for the electrons ) at which the density of rays is singular .",
    "the cusp - shaped patterns of light reflection on the inside of a coffee cup , the patterns of bright lines observed on the bottom of a swimming pool and the common rainbow are some prime examples of this phenomenon occurring in the nature .",
    "since the rays in geometrical optics are analogous to classical trajectories of electrons , the concept of _ caustics _ has already been taken forward to atomic @xcite and nuclear scattering experiments @xcite where an analogous to rainbow phenomena have been observed .",
    "observation of caustics in the trajectories of cold atoms in a linear magnetic potential @xcite have also been reported .",
    "such focusing and caustic formation of charge carriers also arises in circular n - p junctions of monolayer graphene @xcite . the scattered wave function of an incoming plane wave of electrons due to a circular symmetric step - like potential shows an interference pattern which resembles that of ` cup - caustics ' @xcite [ _ c.f _ fig .",
    "[ cupcaustics ] ] , with high intensity maximum located around the caustics that can be calculated from snell s law with negative refractive index @xcite .",
    "complex caustics patterns have also been demonstrated in the presence of rashba spin - orbit interaction in circular gated or doping - controlled region in graphene @xcite .",
    "this was shown to result in selective focusing of different spins , and the possible direct measurement of the rashba coupling strength in scanning - probe experiments . whereas the focusing and caustic formation can create region of high intensity for electrons in a circular p - n junction",
    ", one may ask what will happen to the probability distribution in presence of a suitable magnetic field .",
    "such a query is motivated by the fact that magnetic barriers of different geometries are known to confine the charge carriers in monolayer graphene that are massless dirac fermions@xcite . whereas the scattering problem of such massless dirac fermions in circular potential barrier and the resulting caustic formation is studied in detail for monolayer @xcite and bilayer @xcite graphene , the fate of such optical analogies for the case of magnetic barriers is yet to be analyzed .",
    "this is because of the localised nature of solutions which occur in the presence of magnetic field .",
    "however , it may be pointed out that interesting the features like periodic spatial modulation of current injected from a point source near a p - n junction in graphene in presence of uniform magnetic field has been predicted and shown to originate from caustic bunching of skipping - snaking orbits @xcite . in the present work , we investigate the wavefunction patterns in the presence of a graphene magnetic dot .",
    "the geometry corresponds to the magnetic field which is constant except within a disk where it vanishes .",
    "one of the ways in which such an inhomogenous magnetic field can be experimentally realized is by depositing a superconducting disk on the top of graphene sheet .",
    "when a homogenous magnetic field is applied perpendicularly , the magnetic flux lines are expelled from the superconducting disk due to meissner effect , which results in the proposed inhomogenous magnetic field profile .",
    "other methods of creating such inhomogeous magnetic field for two dimensional electronic systems was recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "for the case of a non relativistic two -dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) system , such a magnetic field profile was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite to study the bound states and analyse the optical absorption spectrum @xcite of such system .",
    "the energy spectrum for such magnetic dot in graphene has been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum shows a set of bound states below the lowest bulk landau level which can be employed to design and control an artificial atom in such a graphene nanostructure .",
    "this energy spectrum is different from the energy spectrum for schr@xmath4dinger electrons in terms of the energies of the bound states which is a consequence of the different energies of the corresponding landau levels .",
    "it may however be noted that in ref .",
    "@xcite a complementary configuration of the magnetic field was considered , where the magnetic field is nonzero only in a finite , circular disk - like region of space , and vanishes outside that region . in the same work",
    "it has been shown that in such a situation true bound states solutions are not possible and only quasi bound states can be defined .",
    "thus this configuration provides very different spectrum as compared to the case under consideration in this paper .",
    "given this significant change in the energy spectrum in the presence of the proposed magnetic field profile we investigate that what will happen to the caustic formation of the dirac electron wave functions of monolayer graphene in circular p - n junctions .    the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we begin with understanding the scattering of incident plane wave of ballistic electrons on a circular potential step and obtain the interference pattern which resembles ` cup caustics ' that can be described in terms of geometrical optics . in the next section , for the case of a magnetic dot , we consider the electrons to be incident ( in all directions ) from inside the dot which is the field free region , and analyze the interference patterns . the results and discussion as well as the description in terms of classical treatment",
