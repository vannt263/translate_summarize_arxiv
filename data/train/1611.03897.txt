    "<S> this can not be explained using the kramers approach in which , as shown above , the escape rate increases with increasing curvature for a fixed barrier height . </S>",
    "<S> note that in the kramers approach one considers a potential well rather than a single barrier that does not surround the particle . </S>",
    "<S> an ideal experimental study to test our theoretical results would correspond to studying the transition rate in a double - well potential of equal depth but different widths . </S>",
    "<S> it will also be very interesting to extend the kramers approach to particles escaping over an asymmetric barrier .    in conclusion , we derived an effective interaction potential for active particles in a one - dimensional potential well of finite depth . using this effective potential we calculated the escape rate of active particles over the potential barrier . for the problem considered , </S>",
    "<S> this approximate procedure turns out to be ( i ) well justified , as no tensorial effective quantities occur and no pairwise interaction forces are involved which both would require further approximations , ( ii ) highly accurate although the potential considered has a negative curvature , ( iii ) particularly simple , as all conditions are respected to justify expansion methods and ( iv ) the ideal link to kramers approach for passive particles . as our main result we obtained and discussed a closed analytic formula for the escape rate . </S>",
    "<S> we find that upon increasing the activity or the curvature at the maximum of our model potential , the effective equilibrium approach only slightly overestimates the escape rate of active particles compared to computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> similar calculations can be made involving any other trapping potential . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to set up an experiment or adapt existing ones @xcite to test our theoretical predictions . </S>"
