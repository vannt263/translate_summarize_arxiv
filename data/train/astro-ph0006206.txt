    "1999 ) , initially at @xmath11 , during the course of 8  hr of nearly continuous monitoring , by employing the image subtraction technique of tomaney & crotts ( 1996 ) to search the entire field at once for variable objects .",

    "a key question about energetic bursts such as this one is whether evidence for collimation can be found , and the extent to which such jet behavior reduces the total inferred energy to a value compatible with that available in compact - object binaries .",
    "the principal manifestation of a jet geometry is a gradual achromatic steepening of the light curve to a @xmath22 decay after the edge of the jet becomes visible and shortly thereafter begins to spread laterally ( panaitescu , mszros , & rees 1998 ; rhoads 1999 ; sari , piran , & halpern 1999 ; moderski , sikora , & bulik 2000 ; kumar & panaitescu 2000 ) .",
    "alternatively , such a steepening may occur when the jet becomes non - relativistic ( huang , dai , & lu 1999,2000 ) . in this paper , we present evidence for a jet in .    also of interest",
    "is any information that can be gleaned about the environment in which the burst occurs , and what this suggests about the possible progenitor star(s ) .",
    "the spectral and temporal evolution of the afterglow can distinguish between a uniform interstellar medium ( ism ) , and a nonuniform medium of density @xmath23 , e.g. , as is appropriate for a pre - existing stellar wind ( chevalier & li 1999,2000 ) .",
    "we will argue that the afterglow observations of  are more consistent with a uniform ism .",
    "optical and ir photometry of  was collected at various telescopes as listed in table  1 .",
    "we placed all of the optical observations on a common @xmath24 system using the calibrations made of this field by henden , guetter , & vrba ( 1999 ) . in this system , stars a and b in figure  1 have @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "except for the final point on january 13 , all of the mdm data were obtained through non - standard broad @xmath27 and @xmath28 filters which we calibrated using 66 landolt ( 1992 ) standard stars .",
    "the rms scatter in the fitted transformation is 0.024 mag , which we have included in table  1 as a systematic error .",
    "gunn @xmath29 and @xmath30 measurements at palomar and keck were also transformed to @xmath31 and @xmath32 using landolt standards . for the @xmath33 observations at mdm , we used ukirt faint standard stars for calibration . in figure  2",
    "we graph the light curves in @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath34 , together with a model developed for the @xmath27 band as described below .",
    "beginning 10.8  hr after the burst , we obtained a nearly continuous set of @xmath27-band observations for 8  hr on the mdm 1.3 m telescope .",
    "this uniform set of data , shown in figure  3 , can be fitted assuming statistical uncertainties only with a power - law decay of @xmath35 .",
    "the rms scatter about this fit is only 0.019 mag , which is less than the typical statistical uncertainty of 0.03 mag in the individual points .",
    "therefore , we conclude that any intrinsic fluctuation about the mean decay on time scales from 10 minutes to hours is less than 1%",
    ". however , an extrapolation of this power law is strongly inconsistent with the observations after about 3  d. by day  10 , when the extrapolation would predict @xmath36 , we observe @xmath37 . furthermore , there is evidence that the decay flattened after day  20 , which we interpret as the increasing dominance of a host or intervening galaxy . in view of this behavior",
    ", we subtracted a constant flux from each of the data points .",
    "the value of this constant was varied in the range @xmath38 ; the measurement of this contribution is explained in the following paragraph .",
    "after day  1 , all of the corrected data points are well fitted by a steeper decay , @xmath39 .",
    "the error quoted here includes both the statistical uncertainty in the fit ( @xmath40 ) and the the systematic range ( @xmath41 ) introduced by the estimated uncertainty in the subtracted galaxy contribution .",
    "the fit of the late - time slope is dependent upon the interpretation of the latest photometric point as dominated by the constant contribution of a galaxy , which could be either the host or an intervening galaxy in view of the three absorption - line redshifts seen in the optical spectrum of the ot .",
    "here we describe some details of the images that are relevant to this conclusion .",
    "all of the images obtained after day  10 , when we surmise that galaxy contribution became significant , show some extension to the west of the ot , and the penultimate image from january 13 , taken in @xmath42 seeing , looks quite extended .",
    "the final image obtained on 2000 april  3 under similar seeing shows no indication of the ot .",
    "rather , an object extended by @xmath43 in the east - west direction is centered approximately @xmath44 west of the previously measured position of the ot .",
    "in addition , there is a faint galaxy only @xmath45 to the southeast of the ot , which makes it tricky to measure an integrated magnitude for the ot / galaxy at late times .",
    "the estimated total magnitude of the `` host '' galaxy is @xmath3 , but not all of this flux is included in the photometry of the ot . instead",
    ", a lesser contamination of the ot is achieved by measuring its magnitude after day  10 in a @xmath46 radius aperture centered on the ot position .",
    "this procedure produces a relatively robust measurement of the ot plus superposed galaxy contribution .",
    "the galaxy contribution alone _ at the position of the ot _ is measured in the same way on april  3 .",
    "the result is @xmath47 , which is the final @xmath27 magnitude listed in table  1 and the constant that we subtracted from the previous measurements to fit the ot decay curve .",
    "it has become customary to fit such steepening afterglow decays with a smooth function that has asymptotic power - law behavior at early and late times .",
    "one such simple function is @xmath48 here @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent the asymptotic early and late time slopes , @xmath51 is the constant galaxy contribution , and @xmath52 is the ot flux at the cross - over time @xmath53 .",
    "unfortunately , the data on grb  991216 do not permit many interesting constraints on these parameters to be derived .",
    "our experiments with such fits show that @xmath50 could be as steep as 2.1 .",
    "therefore , we consider that @xmath54 is the allowed range on the late - time decay , while @xmath55 is certainly true at early times . there are nt observations at sufficiently early times to constrain an upper limit on @xmath49 , and @xmath53 is essentially unconstrained within a factor of 10 due to the sparse data at late times . in figure  2 , we draw an acceptable fit to equation  1 in which @xmath56 was fixed , which results in best - fitted parameter values @xmath57 , @xmath58  d , and @xmath59 .",
    "the latter is consistent with @xmath60 as the constant contribution of the portion of the host or intervening galaxy which contaminates the ot photometry .",
    "we stress that such a fit is illustrative only . more important",
    ", we note that the decay parameters of  are strikingly similar to that of grb  990123 ( kulkarni et al 1999 ) , the most energetic event yet observed .",
    "it is possible to synthesize a broad - band spectrum from these data by interpolating the magnitudes to a particular time using the observed decay rates .",
    "we chose a time of december 18.34 ut , 40  hr after the burst , which falls close to the largest number of measurements at different frequencies from radio through x - ray .",
    "the interpolated @xmath61 magnitudes were converted to fluxes using standard calibrations , and are graphed as filled circles in figure  4 .",
    "galactic reddening is a significant factor in this field because of its intermediate galactic latitude , @xmath62 .",
    "the selective extinction @xmath63 can be estimated in at least two ways .",
    "first is the value of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis ( 1998 ) from the _ iras _",
    "@xmath64 m maps , @xmath65  mag .",
    "this is significantly larger than a second estimate , @xmath66  mag , which can be derived from the galactic 21 cm column density in this direction , @xmath67  @xmath9 ( zhang & green 1991 ; stark et al .",
    "1992 ) , and the standard conversion @xmath68  @xmath9  mag@xmath18 ( savage & mathis 1979 ) .",
    "it is likely that h  i underestimates the extinction to  because this position falls on the edge of a co cloud that is part of an expanding molecular and dust ring energized by the @xmath69  orionis h  ii region @xmath70 away ( maddalena & morris 1987 ; zhang et al .",
    "associated with this co cloud is the lynds ( 1962 ) dark nebula ldn  1571 , only @xmath71 from .",
    "figure  4 shows the results of applying each of these extinction corrections . in neither case",
    "is the dereddened spectrum a good fit to a power law , although illustrative extreme fits are drawn corresponding to the two suggested values of the extinction . in particular , the turn - down in the @xmath72 band is puzzling in view of the higher radio flux which was observed at @xmath73  mjy on several occasions before and up to this time ( taylor & berger 1999 ; rol et al . 1999 ; pooley 1999 ; taylor & frail 1999 ) .",
    "such a break would require a concave upward inflection at longer wavelengths , which is not accommodated by any afterglow model .",
    "a similar peak was seen in the ir photometry of grb  971214 ( ramaprakash et al .",
    "1998 ) , but it too could not be satisfactorily explained ( wijers & galama 1999 ) in a manner consistent with all of the other data on that burst . in the case of , additional ir data which do not show such a peak have been reported by garnavich et al .",
    "in particular , they find @xmath74 on dec . 18.25 , which corresponds to about 45% more flux than our own nearly simultaneous measurement ( @xmath75 on dec .",
    "18.18 ) when extrapolated to the same time .",
    "if our own @xmath72-band point is in error , such a correction would essential restore a power - law form to our optical and ir photometry , so we suspect that this may be the case .",
    "an additional constraint on the spectral slope and extinction can be obtained in a weakly model - dependent way by comparing the extrapolated optical spectrum to the simultaneously measured x - ray flux . in the x - ray",
    ", five measurements were made between 1 and 40 hr after the burst , starting with the @xmath76 all - sky monitor ( asm , corbet & smith 1999 ) , continuing with the @xmath76 pca ( takeshima et al .",
    "1999 ) , and ending with the _ chandra _ high - energy transmission grating ( hetg , piro et al .",
    "all of these x - ray fluxes can be fitted by a power - law temporal decay of index @xmath77 , as noted by the above authors ( see fig .",
    "this decay was used to determine the x - ray flux on december 18.34 shown in figure  6 .",
    "it is evident that the smaller value of the extinction , @xmath66  mag , is probably an underestimate , and that the larger value is possibly an overestimate unless the spectrum steepens from @xmath78 in the optical to at least @xmath79 from the ultraviolet through x - ray .",
    "allowing these extreme limits for galactic extinction , the slope between the @xmath27 band and the 210  kev x - rays can be characterized as @xmath80 , although a broken power law as illustrated in figure  6 is allowed since the x - ray spectrum itself has @xmath81 ( takeshima et al .",
    "1999 ) .    at the beginning of our optical monitoring ,",
    "10.8  hr after the burst , there was also a simultaneous x - ray observation ( takeshima et al .",
    "1999 ) . at that earlier time the @xmath27-band to x - ray spectrum of  can be described by the slightly flatter index @xmath82 , where the error is again dominated by the uncertainty in optical extinction suggested above .",
    "the early - time decay rate and broad - band spectral energy distribution of  from optical through x - ray are consistent with the standard theory of adiabatic evolution in a uniformly dense medium ( e.g. , sari , piran , & narayan 1998 ) . in such a model , a decaying synchrotron spectrum follows the form @xmath83 with @xmath84 in the regime where @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath86 is the index of the power - law electron energy distribution , and @xmath87 is the `` cooling frequency '' at which the electron energy loss time scale is equal to the age of the shock . at frequencies",
    "@xmath88 , the power law steepens by 1/2 to @xmath89 because of synchrotron losses , and @xmath90 decreases by 1/4 to @xmath91 . at a time of 10.8  hr the optical - to - x - ray spectrum of",
    "can be described as @xmath82 . at the same time",
    "the optical decay rate must follow @xmath92 , depending upon whether a simple power law or a dual power - law function is fitted , which is therefore consistent with @xmath93 . since in the x - ray @xmath81 ( takeshima et al .",
    "1999 ) , the overall spectrum is consistent with @xmath87 falling between the optical and x - ray at times between 10.8 and 40  hr , and @xmath94",
    ". extrapolation of the x - ray spectrum to the extension of the optical points shows that @xmath95  hz at 40  hr ( fig .",
    ". only the x - ray decay rate , @xmath96 ( takeshima et  al . 1999 ) , is slightly discrepant from the predicted value which should be @xmath97 .",
    "the gradual steepening of the @xmath27-band decay is in accord with some models of jet - like afterglows .",
    "numerous authors have discussed the possible effects of collimation . at first",
    ", analytic arguments indicated that a steepening of the light curve is expected after the edge of a jet is seen when it slows to a lorentz factor @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the initial opening angle of the jet ( panaitescu et al .",
    "1998 ) . at the same time , or soon thereafter , the jet would begin to spread ( rhoads 1999 ; sari et al .",
    "1999 ) , resulting in an asymptotic decay rate @xmath100 and spectral shape which is constant in time .",
    "other authors have shown through numerical simulations that such a transition , if visible at all , is not very sharp .",
    "the @xmath98 transition produces at best a gradual transition to @xmath101 extended over two orders of magnitude in time ( moderski et al .",
    "kumar & panaitescu ( 2000 ) found that in a uniform density medium the decay index steepens by @xmath102 over a factor of 10 in time .",
    "both of these predictions are consistent with the behavior of , for which @xmath90 in the range 1.5 to 2.1 describes the decay from 2 to @xmath103 days .",
    "it has also been shown that breaks are expected to result from the later transition of a jet to the non - relativistic regime even when they do nt occur earlier in the relativistic phase ( huang et al .",
    "1999,2000 ) .",
    "while the possible causes of temporal breaks in afterglow decays are still uncertain , it is generally agreed that when breaks are seen , collimated jets are likely to be responsible .    if the steepening in the optical decay of  to @xmath104 occurred at 1  d or later , then we need to explain why a steeper x - ray decay ( @xmath105 ) was observed at earlier times . in the context of the @xmath98 transition ,",
    "this might be understood in terms of the evolution of a layered jet , in which the higher - energy emission is concentrated in a narrower core which began to spread earlier .",
    "the jet theory is most consistent with the observations of , while an alternative interpretation of the observed steepening as the passage of the cooling frequency @xmath87 through the optical band is less plausible for three reasons .",
    "first , the expected decay exponent in the cooling regime is only @xmath106 , which is not steep enough to account for the observations at late times .",
    "second , @xmath87 declines as @xmath107 in a spherical afterglow .",
    "since @xmath95  hz is observed at 40  hr , we would expect @xmath108  hz at 3  d , which is still in the extreme ultraviolet .",
    "third , the decay rate in the @xmath28 band through day  3 is at least as steep as it is in the @xmath27 band .",
    "another class of models provides a better fit to several of the grb afterglows , but it is less compatible with .",
    "this is the wind interaction ( chevalier & li 1999,2000 ) , in which the afterglow develops in a nonuniform medium of density @xmath23 as appropriate for a pre - existing stellar wind from a massive stellar progenitor . in the wind model @xmath109 for @xmath85 , and the same evolution as the constant density case applies for @xmath88 . if we make the plausible assumption that @xmath110 , then @xmath111 in a wind environment , and the slow initial decay of  with @xmath92 is difficult to accommodate . alternatively ,",
    "if we hypothesize that @xmath88 at the time of the earliest observations of the afterglow , then the spectral index @xmath112 is too flat to meet the requirement for @xmath89 in this cooling regime , and the observed spectral and temporal steeping in the x - rays is unexplained . in wind models ,",
    "the x - ray decay should not be steeper than the optical decay , which is in contradiction to the observations of .",
    "we conclude that afterglow of  does not show a stellar wind interaction , but behaves like a jet in a uniform ism .",
    "under the assumption that a jet - like grb is collimated into the same solid angle as its early afterglow , sari et al .",
    "( 1999 ) argue that the cross - over time @xmath53 in the afterglow light curve can be related to the @xmath0-ray energy @xmath113 via @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the apparent ( isotropic ) energy in units of @xmath116  ergs , @xmath117 is the ism density in @xmath118 , and @xmath99 is the half opening angle of the jet .",
    "the factor @xmath119 is required if @xmath53 is in the observer s frame . for the case of , with @xmath120  d and @xmath121  ergs , we infer that @xmath122 , and that the energy is reduced by a factor of @xmath6 to @xmath123  ergs , within the range of compact - object coalescence .",
    "even if @xmath124  d , the energy reduction is still a factor of 100 .",
    "however , the assignment of the @xmath0-ray energy to @xmath113 in this analysis is not an obvious choice .",
    "the energy powering the afterglow expansion could be either more or less than the observed @xmath0-rays . as an alternative",
    ", we can estimate the observed energy in the afterglow itself , which is dominated by the x - rays at early times . if we integrate the observed ( 210  kev ) x - ray flux back to a time of 600  s , when its flux would have been @xmath125mjy , comparable to the radio peak , we get @xmath126  ergs  @xmath9 , or almost 10% of the @xmath0-ray burst fluence in less than one decade of frequency .",
    "thus , it seems that we can not be far from wrong in using either the burst or the afterglow energy in equation ( 2 ) .",
    "in particular , we are probably not underestimating the opening angle of the jet .",
    "also , because of the extreme energy , it is unlikely that the jet has become non - relativistic during the times considered here .",
    "for this to have occurred , densities in excess of @xmath127  @xmath118 would be required , and there is little evidence for the excess extinction that would be expected from such an environment .    is the third good example of a jet - like afterglow following grb  990123 ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1999 ) and grb  990510 ( harrison et al . 1999",
    "; stanek et al . 1999 ; beuermann et al . 1999 ) , supporting a trend in which the apparently most energetic @xmath0-ray events have the narrowest collimation _ and _ a uniform ism environment . [ the only other event with a demonstrated isotropic energy @xmath128  ergs was grb  971214 at @xmath129 ( kulkarni et al . 1998 ) , but its afterglow was not well characterized because it was both faint and reddened . ]",
    "chevalier & li ( 2000 ) classified afterglows into two types according to whether their evolution best matches an ism ( constant density ) or stellar wind ( @xmath23 ) environment .",
    "only grb  990123 and grb  990510 definitely fell in the ism category , leading chevalier & li to speculate that these were compact - object mergers .",
    "they also noted an absence of evidence for supernovae associated with these jet - like afterglows , although supernovae may be difficult to see in these hosts at @xmath130 ( bloom et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the case of grb  990510",
    ", no host galaxy has been found to a limiting magnitude of @xmath131 ( fruchter et al .",
    "1999 ; beuermann et al .",
    "although host galaxies as faint as this are not unexpected ( hogg & fruchter 1999 ) , the possibility is at least allowed that grb  990510 occurred outside its parent galaxy .",
    "a massive star is expected to explode close to its birth site , whereas an evolved compact binary may or may not escape its parent galaxy .",
    "if the mechanism of collimation , probably magnetic in nature , can be at least as effective in compact binary mergers as it is in the collapse of a single massive star ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) , then the merger is a plausible origin of jet - like bursts .",
    "however , this would certainly contradict the prevailing theory ( e.g. , fryer , woosley , & hartmann 1999 ) that massive stars are the progenitors of the long - duration grbs which comprise all of the ones that have been localized , while compact binary mergers are responsible for the as - yet unidentifed sources of the short - duration grbs .",

    "<S> the early - time spectral energy distribution of the afterglow can be described as @xmath4 or flatter between optical and x - ray , which , together with the slow initial decay , is characteristic of standard adiabatic evolution in a uniformly dense medium . assuming that a reported absorption - line redshift of 1.02 is correct , the apparent isotropic energy of @xmath5  ergs is reduced by a factor of @xmath6 in the jet model , and the initial half - opening angle is @xmath7 . </S>",
