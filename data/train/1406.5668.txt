    "it is a challenging problem for modeling and simulating non - equilibrium gas flows over a wide range of flow regimes .",
    "the difficulty arises from the different temporal and spatial scales associated with the flows at different regimes .",
    "for instance , for transition or free - molecule flows the typical time and length scales are the mean - collision time and the mean - free - path , respectively , while for continuum flows the hydrodynamic scale is much larger than the kinetic scale . for multiscale flows that involve different flow regimes ,",
    "one popular numerical strategy is to use the hybrid approach , which divides the flow domain into some subdomains and simulating the flow in each subdomain using different modeling according to the specific dynamics @xcite .",
    "for instance , in hybrid particle - continuum approaches , the domain is divided into some macro and micro subdomains , where particle - based methods such as molecular - dynamics ( md ) or direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) are used in the micro parts , while the continuum navier - stokes equations are used in the macro parts .",
    "usually a buffer zone is employed in hybrid methods between neighboring subdomains to exchange flow information using different strategies @xcite .",
    "a common feature of the hybrid method is that they are based on _ numerical coupling _ of solutions from different flow regimes , which are limited to systems with a clear scale separation and may encounter significant difficulties for flows with a continuous scale variation @xcite .    recently",
    ", some efforts have been made to develop numerical schemes for multiscale flows based on kinetic models ( e.g. the boltzmann equation or simplified models ) .",
    "such kinetic schemes attempt to provide a unified description of flows in different regimes by discretizing the same kinetic equation dynamically , so that the difficulties of hybrid methods in simulating cross - scale flows can be avoided .",
    "an example of kinetic schemes is the well - known discrete ordinate method ( dom ) @xcite ) , which is powerful for flows in the kinetic regime , but may encounter difficulties for near continuum flow computation due to the limitation of small time step and large numerical dissipations . in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "some asymptotic preserving ( ap ) schemes were developed ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which can recover the euler solutions in the continuum regime , but may encounter difficulties for the navier - stokes solutions .",
    "therefore , it is still desirable to design kinetic schemes that can work efficiently for flows in a wide ranges of regimes .",
    "the recent unified gas - kinetic scheme ( ugks ) provides a dynamical multiscale method which can get accurate solutions in both continuum and free molecular regimes @xcite .",
    "the ugks is a finite - volume scheme for the boltzmann - bgk equation @xcite , and the particle velocity is discretized into a discrete velocity set , like the dom .",
    "however , the update of the discrete distribution function considers the coupling of particle transport and collision process in one time step , and so the time step is not limited by the collision term .",
    "furthermore , the ugks adopts the local integral solution of the bgk equation in the reconstruction of the distribution function at cell interfaces for flux evaluation , which allows the scheme to change dynamically from the kinetic to hydrodynamic physics according to the local flow condition .",
    "it is noted , however , in the original ugks an additional evolutionary step for macroscopic variables is required such that extra computation costs are demanded .",
    "an alternative simpler ugks method , i.e. , the so - called discrete unified gas kinetic scheme ( dugks ) , was proposed recently @xcite .",
    "this scheme is also a finite - volume discretization of the boltzmann - bgk equation .",
    "but unlike the ugks @xcite , the evolution is based on a modified distribution function instead of the original one , which removes the implicitness in the update process of ugks . at the same time , the evolution of macroscopic variables is not required any more .",
    "furthermore , the distribution function at a cell interface is constructed based on the evolution equation itself instead of the local integral solution , so that the reconstruction is much simplified without scarifying the multiscale dynamics .",
    "the dugks has the same modeling mechanism as the original ugks .",
    "the dugks has been applied successfully to a number of gas flows ranging from continuum to transition regimes @xcite .",
    "the previous dugks is designed for low - speed isothermal flows where the temperature variation is neglected . in many non - equilibrium flows , however , temperature may change significantly ( e.g. high mach number flows ) or change differently from continuum flows ( e.g. micro - flows ) . under such circumstance , it is necessary to track the temperature evolution in addition to the fluid dynamics . in this work , a full dugks is developed for non - equilibrium gas flows where temperature variation is included .",
    "the scheme is constructed based on the bgk - shakhov model which can yield a correct prandtl number in the continuum regime @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the full dugks is presented and some discussions on its properties are presented . in sec .",
    "iii , a number of numerical tests , ranging from subsonic and hypersonic flows with different knudsen numbers , are conducted to validate the method . in sec .",
    "iv , a brief summary is given .",
    "in kinetic theory , the bgk model @xcite uses only one single relaxation time , which leads to a fixed unit prandtl number . in order to overcome this limitation , a number of improved models , such as the bgk - shakhov model @xcite and the ellipsoidal statistical model @xcite ,",

    "we now discuss some important properties of the dugks .",
    "first , we will show the dugks has the asymptotic preserving ( ap ) property @xcite , namely ( i ) the time step @xmath71 is independent of the particle collision time for all knudsen numbers , and ( ii ) the scheme is consistent with the navier - stokes equations in the continuum limit . regarding the time step ,",
    "it is noted that the particle transport and collisions are coupled in the reconstruction of the interface distribution function , which is necessary for an ap scheme @xcite .",
    "this coupling also releases the constraint on the collision - time and the time step as in the operator - splitting schemes , and the time - step can be determined by the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition @xcite , @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the cfl number , @xmath141 is the minimal grid spacing , @xmath142 is the maximum discrete velocity , and @xmath143 is the maximum flow velocity .",
    "@xmath71 determined in this way does not dependent on the relaxation time @xmath11 , and the dugks is uniformly stable with respect to the knudsen number .",
    "regarding point ( ii ) , it is noted that in the continuum limit as @xmath144 , the distribution function in a cell given by eq . can be approximated as @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the slope of @xmath147 at the cell interface @xmath113 .",
    "furthermore , follow the procedure given in the appendix b of ref .",

    "@xcite ) @xmath150 which recovers the chapman - enskog approximation for the navier - stokes solution @xcite .",
    "this fact suggests that the dugks can be viewed as a navier - stokes solver in the continuum limit .",
    "it is also note that the use of the mid - point and trapezoidal rules in eqs . and as well as the linear reconstruction of the distribution function at the cell interface ensures a second - order accuracy in both space and time in the continuum limit .    on the other hand , in the free - molecule limit where @xmath151",

    "finally we point out some key differences between the present dugks and the ugks @xcite which is also designed for all knudsen number flows , although both share many common features such as multi - dimensional nature , ap property , and coupling of particle transport and collision .",
    "the first key difference is that the cell - averaged conserved variables @xmath155 and heat flux @xmath48 in each cell are required to evolve along with the cell - averaged distribution functions in the ugks , because the collision term is discretized with the trapezoidal rule and the evaluation of the implicit part needs these quantities .",

    "the second key difference between dugks and ugks lies in the reconstruction of the distribution function at cell interfaces . in the ugks @xcite ,",
    "the interface distribution function @xmath156 is constructed based on the integral solution of the kinetic equation with certain approximations , while in the present dugks it is constructed based on the characteristic solution which is much simpler .",
    "the third difference is that the dugks is solely based on the single relaxation kinetic model due to its combination of the distribution function and the collision term , but the ugks can be extended to the full boltzmann collision term as well @xcite . despite of these differences , we will show in next section that the present dugks can yield numerical predictions nearly the same as the ugks .    ) and temperature ( @xmath157 ) ; right : stress ( @xmath158 ) and heat flux ( @xmath159 ) .",
