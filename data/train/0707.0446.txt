    "the flavour changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decays of the @xmath0-meson are an important tool for investigating possible physics scenarios beyond the standard model ( sm ) , where such decays are forbidden at tree level .",
    "it is for this reason that fcnc processes are very sensitive to possible small corrections that may be a result of any modification to the sm , or from some new interactions . of",
    "the fcnc decays the radiative mode @xmath6 has been experimentally measured , with a lot of theoretical work also having gone into its study . a related decay ,",
    "@xmath7 , has also been observed experimentally .",
    "this latter process offers many more observables for confrontation with theory ( such as forward - backward ( fb ) asymmetries , polarizations and angular correlations between the final state particles etc . ) , where the theoretical work for this subject has spawned many investigations .",
    "recently the radiative mode @xmath8 has also been observed with good limits also being set on the modes @xmath9 , where the @xmath10 s are the @xmath11 resonances .",
    "the numbers for these rates are comparable to those for the @xmath12 resonance case and we may expect that with more data becoming available the related @xmath13 would be observed just as with the @xmath12 case . furthermore , as with the @xmath12 , such data will provide an independent opportunity to test the predictions of the sm .",
    "in this paper we study the angular distribution of the rare @xmath0-decay @xmath14 , which may be expected to be observed in future b - factories .",
    "we use the standard effective hamiltonian approach , and use the form factors that have already been estimated for the corresponding radiative decay @xmath15 .",
    "the additional form factors for the dileptonic channel are estimated using the large energy effective theory ( leet ) , which enables one to relate the additional form factors to the form factors of the radiative mode .",
    "our results provide , just like in the case of the @xmath12 resonance , an opportunity for a straightforward comparison of the basic theory with experimental results , which may be expected in the near future for this channel .",
    "recall that the physical @xmath16 and @xmath17 states are the mixture of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 state ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath21 state ) states @xcite : k_1(1270 ) & = & k_1a sin+ k_1b cos , + k_1(1400 ) & = & k_1a cos- k_1b sin , [ eq:1 ] where @xmath22 is the @xmath23 mixing angle .",
    "et al._@xcite proposed two possible solutions for this angle , namely @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "of these possibilities the negative values of the mixing angles predict the branching ratio ( br ) of @xmath26 to be more than that of @xmath27 , which is disfavoured from experimental data ( although not ruled out ) . for our work",
    "we have taken the positive values of the mixing angles .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we will give the relevant effective hamiltonian and the leet form factors for the process under consideration . in section",
    "iii we will give the expressions for the differential decay rate for the semi - leptonic decay mode under consideration .",
    "finally we will conlude with our results in section iv .",
    "the short distance contribution to the decay @xmath13 is governed by the quark level decay @xmath28 , and where the sm operator basis can be described by the effective hamiltonian : ^eff & = & v_ts^ * v_tb .",
