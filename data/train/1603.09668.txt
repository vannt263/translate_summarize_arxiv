    "we continue a series of investigations  @xcite on the coupling of dirac particles to curved space  time backgrounds .",
    "foundations of the formalism date back to the time of brill and wheeler  @xcite , and greiner , soffel , mller , and boulware  @xcite , who established the formalism of the spin connection matrices .",
    "modern computer algebra @xcite makes it possible to perform independent evaluations of spin connection matrices for specific space ",
    "time geometries , and the formalism of the foldy  wouthuysen transformation facilitates the identification of the nonrelativistic limit , and leads to a consistent interpretation of the nonrelativistic operators  @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been recalled  @xcite that the dirac equation provides for an ideal tool to study gravitational interactions of antiparticles .",
    "one should recall that the original surprising prediction of the dirac equation  @xcite was the existence of positrons , which are the antiparticles of electrons .",
    "the dirac equation describes particles and their antiparticles simultaneously .",
    "the mass term in the dirac equation is first and foremost the inertial mass .",
    "however , when coupling the particle to curved space - time and identifying the hamiltonian , one can establish a connection of the inertial mass to the gravitational mass because the foldy ",
    "wouthuysen transformed hamiltonian  @xcite contains the gravitational potential ( plus relativistic corrections , of course ) .",
    "on the basis of this consideration , a symmetry relation was found in ref .",
    "@xcite and confirmed in ref .",

    "@xcite holds for specific classes of metrics . on the one hand",
    ", one can show that the reissner ",
    "nordstrm metric ( which describes a charged gravitational center ) belongs to a class of geometries , where a priori , particle  antiparticle symmetry should exist  @xcite , and both particles and antiparticles should be affected identically by the metric . on the other hand ,",
    "we know that the dirac equation can be used to describe charged spin@xmath0 particles , and that particle - antiparticle symmetry does not hold for electromagnetic interactions  @xcite . by definition ,",
    "antiparticles carry the opposite electric charge . how can this apparent contradiction be resolved ?",
    "the answer is that the presence of the explicit covariant coupling to the electrostatic field , not to the gravitational field , breaks the particle - antiparticle symmetry .",
    "it means that we must concern ourselves with the coupling of the dirac particle to the curved space ",
    "time , while at the same time include the electrostatic interaction .",
    "the dirac equation becomes covariant with respect to two gauge groups , the @xmath4 gauge group of quantum electrodynamics and the @xmath5 group of local lorentz transformations .",
    "the double - covariant derivative entails the replacement @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the spin - connection matrix , @xmath8 is the charge of the particle , and @xmath9 is the vector potential  @xcite .",
    "the former covariance is ensured by the four - vector potential @xmath10 in the dirac equation , while the latter is described by the spin - connection matrices @xmath7 , both to be discussed in more detail below .",
    "bound systems featuring both electromagnetic as well as gravitational corrections could be of interest for a number of reasons , not only in the sense of tiny gravitational effects which might be observable in bound systems  @xcite , but also in the context of micro black holes which have been proposed as conceivable candidates for dark matter  @xcite and even classes of novel phenomena at accelerators  @xcite .",
