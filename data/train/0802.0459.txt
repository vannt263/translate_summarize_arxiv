    "when einstein realized his general theory of relativity correctly yielded the precession of the perihelion of mercury , he had heart palpitations , later writing to ehrenfest @xcite , `` for some days i was beyond myself with excitement . ''",
    "the anomalous precession of the perihelion of mercury was the only astronomical observation in conflict with newtonian gravity . even taking account of perturbations from other planets ,",
    "astronomers still saw mercury s perihelion overshoot its keplerian target by an extra @xmath0/century , exactly the amount predicted by general relativity .",
    "just shy of a century later , we are on the brink of another important test of general relativity : the direct detection of gravitational waves .",
    "black hole binaries may be the most viable candidates for a first direct detection .",
    "consequently , and interestingly , the first gravitational waves observed will likely also probe relativistic orbits , which display exotic behaviors beyond even mercury s simple precessing ellipse .",
    "relativistic orbital trajectories need not lie in a plane .",
    "they can also exhibit so - called `` zoom - whirl '' behavior  an extreme form of perihelion precession  whirling around the central black hole before zooming out quasi - elliptically .",
    "nevertheless , even though orbits of a non - spinning test particle around a spinning black hole have been studied since carter proved their integrability in the 1970 s @xcite , a language for making simple , general claims about their properties has been elusive .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a powerful taxonomy that defines the full range of orbital dynamics in the equatorial plane of a kerr black hole .",
    "we use this scheme to illustrate behaviors that run counter even to our relativistic intuitions . in the strong - field regime , precessing elliptical orbits such as mercury s are excluded .",
    "instead , at close separations , eccentric orbits trace out precessions of patterns best described as multi - leaf clovers .",
    "we can also demarcate a region in orbital parameter space where the aforementioned zoom - whirl behavior is not merely prevalent but unavoidable , the size of that region increasing as the spin of the central black hole increases .    *",
    "not all orbits are created equal *    our taxonomy emphasizes a dynamically special set of orbits ",
    "the periodic orbits that return exactly to their initial conditions after a finite time .",
    "first widely touted by poincar @xcite , who suggested that the general behavior of any classical system could be gleaned from a study of repeating motions , periodic orbits have played a crucial role in the treatment of some difficult problems in celestial mechanics , including the motions of planetary satellites , the long term stability of the solar system , and motion in galactic potentials .",
    "in contrast , periodic orbits in relativistic astrophysical systems like compact object binaries have gone largely unexamined , typically with the disclaimer that because they have measure zero in the space of all possible orbits , these closed orbits merit correspondingly little attention . particularly in the case of test particle motion in the schwarzschild and kerr spacetimes  the only analytically soluble relativistic orbital systems ",
    "mapping out the properties of a particular measure zero set has seemed unnecessary .    by contrast",
    ", we will side with poincar . to paraphrase orwell , while all measure zero sets are equal , some are more equal than others .",
    "for instance , circular orbits receive special attention , even though they are also a measure zero set , because they have two special dynamical features :    1 .",

    ", an analysis of circular orbits reveals fairly detailed information about nearby low - eccentricity orbits with relatively low overhead .",
    "most relativity texts derive the famed precession of the perihelion of mercury in precisely this way @xcite .",

    "the latter fact , first noted by poincar , stems from a beautiful correspondence between periodic orbits and the rational numbers .",
    "the density of rationals on the number line thus implies a corresponding density of periodic orbits in the space of all possible orbits , so that any generic orbit can be viewed as an arbitarily small deviation from some exactly periodic counterpart .    the result is a highly geometric skeleton of periodic orbits in terms of which the properties of even generic",
    ", aperiodic orbits can be described .",
    "figure  [ skeleton ] offers a preview of the anatomy of this skeleton .",

    "notice that each aperiodic orbit looks like a slow precession not of an ellipse but of the periodic orbit immediately above .",
    "additionally , each such orbit can be assigned an approximating rational .",
    "what s more , we can describe all black hole orbital dynamics by such a periodic table .",
    "this paper is the first in a series that realizes poincar s dictum for equatorial orbits in the kerr spacetime . after defining and filling out this periodic skeleton for equatorial orbits (  [ tax ] ) ,",
    "we extract its dynamical consequences (  [ dynamics ] ) , and explore its potential applications to a host of astrophysical problems (  [ util ] ) .",
    "in particular , we outline how periodic orbits might facilitate the execution of the computationally intensive task of calculating the gravitational waveforms from extreme mass ratio inspirals .",
    "although important and interesting in its own right , for simplicity of presentation we relegate to an appendix the hamiltonian formalism we use to identify periodic orbits in the kerr system . for the body of the paper , the reader need only know that @xmath1 is the spin parameter for each central black hole and that every orbit is specified by the energy @xmath2 and angular momentum @xmath3 of a test - particle as measured by an observer at infinity .",
    "as detailed in appendix [ kerreqs ] , we work in units in which @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and all coordinates and frequencies are dimensionless .",
    "the goal of this section is to detail a system for indexing all closed orbits around a black hole with a triplet of integers @xmath4 .",
    "the reason behind the choice of symbols will become clear shortly .",
    "the scheme is topological , and our approach is to establish the connection between a given periodic orbit and its @xmath5 label visually .",
    "we then establish the relationship between a given periodic orbit and a specific rational number in two ways : first based on topological features of the orbit , and then based on frequencies associated with its radial and azimuthal motions .",
    "finally , there is the matter of how we know that any particular periodic orbit we reference even exists .",
    "answering this rather important question is the central objective of the dynamical section of the paper ,  [ dynamics ] .",
    "we have a simple topological method for identifying all of the closed orbits for a given angular momentum @xmath3 around a given black hole ( fixed by the spin @xmath1 ) .",
    "each periodic orbit traces out a finite number of leaves before closing .",
    "we will call the number of leaves @xmath6 for zoom .. an immediately recognizable integer associated with each such orbit is the number of leaves it traces out before returning to its starting point .",

    "we will label the vertices of these polygons with a third integer @xmath22 , counting the starting apastron of the orbit as @xmath23 and increasing in the same rotational sense as the orbit ( counterclockwise for prograde orbits , clockwise for retrograde orbits ) , as shown in figure [ ( 4,1,1 ) ] .",

    "these orbits are so central to the discussion of strong - field dynamics that we now briefly outline how they fit into the @xmath4 taxonomy before continuing with the rest of the dynamical discussion .     for @xmath130 .",

    ", each homoclinic orbit has the same energy @xmath133 and angular momentum @xmath134 as the unstable circular orbit to which it asymptotes . when it exists , a homoclinic orbit forms the boundary ( for a given @xmath3 ) between orbits that plunge over the top of the potential ( @xmath135 ) and orbits that do not ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "to see the role of homoclinic orbits in our taxonomy , consider the behavior of a homoclinic orbit that starts at apastron , such as the one in figure [ ( 1,inf,0 ) ] .",
    "as the particle climbs toward the maximum of the effective potential , it asymptotes toward the circular orbit located there and executes an infinite number of whirls . because it never returns to apastron , the homoclinic orbit is not strictly periodic",
    "nevertheless , it is appropriate to think of this single leaf orbit as the @xmath137 limit of the progression of the @xmath138 orbits .",
    "we thus label each homoclinic orbit as @xmath139 , so that each has an associated rational @xmath140 .",
    "it is perhaps surprising that the @xmath141 orbits are bound and have eccentricities @xmath142 .",
    "more specifically , homoclinic orbits with @xmath143 have eccentricities @xmath144 , while those with @xmath145 have @xmath146 . in fact",
    ", the isco _ is _ just the zero eccentricity homoclinic orbit .",
    "properties of homoclinic orbits beyond what is needed for the current discussion , including analytic expressions for their trajectories , can be found in refs ..    since the homoclinic orbit is the maximum energy bound orbit ( for a given @xmath3 , it defines the upper range of allowed periodic orbits , a la eqn.([lims ] ) .",
    "therefore @xmath147 for all @xmath130 .",
    "as always , the lower bound is greater than zero because @xmath44 terminates at a finite value .    to see the consequences of this fact , consider the @xmath148 line in figure [ wvzes ] , which shows a @xmath65 of approximately @xmath149 . by eqn.([lims ] ) , we have the bound @xmath150 for @xmath148 .",
    "we can approximate the lower limit better by going to higher @xmath120 , but these values are sufficient to make a point : there are no mercury type motions .",

    "@xmath169 in the newtonian limit , the upper and lower bounds both approach zero ; keplerian orbits are ellipses .",
    "@xmath169 there is no zoom - whirl behavior in the weak - field regime .",
    "@xmath167 at the isco , the upper and lower @xmath44 bounds both approach @xmath170 because the isco is at once both a circular and a homoclinic orbit and all homoclinic orbits have @xmath141 .",
    "@xmath167 in the very strong - field regime , which we take here to correspond to ( @xmath164 ) , @xmath44 has no upper bound : @xmath171    @xmath167 in the strong - field regime , the simple precessing ellipse familiar from planetary orbits is forbidden .",
    "@xmath167 _ all _ aperiodic eccentric orbits are precessions of low - leaf periodics .",
    "@xmath167 as the isco is approached , _ all _ orbits whirl as well as zoom for any @xmath1 .",
    "our approach  representing the entire black hole dynamics in terms of a periodic skeleton  can be extended to non - equatorial orbits and then applied to astrophysical problems such as gravitational wave astronomy and a dynamical analysis of spinning black hole pairs .",
    "we briefly describe each of these applications in turn .",
    "* non - equatorial orbits * : equatorial orbits yield especially well to a visual rendering of the properties of periodic orbits and their relationship to aperiodic ones .",
    "we focused here exclusively on equatorial orbits for precisely those pedagogic reasons .",
    "already underway , our next order of business is to extend the periodic orbit analysis to non - equatorial kerr geodesics .",
    "generic non - equatorial trajectories can look complex particularly for high eccentricities and incliniations in the strong - field @xcite .",
    "still , periodic orbits must exist .",
    "just as in the equatorial case periodic orbits will correspond to rational numbers . identifying",
    "the ordering of those rationals with respect to those orbital parameters should offer an elegant and illuminating description of the dynamics .",
    "framing the non - equatorial periodic skeleton is not a solely academic enterprise .",
    "the modeling of extreme mass ratio inspirals ( emris ) of compact objects into rotating supermassive black holes relies heavily on non - equatorial kerr dynamics .    *",
    "gravitational wave astronomy : * compact objects orbiting supermassive black holes in galactic centers are expected to be plentiful sources for gravitational waves in the lisa bandwidth .",
    "tens of thousands of such compact objects populate our own galactic center . through gravitational scattering",
    ", a stellar mass compact object can be thrown into a highly eccentrc orbit in the strong - field regime @xcite .",
    "we have shown that all eccentric orbits show zoom behavior of some sort  that is to say , a pattern of discernible leaves  and large ranges of @xmath3 and @xmath2 generate whirl behavior ( figures [ sch ] and [ kerr ] ) .",
    "in particular , in the strong - field regime , we should not expect eccentric orbits to be characterized by precessing ellipses , but rather by the precession of multi - leaf orbits .",
    "these emris will therefore show the zoom - whirl behavior taxonomized in this paper .",
    "so far we have only described the conservative dynamical system .",
    "astrophysical objects orbiting near a massive black hole will radiate gravitational waves and veer off geodesics under the effects of dissipation .",
    "a study of adiabatic inspiral through periodic orbits might offer computational advantages .",
    "for instance , periodic orbits should have more rapidly converging fourier series , than aperiodic ones . additionally , the evolution of the conserved quantities @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath172 may not be independent , thereby cutting down dramatically on the computational expenses .",
    "closed orbits also show promise as a benefit to signal extraction from the gravitational wave observatories in a time - frequencey analysis .",
    "furthermore , the templates of aperiodic orbits , where required @xcite , might be suitably replaced by periodic tables .    * spinning pairs : * the kerr orbits are only integrable in the case of non - spinning test particles .",
    "if the companion spins , a constant of integration is lost ( namely @xmath172 ) and the dynamics is no longer integrable . while many of the other techniques for studying the dynamics may not generalize to spinning pairs",
    ", periodic orbits still define the skeleton of the phase space . even if no clean taxonomy for those orbits exists , a search for and analysis of periodic orbits should reveal general properties of the dynamics .",
    "further , it is already known that spinning pairs can exhibit chaos . treating spin of the companion as a perturbation to kerr motion , the progression of closed oribts under that perturbation could track the transition to chaos . as the companion spin increases ,",
    "the periodic orbits proliferate and the homoclinic orbit is replaced with a homoclinic tangle  a fractal set of unstable periodic orbits .",
    "a fractal in phase space of such rapidly spinning systems was revealed in ref .",
    "@xcite for comparable mass black hole binaries in the post - newtonian expansion by numerically scattering black holes .",
    "an analysis centered on periodic orbits should reveal the fractal set more readily , thereby removing the need to search and survey phase space blindly for chaotic behavior .",
    "periodic orbits structure the entire equatorial dynamics around black holes . in the spirit of poincar s approach ,",
    "we have defined a taxonomy of all periodic orbits based on zooms , whirls , and vertices and forged an explicit connection with the set of rational numbers . under this scheme ,",
    "all generic aperiodic orbits can always be approximated as near one of the periodics .",
    "our method reveals that no eccentric orbits will trace out planetary type elliptical precessions in the strong - field regime . instead",
    ", all eccentric orbits are precessions of multi - leaf orbits with whirls multiplying as the black hole spins .",
    "the implication for gravitational wave astronomy is intriguing : all eccentric orbits will transition through these nearly periodic orbits as they inspiral to the plunge .    *",
    "acknowledgments *    we are especially grateful to becky grossman for her valuable and generous contributions to this work and to jamie rollins for his careful reading of the manuscript , inspired suggestions , and for coining our figures `` periodic tables '' .",
    "we also thank szabi marka for valuable discussions of this work .",
    "jl and gp - g acknowledge financial support from a columbia university ise grant .",
    "this material is based in part upon work supported under a national science foundation graduate research fellowship .",
    "we now present the explicit equations integrated to generate the results for  [ zoos ] and [ zook ] . we will also derive the association between periodic orbits and rational numbers from the dynamical systems perspective .",
    "since the natural language for that discussion is hamiltonian mechanics , we begin with the hamiltonian formulation of kerr geodesic motion .      in boyer - lindquist coordinates and geometrized units ( @xmath173 ) ,",
    "the kerr metric is @xmath174 here @xmath175 and @xmath176 denote the central black hole mass and spin angular momentum per unit mass , respectively . besides the test particle mass @xmath177 , three additional quantities are conserved along kerr geodesics : the energy @xmath2 and @xmath6-component of angular momentum @xmath3 as measured by observers at infinity , and the carter constant @xmath172 . following a useful and now common convention",
    ", we hereafter set both @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "this choice leaves the overall appearance of the metric and other kerr expressions otherwise unchanged provided all boyer - lindquist coordinates , the proper time @xmath180 , the spin parameter @xmath1 and all conserved quantities are now interpreted as dimensionless quantities .",
    "since they possess as many constants of motion ( @xmath181 ) as degrees of freedom ( @xmath182 ) , the usually second order geodesic equations can be integrated to yield a set of 4 first order equations of motion for the coordinates @xcite , @xmath183 where an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to the particle s proper time @xmath180 and @xmath184    we note that while these equations are concise and appealing in some ways , during numerical integration they tend to accumulate error at the turning points due to the explicit square roots in the @xmath71 and @xmath185 equations , not to mention the nuisance of having to change the signs of the @xmath71 and @xmath185 velocities by hand at every turning point .",
    "while other authors circumvent this problem with a rather involved reparametrization of the equations in ( [ dimcarter ] ) , we will see that in a hamiltonian formulation the numerical difficulties are avoided naturally .",
    "we begin with a lagrangian for a free particle in the kerr spacetime : @xmath186 because the @xmath187 are dimensionless coordinates ( @xmath188 ) , and because @xmath189 for timelike trajectories , eqn .",
    "( [ metric ] ) implies that @xmath190 is identically equal to @xmath191 along any trajectory . the particle s",
    "4-momentum @xmath192 is also dimensionless and is identical to the 4-velocity . defining the canonical momentum @xmath193 for the system in the standard way",
    ", we see that it coincides with the 4-momentum one - form , @xmath194 explicitly , the components of the momentum are @xmath195    we finally define the hamiltonian in the standard way , @xmath196 note that the hamiltonian is numerically identical to our lagrangian ( @xmath197 ) along any orbit because each quantity is just half the contraction of the 4-momentum .",
    "this is not surprising since , for geodesic motion , the lagrangian and hamiltonian contain only kinetic terms .    to get an explicit expression for the hamiltonian in terms of our dimensionless coordinates and momenta",
    ", we could compute the inverse metric @xmath198 and grind through eqn .",
    "( [ ham ] ) by brute force .",
    "however , a simple observation yields a nice expression for @xmath199 with much less effort . using eqns .",
    "( [ pr])-([ptheta ] ) in eqn .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) , we know the hamiltonian must have the form @xmath200 where @xmath201 is a function yet to be determined that depends only on @xmath202 and @xmath203 and , via the @xmath198 , on @xmath71 and @xmath185 . eliminating the @xmath204 and @xmath205 above with the use of ( [ momenta ] ) and ( [ dimcarter ] ) and noting that @xmath206 must identically equal @xmath191 , we see that @xmath207 this fixes @xmath201 and allows us finally to write @xmath206 as @xmath208 where @xmath209 and @xmath210 are the functions listed in eqns.([dimpots ] ) with every @xmath2 or @xmath3 therein interpreted as a @xmath211 or @xmath203 , respectively , and with every @xmath172 treated as a constant .    with the hamiltonian written as in ( [ niceham ] ) , hamilton s equations @xmath212 for the test particle motion become , explicitly , @xmath213 where the superscripts @xmath214 and @xmath185 denote differentiation with respect to @xmath71 and @xmath185 , respectively .",
    "note that since none of the equations contain square roots any more , they constitute a smoothly differentiable system of odes , even at turning points , and they can be integrated directly without resorting to an intricate change of variable .",
    "since the @xmath215 and @xmath216 equations vanish , the only added cost of retaining analytical transparency in the equations is that we must integrate 6 equations in ( [ eom ] ) instead of 4 in ( [ dimcarter ] ) .",
    "these are the quations we integrate numerically to identify the periodic orbits .",
    "we isolate the periodic orbits by inputing @xmath4 for a given @xmath1 and @xmath3 to locate the @xmath2 , apastron @xmath101 and perihelion @xmath102 of the corresponding periodic orbit .",
    "numerically the periodics are extracted by explicitly integrating @xmath217 to find those orbits for which the integral is a rational multiple of @xmath14 .    as a final check of our numerical results ,",
    "we run an independent code that computes the orbits directly from the geodesic equation and find the two independent computations in complete accord .",
    "in addition to deriving numerically supple equations of motion , we can use hamiltonian dynamics to relate the periodic orbits to rationally related canonical frequencies .",
    "we now relate those frequencies to the taxonomy we have developed .",
    "it is a classic result of hamiltonian dynamics that motion in a system with @xmath218 coordinates and @xmath218 conserved momenta will be confined to @xmath218-dimensional tori . in this case",
    "we do have 4 coordinates @xmath219 and 4 conserved quantitites @xmath220 .",
    "however , this classic result only applies to orbits bound in phase space . in our relativistic system , the @xmath221 direction throws a wrench in the works since every orbit increases without bound in the timelike direction ",
    "worldlines , in both phase space and configuration space , are not compact . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "we work in a formally _ reduced phase space_. any canonical coordinate can be chosen as the time parameter and its canonical momentum will become the hamiltonian for the reduced phase space @xcite . in our case , we choose to parameterize the orbits by @xmath221 and use @xmath222 as the hamiltonian of the reduced phase space .    in this paper",
    "we are only dealing with equatorial motion , for which motion lies in the 4d hypersurface defined by @xmath223 and on which @xmath224 . on that hypersurface @xmath225 and @xmath203",
    "still form a canonical set , so the hypersurface corresponding to equatorial orbits constitutes a _ bona fide _ 4d phase space .    on this space ,",
    "all phase space trajectories corresponding to orbits that are bound and non - plunging in configuration space lie on compact hypersurfaces topologically equivalent to 2d tori .",
    "thus , we can make the transformation to action - angle variables for those orbits , to which we now turn .",
    "a canonical transformation to action variables allows us to set each canonical momentum @xmath226 equal to a function of the constants of motion .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian can be rewritten as a function of the @xmath227 only , @xmath228 so that it is cyclic in all the @xmath229 , and the @xmath230 form a canonical set whose evolution is still determined by hamilton s equations @xmath231 ( @xmath232 ) . together , ( [ haa ] ) and ( [ eomaa ] ) imply that each @xmath226 is a constant of the motion and that each @xmath229 is linear in time , @xmath233 where each @xmath234 is a function only of the @xmath226 and thus also a constant of the motion .",
    "these constants are the orbital frequencies used as a basis in which to fourier decompose functions of generic kerr orbits , including the instantaneous adiabatic gravitational waveforms they emit .",
    "we define the radial and azimuthal actions in the standard way , as @xmath235 where the curves @xmath236 and @xmath237 are projections of the orbit into the @xmath238 and @xmath239 planes , respectively . because @xmath203 is",
    "a constant we see that @xmath240 we are more interested in the frequencies @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "an explicit expression for the hamiltonian in terms of the @xmath241 s requires inverting the @xmath242 integral in ( [ jdefs ] ) to solve for @xmath243 and thus is not analytically accessible .",
    "still , expressions for the @xmath244 in terms of @xmath245 rather than in terms of @xmath246 _ can _ be computed as follows .    since a trajectory",
    "can alternately be specified by constants of the motion @xmath247 or @xmath248 , there exists some transformation from the @xmath249 set to the @xmath246 set . since @xmath250 the jacobian of the transformation is @xmath251 which , since @xmath242 increases monotonically with @xmath2 at a given @xmath3 , never vanishes . there thus exists an inverse transformation @xmath252 from the actions back to the usual orbital constants",
    ". the product of those two transformations should be identity : @xmath253 which is equivalent to the two independent equations @xmath254 but in our reduced phase space , @xmath2 _ is _ the reduced hamiltonian , so each @xmath255 .",
    "the equations above then yield @xmath256 combining equations ( [ momenta ] ) , ( [ dimpots ] ) and ( [ jdefs ] ) , we see that @xmath257 and , combining this with the equations of motion , that @xmath258 where the term proportional to the partial of the limits vanishes since the integrand vanishes at the limits . continuing , @xmath259 where the last equality comes from equation ( [ dphir ] ) . additionally , @xmath260 where @xmath57 is the radial period of an orbit .",
    "the physical interpretation of the @xmath261 s is now clear .",
    "as expected , @xmath61 is @xmath262 where @xmath57 as measured in coordinate time @xmath221 . the rate at which azimuth accumulates averaged over the radial period is @xmath62 : @xmath263 because for a periodic orbit , the total orbital period is an integer multiple of @xmath57 ( in fact , @xmath264 ) , we can equivalently say that @xmath62 is the rate of increase of @xmath265 averaged over the entire orbital period ( this latter interpretation is what will generalize when we leave the equatorial plane ) . finally , to make the connection with the  [ find ] , note that the frequency ratio @xmath266 thus , in the action - angle picture , the periodic orbits are those with rationally related fundamental frequencies",
    ".    a typical orbit will fill out the torus because the canonical angular frequencies are not commensurate .",
    "in contrast , closed orbits do not .",
    "it is precisely this relation we have exploited to explicitly locate the periodic orbits in our taxonomy .",
    "as discussed briefly in  [ circs1 ] , circular orbits , while clearly periodic , are somewhat anomalous in the geometric picture and our @xmath5 scheme . after all , our taxonomy hinges on quantities calculated per radial period .",
    "since the radial period of a circular orbit is zero , it is not clear what rational number to associate with circular orbits .",
    "nevertheless , it turns our that in a useful and enlightening sense , some stable circular orbits ( a measure zero set of them , to be precise ) _ are _ mappable to the rational numbers .",
    "naively , we might expect them to correspond to the rational number 1 , just like keplerian circular orbits , but this turns out to be a mistake .",
    "the action - angle picture is significantly more informative here .",
    "our difficulty stems from the fact that all circular orbits have a vanishing radial action @xmath242 . in a loose sense ,",
    "the actions correspond to the two circumferences that characterize a two - dimensional torus .",
    "when one of those circumferences is zero , the 2-torus @xmath267 just becomes a 1-torus @xmath268 : a circle .",
    "orbits that are circular in configuration space thus live on surfaces in the phase space that also have the topology of circles . in that sense ,",
    "circular orbits only really have one fundamental frequency , @xmath62 , and there is no rational frequency ratio to speak of .",
    "they are all nonetheless periodic , for any value of @xmath62 , because any curve that fills out @xmath269 with a constant velocity necessarily closes on itself and becomes periodic .",
    "orbits not confined to the equatorial plane , which other authors usually refer to as `` non - equatorial circular orbits '' , this will no longer be the case .",
    "non - equatorial orbits in general have 3 associated actions @xmath270 and @xmath271 and are confined to surfaces with the topology of @xmath272 .",
    "on spherical orbits , @xmath242 vanishes , but the remaining actions do not , leaving spherical orbits to occupy surfaces with the topology of @xmath273 .",
    "much like generic equatorial orbits , then , spherical orbits will only be exactly periodic only when the ratio of their frequencies @xmath274 is rational . ]",
    "nonetheless some stable circular orbits can be mapped to the rational numbers .",
    "we can construct that map in two equivalent ways .",
    "first , for a given @xmath3 , we can take the zero eccentricity limit of the values of @xmath275 and their ratio and define the corresponding values for the circular orbit with that same @xmath3 to be those limits .",
    "this was the attitude taken in  [ circs1 ] .",
    "alternately , we can perform a linear stability analysis of the circular orbits .",
    "we find the frequencies of small oscillations of the @xmath71 and @xmath265 motions of low eccentricity orbits around the @xmath71 and @xmath265 motions of the reference circular orbits and examine the ratios of those frequencies .     versus the radii of stable circular orbits .",
    "right : @xmath61 versus the radii of stable circular orbits .",
    "increasing from right to left the spin values are @xmath276 .",
    "all orbits are prograde.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   versus the radii of stable circular orbits . right : @xmath61 versus the radii of stable circular orbits .",
    "increasing from right to left the spin values are @xmath276 .",
    "all orbits are prograde.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    whether derived from a stability analysis or as the limiting values of low eccentricity orbits , figure [ omegafig ] shows the resulting values of @xmath62 and @xmath61 while figure [ omegaphitor ] shows @xmath277 for stable circular orbits as a function of their radial coordinate @xmath71 for various values of @xmath1 .",
    "some features are worth noting .",
    "first , @xmath62 for a circular orbit is just the coordinate angular velocity and thus satisfies @xmath278 the well - known relativistic generalization of kepler s third law @xcite .",
    "second , the @xmath61 s differ from the keplerian in that the increase with decreasing @xmath71 until they hit some maximum ( in the keplerian case , the @xmath61 continue to increase and diverge at @xmath279 ) , at which point they decrease , reaching zero at the isco .",
    "the isco , then , will have a diverging @xmath277 ratio , an observation that was relevant in our discussion of homoclinic orbits .",
    "all homoclinic orbits have @xmath280 , including the isco is ( the eccentricity zero homoclinic orbit ) .",
    "third , @xmath277 for circular orbits is a continuous and monotonic function of @xmath71 , increasing from an asymptotic value of @xmath281 in the @xmath282 limit and diverging as @xmath283 .",
    "the continuity of this ratio means that although a measure zero subset of the circular orbits corresponds to rational numbers or , equivalently , to @xmath4 triplets , most do not .",
    "nevertheless , even the irrational circulars are arbitrarily close to some rational .",
    "we can thus characterize every circular orbit either exactly ( the rational circulars ) or approximately ( the irrational circulars ) by a @xmath284 triplet .",
    "finally , dissipative dynamical systems with multiple coupled frequencies , can sometimes attractors ( or at least transient attractors ) .",
    "those attractors typically correspond to rationals @xmath44 with low denominator fractional parts ( low @xmath6 ) .",
    "the @xmath286 and @xmath287 spin - orbit frequency ratios of the moon - earth and mercury - sun systems , respectively , are solar system examples of where this sort of behavior takes place .",
    "the possibility that an orbit decaying adiabatically under radiation reaction might become trapped in a resonance en route to plunge is thus open . at the time of submission of this article , we are still investigating that possibility ."
