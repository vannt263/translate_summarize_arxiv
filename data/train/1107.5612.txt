    "the case @xmath4 is called the kpi equation and can be employed to model water waves in thin films , where the very high surface tension dominates the gravitational force . more generally , equation is considered as one of the most generic models in nonlinear wave theory , modeling waves in acoustics , ferromagnetics and , more recently , in the bose - einstein condensation and in string theory .",
    "the kp equations are regarded as the natural extension of the celebrated korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation from one to two spatial dimensions ; in fact , they were first introduced in a 1970 paper by b. kadomtsev and v. petviashvili in order to study the stability of the soliton solutions of the kdv under the effect of transverse perturbations .",
