    "complex network theory has successfully accounted for structural and dynamical problems of complex systems in terms of their connectivity patterns  @xcite .",
    "most studies on complex networks , so far , have dealt with isolated network layers  @xcite . however , many real - world complex systems such as physical , social , biological , and infrastructural systems consist of multiple layers of networks interacting each other  @xcite . recently ,",
    "several studies on multiplex networks in which a node belongs to multiple network layers of distinct types of links  @xcite have contributed to the progress of research on multi - layer complex systems  @xcite along with other approaches like interdependent  @xcite and interconnected networks  @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that the coupling structure and the interactions among different layers can significantly affect percolation @xcite , diffusion  @xcite , cascade of failures  @xcite , and network evolution @xcite in such networks .",
    "for many real - world multiplex networks , network layers are correlated one another rather than combined randomly .",
    "although there exist various forms of correlations between network layers , the interlayer degree correlation would be one of the simplest types as observed in multiplex online game social network data  @xcite . in this case , a positive correlation represents that the degree of a node in one layer tends to be correlated with that in other layers , such that the hub in one layer also has many neighbors in the other layers . on the contrary",
    ", the hub in one layer would have few neighbors in the other layers for negatively correlated multiplex networks .",
    "recently , the effect of such interlayer degree correlation was addressed for connectivity of multiplex networks  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a few studies demonstrated that interdependent networks with higher interlayer degree correlation  @xcite or more assortative layers  @xcite are more robust under random damage .",
    "however , there is still lack of unified understanding of various robustness properties of multiplex networks due to the role of interlayer degree correlations .",
    "network robustness refers to the structural resilience of a network to external perturbations , which has been one of the most active topics in complex networks theory @xcite .",
    "the study on the network robustness aims not only for theoretical interests @xcite but also for practical applications to design more resilient structures against random breakdowns or intentional attacks @xcite .",
    "backup pathway between a pair of nodes is a meaningful concept of the network robustness , captured by the connection between a pair through at least two paths , termed biconnectivity  @xcite .",
    "since a biconnected pair in networks can communicate under removal of one route , the biconnectivity can play a significant role in the network robustness .",
    "another widely - used measure of the network robustness is the the size of remaining giant component after removing a fraction of nodes or links , either chosen randomly or targeted with respect to their degrees @xcite .",
    "previous studies found that the network robustness under removal of nodes ( or links ) depends on the connectivity patterns of networks  @xcite . in multiplex networks",
    ", different types of connectivity can be meaningful depending on the context with which the multiple network layers are coupled .",
    "in addition to the usual connectivity @xcite , for example , the so - called mutual connectivity can be significant in multiplex networks with cooperative or interdependent layers , in which case a node requires simultaneous connectivities through each and every layer for proper functioning  @xcite . here , we study the impact of the interlayer degree correlation on various robustness properties of multiplex networks in terms of the biconnectivity , the connectivity , and the mutual connectivity .        to take account of interlayer degree correlations",
    ", we mainly consider two layers of multiplex ( duplex ) networks with comparing three representative correlated structure ; maximally - positive ( mp ) , maximally - negative ( mn ) , and uncorrelated ( uc ) multiplex following ref .",
    "@xcite . in the mp case ,",
    "node s degrees in different layers are maximally correlated in their degree order , whereas they are maximally anti - correlated in the mn case .",
    "therefore , a node that is the hub in one layer is also the hub in the other layer for the mp case , but it has the smallest degree in the other layer for the mn case .",
    "real - world multiplex networks , of course , would be neither the mp nor the mn case , but the understanding based on these limiting structures with theoretical simplicity can be of illustrative and instructive for building insight towards more realistic situations .",
    "first , we examine the biconnectivity . subset of nodes in a network connected by at least two disjoint paths is said to form a biconnected component , or bicomponent for short @xcite .",
    "existence of the giant bicomponent spanning finite fraction of the entire system is important for stable connectivity of the network @xcite . by definition ,",
    "all nodes in a bicomponent have at least one alternative way preserving the connection in networks .",
    "if a typical time scale of the restoration of a broken node is much shorter than that of successive failures , every node in the bicomponent can completely endure its connectivity .      generalizing the generating function method from  @xcite to obtain the size of the giant bicomponent for multiplex networks with @xmath0 layers , we first define the generating function for the joint degree distribution of @xmath0 distinct types of links ( @xmath0 layers ) , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is used to designate the degrees of a node in each layer , as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is used to denote the auxiliary variables coupled to @xmath5 . we also define the generating function for the remaining degree distribution by following a randomly chosen @xmath6-type link , given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mean degree of layer @xmath6 . then",
    ", on locally tree - like networks , the probability @xmath9 that a node reached upon following an @xmath6-type edge does not belong to the giant component is given by the coupled self - consistency equations @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "the size of the giant bicomponent , @xmath12 , is equal to the complementary probability that a randomly chosen node has none or one of its links leading to a node in the giant component @xcite , therefore , @xmath13 where the first two terms give the size of the giant unicomponent , @xmath14 @xcite , and the last term gives the difference between @xmath15 and @xmath12 .",

    "the main results from comparisons of the three correlation types are as follows .",
    "first , the more correlated - coupling there is in multiplex networks , the lower does the percolation threshold become . furthermore , the size of the giant bicomponent for the mp case , @xmath20 , is the same as that of the giant unicomponent , @xmath21 ( figs .",
    "2a , b ) , meaning that all pairs of nodes in the giant unicomponent have at least two independently connected paths .",
    "in addition , the giant bicomponent always exists for any non - zero link density , so that the mp coupling offers a well - connected structure even with sparse link density .    on the contrary ,",
    "the emergence of the giant bicomponent for the mn coupling is much delayed . after passing the percolation threshold , @xmath40 , the size of the bicomponent @xmath41 increases slower than @xmath42 ( fig .",

    "therefore @xmath46 increases from zero in a convex manner near @xmath47 , in contrast to the behavior of @xmath15 displaying a concave increase above @xmath47 with @xmath48 for all three cases @xcite . when @xmath49 , the entire network is connected into a single component for the mn coupling and the disparity between @xmath41 and @xmath42 disappears , too .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath50 for the mn coupling is located at @xmath51 , which is larger than that for the uc coupling @xmath52 .",
    "the mn coupling hinders the emergence of the giant bicomponent for low density , yet it can establish the biconnected structure over the whole network with a finite link density .",
    "the error and attack tolerance of a network under structural disturbance has been one of the major problems in network theory  @xcite , which has also been addressed in the context of interdependent networks @xcite in recent years . in this section",

    "to take a more comprehensive overview of the effect of various multiplex coupling factors , we consider additional layer coupling scenarios : i ) duplex er networks of layers with different mean degrees , ii ) duplex er networks with non - maximal correlated couplings , and iii ) triplex er networks .",

    "5a ) and the attack ( fig .",
    "the results are qualitatively the same as the equal mean degree case with the same total mean degree : for random failure , the mp coupling is most robust and the mn coupling is least robust ( fig .  5a , to be compared with fig .",

    "4c ) . for @xmath81 ,",
    "the mp case becomes more vulnerable than the uc case against the attack when the total mean degree exceeds @xmath83 , which is less than that for the identical mean degree case , suggesting that the layer degree disparity can shrink the regime where the mp coupling is most robust to the attack .",
    "second , the duplex er networks with non - maximal correlated coupling are considered .",
    "we construct a non - maximal correlated coupling in the following way @xcite .",
    "a fraction @xmath84 of nodes are maximally correlated - coupled ( either mp or mn ) while the other @xmath85 fraction is randomly coupled ( uc ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath84 sets the strength of correlated coupling between multiplex layers . in this scheme ,",
    "the joint degree distribution of the duplex network is obtained by @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is either mp or mn , which can be readily adopted for theoretical calculation .",
    "the results for @xmath88 show that the non - maximal correlation can still affect the robustness of networks but the magnitude of the effect is smaller than that of the maximally correlated couplings ( fig .",
    "5c , d ; to be compared with fig .",
    "3d , 4c , respectively ) .",
    "finally , we briefly address the robustness of the correlated triplex er networks with equal layer - densities . as there can be two independent interlayer couplings for triplex networks ,",
    "there exist a total of six different combinations of layer couplings . here",
    "we show the results for three representative coupling combinations : mp - mp , uc - uc , and mn - mp couplings .",
    "for example , the mn - mp coupling may represent the case where the first layer is coupled with the second layer by the mn coupling whereas it is coupled with the third layer by the mp coupling .",
    "we found that among these three cases the mp - mp coupling is most robust to random node failure but can be fragile to targeted attack , whereas the mn - mp coupling exhibits the opposite behaviors ( fig .",
    "the mn - mn coupling gives same results with the mn - mp coupling in this case .",
    "we also observed that the mp - uc ( mn - uc ) coupling yields intermediate behaviors between mp - mp ( mn - mp ) and uc - uc couplings : @xmath74 as well as @xmath68 for mp - uc ( mn - uc ) lies between those of mp - mp ( mn - mp ) and uc - uc couplings .",
    "we also study the same problem for multiplex scale - free ( sf ) networks numerically . to build the sf network layers with tunable degree exponent @xmath89 and mean degree",
    ", we use the static model  @xcite , where each node @xmath90 @xmath91 has an endogenous weight @xmath92 given by @xmath93 , with @xmath94 being a constant , @xmath95 . for each step to construct a network , a pair of nodes , say @xmath90 and @xmath96 , are chosen independently following the probability @xmath92 and @xmath97 , respectively , and connected unless they are already linked .",
    "one repeats this step until the layer has the desired mean degree @xmath19 . for typical cases with @xmath98 ,",
    "the degree distribution of the resulting layer is asymptotically scale - free , decaying as @xmath99 with the degree exponent @xmath100 .     to the random failure for @xmath78 (",
    "a ) and the intentional attack based on the total degree for @xmath78 and @xmath101 ( b ) , obtained with @xmath23 nodes , averaged over @xmath24 runs . ]",
    "we use sf layers with identical degree exponent @xmath102 , which is in the range @xmath103 . in this regime , each layer itself is extremely resilient against the random failures due to high degree heterogeneity , as is well - known from the single - network studies @xcite .",
    "therefore , all three coupling types show high robustness , with only a small difference among them that the mp coupling is most robust and the mn coupling is least robust , similarly with duplex er cases ( fig .",
    "6a ) . for the attack ,",
    "the mn case is more resilient for dense networks but more vulnerable for sparse networks , again in qualitative similarity to duplex er cases , as illustrated by the comparisons of duplex sf networks of equal mean degrees @xmath78 and @xmath101 , respectively  ( fig .",

    "@xcite , as follows . on locally tree - like networks ,",
    "the probability that a node reached by following an @xmath6-type link does not belong to the giant mutual component , @xmath104 , is given by the following coupled self - consistency equations , @xmath105 then the size of the giant mutual component , @xmath106 , for multiplex networks is obtained by @xmath107     ( b ) , and on the correlated triplex er networks ( c ) .",
    "lines represent analytical calculations and the symbols in ( a ) are numerical results obtained with @xmath23 nodes , averaged over @xmath24 runs . ]    the main results of analytic predictions from the above theory as well as the numerical simulations for the duplex er networks are as follows ( fig .",
    "as is well - known  @xcite , the giant mutual component emerges discontinuously , in contrast with the ordinary percolation transition that exhibits a continuous phase transition .",
    "similarly to the ordinary connectivity @xcite , the percolation threshold of the mutual percolation for the mp coupling is lower , whereas the mn coupling requires denser network for the emergence of the giant mutual component than the other cases .",
    "we performed additional analyses on multiplex er networks , shown in fig .  7 , for the cases of non - maximal correlated couplings ( fig .",
    "7a ) , unequal layer - densities ( fig .",
    "7b ) , and triplex layers ( fig .",

    "combining the theory for the mutual percolation and the node removals @xcite ( see also @xcite for an alternative approach ) , the probability @xmath110 that a node reached by following an @xmath6-type link does not belong to the giant mutual component after deletion of nodes can be obtained by the following coupled self - consistency equations @xmath111 ( 1-y_i^{k_i-1})\\prod_{j=1,j\\ne i}^{n } ( 1-y_j^{k_j}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the size of the giant mutual component @xmath106 after node removals can be computed as @xmath112 \\prod_{j=1}^{n } ( 1-y_j^{k_j}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the duplex er networks with equal layer - densities , we found that the mp ( mn ) coupling is more robust ( vulnerable ) than the other cases against the random node removals . the result for the mp case",
    "was also obtained earlier in refs .",
    "the rescaled size of the giant mutual component , @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the size of the giant mutual component with @xmath70 , for the mp ( mn ) coupling is larger ( smaller ) than those for the others for any removal fraction @xmath54 ( fig .",
    "8a ) . for the targeted attack based on the total degree ,",
    "however , the effect of correlated multiplexity is more complicated . for sufficiently low density , e.g. , @xmath115 ( fig .",
    "8b ) , the mp ( mn ) coupling is more robust ( vulnerable ) than the others against the attack . with intermediate density ,",

    "8d ) , the mn ( mp ) case is most robust ( vulnerable ) against the attack , opposite to the low density case .",
    "this shows that the effect of correlated multiplexity on the robustness of mutual connectivity is not monotonic and could depend strongly on the details of interdependency .",
    "finally , we examine the robustness property of a real - world multiplex network under node removals .",
    "the real - world network data we consider consists of two layers , the internet backbone network and the high - voltage electrical transmission network in italy  @xcite .",
    "these two network layers can be regarded as interdependent in such a way that a failure in one layer ( say , a power station in the power grid ) would lead to that on the other layer ( say , a power control station communicating through the internet ) , and vice versa . thus this system can be modeled as a multiplex network . following the rationale of @xcite",
    ", we have established the interdependency between two layers based on the geographical distance so that each node in the internet network is interdependent on the closest node in the power transmission network .",
    "nodes with no interdependent partner are thought to be functional autonomously .        we first calculate numerically the fraction of functional interdependent nodes , @xmath118 , of the internet - power transmission multiplex network following the interdependent cascade model of ref .",
    "@xcite upon the random failure and the degree - based targeted attack on the interdependent nodes ( fig .",
    "the numerical results show that the rescaled fraction of functional nodes , @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the fraction of functional nodes with @xmath70 , is relatively robust against the random failure as it can endure up to around 80% interdependent - node removals , whereas it rapidly disintegrates upon the targeted attack on as small as 20% of highest - degree interdependent nodes .",
    "we also examine the effect of correlated couplings in this system to the attack vulnerability by using artificial multiplex networks with rewired interdependency into the mp or the mn types ( fig .",
    "the results for the rewired multiplex networks show that the mn coupling is more robust to the targeted attack on high - degree nodes than the mp coupling .",
    "it is interesting to note that the behavior of the real - world network data lies close to that of the mn coupling despite significant difference in actual interdependency patterns .",
    "in this paper , we have studied various network robustness properties of multiplex networks focusing on the role of the correlation between degrees of a node across different layers .",
    "we have analyzed specifically the biconnectivity and the error and attack tolerance of the ordinary as well as the mutual connectivity , covering a wide spectrum of network robustness relevant to multiplex networks .",
    "we found that the correlated coupling of multiplex layers can significantly alter the robustness properties of multiplex networks in diverse ways .",
    "for example , positively - correlated multiplex networks are more robust , whereas anti - correlated multiplex are less robust , in the context of the biconnectivity and the ordinary as well as mutual connectivity upon random node failure . to the targeted attack based on nodes degrees , on the contrary ,",
    "positively - correlated multiplex networks with sufficiently high link - density can be highly vulnerable , whereas the anti - correlated ones can become more resilient .",
    "we also examined the effect of various additional multiplex - coupling factors and a real - world example of the italian internet - power transmission multiplex system .",
    "our analyses reveal that the notion of network robustness can exhibit more diversified aspects in multiplex networks compared to single - network situation , dependent on specific context and interplay between the network layers .",
    "we expect our initial analyses could prompt attention and provide a basic insight for further research endeavors on understanding the robustness of correlated multiplex systems .",
    "interesting topics of future work in this regard would include the extension to account for higer - order correlation properties beyond the interlayer degree correlation considered in this work , such as clustering  @xcite in multiplex networks .",

    "<S> we study the robustness properties of multiplex networks consisting of multiple layers of distinct types of links , focusing on the role of correlations between degrees of a node in different layers . </S>",
    "<S> we use generating function formalism to address various notions of the network robustness relevant to multiplex networks such as the resilience of ordinary- and mutual connectivity under random or targeted node removals as well as the biconnectivity . </S>",
    "<S> we found that correlated coupling can affect the structural robustness of multiplex networks in diverse fashion . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for maximally - correlated duplex networks , all pairs of nodes in the giant component are connected via at least two independent paths and network structure is highly resilient to random failure . in contrast , anti - correlated duplex networks are on one hand robust against targeted attack on high - degree nodes , but on the other hand they can be vulnerable to random failure . </S>"
