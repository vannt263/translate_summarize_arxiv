    "here we briefly discuss the vertex corrections in the @xmath23 multiband situation considered here .      1 .   _ no on - site optical ( dipole - allowed ) transitions _ : the optical absorption process requires moving an electron from one site to another .",
    "this is trivially satisfied in the single - band model , but is also satisfied in multiband models of the type we consider where the interacting on - site orbitals are @xmath101-derived and all have the same even parity . if one were to consider a more general model that included say the ru @xmath135 or @xmath136 orbitals , _ and _ were to include interactions linking the @xmath137 and @xmath138 orbitals , then vertex corrections would be non - vanishing .",
    "point parity symmetry_. the issue here is that if condition ( 1 ) is satisfied , the dipole required for the optical transition is made by moving an electron from one site to another .",
    "if moving the electron to the left or to the right creates equal magnitude dipoles with opposite signs , no on - site effect can be generated and vertex corrections do not arise .    mathematically a vertex correction arises from @xmath139 ; if the conditions above are satisfied then @xmath38 ( which in single - site dmft is site - local ) is a scalar and there is no vector in the problem which can allow @xmath140 to couple to it to first order .",
    "specifically , in the formalism used in our paper the green s function is a @xmath141 matrix . in the wannier basis that we use , ( @xmath23-derived states localized on the 4 ru atoms in the unit cell ) the self - energy is independent of momentum in the brillouin zone and is site - diagonal , so that the self - energy matrix is block ( site ) -diagonal in this basis . the bare conductivity operator has no matrix elements between states on the same site ( within the same block ) : conductivity processes only transfer an electron from one site to another , via a matrix element which has odd parity . in these circumstances ,",
    "the vertex correction for the optical conductivity indeed vanishes in the single - site approximation .    in a crystal structure of sufficiently low symmetry ,",
    "hybridization effects could in principle lower the point symmetry of a given ru site , so that the on - site wave functions did not have pure @xmath101 character ( referred to the ru site ) , thereby creating a vector in the problem that would allow a non - zero @xmath139 ; this would also activate an on - site optical transition , thereby requiring a vertex correction .",
    "however , we know that such effects are very small in the case we consider ( to a very good approximation the four ru in a unit cell are related by a translation and octahedral rotation and the octahedra are close to symmetric ) , and have been set to zero by the approximation we are forced to make to set the off - diagonal terms in the hybridization function to zero .",
    "we further observe that additional small interband terms would only act to increase the differences between the actual conductivity and the allen formula , strenghtening our conclusion that one can not safely draw inferences about non - fermi - liquid behavior or quasiparticle scattering rates from optical conductivities once the structure becomes non - cubic .",

    "<S> the typical procedure is to express the complex conductivity @xmath82 in terms of an optical mass enhancement @xmath83 and scattering rate @xmath84 defined as @xmath85 the objects @xmath83 and @xmath84 are often interpreted as mass enhancement and scattering rate , respectively , and are assumed to provide information about the electron self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> their frequency dependence is determined by the frequency dependence of the complex conductivity while the overall magnitude is determined by the constant @xmath86 . in the two panels of fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the scattering rate magnitude is correctly estimated and the low frequency @xmath4 behavior is clear . the low frequency limit of the mass corresponds precisely to the quasiparticle mass enhancement and the decrease of mass at higher frequency reflects the flattening of the @xmath90 curve @xcite .    for calculations performed with the experimental structure </S>",
    "<S> the situation is different : at low frequencies the inferred scattering rate is too large by a factor @xmath91 and has the wrong concavity . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the inferred scattering rate is roughly consistent with an @xmath92 behavior and , similarly , over a limited low frequency range the optical mass can be fit as @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that caution is warranted in performing a memory function analysis of the low frequency data on gdfeo@xmath0-distorted materials . </S>",
    "<S> however , the reasonable correspondence at higher frequencies ( @xmath94  mev ) between the optical scattering rate and the imaginary part of the self - energy ( averaged over positive and negative frequencies ) again confirms that in this range the conductivity does give a reasonable estimate of the magnitude and the saturation frequency of the self - energy , and in this sense reveals non - fermi - liquid behavior of the hund s metal kind .    in summary , using caruo@xmath0 as an example we have shown that real materials effects , in particular a multiplicity of optically allowed low - lying transitions arising from band folding due to rotational and tilt distortions , can produce a low frequency conductivity of the form previously associated with non - fermi - liquid physics . a direct diagnosis of universal fermi - liquid behavior from the optical conductivity , along the lines of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , only applies when such effects are not important . </S>",
    "<S> our results call for a reexamination of other reports of unusual optical response , for instance in srruo@xmath0 , which has a ferromagnetic ground state and a smaller orthorhombic distortion , and for which arpes spectra consistent with fermi - liquid behavior are observed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to examine whether low - lying interband transitions complicate the analysis @xcite of the ratio of the @xmath5 and @xmath4 terms in the optical scattering rate , which has been argued to be inconsistent with fermi - liquid theory .    </S>",
