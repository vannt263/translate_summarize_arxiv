    "the milky way radiation has been mapped extensively at different wavelengths for many decades .",
    "photon emission at low and ultra - high energy is still currently studied .",
    "all the latest observations appear extremely exciting and shed new light on the physics of the galactic centre . among them , there is the observation of a 511 kev emission line by spi , a spectrometer on board of the integral satellite launched in 2002 .",
    "the 511  kev line has been detected by many experiments since the seventies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but the origin of the line could not be established unambiguously . with the new results from spi @xcite , one could determine that it is due to ( para-)positronium formation , thus confirming the presence of anti matter in our galaxy .",
    "a very striking feature of this line is that it is mostly emitted in the bulge of the milky way ( the distribution is well approximated by a sphere ; the full width at half maximum is about @xmath2 of diameter ) .",
    "no significant emission was detected in the disk .",
    "this characteristic tends to exclude astrophysical sources such as hypernovae / wolf  rayet stars , pulsars , and cosmic ray interactions . on the other hand , this observation could point towards an old galactic population @xcite .",
    "a blind source analysis showed that more than 8 point sources could explain the emission @xcite .",
    "a diffuse source provides a very good fit too .",
    "none of these sources has been found as yet .",
    "this makes the origin of the galactic positrons even more mysterious .",
    "low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) could perhaps be an explanation if the positrons emitted in the disk escape into the bulge .",
    "their characteristics are poorly known though ( e.g. flux , jet content ) .",
    "no 511 kev emission has been seen so far from the brightest of these objects , but more observations will be dedicated to this kind of candidates .",
    "type 1a supernovae ( sn1a ) may also explain the line emission if the positron escape fraction and the supernovae explosion rate are large enough to maintain a steady flux .",
    "at present various observations contradict with each other and it is quite difficult to know whether these two conditions are indeed satisfied in our galaxy . ray background may have been overestimated @xcite . ] dedicated observations of sn1a remnants are also scheduled with integral and should help answering these questions @xcite .",
    "another possible source of low energy positrons could be dark matter annihilations @xcite .",
    "this scenario requires a dark matter mass between a few mev and a few hundred mev , two kinds of interactions , and a cuspy dark matter halo profile ( likely to be as cuspy as a navarro  frenk  white model @xcite ) .",
    "this dark matter profile corresponds to theoretical predictions from numerical simulations , but it has not been confirmed as yet observationally @xcite .    light dark matter ( ldm ) particles were initially proposed in the context of the so - called cold dark matter crisis .",
    "these particles were meant to experience a new damping effect , including one that is half - way between the collisional damping and the free - streaming .",
    "they were meant to inherit from the damping of relativistic species ( @xmath3 ) with which they weakly interact either directly or indirectly @xcite . in the indirect case ,",
    "the damping of the species @xmath4 is communicated to dark matter through the dark matter coupling to other particles in contact with @xmath4 .",
    "for example , before recombination , dark matter indirectly experiences the silk damping , until it thermally decouples from electrons .",
    "this new effect ( called induced damping ) is simply the generalization of the silk damping effect to dark matter and has been confirmed numerically @xcite . in the direct case , ldm may suffer from the mixed damping effect @xcite , which corresponds to the situation where , due to a weak but large enough neutrino  dm interaction rate , dark matter inherits from the neutrino free - streaming .",
    "this occurs when ldm stays coupled to neutrinos after their thermal decoupling .",
    "for some specific values of the dm@xmath5 elastic scattering cross section , these interactions affect the dm fluid but do not change the neutrino fluid properties .",
    "this effect was stressed in refs .",
    "@xcite for neutralinos when they are strongly mass degenerated with sneutrinos and for mev particles having weak interactions @xcite .",
    "light dark matter particles therefore have this interesting property : on the one hand , they look like cold dark matter candidates because of their mass and weak interactions . on the other hand ,",
    "their linear matter power spectrum is cut  off at a cosmological scale ( due to these new damping effects ) , which is a well - known characteristic of warm dark matter candidates .    to avoid an overproduction of gamma  rays and satisfy simultaneously the relic density criterion , the ldm total annihilation cross section at early times should be larger than that in the primordial universe or in virialized objects @xcite .",
    "this leads to a scenario in which the ldm interactions , and hence the damping , are suppressed @xcite ( the damping mass in the linear matter power spectrum was estimated to be about @xmath6 ) .",
    "following up ref .",
    "@xcite , there have been many other dark matter models proposed to explain the 511 kev emission , e.g. refs .  .",
    "here we focus on the annihilating case . in this scenario",
    ", there is a light extra gauge boson @xmath7 ( needed for the relic density ) and heavy charged particles ( for the 511 kev emission ) @xcite .",
    "this new set of particles is quite similar to that expected in @xmath8 supersymmetry .",
    "the model is described in detail in ref .",
    "the constraints on the couplings are given in ref .",
    "we disregard the possibility that dark matter is fermionic , particles before a careful treatment of the positron propagation has been performed .",
    "nevertheless , with a profile at least as cuspy as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the emission is naturally confined in the bulge , so the propagation can be neglected and the conclusion should remain the same . ] following up ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "heavy dark matter particles , i.e. @xmath9 mev , are in danger of yielding a too large contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron @xcite .",
    "also they would make the observed fraction of para and ortho - positronium very hard to explain @xcite and would eventually yield a too large @xmath10 inflight annihilation contribution @xcite .",
    "any other way of reducing the mass range which is not too model dependent and which could be related to the 511 kev flux is very interesting . in that context , the beacom et al .",
    "proposal @xcite , to constrain the dark matter mass from the comparison between observations and the gamma  ray flux originating from the bremsstrahlung , looks promising even if it gives a smaller contribution than the inflight annihilations .",
    "this suggestion is complementary to a previous estimate made before integral s publication @xcite . in that work",
    ", it was assumed that each electron and positron produced by dark matter annihilations spontaneously generates one photon after their emission .",
    "the authors assumed that the total annihilation cross section was either velocity - dependent or velocity - independent .",
    "after comparison with the gamma  ray observations ( and requiring the correct relic density ) , they concluded that only a velocity - dependent cross section was possible for @xmath11 mev while for greater masses either a velocity - dependent or independent cross section could be allowed .",
    "however , the model that fits integral / spi data requires two kinds of interactions simultaneously .",
    "one is velocity - dependent and is needed for fitting the relic density .",
    "the other one is velocity - independent and is quite mandatory for fitting the 511 kev emission morphology .",
    "such a scheme is not compatible with ref .",
    "@xcite in which it was assumed that only one process ( either velocity dependent or independent ) was contributing to the total annihilation cross section .",
    "one therefore has to estimate the gamma ray production again and derive the corresponding upper bound on the dark matter mass , assuming that ldm is at the origin of all the 511 kev emission mapped by spi .    by doing so the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that @xmath12 could not exceed 20 mev .",
    "their estimate of @xmath13 is based on an old observation made by berends et al .",
    "@xcite according to which , in qed or @xmath14 gauge theories , the cross sections associated with the single emission of a hard bremsstrahlung photon becomes remarkably simple in the ultrarelativistic limit .",
    "using specific examples , berends et al . showed that a factorization into two terms can be observed .",
    "one factor is the squared amplitude associated with the 2-to-2 process ( i.e. without the additional emission of the photon ) , and evaluated for a generalized kinematics .",
    "the second factor is related to the infrared factor , which describes the soft photon limit .",
    "such a property shows up for example in @xmath1 .",
    "the expressions for the initial and final - state radiation cross sections associated with this process can be found for example in the review of berends and bhm @xcite .",
    "beacom et al . thus argued that the final - state radiation cross section of dark matter particles annihilating while they are almost at rest can be written as the product of the two - to - two process times an universal factor . in a next step they assumed that this factor can be obtained from the known results for the final - state radiation associated with the @xmath15 process in the ultrarelativistic limit , where the electron mass is neglected",
    "however , in the case of dark matter , the ultrarelativistic limit is not appropriate .",
    "furthermore for chiral dark matter couplings it is also obvious that the electron mass can not be neglected .",
    "also @xmath16 and @xmath17 are intrinsically different .",
    "@xmath18 is due to a photon exchange in the @xmath19-channel ; it involves only vectorial couplings .",
    "in contrast , @xmath20 proceeds through a @xmath0-channel exchange of a heavy fermion and can involve chirality flipping couplings . thus writing the bremsstrahlung cross section as the product of two factors",
    "may not be correct .",
    "here we demonstrate that the approach followed in ref .",
    "@xcite fails to correctly describe the bremsstrahlung process in the hard photon limit .",
    "]    in what follows we study the process @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes a spin-0 dark matter particle .",
    "since dark matter is neutral , the emission of a photon necessarily comes from the final state particles and the particle that is exchanged during the annihilation process ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feynmandiagrams ] .",
    "it is convenient to use the scaled energies as independent variables : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 . due to energy momentum conservation , @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "are not independent of each other : @xmath29 in terms of @xmath30 and @xmath28 , the scalar products between final state momenta read : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the electron mass . in the case of dark matter",
    "it is legitimate to assume that it is almost at rest when it annihilates . at earth position ,",
    "the dark matter velocity dispersion is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the speed of light ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "it is even smaller below 1 kpc ( say , inside the galactic centre ) .",
    "thus any scalar product that involves the four - momenta of both initial and final state particles can be expressed in a very simple way , without involving any undefined angles .",
    "in particular we obtain : @xmath35      for later use",
    "we reproduce here the annihilation cross section associated with the process @xmath36 at tree  level @xcite . neglecting the p - wave annihilation cross section because of the suppression of the dark matter velocity in the 511 kev region , we find that the corresponding cross section @xmath37 is given by : @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath12 denotes the mass of the annihilating scalar and @xmath41 the mass of the heavy charged fermion that is exchanged in the @xmath0-channel . from inspection of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma0 ] ) , one can easily see that in general it is not appropriate to neglect the electron mass .",
    "if the ratio between the chiral couplings @xmath42 is of the order of @xmath43 then the term that is formally suppressed through the electron mass has the same importance as the term in @xmath44 . such a scenario arises naturally in 2-higgs doublet models with flavour changing neutral couplings .",
    "i.e. the lagrangian @xmath45 leads immediately to @xmath46 if we identify @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "such a case does not fit spi data unless one considers extremely large couplings of a few units .",
    "since the particle @xmath23 is charged , the mass @xmath41 must be larger than 100 gev , given lep limits @xcite restricting the range of the couplings that can be considered .",
    "in the limit where @xmath12 and @xmath49 , the cross section becomes : @xmath50 with @xmath51 keeping only the leading term in the @xmath52 expansion , we obtain for @xmath37 @xmath53    to compute the annihilation rate and therefore the flux of positrons and/or photons that are emitted during the dark matter annihilations , one must consider @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the dark matter relative velocity ) instead of @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath55 is twice the dark matter velocity in the centre - of - mass frame ( written here as @xmath56 ) .",

    "<S> we compare our result with the work of beacom et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unlike what is stated in the literature , we show that the bremsstrahlung cross section is not necessarily given by the tree - level annihilation cross section ( for a generalized kinematics ) times a factor related to the emission of a soft photon . </S>",
    "<S> such a factorization appears only in the soft photon limit or in the approximation where the masses of the particles in the initial and final states are negligible with respect to the mass of the internal particle . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the latter case , we do not recover the same factor as for @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> numerically the difference , in the hard photon limit , is as large as a factor 3.6 . however </S>",
    "<S> the effect on the upper limit of the dark matter mass is not significant . using gamma ray observations </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an upper limit on the dark matter mass of 30 or 100 mev ( depending on the region that is considered for the 511 kev analysis ) while beacom et al . found 20 mev . </S>"
