    "we believe that this is the case at points @xmath4 such that @xmath80 , so that in the end the entire @xmath5-multifractal spectrum of @xmath6 would be @xmath81 for all @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "another remark is that for a given @xmath13 , there is an optimal @xmath83 such that @xmath6 belongs locally to @xmath84 , so that the @xmath10-exponents ( instead of the 2-exponents ) may carry some interesting information about the local behavior of @xmath6 .",
    "in all the proofs , @xmath17 will denote a constant that does not depend on the variables involved in the equations .",
    "for two real numbers @xmath85 , the notation @xmath86 means that @xmath87 for some constant @xmath88 independent of the variables in the problem .    in section 2 of @xcite ( also in @xcite ) ,",
    "the key point to study the local behavior of the fourier series @xmath6 was to obtain an explicit formula for @xmath89 in the range @xmath90 ; this formula was just a twisted version of the one known for the jacobi theta function . in our range @xmath57 ,",
    "such a formula can not exist because of the convergence problems , but we will get some truncated versions of it in order to prove theorems [ convergence ] and [ smoothness ] .",
