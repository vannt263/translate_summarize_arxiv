    "<S> we present a fluid dynamics video showing how capillary rafts sink . </S>",
    "<S> small objects trapped at an interface are very common in nature ( insects walking on water , ant rafts , bubbles or pollen at the water - air interface , membranes ... ) and are found in many multiphase industrial processes . thanks to archimedes principle we can easily predict whether an object sinks or floats . but what happens when several small particles are placed at an interface between two fluids . in this case surface tension also plays an important role . </S>",
    "<S> these particles self - assemble by capillarity and thus form what we call a `` capillary raft '' . </S>",
    "<S> we show how such capillary rafts sink for varying sizes of particles and define how this parameter affects the sinking process . </S>"
