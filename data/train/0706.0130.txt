    "the recently observed most massive neutron star with @xmath0 excludes exotic phases of high density matter and requires a relatively stiff eos .",
    "contrary to a naive expectation , the astrophysical observations do , however , not stand in contradiction with those from heavy ion reactions .",
    "moreover , we are in the fortunate situation that ab initio calculations of the nuclear many - body problem predict a density and isospin behavior of the eos which is in agreement with both observations .",
    "in _ ab initio _ calculations based on many - body techniques one derives the eos from first principles , i.e. treating short - range and many - body correlations explicitly .",
    "this allows to make prediction for the high density behavior , at least in a range where hadrons are still the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "a typical example for a successful many - body approach is brueckner theory ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . in the following we consider non - relativistic brueckner and variational calculations @xcite as well as relativistic brueckner calculations @xcite .",

    "these limits come from a population synthesis of young , nearby nss  @xcite and masses of ns binaries  @xcite .",
    "while the present dbhf eos leads to too fast neutrino cooling this behavior can be avoided if a phase transition to quark matter is assumed @xcite .",
