    "note that unlike the underlying convex bodies in ( 1)-(3 ) , this body is neither smooth nor a polytope .",
    "the software matlab and qhull were used to carry out the following simulations and computations .",
    "one realization of the @xmath2-vector is computed by first fixing the dimension @xmath22 , generating @xmath0 i.i.d .",
    "points @xmath53 from one of the fixed probability distributions described above , taking the convex hull of these points to construct a random polytope @xmath5 , and computing the @xmath2-vector of the random polytope . assuming the random polytope is _ simplicial _ ,",
    "that is , each of its facets has exactly @xmath22 vertices , the @xmath2-vector of the polytope can be directly computed from the facets .",

    "since @xmath61 is the number of @xmath62-dimensional faces of @xmath5 , @xmath61 is found by counting all intersections of size @xmath11 between pairs of facets @xmath63 and @xmath64 , for @xmath65 . since",
    "each @xmath62-dimensional face is the intersection of exactly two facets , this accounts for all @xmath62-dimensional faces .",
    "for example , 3-dimensional faces @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where each @xmath68 is a vertex for that face , have intersection @xmath69 which is of size 2 so it must be an edge , but @xmath66 and @xmath70 have intersection @xmath71 which is of size 1 so it is not an edge .",
    "let @xmath72 be these distinct intersections of size @xmath62 ; clearly @xmath73 . by keeping track of all the intersections of size @xmath11",
    ", we obtain a list of all @xmath62-dimensional faces of @xmath5 .",
    "we can then repeat this process with those faces . continuing inductively in this manner ,",
    "the remaining components of @xmath2 can be determined .",
    "note that the convex hull of points in general can be non - simplicial ( a facet may have more than @xmath22 vertices ) , and so the above algorithm for constructing the @xmath2-vector from the facets is not valid for all polytopes .",
    "however , the probability of a non - simplicial convex hull arising from the distributions of points considered in this paper is 0 .",
    "a collection of @xmath23 realizations of @xmath2-vectors was obtained , and the data were then standardized and compared to the standard gaussian distribution .",
    "the following demonstrates the computations of standardizing the @xmath2-vectors .",
    "let @xmath74 be the @xmath75 @xmath2-vector ; then @xmath76 is the @xmath77 component of the @xmath75 @xmath2-vector .",
    "define the sample mean @xmath78  of the _ f_-vectors as @xmath79 where @xmath80 . given the sample data @xmath81 ,",
    "the sample covariance matrix @xmath82_{i , j=1}^d$ ] is a @xmath22-by-@xmath22 matrix with entries given by @xmath83 . to standardize to identity sample covariance ,",
    "first diagonalize the sample covariance @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues and @xmath86 is an orthogonal matrix where the columns of @xmath86 are the eigenvectors .",
    "moreover , the eigenvalues of @xmath85 can be assumed to be in decreasing order , @xmath87 .",
    "note that the components of the @xmath2-vectors have some dependence on each other . for polygons ,",
    "the components of the @xmath2-vector obey @xmath88 .",
    "for convex polyhedra in @xmath26 , the components of the @xmath2-vector satisfy @xmath89 , known as euler s relation . in higher dimensions ,",
    "linear dependence between the components of the @xmath2-vector causes the covariance matrix of the @xmath2-vector to be singular .",
    "these type of linear dependencies are known as dehn - sommerville equations for simplicial polytopes [ 6 ] .",
    "a singular covariance matrix leads to zero eigenvalues in the diagonalization of the covariance matrix . in practice ,",
    "the distinction between non - zero eigenvalues and approximately zero eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix was easy to identify .",
    "in such case , let the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix that are close to zero be eliminated to ensure that @xmath90 is well - defined .",
    "so define a new matrix @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a @xmath93-by-@xmath93 matrix with the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath85 that are close to zero eliminated .",
    "also define a new matrix @xmath94 where the eigenvector @xmath95 corresponds to the @xmath96 eigenvalue .",
    "then let @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the @xmath75 re - centered @xmath2-vector .",
    "then @xmath99 is now a standardized data set with mean 0 and identity sample covariance .",
    "after standardization , one can now compare the standardized @xmath2-vectors to the standard gaussian distribution , in terms of the kolmogorov distance .",
    "the kolmogorov distance between two random variables @xmath100 is defined to be @xmath101-{\\mathbb{p}}[y\\le t]|$ ] .",
    "observe that since the standardized data are conjectured to be approximately gaussian , any linear combination of their components should also be close to gaussian .",
    "this motivates the following numerical test .",
    "fix @xmath102 , and let @xmath103 be @xmath102 independent samples of uniformly chosen points on the sphere in @xmath104 . for each @xmath105 , compute the kolmogorov distance @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the empirical cumulative distribution function of the data projected onto the direction @xmath105 ; that is , @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution . finally , define a measure @xmath20 of the distance from the data to gaussian by @xmath110 the values presented in the tables in section 1 are obtained using @xmath111 .",
