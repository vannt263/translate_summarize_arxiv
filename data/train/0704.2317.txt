    "relaxation of complex systems is often characterized by a fast dynamics during a short initial stage , while the remaining period lasts much longer and it evolves along low - dimensional surfaces in the phase space known as slow invariant manifolds ( sim ) . in that scenario , a simplified macroscopic description of a complex system",
    "can be attained by extracting only the slow dynamics and neglecting the fast one .",
    "for this reason , much effort was spent to develop model reduction methods ( the method of invariant grid ( mig ) @xcite , the intrinsic low dimensional manifold method ( ildm ) @xcite , the computational singular perturbation method ( csp ) @xcite , etc . ) based on the notion of sim .",
    "the introduction of a convex lyapunov function @xmath0 , whenever the complex system is supported by such a function , also proves to be very helpful in model reduction @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was shown that , through a @xmath0 function , good approximations of the sim can be found ( e.g. by constructing the spectral quasi equilibrium manifold - sqem - or the symmetric entropic intrinsic low dimensional manifold - seildm - @xcite ) and refined by some efficient mig iterations .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that the notion of qem is also very useful in different fields .",
    "for example , it was used in the implementation of lattice boltzmann schemes @xcite .",
    "construction of a qem is analytically possible by using the lagrange multipliers method .",
    "however , its implementation becomes too complicated as soon as the number of variables of the problem becomes large : efficient methods , for constructing large dimensional qem , are still missing .",
    "therefore , in the present paper the notion of quasi equilibrium grid ( qeg ) will be introduced , as a discrete analog of qem , and a constructive algorithm , applicable in any dimension , will be developed .",
    "the procedure suggested proves to be a very flexible tool , so it is possible to get some other sim approximations , all based on the previous algorithm , even more accurate than the qeg itself .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ basics ] , some basic notions are outlined : in particular , the general equations of dissipative reaction kinetics are reviewed , in the notations which are used throughout the paper . at the end of that section , the method of invariant grid ( mig ) and the notion of thermodynamic projector",
    "are briefly discussed ( section [ mig ] ) . in section [ qem_intr ] ,",
    "the qem definition and its geometrical interpretation is given , while in section [ main_alg ] the 1d quasi equilibrium grid algorithm is presented .",
    "that algorithm is also illustrated , by means of an example , in section [ ex_1d ] .",
    "the 1d algorithm extension to multi - dimensional grids is developed in section [ ext_multi ] .",
    "in particular , two possible extension strategies are analyzed : the _ straightforward extension _ ( section [ stra_exte ] ) and , by following the general idea given in @xcite , the _ flag extension _ ( section [ flag_ext ] ) . here",
    ", it is also shown how the flexibility of the flag extension allows to get sim approximation which is better than the spectral - qeg ( section [ beyond ] ) : the notions of _ guided - qeg _ and _ symmetric entropic guided - qeg _ are introduced .",
    "an illustrative example , in section [ 2d_example ] , shows how those different extension techniques work in practice . in order to find out",
    "how accurate is their sim description , they are also compared on the base of the invariance defect ( section [ compar_2d ] ) .",
    "finally , results are discussed in section [ conclus ] .",
    "in a closed system with _",
    "n _ chemical species @xmath1 , participating in a complex reaction , a generic reversible reaction step can be written as a stoichiometric equation : @xmath2 where _ s _ is the reaction index , @xmath3 ( _ r _ steps in total ) , and the integers @xmath4 and @xmath5 are stoichiometric coefficients of the step _",
    "s_. for each reaction step , we can introduce _",
    "n_-component vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with components @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the stoichiometric vector @xmath8=@xmath7-@xmath6 . for every @xmath9 the _ extensive variable _",
    "@xmath10 describes the number of particles of that species .",
    "v _ is the volume , then the concentration of @xmath9 is @xmath11 .",
    "dynamics of the species concentration according to the stoichiometric mechanism ( [ a ] ) reads : @xmath12 where dot denotes the time derivative and @xmath13 is the reaction rate function of the step _",
    "s_. in particular , the polynomial form of the reaction rate function is provided by _ the mass action law _",
    ": @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the constants of the direct and of the inverse reactions rates of the step _ s _ respectively . the most popular form of their dependence is given by the arrhenius equation : @xmath17 in the latter equation , @xmath18,@xmath19 are constants and @xmath20 , @xmath21 activation enthalpies and entropies respectively .",
    "the rate constants are not independent . indeed ,",
    "the _ principle of detail balance _ gives a relation between these quantities : @xmath22 where the positive vector @xmath23 is the equilibrium of the system ( [ b ] ) . in order to obtain a closed system of equations",
    ", one should supply an equation for the volume _",
    "v_. for an isolated system the extra - equations are @xmath24 ( where _ u _ is the internal energy ) , for an isochoric isothermal system we get @xmath25 , and so forth . for example , equation ( [ b ] ) in the latter case simply takes the form : @xmath26 finally , also other linear constraints , related to the conservation of atoms , must be considered . in general such conservation laws can have the following form : @xmath27 where @xmath28 fixed and linearly independent vectors @xmath29 are the rows of the @xmath30 matrix @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is a constant vector .      in this section ,",

    "if we turn our attention to perfectly stirred closed chemically active mixtures , then dissipative properties of such systems can be characterized with a thermodynamic potential which is the lyapunov function of equation ( [ b ] ) .",
    "that function implements second law of thermodynamics : it means that during the concentrations evolution in time , from the initial condition to the equilibrium state , the lyapunov function must decrease monotonically",
    ". therefore if @xmath33 is the lyapunov function , @xmath34 ( equilibrium state ) is its point of global minimum in the phase space .",

    "let us consider @xmath40 as a manifold of a reduced description .",
    "the invariance requirement reads : @xmath41 let @xmath42 be a projector on the tangent bundle of the manifold .",
    "the manifold @xmath40 is invariant with respect to the system ( [ b ] ) if and only if the following invariance equation ( ie ) holds : @xmath43\\mbox{\\boldmath$j$}(\\mbox{\\boldmath$c$})=0 , } & { } & { \\forall \\mbox{\\boldmath$c$ } \\in \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\omega$}. }   \\end{array}\\ ] ] when the manifold is not invariant , it is not able to satisfy the invariance condition",
    "so that : @xmath44\\mbox{\\boldmath$j$}(\\mbox{\\boldmath$c$}_0)\\neq0,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the defect of invariance . one way to find the sim is to solve the ie iteratively starting from an appropriate initial manifold .",
    "let us now discuss further the projector appearing in the invariance equation .",
    "it is an operator which for each point @xmath46 projects the vectors @xmath47 onto the tangent subspace of the manifold producing , in this way , the induced vector field @xmath48 . in general , condition ( [ inv.equation ] ) does not require any special constraint for the projector @xmath42 .",
    "however , the thermodynamic properties of the kinetic equations ( [ b ] ) define the projector unambiguously @xcite . to this end , let us define a differential of @xmath0 , that is linear functional : @xmath49 a special class of projectors is the thermodynamic one .",
    "if a projector belongs to this class then the induced vector field respects the dissipation inequality : @xmath50 it has been shown that a projector @xmath42 respects the ( [ thermo.condition.1 ] ) if and only if @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes the null - space of an operator .",
    "it is clear now that if one wants to solve equation ( [ inv.equation ] ) , then a projector must be specified . here",
    "we remind the way to construct the thermodynamic projector which will be used in mig procedure @xcite .",
    "this projector depends on the concentration point and on the tangent space to the manifold @xmath40 .",
    "we are looking for a grid approximation of a @xmath53-dimensional sim .",
    "let @xmath54 be a discrete subset of a @xmath53-dimensional parameter space @xmath55 and let @xmath56 be a mapping of @xmath54 into the concentration space .",
    "if we select an approximation procedure to restore the smooth map @xmath57 from the discrete map @xmath56 ( we need a very small part of @xmath57 , derivatives of @xmath57 in the grid points only ) , then the derivatives @xmath58 are available , and for each grid point the tangent space is : @xmath59 we assume that one of points @xmath60 maps into the equilibrium , and in other points intersection of the manifold with @xmath0 levels is transversal ( i.e. @xmath61 for some @xmath62 ) .",
    "let us consider the subspace @xmath63 .",
    "in order to define the thermodynamic projector , it is required , if @xmath64 , to introduce the vector @xmath65 which satisfies the following conditions : @xmath66 let @xmath67 be the orthogonal projector on @xmath68 with respect to the entropic scalar product ( [ entr.prod ] ) , then the thermodynamic projection of a vector @xmath69 is defined as : @xmath70      when mig method is applied , not a manifold is searched as a solution , but a set of concentration points whose defect of invariance is sufficiently small : let @xmath40 denote that solution ( invariant grid ) .",
    "mig is an iterative procedure : this means that , at the beginning , only an initial approximation @xmath71 of @xmath40 is available . in general , @xmath71 does not respect the invariance condition ( [ inv.equation ] ) satisfactorily so the ( [ inv.defect ] ) holds : for this reason the position of @xmath72 must be changed .",
    "we can think to correct its position and get a new point ( @xmath73 ) with a lower defect of invariance @xmath74\\mbox{\\boldmath$j$}(\\mbox{\\boldmath$c$}_0 + \\delta\\mbox{\\boldmath$c$})$ ] . if the initial node is `` not far '' from the invariant manifold , a reasonable way to get the node correction @xmath75 is to solve the linearized invariance equation where the vector field @xmath76 is expanded to the first order and the projector @xmath42 to the zeroth order : @xmath77[\\mbox{\\boldmath$j$}(\\mbox{\\boldmath$c$ } ) + \\mbox{\\boldmath$l$}(\\mbox{\\boldmath$c$})\\delta",
    "\\mbox{\\boldmath$c$ } ] = 0.\\ ] ] @xmath78 is the matrix of first derivatives of @xmath76 ( jacobian matrix ) .",
    "the newton method with incomplete linearization consists of the equation ( [ lin_inv_eq ] ) supplied by the extra condition @xcite : @xmath79 the additional condition ( [ ker_proj ] ) and the atoms balances ( [ cons.law ] ) automatically can be taken into account choosing a basis \\{@xmath80 } in the subspace @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath82 , then the correction can be cast in the form @xmath83 , so that the linearized invariance equation ( [ lin_inv_eq ] ) becomes the linear algebraic system in terms of @xmath84 : @xmath85 _ remark .",
    "_ here the usual scalar product @xmath39 was used to get the components of the left - hand side of ( [ lin_inv_eq ] ) in the basis vectors \\{@xmath80}. nevertheless , a different scalar product can be also used without a loss of generality .    in the case of the thermodynamic projector",
    ", it proves convenient to choose the basis \\{@xmath80 } orthonormal with respect to the entropic scalar product ( [ entr.prod ] ) and write the ( [ nm_equation ] ) as : @xmath86 the projector ( [ thermo.projector ] ) is `` almost '' @xmath87orthogonal ( @xmath88 ) close to the sim . because of that special feature , equation ( [ nm_equation_entr ] ) can be approximated and simplified as follows : @xmath89 note that , in general , an approximation carried out by eq .",
    "( [ new.meth.orth ] ) leaves a residual defect ( [ inv.defect ] ) in the grid nodes which can not be completely annihilated .",
    "therefore , when a higher accuracy in the sim description is required , equation ( [ nm_equation ] ) is recommended .",
    "an alternative approach to solve eq .",
    "( [ lin_inv_eq ] ) is the _ relaxation method_. according to that method the correction is written as @xmath90 , and the quantity @xmath91 is obtained from the condition : @xmath92[\\mbox{\\boldmath$j$ } + \\tau ( \\mbox{\\boldmath$c$})\\mbox{\\boldmath$l$ } \\delta ] } \\right\\rangle   = 0,\\ ] ] and solving with respect to @xmath93 : @xmath94 equation ( [ tau.relaxation ] ) shows that the relaxation method is explicit , but as it adjusts the node position acting only along the direction of the defect @xmath95 , typically we expect it to be less efficient in comparison with the newton method . on the other hand ,",
    "this method is particularly easy to implement .",
    "any iterative procedure needs to be supplied by a first approximation . since it plays an important role for both the convergence and efficiency , that approximation must be chosen very carefully .",
    "it was shown that a reasonable way , for initializing the mig , is to construct the quasi equilibrium manifold ( qem ) @xcite .",
    "solution trajectories in the phase - space must obey the set of ode equations ( [ d ] ) .",
    "moreover , all trajectories also satisfy a subset of linear equations ( [ cons.law ] ) which represent the atom conservation . among all the concentration points , that fulfill the latter constraints , we can choose those points which minimize the lyapunov function @xmath0 of the system we are dealing with .",
    "such points lie on a manifold that is called _ quasi equilibrium manifold _ ( qem ) .",
    "let us suppose that some steps of a complex reaction are faster than some others .",
    "since the lyapunov function g must decrease during the fast dynamics then , when the fast motion is exhausted , the @xmath0 value is expected to be the minimum on that fast hyperplane .",
    "in such a situation , a qem attempts to achieve a motion decomposition into fast - toward the qem - and slow - along the qem .",
    "if the invariant manifold exists , the qem can be taken as a reasonable approximation of it . in order to be more specific ,",
    "let a chemical system have @xmath96 reactive species .",
    "the degrees of freedom of that system are @xmath97 because of the atom balances ( [ cons.law ] ) .",
    "if @xmath98 is the dimension of the qem , then the macroscopic variables for its description are @xmath99 so that : @xmath100 . here",
    ", the @xmath96-dimensional vectors @xmath101 are related to the hypothetic fast directions . from a mathematical standpoint ,",
    "the solution of a variational problem : @xmath102    ) .,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    represents the qem corresponding to the vector set @xmath103 .",
    "we want to stress the geometry behind ( [ qem_problem ] ) because it will be extensively exploited in the following .",
    "the geometric interpretation of a qem is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ geom_mean ] for a @xmath104-dimensional phase - space @xmath105 .",
    "let us consider the points where @xmath0 level curves ( convex curves in figures [ geom_mean ] ( a)-(b ) ) are cut by the qe - manifolds ( bold curves ) : in those points the inclination of the tangent to the @xmath0-level curves is constant .",
    "different qem can be obtained by choosing different vector sets @xmath103 .",
    "a special choice is done when @xmath106 are the @xmath53 left eigenvectors of the jacobi matrix @xmath107 corresponding to the @xmath53 smallest absolute eigenvalues . in that particular case ,",
    "solution of ( [ qem_problem ] ) has its own name : _ spectral quasi equilibrium manifold _ ( sqem ) @xcite",
    ".      the minimization problem ( [ qem_problem ] ) can be , in principle , solved by the method of lagrange multipliers .",
    "however , it is also well known that , when the number of constraints and variables increases , then that method becomes prohibitively complicated to implement .",
    "since the number of species and elementary reaction steps is usually quite high , the lagrange multipliers method is not suitable for most of the practical cases .",
    "for this reason , in the sequel a new procedure to overcome that issue is presented .",
    "an algorithm ( _ quasi equilibrium grid algorithm_-qega ) , which can be easily implemented in order to get a discrete analog of a qem in any dimension , is developed .",
    "this is achieved by investigating further the qem geometrical construction .",

    "let us assume that the node @xmath108 belongs to that manifold .",
    "one may now imagine to look for a new node @xmath109 which still lies on the quasi equilibrium manifold .",
    "in general , the node @xmath109 can be obtained from @xmath108 by adding a shift @xmath110 : @xmath111 .",
    "that idea is applicable whenever a qem - node @xmath112 is known and a new one @xmath113 must be found ( see fig .",
    "[ sqeg01 ] ) : @xmath114 first of all , any node @xmath115 has to fulfill the atom balances ( [ cons.law ] ) .",
    "let @xmath116 be a basis in the null space of matrix @xmath117 .",
    "a convenient way to take automatically into account the conditions ( [ cons.law ] ) is to express any shift @xmath118 as a linear combination of vectors @xmath119 : @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the dimension of the basis @xmath116 . by referring to fig .",
    "[ sqeg01 ] , let us now discuss further the tangent space @xmath122 to the @xmath0 level surface in any quasi - equilibrium point @xmath113 .",

    "the line @xmath123 passing from @xmath113 and @xmath115 has the parametric form @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is a vector of @xmath122 spanning @xmath123 while @xmath126 is a parameter .",
    "in general , the linear constraints of the problem ( [ qem_problem ] ) can be also written as : @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath29 are the reduced variable vector ( @xmath129 ) and the generic row of matrix @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "the vector @xmath125 , that respects ( [ null_space_t ] ) , can always be written as a linear combination of some vectors @xmath130 , where @xmath131 denotes a basis in the null space of that matrix @xmath132 , whose first row is given by @xmath128 and the rest by the rows of @xmath117 : @xmath133.\\ ] ] note that the dimension of @xmath131 is @xmath134 . by looking at fig .",
    "[ sqeg01 ] , the _ quasi - equilibrium requirement _ simply becomes the orthogonality condition : @xmath135 which also means : @xmath136 the quasi - equilibrium grid algorithm is based on the equation system ( [ orthogonality02 ] ) and two more assumptions .",
    "first of all , we suppose that the known node @xmath112 is close to the qem , although it does not necessarily belong to the qem .",
    "secondly , let the vector @xmath118 be small enough , so that the gradient @xmath137 can be approximated to the first order : @xmath138 where @xmath139 $ ] denotes again the matrix of second derivatives of the function @xmath0 evaluated at the point @xmath112 . by substituting equations ( [ approx ] ) and ( [ basis_ker ] ) in ( [ orthogonality02 ] )",
    ", we obtain : @xmath140 by using the entropic scalar product ( [ entr.prod ] ) , equations ( [ sqeg_alg01 ] ) can be cast into the form : @xmath141 both the matrix @xmath142 and the gradient @xmath143 are calculated at the known node @xmath112 .",
    "note that the right - hand side of ( [ sqeg_alg02 ] ) vanishes if the node @xmath144 belongs to the qem . the node collection , subsequently evaluated through ( [ sqeg_alg02 ] ) , will be called a _ quasi equilibrium grid _ ( qeg ) .",
    "note , however , that the system ( [ sqeg_alg02 ] ) is not closed ( @xmath145 unknowns @xmath146 , but @xmath134 equations ) because it lacks a further information about the grid spacing .",
    "a reasonable closure for that system can be achieved by fixing the grid spacing ( e.g. in the euclidean sense ) : @xmath147 where @xmath148 is a given number and @xmath149 represents the euclidean norm of the vector @xmath118 .",
    "the smaller @xmath148 is chosen , the more accurate the expression ( [ approx ] ) gets .",
    "as it will be shown later on , for small @xmath148 the quasi equilibrium grid lies very close to the correspondent quasi equilibrium manifold .",
    "the extra condition makes ( [ full_qeg_sys ] ) a non - linear algebraic system . a way to solve it",
    "will be now discussed .",
    "the idea is to find the general solution of the linear system ( [ sqeg_alg02 ] ) , and then to choose the one which also fulfills the non linear condition in ( [ full_qeg_sys ] ) .",

    "that is not crucial , but it proves to be convenient in the following analysis ; indeed the non - linear system ( [ full_qeg_sys ] ) now is cast as follows : @xmath150 the general solution of ( [ sqeg_alg02 ] ) can always be written as : @xmath151 = w\\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}c }     { \\nu_1 }   \\\\     { \\vdots }   \\\\     { \\nu_z }   \\\\ \\end{array } } \\right ] + \\left [ { \\begin{array}{*{20}c }     { p_1 }   \\\\     { \\vdots}\\\\     { p_z }   \\\\ \\end{array } } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath152 is a free parameter , while @xmath153^t$ ] and @xmath154^t$ ] are the solution of the homogeneous problem and a special solution of ( [ sqeg_alg02 ] ) , respectively . without any restriction , we assume @xmath155 . once @xmath156 and @xmath157 are known , the non linear equation of ( [ full_sys_normalized ] ) can be written , in terms of @xmath152 , as : @xmath158 if the solvability condition is satisfied , @xmath159 then the two real valued solutions of ( [ equat_q ] ) ( @xmath160 , @xmath161 ) , upon substitution into ( [ gen_sol ] ) , give two possible sets @xmath162 $ ] .",
    "therefore , by using the ( [ shift ] ) and ( [ basis_ker ] ) , two new nodes @xmath163 ( both close to the quasi equilibrium curve ) can be evaluated from the previous one @xmath144 ( see fig . [ sol_double ] ) .",
    "a criterion , able to choose between those two solutions , depends on the phase - space zone where the grid needs to be constructed .",

    "if the qeg - nodes are close to the qem , then the non - homogeneous terms can be neglected ( they vanish on the qem ) .",
    "therefore , a reasonable approximation of the system ( [ sqeg_alg02 ] ) is given when @xmath169 .",

    "let us consider a 2-dimensional grid . in that case",
    ", the spectral decomposition of a symmetric operator is performed only over the nodes of an one - dimensional grid .",
