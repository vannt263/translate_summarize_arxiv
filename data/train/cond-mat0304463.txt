    "molecular nanomagnets , inorganic complexes with tens of magnetic metal centers linked by organic ligands , are a new class of magnetic materials exhibiting fascinating quantum properties . for instance , quantum tunneling of the magnetization has been observed in clusters like mn@xmath3 and fe@xmath1,@xcite now called single molecule magnets .",
    "another class of molecular nanomagnets is established by the molecular wheels as represented by the prototype fe@xmath4.@xcite these antiferromagnetic cyclic clusters show pronounced steps in the magnetization curve at low temperature signaling quantum size effects.@xcite furthermore , the possibility of coherent tunneling of the nel - vector has been suggested in these compounds.@xcite yet other systems like molecular grids,@xcite tetranuclear star like clusters,@xcite the cluster v@xmath5,@xcite or the magnetic keplerate mo@xmath6fe@xmath7 @xcite attracted much interest due to their peculiar magnetic properties .",
    "the magnetism of these polynuclear complexes is , in principle , described by a microscopic spin hamiltonian which to a very good first approximation consists of terms representing isotropic heisenberg exchange interactions and dipole - dipole interactions among different spin centers within a molecule , and terms due to the ligand field and zeeman interaction for each single ion.@xcite intermolecular interactions are usually very small and can be neglected .",
    "the isotropic heisenberg terms are dominant in general and these clusters may be thus described as ( antiferromagnetic ) heisenberg spin clusters with weak magnetic anisotropy .    for a detailed understanding of the properties of molecular nanomagnets it is of great importance to be able to study both the effects due to the heisenberg interaction and anisotropic terms .",
    "although rarely achieved in praxis for these rather large molecules , the ultimate goal would be to determine all relevant parameters of the microscopic spin hamiltonian like exchange constants , single ion zero - field - splittings , etc .. besides the obvious relevance in understanding the physics , the results are of great help also for synthetic chemists as they allow to establish magneto - structural correlations which in turn provide ideas for a controlled improvement of these systems.@xcite    inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) has been demonstrated to be a powerful experimental tool in this regard . @xcite",
    "being a spectroscopic technique , ins provides direct access to energy splittings .",
    "the ins cross section is controlled by the favorable selection rule @xmath8 .",
    "ins thus allows to detect the splitting of individual spin multiplets , as epr ( @xmath9 ) , but also the splitting produced by the magnetic interactions . as a result",
    ", ins provides a very straightforward determination of exchange parameters .",
    "it requires , however , large amounts of sample and , frequently , deuteration .",
    "accordingly , only powder samples of molecular nanomagnets were investigated so far .    as a unique feature",
    ", ins additionally allows to measure the dependence of the ins intensity on the scattering vector @xmath10 . in this work",
    "only the situation of powder samples will be considered , i.e. the ins cross section has to be averaged in @xmath10 space and the scattering intensity will depend only on the momentum transfer @xmath0.@xcite on the one hand , the @xmath0-dependence allows to distinguish magnetic excitations from vibrational excitations.@xcite on the other hand , and more importantly , the @xmath0-dependence allows discriminating clearly between various types of magnetic transitions.@xcite thus , the observed @xmath0-dependence of a transition can be used in addition to its energy for a spectroscopic assignment removing ambiguities in many cases .",
    "this advantage has been explored in several works , a particular illustrative example is given by the tetranuclear cluster [ co@xmath2(h@xmath11o)@xmath11(pw@xmath12o@xmath13)@xmath11 ] for which the @xmath0-dependence was key to establish the correct model.@xcite    as for the origin of the @xmath0-dependence , it is well known that it depends sensitively on the wave functions of the states involved in a transition.@xcite in the formula for the ins cross section the matrix elements for individual spin centers are correlated to their geometrical arrangement and the momentum transfer via a term @xmath15 $ ] . here , @xmath16 denotes the position vector of the @xmath17-th metal center .",

    "this work aims at showing how the @xmath0-dependence is influenced by the molecular symmetry of the spin cluster and in particular , if the molecular symmetry is high enough , that it is actually predetermined by it .",
    "the arguments will be detailed for the particular cases of the cyclic spin clusters with focus on the molecular wheel cr@xmath1,@xcite and the tetranuclear star like cluster fe@xmath2.@xcite the molecular wheel cr@xmath1 and star like cluster fe@xmath2 were chosen as examples as they both exhibit a very high molecular symmetry and detailed ins experiments were performed recently.@xcite additionally , the heisenberg interaction is much stronger than the anisotropic terms in both compounds .",
    "ins measurements on powder samples thus provide an excellent view on their internal spin structure .",

    "the number of classes @xmath89 allowed by the spin permutational symmetry turned out to be essential : the smaller the number of classes is , the fewer spin matrix elements remain uncorrelated , and the more effective the whole procedure becomes .",
    "the two cases discussed here are in a sense extreme as the number of classes @xmath89 produced by the symmetry operations was very small , being even one for the cyclic spin cluster .",
    "the procedure of how to calculate the effects of the spatial symmetry has been worked out here only for the case of one - dimensional irs .",
    "this might appear as a significant restriction , but it is sufficient for many practical cases . for instance , in the cases presented here , the full symmetry group actually had two - dimensional irs .",
    "this has been handled by first considering a subgroup with only one - dimensional irs , calculating the interference terms for this situation , and then , in a second step , to take into account the degeneracies imposed by the full symmetry by simply adding the corresponding intensities . in the present cases this was quite trivial as the interference terms were identical for the involved degenerate states . in the general case",
    ", one has to work out the relationship between the involved matrix elements .",
    "however , since it is entirely determined by transformation properties it can be calculated using the generalized wigner - eckhard theorem and the irreducible operators as appropriate for the symmetry group @xmath77.@xcite    this approach worked for the cyclic and star like clusters without loss of information about the @xmath0-dependence because the symmetry elements of the subgroup were complete enough to produce the minimal number of classes",
    ". that is , exactly the same class structure as for the full symmetry group was obtained .",
    "certainly , if this does not hold , one either has to accept additional undetermined matrix elements in the analytical expression for the @xmath0-dependence , or has to start right away from the general , but somewhat involved , equation eq .",
    "( [ sj_to_si ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the outlined strategy works for quite a number of important cases .",
    "for instance , tetranuclear clusters of the so called cubane structure are very frequent and constitutes an important class of tetranuclear compounds .",
    "actually , a significant number of tetranuclear clusters with a different topology ( e.g. grids , squares , or chains ) became available only recently due to advances in inorganic chemistry .",
    "the metal centers in these complexes approximate a tetrahedron , i.e. exhibit a rather high molecular symmetry .",
    "however , the c@xmath2 subgroup is sufficient to connect all spin centers by symmetry elements resulting in only one class @xmath89 including all spin centers .",
    "thus , these clusters can be handled in exactly the same way as the cyclic spin clusters .    in many cases",
    ", the molecular cluster does not exhibit a high symmetry exactly , but approximates it with small distortions .",
    "the bessel functions will be affected only slightly since deviations from the regular positions of the spin centers are smaller than the distances between the spin centers .",
    "furthermore , the distorted structure also leads only to small changes in the parameters of the spin hamiltonian , which typically have no effect on the energy spectrum up to first order in perturbation theory.@xcite as a result , the interference terms are actually rather insensitive to weak distortions from an assumed optimal symmetry .",
    "the @xmath0-dependencies as calculated for the approximate symmetry are then nonetheless useful , in particular as the accuracy of experimental @xmath0-dependencies is often limited .    with regard to the behavior of the ins intensity for @xmath0 approaching zero , it has been found for the cyclic clusters that it drops to zero if states with different spatial spin quantum numbers are involved in the transition .",
    "vice versa , it will approach a finite value only if the spatial spin quantum numbers coincide .",
    "this is a very general feature for clusters for which all spin centers are connected by elements of the symmetry group @xmath77 , i.e. for which only one class @xmath89 appears . with this reasoning in mind , the different behavior of the @xmath0-dependencies of the transitions observed for e.g. the dimer tb@xmath11br@xmath212 becomes immediately transparent @xcite - it is a result of the inversion symmetry of the dimer .",
    "these differences for @xmath213 were used in this case with advantage to confirm the assignment of observed peaks to theoretically expected transitions.@xcite as is clear from the discussion of the tetranuclear star like cluster , this kind of argumentation does not apply to cases in which more than one class @xmath89 arise .",
