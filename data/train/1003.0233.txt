    "if we assumed that values of measured observables of a quantum system in all possible setups were completely independent of and unaffected by measurements of other observables of the same system , then  according to the kochen - specker theorem  we would run into a contradiction for particular setups .",
    "such setups that can not be given a classical interpretation were not easy to find and only a handful of them have been found until 2004 by simon kochen and e. p. specker @xcite , asher peres @xcite , jason zimba and roger penrose @xcite , adn cabello @xcite , michael kernaghan @xcite , and others @xcite . in 2004",
    "we designed an algorithm and wrote programs for exhaustive generation of kochen - specker ( ks ) setups by means of mmp diagrams ( hypergraphs ) , state evaluation , and interval analysis .",
    "@xcite    in a 3-dim space there is a correspondence between the mmp diagrams applied to a generation of orthogonal vectors from the hilbert space and the greechie diagrams of orthomodular lattices ( omls ) underlying the space .",
    "the correspondence stems from the fact that a 3-dim system of equations representing orthogonalities as defined in a ks setup can have real solutions only for loops of order five and bigger and that means that mmp diagrams can be interpreted as greechie diagrams of omls .",
    "@xcite ( greechie diagrams with a loop of order less then five do not represent a lattice . ) hence , when we want to find ks vectors we first find omls that do not admit a classically strong set of states ( def .",
    "[ def : strong ] ) of type 0 - 1 and only then we look whether there are underlying vectors according to the procedure given in  @xcite .",
    "this result also enables us to take the opposite approach and find omls that do not admit a strong set of states at all ( def .",
    "[ def : strong ] ) .",
    "since any hilbert space admits a strong set of states this means that such omls can not underly any hilbert space and that there can not exist `` quantum states '' defined on such omls in the same sense in which there can not exist 0 - 1 ( `` classical '' ) states on ks omls .",
    "thus we can view our generation of omls that do not admit a strong set of states as a kind of _ reverse kochen - specker theorem_. of course , since no strong set of states is admitted there can be no vectors underlying these omls and they can not be used for proving the kochen - specker theorem .",
    "nevertheless the project turns out to be equally complicated as the aforementioned exhaustive generation of omls that do not admit 0 - 1 for the aforementioned kochen - specker setups but fortunately our previous results help .",
    "@xcite    our approach is based on generating and recognising orthomodular lattices that do not admit any of the properties of hilbert lattices underlying hilbert space .",
    "so no set of experimental detections along directions determined by such orthomodular lattices could be consistent with any quantum measurement .",
    "note here that we can not have a simple inversion , i.e. , we can not have classical measurement that would not be quantum because the distributivity is a stronger property than orthomodularity or modularity and non - orthomodularity immediately means non - distributivity as well .",

    "orthomodular lattices with `` exactly one state , '' reviewed in 2008 by mirko navara @xcite and also called _ nearly exotic _ @xcite .",
    "orthomodular lattices with exactly one state were considered by frederic w.  shultz @xcite , pavel ptk @xcite , mirko navara @xcite , hans weber @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "they proved useful in obtaining many new properties of orthomodular lattices and other algebras .",
    "we realized that orthomodular lattices with exactly one state are examples of our `` non - quantum '' lattices after we proved that their single states can not belong to a strong set of states .",
    "we then noticed that apparently no one of the authors pointed out that their orthomodular lattices with exactly one state do not admit a strong set of states and apparently also not any stronger condition than the orthomodularity itself and we considered that worth checking .",
    "our approach in the present paper is to apply our algorithm for exhaustive generation of arbitrary 3d mmp diagrams to obtain orthomodular lattices with exactly one state .",
    "as an example we generate the smallest greechie diagrams of the kind with 35 - 35 atoms / blocks ( vertices / edges ) to 38 - 38 atoms / blocks , present some of them graphically and discuss their properties .",
    "we also announce a new generation of algorithms and programs that will be specially designed for obtaining such lattices for arbitrary high number of atoms / blocks theoretically and much higher number of them realistically .",
    "closed subspaces of the hilbert space form an algebra called a hilbert lattice .",
    "a hilbert lattice is a kind of orthomodular lattice . in any hilbert lattice the operation _",
    "meet , @xmath0 , corresponds to set intersection , @xmath1 , of subspaces @xmath2 of hilbert space @xmath3 , the ordering relation @xmath4 corresponds to @xmath5 , the operation _",

    ". however , we should better use mmp diagrams for which the bare orthogonalities between vectors suffice without the exponentially increasing complexity of hasse diagrams .",
    "thus we generate orthomodular lattices as hilbert vectors with the help of mmp diagrams that are defined by means of the following mmp algorithm @xcite ( see a graphical representation in @xcite ) :    * every vertex ( atom ) belongs to at least one edge ( block ) ; * every edge contains at least 3 vertices ; * edges that intersect each other in @xmath54 vertices contain at least @xmath55 vertices .",
    "as opposed to greechie diagrams , mmp ones are bare hypergraphs  set of vertices and edges with no other meaning or conditions imposed on them .",
    "greechie diagrams are by definition a shorthand notation for hasse diagrams ; e.g. , they have a built - in condition that they can not contain loops of order ( 3 ) 4 or less for describing ( partially ordered sets ) lattices .",
    "mmp diagrams do not have any such qlimitation .",
    "for example , to obtain kochen - specker vectors we used 4d mmp diagrams with loops of order 2 .",
    "however , we always build additional conditions into the generation algorithm depending on application .",
    "for instance , while generating 3d omls or 3d hilbert vectors we built in the orthogonality conditions  by means of a preliminary pass .",
    "in 3d they have the same effect as the condition of not having loops of order 4 or less but are much more efficient and speed up the programs tremendously .",
    "the 3d mmp diagrams we obtain in the next section are also    greechie diagrams because 3d mmp diagrams applied to generation of either hilbert vectors or omls are isomorphic ( at the level of vertices and edges ) to correlated greechie diagrams .",

    "this also applies to counterfactual orientation of experimental setups in the same way in which it works for kochen - specker setups . with the latter setups it is impossible to obtain consistent classical 0 - 1 measurement outcome and with our setups it is impossible to obtain consistent quantum outcomes .",

    "* none of the obtained states belongs to a strong set of states , while it is apparently possible to have an oml admitting only one strong state as indicated by ptk results for posets  @xcite .",

    "therefore we might view the former states as a kind of `` reverse kochen - specker theorem '' as explained in the introduction . * none of the generated omls pass any known stronger than orthomodularity condition as , e.g. , godowski equations ( because they do not admit strong states ) or orthoarguesian equations @xcite .",
    "* omls that admit exactly one state that does not belong to a strong set of states are not limited only to those omls that have equal number of atoms and blocks as 73 - 78 given in footnote [ footnote : weber - single ] proves .",

    "we should stress here that the above omls with with exactly one state can not be enlarged so as to become a sublattice of a hilbert lattice because the orthoarguesian equations that have to hold in any hilbert lattice fail in all above omls . and",
    "if an equation fails in a sublattice ( meaning a subalgebra ) it fails in the lattice as well .    to obtain further results both on bigger omls that admit only one state and on omls that do not admit other quantum conditions we are developing new algorithms some of which",

    "these algorithms will however not enable a generation of lattices with less blocks than atoms at all , so the aforementioned project of scanning lattices with less blocks than atoms will not make use of them .",
