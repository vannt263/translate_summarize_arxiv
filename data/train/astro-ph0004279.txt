    "cataclysmic variable systems ( cv s ) , in which a white dwarf accretes material from a roche lobe filling secondary star ( see warner 1995 for an enyclopaedic review ) can be broadly divided into three subclasses : in non - magnetic systems , the white dwarf accretes via an accretion disc ; in the magnetic polars , the infalling matter couples directly onto the strong magnetic field of the white dwarf before it can build a disc and is funnelled to accretion region(s ) near the magnetic pole(s ) of the white dwarf ; finally , in cv s containing a weekly magnetic white dwarf ( intermediate polars ) , a partial disc may exist , with the mass flowing from the inner edge of the disrupted disc through magnetically funnelled accretion curtains onto the white dwarf",
    ".    dwarf novae are non - magnetic cataclysmic variable stars which show characteristic eruptions with photometric amplitudes in the range of 28 magnitudes .",
    "these eruptions typically last a few days to several weeks and recur quasi - periodically on timescales of weeks up to many years .",
    "they are generally thought to result from thermal instabilities associated with hydrogen ionization in the accretion disc ( see cannizzo 1993a for a review and ludwig et al .",
    "1994 for a detailed parameter study ) .    an important boundary condition of the disc - limit - cycle model is the mass transfer rate from the secondary to the accretion disc . in most studies of dwarf",
    "nova outbursts this mass transfer rate is kept constant ( cannizzo 1993b ; ludwig & meyer 1997 ; hameury et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "duschl and livio ( 1989 ) were the first to examine combined mass transfer and disc outbursts , though within the framework of the mass transfer instability model where individual and short - lived mass transfer events are capable of producing single outbursts .",
    "smak ( 1991 , 1999 ) discussed mass transfer variations in the context of the superoutburst phenomenon in dwarf novae of the suuma type and dwarf nova outbursts with enhanced mass transfer during outburst .    king & cannizzo ( 1998 ) and leach et al .",
    "( 1999 ) tested how the accretion disc in a dwarf nova system behaves if the mass transfer from the secondary varies abruptly between different levels .",
    "they found that these mass transfer variations produce only subtle effects on normal dwarf novae , including variations in the outburst shape , and that the dwarf novae keep on having outbursts even if the transfer rate is reduced close to zero .    in spite of these efforts",
    "we are left with the question of what the real variations of the mass tranfer rates from the secondaries in dwarf nova systems are and how they can influence the outburst behaviours of the accretion discs .",
    "fortunately , nature provides an answer to the first question in the form of discless cataclysmic variables , the polars or amher systems . in these systems ,",
    "the mass transfer rate can be estimated directly from the observations because there is no accretion disc acting as a mass buffer .",
    "thus , we can use the long - term light curve of an amher system as a measure for the mass transfer variations in a fictitious but realistic dwarf nova system with the same system parameters . in the present paper , we present the results of such a numerical experiment .    in the following section , we briefly review the equations for the viscous and thermal evolution of the accretion disc , discuss the numerical methods used in our code , and compare the results of two standard models with other fine mesh computations .",
    "thereafter we derive the mass transfer rate in amher as a function of time , @xmath0 .",
    "finally , we apply this mass transfer rate to a fictitious dwarf nova and discuss the effects that can be observed in the outburst behaviour .",
    "the classical equation describing the viscous evolution of the surface density @xmath1 in a geometrically thin , axisymmetric accretion disc is obtained by combining the vertically averaged navier - stokes and mass - conservation equations : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath4 denotes the viscosity parameter , @xmath5 the gas constant and @xmath6 the mean molecular weight .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is the classical disc diffusion term and the second term describes the external mass - deposition . for the purposes of this study ,",
    "we follow cannizzo ( 1993b ) and simply add the mass lost from the secondary @xmath7(t ) in a gaussian distribution at a fixed radius near the outer edge .",
    "similarly , one can derive an energy equation ( in the central temperature @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the specific heat , @xmath11 is the local radial flow velocity , @xmath12 represents viscous heating , @xmath13 is the radiative cooling and @xmath14 the radial energy flux carried by viscous processes ( see smak 1984 ; mineshige & osaki 1983 ; mineshige 1986 ; ichikawa & osaki 1992 and cannizzo 1993b , for discussions ) .",

    ", it warrants a somewhat more detailed description .",
    "the idea of fe is to divide the region of interest ( the disc radii between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) into @xmath17 elements and to expand the function @xmath18 which is supposed to solve the differential equation with suitable functions @xmath19 for every element . in order to get a continuous solution over all elements , the functions ( @xmath20 ) of every element have to be transformed to the so - called local basis functions @xmath21 and the coefficients to the so - called nodes @xmath22",

    "the function @xmath23 has to meet the requirement formulated by garlerkin : the integral of the residuum ( which one gets by inserting eq.(3 ) into the differential equation ) weighted with the functions @xmath24 has to vanish .",
    "this requirement , the interchange of integration and summation and partial integration lead to matrix - equations of the form @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 for @xmath29 nodes ) .    to solve the differential eqs.(1 ) and",
    "( 2 ) , we have to fill @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 in the sense mentioned above and calculate @xmath33 from eq.(4 ) . after transforming to the variables @xmath34 and @xmath35",
    "we derive for the surface density from eq.(1 ) : @xmath36 similarly it is easy to obtain for the central temperature eq.(2 ) : @xmath37 the coefficients @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 the index @xmath40 refers to the value of the quantities at node number @xmath40 , which is equivalent to the radius @xmath41 .",
    "notice that we only used linear basis functions in this paper .",
    "as mentioned above , eq.(4 ) has to be solved to get @xmath42 from @xmath43 .",
    "using simple finite differences leads to @xmath44    comparison with cannizzo ( 1993b , his fig.6d ) . from top to bottom we used 40 , 60 , 80 , 100 and 200 nodes .",

    "our code acurately reproduces the sequence of one long outburst followed by two short outbursts.,width=340 ]    in order to test our code , we carried out two sets of calculations using the binary parameters and cooling functions from cannizzo ( 1993b ) @xmath45 and ludwig & meyer ( 1997 ) @xmath46 the resulting light curves are shown in figs.[cannizzo ] and [ ludwig ] .",
    "our code reproduces the sequence of only relatively long outbursts found by cannizzo ( 1993b ) for the parameter of sscygni as well as the sequence of one long outburst followed by two short outbursts found by ludwig & meyer ( 1997 ) to describe vw hydri .",
    "the short outbursts arise when there is not enough mass stored in the disc and therefore the heating wave gets reflected before it has reached the outer edge of the disc .",
    "we find that at least @xmath47 nodes are necessary for long - term convergence .",
    "the outburst and quiescence duration decreases with an increasing number of nodes because - with finer zoning - the length of time spent on the viscous plateau becomes shorter ( cannizzo 1993b ) .",
    "this effect is smaller in fig.[ludwig ] because the disc is smaller in this system .",
    "we conclude that our fe - code produces results which are in excellent agreement with those of other fine - mesh computations .",
    "the strong magnetic field of the white dwarf primary in polars prevents the formation of an accretion disc . without an accretion disc",
    "acting as a buffer for the transferred mass , the mass loss rate from the secondary equals the mass accretion rate on the white dwarf _ at every moment _ , @xmath48 ( the free - fall time is @xmath49h ) . as an observational consequence ,",
    "any variation in rate at which the secondary star loses mass through the @xmath50 point will result in a quasi - immediate change of the observed accretion luminosity .",
    "the brightest polar , amher , has been intensely monitored at optical wavelengths by observers of the aavso for more than 20 years and shows an irregular long - term variability , switching back and forth between high- and low states of accretion on timescales of days to months .",
    "the problem of deriving the mass loss history of the secondary star is then equivalent to that of determining the accretion luminosity @xmath51 as a function of time . as the bulk of the accretion luminosity",
    "is emitted in the x - ray regime , a bolometric correction relating the densly monitored optical magnitude to the total luminosity has to be derived .",
    "this approach has been followed in detail by hessman et al .",
    "( a&a , submitted ) using x - ray observations obtained at multiple epochs .",
    "we summarize only briefly the results here .",
    "the accretion luminosity is computed from the observed accretion - induced flux @xmath52 as @xmath53 with @xmath54 ( gnsicke et al .",
    "we further use @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 the observed soft and hard x - ray fluxes respectively .",
    "the factor three accounts for the additional cyclotron radiation emitted from the accretion column and for the thermal reprocession of bremsstrahlung and cyclotron radiation intercepted by the white dwarf and emitted in the ultraviolet ( gnsicke et al .",
    "the mass loss ( = transfer ) rate is then @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the gravitational constant and @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the white dwarf radius and mass , respectively . as the actual properties of the white dwarf in amher are still the subject of controversial discussions ( gnsicke et al .",
    "1998 , cropper et al . 1999 ) , we use the parameters of an average white dwarf , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 is shown in fig.[f - mdot ] .",
    "the average value of the mass transfer rate in amher is @xmath65 .",
    "the derived mass transfer rates of am her are in general agreement with results published in the literature .",
    "for example , beuermann & burwitz ( 1995 ) found transfer rates between @xmath66 and @xmath67 and greeley et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimated a mass transfer rate of @xmath68 for the high state of amher from far ultraviolet spectra .",
    "we devised a fictitious dwarf nova with a non - magnetic primary of mass @xmath62 and an orbital period of @xmath69 , i.e. a non - magnetic twin of amher . for these binary parameters",
    ", we obtain @xmath70 cm for the inner disc radius and @xmath71 cm for the outer edge of the disc .",
    "we then used our fe code to follow the structure of the accretion disc in our fictitious dwarf nova for 7000d , applying the variable mass transfer rate @xmath64 derived above and standard viscosity parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we show @xmath74 day - long samples of our calculations in figs.48 . in each figure , the top panel show the mass transfer rate as a function of time ( solid line ) and the average mass transfer rate @xmath75)=15.90 $ ] ( dotted line ) .",
    "the panel below displays the disc mass @xmath76 normalized with the averaged disc mass @xmath77 .",
    "the two lower panels display the light curves calculated with the varying mass transfer rate and the light curves calculated with the constant average mass transfer rate respectively .",
    "for the constant average mass transfer rate the disc goes through a @xmath78day - long cycle including one long outburst followed by two short outbursts .",
    "the long outbursts are those in which the entire disc is transformed into the hot state while the short outbursts arise when the outward moving heating wave is reflected as a cooling wave before it has reached the outer edge of the disc .",
    "our numerical experiment clearly demonstrates that the outburst light curve of the fictitious system is strongly affected by the variations of the mass transfer rate . even in the case of relatively",
    "small fluctuations effects on the outburst behaviour ( ) are clearly present in the light curve . in fig.[exam-1 ] , the mass transfer rate is always high during the 500days but the disc switches between an accretion state with only long outbursts and states where one or two short outbursts follow a long outburst .",
    "when the tranfer rate decreases somewhat ( @xmath79day200 ) , the disc does not save enough mass to create consecutive long outbursts until the mass transfer rate increases again ( @xmath79day350 ) .",
    "in addition to this effect , our experiment shows that a sharp decrease in the mass transfer rate instantaneously changes the outburst behaviour of the accretion disc . in fig.[exam-2 ] the disc first behaves as in fig.[exam-1 ] but when the transfer rate drops sharply ( day4340 ) , the long outbursts immediately vanish and the duration of the quiescent phase increases somewhat .",
    "another remarkable point is that even during relatively long periods of very low transfer rates ( fig.[exam-3 ] , days47005000 ) the disc does not stop its outburst activity but produces only short outbursts with slowly decreasing amplitudes and increasing quiescence intervals .",
    "this confirms the findings of king & cannizzo ( 1998 ) .",
    "fig.7 shows 500 days of our simulation in which the adopted mass transfer from the secondary varies strongly on a timescale of roughly 20 days .",
    "this is the most frequent case during our calculation but there are rare periods of nearly constant mass transfer .",
    "fig.8 shows the light curve of the fictitious system during 500 days in which the mass transfer rate nearly exactly equals its averaged value ( top ) . as a result",
    "the light curves computed with the real mass transfer rate and the averaged value look equal .     from top to bottom as a function of time : the mass transfer rate ( top , solid line ) , the averaged mass transfer rate ( top , dotted line ) , the normalized disc mass and the light curves produced by the fictitious dwarf nova with the variable transfer rate and the averaged transfer rate adopted from amher .",
    ", width=340 ]     the same as fig.[exam-1 ] but another snapshot of the simulation .",
    "the sharp decline of the mass transfer rate is immediately reproduced by the accretion disc.,width=340 ]     the same as fig.[exam-1 ] but another snapshot of the simulation .",
    "even the long period of low transfer rates does not stop the outburst activity of the disc.,width=340 ]    in summary , one can say that the variations of the mass transfer rate leads the disc to switch between three states in which only long outbursts occur ( @xmath80 ) , one long outburst is followed by one or two short outbursts ( @xmath81 ) , and only short outbursts occur ( @xmath82 ) .    in order to understand the described behaviour of the disc we take into account the viscous timescale @xmath83 which gives an estimate of the timescale for a disc annulus to move a radial distance @xmath84 . for the quiescent state @xmath85 and the outburst state @xmath86 and with @xmath87 ( where the mass transferred from the secondary",
    "is added to the disc ) we obtain for the viscous timescale @xmath88 the mass added to the disc during quiecence is stored in the disc because it moves inward on the long timescale @xmath85 whereas during an outburst even mass from outer regions can reach the white dwarf within a viscous timescale .",
    "this makes it possible that the mass accreted onto the white dwarf during a long outburst can be up to roughly one third of the disc mass ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "therefore the disc can relax to equillibrium with the mass transfer rate in only one outburst in the case of high transfer rates ( fig.4 ) .",
    "the prompt response of the disc to the sharp decline in the mass transfer rate ( fig.5 ) can be understood in the same way : due to the short viscous time ( @xmath86 ) the disc accretes a substantial fraction of the disc mass ( @xmath90 ) during the last long outburst which immediately prevents long outbursts when the mass transfer rate becomes low ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "finally , the long period of low transfer rates ( fig.6 ) do not prevent outbursts because the mass accreted during the short outbursts is only a few percent of the disc mass .",
    "therefore the disc relaxes to the mass transfer rate on a longer timescale .       the same as fig.[exam-1 ] but a snapshot of the simulation where the transfer rate nearly stays constant.,width=340 ]     the same as fig.[exam-1 ] but a snapshot of the simulation where the transfer rate nearly stays constant.,width=340 ]    an important point in understanding the physics of accreting binaries is to know how far the outburst behaviour and",
    "hence the resulting light curves depend on real variations of the mass tranfer rate .    to answer this question , we compare the averaged mass accretion rate onto the white dwarf with the mass transfer rate .",
    "figure9 shows that the time in which the disc relaxes to an equilibrium with the mass transfer rate depends on the occurence of long outbursts : when the accretion rate is averaged over 20days ( dotted line in fig.9 ) the mass transfer and the accretion rate correspond roughly only during periods where only long outbursts occur ( days40150 , see also fig.4 ) but for the periods where the disc goes through a cycle of short and long outbursts the accretion rate has to be averaged over 60 days to match the mass transfer rate ( days150500 ) .",
    "if the mass transfer rate drops steeply and stays in a low  state ( days47005000 in fig.10 , see also fig.6 ) , the accretion rate needs more than 60 days to follow this behaviour , because the disc produces only short outbursts in which only a small percentage of the disc mass is involved .    in order to make this plausible",
    "we give a relaxation timescale @xmath92 as the ratio of the viscous timescale in outburst with the relative mass fraction accreted during an outburst : @xmath93 for high mass transfer rates this timescale is around @xmath94 and so the correspondence of the averaged accretion rate and the mass transfer rate in fig.9 . is not surprising . in the case of low transfer rates ( fig.10 ,",
    "day 47005000 ) this timescale is longer ( @xmath95 ) because only roughly 5 percent of the disc mass are accreted during an outburst .      in the numerical experiment",
    "above , we have assumed an average white dwarf mass for the primary in amher .",
    "the literature holds a large spectrum of white dwarf mass estimates for amher , @xmath96 ( young & schneider 1981 ) , @xmath97 ( wu et al.1995 ) , @xmath98 ( mukai & charles 1987 ) , @xmath99 ( mouchet 1993 ) and @xmath100 ( cropper et al .",
    "based on the observed ultraviolet spectrum of amher and on its well - established distance , gnsicke et al . (",
    "1998 ) estimated @xmath101 cm , and , using the hamada - salpeter ( 1961 ) mass - radius relation for carbon cores , @xmath102 .",
    "as the hamada - salpeter mass - radius relation is valid for cold white dwarfs , the finite temperature @xmath103k of the white dwarf in amher would allow also somewhat higher masses , @xmath104 , which is very close to the _ average _ mass of field white dwarfs , @xmath105 , that we used .    even though we exclude a massive white dwarf based on the observational evidences , we repeated our simulation with @xmath106 in order to test the sensitivity of our results .     the mass transfer rate ( solid line ) and the accretion rate onto the white dwarf as function of time . the accretion rate",
    "is averaged over 60 days ( dashed line).,width=340 ]     the mass transfer rate ( solid line ) and the accretion rate onto the white dwarf as function of time .",
    "the accretion rate is averaged over 60 days ( dashed line).,width=340 ]    in a first step , we recompute @xmath0 from eq.([mtr ] ) with @xmath107 and a corresponding @xmath108 cm .",
    "the resulting mean accretion rate is @xmath109 , a factor 2.6 lower than before .",
    "then , we simulated once more 7000 days of disc evolution with the new @xmath110 and @xmath111 .    in fig.[exam-4 ]",
    "we show 500 days of our calculation with @xmath112 .",
    "the disc produces only short outbursts and the outburst cycle of four outbursts with decreasing amplitude is hardly changed even by drastic variations of the mass transfer rate ( day4700 ) .",
    "the different responses that our fictitious dwarf novae with @xmath105 and @xmath113 white dwarfs show to the variable mass transfer rate are easy to understand : both the increased primary mass and the decreased radius of the white dwarf reduce - as mentioned above - the derived average mass transfer rate .",
    "in addition , the outer disc radius of the fictitious system with @xmath114 increases . the disc becomes more massive , i.e. @xmath115 , because of its increased size .    due to the reduced mass transfer rate and the increased disc size , the heating waves are able to reach the outer edge of the disc only during the first outburst of the outburst cycle and only in cases where the mass transfer rate is high ( @xmath116 ) . even in this rare situation",
    "the disc stays only a few days in the hot state and accretes only a small fraction of the disc mass ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "for lower transfer rates ( the extremly more frequent case shown in fig.11 ) the heating front gets reflected before it has reached the outer edge of the disc .",
    "hence , only a small percentage of the disc mass is involved in any outburst . therefore , and due to the longer viscous timescale",
    ", the relaxation timescale given in eq.(10 ) is always larger than a few years .    summing up , the adopted primary mass and the average accretion rate play an important role on the influence that the variable mass transfer rate has on the outburst behaviour .",
    "a number of new features have been added to the well known limit - cycle model ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1981 ; smak 1982 ; cannizzo , gosh & wheeler 1982 ) .",
    "hameury et al .",
    "( 1998 , 1999 , 2000 ) have shown how the light curves change if the disc size is allowed to vary and which effects irradiation has on the outburst behaviour .",
    "additionally these authors discussed other sources of uncertainties such as the tidal torque and the evaporation of the inner parts of the disc ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ) .",
    "they concluded that all these effects must be included in order to obtain meaningful physical information on e.g. the viscosity from the comparison of predicted and observed light curves .",
    "another point of importance is the interaction of the accretion stream leaving the secondary star and the accretion disc .",
    "schreiber & hessman ( 1998 ) tested the influence of stream overflow on the disc evolution in dwarf novae .",
    "they found that significant stream overflow can lead to reversion of the inward - travelling cooling front and create an outward - travelling heating front .",
    "this behaviour would produce small dips in the light curve during the declining phase .",
    "the model we used here contains neither irradiation nor allows it the disc radi to vary .",
    "the stream mass is simply deposited in a small gaussian distribution near the outer edge of the disc .",
    "therefore we do not attempt at present a comparison with observed light curves .",
    "nevertheless , all calculated light curves with constant mass transfer from the secondary relax in a quasi - stationary outburst cycle ( of one or more outbursts ) which repeat periodically .",
    "our model shows in a qualitative way that real mass transfer variations may have a dominant influence on the outburst behaviour at least in systems with relatively small discs and strong mass transfer .",
    "there is no reason to assume that the mass transfer variations of the secondary observed in amher are not present in non - magnetic systems .",
    "our numerical experiment including realistic variations of the mass transfer rate in a dwarf nova system is , therefore , a significant step towards a better understanding of dwarf nova light curves , and , thereby , of the underlying disc limit cycle .",
    "the light curve produced by our fictitious system switches between three states depending on the actual mass transfer rate .",
    "high transfer rates lead to only long outbursts where the entire disc is transformed into the hot state . if the transfer rate is near the average value the disc goes through a cycle of three outbursts , one long outburst followed by two short ones .",
    "even long periods of low transfer rates do not force the disc to stop its outburst activity : long outbursts are suppressed and the duration of quiescence increases but the disc always produces short outbursts . from this follows that the low - states of vy sculptoris stars ( a subgroup of novalike variables ) could not be caused by low transfer rates alone ( see also leach et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we find that in our fictitious system the mass accreted during an outburst cycle is dominated by the course of the mass transfer rate if the mass transfer rate varies significantly .",
    "the disc always relaxes to equilibrium with the mass input from the secondary .",
    "thus , our experiment strongly supports king & cannizzo s ( 1998 ) claim that dwarf nova accretion discs are probably never in a stationary state but are constantly adjusting to the prevailing value of @xmath118 . only during periods where the mass transfer rate is nearly exactly constant",
    "the disc periodically repeat the quasy stationary outburst cycle .",
    "such periods are rare but occur in amher .",
    "the strong influence of the mass transfer rate on the outburst behaviour of the fictitious system clearly indicates that probably most ( if not all ) the deviations from periodic outburst cycles seen in the light curves of dwarf novae are caused by variations of the mass transfer rate .",
