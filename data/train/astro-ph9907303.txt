    "considering its extreme brightness , it is perhaps surprising how little is known about  ( 0521@xmath4720 ) .",
    "one of the most luminous persistent sources in the large magellanic cloud , it is the only one of these original five bright x - ray sources to be identified as a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) . with an observed x - ray luminosity in the range 0.63@xmath510@xmath6 erg  s@xmath7 ( van paradijs 1995 ) ,  has a persistent emission which can exceed the eddington luminosity for a neutron star with a canonical mass of 1.42.0m@xmath8 , making it one of the most powerful persistently - emitting low mass x - ray binaries . because of its accurately - known distance and low line - of - sight absorption , studies of  can provide not only a clear view of the physics and dynamics of such a system , but also an important comparison with galactic lmxbs .    the spectrum of the @xmath9=18.8 optical counterpart ( johnston et al .  1979 ) shows the expected strong he  ii emission overlying a blue continuum , but the n  iii  c  iii  o  ii blend emission typically seen at @xmath104640 - 4650  is weak or non - existent ( bonnet - bidaud et al .",
    "1989 ; crampton et al .  1990 ) .",
    "the bowen blend is also absent in the optical spectra from the supersoft lmc sources , indicating that the lack of this emission is linked to the relatively low metallicity of the lmc .",
    "this underabundance may also contribute to the high luminosities observed in the lmc x - ray sources in general , compared to the galactic population .",
    "accretion of material onto compact objects may be limited by preheating due to photoelectric absorption of x - rays by the heavier elements in the material , thus sources in a lower - abundance environment might be expected to accrete closer to the eddington limit .    for  the ratio of x - ray to optical luminosities",
    "is @xmath11600 , similar to that seen in galactic lmxbs .",
    "the weakness of the 6.7 kev fe line ( white et al .",
    "1986 ; bonnet - bidaud et al.1989 ) supports the lower - abundance argument .",
    "searches for the orbital period of the system have produced contradictory results , with evidence for photometric and/or spectroscopic periods of 6.4 hr ( bonnet - bidaud et al .",
    "1989 ) , 8.16 hr ( callanan et al .",
    "1990 ) , and 12.5 days ( crampton et al .  1990 )",
    ". thus , even the nature of the companion and the scale of the binary system are unclear .",
    "a 68 hr period would imply a late - type dwarf companion , while the longer 12.5-day period would require an evolved companion in a much larger orbit ( e.g.  hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "searches of the literature and the archival holdings at the heasarc reveal that few dedicated observations of  have been performed .",
    "data from the earlier satellites consist almost entirely of surveys of ( or including ) the lmc .",
    "flux measurements prior to 1977 , and the long - term behavior of the source , are summarized in griffiths & seward ( 1977 ) .",
    "the heao-1 and einstein survey data can be found in johnston , bradt , & doxsey ( 1979 ) and long , helfand , & grabelsky ( 1981 ) .",
    "a short multiwavelength study of  was conducted by bonnet - bidaud et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , using exosat and the eso complex at la silla in 1984 .",
    "they determined that the x - ray spectra could be described using either a comptonization model , or the sum of two components , i.e.  bremsstrahlung plus a blackbody . in the first representation ,",
    "the authors note that their ability to determine the existence or non - existence of a blackbody component was strongly limited by the available statistics . in the second , the blackbody component contributed 2040% of the total emission , and the blackbody radius",
    "was found to be 610 km .",
    "variability is typically observed in the light curve on @xmath12530 min timescales , and a flare ( brightness enhancement ) was also seen .",
    "however , this flare only represents a 25% increase in the persistent emission at the end of the observation , and is not well modeled by an increase in the blackbody flux in the two - component representation .",
    "the exosat observations presented by bonnet - bidaud et al .  lasted 8.2 hours , too short to effectively search for a period in the 412 hr range or beyond .",
    "no clear correlation was observed between x - ray and optical emission , and no significant qpo or red noise features were detected in the 264  hz range studied .",

    "the @xmath1-sources are named for the three - branched shape they trace in a diagram of hard color against soft color . from top to bottom , the three branches of the @xmath1 are known as the horizontal , normal , and flaring branches ( hb , nb , fb ) , and it is believed that the accretion rate @xmath13 increases as the source moves from the hb to the fb .    the @xmath1-sources generally show quasi - periodic oscillations in their powers spectra in the 1100 hz range whose characteristics are closely correlated with their position on the @xmath1 .",
    "horizontal branch qpos , or hbos , are probably explained by a magnetospheric beat frequency model , while normal / flaring branch qpos ( n / fbos ) are related to oscillations in the accretion flow near / beyond the eddington limit . in addition , the power spectra show power - law shaped noise at frequencies @xmath141 hz ( known as very low frequency noise , or vlfn ) ; band - limited ( @xmath12110  hz ) noise with cut - off frequencies of @xmath1210  hz ( called low - frequency noise , lfn ) in the horizontal and upper part of the normal branch ; and high - frequency noise ( hfn ) with cut - off frequencies in excess of 50100 hz , which sometimes leads to a broad , peaked appearance",
    ". the currently - known @xmath1-sources are sco  x1 , gx  17@xmath152 , gx  349@xmath152 ( = sco  x2 ) , cyg  x2 , gx  340@xmath150 , and gx  5@xmath41 ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "when bright , cir  x1 also shows @xmath1-source characteristics ( shirey et al .",
    "1998 ; shirey , bradt & levine 1999 ) .    the second class , the so - called atoll sources , describe a much simpler curved banana shape in their color - color diagram , sometimes supplemented with an island of datapoints during low - luminosity intervals .",
    "the atoll sources show vlfn with a generally shallower power law index than the @xmath1-sources , and a broad low - frequency band - limited noise component often ( confusingly ) also termed hfn .",
    "both @xmath1- and atoll sources also display qpo oscillations at frequencies of 2001200 hz ( `` kilohertz qpos '' , see e.g. van der klis 1998 ) and at 160 hz ( see e.g.  the review of van der klis 1995 for the @xmath1-sources , and wijnands & van der klis 1999 and references therein for a tabular summary of such oscillations in the atoll sources ) .    to date the @xmath1-sources have tended to show longer orbital periods ( @xmath1218  hrs  10 days ) , implying evolved companions , while atoll sources tend to have orbital periods under 10 hrs . confirmed membership of one or other class has direct physical consequences for the system ; the @xmath1-source characteristics imply the existence of magnetospheres with magnetic fields of @xmath1610@xmath17 g , while the magnetic fields in the atoll sources would be substantially lower ( see psaltis , lamb , & miller 1995 ) .",
    "the difference in the nature of the companions possibly implies that @xmath1- and atoll - sources differ in their evolutionary history ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "assignation of  to one or other of these classes can only be achieved by studying the color - color diagram and the fast time variability of the source .",
    "no clear color - color correlation was observed during the exosat observations , but it is apparent from the hardness diagrams presented by bonnet - bidaud et al .",
    "( 1989 ) that the low - level variability analysis was affected by the counting statistics . despite its absolute brightness , the greater distance of relative to similar galactic sources results in a paucity of photons for high - time - resolution studies .",
    "we have therefore undertaken a program of study of  using rxte , to search for the orbital period of the system and determine the signature of its fast time variability .",
    "we have also obtained simultaneous optical coverage at saao with the 1.9 m telescope and high - speed ccd photometer , to search for correlated variability between the x - ray and optical regimes ; these data will be presented in a later publication ( mcgowan , charles , & smale 1999 ) .",
    "we observed  with rxte ( bradt , rothschild , & swank , 1993 ) between 1997 december 2 18:52 ut  december 7 1:40 ut , for an on - source total good time of 100 ksec .",
    "this time was divided into five separate observations , in an observing strategy designed to achieve the maximum amount of simultaneity with the optical coverage mentioned above .",
    "the x - ray data we present here were obtained using the pca instrument with the standard 2 and good xenon configurations , with time resolutions of 16 sec and @xmath18sec respectively .",
    "the pca consists of five xe proportional counter units ( pcus ) , with a combined effective area of about 6500 @xmath19 ( jahoda et al 1996 ) .",
    "all 5 pcus were on throughout the observations , apart from a 6000-sec interval at the beginning of the third observation during which pcu  4 was turned off . in our light curves we have included the data from this short interval normalized to 5 pcus .",
    "we performed our data extraction using the rxte standard data analysis software , ftools 4.2 .",
    "background subtraction of the pca data was performed utilizing the `` skyvle / skyactiv '' models generated by the rxte pca team .",
    "the quality of the background subtraction was checked in two ways : ( i ) by comparing the source and background spectra and light curves at high energies ( 50100 kev ) where  itself no longer contributes detectable events ; and ( ii ) by using the same models to background - subtract the data obtained during slews to and from the source .",
    "we conclude that our background subtractions in the 220 kev energy range are accurate to a fraction of a count per second .",
    "c    c    we examined the rapid aperiodic variability in  using the high time resolution pca data obtained in the good xenon mode .",
    "discrete power spectral density distributions ( psds ) were calculated by dividing the data into segments of uniform length , performing fast fourier transforms of each , and averaging the results .",
    "the psds were normalized such that their integral gives the squared rms fractional variability ( miyamoto et al 1991 ; van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "we subtracted the poisson noise level from the power spectra , taking into account the modifications expected from pca detector deadtime .",
    "as described by zhang et al ( 1995 , 1996 ) this deadtime comes in two parts : the @xmath20=10@xmath21s contribution from the events within in the time series themselves , and a @xmath22=170@xmath21s contribution from energetic cosmic ray events ( very large events , or vle ) ( see also morgan , remillard , & greiner 1997 ) .",
    "data were also obtained with the hexte phoswich detectors , which are sensitive over the energy range 15250  kev ( rothschild et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the source was detected with a background - subtracted count rate of 0.75 count  s@xmath7 .",
    "however , because of the cut - off spectral shape of , these counts were limited to energies @xmath2325 kev , and the hexte data did not in this case provide any information additional to that gained using the pca .",
    "we show the overall 1.819.7  kev x - ray light curve in fig .  1 .",
    "pronounced variability is apparent , with some evidence for a modulation on an @xmath128  hr timescale in the first four observations , and a suggestion of a similar but much lower - amplitude modulation in the fifth . using a discrete fourier transform technique optimized for unevenly - sampled time series ( scargle 1989 )",
    ", we found that the strongest peaks in the power spectrum appear at @xmath24=29446@xmath2147s and the one - day aliases of @xmath24 ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "no other significant periodicities were detected .",
    "the strength and significance of this primary peak is corroborated with a standard period - folding code utilizing the l - statistic ( davies 1990 ) , with a false alarm probability of less than 0.01% .",
    "aware of the pitfalls of detecting orbital periods in datatrains with individual lengths ( in this case averaging 20000s ) similar to the period of interest , we have scrutinized the window function of the observations ( e.g. van der klis 1989 ) ; from our fig .  2 we see that the only principal peaks in the window function correspond to the one - day and half - day artefacts from the data sampling .",
    "in addition , we have created and analyzed a series of 1000 randomized datasets with the same temporal spacing .",
    "none of the randomized datasets showed significant fourier power or l - statistic peaks in the range of candidate periods of interest ( @xmath12hrs ) .",
    "c    c    we fine - tuned our measurement of the periodicity in the x - ray data by fitting sine waves to the background - subtracted light curve in fig .  1 , and determining the error on the fitted parameters , producing a final period determination of @xmath24=29377@xmath240s = 8.160@xmath20.011 hrs .",
    "this is startlingly close to the candidate orbital period suggested by callanan et al .",
    "( 1990 ) of 8.160@xmath20.024 hrs , based on optical photometry . while the close agreement of our analysis with a ten - year - old optical result suggests that the 8.16-hr periodicity is a stable and fundamental cycle of the system , we clearly can not rule out the possibility of a sequence of flares intrinsic to the source with a fortuitous spacing .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve ( excluding the fifth observation ) folded on this period is shown in fig .",
    "the epoch of phase zero ( defined for the purposes of this paper as the ascending node of the sine wave ) is jd  245  0785.279@xmath20.003 .",
    "the modulation semi - amplitude is 24% over the entire 1.819.7 kev range used , increasing linearly with energy from 14% in the 1.8 - 4.0 kev range to 40% at 8.719.7 kev .",
    "the modulation during the fifth observation is greatly reduced but still significant , at 3.8@xmath20.1% over the 1.8 - 19.7 kev band .",
    "considerable short - timescale ( @xmath12minutes ) variability is observed in addition to the @xmath128  hr modulation .",
    "visual inspection of the folded light curve ( and detailed study of the individual light curves ) indicates that the source shows greater intrinsic x - ray variability at phases @xmath25=0.00.5 than it does at later phases . to quantify this impression",
    ", we subtracted the much longer - timescale 8.16-hr modulation from the data and subjected the resulting light curve to a simple statistical analysis : the weighted variance of the folded data is @xmath26=961.9 between @xmath25=0.00.5 , as compared with @xmath26=129.4 between @xmath25=0.51.0 .    in fig .",
    "4 we present the hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) and color - color diagram ( cd ) for the whole observation .",
    "the correlation between hardness and intensity is very tight throughout the observations .",
    "the cd shows a single straight , cohesive track with a slight hook at the bottom left corner , perhaps indicating a vertex with another branch . for the first four observations the individual hardness - intensity and color - color diagrams are indistinguishable in extent , scatter , and slope ; for the fifth observation , the data points cluster in the lower portions of the respective diagrams .",
    "c      the overall psd of the source from 0.01100  hz can be well represented using a single power law representing very low frequency ( @xmath271  hz ) noise ( vlfn ) , with shape p @xmath28 @xmath29 , plus a higher - frequency noise component which we modeled using ( i ) a cut - off power law , representing standard high frequency ( @xmath1410  hz ) noise ( hfn ) , or ( ii ) a lorentzian , representing peaked hfn .",
    "first we examined the mean power spectrum of all the observations , and then investigated it as a function of position in the hid .",
    "fits were performed in several energy ranges : 26 kev , 620 kev , 20100 kev , and 210 kev .",
    "the rms values are measured between 0.011 hz for the vlfn and 0.01100 hz for hfn , and errors are @xmath30=1.0 .    in the 26 kev power spectrum the vlfn component dominates between 0.011  hz , with best fitting parameters of @xmath31=1.50@xmath20.07 , rms=4.5@xmath20.3% .",

    "power spectra accumulated for each of the first four observations independently show no significant night - to - night change in the strength or slope of the vlfn component , and insufficient statistics to assess variability of the higher - frequency component .",

    "we have also fit a series of combination models to the data , chief among them a cutoff power law plus blackbody , bremsstrahlung plus blackbody , a pair of blackbodies , and a disk - blackbody plus blackbody .",
    "none of these combinations applied to the spectral data provided an overall goodness - of - fit statistically superior to the single - component comptonization models , and in most cases the fits themselves were insufficiently stable to determine meaningful error estimates . of the combination models , the bremsstrahlung plus blackbody fit provided the best description of the data ( despite being perhaps the least physically realistic , due to the large emitting volumes required ) , with parameters @xmath45=4.5 kev , @xmath46=1.5 kev , @xmath34=32/28 , with the blackbody making up @xmath1220% of the total flux . however , fitting the phase - selected spectra with this model we found the fit parameters were not independent , in the sense that the bremsstrahlung temperature , the blackbody temperature , the derived blackbody flux , and the proportion of the total flux made up by the black body all increased with increasing flux in a correlated fashion .",

    "we note that bonnet - bidaud et al .",
    "( 1989 ) had similar difficulties correlating the fit parameters for a bremsstrahlung plus black body model with the flux level of the source .",

    "we have detected an apparent strong 8.16-hr orbital periodicity in the x - ray flux during four observations of , with an average modulation amplitude of 24% across the 1.8 - 19.7 kev energy band . in the fifth observation ,",
    "this amplitude has dropped to 4% over the same energy band .",
    "this variability in the modulation depth , coupled with the intrinsic variability of the source , may explain why the periodicity is not evident in the public archival data from the all - sky monitor instruments on rxte , vela 5-b , and ariel v. the pointed observations of  from previous x - ray missions stored in the heasarc online archive are too short to allow a search for a @xmath128-hr periodicity ; the longest observation , performed using exosat on 1985 december 10 , lasts 18 hrs and shows 20% variability , but no clear orbital modulation .",
    "the majority of lmxbs have orbital periods of 210 hrs .",
    "if the 8-hr period were confirmed as orbital , would fall towards the upper end of this distribution , implying a dwarf companion of @xmath121@xmath53 perhaps beginning to evolve off the main sequence , with mass transfer starting to be driven by evolution of the companion .",
    "while the coincidence of the close agreement between the photometric and x - ray periodicities is impressive , we strongly advise caution . given the sampling of our data we can not rule out the possibility of a fortuitous alignment of flare episodes , mimicking a true period determination .",
    "we note that such an alignment previously produced an erroneous period determination of 8.71 days in gx  349@xmath152 ( ponman 1982 ) .",
    "( the true period of 22.5 hr was identified from optical photometry : wachter 1997 . )    in addition , the physical mechanism that might produce such a large modulation in the orbital light curve is by no means clear . at x - ray and optical energies , the shape of the observed light curves in lmxbs , and the existence of an observable modulation , depend strongly upon the inclination @xmath54 , and the thickness and geometry of the accretion disk . at high inclinations ( @xmath55 )",
    "the central source is obscured by the disk edge and the observed x - rays are scattered through an accretion disk corona , producing a light curve with a smooth sinusoidal modulation , interrupted by a partial eclipse of the adc by the companion ( white & holt 1982 , mason & crdova 1982 ) . at inclinations ( 75@xmath5680@xmath57 ) the central source is often directly visible , and the @xmath58 ratio thus significantly enhanced .",
    "sharp regular eclipses by the companion are observed , along with deep irregularly - shaped dips caused by the occultation of the central source by azimuthal structure on the accretion disk associated with the impact point of the accretion stream on the disk edge ( e.g.  x0748@xmath4676 ; parmar et al .",
    "1986 ) . at 70@xmath5675@xmath57 , x - ray dips are observed but no eclipses , and optical light curves become roughly sinusoidal , with minima occurring 0.2 in phase after the dips ( e.g. x1254@xmath4690 ; courvoisier et al .",

    "1987 ) . at inclinations",
    "lower than 70@xmath57 we cease to see eclipses or dips , and the optical light curves are generally sinusoidal ( e.g. x1735@xmath4444 , x1636@xmath4536 , corbet et al.1986 , smale & mukai 1988 ) with the exception of those sources in which ellipsoidal variations are observed from giant companions .",
    "the large - amplitude , quasi - sinusoidal x - ray modulation observed from  does not fit neatly into this picture .",
    "the deeper parts of the folded light curve are not associated with a dramatic increase in the @xmath40 , as is generally the case for a source in which the azimuthal structure plays a major role in defining the modulation , and the amplitude of the modulation itself is clearly not stable , indicating a volatile origin . neither sharp nor partial eclipses are observed , thereby limiting the source inclination to @xmath2375@xmath57 .",
    "if real , this would suggest that either the periodicity originates in : ( a ) some modulation of the mass accretion rate itself ( noting that the variations in mass accretion are also responsible for the variations of the source along the branches of the cd / hid ) , or ( b ) modulation of the flux by the azimuthal disk structure according to the accepted model for dipping sources , requiring that the source inclination falls in the narrow 70@xmath5975@xmath57 band .",
    "we note that the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of  is an order of magnitude greater than the luminosities of the galactic dipping sources , leaving us with no precedent for such a system , and that no good physical model exists for the height and distribution of the obscuring material at the disk s edge even for the lower - luminosity dipping sources .    in previous work",
    ", evidence has been presented in favor of a 12.5-day periodicity , based on optical photometry of  ( crampton et al .",
    "radial velocity measurements are inconclusive , and this longer period is not seen in the rxte asm light curve . in lmxbs with known periods in excess of a few days such as 4u0921@xmath4630",
    "( 8.99 days , and cygnus x2 ( 9.84 days ) the evolved giant companions can be independently detected from the late - type absorption spectrum underlying the strong emission - line spectrum from the accretion disk ( cowley , crampton , & hutchings 1982 ; cowley , crampton , & hutchings 1979 ) , whereas spectroscopic studies of  have as yet provided no evidence for spectral features from the secondary star ( crampton et al.1990 , bonnet - bidaud et al .",
    "1989 ) even in the near - infrared , where we might expect to see ca  ii absorption at @xmath608500  ( cowley et al .",
    "however , we can not at this time discount the possibility of a 12.5-day modulation in the system , as superorbital periodicities have been detected in several lmxbs ( e.g. 175 days in 4u1820@xmath4303 , 199 days in 4u1916@xmath4053 , see smale & lochner 1992 , and references therein ; 78 days in cyg x2 , wijnands , kuulkers , & smale 1996 ) perhaps due to precession of a tilted accretion disk . a program of long - term optical photometry of  is currently under way to resolve this question ( wachter , greene , & smale 1999 ) .",
    "an empirical relation exists between the absolute visual magnitude @xmath61 of a lmxb , its mean x - ray luminosity as a function of @xmath0 , and its orbital period ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) .",
    "( such a relationship is expected from a simple model where the bulk of the optical emission comes from  and scales with the size of  a standard accretion disk . )",

    "1989 ) , the derived absolute magnitude of @xmath40.3 leads to an expected orbital period of @xmath1217@xmath63  hrs .",
    "if our detected 8-hr periodicity does not stand the test of time , future ( x - ray or optical ) search strategies should still be focused on the 830 hr domain .",
    "from this first study of the fast timing and cd / hid properties of  we have accumulated evidence that suggests it might be a @xmath1-source . considerations of the sustained near - eddington and super - eddington luminosity , the shape and other characteristics of the color - color diagram , and the fast time variability over the 0.01100  hz range all seem to support the hypothesis .",
    "if true , we might expect to observe different branches of the @xmath1 in future observations of the source , perhaps while in intensity states differing from those observed here .",
