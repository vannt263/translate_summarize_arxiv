    "in 1997 the h1 @xcite and zeus @xcite experiments at hera reported an excess of events in positron - proton neutral current deep inelastic scattering ( nc dis ) at very high momentum transfer scales @xmath5 , as compared with the predictions of the standard model . as a possible sign of some `` new physics ''",
    "this results provoked many theoretical speculations .",
    "clustering of h1 events at a positron - jet invariant masses of about 200 gev was considered to indicate a possible resonant production of leptoquark states .",
    "the agreement with the standard model prediction improved after both experiments doubled their positron - proton data samples , but some discrepancy is still there and calls for a better understanding .    in a paper presented last year @xcite ,",
    "data from hera , lep and the tevatron , as well as from low energy experiments were used to constrain the mass scale of the possible new electron - quark contact interactions .",
    "a contact interaction model was used as the most general framework which can describe possible low energy effects coming from `` new physics '' at much higher energy scales .",
    "this includes the possible existence of second - generation heavy weak bosons , leptoquarks , as well as electron and quark compositeness @xcite .",
    "in addition to the general models , in which all new contact interaction couplings can vary independently , the global analysis considered also a set of one - parameter models which assumed fixed relations between couplings . however , only parity conserving models were selected , as suggested by zeus @xcite , to avoid strong limits coming from atomic parity violation ( apv ) measurements @xcite .",
    "no significant improvement in the description of the data has been obtained for any of these models .",
    "theoretical uncertainties in the parity violation measurements in cesium atoms have been recently significantly reduced . as a result , measured value of the cesium weak charge is now more than 2@xmath3 away from the standard model predictions @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy could be due to new parity - violating electron - quark interactions .",
    "considered in this paper are effects induced by the possible existence of the first - generation leptoquarks .",
    "predictions based on the buchmller - rckl - wyler ( brw ) effective model @xcite are compared with the existing experimental data . in the limit of very high masses",
    ", the exchange of leptoquarks can be described using the contact interaction approach @xcite .",
    "limits on the ratio of the coupling and the mass are derived . for finite leptoquark masses limits on leptoquark yukawa coupling @xmath6",
    "are studied as a function of the leptoquark mass .",
    "the aim of the present analysis is to combine the apv measurements with other data to constrain leptoquark coupling and mass , and to look for a possible leptoquark signal in the combined data . the brw model used in this analysis",
    "is described in section [ sec - model ] . in section [ sec - data ] the relevant data from hera , lep ,",
    "the tevatron and other experiments are briefly described .",
    "methods used to compare data with leptoquark model predictions and to derive coupling limits are summarised in section [ sec - method ] .",
    "the analysis results for different leptoquark types , including extracted coupling - mass limits and discussion of the possible leptoquark signal are presented in section [ sec - results ] .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on the approach used in the global analysis of @xmath7 contact interactions @xcite , which in turn followed @xcite .",
    "when finalising this analysis another work discussing leptoquark exchange as a possible explanation for the apv result was released @xcite .",
    "however , the analysis presented there is limited to the contact interaction approximation .",
    "striking symmetry between quarks and leptons in the standard model strongly suggests that , if there exist a more fundamental theory it should also introduce a more fundamental relation between them .",
    "such lepton - quark `` unification '' is achieved for example in different theories of grand unification @xcite and in compositeness models . whenever quarks and leptons are allowed to couple directly to each other",
    ", a quark - lepton bound state can also exist .",
    "such particles , called leptoquarks , carry both colour and fractional electric charge and a lepton number . also supersymmetric theories with broken r - parity predict squarks ( leptoquark type objects ) coupling to quark - lepton pairs .    in this paper a general classification of leptoquark states proposed by buchmller , rckl and wyler @xcite will be used .",
    "the buchmller - rckl - wyler ( brw ) model is based on the assumption that new interactions should respect the @xmath8 symmetry of the standard model .",
    "in addition leptoquark couplings are assumed to be family diagonal ( to avoid fcnc processes ) and to conserve lepton and baryon numbers ( to avoid rapid proton decay ) .",
    "taking into account very strong bounds from rare decays it is also assumed that leptoquarks couple either to left- or to right - handed leptons . with all these assumptions",
    "there are 14 possible states ( isospin singlets or multiplets ) of scalar and vector leptoquarks .",
    "table [ tab - aachen ] lists these states according to the so - called aachen notation @xcite .",
    "an s(v ) denotes a scalar(vector ) leptoquark and the subscript denotes the weak isospin . when the leptoquark can couple to both right- and left - handed leptons , an additional superscript indicates the lepton chirality .",
    "a tilde is introduced to differentiate between leptoquarks with different hypercharge .",
