    "the top quark as heaviest of all known quarks decays with a lifetime of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this is at least one order of magnitude shorter than the timescale of hadronization and depolarization and allows to deduce the top quark s spin information via the measurement of angular distributions of its decay products @xcite . within the standard model ( sm ) , top quarks",
    "are produced almost unpolarized via the strong interaction .",
    "however , when being produced in pairs their spins are predicted to be correlated .",
    "the degree of observed correlation depends on the production and decay mechanisms of @xmath0  pairs .",
    "deviations from the sm prediction can give hints for physics beyond the standard model , like the production via a high - mass @xmath11 boson @xcite , a heavy higgs boson @xcite or the decay of a top quark into a bottom quark and a charged higgs boson @xcite .",
    "@xmath0  spin correlations have been measured by the cdf and d0 collaborations using angular distributions of the @xmath0 decay products @xcite .",
    "the d0 collaboration reported a first evidence for non - vanishing spin correlation using a matrix - element approach in the @xmath4  channel @xcite . at the lhc",
    "@xcite the cms collaboration measured the @xmath0  spin correlation using the difference of azimuthal angles between the two charged leptons in the laboratory frame , @xmath6 , in dileptonic @xmath0  events @xcite .",
    "this observable is sensitive to @xmath0  spin correlation arising from gluon fusion production .",
    "the fact that this mechanism is dominant at the lhc and that @xmath6  can be measured without any event reconstruction ( next to the identification of spin analyzers ) makes it the preferred observable at the lhc .",
    "atlas @xcite reported the observation of @xmath0  spin correlation using 2.1  of lhc data taken at a  energy of 7  @xcite and exploited several other observables sensitive to @xmath0  spin correlations using the full 7  dataset @xcite . in the same publication ,",
    "the first measurement of @xmath0  spin correlation in the @xmath4  channel at the lhc is reported .",
    "this measurement is outlined in the following .",
    "all so far measured values of the @xmath0  spin correlation , which are complementary between tevatron and lhc measurements due to the different production mechanisms and  energies , agree with the sm predictions .",
    "for the presented measurement of @xmath0  spin correlation the full 2011 dataset , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath2  fb@xmath3and taken by the atlas detector , is used .",
    "the event selection requires one isolated lepton ( electron or muon ) and at least four jets of which at least one has to be identified as @xmath12-jet  using a neural network algorithm with a tagging efficiency of 70% . for the suppression of multijet background",
    "additional requirements on the missing transverse momentum @xmath13  and the transverse @xmath14 boson mass @xmath15  are made ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the @xmath18  channel , @xmath19 and @xmath20 in the @xmath21  channel ) .",
    "several top quark decay products can be utilized as spin analyzers to get information about the top quark spin via the measurement of their angular distributions .",
    "the sensitivity of an analyzer to the top quark spin is expressed by the spin analyzing power @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "the charged leptons @xmath24 are preferred due to @xmath25 . as the corresponding weak isospin particle from hadronically decaying @xmath14 bosons ,",
    "the down - type quark  with @xmath26 is the most powerful hadronic top spin analyzer .",
    "however , as it is hard to reconstruct the down - type quark , the @xmath12-quark  from the top quark decay is a good alternative .",
    "the lower spin analyzing power of @xmath27 is compensated by its higher reconstruction efficiency .",
    "the @xmath0  events are reconstructed using a kinematic likelihood fitter ( klfitter ) @xcite . for each possible",
    "quark - to - jet mapping it maximizes a likelihood function including constraints from the masses of the top quarks and the @xmath14 bosons as well as transfer functions describing the detector measurements of the energies of all jets and leptons from the @xmath0  decay . to get additional discrimination power to separate the light up- and down - type quarks from the hadronically decaying @xmath14 bosons , two - dimensional probability distributions of the transverse momentum versus the weight of the @xmath12-tagging algorithm",
    "are multiplied to the maximized likelihood .",
    "the first quantity is different for light up- and down - type quarks due to the v - a structure of the weak decay vertex , while the second one can separate charm / strange quark pairs . for each event , the event probabilities of all possible @xmath28 permutations are normalized and the permutation with the highest event probability is chosen .",
    "figure [ fig : eventprobability ] shows the event probability distribution of all reconstructed events .",
    "distribution of the klfitter event probabilities of the reconstructed @xmath0  events @xcite.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the peak at 0.5 illustrates the events where two permutations are undistinguishable , namely those where no charm / strange but up / down quarks are produced with a similar transverse momentum .",
    "for all events with event probabilities above 0.5 a good separation between light up- down - type quarks is reached .",
    "no cut on the event probability is applied .",
    "a binned likelihood fit is performed to fit signal and background contributions to the @xmath6  distributions in data using the down - type quark  ( @xmath29 ) and the @xmath12-quark  ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "priors corresponding to the normalization uncertainties were applied to the background and contribute to the statistical uncertainty .",
    "the @xmath0  signal is mixed out of two samples , corresponding to uncorrelated @xmath0  pairs ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath0  pairs with a spin correlation as in the sm ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the linearity of the spin correlation allows this mixing , which is determined by a parameter @xmath33 scaling the predicted @xmath0  cross section to the measured one and the parameter @xmath7 : @xmath34 the fit is performed in channels of different jet multiplicities ( 4 , @xmath35 ) , numbers of @xmath12-tagged jets ( 1 , @xmath36 ) and lepton flavours ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) . if possible , systematic uncertainties are included in the fit via nuisance parameters .",
    "the other uncertainties are evaluated via ensemble tests .",
    "the fact that the spin analyzing powers of the down - type quark  and the @xmath12-quark  have opposite signs cause the shape changes from sm spin correlation to uncorrelated @xmath0  pairs to go into opposite directions .",
    "combining the two analyzers hence reduces the effect of systematic uncertainties to a large extent .",
    "it is found that the shape is largely affected by kinematic mismodeling , in particular for the case of top quark @xmath39 .",
    "the result of the combined fit , @xmath40 , is shown in figure [ fig : result_dq ] and [ fig : result_bq ] and the uncertainties are listed in table [ tab : uncertainties ] .",
