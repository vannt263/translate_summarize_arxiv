    "no other field is involved , and the curvature perturbation is conserved after inflation ends . as a result , the spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation in this ` inflaton scenario ' is essentially determined by the inflation model alone @xcite . the only influence of the subsequent cosmology is to determine precisely the number @xmath2 of @xmath3-folds of inflation after our universe leaves the horizon .",

    "@xcite ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) that the inflaton scenario is not the only possible way of generating large scale structure from inflation .",
    "the primordial density perturbation may instead originate from the vacuum fluctuation of some ` curvaton ' field @xmath4 , different from the inflaton field .",
    "the curvaton scenario has received a lot of attention @xcite because it opens up new possibilities both for model - building and for observation @xcite .    in the curvaton scenario ,",
    "the curvaton energy density is supposed to be initially negligible so that spacetime is practically unperturbed .",
    "it becomes significant only during some era of radiation domination , when the curvaton field is undergoing a ( hubble damped ) sinusoidal oscillation causing its energy density to grow relative to the radiation background .",

    "we study the evolution of the curvaton field in a very general way .",
    "we verify that the curvaton contribution to the energy density , if initially negligible , remains so until the ( hubble damped ) sinusoidal oscillation sets in , and we also show how to calculate the numbers @xmath8 and @xmath9 which enter into the prediction for the curvature perturbation .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section  [ setup ] , we lay out the stage for our study .",
    "in particular , we provide the basic equations for the background evolution of the universe and we briefly introduce the curvaton model with emphasis on how the curvaton imposes its perturbations onto the universe and on what the requirements for a successful curvaton are .",
    "also , in this section , we discuss and justify the choice of the form of the curvaton s effective potential . in section  [ durinf ] , we study the evolution of the curvaton during inflation and estimate the value of the field at the end of inflation as well as the amplitude of its perturbations at that time . in section  [ afterinf ] , we investigate the evolution of the curvaton field and its density ratio with respect to the background density after the end of inflation .",
    "we find analytic solutions in all cases considered , which describe both @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in section  [ curvdom ]",
    ", we employ the results of the previous section to calculate , in all cases considered , the time when the curvaton comes to dominate the universe or , if it decays earlier than this , the corresponding value of the density ratio @xmath8 at the time of decay .",
    "we also calculate in detail the value of @xmath9 , relating the curvaton s fractional perturbation at decay with its initial fractional perturbation , obtained in inflation . in section  [ tcorr ] , we study the effects of temperature corrections to the effective potential on the evolution of the curvaton and find upper bounds on the curvaton s coupling @xmath19 to the thermal bath , which prevent these effects from being destructive . in section  [ exam ] , we present a concrete model realization of our findings . assuming a realistic set of values for the inflationary parameters , we study the model in detail and , by enforcing all the constraints and requirements , we identify the parameter space for a successful curvaton .",
    "finally , in section  [ concl ] , we discuss our results and present our conclusions .    in this paper , we use units such that so that newton s gravitational constant is , where is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the dynamics of the universe expansion is determined by the friedmann equation , which , for a spatially flat universe , reads @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the density of the universe and with @xmath26 being the scale factor of the universe .",
    "the dynamics of a real , homogeneous scalar field @xmath4 in the expanding universe is determined by the klein - gordon equation of motion given in eq .",

    "( [ energy ] ) gives @xcite @xmath33 using this and eq .",
    "( [ fried ] ) , it is easy to find that , for , the hubble parameter and the density of the universe evolve in time as @xmath34 from which it is evident that . during inflation",
    "the universe is dominated by the potential density of another scalar field , the inflaton . according to this , eq .",
    "( [ rp ] ) suggests that the equation of state of the universe during inflation is , which , in view of eq .",
    "( [ raw ] ) , suggests that . hence ( c.f .",
    "( [ fried ] ) ) the hubble parameter remains roughly constant .",
    "the curvaton is a scalar field @xmath4 other than the inflaton that may be responsible for the curvature perturbation in the universe .",
    "one of the merits of considering such a field is the liberation of inflation model - building from the stringent requirements imposed by the observations of the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) .",
    "indeed , the curvaton model changes the cobe constraint on the energy scale of inflation @xmath35 into an upper bound @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the context of the curvaton model , one can achieve a remarkably flat superhorizon spectrum of curvature perturbations , which is in agreement with the recent data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite .",
    "finally , since the curvaton ( in contrast to the inflaton ) is not related to the universe dynamics during inflation it can be associated with much lower energy scales than the ones corresponding to inflation and , therefore , may be easily linked with lower energy ( e.g. tev ) physics .",
    "this is why physics beyond the standard model provides many candidates for the curvaton , such as sfermions , string axions , or even the radion of large extra dimensions .",
    "according to the curvaton scenario , the curvature perturbations , generated during inflation due to the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field , are _ not _ the ones which cause the observed cmbr anisotropy and seed the formation of large scale structure .",
    "this is because their contribution is rendered negligible compared to the curvature perturbations introduced by another scalar field , the curvaton . in a similar manner as with the inflaton ,",
    "the curvaton field receives an almost scale invariant , superhorizon spectrum of perturbations during inflation .",
    "however , at that time , the density of the curvaton field is subdominant , and the field lies frozen at some value displaced from the minimum of its potential . after the end of inflation ,",
    "the field eventually unfreezes and begins oscillating .",
    "while doing so , the density fraction of the curvaton to the overall energy density increases . as a result , before decaying ( or being thermalized ) the curvaton may come to dominate ( or nearly dominate ) the universe , thereby imposing its own curvature perturbation spectrum .",
    "after this , it decays into standard model particles , creating the thermal bath of the standard hot big bang .      on a foliage of spacetime corresponding to spatially flat hypersurfaces ,",
    "the curvature perturbation attributed to each of the universe components is given by @xcite @xmath36 then the total curvature perturbation @xmath37 , which also satisfies eq .",
    "( [ zetai ] ) , may be calculated as follows .",
    "using that and eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) , it is easy to find @xmath38 now , since in the curvaton scenario all contributions to the curvature perturbation other than the curvaton s are negligible , we find that @xmath39 where is the curvature perturbation observed by cobe , and @xmath40 is the curvature perturbation of the curvaton when the latter decays ( or thermalizes ) . from the above ,",
    "it is evident that ( c.f .",
    "( [ rdef ] ) ) @xmath41    the curvaton decays when , where @xmath42 with @xmath43 being the decay rate of the curvaton and @xmath44 the thermalization rate , corresponding to the thermal evaporation of the curvaton condensate .",
    "note that , after the curvaton decay , the total curvature perturbation remains constant , i.e. .",
    "suppose that the curvaton , just before decaying ( or being thermalized ) , is oscillating in a potential of the form , where is an even , positive number .",
    "then , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the density of the oscillating field scales as @xmath45 which means that . using this , eq .",
    "( [ zetai ] ) gives @xmath46 where we used that .",
    "note also that , using eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) for the oscillating curvaton , it is easy to show that @xmath47 thus , in the case of a quadratic potential , the oscillating scalar field behaves like pressureless matter , whereas for a quartic potential it behaves like radiation .",
    "for a ( hubble damped ) sinusoidal oscillation ( ) , the above give ( c.f .",
    "( [ spec ] ) ) .",
    "apart from providing the correct curvature perturbation , a successful curvaton needs to satisfy a number of additional requirements",
    ". these can be outlined as follows :    * * masslessness : * in order for the curvaton field to obtain a superhorizon spectrum of perturbations during inflation , at least on cosmological scales , the field needs to be effectively massless , when these scales exit the horizon .",
    "thus , at that time , we require that @xmath48 * * misalignment : * for the curvature perturbations due to the curvaton to be gaussian , it is necessary that , when the cosmological scales exit the horizon during inflation , the curvaton field is significantly displaced from the minimum of its potential .",
    "thus , we require that @xmath49 * * wmap : * according to the recent wmap observations , to avoid excessive non - gaussianity in the density perturbation spectrum , the curvaton needs to decay ( or thermalize ) when the density ratio @xmath8 of eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) is sufficiently large and satisfies the bound @xcite @xmath50 obviously , in order for the field not to be thermalized too soon after the end of inflation , we require that its coupling @xmath19 to the thermal bath , generated by the inflaton s decay , is small enough . * * nucleosynthesis : * due to the above wmap bound on @xmath8 , one has to demand that the curvaton should have decayed ( and not just be thermalized ) by the time when big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) takes place ( at temperature ) , which imposes the constraint @xmath51      the form of the perturbative scalar potential is @xcite @xmath52 where and @xmath21 is some large mass - scale ( e.g. @xmath53 ) determining when the non - renormalizable terms become important",
    ". we will consider that the sum is dominated by the term of the ( @xmath54)@xmath55th order .",
    "we will also take into account temperature corrections due to the possible coupling @xmath19 of the field with an existing thermal bath of temperature @xmath20 .",
    "finally , we will consider corrections to the scalar potential due to supergravity effects .",
    "these corrections introduce an effective mass , whose magnitude is determined by the hubble parameter @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "all in all , the form of our scalar potential is @xmath57 where @xcite .",
    "the masslessness requirement demands that , at least during inflation , .",
    "this may be due to some ( approximate ) symmetry or due to accidental cancellations of specific khler corrections , which means that it depends on the particular curvaton model @xcite .",
    "obviously , the masslessness requirement also demands during inflation .",
    "depending on the sign in front of @xmath58 , the above potential may have a global minimum or a local maximum at the origin . in the latter case and when ,",
    "the potential is characterized by global minima at @xmath59 such that @xmath60^{\\frac{1}{n+2 } } \\hspace{-.2cm}\\sim ( ch^2m^n)^{\\frac{1}{n+2}}\\ , , \\label{fmin}\\ ] ] where , in the last equation , we have absorbed @xmath61 ! into @xmath21 ( for ,",
    "we can set ) . in this case , in order to ensure that the potential remains positive we may add a constant @xcite .    if the local minimum is displaced from the origin then one can express the potential in terms of -_min , [ fhat ] in which case , for , the potential of eq .",
    "( [ v0 ] ) is recast as @xmath62 where . since the series is finite ,",
    "the above is an exact expression and not an approximation .",
    "it is evident that all the terms of the sum in eq .",
    "( [ linear ] ) are comparable to each - other when and the sum reduces to @xmath63 . for , however , the sum is dominated by the term of the largest order which is . obviously , when , only the quasi - quadratic ( ` quasi ' in the sense that ) term is important .",
    "thus , in all cases , the potential can be roughly approximated by @xmath64 where we considered that , when , then .    in the case of @xmath65 in eq .",
    "( [ v0 ] ) , and . in the @xmath66 case , but the complicated structure near the local maximum is felt only when the field is near . since we attempt a generic study of the behaviour of the field s dynamics , eq .  ( [ v ] ) will suffice for .",
    "it is true , however , that a different higher - order term may dominate for different values of the field .",
    "this is one of the reasons for treating @xmath67 as a free parameter here . in general",
    ", we expect that the order of the dominant higher  order term increases with @xmath4 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .    reinstating the @xmath68 coefficients",
    ", it is easy to see that the ratio of two higher  order terms of different orders is @xmath69 this means that , if all the @xmath68 s are of the same magnitude then , for , the sum of the higher  order terms in eq.([vpert ] ) will be dominated by the lowest order ( quartic term ) , while , for , it will be the highest order that dominates . since the sum is infinite , this means that @xmath70 blows up and the perturbative approximation is no longer valid . however , if the @xmath68 coefficients are not of the same magnitude , then it is possible that the sum of the higher  order terms is dominated by a single term , higher than the quartic , before blowing up .",
    "increasing @xmath4 may change the order of this term to an even higher one for given @xmath68 s as shown by eq .",
    "( [ ls ] ) .",
    "during inflation , our scalar field is expected to roll down its potential toward the minimum .",
    "this roll may be of three distinct types , depending on the initial conditions of the field or , more precisely , on where exactly the field lies originally in its potential .",
    "below , we briefly discuss these regimes assuming that , for all practical purposes , the hubble parameter during inflation is almost constant .",
    "we also assume , for simplicity , that the minimum of the potential lies at the origin ( if not one should simply set ) and consider the potential of eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) . without loss of generality",
    "we take .    *",
    "* the fast - roll regime : * the field is in this regime when it lies at a region of its potential such that . due to the masslessness requirement during inflation",
    ", we expect .",
    "thus , the field may be in the fast - roll regime only if it lies into the higher  order part of its potential .",
    "then it is easy to see that the border of the fast - roll regime corresponds to , where @xmath71 with .",
    "+ once in the fast - roll regime ( i.e. for ) , the field rapidly rolls until it reaches @xmath72 . after this , the motion of the field is no longer underdamped but feels instead the drag of the universe expansion .",
    "any kinetic energy assumed during the fast - roll will be depleted very fast after crossing @xmath72 as can be easily seen from eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) @xcite . * * the slow - roll regime : * this regime corresponds to .",
    "the field s motion is overdamped by the universe expansion and eq .",
    "( [ kg ] ) can be approximated as @xmath73 which is the familiar form of the inflaton s equation of motion in slow - roll inflation .",
    "* * the quantum regime : * classically , the field will continue to slow - roll until it reaches the minimum of its potential .",
    "however , an effectively massless scalar field during inflation undergoes particle production by generating superhorizon perturbations due to its quantum fluctuations . in that respect , _ the quantum fluctuations may affect the classical motion of the field if the generation of the perturbations becomes comparable to the slow - roll motion of the field_. let us elaborate a bit on this issue .",
    "+ in a region of fixed size @xmath74 ( horizon ) , the effect of the quantum fluctuations can be represented @xcite as a random walk with step given by the hawking temperature per hubble time .",
    "the slow - roll motion is comparable to this `` quantum kick '' when , or equivalently when , where @xmath75 is given by eq .",
    "( [ sr ] ) and @xmath76 is implicitly defined by the condition @xmath77 ( here @xmath4 corresponds to region of fixed size @xmath74 ) .",
    "one can understand the above also as follows .",
    "the energy density corresponding to the quantum fluctuations , which exit the horizon , is @xcite .",
    "the quantum regime begins when this energy density is comparable to the kinetic density of the slow - roll . comparing the two",
    ", one finds the same condition , eq .",
    "( [ qr ] ) , for the border of the quantum regime @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "+ after the onset of the quantum regime , the coherent motion of @xmath78 ceases . instead ,",
    "the field configuration spreads toward the origin by random walk . as a result",
    ", the mean value at horizon exit of the curvaton field in our universe ( denoted by @xmath78 ) may lie anywhere within the range , which means that , typically , its value would be .",
    "the same is true if the field finds itself already into the quantum regime at the onset of inflation .",
    "thus , from the above , we can sketch the typical evolution of the field during inflation . since the curvaton is expected to have negligible energy density when the cosmological scales exit the horizon during inflation",
    ", if we demand that initially , this means that the field must originally lie in the steep ( and curved ) part of its potential ( where it can not act as a curvaton ) and , therefore , it will engage into fast - roll . very soon",
    ", however , fast - roll sends the field below @xmath72 and the curvaton enters its slow - roll regime . whether it remains there until the end of inflation or not depends on the duration of the inflationary period . if inflation lasts long enough , the field will slow - roll down to @xmath76 , where it will be `` stabilized '' by the action of its quantum fluctuations .",
    "the quantum drift may further reduce @xmath78 somewhat but , since in the quantum regime the field is oblivious of the potential @xmath79 , there is no real motivation to drag it towards the origin . still ,",
    "can be selected anthropically , i.e. by assuming that we happen to live at a special place in the universe .",
    "the above enable us to speculate on the initial conditions of the curvaton after the end of inflation .",

    "however , if inflation ends before the field reaches the quantum regime , we have , where the subscript ` end ' denotes the end of inflation .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath80    using eq .",
    "( [ qr ] ) and also that for a perturbative potential , it is easy to see that @xmath81 since , in all cases , , we see that _ the misalignment requirement for the curvaton is naturally guaranteed by masslessness_.    let us estimate @xmath76 using eq .",

    "( [ zf ] ) , we see that .    consequently , in order to avoid the above catastrophe , we have to enforce the _ attractor constraint _ : @xmath119 i.e. we forbid the curvaton field to lie at the end of inflation deep enough in the higher  order part of its potential so that the attractor constraint is violated .",

    "if then there is a regime where something curious happens . indeed , for , the scalar potential is dominated by the quadratic term , for which , i.e. the field becomes overdamped and , consequently , freezes @xcite .",
    "this does not happen in the case where the field was oscillating before @xmath147 was reached , because in this case .",
    "however , it happens when the field is following the scaling solution in eq .",
    "( [ solu2 ] ) , according to which , until @xmath147 was reached , the field was rolling steadily towards the origin .",
    "after @xmath147 , this roll is halted .",
    "the important point to be stressed here is that , roughly when @xmath147 is reached , _ the field stops regardless of its value_. that is the whole configuration of @xmath4 freezes at the same moment and , therefore , _",

    "the reason is that , for , the effective mass is small and the field is overdamped . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath58 is comparable to unity both the quasi - quadratic oscillations and the scaling solution substantially diminish the density of the curvaton .",
    "in fact , it is possible that this suppression is so efficient that the final quadratic regime is unable to counteract it .",
    "hence , we have shown that _ the quasi - quadratic evolution disfavours curvatons which admit substantial supergravity corrections to their effective potential_. this strengthens the case of the curvaton being a pngb as discussed in ref .",

    "these perturbations effectively stabilize the coherent motion of the field for the remaining part of inflation .",
    "after inflation , we have studied the evolution of the curvaton s energy density in the cases when the effective mass is dominated by the quasi - quadratic term or a higher  order one . in the case of the quasi - quadratic domination",
    ", we have shown that there are two types of evolution depending on how suppressed is the effective mass .",
    "for effective mass of order the hubble parameter , we found that the field begins to oscillate , whereas , for suppressed mass , we have found a scaling solution , according to which the field rolls gently towards the minimum of its potential .",
    "both solutions preserve the amplitude of the perturbation spectrum of the curvaton , obtained during inflation .    in the case of the higher  order term domination ,",
    "we have shown again that the field , even though frozen initially , will , eventually , begin to oscillate ( preserving also the amplitude of the perturbation spectrum ) provided the order of the higher  order term is not too high .",
    "this is because , in the opposite case , after unfreezing , the field was found to follow an attractor solution , which loses all memory of initial conditions .",
    "consequently , were the field to follow such an attractor , all the superhorizon spectrum of its perturbations would have been erased and the field could not act as a curvaton .",
    "a similar situation was also found in the quasi - quadratic case , when the effective mass was negative after the end of inflation . in this case , if the order of the higher  order term ( which decides the temporal position of the minimum of the potential ) is too high , instead of rolling , the field was found to follow a particular solution and remain at fixed , constant ratio with respect to the temporal minimum , losing thereby all memory of initial conditions .",
    "the constraints obtained on the order of the principle higher  order term in both the above cases were comparable and their implementation was decisive for the evolution of the field .    generically , we have found the following behaviour for the curvaton after the end of inflation .",
    "both in the quasi - quadratic case and the higher  order case , the energy density of the field was found to be decreasing faster than the background density .",
    "consequently , curvaton domination ( or near domination ) is possible only after the effective mass of the field becomes dominated by the soft mass . in all cases , when the attractor was avoided ,",
    "we have found that the damping on the amplitude of the perturbation spectrum is negligible .",
    "finally , we have shown that the temperature corrections should not be allowed to dominate the effective mass of the field because if they do the field thermalizes before having a chance to dominate ( or nearly dominate ) .",
    "this requirement introduces a stringent constraint on the coupling of the curvaton to the thermal bath .    in all cases",
    ", we have calculated the density ratio @xmath8 of the curvaton to the background density of the universe at the time of the curvaton s decay .",
    "if the curvaton is to decay before dominating , this density ratio is necessary to determine the total curvature perturbation imposed by the curvaton field onto the universe .",
    "we have also calculated when the curvaton dominates , if it does indeed so , in all cases considered .",
    "furthermore , we calculated in detail the factor @xmath9 relating the curvaton perturbation at horizon crossing with the one at its decay .",
    "finally , we have employed our findings in a concrete model realization , for which we have shown that there is hardly any parameter space available for a successful curvaton if after the end of inflation , regardless of the sign in front of @xmath58 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for large values of @xmath58 , the density fraction of the curvaton is drastically reduced by either the quasi - quadratic oscillations or the scaling solution . as explained also in sec .",
    "[ qq1 ] , we expect this problem to be generic and , if so , this would favour models where @xmath58 after inflation remains strongly suppressed , such as the pngb curvaton models discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we should mention here that , due to the fact that our attempt to describing the curvaton evolution was aimed at the bulk of the parameter space , there are possibly special situations , not studied here , where the evolution may be significantly modified . for example , if the quasi - quadratic term is dominant but negative after the end of inflation and the field is undergoing oscillations , there will be a moment , just before the soft mass taking over , when the quadratic and quasi - quadratic terms cancel each - other . for a brief period , therefore , the field will be oscillating into a potential of higher order and , hence , will have an equation of state with a different ( larger ) effective barotropic parameter as shown by eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) .",
    "the outcome of all this will be a `` glitch '' to the scaling of the density ratio that may affect both the time of curvaton domination and/or the total curvature perturbation if the curvaton decays before domination .",
    "the importance of such an effect is possible to be studied only numerically .",
    "another example , in the case of negative quasi - quadratic mass , is the effect of the local maximum at the origin , which may be felt if the initial condition of the field is , which is exactly what we expect in this case , if the sign of @xmath58 changes at the end of inflation . indeed ,",
    "if the field engages into oscillations , there is a chance that , at some point , the oscillation amplitude marginally sends the field on top of the local maximum .",
    "the effect of such an event is the possible tachyonic amplification of the perturbation spectrum . in an analogous situation , this tachyonic amplification ( when the field ,",
    "as it oscillates , is temporarily stabilized near a local maximum of the potential ) was thoroughly investigated by us in an earlier paper @xcite , where it was found that the amplification of the perturbations could be substantial .",
    "one could even imagine that such an amplification mechanism may counteract the suppression of the amplitude of the perturbation spectrum due to attractor evolution .",
    "furthermore , we can imagine a number of modifications to our considerations arising due to a universe history more complicated than the one considered here .",
    "for example , one can insert a brief period of thermal inflation before or after curvaton domination .",
    "another example would be to consider a period of ` kination ' , for which the background density has a stiff equation of state , which arises naturally in models of quintessential inflation @xcite or non - oscillatory inflationary models @xcite .",
    "indeed , the curvaton is a convenient mechanism to increase the effective reheating efficiency of such models @xcite .",
    "we have not considered such possible complications in this paper mainly because there is an infinity of them . however , we tried to express our results in as much a model independent way as possible , so that they will be easy to implement in particular , more complicated scenarios of the universe history .",
    "all in all , we have investigated the evolution of the curvaton field during and after inflation .",
    "we have shown that a successful curvaton either oscillates or scales down to its minimum but always preserves the amplitude of the spectrum of its perturbations .",
    "we also showed that , in order to dominate ( or nearly dominate ) , the curvaton has to decay after its effective mass becomes dominated by the soft mass term and the oscillation becomes ( hubble damped ) sinusoidal .",
    "furthermore , to avoid premature thermalization , the temperature corrections to the curvaton s potential should remain negligible throughout all its evolution .",
    "finally , there is a part of the parameter space which results in destructive attractor evolution , which erases the perturbation spectrum and should be avoided .",
