    "the opto - mechanical oscillator ( omo ) generates spectrally pure radio frequency ( rf ) signals @xcite due to ponderomotive interaction between photons and phonons .",
    "phase noise and linewidth are the main characteristics detremining the performance of an oscillator and its practical usefulness .",
    "it was shown that the omo linewidth can be small enough to be ultimately described by a schawlow - townes - like formula @xcite . a leeson model @xcite of the phase noise far from the carrierfor a radiation pressure driven omo was presented in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we derive a generalized formula for the omo phase noise that takes into account the noise of the light pumping the resonator . using the formula ,",
    "we analyze allan deviation of the oscillator frequency as well as its linewidth . the predicted performance of the omo",
    "is then compared with the performance of existing electronic oscillators .",
    "opto - mechanical oscillation can be described as a strongly nondegenerate parametric process in which a pump photon is transformed to a photon of lower frequency ( stokes photon ) and a phonon @xcite .",
    "this occurs when the pump power exceeds a certain threshold determined by the loss of the system , and the coupling efficiency between the light and the mechanical modes . in the case of microcavity - based omo",
    ", the process is allowed if the resonator has at least two optical modes with frequency equal to the frequency of a mechanical mode .",
    "this condition satisfies energy conservation .",
    "the momentum conservation ( phase matching of the parametric interaction ) is met by the requirement of spatial overlap between the optical and the mechanical modes that ensure the convolution integral of the electric fields and the mechanical displacement , as well as mechanical strain , is nonzero @xcite .",
    "generally , the radiation by a laser is assumed to be phase insensitive .",
    "it means that the phase of the emitted light in a laser does not depend on the phase of the pump , and that there is no phase matching conditions ( preferred directionality ) in the system .",
    "an omo , even one based on brillouin lasing @xcite , has different properties .",
    "the mechanical quality factor is high enough to endow the generated phonons with some well defined phase .",
    "the phase of the stokes light emitted by the omo depends on the phonon phase , so the amplification of the stokes wave becomes phase sensitive and the phase fluctuations of the optical pump leak to the phase fluctuations of the stokes light . in what follows",
    "we develop a model for an omo and find the phase noise of the generated signal .",
    "it was shown that the linewidth of an omo increases if generation of an anti - stokes optical sideband is allowed by the system architecture @xcite . in this paper",
    "we analyze an ideal case where only two high quality ( q- ) factor optical modes and a single mechanical mode interact .",
    "the optical pump is resonant with higher frequency optical mode and the stokes optical sideband is generated in the lower frequency mode .",
    "the bandwidth of the optical modes is assumed to be much smaller than the mechanical frequency .",
    "this kind of interaction has been realized in oscillators based on stimulated brillouin scattering @xcite and surface acoustic waves @xcite .",
    "we write three coupled langevin equations for the modes and solve them analytically to evaluate the phase noise of the omo . to obtain a consistent result ,",
    "we take into account the phase noise of the laser used for pumping the omo .",
    "we show that one limitation of an omo is that the frequency stability of the mechanical mode is determined in the same way as the electronic quartz oscillators .",
    "the fluctuations of the thermal bath as well as the thermodynamic noise and drift of the mechanical mode limit the frequency stability .",
    "the pumping light is used as the power source in an omo , similar to the electric power source in electronic oscillators and , therefore , it is unlikely that the omo will outperform its electronic analogs , unless the frequency bandwidth of the optical modes is significantly smaller than the frequency bandwidth of the mechanical mode .",
    "an advantage of an omo , on the other hand , is in its potential long term stabilization via stability transfer from the optical frequency domain .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the equations are presented in section ii , and their solutions are described in section iii .",
