    "the temporal properties of grbs in the hard x - ray to soft gamma ray band ( 25 kev - 1000 kev ) which are important for our analysis can roughly be summarized as follows :    - the duration of bursts varies by five orders of magnitudes from a few milliseconds to a few hundred seconds and their time profiles are extremely diverse in their complexity and morphology ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    - all individual time profiles can probably be considered as a sum of a number of pulses of a more or less standard shape - a sharp rise and a slower exponential decay ( for morphologically simple events this is evident , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the width of these pulses differs by four orders of magnitude .",
    "- there are very complex events showing a wide range of time scales within a single burst .",
    "many short bursts or short features in long bursts look like rescaled versions of much longer events ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this could indicate multifractality of the time profiles of grbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the procedure for obtaining the average peak - aligned time profile of grbs was pioneered by mitrofanov et al .",
    "( 1994 , 1995 , 1996 ) ( also see norris et al . , 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "stern ( 1996 ) , studying the average peak - aligned time profile of grbs in the batse-2 catalog , found that the profile has a simple `` stretched '' exponential shape , @xmath0 $ ] , where @xmath1 is the time since the peak flux , @xmath2 , of the event , and @xmath3 is a constant ranging from 0.3 sec for strong bursts to @xmath4 1 sec for dim bursts .",
    "this dependence of @xmath3 on brightness could be interpreted as cosmological time dilation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here we only consider the average time profile of all grbs . in figure 1a",
    ", we present the average peak - aligned time profile of grbs , @xmath5 , ( thin - line histogram ) using the larger statistics of the batse-3 catalog .",
    "fitting @xmath6 $ ] where @xmath7 is an additional parameter , and excluding the first 64 ms bin ( likely to be contaminated by poisson noise ) gives @xmath8 at the 90 % confidence level .",
    "the average time profile does not show any statistically significant deviations from the stretched exponential for over almost 2.5 orders of magnitude in fractional flux , @xmath5 , and for three orders of magnitude in time ( from 0.1 s to 100 s ) .",
    "such a simple average time profile is remarkable considering the diverse and chaotic behavior of the individual time profiles of grbs .",
    "the stretched exponential law is known to describe some characteristics of scale invariant processes associated with fractals , e.g. , turbulence ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simple statistical behavior of grbs could mean that the diversity of all bursts is just due to different random realizations of the same simple stochastic process where the process is scale invariant in time .",
    "the stretched exponential time profile for grbs should not be interpreted as representing some average relaxation process in grbs , but rather to be a statistical effect reflecting the distributions of pulse widths and time lags between pulses . in this paper , we illustrate how the variety of grb time profiles can be reproduced using a simple toy model for a _ pulse avalanche _ , which behaves as a chain reaction in a near - critical regime .",
    "we also obtain satisfactory agreement with a number of the observed temporal statistical properties of grbs including the stretched exponential shape of the average time profile .",
    "previous attempts with , e.g. , shot noise models to model temporal properties have focused on only a few properties such as the power spectra of single bursts ( @xcite ) , or the average auto - correlation function ( @xcite ) . here",
    ", we attempt to interpret the recently discovered stretched exponential as well as several other temporal properties of grbs by suggesting the following hypothesis :    - all grbs can be described as different random realizations of the same simply organized stochastic process within narrow ranges of the parameters of the process .    - the stochastic process should be scale invariant in time .    - the stochastic process works near its critical regime .",
    "this would explain the large morphological diversity of grbs .",
    "we also suggest that one possible candidate for the underlying physical process responsible for the stochasticity is magnetohydrodynamic turbulence , where the standard pulses are due to magnetic reconnection events .",
    "it is difficult , if not impossible , because of the peak - aligning procedure to interpret the shape of the time profile using analytical methods .",
    "instead we use numerical methods to develop a simple stochastic toy model that have similar temporal properties as grbs .",
    "the model we propose is a _ pulse avalanche _ , which is a linear markov process having the following properties :    1 . )",
    "the elementary event is a pulse with a time constant ( @xmath9 pulse width ) @xmath10 and a standard shape being parameterized as a gaussian rise , @xmath11 $ ] for @xmath12 , and an exponential decay , @xmath13 $ ] for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the time for the peak of the pulse .",
    "fitting of observed pulses gives @xmath16 ( norris et al .",
    "we use @xmath17 .",
    "the pulse amplitude , @xmath18 , is sampled from a uniform distribution , @xmath19 , in the range [ 0 , 1 ] .    2 . ) in a pulse avalanche , each pulse acts as a parent pulse giving rise to a number of baby pulses , @xmath20 , sampled from a poisson distribution , @xmath21 , with the average number being @xmath22 .",
    "the process is close to its critical runaway regime when @xmath22 is of order unity .    3 .",
    ") a baby pulse is assumed to be delayed a time , @xmath23 , with respect to the parent pulse .",
    "we parameterize the probability distribution for the poisson delay as @xmath24 , where @xmath10 is the time constant of the baby pulse , and @xmath25 is the delay parameter .    4 . ) how is the time constant of a baby pulse , @xmath10 , related to the time constant , @xmath26 , of the parent pulse ?",
    "studying individual time profiles we arrive at the intuitive conclusion that @xmath10 and @xmath26 are of the same order of magnitude and that @xmath27 on average .",
    "this allows the process to converge even if @xmath22 exceeds 1 as the pulse avalanche eventually reaches an arbitrary short time scale , where a natural frequency cutoff should exist .",
    "we parameterize the probability distribution of @xmath28 as uniform , @xmath29=\\mid \\delta_2 -\\delta_1 \\mid^{-1}$ ] , in the range [ @xmath30 , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .    5 .",
    ") the process terminates when it converges due to subcritical values of the model parameters .    6 . ) the start of the pulse avalanche must also be described .",
    "we allow for the existence of a number , @xmath34 , of spontaneous primary pulses , sampled from a poisson distribution , @xmath35 , with the average number of spontaneous pulses per grb being @xmath36 .    7 . )",
    "we suggest that the probability distribution of the time constants , @xmath37 , of spontaneous pulses is @xmath38 . this corresponds to flicker noise , i.e. a `` @xmath39 '' spectrum , which is surprisingly wide spread in very different classes of phenomena ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations imply an upper cutoff , @xmath40 , for @xmath37 .",
    "we then sample @xmath41 uniformly between @xmath42 and @xmath40 , i.e. @xmath43 , where @xmath42 should be smaller than the time resolution .",
    "varying @xmath40 simply rescales all average avalanche properties in time , in this sense , @xmath40 is a trivial parameter .",
    "the spontaneous primary pulses in a given grb are all assumed to be delayed with different time intervals , @xmath1 , with respect to a common invisible trigger event .",
    "we parameterize the probability distribution for the poisson delay , @xmath1 , of a given spontaneous pulse as @xmath44 , where @xmath25 is the constant delay parameter used for all pulses ( see property 3 above ) and @xmath37 is the time constant of the spontaneous pulse .",
    "each spontaneous pulse gives rise to a pulse avalanche , and it is the overlap of @xmath34 pulse avalanches that form a grb .",
    "( alternatively , we could have chosen the spontaneous pulses to appear more or less uniformly over a wider time range that characterizes the evolution time scale of the pulse generating object .",
    "the difference between the scenarios appears when the number of spontaneous pulses exceeds unity . )",
    "the number of model parameters is seven .",
    "we found , however , that it is comparatively easy to understand the effects of moving around in parameter space .",
    "first , we show how the model works for a certain set of parameters , that was chosen without any serious efforts of optimization : @xmath45 ( chosen by visually examining when model bursts show sufficient complexity ) , @xmath46 ( gives the wanted shape of the average time profile ) , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( somewhat arbitrary ) , @xmath49 ( arbitrary but reasonable ) , @xmath50 ms ( below the time resolution , 64 ms ) , @xmath51 s ( by finding agreement with the experimental value , @xmath52 s , see fig .",
    "figure 1a tests the shape of the average peak - aligned time profile of the model .",
    "the deviations over long time intervals between real and simulated profiles does not exceed 1.5 @xmath53 and are typically within 1@xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is the rms statistical error of the real average time profile for 598 useful batse-3 events and where the rms deviation @xmath55 is shown in fig 1a ) .",
    "this indicates that the two profiles are statistically consistent ( an exact quantitative test for statistical consistency is very difficult due to complicated correlations between different parts of the profile ) .",
    "an excellent stretched exponential shape is obtained for @xmath25 between 3 and 6 and the dependence on other parameters is weak . outside this interval of @xmath25 ,",
    "the stretched exponential shape breaks at the level , @xmath56 , which would contradict the data .",
    "thus the long stretched exponential behavior is not an intrinsic property of the model , but is achieved for a certain range of the delay parameter @xmath25 .",
    "the observed time constant , @xmath52 s , of the average time profile seems to be related to the geometric mean 0.72 s of @xmath40 and @xmath42    after the average time profile is fitted by varying only two parameters , @xmath25 and @xmath40 , we automatically obtain agreement with observed data using a number of other characteristics :     the root mean square deviations of individual profiles ( fig",
    "the agreement means that the model not only correctly reproduces the average time profile shape but also the fluctuations of individual profiles .    ",

    " the average auto - correlation function ( acf ) , ( fig .",
    "the 2  10 s excess of the real acf over the simulated acf is statistically significant ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the deviation is moderate ( @xmath4 13% ) , however , and thus the test is reasonably successful .     the duration distribution ( fig .",
    "1d ) . here",
    "we claim only approximate agreement as discussed in the figure caption .    in figure 2 ,",
    "four observed time profiles are compared with simulated time profiles of similar complexity and morphology .",
    "counterparts for each real event were sampled from 300 simulated events using a _ single _ set of model parameters fixed to the values given above .",
    "the exception is the counterpart for the most erratic event in the batse-3 sample ( fig .",
    "2d ) where one parameter was changed slightly : the criticality was increased by setting @xmath58= 0.2 instead of 0 .",
    "a visual examination of burst profiles shows that the model is reasonably successful . for a more quantitative comparison",
    ", we selected the 325 brightest batse-3 bursts and simulated the same number of events using the set of parameter values given above . in order to eliminate brightness selection effects , we wanted the amplitude and background distributions of real and simulated events to be the same .",
    "each simulated event , therefore , had a peak and a background count rate of the @xmath59-th real event , where @xmath59 is a random number , @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , we imposed poisson noise at the 64 ms time resolution .",
    "then we made a simple visual morphological classification of both real and simulated bursts using the same criteria .",
    "we found 104 real and 91 simulated _ single peaked _",
    "events , 43 and 44 _ double peaked _ events , 84 and 81 _ moderately complex _",
    "events , 94 and 109 _ erratic _ events . repeating the same test for @xmath61 instead of",
    "@xmath62 gave 112 , 46 , 79 and 88 simulated events in each class , respectively .",
    "keeping in mind that visual classification is very subjective , especially between moderately complex and erratic events , we note that both results are statistically consistent with the distribution of real bursts .",
    "we also note that the actual number of simulated pulses in a grb often exceeds the visually estimated number .",
    "we still have a number of parameters to use for fine - tuning the model , but obtaining the best fit is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "we just present support for the hypothesis formulated above by using a simple model to demonstrate that a number of temporal properties of grbs have a natural interpretation in this approach .",
    "we can not and do not claim that we have found the only possible model that satisfy the data , but it is probably the simplest possible one .",
    "such basic features as a @xmath39 spectrum , time lag between pulses as described by property 3 ) in ",
    "[ sec : model ] , and time scaling invariance should probably be present in any model .",
    "the model we present is a version of a chain reaction in a near - critical ( slightly subcritical ) regime which then naturally provides large fluctuations .",
    "one other feature  the @xmath39 spectrum of spontaneous pulses  could also be associated with the near - criticality of the system .",
    "this near - criticality could be related to the concept of self - organized criticality that was introduced by bak , tang , & wiesenfeld ( 1987 ) in order to explain the widespread occurrence of @xmath39 noise .",
    "we now discuss the model in terms of the possible underlying physical process .",
    "we suggest reconnecting magnetic turbulence as a possible underlying mechanism .",
    "magnetic reconnection can generate abrupt releases of huge amounts of energy into hard x - rays or soft gamma rays .",
    "this is the case for solar flares and probably also for agns ( @xcite ) .",
    "turbulence is a phenomenon showing spatial and temporal scaling invariance , with the larger scales cascading to smaller scales just as required in our model .",
    "consider the following illustrative example for a possible scenario for grbs which incorporates the pulse avalanche .",
    "the original trigger event could be the coalescence of two neutron stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) or a catastrophic energy release by a neutron star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the trigger event itself can be invisible in the batse range on the dynamical time scale of the event ( @xcite ) .",
    "almost all released energy goes into the kinetic energy of the expanding fireball ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "then , at some stage , instabilities develop in the fireball due to interactions with the interstellar medium ( e.g. , @xcite ) or due to collisions of blast waves ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "instabilities could lead to the conversion of fireball energy into turbulent magnetic fields and eventually to dissipation through magnetic reconnection .",
    "the active turbulent phase can last for more than one hundred seconds , but if the probability of spontaneous reconnection is not large ( @xmath63 ) , we may see nothing ( zero primary pulses ) , or just one single pulse ( the chain is interrupted after the first pulse ) , or a developed complex avalanche  it all depends on chance .",
    "the rest of the fireball energy ( probably the major part ) dissipates in other directions or on longer time scales and in other energy ranges and is not yet detected .",
    "the scenario described above is just an illustration and for this reason we did not check whether it satisfies necessary temporal and energy requirements .",
    "it is , however , probable that the concept of a chain reaction can be built into a number of different scenarios .",
    "there exist more than one hundred models of grbs ( @xcite ) .",
    "we are not suggesting a new model but rather a new approach to the interpretation of the temporal properties of grbs , an approach that seems very fruitful and already extends our understanding of time profiles of grbs .",
