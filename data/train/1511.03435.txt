    "cartan was the first who asked the question : `` why should matter produce only curvature ? '' as a possible answer the einstein - cartan theory @xcite has been formulated in which the christoffel connection is replaced by a more general connection including both curvature and torsion .",

    "we relate a quantitative evaluation of this phenomenon to the relative change of length of a laser interferometer gw detectors arms in presence of gw produced by a binary system .",

    "the ellipse has semi - axes of the lengths @xmath263 and @xmath264 , which are rotated by an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the @xmath265-axis .",
    "+ the simplest gravitational wave detector one can imagine , is a body mass @xmath266 at a distance @xmath132 from a fiducial laboratory point , connected to it by a spring of resonant frequency @xmath267 and quality factor @xmath268 .",
    "einstein equation of geodesic deviation predicts that the infinitesimal displacement @xmath269 of the mass along the line of separation from the equilibrium position satisfies in the free falling frame of the observer at the fiducial laboratory frame and for wavelengths @xmath270 @xcite @xmath271 where @xmath272 and @xmath273 are are coefficients of order unity related to the detector response @xmath274 to a gravitational wave signal @xcite @xmath275 where @xmath276 f_{\\times}&=\\frac{1}{2}(1+\\cos^2\\theta)\\cos2\\phi\\hskip1mm\\sin2\\psi+\\cos\\theta\\hskip1mm\\sin2\\phi\\hskip1mm\\cos2\\psi\\hskip1mm,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath277 , @xmath278 , @xmath279 being the angles defining the relative orientation of the binary with respect to the detector . + laser - interferometer gravitational wave detectors are composed of two perpendicular km - scale arm cavities with two test - mass mirrors hung by wires at the end of each cavity .",
    "the tiny displacement @xmath269 of the mirrors induced by a passing gravitational wave are monitored with very high accuracy by measuring the relative optical phase between the light paths in each interferometer arm .",
    "the mirrors are pendula with quality factor @xmath268 and resonant frequency @xmath267 .",
    "thus , the equation ( [ motion ] ) written in fourier domain , reduces to @xmath280 in the specific positions we have considered the binary as the source of gw namely , the binary in the @xmath281-direction and the arms of the detector in the @xmath282-plane , then @xmath283 @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath284 and @xmath285 which are of order unity , take alternatively the values 0 and 1 on such a way that when one takes the value 0 , the other one take the value 1 .",
    "now , using ( [ h ] ) and taking into account the expressions of @xmath167 and @xmath286 ( [ eq34 ] ) , the relation ( [ almostfinal ] ) can be written @xmath287 which is exactly the expression obtained ( [ final ] ) in section 7 .",
    "from the standard gr point of view , the existence of gw is intuitively obvious as soon as the space - time is assumed to act as an elastic medium .",
    "the basic properties of gw can then be deduced from the space curvature as a consequence of mass distribution in space and in time .",
    "+ since the pioneering work of joseph weber @xcite , the improvement of detectors has been remarkable .",
    "relating them to optical telescopes , the improvement achievement so far is equivalent to the step from a 3 cm diameter optical telescope to a 3 m diameter instrument . in the next decade",
    "it is hoped that the improvement will be equivalent to a step up in size from 3 m to 3 km @xcite . at this sensitivity gravitational wave detection",
    "is practically certain , and the field of gravitational astronomy will be able to map and explore the new spectrum , and the objects that it reveals .",
    "+ in this sens , identifying the correct theory of gravity is a crucial issue for modern physics .",
    "also , modifications of gravity are required to deal with the vast phenomenological results .",
    "but the ambiguity comes from the fact that very often , these results can be explained successfully both with the standard gr or modified and extended gr .",
    "here we have a blatant example of this situation .",
    "+ in this article , we have adopted an alternative approach to the standard gr by taking into account both curvature and torsion .",
    "including torsion , does not modify the standard approach of gr but bring us out of the riemann space . in this context , considering a laser interferometer gw detector , we have highlighted the meaning of the breaking of the parallelogram in presence of torsion and , we have shown that the delay time observed in this type of experiments can be interpreted by this approach . through this delay time , we obtain the usual parameter @xmath185 which is the relative change of length of the arms of the laser interferometer detector in presence of gw . by considering two specific positions of a typical binary system as the source of gw , namely the ns - ns binary pulsar ( 1913 + 16 ) , we obtain @xmath288 in one position corresponding to a mixture of @xmath237 and @xmath238 polarizations and @xmath289 in the other position corresponding to pure @xmath238 polarization .",
    "+ it is remarkable that in comparison with the standard gr , not only the numerical results but also the analytical expression , at first order , are exactly the same . + to go further",
    ", it will be useful to compare these results with those obtained in the context of higher orders gravity .",
    "also , to round off this comparison , it will be necessary to calculate these quantities , adopting the teleparallel theory of gravity .",
