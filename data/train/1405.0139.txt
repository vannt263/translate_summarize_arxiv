    "this naturally leads to a form of second order @xmath0 which was used by starobinsky @xcite to address the issue of inflation .",
    "in essence @xmath0 theory enters our cosmological model in the same way as in starobinsky s model of inflation but unlike starobinsky s model where the modified gravity theory produces inflation in a universe devoid of matter , in our case the modified theory of gravity will ensure a non singular cosmological bounce in presence or absence of hydrodynamic matter . as in @xmath0 theories of gravity the equations of motion of",
    "the metric involves higher order partial derivatives of the metric ( compared to the second order theories in gr ) we will often call @xmath0 theories of gravity as higher derivative ( hd ) theories of gravity . in these hd theories of gravity",

    "our method relies on the description of the bouncing phenomenon in a conformally related einstein frame .",
    "although the relations connecting the conformal frame , where an hd theory of gravity lives , and that of a conformally related einstein frame were well studied for the case of starobinsky inflation @xcite , the present analysis of the bouncing phenomena in the two frames requires a complete new way of interpreting the physics of cosmological evolution .",
    "this is because unlike the case of starobinsky inflation here the conformally related frames will not portray the same bouncing phenomenon when the spatial curvature of the frw spacetime vanishes . in this particular case",

    "the einstein frame description of cosmological bounces , in presence of matter , requires a scalar field whose potential may not be bounded from below and a hydrodynamic fluid whose energy density and pressure is modulated by the scalar field strength .",
    "but these facts do not deter one from describing the bouncing phenomenon in the einstein frame as because in the time period where the hd theory is supposed to be active the scalar field can not roll down to its negative infinite potential depth . in our analysis of the bouncing phenomena in hd theories",
    "we will assume that the hydrodynamic matter ( if present ) will satisfy the weak energy conditions ( wec ) at all times .",

    "can be predicted from the values of the scalar field and its first derivative with respect to the time variable in the einstein frame at the time of bounce .",

    "the pattern of time evolution of the perturbation potentials for the dust induced bounce is similar to the radiation induced bounce except a couple of points .",
    "we had commented earlier that for a matter induced bounce the perturbation evolution equation in the einstein frame becomes more like a first order differential equation in @xmath206 . for the sake of the quantum mechanical initial conditions it was assumed that for dust matter perturbations it is safe to take @xmath237 ( where @xmath282 ) and consequently in our plots we have always assumed @xmath283 . in such cases",
    "it can be show that the effect of the second derivative of @xmath206 with respect to the conformal time in eq .",

    "interestingly in the present case it appears that @xmath253 is continuous in all the cases .",
    "actually @xmath253 also has discontinuities at points where @xmath254 but the amplitude of the discontinuity is much less than the value of @xmath253 and consequently the discontinuities remain hidden .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction of this article there are several papers on cosmological bounce in the framework of gr and some on hd gravity as well . in the works with hd gravity ,",
    "mainly the bouncing conditions with various forms of @xmath0 were discussed .",
    "a thorough analysis of the whole bouncing mechanism in @xmath0 theories did not come into sight of the present authors .",
    "more over the previous works on cosmological bounce in @xmath0 theories were done in the jordan frame itself where interpretation of the dynamics becomes too complicated because of the hd terms involving the ricci scalar @xmath10 . in the present article",
    "our attempt has been to understand the bouncing cosmologies in @xmath0 theories by studying the corresponding cosmological behavior in the einstein frame where the theory of gravity is guided by general relativity .",
    "although this prescription is not foolproof as the corresponding theory in the einstein frame can come with a scalar field whose potential is not bounded from below , but still one can safely use the einstein frame description of the bouncing phenomenon because before the scalar field starts to role over to the infinite negative depth of the potential the hd theory of gravity itself becomes ineffective .    in this article we started with the general bouncing conditions in the jordan frame and",
    "then focussed on frw spacetimes which have flat spatial hypersurfaces . a very general proof of the sufficient conditions for the possibility of cosmological bounces , in the absence of any hydrodynamic matter , in such kind of spacetimes is presented in subsection [ mlb ] . in this article",
    "we have worked out the full einstein frame formulation of the cosmological bounce .",
    "the jordan frame and einstein frame relationships for @xmath0 theories for inflationary cosmologies were known for a long time .",
    "but the present case is different because unlike inflationary cosmology , where there is an accelerated expansion of the universe in both the conformally connected frames , here the two frames may show completely different behaviors .",
    "we have always assumed that the physical frame is the jordan frame and so this divergent behaviors do not pose a paradoxical result .    specifically , the present article deals with the issue of studying bouncing cosmologies in quadratic @xmath0 theory of gravity where the background frw line element has zero spatial curvature .",
    "the bounces in these cosmologies are interesting because the description of the bouncing phenomena is very different in the jordan frame and the einstein frame",
    ". if there are cosmological bounces in the jordan frame there can not be any analogous bounce in the einstein frame as shown in subsection [ abef ] . in the einstein frame",
    "the bouncing regime corresponds to an expanding phase followed by a contracting phase .",
    "the change over time from an expanding to a contracting phase depends on the values of the scalar field and its first derivative with respect to the time variable in the einstein frame .",
    "whereas for a frw spacetime with non flat spatial hypersurface one may get simultaneous bounces in both the conformally related frames only when the curvature of the spatial hypersurface of the frw spacetime is positive . in this article",
    "we have worked out the explicit nature of the bounces for an universe filled with radiation . from the dynamics of the system in the einstein frame we could predict about the symmetries of the bouncing phenomenon .",
    "the other important issue discussed in this article is related to the theory of cosmological perturbations in the bouncing universe whose dynamics is guided by a @xmath0 theory of gravity in the jordan frame . in this article we have only worked with the scalar sector of the perturbations . like the background analysis in this case also we first write down the perturbation equations in the einstein frame , where the analysis becomes relatively simple because the two bardeen potentials are identical . in this article",
    "we derive the main evolution equation for the bardeen potential in the einstein frame where the background cosmological evolution takes place in presence of a hydrodynamic fluid and a scalar field .",
    "we have assumed that there is only one barotropic fluid in the jordan frame such that the hydrodynamic perturbations in both the conformally related frames remain adiabatic .",
    "the main equation specifying the evolution of the perturbations in the einstein frame is interesting because from its structure one can see that both the second order time derivative and the laplacian of the bardeen potential is multiplied by the square of the speed of sound .",
    "consequently , if the cosmological bounce occurs in presence of dust then the evolution of the perturbation equations turn out to be a first order differential equation in conformal time .",
    "the main evolution equation of the perturbations reduces to a previously well known evolution equation of the bardeen potential in the absence of any hydrodynamic fluid . the only difficulty with the present method is related to the fact that the einstein frame evolution of the perturbation may not give the complete evolution of the jordan frame perturbation evolution as the jordan frame potentials may diverge at one instant of time during the bounce .",
    "it was shown that this is an artefact of the transformation relations which connect the scalar perturbation potentials in the two conformal frames .",
    "this difficulty does not limit the scope of einstein frame calculation , of the perturbations , as the divergence of the jordan frame perturbations is purely a local phenomenon happening at an instant of time and the jordan frame potentials are well behaved throughout the bouncing regime except at that particular time instant .",
    "the way @xmath222 appears in eq .",
    "( [ mpeqn ] ) is in general different from the way it appears in conventional evolution equation of the bardeen potential in the presence of hydrodynamic matter , where @xmath222 only multiplies the laplacian operator acting on the bardeen potential and there is no @xmath222 factor before the second order time derivative of the potential .",
    "but it can be verified from the form of eq .",
    "( [ mpeqn ] ) that precisely the positions of the square of the sound velocity there makes the evolution equation correspond to the well known evolution equation of the bardeen potential in absence of hydrodynamic matter and in the presence of a scalar field , as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , in appropriate limits .    in this article",
    "we did not get the scope to discuss the very important issue of tensor perturbations in the bouncing universe model with @xmath0 gravity .",
    "we presented a numerical solution for the scalar perturbations @xmath252 and @xmath253 in the last section which shows that the perturbations remain practically constant during the bouncing period .",
    "the topic of tensor perturbations and quantization of the spacetime fluctuations will be addressed in a future publication .",

    "<S> the present work analyzes the various conditions in which there can be a bouncing universe solution in @xmath0 gravity . in the article an interesting method , to analyze the bouncing frw solutions in a spatially flat universe using @xmath0 gravity models using an effective einstein frame description of the process , </S>",
    "<S> is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis shows that a cosmological bounce in the @xmath0 theory need not be described by an equivalent bounce in the einstein frame description of the process where actually there may be no bounce at all . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the einstein frame description of the bouncing phenomena turns out to be immensely important as the dynamics of the bounce becomes amenable to logic based on general relativistic intuition . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of scalar cosmological perturbations in the bouncing universe models in @xmath0 theories has also been worked out in the einstein frame . </S>"
