    "our emphasis is on applying a model ",
    "independent approach tightly constrained by the symmetries of the standard model to determine the axial structure of the nucleon in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "in this section , we will give a brief review of published data on the axial and induced pseudoscalar form factors .",
    "the methods which lead to these results will be presented and critically discussed in the following sections . at this point",
    ", we only wish to point out that systematical errors for certain processes have certainly been underestimated , but here we simply collect the data as they are available .",
    "there are two methods to determine the axial form factor of the nucleon , namely ( anti)neutrino scattering off protons or nuclei and charged pion electroproduction .",
    "we consider first the experimental data coming from measurements of ( quasi)elastic ( anti)neutrino scattering off protons @xcite , off deuterons @xcite-@xcite and other nuclei ( al , fe ) @xcite or composite targets like freon @xcite-@xcite and propane @xcite . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : axmass ]",
    "we show the available values for the axial mass @xmath22 obtained from neutrino scattering experiments .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , references  @xcite reported severe uncertainties in either knowledge of the incident neutrino flux or reliability of the theoretical input needed to subtract the background from genuine elastic events ( both of which gradually improved in subsequent experiments ) .",
    "the values derived in these papers fall well outside the most probable range of values known today and exhibit very large statistical and systematical errors . following the data selection criteria of the particle data group @xcite , they were excluded from this compilation . in all cases ,",
    "the axial form factor data were parameterized in terms of a dipole , the resulting world average is @xmath29 the other determinations of the axial form factor are based on the analysis of charged pion electroproduction off protons , see references  @xcite@xcite-@xcite , slightly above the pion production threshold ( note that the mami measurement is presently extended  @xcite to lower momentum transfer and to check the cross section at the highest @xmath30 point reported in @xcite ) .",
    "such type of analysis is more involved .",
    "it starts from the low  energy theorem of nambu , luri and shrauner @xcite for the electric dipole amplitude @xmath31 at threshold , valid for soft pions , i.e. pions with vanishing four  momentum .",
    "dependent corrections ( so  called hard pion corrections ) were developed to connect the low - energy theorem to the data , that is to the real world with a finite pion mass , see references  @xcite-@xcite , labeled sp , fpv , dr and bnr , respectively . for a given model , the values of the axial mass were determined from the slopes of the angle  integrated differential electroproduction cross sections at threshold .",
    "the results of various measurements and theoretical approaches are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : axmass ] .",
    "note again that references @xcite were omitted from the fit for lack of reasonable compatibility with the other results .    in figure  [ alldata ]",
    "we have collected the various electroproduction data , in comparison to a dipole fit with @xmath32gev .",
    "again , at various values of the momentum transfer one sees two or three data points , these show the model  dependence due to the applied hard pions corrections .",
    "the resulting world average of the dipole masses collected in figure  [ fig : axmass ] is @xmath33 although some of these results have large uncertainties , the weighted average for the axial mass determinations from neutrino scattering and pion electroproduction are quite precise .",
    "in particular , we notice an _ axial mass discrepancy _ , i.e. the so determined axial masses differ significantly , @xmath34 which translates into an axial radius difference of about 5% , i.e. the axial radius of the nucleon determined from neutrino scattering data appears bigger than the one from electroproduction , @xmath35fm versus @xmath36fm , the _ axial radius discrepancy _ to be discussed in section  [ sec : ax ] .",
    "_ ordinary muon capture _ ( omc ) , @xmath37 where we have indicated the four  momenta of the various particles , allows to measure the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant , @xmath25 .",
    "most experiments so far have used liquid hydrogen targets , which leads to atomic physics complications because the @xmath38p atom rapidly forms an p@xmath38p orthomolecule .",
    "consequently , one has to know the transition rate from the ortho to the para ground state .",
    "furthermore , there can be mixing between @xmath39 and @xmath40 components of the ortho p@xmath38p state @xcite . to facilitate the discussion ,",
    "the various atomic and molecular states are shown in figure  [ fig : omc ] together with the pertinent transition rates ( as determined experimentally ) .",
    "the world data on electronics experiments for muon capture in hydrogen @xcite-@xcite are collected in figure  [ fig : gpdat ] , these values have been rescaled to the present day values of the axial ",
    "vector coupling constant , the fermi constant and the cabbibo angle .",
    "the weighted world average is @xmath41 which is in good agreement with theoretical expectations as discussed below .    at this point",
    "it is worth to emphasize that the experimental value for the ortho  para transition rate @xmath42s@xmath43  @xcite is used to arrive at the world average .",
    "this value disagrees , however , with the theoretical expectation of reference  @xcite , @xmath44s@xmath43 .",
    "we also point out that the theoretical formula for the liquid capture rate  la @xcite involves a time integration from zero to infinity while in the measurement only a finite time interval is considered , thus a direct comparison is dangerous .",
    "a similar observation has recently been made in reference  @xcite .",
    "stated differently , the theory has to adopt to the experimental circumstances .",
    "we would like to stress here the importance of the new proposed experiment at psi @xcite which will be done with a hydrogen gas target and will thus be independent of possible molecular complications because one will directly measure the atomic singlet rate",
    ". this experiment attempts to measure @xmath25 to one percent accuracy , which would be a significant improvement compared to the present situation .",
    "these topics will be taken up again in section  [ sec : gp ] .",
    "the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant has also been determined by muon capture on various nuclei , from light to heavy ones .",
    "a comprehensive review has been given in @xcite , here we only report results for some light nuclei in table  [ tab : gp ] .",
    "note that these determinations are mostly in agreement with the theoretical expectations , but the spread in the results is larger than given in the table  @xcite . in heavier nuclei ,",
    "there has been much discussion about a possible quenching of @xmath25 ( similar to the quenching of @xmath15 ) , but the situation can not be considered settled .",
    "we do not pursue this topic here , but refer to the recent reference  @xcite .",
    "@lcc nucleus & @xmath25 & reference + @xmath45he ( capture to triton ) & @xmath46 & @xcite + @xmath47c ( capture to ground state ) & @xmath48 & @xcite + @xmath49o ( capture to @xmath49n(0@xmath50 ) ) & @xmath51 & @xcite @xcite +    while the momentum transfer in omc is fixed , _ radiative muon capture _ ( rmc ) , @xmath52 has a variable momentum transfer @xmath53 and one can get up to @xmath54 at the maximum photon energy of about @xmath55mev , which is quite close to the pion pole .",
    "this amounts approximately to a four times larger sensitivity to @xmath25 in rmc than omc .",
    "however , this increased sensitivity is upset by the very small partial branching ratio in hydrogen @xmath56 for photons with @xmath57mev ) and one thus has to deal with large backgrounds .",
    "precisely for this reason only very recently a first measurement of rmc on the proton has been published  @xcite . the resulting number for @xmath25 , which was obtained using a relativistic tree model including the @xmath58isobar  @xcite to fit the measured photon spectrum , came out significantly larger than expected from omc , @xmath59 and thus also about 40% above all theoretical expectations ( see section  [ sec : gp ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that in this model the momentum dependence in @xmath60 is solely given in terms of the pion pole and the induced pseudoscalar coupling is obtained as a multiplicative factor from direct comparison to the photon spectrum and the partial rmc branching ratio ( for photon energies larger than 60 mev ) .",
    "we will critically examine this procedure in section  [ sec : triumf ] .",
    "it was also argued in  @xcite that the atomic and molecular physics related to the binding of the muon in singlet and triplet atomic @xmath61 and ortho and para @xmath62 molecular states is sufficiently well under control ( which is under debate , see section  [ sec : omc ] ) .",
    "this result spurred a lot of theoretical activity , as discussed later , but here we only wish to point that it is a viable possibility that the discrepancy does not come from the strong interactions but rather is related to the distribution of the various spin states of the muonic atoms .",
    "it is therefore mandatory to sharpen the theoretical predictions for the strong as well as the non ",
    "strong physics entering the experimental analysis . in principle , @xmath12 can also be measured in pion electroproduction , because it enters the longitudinal cross section ( in parallel kinematics ) together with many other effects ( see the discussion in section  [ sec : pion ] ) .",
    "however , the leading dependence due to the pion pole ( and its chiral corrections ) is unique and can be tested .",
    "so far there has only been one experiment  @xcite that took up the challenge , with the results shown in figure  [ fig : gptdata ] .",
    "the observed momentum dependence agrees with theoretical expectations , but a more refined measurement is certainly called for . in fact , at the mainz microtron mami - b a dedicated experiment has been proposed to measure the induced pseudoscalar form factor by means of charged pion electroproduction at low momentum transfer  @xcite . at this point , it is important to stress that in the low  energy region , @xmath12 is not truly independent from @xmath11 , as discussed in detail in section  [ sec : gp ] .",
    "we conclude that the induced pseudoscalar form factor is the least well known of all six electroweak nucleon form factors .",
    "neutral and charged current ( anti)neutrino scattering off protons or light nuclei can be used to extract the axial form factor . since these topics are well documented in the literature @xcite , we only give some basic formulae ( sometimes in a highly symbolic notation ) .",
    "the starting point is the effective lagrangian of the electroweak standard model for elastic neutrino  hadron scattering , such as @xmath63 , or quasi ",
    "elastic scattering , such as @xmath64 reactions ( and similarly for anti - neutrinos ) , @xmath65 with @xmath66 the neutrino / lepton in the final state .",
    "we are interested here in the hadronic current @xmath67 which can be written as @xmath68 where the up and down  quark contributions are combined to form the isoscalar and isovector vector ( @xmath69 and axial  vector currents ( @xmath70 . the ellipses represent heavy quark ( @xmath71 ) terms . in the standard model ,",
    "one has at tree level @xmath72 with @xmath73 the ( weak ) mixing angle .",
    "it describes the strength of the mixing of the electromagnetic current with the neutral weak current and thus only appears in the vector currents .",
    "assuming now time reversal invariance , isospin invariance , the absence of second class currents , and neglecting the induced pseudoscalar form factor ( in some analyses , this form factor is retained in its simplified pole form , @xmath74 ) , the hadronic current matrix element between nucleon states is given by @xmath75   \\ , u(p)~,\\ ] ] with @xmath76 the squared momentum transfer . because of vector current conservation , the dirac and pauli vector form factors appearing in equation  ( [ wcurrent ] ) are the same as the ones measured in elastic electron ",
    "hadron scattering and can therefore be considered as known . what is usually assumed in the analysis of the neutrino scattering experiments",
    "is the dipole parameterization for the sachs form factors , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "it has the form : @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the proton / neutron magnetic moment and @xmath84gev .",
    "the axial form factor is then extracted by fitting the @xmath30-dependence of the ( anti)neutrino - nucleon cross section , @xmath85\\ ] ] in which @xmath86 is contained in the bilinear forms @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 of the relevant form factors and is assumed to be the only unknown quantity @xmath90~ , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "of course , for elastic scattering @xmath93 the terms @xmath94 should be dropped . due to the smallness of the lepton mass",
    ", they are usually also dropped for the quasi - elastic reactions .",
    "furthermore , @xmath95 is the neutrino energy which is usually determined from the neutrino flux spectrum . using the the dipole parameterization equation  ( [ dipole ] ) allows then to determine @xmath22 from a fit to the measured ( anti)neutrino cross section .",
    "here , one assumes that heavy quark corrections to the axial current can be neglected , although they are not necessarily small @xcite .",
    "in particular , the so - called strange quark content of the nucleon has attracted much attention over the last decade .",
    "since the @xmath30-dependence for such type of contribution is not known , one can simply modify the dipole ansatz to @xmath96 , with @xmath97 parameterizing the strange ( heavy ) quark contribution .",
    "we do not wish to further elaborate on this topic but rather refer to the references  @xcite .",
    "consider now pion electroproduction off nucleons , @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the virtual photon with virtuality @xmath100 , @xmath101 @xmath102 the initial / final nucleon and @xmath103 the pion with cartesian isospin @xmath104 and four  momentum @xmath105 .",
    "we will also use the positive definite quantity @xmath106 .",
    "the pertinent mandelstam variables are @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , subject to the constraint @xmath110 , with @xmath111 the pion mass . in the born ( one - photon - exchange ) approximation",
    ", the corresponding coincidence cross section can be factorized as @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the virtual photon flux , @xmath114 , @xmath115 the energy and the solid angle of the scattered electron , and @xmath116 is the virtual photon cross section in the centre - of - mass frame of the final @xmath117 system , as denoted by the star .",
    "it can be further decomposed into transverse , longitudinal and two interference parts , @xmath118 with the transverse ( @xmath119 ) and longitudinal ( @xmath120 ) polarizations of the virtual photon fixed by the electron kinematics . in parallel kinematics ( @xmath121 , with @xmath122 the polar angle in the scattering plane as seen in the laboratory system )",
    "the interference parts vanish .",
    "therefore , at constant four  momentum transfer , the transverse and the longitudinal cross sections can be separated using the rosenbluth method by varying @xmath119 , @xmath123 ( note that often the photon energy is denoted by @xmath124 , however , here this symbol is entirely reserved for the pion energy ) . at low energies , the connection to theory",
    "is most easily made by means of the multipole expansion . for doing that",
    ", one considers the transition current related to equation  ( [ elbasic ] ) , which can be decomposed in terms of six invariant amplitudes ( we follow the conventions and notations of reference  @xcite , see also @xcite ) @xmath125 with @xmath126 the spin index of nucleon @xmath127 .",

    "while the methods of current algebra ( ca ) should be considered outdated by now , we consider it nevertheless instructive to briefly review the ca argument which gives the link between charged pion electroproduction and the nucleon axial form factor . using standard lsz formalism , the transition matrix element can be written as @xmath143 with @xmath144 the electromagnetic current operator to which the nucleon couples , @xmath105 the pion four  momentum and @xmath145 is the conventional time  ordering operator .",
    "inserting now the pcac relation @xmath146 and performing a partial integration ( note that while the meaning of the pcac relation has been understood since long  @xcite , it does not offer a systematic way of calculating higher order corrections ) , one gets @xmath147",

    "because of the @xmath119tensor , the axial form factor can only appear in charged pion electroproduction . in the chiral limit , nambu , luri and shrauner",
    "@xcite have put this in the form of a low - energy theorem for the electric dipole amplitude @xmath31 , @xmath154 with @xmath155 the nucleon isovector magnetic form factor . the second term in this equation stems from the nucleon pole contribution in the chiral limit .",
    "expanding this to @xmath156 , one finds @xmath157 with @xmath158 the nucleon isovector anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "of course , this equation is only correct for massless pions with zero three  momentum . before the advent of chiral perturbation theory",
    ", there existed many prescriptions to get a handle on the corrections due to the pion mass , see references  @xcite-@xcite for a textbook treatment of this issue , see e.g.  reference  @xcite .",
    "this was already addressed in section  [ sec : data ] in connection with theoretical uncertainties of the axial form factor extracted from electroproduction based on various prescriptions to deal with the corrections beyond the soft  pion limit .",
    "these uncertainties can and have to be overcome using the modern methods discussed next . to end this section , we remark that in principle equation  ( [ tax ] ) should also include the induced pseudoscalar form factor .",
    "however , in soft ",
    "pion limit the @xmath12 term is proportional to the photon momentum @xmath159 , and when contracted with the photon polarization vector , one obtains the structure @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , the induced pseudoscalar form factor only contributes to the longitudinal cross section , more precisely to the longitudinal s  wave multipole @xmath137 ( as discussed in section  [ sec : pion ] ) but _ not _ to the transverse multipole @xmath136 which is entirely sensitive to the axial form factor ( radius ) .        in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss the effective field theory of the standard model ( sm ) , chiral perturbation theory , without giving any technical details .",
    "for that , we refer the reader to a number of reviews @xcite . at energies and momenta much below the scale set by the intermediate vector boson masses , the weak interactions are frozen and the su(3)@xmath161su(2)@xmath162u(1)@xmath163 standard model simplifies to su(3)@xmath161u(1 ) , i.e qcd in the presence of qed .",
    "these two theories behave very differently at low energies .",
    "qed is characterized by a small coupling constant , @xmath164 , that means the photons and leptons almost decouple and very precise perturbative calculations can be performed . on the other hand , the qcd coupling constant becomes large at low energies , @xmath165 and the underlying fields ( quarks and gluons ) are confined within hadrons .",
    "consequently , to study the strong interactions , one essentially has to consider qcd in the presence of external sources embodying the electroweak interactions .",
    "apart from lattice gauge theory attempts , which are plagued by their own conceptual problems , no first principle calculations for this theory are possible . however , one can make use of the _ symmetries _ of qcd and their realizations to explore in a model  independent way the _ chiral dynamics _ of qcd .",
    "this is based on the observation that the six quark flavors fall into two distinct classes , the light ( u , d , s ) and the heavy ( c , b , t ) ones ( light / heavy compared to the typical hadronic scale of 1 gev ) .",
    "therefore , to a good first approximation one can consider an ideal world with @xmath166 i.e. only the light flavors are active and the heavy ones decouple .",
    "this is called the chiral limit of qcd .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian , @xmath167 , contains only one parameter , @xmath168 ( or , by dimensional transmutation , @xmath169 ) .",
    "@xmath170 is highly symmetric because the gluon interactions with the quark triplet @xmath171 are flavor  blind .",
    "in particular , one can decompose the quark fields in left and right  handed components .",
    "these can be independently transformed under su(3)@xmath172 and su(3)@xmath173 leaving @xmath167 invariant . by noether s theorem ,",
    "this leads to eight conserved vector , @xmath174 , and eight conserved axial  vector , @xmath175 , currents .",
    "from these , one can construct conserved charges , @xmath176 = [ q_a^a , h_{\\rm qcd}^0 ] \\quad ( a = 1,\\ldots,8)~.\\ ] ] this is the so  called _ chiral symmetry of the strong interactions _ , which has indeed been observed long before the advent of qcd and led to current algebra and soft pion techniques ( as used in the previous subsection ) .",
    "however , this symmetry is not necessarily shared by the ground state or the particle spectrum ( hidden or spontaneously broken symmetry ) .",
    "so what is the fate of the chiral symmetry in qcd ? for any vector  like gauge theory in the absence of @xmath177terms , one can show that the vacuum is invariant under vector transformations  @xcite .",
    "concerning the axial transformations , nature selects the nambu ",
    "goldstone alternative , i.e the ground state @xmath178 is not symmetric and the left and right  handed worlds communicate , as indicated by the non  vanishing quark condensate . because the axial charges do not annihilate the vacuum , the spectrum must contain eight pseudoscalar goldstone bosons , one for each broken generator .",

    "ii led to a pion radius of  @xcite @xmath257 which is a sizeably larger value than the one obtained from @xmath258 scattering .",
    "it was hinted in reference  @xcite that their larger value for the pion radius might be due to the inevitable model  dependence based on the born term approach to extract the pion radius .",
    "it was also stated that there might be an additional correction obtainable form chiral perturbation theory as it is the case for the nucleon axial radius discussed before .",
    "indeed , there is such a similar kind of correction for the pion radius  @xcite .",
    "this new term modifies the momentum dependence of the longitudinal s ",
    "wave amplitude @xmath259 and leads one to expect an even larger pion charge radius than the one given in equation  ( [ mamirad ] ) .",
    "it is conceivable that higher order corrections yet to be calculated or contributions from higher multipoles will completely resolve the discrepancy between the pion radius determined from @xmath258 scattering on one side and from charged pion electroproduction on the other .",
    "let us be more specific now .",
    "as shown in equation  ( [ l0pm ] ) , the pion vector form factor @xmath260 appears in the expression for the longitudinal multipole .",
    "the pion form factor has the following low ",
    "energy expansion , @xmath261 consequently , to separate the pion radius , one should consider the slope of the longitudinal multipole . for doing that , one has to expand the function @xmath262 in powers of @xmath210 and pick up all terms proportional to @xmath189 .",
    "this gives : @xmath263 the first four terms are standard  @xcite , they comprise the conventional dependence on the pion vector radius , recoil effects and the dominant chiral limit behavior of the slope of the longitudinal multipole .",
    "the strong @xmath264 chiral singularity stems from the @xmath211derivative of the pion ",
    "pole term which appears already at leading order in the chiral expansion ( this is the leading contribution from the _ induced pseudoscalar form factor _ ) .",
    "the last term in equation  ( [ l0 ] ) originates from the so  called triangle and tadpole ( with three pions coupling to the nucleon at one point ) diagrams which are known to play a prominent role in pion photo and electroproduction ( see figure  [ fig : diaax ] ) .",
    "the formal reason for the appearance of this new , model  independent contribution at order @xmath211 is that one can not interchange the order of taking the derivative at @xmath265 and the chiral limit @xmath217 .",
    "consequently , all determinations of the pion radius from electroproduction ( based on tree - level amplitudes including nucleon and pion form factors ) have `` measured '' the modified radius , @xmath266 the novel term on the right  hand - side of equation  ( [ modrad ] ) amounts to 0.266  fm@xmath20 , a bit more than half of the squared pion rms radius , @xmath268fm@xmath20 .",
    "therefore , from the longitudinal multipole alone , one expects to find a larger pion radius if one analyses pion electroproduction based on born terms , @xmath269 which is even larger than the result of the mainz analysis , cf .",
    "equation  ( [ mamirad ] ) .",
    "we point out , however , that the contribution of the pion radius to the derivative of the longitudinal multipole is a factor of ten smaller than the one from the first three terms in the curly brackets in equation  ( [ l0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , a fourth order analysis is certainly needed to further quantify the `` pion radius discrepancy '' .",
    "furthermore , the pion form factor contribution to the longitudinal cross section is also present in higher multipoles .",
    "in fact , it is known that the convergence of the multipole series for the pion pole term is slow .",
    "one should therefore also investigate such effects for these higher multipoles or directly compare the predictions of complete one  loop calculation with the data of the longitudinal electroproduction cross section .",
    "for the purpose of demonstrating the significance of chiral loop effects the @xmath211-slope is , however , best suited .",
    "what has been shown here is that as in the case of the nucleon axial mean square radius , the pion loops , which are a unique consequence of the chiral symmetry of qcd , modify the naive born term analysis and should be taken into account .",
    "here , we show that one can give an accurate prediction for the induced pseudoscalar form factor @xmath12 and coupling constant @xmath25 in terms of well  known physical parameters , following reference  @xcite ( for a similar analysis , see @xcite ) . for doing that , one exploits the chiral ward identity of two  flavor qcd , @xmath270 with @xmath271 the average light quark mass ( note that isospin  breaking effects can be safely neglected here ) .",
    "sandwiching equation  ( [ e3 ] ) between nucleon states , one obtains @xcite @xmath272 the pion pole in equation  ( [ e4 ] ) originates from the direct coupling of the pseudoscalar density to the pion , @xmath273 @xcite .",

    "the reason for the linear dependence in equation  ( [ e6 ] ) is the following .",
    "the corresponding form factors @xmath11 and @xmath276 have a cut starting at @xmath279 which in the chiral expansion first shows up at two  loop order @xmath280 .",
    "therefore , the contribution to order @xmath223 must be polynomial in @xmath53 . furthermore , from chiral counting it follows that the @xmath281-terms are related to order @xmath282 of the full matrix  elements . putting pieces together ,",

    "first , notice that only physical and well  determined parameters enter in this formula .",
    "second , while the first term on the right  hand  side is of order @xmath288 , the second one is @xmath289 and the corrections not calculated are of order @xmath290 .",
    "third , the first term is the celebrated pion pole term , which stems from the direct coupling of the pion field to the pseudoscalar source .",
    "it clearly dominates this form factor for momentum transfers of the order of a few pion masses . also , because of the pion pole",
    ", the structure of this form factor is not of the common form , i.e. its low  energy expansion is not a polynom characterized by some normalization and a radius . because of the ward identities , it is linked to the axial form factor as witnessed by the appearance of the axial radius in equation  ( [ e9 ] ) . for the pseudoscalar coupling @xmath25 ,",
    "this leads to @xmath291 indeed , this relation has been derived long time ago by adler and dothan  @xcite and by wolfenstein @xcite .",
    "wolfenstein used a once  subtracted dispersion relation for the right  hand  side of equation  ( [ e4 ] ) ( weak pcac ) .",
    "it is gratifying that the adw result can be firmly based on the systematic chiral expansion of low energy qcd green functions . in chiral perturbation theory ,",
    "one could in principle calculate the corrections to equation  ( [ e10 ] ) by performing a two  loop calculation while in wolfenstein s method these could only be estimated . to stress it again",
    ", the main ingredient to arrive at equation  ( [ e10 ] ) in chpt is the linear @xmath53dependence in equation  ( [ e6 ] ) . since we are interested here in a very small momentum transfer , like e.g.for the case of ordinary muon capture , @xmath292 , curvature terms of order @xmath281 have to be negligible .",
    "if one uses for example the dipole parameterization for the axial form factor , the @xmath281term amounts to a 1.3@xmath293 correction to the one linear in @xmath53 .",
    "the masses @xmath195 , @xmath27 and @xmath294 are accurately known and so are @xmath295 and @xmath15 @xcite . the situation concerning the strong pion ",
    "nucleon coupling constant is less favorable .",
    "the methodologically best determination based on dispersion theory gave @xmath296 @xcite , more recent determinations seem to favor smaller values @xcite .",
    "we use here @xmath297 .",
    "the value for the axial radius has been discussed in section  [ sec : axdata ] , we use here the number obtained from neutrino scattering .",
    "putting pieces together , we arrive at @xmath298 the uncertainties stem from the range of @xmath200 and from the one for @xmath299 for the first and second term , in order . for the final result on @xmath25 , we have added these uncertainties in quadrature .",
    "a measurement with a 2@xmath293 accuracy of @xmath25 , as intended by the upcoming experiment @xcite , could therefore cleanly separate between the pion pole contribution and the improved chpt result .",
    "this would mean a significant progress in our understanding of this fundamental low ",
    "energy parameter since the presently available determinations have too large error bars to disentangle these values , see section  [ sec : gpdata ] .",

    "nucleon coupling constant which has been at the center of much controversy over the last years . to summarize",
    ", we have shown that the chiral ward identities allow to predict the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant entirely in terms of well  determined physical parameters within a few percent accuracy . as already noted by wolfenstein @xcite , an accurate empirical determination of this quantity therefore poses a stringent test on our understanding of the underlying dynamics which is believed to be realized in the effective low  energy field theory of qcd .",
    "as detailed in section  [ sec : gpdata ] , measurements of omc on liquid hydrogen allow one to extract a value for the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant that agrees with theoretical expectations .",
    "the theoretical description of the hadronic physics involved is fairly transparent , we follow reference  @xcite and refer to that paper for many details .",
    "however , as stressed in particular by ando , myhrer and kubodera  @xcite , there are some difficulties with the accepted picture of translating the atomic rates into the one for liquid hydrogen .",
    "this topic will be taken up at the end of this section .",
    "first , we consider the omc ( atomic ) decay rates calculated to third order in the chiral expansion and also to third order in the so  called `` small scale expansion '' , which is an effective field theory with explicit @xmath240 degrees of freedom ( for a detailed introduction and review , see  @xcite ) . in the fermi approximation of a static @xmath300 field ,",
    "i.e. the gauge boson propagator is reduced to a point interaction ( since the typical momenta involved are much smaller than the @xmath301 mass ) , @xmath302~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the vector current matrix element @xmath303 ( the so - called vector correlator ) is parameterized in terms of the isovector vector dirac and pauli form factors @xmath304 , which are known empirically ( see e.g. @xcite ) and have also been studied in baryon chpt  @xcite .",
    "the axial correlator contains the desired dependence on the induced pseudoscalar form factor . introducing the fermi constant @xmath305 , the square of the _ spin - averaged _ invariant matrix element is defined via @xmath306 with @xmath307 the pertinent ckm matrix element and the explicit forms of the symmetric leptonic @xmath308 , see also equation  ( [ lnu ] ) , and the hadronic tensor @xmath309 are given in @xcite .",
    "approximating now the muonic atom wave  function dependence by its value at the origin ( thus neglecting the small third order effects due to the form factors ) , the @xmath310 bohr wave function of the muonic atom reads @xmath311 with the reduced mass @xmath312 and @xmath313 the fine  structure constant .",
    "we can therefore calculate the spin ",
    "averaged rate of ordinary muon capture via @xmath314 with @xmath315 , @xmath316 appropriate normalization factors .",
    "evaluating this to third order , @xmath317 , one obtains @xmath318 which shows a very fast convergence . retaining the delta only reduces the small third order correction by 5% .",
    "the reason for the nice stability of perturbative calculations for omc in the physical world of small finite quark masses is of course the fact that contributions of order @xmath319 are suppressed by @xmath320 , with @xmath321 and @xmath322  gev .",
    "this spin  averaged omc scenario is mostly of theoretical interest . in nature",
    "the weak interactions show a very strong spin  dependence , which leads to quite different decay rates depending on whether the captured 1s muon forms a singlet or a triplet spin - state with the proton @xcite , where the singlet is the usual state @xmath323 in terms of the muon and proton spins and the triplet accordingly , see also figure  [ fig : omc ] and the discussion in section  [ sec : gpdata ] . although the hyperfine splitting between the two levels `` only '' amounts to 0.04  ev , the occupation numbers of the levels due to thermal and collision induced processes tend to be far from statistical equilibrium . in order to make any contact with experiment , the singlet / triplet rates need to be calculated separately . for the total capture rates of singlet and the triplet states in the muonic atom ,",
    "one find the following decomposition into leading , next  to  leading and next  to  next  to  leading order pieces @xmath324 displaying the dramatic spin - dependence due to the v - a structure of the weak interactions in the standard model .",
    "these numbers correspond to a value of @xmath325 and include the pion pole corrections , cf . equation  ( [ e10 ] ) .",

    "only photons with an energy @xmath394mev were detected .",
    "we therefore now move on to a discussion of the photon spectrum @xmath395 .",
    "it can be obtained straightforwardly from equation  ( [ rmcrate ] ) .",

    ".    0.1 cm    the relative difference between the second order chpt and sse calculation for all states are of the order of a few percent , showing explicitly the small role of @xmath58(1232 ) in rmc .",
    "these results are very similar to the ones found by beder and fearing  @xcite for the spectra and the relative contribution from the spin3/2 resonance , although their calculation is based on a very different approach .",
    "even the result for the small singlet is comparable though not identical to the one of beder and fearing .",
    "we conclude that the strong interaction theory for rmc is under control .",
    "the photon spectra just discussed allow in principle to determine the induced pseudoscalar form factor .",
    "the triumf result for @xmath25 is obtained by multiplying the terms proportional to the pseudoscalar form factor with a constant denoted @xmath373 ( the momentum dependence is assumed to be entirely given by the pion pole ) .",
    "the value of @xmath373 is then extracted using the model of fearing to match the partial rate for photon energies larger than 60  mev .",
    "if we perform such a procedure , we get a similar shift in the partial photon spectra .",
    "it is , however , obvious from the analysis presented above that such a procedure is not legitimate . by artificially enhancing the contribution @xmath396 ( to simulate this procedure ,",
    "we have introduced the factor @xmath373 in equation  ( [ vacorr ] ) and similarly one must multiply @xmath397 by @xmath373 ) , one mocks up a whole class of new contact and other terms not present in the born term model . to demonstrate these points in a more quantitative fashion ,",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : specr ] the partial branching fraction in comparison to the one with @xmath25 enhanced by a factor 1.5 and a third curve , which is obtained by increasing @xmath25 only by 15% and slightly modifying some parameters related to the delta contribution .",
    "this is shown by the dashed line and it shows that such a combination of small effects can explain most ( but not all ) of the shift in the spectrum .",
    "this is further sharpened by using now the neutral pion mass of 134.97  mev instead of the charged pion mass , leading to the dotted curve in figure  [ fig : specr ] .",
    "since the pion mass difference is almost entirely of electromagnetic origin , one might speculate that isospin  breaking effects should not be neglected .",
    "furthermore , as discussed above a slight change in the occupation numbers @xmath398 and @xmath399 would also lead to an increase in the ortho capture rate which could close the gap between the empirical and theoretical results .",
    "for example the dashed curve in figure  [ fig : specr ] would be moved from 0.42 to 0.48 while the dotted one would go from 0.50 to 0.54 with @xmath400 and @xmath401 at @xmath402mev .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of the sigma term analysis , where many small effects combine to give the sizeable difference between the sigma term at zero momentum transfer and at the cheng - dashen point .",
    "another point against the simple rescaling comes from omc . indeed if this rescaling holds for rmc it should also hold for omc .",
    "we thus have performed a similar calculation in omc .",
    "taking the same value for r , one would obtain @xmath403 leading to @xmath404 , which is lower than the error bars of the experimental result from reference  @xcite .",
    "as expected , the singlet and triplet capture rates are much more sensitive to the details of the interaction than the total rate . as a conclusion we note that the effect of enhancing the capture rates in rmc via setting @xmath405 leads to a strong reduction of the corresponding omc rates leading to conflicts with the experimentally determined ortho capture rate . to summarize this discussion ,",
    "we have pointed out that two effects in particular have to be investigated in more detail : ( 1 ) the occupation numbers of the atomic structure in muonic atoms / molecules need to be carefully re - examined , and ( 2 ) the n@xmath20lo calculation should be redone including all isospin breaking effects because of the sensitivity to the exact pion mass in the pion - pole contributions , for example .",
    "the sum of these small effects should explain the observed photon spectrum , as we believe that the proper hadronic / weak physics part is well under control by now .",
    "a simple rescaling of the pseudoscalar coupling constant should no longer be considered .",
    "in section  [ sec : gp ] we already encountered the goldberger ",
    "treiman discrepancy ( gtd ) , i.e. the deviation from the goldberger ",
    "treiman relation ( gtr ) , which is exact in the chiral limit .",

    "note , however , that if one chooses the @xmath206meson mass as the relevant hadronic scale , @xmath411 , this estimate increases to @xmath412 .",
    "one can further sharpen this argument by extending the analysis to flavor su(3 ) and also investigate consistency of the strange to light quark mass ratio as obtained from the goldstone boson spectrum .",
    "this is based on the observation that while in su(2 ) the gtd is given in terms of one lec , in chiral su(3 ) this quantity is given in terms of a sum of quark masses times an su(3 ) octet operator .",

    "note that higher order strong as well as electromagnetic corrections do not change this leading order estimate appreciably , see e.g. @xcite",
    ". then one can ask the question whether three gtds are mutually consistent , that is whether the dwr is fulfilled . another way of exploring this relation is to determine the three discrepancies from data and then use the dwr to deduce the quark mass ratio @xmath438 . as input ,",
    "we use the pdg values for the masses and axial coupling constants together with @xmath439 and @xmath440 as obtained from the analysis of hyperon  antihyperon production at lear  @xcite .",
    "these numbers are close to the expectations from flavor su(3 ) , @xmath441 and @xmath442 , respectively , and in rough agreement with the analysis of @xmath443n scattering data given in reference  @xcite .",
    "this leads to the following values of the kaon discrepancies @xmath444 these numbers conform to the expectations from su(3 ) symmetry breaking , @xmath445 , but the theoretical uncertainties might be larger as the ones given , see the discussion at the end of this section .",
    "using now the quark mass ratio as deduced from the goldstone boson masses and the central values of the gtds , one obtains @xmath446 , which favors the low value of the pion ",
    "nucleon coupling constant .",
    "if , on the other hand , one uses the empirical values of the gtds , see equations  ( [ gtdpi],[gtdk ] ) , one obtains for the quark mass ratio @xmath447 i.e. the smaller value of @xmath327 is consistent with the standard scenario of chiral symmetry breaking , that is a large value of the quark condensate , @xmath448gev .",
    "one could be content with this consistency since the so determined quark mass ratio is in good agreement with the one obtained from analyzing the goldstone boson mass spectrum based on the large condensate scenario .",
    "however , as already stressed in @xcite , a better and more reliable determination of the strong coupling constants @xmath449 and @xmath450 is called for . in this context",
    "it is worth to stress that extraction of these couplings from kaon electroproduction data usually leads to very different values , see e.g. @xcite and the discussion in reference  @xcite .",
    "note , however , that most of these kaon electroproduction analyses are based on simple born terms ( including resonance excitations and form factors ) and are therefore plagued with large theoretical uncertainties . in the light of the new and coming data on kaon electropoduction off protons and deuterium from elsa and cebaf , it would be very valuable to apply the theoretical framework of references  @xcite , which combines chiral perturbation theory , unitarity and coupled channel dynamics ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "this value is consistently obtained from ( anti)neutrino scattering off protons ( or light nuclei ) and charged pion electroproduction off protons .",
    "clearly , more precise electroproduction data in the threshold region would be welcome to further pin down this quantity .",
    "the induced pseudoscalar form factor is dominated by the pion pole , but the small corrections to this leading order result have been calculated .",
    "existing data from ordinary muon capture are consistent with these theoretical expectations but have too large error bars to cleanly test the chiral dynamics of qcd .",
    "we have argued that the result of the pioneering triumf radiative muon capture experiment should be taken _ cum grano salis _ due to some assumptions in the analysis that are inconsistent with the power counting underlying the effective field theory of the standard model .",
    "however , it is fair to say that more theoretical as well as experimental effort is needed for drawing a final conclusion .",
    "the momentum  dependence of the induced pseudoscalar form factor is dominated by the pion pole which has only been tested in one electroproduction experiment so far . also , a better determination of strong kaon - hyperon - nucleon coupling constants @xmath449 and @xmath450 would allow for an additional stringent bound on the light to strange quark mass ratio , based on the derivations from the octet goldberger  treiman relations .",
    "all this shows that precision experiments in hadron and nuclear physics indeed help to unravel the mysteries of qcd at energies where one really has to deal with _",
    "strong _ interactions .",
    "therefore , more pion and kaon electroproduction as well as muon capture experiments are called for .",
    "we are grateful to norbert kaiser and thomas hemmert for fruitful collaborations , fred myhrer for sharing his insight into the theory of muon capture and simon irca for detailed explanation of the mami data and analysis .",
    "useful communications from barry holstein , jacques martino and claude petitjean are acknowledged .",
    "we thank josef speth for initiating this project .",
    "we also thank the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft and the elsa / mami schwerpunktprogramm for funding the workshop on `` hadron form factors '' in bad honnef in april 2001 , which triggered this write - up .",
    "this work was supported in part by the nsf , grant 34201 .",
