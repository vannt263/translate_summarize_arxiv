    "explicit expressions for the decay rate and energy level shifts of an atom in the presence of an ideal conducting wedge , two conducting parallel plates and a half - sheet are obtained in the frame work of the canonical quantization approach .",
    "the angular and radial dependence of the decay rate for different atomic polarizations of an excited atom and also of the energy level shifts are depicted and discussed .",
    "the consistency of the present approach in some limiting cases is investigated by comparing the relevant results obtained here to the previously reported results . for distances from the cusp smaller than a certain value determined by the opening angle of the wedge",
    ", there are configurations for which the atom will not decay at all .",
    "this is more clearly understood for the case of conducting parallel plates where for the case of a transition dipole moment parallel to the plates , a strong suppression occurs for @xmath126 since the mode density for the electric field parallel to the surface vanishes for @xmath126 .",
    "the appearance of enhancement or inhibition of the emission depends not only on the dipole location of the atom but also on the dipole orientational of the atom and the opening angle of the wedge .",
