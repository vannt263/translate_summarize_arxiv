    "<S> we also show that it is the  small - world \" property that plays the key role in the thermodynamic stability and is responsible for the universal scaling @xmath9 , regardless of the model details .    </S>",
    "<S> vibrational dynamics has been widely used to study thermodynamic properties of various structures in solid state physics and/or other disciplines @xcite . since the structure is considered as a primary factor responsible for physical properties , to keep the underlying structure thermally stable </S>",
    "<S> is of primary important for systems to function properly . </S>",
    "<S> for example , proteins , comprising an extremely heterogeneous class of biological macromolecules , must be stable enough against thermal fluctuations and/or external perturbations so as to maintain their native structures and to function correctly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a natural and important question is often asked : what is the structure effect on thermodynamic stability ? in this paper , we study the stability of small - world structures @xcite , which is then exemplified by proteins .    </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of @xmath7 coupled oscillators on the network in contact with the external heat reservoir can be expressed as : @xmath10 where @xmath11^t$ ] , denotes the oscillator s displacements from the equilibrium positions . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 is the mass matrix , where @xmath13 denotes the mass of the @xmath14th oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath15 is the spring constant . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is the laplacian matrix and @xmath17 is the adjacency matrix of the network , where @xmath18 if @xmath14 and @xmath19 are connected and @xmath20 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21 is the dissipation matrix where @xmath22 is the dissipation coefficient of the @xmath14th oscillator influenced by the heat reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> vector @xmath23^t$ ] denotes the thermal fluctuation with zero mean and variance @xmath24 , which is the usual fluctuation - dissipation relation .    </S>",
    "<S> the harmonic potential we adopt looks very simple but can capture the main features of the system . </S>",
    "<S> for example , tirion @xcite demonstrates that a single - parameter harmonic potential can reproduce vibrational properties of the real macromolecular system very well . </S>",
    "<S> thereafter , the gaussian network model ( gnm ) @xcite has been widely used in protein research and yields results in good agreement with experiments . in the gnm model , the interactions are considered as homogeneous harmonic springs , which is in analogy with the elasticity theory of random polymer networks @xcite .

    "<S> it excludes zero mode which correspondes to the translational invariance of the system , and is the inverse of @xmath32 in the subspace orthogonal to the zero mode : @xmath33 where @xmath34 are the non - zero eigenvalues , and @xmath35 denote the corresponding normalized eigenvectors of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can obtain the average mean - square displacement straightforwardly : @xmath36 this formula relates the dynamic vibration property @xmath0 to the static structure property  the eigenvalue spectrum of laplacian matrix @xmath32 . when the average mean - square displacement @xmath0 reaches the square of the typical spacing between oscillators , the structure encounters large vibrations and becomes unstable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , small value of @xmath0 means stable , while large value means unstable . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that @xmath0 has a trivial dependance on @xmath37 and @xmath15 so that lower temperature or larger spring constant indicates more thermal stability . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to study the structure effect on @xmath0 , we take @xmath38 in the following , without loss of generality .    based on eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : c ] ) and ( [ eq : s ] ) , we can use exact numerical diagonalizations of the laplacian matrix @xmath32 to study the structure effect on thermodynamic stability .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the stability can be also studied by perturbation analysis , through which we find that the cross - links can suppress the thermodynamic instability , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , _ decrease @xmath0 effectively . </S>",
    "<S> after structure changes , the new laplacian matrix is constructed as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> the new correlation matrix @xmath41 can be written as @xmath42 this is a standard algebraic algebra treatment of matrix perturbation , which can be simply regarded as taylor series . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is similar to the dyson equation in feynman - dyson perturbation theory @xcite . for the case of adding a link between nodes @xmath14 and @xmath19 , the perturbation matrix @xmath40 can be expressed as @xmath43 substituting the expression of @xmath40 into @xmath41 , one obtains @xmath44 where @xmath45 . </S>",

    "<S> i.e. _ , with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",

    "<S> it indicates that no thermodynamically stable solid exists at finite temperature in 1d . indeed , when the average mean - square displacement @xmath0 exceeds the square of the typical spacing between oscillators , the structure behaves like a liquid rather than a solid , and the crystalline order makes no sense anymore . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is also reported in @xcite . for the case of @xmath51 , even of small value , as @xmath7 increases , @xmath0 is saturated to a finite value rapidly . moreover , from fig . </S>",

    "<S> , there is a regime with slope @xmath52 , @xmath57 , which indicates a convergent stable phase . in other words , when the number of cross - links is much larger than one , @xmath0 approaches a finite value at large @xmath7 and scales as @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> since the average mean - square displacement @xmath0 is related to the spectral properties of the laplacian matrix @xmath32 , we can understand the scaling behavior of @xmath0 in terms of its eigenvalue spectrum @xmath59 . for large size @xmath7 , </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : s ] ) can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath60 from which we can easily see that the density of small @xmath61 dominates the behavior of @xmath0 . for the case without cross - links , the system reduces to a 1d ring chain , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 for small @xmath61 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : s - n ] and [ fig : scaling ] . </S>",
    "<S> although the argument above is not rigorous and applies only when @xmath6 is smaller than one , it gives us quite good understanding of the scaling behavior of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath6 is larger than one , the model we used is more like an erds - rnyi model , which is also to be demonstrated to follow the same scaling of the stable regime at the end of this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the small - world structure we used above is well studied @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using renormalization group method , the authors in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed that this model undergoes a transition between regular lattice and random one at intermediate characteristic size @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the phase transition has a critical point @xmath72 in the thermodynamical limit when @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> for finite size @xmath7 , the diameter @xmath65 scales linearly with @xmath7 for @xmath74 as it is in 1d ring chain , while @xmath75 for @xmath76 , where it exhibits  small - world \" property . </S>",
    "<S> our results about unstable and stable phases are consistent with their findings that the unstable regime corresponds to the 1d case and the stable phase corresponds to the  small - world \" case .    as an illustrative example </S>",
    "<S> , the thermodynamic stability is further tested on real protein data . </S>",
    "<S> we revisit the proteins used in ref . </S>",

    "<S> all the structure data are downloaded from the protein data bank ( pdb ) @xcite and the number of all residue pairs is counted within a customary cutoff @xmath79  . after eliminating the connectivity number of the primary structure of protein from the counted number , we obtain the number of cross - links , @xmath80 , for each protein . </S>",
    "<S> the mean square displacement of c@xmath81 atoms is characterized by @xmath82-factor @xcite , also called debye - waller or temperature factor : @xmath83 , where @xmath14 is the index of amino acid residue . </S>",
