    "however , a large set of constraints is required to reliably determine both cosmological and galactic properties .",

    "we discuss the intrinsic variability hypothesis at the end of this section .",
    "we focus on the ab , ac , and ad comparisons , i.e. , the a light curve is compared to the other three brightness records ( b  d ) . the @xmath25 and @xmath26 minimizations are characterized by a decorrelation length ( @xmath27 ) and a bin semisize ( @xmath28 ) , respectively . to simultaneously avoid very noisy trends and loss of signal ( due to excessive smoothing ) , we take @xmath28 = @xmath27 = 15 days . for @xmath28",

    "therefore , one obtains a synthetic light curve of an image by adding a random quantity to each brightness in the observed record .",
    "these random quantities are realizations of a normal distribution around zero , with a standard deviation equal to the standard deviation between observed magnitudes on consecutive nights .",
    "we produce 1000 synthetic light curves of each image , and thus , obtain 1000 delay values for each pair ( ab , ac , and ad ) and the corresponding 68% confidence intervals . in the second approach ,",
    "we use a bootstrap procedure ( bootstrap ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "first , we derive a combined light curve from the best solutions of @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 ( global minima of the three spectra ) , and the associated magnitude differences .",
    "this combined curve is then smoothed by a 20day filter .",
    "second , the combined and smoothed curve is assumed to be a rough reconstruction of the underlying signal , and thus , the residuals for each image are taken as sets of errors .",

    "the four measurements are consistent with each other .",
    "table  [ tbl2 ] also indicates the existence of an average offset of about 3 days between the results from the normal approach and those derived from bootstrap simulations .",

    "<S> we then use the observed ( intrinsic ) variations of @xmath2 50@xmath3100 mmag to measure the three time delays for the lens system for the first time ( 1@xmath4 confidence intervals ) : @xmath5 = @xmath317 @xmath6 3 , @xmath7 = @xmath320 @xmath6 4 , and @xmath8 = 23 @xmath6 4 days ( @xmath9 ; b and c are leading , while d is trailing ) . </S>",
    "<S> although time delays for lens systems are often used to obtain the hubble constant ( @xmath10 ) , the unavailability of the spectroscopic lens redshift ( @xmath11 ) in the system h1413 + 117 prevents a determination of @xmath10 from the measured delays . in this paper , the new time delay constraints and a concordance expansion rate ( @xmath10 = 70 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 ) allow us to improve the lens model and to estimate the previously unknown @xmath11 . our 1@xmath4 estimate @xmath11 = 1.88@xmath13 is an example of how to infer the redshift of very distant galaxies via gravitational lensing . </S>"
