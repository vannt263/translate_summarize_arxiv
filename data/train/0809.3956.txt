    "deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of leptons off nucleons probes the structure of matter at small distance scales",
    ". two types of dis interactions are possible at hera : neutral current ( nc ) reactions @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where a photon or @xmath3 boson is exchanged and charged current ( cc ) interactions @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where a @xmath6 boson is exchanged .",
    "the kinematics of charged current and neutral current deep inelastic scattering processes are defined by the four - momenta of the incoming lepton ( @xmath7 ) , the incoming proton ( @xmath8 ) , the outgoing lepton ( @xmath9 ) and the hadronic final state ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the four - momentum transfer between the electron and the proton is given by @xmath11 .",
    "the square of the centre - of - mass energy is given by @xmath12 .",
    "the description of dis is usually given in terms of three lorentz invariant quantities , which may be defined in terms of the four - momenta @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath13 :    * @xmath14 , the negative square of the four - momentum transfer , * @xmath15 , the bjorken scaling variable , * @xmath16 , the fraction of the energy transferred to the proton in its rest frame .",
    "these variables are related by @xmath17 , when the masses of the incoming particles can be neglected .",
    "this paper presents the most recent measurements of the cross sections for @xmath18 nc and cc dis with longitudinally polarised lepton beams .",
    "the measurements are based on around @xmath19 of data collected at a centre - of - mass energy of @xmath20 .",
    "the measured cross sections are compared to the standard model predictions .",
    "next - to - leading - order qcd analyses of hera data are also presented .",
    "the analyses are used to extract the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the proton and are extended to also extract electroweak parameters .",
    "the longitudinal polarisation of the lepton beam is defined as @xmath21 , where @xmath22(@xmath23 ) are the numbers of right(left)-handed leptons in the beam .",
    "the double - differential cross section for the neutral current process with polarised lepton beams is given by @xmath24 , \\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the qed coupling constant and @xmath26 and @xmath27 contain the unpolarised and polarised structure functions , respectively , such that at leading order in qcd @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the quark and antiquark pdfs , respectively , and the sums run over the five active quark flavours .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath33 coefficients contain the quark and lepton couplings to the photon and @xmath34 boson and are given by @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the electric charge in units of the positron charge and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the axial and vector couplings of the fermion @xmath40 .",
    "the quantity @xmath41 is proportional to the ratio of the @xmath3 and photon propagators @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mass of the @xmath3 boson and @xmath44 is the weinberg angle .",

    "in order to study the polarisation dependence of the nc dis cross sections the polarisation asymmetry may be formed by @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the mean polarisation values of the positively and negatively polarised data samples and @xmath54 are the measured @xmath18 cross sections . the asymmetry is shown in fig .

    "it can be seen that the values are non - zero and are well described by the standard model prediction evaluated using the zeus - jets  @xcite pdfs , confirming the expected polarisation dependence .",
    "the asymmetry is proportional to @xmath56 and therefore a direct measurement of parity violation at high @xmath55 .",

    "the data are compared to the standard model prediction evaluated using the zeus - jets , cteq6  @xcite and mrst04  @xcite pdfs .",
    "the standard model predicts a linear dependence on @xmath57 with the cross section becoming zero for right - handed ( left - handed ) electron ( positron ) beams , due to the chiral nature of the standard model .",
    "the predictions describe the data well .",
    "the neutral current cross sections give information on the quark couplings to the @xmath34 boson which appear in the coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath33 in sect .",

    "one can see that since @xmath58 is small and @xmath59 for the hera kinematic regime , the axial and vector couplings are dominant in the unpolarised @xmath60 and polarised @xmath61 terms , respectively .",
    "these electroweak parameters can be fitted simultaneously with the pdf parameters to perform a model - independent extraction  @xcite .",
    "the details of the fits for the pdfs follow the procedures in previous h1 and zeus publications  @xcite closely .",
    "the h1 fit includes inclusive nc and cc dis data over a large range in @xmath55 and @xmath62 .",
    "the zeus fit also includes jet cross - section data .",
    "these fits are extended to extract the quark couplings to the @xmath34 boson from the high-@xmath55 nc dis data .",
    "figure  [ f : pdfs ] shows the extracted pdf parameters compared to those from the zeus - jets fit.the pdfs are not significantly altered by the inclusion of electroweak parameters in the fit .",

    "the hera data are more sensitive to light quarks and thus the extracted couplings are compared with the corresponding light - quark extractions from lep  @xcite and cdf  @xcite .",
