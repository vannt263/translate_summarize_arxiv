    "one of the important processes at colliding beams is the bremsstrahlung . in the last years , besides of the well - known ordinary ( incoherent ) bremsstrahlung the coherent radiation at colliders has been widely discussed @xcite@xcite .    for definiteness",
    ", we consider the photon emission by electrons moving through a proton bunch .",
    "the ordinary bremsstrahlung dominates for large enough photon energies .",
    "if the photon energy becomes sufficiently small , the radiation is determined by the interaction of the electrons with the collective electromagnetic field of the proton bunch .",
    "it is known ( see , e.g.  77 in @xcite ) that the properties of this coherent radiation are quite different for electron deflection angles @xmath4 much larger or much smaller than the typical radiation angle @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electron lorentz factor .",
    "it is easy to estimate the ratio of these angles and @xmath7 are the numbers of electrons and protons in the bunches , @xmath8 is the longitudinal , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the horizontal and vertical transverse sizes of the proton bunch , @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the classical electron radius . ] .",
    "the electric * e * and magnetic * b * fields of the proton bunch are approximately equal in magnitude , @xmath13 .",
    "these fields are transverse and they deflect the electron into the same direction . in such fields the electron moves around a circumference of radius @xmath14 and gets the deflection angle @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "the radiation angle @xmath16 corresponds to a length @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of these angles is determined by the parameter @xmath18",
    "@xmath19    let us call the proton bunch _ long _ if @xmath20 .",
    "the corresponding radiation is usually called _",
    "beamstrahlung_. its properties are similar to those of the ordinary synchrotron radiation in an uniform magnetic field ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the proton bunch is called _ short _ if @xmath21 . in this case",
    "the electron trajectory remains practically unchanged during the collision . in some respect ,",
    "the radiation in the short bunch fields is similar to the ordinary bremsstrahlung , therefore we call it _ coherent bremsstrahlung _ ( cbs ) .",
    "it differs substantially from the beamstrahlung . in most of the colliders",
    "the ratio @xmath18 is either much smaller than one ( all the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and relativistic heavy - ion colliders , some @xmath24 colliders and b  factories ) or of the order of one ( e.g. lep , tristan ) .",
    "only linear @xmath24 colliders have @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the cbs has a very wide region of applicability .    in the following we discuss for our example the characteristic features of the cbs . in the usual bremsstrahlung",
    "the number of photons emitted by electrons is proportional to the number of electrons and protons : @xmath25 with decreasing photon energies the coherence length @xmath26 becomes comparable to the length of the proton bunch @xmath27 . at photon energies",
    "@xmath28 the radiation arises from the interaction of the electron with the proton bunch as a whole , but not with each proton separately .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 is called the critical photon energy .",
    "therefore the proton bunch is similar to a `` particle '' with the huge charge @xmath30 and with an internal structure described by the form factor of the bunch .",
    "the radiation probability is proportional to @xmath31 and the number of the emitted photons is given by @xmath32 the cbs differs strongly from the beamstrahlung in the soft part of its spectrum . as one can see from ( [ 3 ] ) the total number of cbs photons",
    "diverges in contrast to the beamstrahlung for which ( as well as for the synchrotron radiation ) the total number of photons is finite .",
    "it is useful to discuss shortly the experimental status and possible applications of this new kind of radiation .",
    "the ordinary bremsstrahlung is a well - known process .",
    "its large cross section and small angular spread of photons allows to use this radiation for measuring one of the important parameters of a collider  the luminosity ( for example , at hera and lep ) .",
    "the beamstrahlung has been observed in a single experiment at slc @xcite , and it has been demonstrated that it can be used for measuring the transverse bunch size .",
    "the main characteristics of the cbs have been calculated recently @xcite@xcite , and an experiment for its observation is planned in novosibirsk .",
    "it seems that cbs can be a potential tool for optimizing collisions and for measuring beam parameters .",
    "indeed , the bunch length @xmath27 can be found from the cbs spectrum , because the critical energy ( [ 233 ] ) is proportional to @xmath33 ; the horizontal transverse bunch size @xmath9 is related to the photon rate @xmath34 .",
    "besides , cbs may be very useful for a fast control over an impact parameter between the colliding bunch axes because a dependence of the photon rate on this parameter has a very specific behaviour .    as examples we give here the numbers of cbs photons for a single bunch collision at the @xmath22 collider lhc @xmath35 and at the b  factory kekb ( for @xmath36 gev ) @xmath37",
    "a classical approach to cbs was given in @xcite .",
    "a quantum treatment of cbs based on the rigorous concept of colliding wave packets and some applications of cbs to modern colliders were considered in @xcite@xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a new method to calculate the coherent bremsstrahlung at colliding beams based on the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) for the collective electromagnetic field of the oncoming bunch .",
    "this method is much more simple and transparent as that previously discussed .",
    "our method allows to calculate not only the classical radiation but to take into account quantum effects in cbs as well .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to applications in the classical limit .",
    "cbs is also interesting for relativistic heavy ion colliders , this topic will be discussed in a forthcoming publication @xcite .",
    "quantum effects for cbs and coherent pair production will be considered elsewhere @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we present a qualitative description of the effect . in the next section",
    "we derive the expressions for the collective field of a charged bunch as well as the number of equivalent photons .",
    "the luminosity and the polarization are discussed in section 4 followed by expressions for the spectrum in the next chapter . in section 6",
    "we apply the obtained formulae for cbs to the case of the @xmath0factory @xmath38 .",
    "we start with the standard calculation of the bremsstrahlung ( see @xcite ,  93 and  97 ) at @xmath39 collisions .",
    "this process is defined by the block diagram of fig .",
    "1a , which gives the radiation of the electron .",
    "we denote by @xmath40 the 4momentum of the virtual photon . the main contribution to the cross section",
    "is given by the region of small values @xmath41 .",
    "in this region the given reaction can be represented as a compton scattering of the equivalent photon ( radiated by the proton ) on the electron - fig .",
    "therefore , one obtains @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the number of equivalent photons ( ep ) generated by the proton @xmath44 where @xmath45 is determined by kinematics and @xmath46 is given by the dynamical cut  off of the compton cross section .",
    "therefore , the accuracy of this approximation is logarithmic .",
    "the compton cross section is of the order of @xmath47 with the minimal energy of the equivalent photon @xmath48 for the cross section ( [ 4.2 ] ) we obtain the estimate @xmath49    just as in the standard calculations we can estimate the number of cbs photons using epa . taking into account that the number of ep increases by a factor @xmath50 compared to the ordinary bremsstrahlung we get ( using @xmath51 ) @xmath52    since the impact parameter is of the order of @xmath53 we can rewrite this expression in another form @xmath54    to perform the integration over we estimate the main integration region as follows .",
    "the region of small impact paramaters @xmath55 and @xmath56 does not give a significant contribution because the electromagnetic field vanishes in the centre of a symmetric bunch .",
    "the region of large impact parameter @xmath57 and @xmath58 also does not contribute significantly since the proton bunch form factor decreases rapidly .",
    "therefore , the region which gives the main contribution is @xmath59 integrating over this region we obtain @xmath60 as a result the  effective cross section\"@xmath61 for cbs is of the order of @xmath62 in particular , for flat beams @xmath63 one has @xmath64    to illustrate the transition from the ordinary bremsstrahlung to cbs we present in fig .",
    "2 qualitatively the photon spectrum for the hera collider using the results of the last paper in @xcite .    in the region of @xmath65",
    "kev the number of photons dramatically increases by about 9 orders of magnitude .",
    "to define a coordinate frame we choose the @xmath66axis along the momentum of the initial electron , the @xmath67 and @xmath68axes in the transverse horizontal and vertical directions , respectively .",
    "the possible changes in the transverse sizes of the bunches during the collision are neglected .",
    "the electromagnetic field of a single proton moving with the constant velocity @xmath69 ( along @xmath70axis ) can be found for example in @xcite ,  64 .",
    "an expansion of this field in plane waves has the form @xmath71 from that expression one can see that the wave with the wave vector @xmath72 has the frequency @xmath73 for such a wave we put in correspondence an equivalent photon with the 4-momentum @xmath74 .",
    "now we consider the field of the whole bunch of protons .",
    "if the particle distribution does not change considerably during the collision , the proton density @xmath75 depends on @xmath76 and @xmath77 in the following combination only @xmath78    let us define the form factor of the proton bunch density at @xmath79 @xmath80 with its normalization @xmath81 we find the electric and magnetic fields of the proton bunch analogous to the calculation in the problem of  64 in @xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the same as in ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the spectral expansion of the proton bunch field contains the same frequencies ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "the spectral components of these fields are @xmath84 @xmath85    the form factor @xmath86 decreases rapidly when the components of @xmath72 become larger than the inverse proton bunch sizes .",
    "this means that the characteristic values of @xmath87 are much less than those of @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , one can omit the quantity @xmath89 in the integrand of ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "the electromagnetic field is dominated by its transverse components . for the transverse electric field",
    "@xmath90 its spectral component ( in which we omit an irrelevant phase factor exp@xmath91 ) has the form @xmath92 the field @xmath93 is real , hence @xmath94    having calculated the electromagnetic field of the proton bunch we calculate now the number of equivalent photons .",
    "the main idea of epa is that the electromagnetic interaction of an electron with the complicated field of the proton bunch is replaced by a more simple compton scattering of this electron with the flux of ep generated by the proton bunch .    to perform such a reduction ,",
    "let us remind a few facts about the collisions of two beams .",
    "it is well  known ( see , e.g.  12 in @xcite ) that a number of events for a process with the cross section @xmath95 is equal to @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the particle density of the @xmath98-th bunch , @xmath99 its velocity and @xmath100 the luminosity for a single head  on collision of the bunches . if these densities are of the form ( [ 9 ] ) @xmath101 one can replace @xmath102 by the new variables @xmath103 and integrate the expression ( [ 14 ] ) independently over these new variables . after these integrations the luminosity depends on the so called `` transverse densities '' @xmath104 the transverse density is equal to the total number of corresponding particles which cross a unit area around the impact parameter @xmath105 during the collision . as a result , the luminosity is @xmath106    now we can apply these formulae for cbs considering it as the scattering of electrons ( index 1 ) on the electromagnetic field of the proton bunch . replacing this field by the flux of ep ( index 2 ) with some spectrum",
    "we obtain the number of the produced cbs photons in the form @xmath107 here @xmath108 is the transverse electron density , @xmath109 the transverse density of ep with frequencies in the interval from @xmath110 to @xmath111 .",
    "@xmath112 denotes the differential luminosity for the collisions of electrons and ep and @xmath113 is the cross section of the compton scattering of the electron on the equivalent photon with the frequency @xmath114 .    in our case of ultrarelativistic protons ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) the electric and magnetic fields of the proton bunch ( [ 10 ] ) are approximately equal , transverse and orthogonal to each other @xmath117 therefore , they are similar to the usual fields describing waves of light .",
    "we obtain for the flux of the electromagnetic energy through the unit area around the impact parameter @xmath105 the known expression @xmath118 it can be rewritten as the total energy of ep crossing the same area during the collision @xmath119 using ( [ 13 ] ) we obtain the transverse density of the ep @xmath120 it should be noticed that the integration over @xmath121 can be extended to @xmath122 even at @xmath123 due to the proper behaviour of the form factor .",
    "it provides a high accuracy of our method compared to the usual weizscker ",
    "williams approximation ( discussed in section 2 ) which is correct only logarithmically .",
    "based on the obtained expression for the equivalent photon number we can calculate the luminosity @xmath124 . substituting ( [ 20 ] ) into ( [ 18 ] ) and performing the integration over @xmath125 we express the luminosity in the form @xmath126 with the function @xmath127 containing both the electron @xmath128 and the proton @xmath129 bunch form factors @xmath130 and @xmath131    it is useful to consider in detail the important case of gaussian beams since usually it is assumed that near the interaction point the particle distribution of the bunches is gaussian like . in this case",

    "in particular , the unit vector @xmath143 is the local polarization vector of ep , and the matrix @xmath144 is the local density matrix of ep . to obtain the average density matrix one has to integrate this local matrix with the luminosity ( [ 18 ] ) over the impact parameter and normalize it . with this procedure",

    "should be installed in the beam pipe",
    ". a serious problem for the observation and application of cbs may be the background due to synchrotron radiation on the external magnetic field of the accelerator .",
    "this background strongly depends on the details of the magnetic layout of the collider .",
    "if the electron bunch axis is shifted in the horizontal ( vertical ) direction by a distance @xmath196 ( @xmath197 ) from the positron bunch axis , the luminosity decreases exponentially ( see eq .",

    "the corresponding curve is presented in fig .",
    "3 .    the effect does not depend on the photon energy and it can be explained as follows . at @xmath202 a considerable portion of the electrons moves in the region of small impact parameters where the electric and magnetic fields of the positron bunch are small . for @xmath203 in the range of @xmath204",
    "the electrons fly through a stronger electromagnetic field of the positron bunch , therefore , the number of the emitted photons increases . at large @xmath197 ( for @xmath205 ,",
    "not shown in the fig . ) , the fields of the positron bunch are @xmath206 which leads to @xmath207 . in that region",
    "the number of emitted photons decreases , but very slowly compared with the luminosity .    shifting the electron bunch axis in the horizontal direction",
    ", the positron bunch fields immediately become weaker and the photon rate decreases ( see the dotted curve in fig .",
    "however , this decrease is not so strong as that of the luminosity .",
    "for example , @xmath208 at @xmath209 , but the luminosity drops by three orders of magnitude .",
    "such an unusual dependence of the cbs photon rate on @xmath210 can be used for a fast control over impact parameters between beams and over transverse beam sizes . for the case of long round bunches , such",
    "an experiment has already been successfully performed at the slc collider @xcite .      taking into account the angular distribution of the final photons in the compton cross section ( [ 268 ] ) , we obtain instead of eq .",

    "the equivalent photons become linearly polarized in the direction of the field . in general , the average degree of the linear polarization is defined by @xmath212 for identical beams and horizontal or vertical displacements one gets from ( [ 267],[23 ] ) that @xmath213 . in fig .  4 ,",
    "the average longitudinal polarization for @xmath1 is presented .",
