    "organic conductors offer intriguing subjects of low - dimensional correlated electron systems in which various electronic states emerge at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "in addition to the origin of such phases in thermal equilibrium condition , nonequilibrium properties induced by external stimuli have attracted much attention recently@xcite .",
    "for example , photoinduced phase transitions@xcite and nonlinear conduction phenomena@xcite , which have been observed mainly in mott insulators and charge - ordered compounds , have been intensively studied .    in the quasi - two - dimensional organic conductor @xmath0-(_meso_-dmbedt - ttf)@xmath1pf@xmath2@xcite [ abbreviated as @xmath0-(dmeet)@xmath1pf@xmath2 hereafter ] , nonlinear conduction has been observed in a charge - ordered insulating phase@xcite .",
    "the conduction layer of @xmath0-(dmeet)@xmath1pf@xmath2 consists of a weakly dimerized pair of neighboring donor molecules [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] and forms a 3/4-filled band .",
    "this compound shows a second - order metal - insulator transition at 90 k , where the peculiar checkerboard charge order ( cco ) occurs@xcite [ fig .",
    "1(b ) ] . this transition accompanies a structural distortion . under pressure ,",
    "the cco is readily suppressed and superconductivity with @xmath3 k appears@xcite .",
    "theoretically , yoshimi _",
    "et al._@xcite have investigated the superconductivity by using the random phase approximation for an extended hubbard model with on - site and nearest neighbor coulomb interactions .",
    "they show that the cco does not appear when they consider values of the coulomb interactions that are determined from the intermolecular distances and the effective molecular sizes .",
    "since their model has only electronic degrees of freedom , their result suggests that electron - lattice ( e - l ) interactions play an important role in stabilizing the cco .",
    "in fact , it is experimentally known that modulation of transfer integrals and bending of molecules occur at the transition triggered by the charge disproportionation@xcite .",
    "however , the effects of lattice degrees of freedom on the cco have not been studied so far .",
    "when the bias voltage is applied , @xmath0-(dmeet)@xmath1pf@xmath2 exhibits a negative differential resistance below 70 k , where the initial cco insulating state shows a steep decrease of the resistivity@xcite .",
    "moreover , in the current - voltage characteristics , a non - monotonic behavior of the voltage drop was observed .",
    "a recent raman spectroscopy measurement@xcite indicates that the cco melts by the bias .",
    "the time - resolved measurement shows a two - stepped sample voltage drop with a transient plateau , which suggests that there appears an electric - field - induced metastable state which is different from the normal metallic phase at high temperatures@xcite .",
    "such a new phase in nonequilibrium condition is also suggested in a photoinduced state of a quasi - one - dimensional organic conductor ( edo - ttf)@xmath1pf@xmath2 in which strong electron - phonon interactions play an important role in its charge - ordered ground state@xcite . in a recent femtosecond electron diffraction",
    "study@xcite , time - dependent structural changes after the photoexcitation have been monitored and the difference between the photoinduced transient state and the low - temperature charge - ordered state has been identified . in this context ,",
    "in addition to the origin of the cco in @xmath0-(dmeet)@xmath1pf@xmath2 , the mechanism of the nonlinear conduction and the identification of the phases appearing by melting the cco are intriguing subjects .    in this paper , we study the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of @xmath0-(dmeet)@xmath1pf@xmath2 .",
    "we use an extended hubbard model with two kinds of e - l couplings that are deduced from the experimental observations .",
    "the cco becomes the ground state by these lattice distortions since the coulomb interactions basically do not favor the checkerboard charge pattern .",
    "this state is similar to the ( 1100 ) charge order that has been discussed in quasi - one - dimensional systems by clay _",
    "et al._@xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "a concept of the paired - electron crystal@xcite that consists of pairs of charge - rich sites separated by pairs of charge - poor sites , has been proposed in order to understand the ground state of interacting quarter - filled systems with e - l couplings and frustration .",
    "we investigate nonlinear conduction by applying a bias to the cco insulating state .",
    "the bias induces a conductive state possessing a weak cco and partial lattice distortions , which is distinct from the insulating ground state .",
    "this indicates the appearance of a metastable state different from the metallic phase at high temperatures .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , the model hamiltonian for @xmath0-(dmeet)@xmath1pf@xmath2 and the methods of calculations are presented . in  3",

    "this is because the charge pattern of the intradimer pair should be r - p , and that of the second - nearest interdimer pair should also be r - p if we consider only the coulomb interactions that are determined by the intermolecular distances . however , the cco is of r - r - p - p type in which the two molecules connected by @xmath34 ( @xmath33 ) bonds become hole - rich ( hole - poor ) .",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate charge order and nonlinear conduction in a quasi - two - dimensional organic conductor @xmath0-(_meso_-dmbedt - ttf)@xmath1pf@xmath2 [ dmbedt - ttf = dimethylbis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene ] . within the hartree - fock approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we study effects of structural distortion on the experimentally observed checkerboard charge order and its bias - induced melting by using an extended hubbard model with peierls- and holstein - types of electron - lattice interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the structural distortion is important in realizing the charge order . </S>",
    "<S> the current - voltage characteristics obtained by a nonequilibrium green s function method indicate that a charge - ordered insulating state changes into a conductive state . </S>",
    "<S> although the charge order and lattice distortions are largely suppressed at a threshold voltage , they remain finite even in the conductive state . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the relevance of the results to experimental observations , especially to a possible bias - induced metastable state . </S>"
