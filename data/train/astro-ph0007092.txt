    "the shortest timescales in the variability of the compact objects always was a very interesting topic of x - ray astronomy .",
    "the efforts to measure the highest frequency in the variability of cyg x-1 can be traced back to rocket experiments in 70-ties ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "it was found that cyg x-1 demonstrates statistically significant variability of the x - ray flux at least up to frequencies of @xmath310 hz .",
    "since then cyg x-1 was extensively observed by various satellite missions searching for millisecond and submillisecond time scales variability ( heao-1 , see e.g. @xcite ; exosat , e.g. @xcite ; ginga , e.g. @xcite ) . at the present time the rossi x - ray timing explorer observatory ( rxte , @xcite ) is the most powerful experiment for the investigation of the short time scale x - ray flux variations .",
    "it combines high telemetry rate ( up to 512 kbps ) , large effective area of the detectors ( @xmath36400 @xmath12 in the soft x - ray band ) , high time resolution ( down to 1@xmath13sec ) and comparatively low deadtime distortions .",
    "the comparison of the characteristics of several x - ray experiments can be found in e.g. @xcite .",
    "the shape of the power density spectrum ( pds ) of cyg x-1 in its low / hard spectral state is well established ( in the range from @xmath14 to @xmath350100 hz ) since exosat observations  it can be roughly represented by a constant from @xmath15 hz up to some break frequency ( @xmath16 ) , then it steepens to the power law with index @xmath31 ( @xmath17 ) and then it breaks again to the power law with the index @xmath31.61.8 , @xmath18 ( see e.g. rxte results in @xcite )",
    ". short observations ( @xmath310 ksec ) of cyg x-1 by rxte / pca with high time resolution ( @xmath19s ) showed the absence of significant variability of cyg x-1 at time scales smaller than @xmath33 msec ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we report the systematic study of very high frequency variability of cyg x-1 in x - rays using large number of rxte observations ( total exposure time close to 190 ksec for the hard state and @xmath310 ksec for the soft state ) and carefully treating the deadtime effects .",
    "for our analysis we used the data from the proportional counter array ( pca ) aboard rxte . to study the source variability in the hard spectral state , we chose a compact group of observations of cyg x-1 performed on 1517 dec .",
    "1996 ( proposal p10236 ) with total exposure time of @xmath2080 ksec and 56 available observations of cyg x-1 from the proposal p30157 performed between dec .",
    "1997 and dec .",
    "1998 with total exposure time of @xmath21110 ksec .",
    "the soft spectral state data were accumulated on 418 june 1996 data ( proposal p10512 , see also @xcite ) with total exposure time of @xmath2110 ksec .",
    "all observations were performed with 5 pcus switched on .",
    "the power density spectra were calculated from the light curves with the bin duration equal to the intrinsic time resolution of the data ( @xmath22s@xmath23s in proposals p10236 and p10512 and @xmath24s@xmath25s in proposal p30157 ) .",
    "some deviations from the noise level predicted by the pca dead time models are observed in the power spectra constructed in the pca energy sub - bands with the amplitude of @xmath26 ( rms / mean)@xmath27/hz .",
    "we therefore followed recommendations of the rxte gof and analyzed the light curves in the total pca energy band , where these deviations seem to be considerably less significant ( william zhang , private communication ) .",
    "the power spectra calculated for individual time series were normalized to units of squared fractional rms ( @xcite ) @xmath28 and averaged . in the above formula",
    "@xmath29 is the fourier amplitude at the frequency @xmath30 ; @xmath31 is total observed number of counts in the time series ; @xmath32  averaged observed count rate for the time series .",
    "note that the ideal poissonian noise component is already subtracted , therefore @xmath33 for a poissonian distribution of counts in the time series .    in a real detector",
    "various effects could lead to modification of the poissonian noise level by an amount @xmath34 .",
    "two major effects contribute to @xmath34 in the case of pca detector : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a modification of the noise level due to counts dead time , @xmath37  additional noise component resulting from vetoing of the pca detectors by the very large events ( vle ) .      to the first approximation the very large events lead to appearance of an additional ( positive ) component ( @xcite ) @xmath46 ^ 2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath47  the duration of the vle window , @xmath48 - the vle count rate in one pcu .",
    "note that the above expression does not include the binning and sampling effects and is valid in the limit @xmath49 .",

    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) respectively .",
    "the factor @xmath56 accounts for the fact that the count streams from @xmath53 independent units were merged together .",
    "the factor @xmath57 accounts for reduction of the observed count rate due to very large events .",
    "this formula is valid under the following conditions : @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "it is important to stress out that in the adopted dead time model @xmath52 is the the _ total observed _ count rate of the events causing the dead time @xmath41 ( as opposite to the observed count rate in the analyzed time series ) . in the case of pca detector",
    "it should include total good xenon rate , propane and remaining counts .",
    "we also note that for sufficiently small count rates , @xmath6135 kcnts / s / pcu dependence of @xmath54 and , therefore , of @xmath34 upon @xmath40 vanishes . the model has been tested on a series of monte - carlo simulations and has proven to be sufficiently accurate in the parameters range of interest .",

    "we therefore followed the approach adopted by @xcite and fitted the power spectra at high frequencies , @xmath81 hz , with the model for the noise component plus the model for the source component leaving the noise model parameters free .",
    "the source contribution in this particular case was modeled as a superposition of two lorentzians representing khz qpos .",
    "this approach has a disadvantage that it requires a priory assumptions about the shape of the power spectrum of the source .",

    "for observation # 3 we fixed parameters @xmath82 and @xmath47 because the limited frequency range of the power spectrum ( @xmath834096 hz ) does not allow us to constrain their values from the fit . from fig .",
    "[ scox1_ds2 ] , [ scox1_ds1 ] and [ scox1_qpos ] one can see that with appropriate tuning of the parameters the adopted noise model is capable to reproduce the observed shape of the noise component",
    ".    in general the best fit parameters of the noise level model ( table [ dt_params ] ) look reasonable and are close to the expected values .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath47 , in observation # 2 is by @xmath84 higher than the preflight value .",
    "it is possible , however , that the duration of the vle window differs from the preflight values ( alan smale , private communication ) .",
    "the most apparent difference is a large , by a factor of @xmath9 , discrepancy between the best fit and observed total count rate .",
    "but we should note that the observed goodxenon count rate is much closer to the best fit @xmath52 value ( see table [ dt_params ] ) .",
    "the reason of this discrepancy is not clear , it might be due to unaccounted processes in the pca detectors at high count rates .",
    "we note however , that dependence of the noise component ( in units of squared fractional rms ) on the total count rate is a specific feature of a non - paralyzable dead time process at sufficiently high count rates . at lower count rate ( @xmath8530005000 cnts",
    "/ s ) and in particular in the case of cyg x-1 ( @xmath861000 - 1500 cnts / s ) this dependence vanishes .",
    "we adopted the noise level model described in the previous section for the subsequent analysis of the cyg x-1 data .",
    "since the cyg x-1 observations were performed with time resolution coarser than @xmath87sec , the photon dead time and duration of the vle window are not constrained by the data .",
    "we fixed them at the best fit values determined from the sco x-1 data : @xmath88s and @xmath89s .",
    "as mentioned above , at the count rates typical for cyg x-1 , @xmath8610001500 cnts / s , the noise level does not depend on the count rate .",

    "the only free parameter of the noise level model was @xmath80 .",
    "similarly to the procedure applied to the sco x-1 data , we included the source component into the model .",

    "we used the high frequency part of the power spectra , from 100 hz up to the nyquist frequency , for the fits .",

    "the intrinsic variability of the source has been statistically significantly detected up to frequencies of @xmath3150300 hz ( fig .",
    "[ p10236_noise][soft_noise ] ) with the fractional rms amplitude in frequency band @xmath3100 - 400 hz of @xmath97% ( hard spectral state ) and @xmath212% ( soft state ) .    in order to increase statistics we averaged all the hard state data increasing the total exposure time up to @xmath98 ksec .",
    "the power law approximation of the averaged power spectrum above 100 hz gives the power law index of @xmath99 .",
    "the power law approximation of the same data in the 2060 hz frequency range results in @xmath100 , although the pds clearly has a more complicated shape than a power law ( fig.[outcome ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that we detected statistically significant steepening of the power spectrum of cyg x-1 in the hard state at the frequency of @xmath34080 hz .",
    "note , that some indication of such steepening can be found in @xcite , although short duration of the used observations ( @xmath101 ksec ) was not sufficient to study the high frequencies in detail . in order to illustrate the high frequency behaviour of the power spectra , we plot in fig.[outcome ] the power spectra multiplied by @xmath102 . as it can be seen from fig.[outcome ] the particular shape of the rollover above 100 hz",
    "is not significantly constrained by the data .",
    "assuming that power spectrum continues with the same slope to the higher frequencies an observatory of the extra / laste class ( effective area @xmath103 m@xmath27 , @xcite ) would be able to detect statistically significant signal up to several khz in @xmath3tens of ksec exposure time and help us to say something more about the exact shape of the rollover of the pds .",
    "the 2@xmath104 upper limit on the amplitude of a possible qpo component ( lorentz profile with quality @xmath105 ) in the 500 - 2000 hz frequency range in the hard state power spectrum is @xmath32% for @xmath106 and @xmath30.9% for @xmath107 .",
    "these upper limits were obtained using the observations from the propsal p10236 performed on 15 - 17 dec .",
    "1996 in which the shape of the power density at the lower frequency did not vary significantly .",
    "the upper limit on the continuum noise component at the high frequency is somewhat more difficult to estimate .",
    "a statistical ( @xmath108 ) error on the fractional rms in the 500 - 2000 hz for the sum of all hard state observations is @xmath109 . assuming that the noise level model is exact the upper limit on the fractional rms would coincide with the above number .",
    "however , as we mentioned in the previous section a weak and very flat source power spectrum component might be not detected given the procedure used to determine the instrumental noise level .",
    "we analized @xmath3190 ksec of observations of cyg x-1 in the low / hard state and reanalyzed @xmath310 ksec of high / soft state observations .",
    "we detected statistically significant variability up to frequencies of @xmath3300400 hz with the fractional rms amplitude in the 100400 hz frequency range @xmath213% in the hard state and @xmath212% in the soft state .",
    "the @xmath108 upper limits on the fractional rms amplitude of a qpo feature with lorentzian profile in the 5002000 hz frequency range are @xmath32% for @xmath110 and @xmath30.9% for @xmath111 in the hard state and 2.5% ( @xmath110 ) and 1.5% ( @xmath111 ) in the soft state . assuming that the model for the instrumental noise level is exact , the @xmath108 upper limits on the continuum variability in the 4002000 hz frequency range are @xmath31% and @xmath6% for the hard and soft state respectively .",
    "we detected statistically significant steepening of the power spectrum in the hard state at frequencies @xmath112 hz . the power law approximation to the spectrum at frequencies higher than @xmath380100 hz gives the slope of @xmath1132.32.4 . in the soft state the slope of power spectrum changes from @xmath8 to @xmath9 at the frequency of @xmath10 hz without any evidence of further steepening up to the frequency of @xmath114 hz .",
    "thus the sensitivity and time resolution of the rxte allow one to probe interesting range of the variability time scales for accreting black holes .",
    "several characteristic frequencies fall approximately in this range .",
    "first of all the frequency of rotation at the last marginally stable orbit for the non - rotating ( schwarzschild ) black hole is @xmath115 hz .",
    "for the maximally rotating kerr black hole this frequency ranges from @xmath31200 hz to @xmath116 hz for the co - rotating and counter  rotating orbits respectively .",
    "if keplerian rotation itself makes significant contribution to the variability of the x  ray flux ( e.g. due to the doppler shift and boosting of the emission from the `` hot spots '' in the disk ) this difference should be manifested in this frequency range ( sunyaev 1972 ) .",
    "secondly typical sound crossing time of the disk height ( in the case of optically thick geometrically thin standard accretion disk ) corresponds to the frequency of hundreds of hz .",
    "if strong turbulence is present in the accretion flow as anticipated by the most popular theoretical models ( see e.g. @xcite for review ) then it may affect the variability at higher frequencies .",
    "the dependence of the amplitude of variations on the frequency is then a valuable tool to study the turbulence in the accretion flow .",
    "thirdly light crossing time of the central region @xmath117 corresponds to the frequencies of the order of khz .",
    "the light crossing time for the region of the main energy release ( @xmath118 1020 @xmath119 ) corresponds to the frequencies of 300500 hz . the character of the the variability may change drastically around this frequency or ( e.g. in the comptonization models involving multiple scatterings of the photons ) at a several times lower frequencies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    the rxte data ( i ) demonstrate that power specifically associated with any of these characteristic frequencies is not large ( see given above upper limits on the narrow features on the pds in the frequency range from 5002000 hz ) ",
    "i.e. there are no `` resonances '' at these frequencies , ( ii ) limits the total power associated with high frequency variability ( from 400 hz to 2000 hz ) to a percent level , ( iii ) show that in the hard state of the source prominent , previously unknown , break in the pds occurs at the frequency of @xmath3 70 hz , ( iv ) extend the range of significantly detected variations up to the frequencies of @xmath3200300 hz .",
    "the theoretical models of the accretion onto the black holes are now to be tested against these results .",
    "the study of the high frequency noise might become an additional tool to distinguish black holes from weakly magnetized neutron stars ( sunyaev & revnivtsev 2000 ) .",
    "in the subsequent publication ( revnivtsev et al .",
    "2000 , in preparation ) we perform similar analysis for the accreting neutron stars .    the authors thank rashid sunyaev for numerous discussions , william zhang for helpful discussions of pca deadtime , alan smale and keith jahoda for the useful comments on the pca operations .",
