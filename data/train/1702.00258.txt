    "although pbtase@xmath0 was discovered several decades ago , @xcite its electronic structure and physical properties have only been studied in detail over the past few years .",
    "@xcite structurally , pbtase@xmath0 can be thought of as alternating stacking of hexagonal tase@xmath0 and pb layers with the @xmath9 space group .",
    "the crystal structure of pbtase@xmath0 is non - centrosymmetric . @xcite initially , only the values of resistivity and hall coefficient at 300 k of a pressed powder pellet of pbtase@xmath0 and resistive onset of superconductivity at @xmath10 k were reported .",
    "@xcite    recently pbtase@xmath0 was identified as a topological , nodal semimetal with strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xcite its superconducting transition temperature in polycrystalline samples @xcite and in single crystals @xcite based on thermodynamic and transport measurements was established to be @xmath11 k. thermal conductivity and london penetration depth measurements @xcite suggested a nodeless superconducting gap structure for this material .",
    "low temperature magnetoresistance was found to be relatively high , anisotropic , and sublinear in magnetic field ; the anisotropy of the upper critical field , @xmath12 , from the resistivity measurements was reported to be temperature dependent , with the values of @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite    the complex , non - trivial band structure of pbtase@xmath0 @xcite suggests possible sensitivity of its physical properties to applied pressure .",
    "indeed , a non - monotonic , v - shaped , pressure dependence of @xmath8 was observed in a polycrystalline sample of pbtase@xmath0 that had a relatively broad resistive superconducting transition .",
    "@xcite this behavior of @xmath14 was suggested to result from a lifshitz transition under pressure .",
    "non - monotonic behavior of @xmath8 as a function of pressure has been observed in a number of materials , including elements .",
    "@xcite a lifshitz transition ( a change of the fermi surface topology ) @xcite has been invoked to explain such evolution of @xmath8 with pressure .",
    "@xcite recently , for complex superconductors , other possible causes for non - monotonic behavior of @xmath8 under pressure were discussed and studied , e.g. crossing long range magnetic order phase lines in @xmath15 phase diagrams @xcite or pressure - induced changes in superconducting pairing symmetry or gap structure .",
    "@xcite    to clarify the intrinsic @xmath14 behavior of pbtase@xmath0 under pressure and to better address the physics associated with this behavior , in this work we perform measurements of in - plane resistivity of high quality pbtase@xmath0 single crystals under pressures up to @xmath16 gpa in zero and applied magnetic field .",
    "in addition to @xmath14 , and pressure dependence of the normal state resistivity , these measurements allow us to follow the evolution of the upper critical field , @xmath17 near the @xmath18 ( that was instrumental in e.g. studies of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 and fese @xcite ) and of the low temperature , normal state magnetoresistance .",
    "additionally , motivated by the low temperature results discussed below , ambient pressure x - ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements at elevated temperatures were performed .",
    "experimental studies were complimented by the first - principles calculations of the stability of different crystallographic phases under pressure .",
    "pbtase@xmath0 single crystals were grown by chemical vapor transport , using pbcl@xmath0 as a transport agent .",
    "more details about the synthesis are presented in ref . .",
    "the quality of the samples was attested by rather high residual resistivity ratios , @xmath19 and sharp superconducting transitions in zero field .",
    "the electrical contacts for standard 4-probe ac resistivity measurements were made using pt wires and combination of du pont 4929n silver paste and epo - tek h20e silver epoxy .",
    "the current was flowing in the @xmath20 plane and magnetic field was applied along the @xmath21-axis .",
    "the resistivity measurements at ambient and high pressure were performed in a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms-9 ) . for resistivity measurements under pressure a be - cu / ni - cr - al hybrid piston cylinder pressure cell similar to that used in ref . was used .",
    "a 40 : 60 mixture of light mineral oil and n - pentane was used as a pressure medium .",
    "this medium solidifies at room temperature at @xmath22 gpa @xcite , well above the pressure range used in this work .",
    "the pressure at room temperature was evaluated using manganin resistive gauge , whereas at low temperatures the superconducting transition of pure pb @xcite was used to determine pressure .",
    "additionally , low - field dc magnetization under pressure down to 1.8 k was measured in a quantum design magnetic property measurement system ( mpms-5 ) squid magnetometer using a commercial , hmd , be - cu piston - cylinder pressure cell @xcite . in these measurements",

    "a stack of single crystals was oriented with @xmath23 .",
    "an additional set of resistivity measurements was performed under he - gas pressure .",
    "four - point ac electrical resistivity measurements were carried out simultaneously on two pbtase@xmath0 crystals with approximate dimensions 0.5@xmath240.1@xmath240.05 mm@xmath25 to hydrostatic pressures as high as 0.37 gpa in a he - gas high - pressure system .",
    "an excitation current of 1 ma ( rms ) at 17 hz was applied using a keithley 6221 constant ac / dc current source and the small voltage detected by a stanford research sr830 digital lock - in amplifier .",
    "experiments were carried out both at constant temperature with varying pressures or at constant pressure with varying temperatures .",
    "a janis supervaritemp cryostat was used to reach temperatures below the ambient .    to generate hydrostatic pressure",
    "the samples were placed in the 7 mm diameter bore of a be - cu high - pressure cell ( unipress , warsaw ) connected to a three - stage harwood compressor system .",
    "he gas from the compressor is fed into the pressure cell via a 3 mm od / 0.3 mm i d be - cu capillary tube .",
    "a calibrated digital manganin gauge at ambient temperature ( harwood model dj-320/42 ) accurately determines the pressure .",
    "a sizable  dead volume \" at ambient temperature reduces the decrease of he - gas pressure on cooling from ambient to low temperatures .",
    "high temperature x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was performed using a panalytical xpert pro xrd system with an anton paar htk-1200n furnace under flowing helium after evacuating and backfilling the system with he .",
    "larger single crystals were ground to a few tens of @xmath26 m but retained their micaceous morphology hence the xrd only exhibited ( 00l ) reflections . copper and cobalt radiation was used .",
    "heating rates were either 3 k / min or 5 k / min .",
    "since the xrd was not able to resolve changes of the _ in - plane _ lattice with heating , additional studies using transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) at different temperatures using a fei tecnai g2 f200 instrument operating at 200 kv were performed . for these studies",
    "a single crystal was thinned via ar ion milling .",
    "the thin region was co - planar with the basal planes , providing an orthogonal view of the lattice expansion on heating compared to the xrd results , i.e. , the ( hk0 ) reflections .",

    "the generalized - gradient approximation parameterized for solids ( pbesol ) @xcite was used for the exchange - correlation energy functional .",
    "spin - orbit coupling was included in the calculations .",
    "the energy cutoff is 320 ev and the monkhorst - pack s scheme @xcite was used for brillouin zone sampling with a @xmath28-point mesh of @xmath29 for the ground state @xmath9 structure and equivalent @xmath28-point meshes for other structures .",
    "all crystal structures were fully relaxed until the forces on each atom were smaller than 0.01 ev /   and external pressure was smaller than 0.1 gpa .",
    "ambient pressure resistivity data ( fig . [ f1]a ) are grossly consistent with those reported in refs . .",
    "although there is a region of @xmath30 behavior in resistivity , it does not persist to the temperatures close to the superconducting transition , where the behavior with temperature to higher power ( close to 4 ) was observed ( fig .",
    "[ f1]b ) . the upper critical field , @xmath31 , was determined from electrical transport and magnetization measurements ( see appendix a for details ) . here , as well as in the literature , @xcite",
    "there is an apparent discrepancy between the results of thermodynamic and transport measurements .    turning to superconducting properties under pressure ,",
    "the evolution of the superconducting transition under pressure , as measured by resistivity and low field magnetization , is presented in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] . in the resistivity",
    "measurements the transitions at all pressures , other than 0.24 gpa , are sharp . from both measurements",
    "it appears that the @xmath14 has a step - like behavior . indeed , as it is seen in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] , both measurements result in consistent data , and a clear , sharp step in @xmath14 is observed at about 0.25 gpa .",
    "the broad , two - step - like resistive transition at 0.24 gpa corresponds to this apparent phase boundary .",
    "normal state resistivity at 5 k , just like @xmath8 , has a step - like behavior ( fig .",
    "the initial slope of transport @xmath31 ( see appendix b ) has a step - like change at @xmath32 gpa as well .",
    "furthermore , the normal state properties show discontinuities at @xmath33 gpa . the field dependent magnetoresistance data ( fig .",
    "[ f7 ] ) clearly fall on two different manifolds , for @xmath34 gpa and @xmath35 gpa , that have different functional dependencies of @xmath36 .",
    "a careful look at zero field , temperature - dependent resistivity data taken in the piston - cylinder cell at small , from 0.05 to 0.39 gpa at room temperature , pressures ( fig .",
    "[ f9 ] ) reveals a clear , hysteretic in temperature , sharp transition .",
    "although qualitatively these data point to an additional phase line , probably of the structural transition , that has a very steep pressure dependence , a quantitative analysis of these data is hindered by an experimental issue associated with a use of piston - cylinder pressure cells over an extended temperature range .",
    "due to differential thermal contraction of the materials of the cell and the medium , the pressure inside the cell decreases on cooling @xcite .",
    "this pressure drop depends on multiple factors , including the cell materials and design , medium and the pressure range . at low pressures ,",
    "even when using manganin as a room temperature pressure gauge and pb as a low temperature pressure gauge , the evaluation of pressure at intermediate temperatures has substantial error bars .    to address the pressure dependence of the apparent structural transition in a quantitative manner , a set of measurements in a he gas system",
    "was performed ( fig .",
    "[ f10 ] ) .",
    "the hysteretic nature of the transition is seen both in temperature sweeps and pressure sweeps .",
    "these signatures are sharp and well defined . from the pressure sweeps ( fig . [ f10](b ) ) it is seen that ( a ) at lower temperatures the transition shifts to higher pressures ; ( b ) as has been seen in figure [ f9 ] , the size of the resistance jump becomes smaller at lower temperatures and it appears not to be detected anymore in the pressure sweep at @xmath37 k. fig .",
    "[ f11 ] shows that both absolute and relative resistance jump decrease at lower temperatures , and it is not clear if at 50 k the jump disappears , or just becomes on the level of the noise in the data .",
    "the pressure dependence of the apparent structural transition measured in gas pressure system is presented in fig .",
    "the second order polynomial fits to the @xmath38 data extrapolate to 0.25 gpa for the decreasing temperature manifold to intercept the @xmath39 k axis . in a similar manner ,",
    "both manifolds extrapolate to @xmath2 k at ambient pressure .",
    "this is a rather rough extrapolation , additional , preferably structural , data at high temperatures are required to verify the nature of the transition .    in situ xrd",
    "was performed at different elevated temperatures . as mentioned above , the pbtase@xmath0 powder retained the micaceous morphology , so only ( 00l ) reflections could be detected and followed as a function of temperature .",
    "the experimental results are shown in fig .",
    "the ( 00l ) reflections show a clear , step - like , contraction in the @xmath21-axis lattice on heating which is reversible upon cooling .",
    "the temperature of this transition is @xmath40 k.    to resolve changes of the in - plane lattice with heating , tem measurements were performed ( fig .",
    "[ f16 ] ) .",
    "the thin region studied with tem was co - planar with the basal planes , providing an orthogonal view of the lattice expansion on heating compared to the xrd results , i.e. , the ( hk0 ) reflections .",
    "continuous recording of the selected area diffraction was obtained on cooling .",
    "the sample was slowly cooled over the temperature range of @xmath41 k to @xmath42 k at @xmath43 k / min .",
    "an abrupt contraction of the basal plane lattice of @xmath44 occurred @xmath2 k. no other changes in the diffraction pattern were observed , indicating that like in the xrd there is a discrete change in the cell parameters occurring at @xmath2 to 430 k but no obvious change in the space group ( fig .",
    "[ f16 ] , lower panels ) .",
    "tem results suggest that the basal plane undergoes a normal expansion with heating and contraction on cooling in contrast to the xrd results which shows a large contraction in the @xmath21-axis at @xmath2 k.    aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy using a fei titan themis 300 cubed 300 stem / tem shows that the room temperature atomic decoration is fully consistent with the space group # 187 , @xmath9 , ( fig .",
    "[ f17 ] ) .",
    "the image suggest minimal chemical disorder .",
    "there is a rather large gap between the pb layers relative to the ta / se inner layers which form an open network of edge sharing prisms .",
    "this large gap between these layers maybe responsible for the lattice contraction in the @xmath21-axis with heating .    altogether on heating through the structural transition at @xmath45 k the @xmath46-axis increases by @xmath47 , whereas the @xmath21-axis decreases by @xmath48 , leading to a decrease of the unit cell volume by @xmath49 .",
    "based on the data discussed above , the pressure - temperature the phase diagram for pbtase@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ f13 ] ) appears to have two superconducting phases with the boundary between them defined by a structural phase transition that has extremely steep pressure dependence . since the normal state resistivity , magnetoresistance and the initial slopes of @xmath50 are different in these two phases ,",
    "clearly , the electronic structure is affected .",
    "a bloch - grneisen fit of resistivity ( over the 50 k - 300 k temperature range ) ( fig .",
    "[ f14 ] ) .",
    "suggests that as a result of the structural phase transition the debye temperature increases , so that the lattice becomes stiffer .",
    "this is largely consistent with an overall decrease of the unit cell volume at ambient pressure on heating through the transition . despite this",
    ", @xmath8 is lower in the new structural phase , suggesting that either the change in the electronic subsystem is the dominant contribution to the @xmath8 decrease , or that the in - plane phonons are more important for superconductivity than the out - of - plane phonons .",
    "the latter hypothesis is in agreement with the observed large gaps between the layers ( fig .",
    "[ f17 ] ) .    since available experimental techniques",
    "do not allow for an unambiguous identification of the high pressure ( high temperature ) phase , we have performed first - principles calculations that address relative stability of several related hexagonal phases under pressure .",
    "in addition to the known @xmath9 structure of pbtase@xmath0 , we consider 3 other low - energy structures ( within 50.0 mev / atom with respect to that of the @xmath9 structure ) coming from our crystal structure optimization scheme with one and two formula units and hexagonal symmetry constraints ( fig . [ f18 ] ) .",
    "these structures can also be obtained through modification of the @xmath9 structure .",
    "the @xmath51 structure can be obtained from the @xmath9 structure by moving the pb atom from the @xmath3-wyckoff position to the @xmath52-wyckoff position .",
    "similarly the @xmath53 structure can be obtained by shifting the pb from the @xmath3-wyckoff position to the @xmath4-wyckoff position . by doubling unit cell of the @xmath9 structure along the @xmath21-axis lattice vector and",
    "then moving the upper half of unit cell by 1/3 along the long diagonal of the basal plane @xmath54 , the @xmath55 structure can be obtained .",
    "the @xmath51 and @xmath53 structures are in @xmath9 space group symmetry whereas the @xmath55 structure is in @xmath56 space group symmetry .",
    "the lattice parameters and wyckoff positions of these structures are given in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the lateral lattice constants of these 3 structures are similar to that of the @xmath9 structure , but their lattice constants along the @xmath21 direction ( @xmath57 for the @xmath55 structure ) are smaller than that of the @xmath9 structure by 0.534  , 0.487  , and 0.246   respectively , where the @xmath51 structure has the shortest lattice parameter @xmath21 .    in order to compare with experimental xrd results , we simulated the xrd ( 0 0 l)-peaks of all four structures considered .",
    "it is interesting to note that although the @xmath55 structure has a doubled unit cell along the @xmath21-direction in comparison with other structures , it shows only ( 0 0 l)-peaks with even - l . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f19 ] , the xrd ( 0 0 l)-peaks versus @xmath58-spacing patterns from all four structures are very similar . in figure [ f19 ]",
    "the peak indexes of the @xmath55 structure are ( 0 0 2l ) of the labeled ones and the diffraction intensities of all structures are normalized by the intensity of their ( 0 0 2)-peak .",
    "figure [ f20 ] shows the relative formation enthalpies of different pbtase@xmath0 structures as a function of pressure with respect to that of the @xmath9 structure . at zero and low pressure ,",
    "the stable structure is the @xmath9 structure .",
    "as the pressure is increased , the @xmath53 structure becomes more stable with a structural transition from the @xmath9 to the @xmath53 at 3 gpa . at ambient conditions ,",
    "the formation energy of the @xmath53 structure is 25.9 mev / atom higher than that of the @xmath9 ground state structure .",
    "this energy difference is about the room temperature thermal energy .",
    "we note that the @xmath55 structure is lower in energy than the @xmath53 structure at ambient conditions .",
    "however , the @xmath53 structure becomes more stable than the @xmath55 structure when the external pressure is greater than 2.7 gpa , which is just below the transition pressure from the @xmath9 structure to the @xmath53 structure .",
    "thus these calculations suggest that the experimentally observed high pressure ( high temperature ) structure is the @xmath53 structure .",
    "we would like to note that structural transition pressure from the dft calculations is higher than that observed in experiment .",
    "this discrepancy is probably due to the systematic error in dft calculation of pressure .",
    "for example , in the literature the predicted structural transition pressure of si from cubic diamond ( si - i ) to - sn ( si - ii ) phase can be several gpa off the experimentally observed value , depending on exchange - correlation functional used.@xcite but the sequence of phase transition , i.e. si - i to si - ii to si - v to si - vi to si - vii , from dft calculation is consistent with experiment .",
    "@xcite + _ to summarize _ , pbtase@xmath0 exhibits a structural , sharp , first order , phase transition at a very moderate pressure of @xmath1 gpa at low temperatures .",
    "pbtase@xmath0 has a @xmath59 k / gpa making it one of the more pressure sensitive transitions found in inorganic compounds .",
    "the structural phase transition line extends to @xmath2 k at ambient pressure as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy and x - ray diffraction at elevated temperatures . upon transition to the new phase ( on increase of temperature at ambient pressure )",
    "the @xmath21-axis decreases and the @xmath46-axis increases , resulting in a slight , @xmath49 decrease of the unit cell volume .",
    "the new , high temperature / high pressure phase has similar crystal structure . as suggested by the first - principles calculations , in this structure pb shifts from @xmath3 to @xmath4 wyckoff position with ta and se positions remaining the same .",
    "the superconductivity appears to be robust , it persists through the structural phase transition into the other phase with slight , step - like decrease of @xmath8 .",
    "ambient pressure , low temperature resistivity , @xmath60 , measured in constant fields and @xmath61 , measured at constant temperatures , are shown in figs . [ f2]a ,",
    "b . two criteria , onset and offset ( see fig .",
    "[ f2]b ) were used to evaluate the @xmath12 .",
    "additionally , zero - field - cooled magnetization was measured in different applied fields ( fig . [ f2]c ) and @xmath31 was determined from these measurements as well .",
    "the summary of these results , the ambient pressure @xmath31 for @xmath23 inferred from electrical transport and magnetization measurements are shown in fig .",
    "[ f2]d and are compared to the literature data @xcite .",
    "the resistively determined @xmath31 is comparable with the literature data ( with possible contributions to the difference from the sample shape and slight mis - orientation ) .",
    "similarly , results from magnetization are very close to the published upper critical field determined from specific heat .",
    "however , both in the literature @xcite and in this work , even though the low field / zero field @xmath8 values are quite similar , @xmath31 from electrical transport [ @xmath62 and thermodynamic [ @xmath63 measurements are noticeably different .",
    "the origin of this difference is not clear at this point .",
    "the temperature - dependent upper critical field for @xmath23 was measured resistively as a function of pressure ( fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) . whereas there is an apparent difference between thermodynamic and transport @xmath12 values ( see above ) , as well as an upward curvature of @xmath31 and the limited range of the data for the higher pressures",

    "<S> transport and magnetic studies of pbtase@xmath0 under pressure suggest existence of two superconducting phases with the low temperature phase boundary at @xmath1 gpa that is defined by a very sharp , first order , phase transition . the first order phase transition line can be followed via pressure dependent resistivity measurements , and is found to be near 0.12 gpa near room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> transmission electron microscopy and x - ray diffraction at elevated temperatures confirm that this first order phase transition is structural and occurs at ambient pressure near @xmath2 k. the new , high temperature / high pressure phase has a similar crystal structure and slightly lower unit cell volume relative to the ambient pressure , room temperature structure . </S>",
    "<S> based on first - principles calculations this structure is suggested to be obtained by shifting the pb atoms from the @xmath3 to @xmath4 wyckoff position without changing the positions of ta and se atoms . </S>",
    "<S> pbtase@xmath0 has an exceptionally pressure sensitive , structural phase transition with @xmath5 k / gpa near 4 k , this first order transition causes an @xmath6 k ( @xmath7 ) step - like decrease in @xmath8 as pressure is increased through 0.25 gpa . </S>"
