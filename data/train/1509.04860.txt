    "* detailed theoretical study of nonlinear magnetization dynamics is rarely to be accomplished in closed analytical form , however before we present the results of our numerical simulations we elaborate a simple toy model which allows us to include all relevant interactions and make predictions which will be shown to be qualitatively correct .",
    "we examine the behaviour of a quasi - one - dimensional ferromagnet with lack of inversion symmetry located along @xmath7axis placed in the transverse magnetic field @xmath8 : the hamiltonian ( per a unit volume ) of such a system    @xmath9    is known to incorporate the terms due to exchange @xmath10 , dzyaloshinskii - moriya @xmath11 , and zeeman @xmath12 interaction .",
    "we have also included @xmath13 , a component which stands for easy - plane ( @xmath14plane ) anisotropy in the expression ( [ magnen ] ) . in the following",
    "we assume the magnetisation is determined by a vector field @xmath15 , so that @xmath16 , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are coordinates of space and time ; the parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 represent exchange and dm couplings , and magnetic anisotropy respectively . in the absence of an external field dm favours the formation of a spiral structure along the @xmath7axis , which is incommensurate with the underlying crystalline structure , whereas the magnetic field @xmath22 , applied in the @xmath23direction , tends to align the spins in this direction .",
    "the delicate interplay between these two interactions may lead to the formation of elongated domains of width @xmath24 ( see below in the text ) in which magnetisation is uniform .",
    "there exists a critical field @xmath25 , where as long as @xmath26 the system is collinear , ferromagnetic .",
    "the vector field @xmath15 allows a parametrisation with polar @xmath27 and azimuthal @xmath28 angles : @xmath29 .",
    "there are many magnetic materials where the magnetic anisotropy is very high , so that @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "for such systems one can use @xmath31 , where @xmath32 . if this is the case , the landau - lifshitz equation , combined with the hamiltonian in eqn.[magnen ] , leads to the following equations for the leading order terms for @xmath33 :    @xmath34    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "note that substituting ( [ ll1 ] ) into ( [ ll2 ] ) and introducing dimensionless variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 one arrives at the celebrated sine - gordon model ( see , e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath39    with the help of ( [ ll1 ] ) we can rewrite energy density ( [ magnen ] ) as follows :    @xmath40+\\tilde{q}\\partial_{\\tilde{z}}\\phi+\\left(1-\\cos\\phi\\right),\\ ] ]    where the pitch vector @xmath41 coincides with its standard notation if we switch back to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath42 . depending on @xmath43 , stationary solutions to eqn.[sing ] are either a ferromagnetic state @xmath44 ( mod @xmath45 ) or a spiral structure @xmath46 , with @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath48 is the amplitude of an elliptical integral , and @xmath49 is the modulus of the elliptic function .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath49 can be thought of as a parameter of the theory and should be determined by minimising the total energy ( [ magnen1 ] ) of the system , resulting in    @xmath50    equation ( [ min ] ) does not have any solution as long as @xmath51 , so that the ground state is ferromagnetic , whereas for @xmath52 the system is in a spiral state , i.e. @xmath53 changes by @xmath45 with period @xmath54 [ here we have used elliptical integrals of the first @xmath55 and second @xmath56 kind , respectively ] . in the latter case ,",

    ", @xmath53 changes in a tiny region around @xmath59 with a characteristic lengthscale @xmath60 , so that @xmath53 can be approximated with a constant over large regions of space .",
    "therefore , the ground state @xmath53 represents a lattice of @xmath61kinks separated by elongated regions @xmath24 ( an example is shown in fig .  [ lattice ] ) .    as we have just seen , under certain physically motivated conditions the landau - lifshitz equation for magnetically ordered systems can be reduced to the well - known sine - gordon problem , equation ( [ sing ] ) , where @xmath62 defines magnetic order in a structure .",
    "all the solutions to equation ( [ sing ] ) with uniform asymptotic behaviour at @xmath63 have been analysed with the inverse scattering method @xcite .",
    "interestingly , equation ( [ kink ] ) with nontrivial ground state configuration can not be integrated out with standard methods .",
    "it is also reasonable to expect that the propagation of a soliton throughout the lattice of kinks differs from that with a homogeneous magnetisation @xcite .",
    "the sine - gordon equation ( [ sing ] ) can be solved by means of bcklund auto - transformations leading in general to an @xmath49-solitonic solution @xcite .",
    "these transformations are known to link one solution to another , often linear , equation .",
    "it is noteworthy that the obtained solutions determine nonlinear superposition principle and in general allow to derive an infinite family of exact solutions , using straightforward algebra only .",
    "the formation of solitons is associated with local translation of the magnetic structure by @xmath64 .",
    "one can classify the general solution to belong to one of the following groups , discussed below .",
    "first we consider a structure characterized by the following asymptotic behaviour :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 : at @xmath67 an extra kink of the same chirality emerges and the background structure ( a lattice of @xmath61kinks ) is shifted by @xmath68 along the helical axis .",
    "note that this shift is smaller than a period of the kink crystal @xmath24 . at @xmath69",
    "the kink crystal grows by a period and an extra kink of the opposite chirality appears .",
    "provided the expression ( [ bc1 ] ) takes place , one can expect the existence of an odd number of domain walls with mutually opposite chirality and an arbitrary number of breathers , which can be thought of as pulsatile soliton , i.e. a bound state of two kinks with opposite chiralities .",
    "the magnetic structure in this case allows propagation of spin waves which does not lead to the local translation , i.e. spin waves do not affect the nontrivial background structure .",
    "another scenario is realized for the following asymptotic behaviour :    @xmath70    which allows an even number of kinks with mutually opposite chirality and an arbitrary number of breathers , while @xmath68 stands for the local translation due to soliton formation . to convince oneself that the expressions ( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bc2 ] ) do make physical sense one in general maps nonlinear differential equation to an equivalent system of differential equations ( in mathematics",
    "this strategy is known as lax transformation ) . for the sine - gordon model ( [ sing ] )",
    "one can construct a solution which corresponds to translations of the background structure ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "when the analytical solution has been determined one can observe ( see supplementary movies ) that the formation of a soliton is associated with local translations of a lattice of @xmath61kinks which needs to be taken into account via asymptotic behavior ( [ bc1 ] ) and ( [ bc2 ] ) . in fact , a newly created soliton interacts with surrounding kinks pushing them away .",
    "remarkably , in each case the background helical structure readjusts itself to counteract the formation of a soliton .",
    "this causes the soliton to move through a kink crystal resulting in local translation of the spiral structure by @xmath68 in a direction opposite to that in which the soliton travels .",
    "interestingly , the scalar field @xmath62 fluctuates when the soliton interacts with kinks of the background structure . in the vicinity of a commensurate - incommensurate phase transition ( @xmath71 )",
    "the collision of two solitons with opposite chiralities leads to partial annihilation and local magnetisation fluctuations determined by @xmath73 .",
    "summarising , a wide class of helical magnets with inhomogeneous ground state configuration ( spin spiral ) promotes propagation of multisolitonic structure , so that it shifts the spin spiral slightly past the original position .",
    "this finding is as we will see in the following section , in good agreement with numerical simulations utilising an atomistic , discrete model .    * numerical simulations *",
    "meaningful information on the nature of the ground and excited states can be extracted from studying magnetisation dynamics by numerical methods .",
    "this is typically done by finding solutions of phenomenological landau - lifshitz equation equipped with gilbert term @xcite , that stands for dissipation , and a slonczewski contribution responsible for current - driven phenomena .",
    "both gilbert damping and spin - transfer torque have to be treated on equal footing and can be microscopically derived @xcite ; while spin - polarised electronic structure calculations , may be used to evaluate relevant parameters of an effective spin - hamiltonian @xcite . hence exchange and dm interaction",
    "may be evaluated and used in an atomistic description of the spin - system , where also a dynamical description is possible .    in the present study",
    ", we are interested in the current induced soliton dynamics in a one - dimensional lattice . under the influence of an external magnetic field the spin structure is expected to change into kink crystal according to equation ( [ kink ] ) , as discussed above . to study the motion of the solitons in 1d structure in the presence of a spin polarised current , we have performed atomistic spin dynamics simulations based on the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation with additional terms to describe the spin transfer torque effect . the investigation of dynamics of the solitons introduced in the system is performed in terms of atomistic spin dynamics method @xcite , as implemented in the uppasd package @xcite ( see method ) .",
    "* stabilisation and soliton structure . *",
    "using models which are defined in methods ( equations ( [ latham ] )  ( [ lali ] ) ) , we now turn to the task of describing the microscopic structure of the solitons considered earlier , as they result from numerical simulation based on an atomistic approach . in order to describe a soliton structure from the llg simulations , we consider a one - dimensional chiral magnet with 1000 magnetic moments along the @xmath7direction with periodic boundaries conditions . in the system",
    "the heisenberg ferromagnetic exchange interactions and the dm interactions are considered between nearest neighbours only , so that in continuous limit the hamiltonian ( [ magnen ] ) is recovered . in the first calculation",
    "the strength of the ferromagnetic exchange interaction is @xmath74 mry and the strength of the dm interaction is @xmath75 mry .",

    ", we only used one value of the damping parameter ( @xmath87 = 0.1 ) .",
    "one can easily see that the systems with different damping are almost identical and upon increasing the external field , the size of the solitons decreases almost linearly with respect to the magnitude of the applied field . for the system which is held at finite temperature",
    "we observe that fluctuations are more pronoucned , but it follows the tendency of the zero temperature simulations . for sufficiently large fields , the external field dominates over the internal exchange interactions and as a result , the soliton lattice breaks down and we observe a phase transition to a commensurate ferromagnetic ordering .    the data in fig .",
    "[ magnfield ] show that the soliton is stable also at elevated temperatures , albeit with slightly different characteristics compared to the soliton at t=0 k. in order to study the possibility of stabilizing solutions depicted in fig .",
    "[ lattice ] at even higher temperatures we note that in agreement with theoretical predictions , increased values of @xmath88 and @xmath20 should not influence the size of the soliton , as long as the ratio @xmath83 ratio is fixed .",
    "for this reason we increased the value of @xmath88 to 3.76 mry and @xmath20 to 0.16 mry , and investigated the stability as a function of applied field and temperature .",
    "we find that the soliton is stable at temperatures at least up to 10 k , and that at this temperature it takes an applied field of @xmath89 t to destabilize the soliton .",
    "parameters of exchange and dm interaction of this strength are not atypical @xcite , and hence this exercise shows that the soliton proposed here should be possible to study experimentally , not only at sub - kelvin temperatures . the period of spiral structure can be tuned by adjusting the external magnetic field .",

    "after very short time we stop the flow of the current and the system minimises its energy and in this process some of the atomic moments are flipping back .",
    "the perturbation which is caused by the current is big enough for the system to stabilise two solitons ( fig .",

    "other geometries and realizations of the results found in fig .  [ two_solitons ] or fig",
    ".  [ experiment2 ] may be possible , but we discuss here some requirements that would be needed to realize an experiment based on the geometry of fig .  [ experiment ] .",
    "the solitons are initially located at region a and region b. the location of solitons at these regions can be realized by imposing local modifications of the materials parameters in these regions , e.g. by reducing the diameter of the nano - device in this region .",
    "this is experimentally realized for domain walls . also , from figs .",
    "[ magnfield ] and [ sigma_h ] we note that typical sizes and velocities of the solitons discussed here are in the range of 40 - 80 nm , respectively 2000 - 4000 m / s . a relevant time scale for a successful experimental realization of fig .",
    "[ experiment ] would be set by the time a soliton would take before it leaves a region of space equal to its own size .",
    "this puts a temporal limit of the electronics needed to control the spin - currents driving the colliding solitons , as discussed in fig .",
    "[ two_solitons ] . with the size and speed mentioned above",
    "we estimate that electronics in the frequency range 25 - 100 ghz is needed , which is within current technological abilities @xcite . for the event when one solition , located at region c , turns in to two solitons , by reversal of the current ( simulations in fig .",
    "[ experiment2 ] ) , it is possible to ensure that the initial location of the singular soliton is at region c , by a local modification of the parameters of the nano - device , e.g. by changing the diameter , as discussed above .    we have discussed here possible ways to both annihilate and create solitons with the use of spin polarised currents , in a controlled way , and we have proposed a potential devise which has technological relevance since it easily to create and destroy bits ( solitons ) .",
    "a two state device can hence be realised , where the presence of one or two solitons in the device is simply detected by the resistance of the device .",
    "our results are comparable with results of domain wall motion , albeit the soliton solution is shown here to be particularly useful for the device outlined in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] .",

    "thus , technology proposed in our work has advantage and happens because of soliton in our case propagates through kink crystal in contrast to domain walls which spreads through uniformly polarised ferromagnet .    in the end of this section",
    "we would like to point out that llg allows a certain class of analytical solutions , e.g. , propagating domain wall or walker s dynamical solution .",

    "interestingly , spin waves emitted by one domain wall traveling through another domain wall can lead to attraction between them via spin transfer @xcite . in line with our results",

    ", macroscopic translation of solitons in spiral structures might be visualised with magneto - optical measurements or magnetic force microscopy . in the proximity of a commensurate - incommensurate transition",
    ", the solitonic motion can be easily controlled by tuning temperature or by an applied external magnetic field , which is perpendicular to the helical axis .",
    "in addition , the presence of breathers can be investigated by applying microwave pulses corresponding to eigenfrequencies of the breather . the second class of nonlinear excitations is comprised of spin - wave pulses .",
    "the formation of such pulses does not lead to macroscopic translation of the background structure .",
    "in fact , magnetisation in propagating spin waves fluctuates around a nonuniform spiral state , which corresponds to an equilibrium magnetic structure . in this case",
    "the interaction is not sufficient to stabilise the pulses , and pulses that initially are localised , spread in time thanks to dispersion .",
    "small - amplitude pulses can be approximated with a superposition of linear spin waves corresponding to helical structure .    by combining analytical and numerical work",
    ", we have established stability criteria for these magnetic solitons . the parameter space relevant for the soliton solutions is , rewardingly , the same in the analytical and numerical work , and is an internal test of the robustness of our theory .",
    "we have in addition shown that it is possible to annihilate and create solitons by means of a spin - polarised current , which couples to the magnetic sub - system via a spin - transfer torque .",
    "concrete suggestions of magnetic devices have been proposed , and it is demonstrated that with experimentally realistic currents , two state solutions can be induced on a time - scale of 325 ps for the annihilation and of 255 ps for the creation . this creates a basis for new technologies in magnetic storage as well as for logical operations using magnetism .",

    "<S> in magnetic materials a variety of non - collinear ground state configurations may emerge as a result of competition among exchange , anisotropy , and dipole - dipole interaction , yielding magnetic states far more complex than those of homogenous ferromagnets . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest in this study are particle - like configurations . </S>",
    "<S> these particle - like states , e.g. , magnetic solitons , skyrmions , or domain walls , form a spatially localised clot of magnetic energy . in this paper we address topologically protected magnetic solitons and explore concepts that potentially might be relevant for logical operations and/or information storage in the rapidly advancing filed of solitonics ( and skyrmionics ) . </S>",
    "<S> an ability to easily create , address , and manipulate such structures is among the prerequisite forming a basis of `` -onics technology '' , and is investigated in detail here using numerical and analytical tools .    </S>",
    "<S> low - dimensional magnetic systems remain a challenge , representing an exciting part of modern condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> tremendous progress in fabrication and characterization of magnetic nanostructures @xcite allows to approach experimental investigations of nonlinear phenomena , which previously were considered to form a purely theoretical research area . from both fundamental scientific and technological perspectives , consistent studies of controllable motion of spin textures , that emerge in magnetic materials @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , pose many of the most interesting scientific questions . depending on distance between neighbour spins , hybridization effects and details of the electronic structure as well as the crystalline symmetry </S>",
    "<S> , various magnetic configurations may emerge . </S>",
    "<S> these configurations range from collinear ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states , to non - collinear helimagnets and more complicated textures . in chiral magnets , where magnetic spiral ordering with a given sense of rotation is present , a non - collinear configuration may result from the competition between symmetric heisenberg exchange and anisotropic antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) coupling . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , magnetocrystalline structures which support spiral ground states are characterized by the lack of inversion symmetry and , as a consequence , antisymmetric exchange dm interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the latter takes place e.g. in metallic mnsi @xcite , insulating cub@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , and semiconducting cr@xmath2nbs@xmath0 @xcite .    of particular interest for magnetic nano - objects </S>",
    "<S> are magnetic structures that are localized in space , i.e. solitons . </S>",
    "<S> an example of this is the domain wall , where a lot of knowledge has been obtained , both as concerns static @xcite and dynamic @xcite properties . </S>",
    "<S> other magnetic solitons , like chiral spin - spirals and skyrmions @xcite have remained less explored , so far . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the balance between heisenberg exchange and dm interaction allows for nontrivial topological spin - textures to exist as a ground state configuration of ferromagnets , that may develop towards two - dimensional chiral modulations , i.e. skyrmions . </S>",
    "<S> the skyrmion spin - configuration , with a fixed azimuthal angle , influenced by the underlying crystalline structure , might be stabilized in a non - centrosymmetric magnet @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a topological soliton may be stable both physically and topologically , i.e. it has a smooth defect - free core with a definite diameter that is characterized by material parameters only . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the first experimental observation of a skyrmionic texture in a nano - sized , thin film structure were reported @xcite , for fege and fe@xmath3co@xmath3si . </S>",
    "<S> experiments reported a stable skyrmion phase in a wide temperature window , well below the curie point , by means of lorentz transmission electron microscopy . in another , recent , work a soliton phase was reported , experimentally , in an antiferromagnetic chain compound , kcugaf@xmath4 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , the class of quasi - one - dimensional magnetics includes a variety of systems ranging from metal - organic complexes , consisting of weakly coupled spin chains , to helimagnets , in which magnetisation varies in one spatial dimension . from practical aspects , </S>",
    "<S> the most interesting class of compounds is the one where there exists a possibility to manipulate non - trivial topological structures by means of an external field or current . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , chiral magnets attract a lot of attention not only for being interesting from a fundamental viewpoint but also as a promising candidate for future spintronic devices . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned , the compound cr@xmath2nbs@xmath0 @xcite is of interest , since a chiral soliton lattice has been proposed for its magnetic structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> its hexagonal structure is built up from nbs@xmath0 layers intercalated by cr ions . </S>",
    "<S> there are three basic magnetic interactions present in this structure : the ferromagnetic exchange within the cr layers @xmath5 , another ferromagnetic interaction between such cr layers , @xmath6 , and the dm interaction between the cr ions . </S>",
    "<S> the latter two interactions belong to the two intercalating layers separated by nbs@xmath0 @xcite , and the competition between them forms a helical structure .    there are two ways to drive the motion of a chiral soliton lattice : either by injecting a spin - polarised current into a sample ( incoherent method ) , or by twisting the phase angle of the magnetic order parameter which directly couples to a magnetic field ( coherent method ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , one may envision the latter scenario using a rotating magnetic field , that is applied to one end of the sample , and that is sufficiently strong to orient the magnetisation parallel to it . because of the stiffness of the spin system , the spin rotation at one end is transmitted to the other end of the sample , even if it is not subject to the direct effect of the applied rotating magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> transmission of the torque through the sample hence presents a spin current . the incoherent current injection method to drive the sliding dynamics </S>",
    "<S> has already been proposed @xcite , whereas chiral helimagnets are promising candidates to realise the coherent method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out @xcite that once a sliding motion of helimagnets is triggered , the soliton lattice maintains its persistent motion assisted by a generation of inertial mass . </S>",
    "<S> another observable consequence of the coherent motion is the appearance of a spin motive force @xcite , when the time dependence of the longitudinal magnetic field manifests itself in the temporal regime of the spin motive force . remarkably , the chiral soliton lattice is a macroscopically ordered object , which contains macroscopic amounts of magnetic solitons ( kinks ) . due to the very large number of solitons , the spin motive force of this lattice </S>",
    "<S> is expected to be strongly amplified as compared with that caused by a single magnetic domain wall in a ferromagnet @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a detailed and systematic analysis of a quasi - one - dimensional chiral soliton lattice , e.g. as has been recently observed in cr@xmath2nbs@xmath0 @xcite , and the soliton - soliton interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we combine our numerical findings , obtained from atomistic spin dynamics simulations , with analytical results , performed for a one - dimensional helical structure which is known to support a soliton lattice as a ground state , when an external magnetic field perpendicular to helical axis is applied . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in contrast to a uniformly polarized ground state configuration the formation and propagation of solitons on top of a kink crystal leads to a macroscopic translation of magnetic texture which should be experimentally detectable . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results are found to be in good agreement with the analytical theory and this allows us to touch upon nonlinear dynamics of solitons and spin waves in spin - spiral structures , opening thus a way for solitonics . </S>"
