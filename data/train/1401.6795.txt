    "biomembranes are ubiquitous in nature",
    ". an essential element of a biomembrane is a lipid bilayer , which is composed of phospholipid molecules .",
    "these molecules have hydrophilic head groups and a pair of hydrophobic tails . due to these properties ,",
    "when a large number of lipid molecules are placed in a solution , they self - assemble , under suitable conditions , into two - dimensional structures consisting of two leaflets ( or monolayers ) .",
    "the lipid molecules are oriented so that the tails of the molecules in each leaflet are in contact with each other , while the head groups are in contact with the suspending solution ; see , for example , lasic  @xcite .",
    "these two - dimensional structures often close to form vesicles and are usually between 50 nanometers and tens of micrometers in diameter but only a few nanometers thick , as observed by luisi and walde  @xcite . due to these dimensions ,",
    "lipid bilayers are usually modeled as surfaces .",
    "an accepted expression for the free - energy density of a lipid bilayer takes the form = 2(h - h_)^2+|k , [ chexpression ] where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the mean and gaussian curvatures of the midsurface of the bilayer , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the splay and saddle - splay moduli , respectively , and @xmath4 is the spontaneous mean - curvature , which describes the natural , local shape of the bilayer . while helfrich  @xcite first suggested as a model for lipid bilayers , canham  @xcite previously proposed with @xmath5 as a model for red blood cells .",
    "therefore is commonly called the canham  helfrich free - energy density .",
    "most often , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are viewed as material parameters , as is @xmath4 , and this view is adopted here . whereas @xmath0 is always positive and can be measured in numerous ways , including , for example , flicker spectroscopy ( brochard and lennon  @xcite , schneider , jenkins and webb  @xcite ) and x - ray scattering ( liu and nagle  @xcite , tristram - nagle and nagle  @xcite ) , @xmath1 is more difficult to quantify .",
    "part of the problem in determining @xmath1 is related to the gauss  bonnet theorem ( do carmo  @xcite ) , which states that the integral of the gaussian curvature @xmath3 over a surface depends only on the topology and boundary of that surface .",
    "granted that @xmath1 is constant and that the bilayer is closed , the second term on the right - hand side of therefore plays a role only in particular processes , such as fusion and fission events , or in multiphase lipid bilayers .    despite this difficulty , experimental and numerical strategies for obtaining @xmath1",
    "as @xmath0 is relatively easily obtained , it is convenient to specify @xmath1 through the ratio @xmath6 .",
    "this ratio is typically found to be negative , with magnitude depending on the constitution of the bilayer . while experiments conducted by baumgart , das and webb  @xcite and by lorzen , servuss and helfrich  @xcite delivered values of @xmath6 close to @xmath7 ( namely @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively ) , experiments conducted by semrau , idema , holtzer , schmidt and storm  @xcite delivered values of @xmath6 between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "coarse - grained numerical simulations performed by hu , brigugli and deserno  @xcite and hu , de jong , marrink and deserno  @xcite yielded values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . on the basis of a microscopic model for amphiphilic molecules dissolved in water , chacn , somoza and tarazona",
    "@xcite obtained a value of @xmath6 of approximately @xmath14 .",
    "a derivation of the canham  helfrich free - energy density based on considering the interactions between the lipid molecules that comprise the bilayer was carried out by seguin and fried  @xcite . that derivation provides integral representations for the moduli in terms of a generic interaction potential . in the present work ,",
    "two potentials are considered , and the integrals are evaluated to obtain @xmath0 and @xmath1 . before performing these calculations , two simplifying postulates are imposed : the lipid molecules comprising the bilayer are assumed to be ( a ) identical and ( b ) uniformly distributed .",
    "the resulting moduli are described in terms of several parameters . besides the molecular number density",
    ", these parameters fall into two categories : those determined by the dimensions of the molecules and those appearing in the interaction potential .",
    "it is shown that the first potential considered , which is an anisotropic gaussian potential based on those of berne and pechukas @xcite and gay and berne @xcite , is not able to capture a significant majority of the values for the bending moduli found in the literature .",
    "this motivates considering an anisotropic spherocylinder potential introduced recently by lintuvuori and wilson @xcite , which performs much better .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "synopses of the salient features of surface geometry and the derivation of seguin and fried  @xcite respectively appear in sections  [ appsurf ] and [ sectrecap ] .",
    "section [ sectcalc ] contains two subsections , one for each of the potentials considered .",
    "for each potential , the bending moduli are calculated and the resulting expressions are compared to what can be found in the literature .",
    "consider a smooth , orientable surface @xmath15 in a three - dimensional euclidean point space .",
    "let @xmath16 denote a smooth mapping that determines a unit normal at each point of the surface . given a mapping @xmath17 defined on the surface that takes values in some vector space @xmath18 , the surface gradient @xmath19 of @xmath20 can be defined by [ defsg ] ^_x h:=_x h^e ( *",
    "1 * -(x)(x))x , where @xmath21 is an extension of @xmath20 to a neighborhood of @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the classical three - dimensional gradient of this extension at @xmath22 .",
    "importantly , it can be shown that the definition of the surface gradient is independent of the extension appearing on the right - hand side of .",
    "of particular interest is the curvature tensor @xmath24 , the negative of the surface gradient @xmath25 of @xmath16 , which is a second - order tensor field defined on @xmath15 .",
    "the tensor @xmath26 is symmetric and has two scalar invariants : the mean curvature @xmath2 and gaussian curvature @xmath3 , as defined by [ h ] h:=trand [ k ] k:=[(tr)^2-tr(^2 ) ] .",
    "if @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the two nontrivial eigenvalues of @xmath26 , often called the principle curvatures , then and yield h=(_1+_2 ) k=_1_2 .",
    "the derivation of seguin and fried  @xcite rests on four assumptions :    1 .",
    "the thickness of the bilayer is small relative to its average diameter ; 2 .",
    "the ( phospholipid ) molecules can be modeled as one - dimensional rigid rods ; 3 .",
    "the molecules do not tilt relative to the orientation of the bilayer ; 4 .",
    "interactions between the bilayer and the solution are negligible .",
    "assumption ( i ) , which is often made in models for lipid bilayers ( luisi and walde  @xcite ) , allows the lipid bilayer to be identified with its midsurface @xmath15 . this surface may adopt a large variety of shapes ; however ,",
    "being made up of molecules of a finite size , it can not support arbitrarily large curvatures .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the smallest stable radius of curvature that the bilayer may exhibit .",
    "from here on , assume the the bilayer is in a given , fixed configuration @xmath15 at a fixed temperature .    for each leaflet @xmath30 of the bilayer , introduce a molecular number density @xmath31 defined on @xmath15 and measured per unit area of @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the area element on @xmath15 .",
    "the total number of molecules in leaflet @xmath30 is then given by the integral _ w_i(y)a_y .",
    "taking @xmath31 to be defined on @xmath15 amounts to assuming that the centers of the lipid molecules of both leaflets lie on @xmath15 , which is consistent with assuming that the bilayer is thin relative to its average diameter .",
    "in general , the number densities of the leaflets may differ .    on the basis of assumption ( ii )",
    ", the configuration of each molecule in the bilayer may be described by a point on @xmath15 and a unit - vector - valued director , with the point representing the center of the rod and the director representing the orientation of the rod . without loss of generality , it is assumed that the director tips point toward the headgroups of the molecules .",
    "it is further assumed that the interaction between a pair of molecules at two different points on @xmath15 is governed by a potential that depends on a vector connecting the points and the directors at the points and is restricted such that only molecules separated by distances less than some cutoff distance @xmath33 may interact .",
    "moreover , @xmath33 is required to be small relative to the smallest radius of curvature @xmath29 the bilayer can support , so that @xmath34 or , equivalently , [ small ] : = 1 . as will be discussed in the next section , instead of possessing a cutoff distance , some potentials decay rather rapidly as the distance between the interacting molecules increases . for such potentials ,",
    "it is possible to define an effective cutoff distance beyond which the interaction is negligible and , thus , may be neglected .",
    "choose points @xmath22 and @xmath35 on @xmath15 and consider a molecule at @xmath22 with orientation @xmath36 and a molecule at @xmath35 with orientation @xmath37 .",
    "the points @xmath22 and @xmath35 should be thought of as coincident with the centers of the molecules .",
    "suppose that interactions between the molecules at @xmath22 and @xmath35 are governed by a potential @xmath38 , with dimensions of energy , depending on the vectors @xmath39 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "granted that @xmath38 is frame - indifferent , its dependence on the foregoing quantities must reduce to dependence on the scalars @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 .",
    "assume that this dependence takes the form ( , , ) = ( ^-2 , , , ) , [ psigeneric ] where @xmath44 satisfies [ ieradius ] ( s^2,a , b , c)=0 the stipulation ensures that the molecules at @xmath22 and @xmath35 interact only if the distance @xmath45 between @xmath22 and @xmath35 obeys r < d=. in contrast to @xmath38 , @xmath44 is independent of @xmath46 .",
    "importantly , the interaction energy @xmath44 between two molecules can change on flipping the head group and tails of one of the molecules .",
    "interaction potentials of this form may therefore account for differences between the polarities of the head group and tails of a lipid molecule .",

    "( x):=\\{y:|x - y}. seguin and fried  @xcite argued that the interactions between the lipid molecules making up the bilayer contribute to the free - energy density @xmath54 through the four terms .",
    "however , upon evaluating these integrals for a particular potential , it transpires that the results scale more appropriately if that scale factor is not introduced . ]",
    "@xmath55 the integral in represents the contribution to the free - energy density coming from the interactions between the molecules in leaflet 1 at @xmath22 and all other molecules in leaflet 1 .",

    "the integral in accounts for the interactions between the molecules in leaflet 1 at @xmath22 and all other molecules in leaflet 2 .",
