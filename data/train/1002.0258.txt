    "<S> the inelastic x - ray scattering spectrum for phonons of @xmath0-symmetry including the cuo bond - stretching phonon dispersion is analyzed by a lorentz fit in hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 and bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 , respectively , using recently calculated phonon frequencies as input parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting mode frequencies of the fit are almost all in good agreement with the calculated data . </S>",
    "<S> an exception is the second highest @xmath0-branch compromising the bond - stretching modes which disagrees in both compounds with the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> this branch unlike the calculations shows an anomalous softening with a minimum around the wavevector @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> such a disparity with the calculated results , that are based on the assumption of an undisturbed translation- and point group invariant electronic structure of the cuo plane , indicates some _ static _ charge inhomogenities in the measured probes . </S>",
    "<S> most likely these will be charge stripes along the cuo bonds which have the strongest coupling to certain longitudinal bond - stretching modes that in turn selfconsistently induce corresponding _ dynamic _ </S>",
    "<S> charge inhomogenities . </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry breaking by the mix of dynamic and static charge inhomogenities can lead to a reconstruction of the fermi surface into small pockets .    in recent work @xcite the ixs phonon spectrum of optimally doped hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 and bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 , respectively , has been measured for the @xmath0-symmetry modes . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra have been interpreted by a voigt fit function . for the interesting high frequency part of the spectra where </S>",
    "<S> the cuo bond - stretching modes ( bsm ) are expected that are known to display an anomalous softening upon doping in the cuprates @xcite , only one phonon peak has been fitted in case of hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 @xcite and two in case of bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 @xcite .    on the other hand , from our microscopic calculation of the phonon dynamics of hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 and bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 @xcite we find in the high energy region of the ixs spectra along @xmath5 up to four @xmath0 modes as far as hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 is concerned and up to five @xmath0 modes in bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these modes interact strongly with each other and constitute a highly nontrivial anticrossing scenario . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> a multiple mode fit is necessary to obtain more reliable results . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the measured peaks strongly decreases for larger @xmath6 values such that at @xmath7 the peaks are very weak , see e.g. , and an unique interpretation taking only one or two peaks into account is incomplete because of the many modes of the same symmetry in this region of energy . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it is very interesting that in the limited voigt fit of the spectra in @xcite a hint to an anomalous softening of the bsm - dispersion is extracted at @xmath8 in the hg compound and at @xmath9 in the bi compound . </S>",
    "<S> such an enhanced softening at these @xmath6 values has not been detected in our calculations for the @xmath0 modes . only the presumably generic softening in the cuprates of the half - breathing mode ( hbm ) in hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 and of two half - breathing modes in bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 , generated by the strong nonlocal electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) mediated by the charge fluctuations ( cf ) on the outer electron shells of the ions , has been found in our calculations @xcite .    in the presence of these theoretical results and the complex anticrossing of the @xmath0 modes it is very desirable to perform a more complete analysis of the ixs measurements on the basis of the calculation of the dispersion of the @xmath0 modes as given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a reconstruction of the ixs phonon spectra we do not apply the more complicated voigt fit but use instead a more simple lorentz fit function , which does the job very well . </S>",
    "<S> this can be concluded from ( a ) where the ixs spectrum of hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 @xcite is reconstructed for @xmath10 using as in @xcite only one peak in the lorentz fit . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon frequencies fitted at @xmath11 , 0.17 , 0.23 , 0.29 , 0.36 , 0.42 and 0.48 are 16.28 ( 16.32 ) , 15.76 ( 15.73 ) , 14.61 ( 14.65 ) , 13.38 ( 13.73 ) , 13.15 ( 13.14 ) , 13.40 ( 13.53 ) and 13.51 ( 13.63 ) thz . the data within the brackets are the frequencies as obtained from the voigt fit @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we recognize a very good agreement between both fitting procedures . as far as bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> is concerned we also get nearly undistinguishable results for a two mode fit in the two fitting schemes , so we take the more simple lorentz fit in this work .    </S>",

    "<S> must be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated frequencies at the corresponding @xmath6 values are taken as input parameters of the lorentz fit . from the results displayed in ( b ) </S>",

    "<S> the resulting phonon frequencies from the fit are shown in ( c ) together with the calculated dispersion of the @xmath0 modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> with exception of the second highest @xmath0 branch comprising the bsm that displays the anomalous softening starting at @xmath14 with a minimum around @xmath15 , the resulting mode frequencies are in reasonable agreement with the calculated branches .    </S>",

    "<S> the vertical bars indicate the fwhm of the peaks determined in the fitting . ]    in case of bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 the lorentz fit of the ixs spectrum on the basis of the calculated @xmath0-modes @xcite is shown in ( b ) and likewise as in hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 a good resolution of the spectrum is achieved . </S>",

    "<S> are displayed in the figure . leaving aside the second highest branch we find a good agreement of the calculated branches with the modes from the lorentz fit . </S>",
    "<S> as for hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 the second highest @xmath0 branch displays an anomalous softening starting at @xmath14 with a minimum around @xmath16 .     as induced by the half - breathing mode ( with the lower frequency ) in bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 ( a ) and in hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows indicate the vibrating oxygen ions . </S>",
    "<S> units are in @xmath17 @xmath18 . regions of space where electrons are accumulated are characterized by full lines and those where electrons are pushed away by broken - dotted lines . ]    </S>",
    "<S> strong coupling of the bsm with dynamic charge stripes generated selfconsistently via strong nonlocal electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) by the bsm themselves leading to an anomalous softening has already been found earlier in the cuprate based superconductors for the case of an undisturbed translation- and point group invariant electronic structure of the cuo plane without any charge inhomogenities @xcite . the same holds true for hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 and bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 as can be seen from the calculations in this work displayed in , where the charge redistribution @xmath19 for the half - breathing mode ( hbm ) @xmath20 ) induced by nonlocal epi is shown . in the hbm propagating in @xmath21 direction the o@xmath22 ions move coherently along the cuo bond towards or away from the silent cu ion . for the detailed displacement pattern , </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite .    illustrates that the hbm creates in both compounds dynamic charge ordering @xmath23 via charge fluctuations at the ions due to nonlocal epi in form of localized stripes of alternating sign in the cuo plane . </S>",
    "<S> the period of the pattern is twice the lattice constant for @xmath24 . in case of bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 these dynamic charge inhomogenities </S>",
    "<S> are only shown for one of the two hbm modes found in the calculations namely the one with the lower frequency , see ( c ) , because the charge redistribution is very similar for the other hbm . </S>",
    "<S> for hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 we obtain only one hbm , see ( c ) , which induces the dynamic stripe pattern in ( b ) . in the hbm the dynamic charge stripes point along the @xmath25- or @xmath26-axis , respectively , if the oxygen ions move along the cuo bond in @xmath26- or @xmath25-direction , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that for the oxygen breathing mode at the @xmath27 point , see @xcite , the dynamic stripes excited point along the diagonals of the cuo plane . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it should be remarked that dynamic charge inhomogenities like the dynamic stripe patterns would not be present in systems with only _ local _ epi at work . </S>",
    "<S> for example in a high density homogeneous electron gas prevailing in simple metals . </S>",
    "<S> this is because of perfect screening of the changes of the coulomb potential related to the displacement of the ions in a phonon mode . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> our calculations exhibit a strong nonlocal epi in the cuprates essentially due to the poor screening in these materials with a large component of ionic binding , see . </S>",
    "<S> e.g. @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this fact demonstrates the special role of a strong nonlocal epi for the physics of these compounds in their normal as well as in the superconducting state .    </S>",
    "<S> sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the gray domains mark the peaks of the eliashberg spectral function @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> such a strong coupling is also underlined by recent experimental results for the quasi - particle dispersion in ( bi , pb)@xmath28sr@xmath28cuo@xmath29 @xcite . the super - high resolution laser - based angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reported in @xcite show unambiguously that the @xmath30 mev nodal kink in the dispersion is due to strong epi with multiple phonon modes as seen in the eliashberg spectral function extracted from the measured real part of the electron self - energy . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the peak structure of the eliashberg function is in very good agreement with our calculated phonon density of states for bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 @xcite , see .    </S>",
    "<S> quite generally , our calculations for the cuprates demonstrate the enhanced susceptibility of the bsm for inducing dynamic charge inhomogenities in form of stripes in the cuo plane . </S>",
    "<S> so , it can safely argued that the latter also will occur in a modified way in systems with static stripe charge order breaking translation- and point group invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the anomalous softening around @xmath16 found by the analysis of the ixs phonon spectra then reflects the strong nonlocal coupling of the bsm with their selfconsistently induced dynamic charge inhomogenities ( dynamic stripes ) but now in probes with a static charge inhomogenity ( static stripes ) presumably present . </S>",
    "<S> excess holes in a stripe will even enhance the strong nonlocal coupling to the bsm and consequently also the magnitudes of the cf s and the related mode softening is increased . </S>",
    "<S> an interrelation between the number of holes and softening is supported by the experiment and our calculations for the cu - o - bond stretching modes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the symmetry breaking of the electronic structure by charge inhomogenity in form of static stripe patterns accompanied by phonon - induced dynamic fluctuating patterns shown by our calculations to occur very likely may lead to a corresponding reconstruction of the fermi surface into small pockets . </S>",
    "<S> this reconstruction is in turn the origin for the quantum oscillations measured in some cuprates , see e.g. @xcite . in this context </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting , that in @xcite the quantum oscillations are attributed to symmetry breaking by a certain type of stripe order in form of a combined charge/ spin modulation . </S>",
    "<S> other authors attribute the small fermi surface pockets to magnetic fluctuations @xcite , to @xmath31-density wave @xcite or to an antiferromagnetic @xmath32 spin density wave @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , it should be added that in the literature dynamic charge inhomogenities related to electron - phonon coupling are discussed from the experimental side for la@xmath33ba@xmath22cuo@xmath2 , yba@xmath1cu@xmath34o@xmath35 or ba@xmath36k@xmath37bio@xmath34 in @xcite and from the theoretical side e.g. in @xcite .    in summary , our analysis of the ixs phonon spectra for hgba@xmath1cuo@xmath2 and bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cuo@xmath3 within the framework of calculated phonon dispersion curves points to the existence of dynamic charge inhomogenities generated by the bsm via strong nonlocal epi of the cf - type . </S>",
    "<S> these modes excite dynamic charge order and consequently can also serve as indirect probes for corresponding static charge order in the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have a mix of static and fluctuating charge order in the materials . </S>"
