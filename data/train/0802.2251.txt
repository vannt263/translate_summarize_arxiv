    "berry introduced the term quantum chaology in his 1987 bakerian lecture  @xcite as the study of semiclassical but non - classical behaviour of systems whose classical motion exhibits chaos .",
    "he illustrated it with the statistics of energy levels , following his earlier work with tabor  @xcite and related developments from the study of a range of systems .",
    "in the regular spectrum of a bound system with @xmath0 degrees of freedom and @xmath1 constants of motion , the energy levels are labelled by @xmath1 quantum numbers , but the quantum numbers of nearby energy levels may be very different . in the case of an irregular spectrum , such as for an ergodic system where only energy is conserved , we can not use quantum number labelling .",
    "this prompted the use of energy level spacing distributions to allow comparisons among different spectra  @xcite .",
    "it was known , eg from the work of porter  @xcite , that the spacings between energy levels of complex nuclei and atoms with @xmath1 large are modelled by the spacings of eigenvalues of random matrices and that the wigner distribution  @xcite gives a very good fit .",
    "it turns out that the spacing distributions for generic regular systems are negative exponential , that is random ; but for irregular systems the distributions are skew and unimodal , at the scale of the mean spacing .",
    "mehta  @xcite provides a detailed discussion of the numerical experiments and functional approximations to the energy level spacing statistics , alt et al  @xcite compare eigenvalues from numerical analysis and from microwave resonator experiments , also eg .",
    "bohigas et al  @xcite and soshnikov  @xcite confirm certain universality properties .",
    "also , miller  @xcite provides much detail on a range of related number theoretic properties , including random matrix theory links with l - functions .",
    "forrester s online book  @xcite gives a wealth of analytic detail on the mathematics and physics of eigenvalues of infinite random matrices for the three ensembles of particular interest : gaussian orthogonal ( goe ) , unitary ( gue ) and symplectic ( gse ) , being the real , complex and quaternionic cases , respectively .",
    "the review by deift  @xcite illustrates how random matrix theory has significant links to a wide range of mathematical problems in the theory of functions as well as to mathematical physics . from  @xcite",
    ", we have definitions for the three cases of interest :    goe : : :    a random real symmetric @xmath2 matrix belongs to the    gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) if the diagonal and upper    triangular elements are independent random variables with gaussian    distributions of zero mean and standard deviation @xmath3 for    the diagonal and @xmath4 for the upper    triangular elements .",
    "gue : : :    a random hermitian @xmath2 matrix belongs to the    gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) if the diagonal elements    @xmath5 ( which must be real ) and the upper triangular    elements @xmath6 are independent random    variables with gaussian distributions of zero mean and standard    deviation @xmath4 for the    @xmath5 and @xmath7 for each of the    @xmath8 and @xmath9 gse : : :    a random hermitian @xmath2 matrix with real    quaternionic elements belongs to the gaussian symplectic ensemble    ( gse ) if the diagonal elements @xmath10 ( which must be    real ) are independent with gaussian distribution of zero mean and    standard deviation @xmath7 and the upper triangular    elements @xmath11 and    @xmath12 are independent random    variables with gaussian distributions of zero mean and standard    deviation @xmath13 for each of the    @xmath14 and @xmath9    then the matrices in these ensembles are respectively invariant under the appropriate orthogonal , unitary and symmetric transformation groups , and moreover in each case the joint density function of all independent elements is controlled by the trace of the matrices and is of form  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a normalizing factor .",
    "barndorff - nielsen et al  @xcite give some background mathematical statistics on the more general problem of quantum information and quantum statistical inference , including reference to random matrices .",
    "here we show that gamma distributions provide approximations to eigenvalue spacing distributions for the goe distribution comparable to the wigner distribution at the scale of the mean and for the gue and gse distributions , except near the origin",
    ". that may be useful because the gamma distribution has a well - understood and tractable information geometry  @xcite as well as the following important uniqueness property :    [ hwangthm ] for independent positive random variables with a common probability density function @xmath17 having independence of the sample mean and the sample coefficient of variation is equivalent to @xmath18 being the gamma distribution .",
    "it is noteworthy also that the non - chaotic case has an exponential distribution of spacings between energy levels and that the sum of @xmath1 independent identical exponential random variables follows a gamma distribution and moreover the sum of @xmath1 independent identical gamma random variables follows a gamma distribution ; furthermore , the product of gamma distributions is well - approximated by a gamma distribution .    from a different standpoint ,",
    "berry and robnik  @xcite gave a statistical model using a mixture of energy level spacing sequences from exponential and wigner distributions .",
    "monte carlo methods were used by car et al .",
    "@xcite to investigate such a mixture .",
    "car et al .",
    "established also the best fit of goe , gue and gse unit mean distributions , for spacing @xmath19 using the generalized gamma density which we can put in the form @xmath20^      { \\beta+1}}{\\left[\\gamma((1+\\beta)/\\omega)\\right]^{\\beta+2 } } \\ \\ { \\rm and } \\ \\",
    "b(\\beta , \\omega)= \\left[\\frac{\\gamma((2+\\beta)/\\omega ) }      { \\gamma((1+\\beta)/\\omega)}\\right]^\\omega \\ .",

    "observe that the exponential distribution is recovered by the choice @xmath22 these distributions are shown in figure  [ ggamgamfits ] along with corresponding fits of the gamma distribution .",
    "the two classes of spectra are illustrated in two dimensions by bouncing geodesics in plane billiard tables : eg in the de - symmetrized ` stadium of bunimovich ' with ergodic chaotic behaviour and irregular spectrum on the one hand , and on the other hand in the symmetric annular region between concentric circles with non - chaotic behaviour , regular spectrum and random energy spacings  @xcite .",
    "( 300,200)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )    it turns out that the mean spacing between eigenvalues of infinite symmetric real random matrices  the so called gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe)is bounded and therefore it is convenient to normalize the distribution to have unit mean ; also , the same is true for the gue and gse cases .",
    "barnett  @xcite provides a numerical tabulation of the first 1,276,900 eigenvalues .",
    "in fact , wigner  @xcite had already surmised that the cumulative probability distribution function at the scale of the mean spacing should be of the form : @xmath23 which has unit mean and variance @xmath24 with probability density function @xmath25 remarkably , wigner s surmise gave an extremely good fit with numerical computation of the true goe distribution , cf .",
    "mehta  @xcite appendix a.15 , and with a variety of observed data from atomic and nuclear systems  @xcite .    from mehta",
    "@xcite p 171 , we have bounds on the cumulative probability distribution function @xmath26 for the spacings between eigenvalues of infinite symmetric real random matrices : @xmath27 here the lower bound @xmath28 has mean @xmath29 and variance @xmath30 and the upper bound @xmath31 has mean @xmath32 and variance @xmath33    ( 300,200)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 )    the family of probability density functions for gamma distributions with dispersion parameter @xmath34 and mean @xmath35 for positive random variable @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 with variance @xmath38 then the subset having unit mean is given by @xmath39 with variance @xmath40 these parameters @xmath41 are called natural parameters because they admit presentation of the family ( [ gammapdfs ] ) as an exponential family  @xcite and thereby provide an associated natural affine immersion in @xmath42  @xcite @xmath43 this affine immersion was used  @xcite to present tubular neighbourhoods of the 1-dimensional subspace consisting of exponential distributions @xmath44 so giving neighbourhoods of random processes .",
    "the maximum entropy case has @xmath45 and corresponds to an underlying poisson random event process and so models spacings in the spectra for non - chaotic systems ; for @xmath46 the distributions are skew unimodular .",
    "the unit mean gamma distribution fit to the true goe distribution from mehta  @xcite has variance @xmath47 and hence @xmath48    in fact , @xmath49 is a geodesic coordinate in the riemannian 2-manifold of gamma distributions with fisher information metric  @xcite ; arc length along this coordinate from @xmath50 to @xmath51 is given by @xmath52    plotted in figure  [ cdfs ] are the cumulative distributions for the bounds ( [ bounds ] ) ( dashed ) , the gamma distribution ( thick solid ) fit to the true goe distribution with unit mean , and the wigner surmised distribution ( [ w ] ) ( thin solid ) .",
    "the corresponding probability density functions are in figure  [ pdfs ] : unit mean gamma distribution fit ( thick solid ) to the true goe distribution from mehta  @xcite appendix a.15 ( points ) , the wigner surmised density ( thin solid ) and the probability densities for the bounds ( dashed ) , respectively , @xmath53    ( 300,200)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 86,170)gse ( 70,135)gue ( 65,94)goe ( 25,144)@xmath54",
    "berry has pointed out  @xcite that the behaviour near the origin is an important feature of the ensemble statistics of these matrices and in particular the goe distribution is linear near the origin , as is the wigner distribution . moreover , for the unitary ensemble ( gue ) of complex hermitian matrices , near the origin , the behaviour is @xmath55 and for the symplectic ensemble ( gsm , representing half - integer spin particles with time - reversal symmetric interactions ) it is @xmath56      from ( [ unimeangamma ] ) we see that at unit mean the gamma density behaves like @xmath58 near the origin , so linear behaviour would require @xmath59 which gives a variance of @xmath60 whereas the goe fitted gamma distribution has @xmath61 and hence variance @xmath62 this may be compared with variances for the lower bound @xmath63 @xmath30 the upper bound @xmath64 @xmath65 and the wigner distribution @xmath66 @xmath67 the gamma distributions fitted to the lower and upper bounding distributions have , respectively , @xmath68 and @xmath69 figure  [ ggamgamfits ] shows the probability density functions for the unit mean gamma distributions ( dashed ) and generalized gamma distribution ( solid ) fits to the true variances for left to right the goe , gue and gse cases ; the two types coincide in the exponential case , @xmath70 shown dotted .",
    "the major differences are in the behaviour near the origin .",
    "figure  [ gamma1249 g ] shows unit mean gamma distributions with @xmath71 for the best fits to the true variances of the spacing distributions for the goe , gue and gse cases , as points on the affine immersion in @xmath42 of the @xmath72-manifold of gamma distributions , cf .",
    "the information metric provides information distances on the gamma manifold and so could be used for comparison of real data on eigenvalue spacings if fitted to gamma distributions ; that may allow identification of qualitative properties and represent trajectories during structural changes of systems .",
    "the author is indebted to rudnick  @xcite for pointing out that the gue eigenvalue spacing distribution is rather closely followed by the distribution of zeros for the riemann zeta function ; actually , hilbert had conjectured this , as mentioned along with a variety of other probabilistic aspects of number theory by schroeder  @xcite .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ zz2mguegam ] which shows with unit mean the probability distribution for spacings among the first 2,001,052 zeros from the tabulation of odlyzko  @xcite ( large points ) , that for the true gue distribution from the tabulation of mehta  @xcite appendix a.15 ( medium points ) and the gamma fit to the true gue ( small points ) , which has @xmath73 the grand mean spacing between zeros from the data was @xmath74 the coefficient of variation @xmath75 and variance @xmath76        table 1 shows the effect of location on the statistical data for spacings in the first ten consecutive blocks of 200,000 zeros of the riemann zeta function normalized with unit grand mean ; table 2 shows the effect of sample size . for gamma distributions",
    "we expect the coefficient of variation to be independent of sample size and location , by theorem  [ hwangthm ] .    * remark * the gamma distribution provides approximations to the true distributions for the spacings between eigenvalues of infinite random matrices for the goe , gue and the gse cases .",
    "however , it is clear that gamma distributions do not precisely model the analytic systems discussed here , and do not give correct asymptotic behaviour at the origin , as is evident from the results of car et al .",
    "@xcite who obtained excellent approximations for goe , gue and gse distributions using the generalized gamma distribution ( [ ggamma ] ) .",
    "the differences may be seen in figure  [ ggamgamfits ] which shows the unit mean distributions for gamma ( dashed ) and generalized gamma  @xcite ( solid ) fits to the true variances for the poisson , goe , gue and gse ensembles .",
    "the generalized gamma distributions do not have a tractable information geometry and so some features of the gamma distribution approximations may be useful in studies of qualitative generic properties in applications to data from real systems .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the extent to which data from real atomic and nuclear systems has generally the qualitative property that the sample coefficient of variation is independent of the mean .",
    "that , by theorem  [ hwangthm ] , is an information - theoretic distinguishing property of the gamma distribution .",
    "it would be interesting also to know if there is a number - theoretic property that corresponds to the apparently similar qualitative behaviour of the spacings of zeros of the riemann zeta function , tables 12.1 , 12.2 .",
    "since the non - chaotic case has an exponential distribution of spacings between energy levels and the sum of @xmath1 independent identical exponential random variables follows a gamma distribution and moreover the sum of @xmath1 independent identical gamma random variables follows a gamma distribution , a further analytic development would be to calculate the eigenvalue distributions for gamma or loggamma - distributed matrix ensembles .",
    "information geometrically , the riemannian manifolds of gamma and loggamma families are isometric , but the loggamma random variables have bounded domain and their distributions contain the uniform distribution , which may be important in modelling some real physical processes .",
