    "the purpose of this note is to answer a question raised by kogan , mello , and liqun @xcite , concerning the statistics of the eigenvalues of the scattering - matrix product @xmath0 for an absorbing optical cavity with chaotic dynamics . _ without _ absorption the scattering matrix @xmath1 is an @xmath2 unitary matrix , hence @xmath0 is simply the unit matrix . _ with _ absorption the eigenvalues @xmath3 of @xmath0 are real numbers between 0 and 1 .",
    "what is the probability distribution @xmath4 of these reflection eigenvalues in an ensemble of chaotic cavities ?    in principle , this problem can be solved by starting from the known distribution of @xmath1 in the absence of absorption ( which is dyson s circular ensemble @xcite ) , and incorporating the effects of absorption by a fictitious lead @xcite . what has been calculated in this way",
    "is the distribution @xmath4 for small @xmath5 @xcite and the density @xmath6 for large @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these results have a complicated form , quite unlike those familiar from the classical ensembles of random - matrix theory @xcite . for example , in the presence of time - reversal symmetry the distribution for @xmath7 is given by @xcite @xmath8\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mbox{}\\times|r_1-r_2|\\,\\bigl[\\gamma^2(1-{\\rm e}^{2\\gamma}+\\gamma+\\gamma { \\rm e}^{2\\gamma})\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mbox{}+\\gamma(r_1+r_2 - 2)({\\textstyle\\frac{3}{2}}-{\\textstyle\\frac{3}{2}}{\\rm e}^{2\\gamma}+2\\gamma+\\gamma { \\rm e}^{2\\gamma}+\\gamma^2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mbox{}+(1-r_1)(1-r_2)(3 - 3{\\rm e}^{2\\gamma}+{\\textstyle\\frac{9}{2}}\\gamma\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mbox{}+{\\textstyle\\frac{3}{2}}\\gamma { \\rm e}^{2\\gamma}+3\\gamma^2+\\gamma^3)\\bigr],\\label{pnis2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the ratio of the mean dwell time @xmath10 inside the cavity of the cavity modes by @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 . the definition of @xmath9 used in ref .",
    "@xcite differs by a factor @xmath5 . ] and the absorption time @xmath13 .",
    "the situation is simpler for reflection from an absorbing disordered waveguide . in the limit that the length of the waveguide goes to infinity ,",
    "the distribution of the reflection eigenvalues becomes that of the laguerre ensemble , after a transformation of variables from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "the ( unnormalized ) distribution is given by @xcite @xmath16 , \\label{pwire}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now @xmath17 contains the scattering time @xmath18 of the disorder .",
    "the integer @xmath19 in the presence ( absence ) of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the eigenvalue density is given by a sum over laguerre polynomials , hence the name `` laguerre ensemble '' @xcite .",
    "kogan , mello , and liqun @xcite used a maximum entropy assumption @xcite to argue that a chaotic cavity is also described by the laguerre ensemble , but in the variables @xmath14 instead of the @xmath20 s .",
    "their maximum entropy distribution is @xmath21 the coefficient @xmath22 in the exponent is left undetermined . ) for strong absorption ( @xmath23 ) , with coefficient @xmath24 . ]",
    "comparison with computer simulations gave good agreement for strong absorption , but not for weak absorption @xcite .",
    "this is unfortunate since the weak - absorption regime ( @xmath25 ) is likely to be the most interesting for optical experiments .",
    "although we know from the exact small-@xmath5 results @xcite that no simple distribution exists in the entire range of @xmath9 , one might hope for a simple eigenvalue distribution for small @xmath9 .",
    "what is it ?",
    "absorption with rate @xmath26 is equivalent to a shift in frequency @xmath27 by an imaginary amount @xmath28 . if we denote by @xmath29 the scattering matrix with absorption and by @xmath30 the scattering matrix without absorption , then @xmath31 . for weak absorption",
    "we can expand @xmath32,\\label{s0qrelation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the time - delay matrix @xcite . since @xmath34 is unitary , @xmath35 is hermitian .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath35 , the delay times @xmath36 , are real positive numbers .",
    "( [ s0qrelation ] ) implies that , for weak absorption , @xmath37s_{0}^{\\dagger}(\\omega).\\label{sqrelation}\\ ] ]    we conclude that the matrix product @xmath0 is related to the time - delay matrix @xmath35 by a unitary transformation .",
    "this relationship is a generalization to @xmath38 of the result of ramakrishna and kumar @xcite for @xmath39 ( when the unitary transformation becomes a simple identity ) . because a unitary transformation leaves the eigenvalues unchanged",
    ", one has @xmath40 , or equivalently , @xmath41 ( since @xmath42 for weak absorption ) .",
    "the probability distribution of the delay times in a chaotic cavity has recently been calculated , first for @xmath39 @xcite and later for any @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the corresponding distribution of the reflection eigenvalues for weak absorption is a generalized laguerre ensemble in the variables @xmath20 , @xmath43.\\label{pcavity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the eigenvalue density is given in terms of _ generalized _ laguerre polynomials , hence the name .",
    "the corresponding distribution of the reflection eigenvalues is @xmath44}{(1-r_{k})^{2-\\beta+3\\beta n/2}}.\\label{pcavityr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first moment of this distribution is @xmath45 , independent of @xmath46 .",
    "one can check that eq .",
    "( [ pcavityr ] ) is the small-@xmath9 asymptote of the exact result ( [ pnis2 ] ) for @xmath7 , @xmath47 .    in the case @xmath39 of a single scattering channel the distribution ( [ pcavityr ] )",
    "reduces to @xmath48,\\label{pcavitynis1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] including the normalization constant .",
    "we have plotted this function in fig .  1 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "it is totally different from the exponential distribution @xmath51 of ref .",
    "@xcite . for comparison",
    ", we have also included in fig .  1 the exact @xmath39 result @xcite ( which is known only for @xmath52 ) : @xmath53\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\mbox{}\\times\\left[\\gamma({\\rm e}^{\\gamma}-1)+(1+\\gamma-{\\rm e}^{\\gamma})(1-r)\\right].\\label{pnis1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is indeed close to the small-@xmath9 asymptote ( [ pcavitynis1 ] ) .",
    "summarizing , the distribution of the reflection eigenvalues of a weakly absorbing chaotic cavity is the generalized laguerre ensemble ( [ pcavity ] ) in the parametrization @xmath54 .",
    "the laguerre ensemble ( [ pmaxent ] ) in the variables @xmath14 , following from the maximum entropy assumption @xcite , is only valid for strong absorption . for intermediate absorption strengths",
    "the distribution is not of the form of the laguerre ensemble in any parametrization , cf .",
    "( [ pnis2 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of a long disordered waveguide is the laguerre ensemble ( [ pwire ] ) for all absorption strengths .",
    "the relationship between the reflection eigenvalues for weak absorption and the delay times implies that the delay times @xmath55 for reflection from a disordered waveguide of infinite length are distributed according to eq.([pwire ] ) if one substitutes @xmath56 .",
    "the implications of this laguerre ensemble for the delay times will be discussed elsewhere .",
