    "the search for silicon analogue of adamantane , called sila - adamantane , has so far been unsuccessful .",
    "there has been however some progress . a recent report by ficher , baumgartner and marschner ( fbm ) of synthesis of silylated sila - adamantane is a breakthrough in the synthesis of sila - adamantane@xcite . instead of hydrogen atoms as capping elements as in the exact silicon analogue of adamantane , silicon atoms in sila - adamantane",

    "followed by this report , piccheri reported electronic structure of  within perdew - burke - ernzerhof density functional model .",
    "he reported structural parameters calculated using the 3 - 21 g * basis sets and density fitting methodology@xcite . in the present article ,",
    "we report the electronic structure of sila - adamantane examined within the density functional theory using large polarized gaussian basis sets .",
    "furthermore , at the same level of theory we calculate vibrational frequencies , the infra - red and raman spectra .",
    "we also calculate these properties for exact silicon analogue of adamantane ( si@xmath4h@xmath6 ) , and compare them with those of sila - adamantane to examine the effect of methyl and silymethyl ligands .",
