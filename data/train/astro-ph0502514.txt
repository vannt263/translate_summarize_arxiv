    "extinct radionuclides were present in the early solar system but have now decayed below detection levels .",
    "their prior presence can be inferred from abundance variations of their daughter nuclides in meteorites . when discussing extinct radionuclides , it is convenient to use the remainder ratio , which is the ratio of the true abundance of the radioactive nuclide to the abundance it would have if it were stable @xcite , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mean - life .",
    "two different approaches can be used to estimate the remainder ratio at solar system formation .",
    "the remainder ratio in the ess can be derived from measurements of ess materials and nucleosynthesis theory , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ratio of the unstable nuclide to a neighbor stable nuclide synthesized by the same process and @xmath10 is the associated production ratio . given a gce model , it is also possible to calculate the remainder ratio in the ism at solar system formation ( @xmath11 ma for condensation of the first solids @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest gce scenario is the linear closed - box model with instantaneous recycling approximation .",
    "this model assumes that ( @xmath12 ) the galaxy formed from low metallicity gas that was turned into stars with a rate proportional to the gas density -_linear _ , ( @xmath13 ) that the galactic disk did not exchange gas with the surrounding medium -_closed - box _ , and ( @xmath14 ) that there was no delay between accretion of gas in stars and return of the nucleosynthetically enriched gas to the ism -_instantaneous recycling_. under these circumstances , it is straightforward to show that the remainder ratio of a short - lived nuclide in the ism at 4.5 gy bp is simply @xmath15 , where t is the presolar age of the galactic disk ( @xmath16 gy @xcite )",
    ". however , this simple model fails to explain important astronomical observations , notably the g - dwarf metallicity distribution .",
    "a possible solution to the g - dwarf problem is that the galactic disk accreted low - metallicity gas for an extended period of time .",
    "clayton @xcite obtained an analytical expression for the remainder ratio in the framework of a parameterized linear infall model .",
    "more recently , dauphas _",
    "@xcite improved over this model by incorporating nonlinearity in the star formation rate ( @xmath17 , with @xmath18 ) . in the later model ,",
    "the rate of infall is parameterized as a truncated gaussian with standard deviation equal to the mean . when infall of low metallicity gas is taken into account ,",
    "the remainder ratio in the ism at solar system formation is , @xmath19 where @xmath20 ( @xmath21 would correspond to the closed - box model ) @xcite .",
    "there may have been a delay between isolation of the presolar molecular cloud core from fresh nucleosynthetic inputs and condensation of the first solids in the ess .",
    "this is taken into account by introducing a free decay interval , @xmath22 .",
    "the remainder ratio in the ess is related to the remainder ratio in the ism through , @xmath23 .",
    "eliminating @xmath7 in the previous two equations , it follows that there must be a relationship between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 irrespective of their mean - lives , if extinct @xmath0-radionuclides were derived from gce with the same free decay interval , they should lie on a unique curve parameterized by the previous equation for a specific value of @xmath22 .",
    ". _ @xcite and qian _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite did a similar analysis .",
    "they concluded that @xmath2 and possibly @xmath1 would require a more extended isolation than @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath21 in fig .",
    "this discrepancy led them to suggest that two kinds of @xmath0-process events were responsible for the nucleosynthesis of neutron - rich nuclides .",
    "low ( l ) and high ( h ) frequency events would have synthesized light ( @xmath2 ) and heavy ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) @xmath0-process nuclides , respectively .",
    "this important work received renewed attention with the observations of @xmath0-process enriched low metallicity stars .",
    "@xcite analyzed the halo star cs 22892 - 052 and found that low mass @xmath0-process elements such as y and ag were deficient compared to expectations based on heavier elements .",
    "more recently , hill _",
    "@xcite determined the abundances of u , th , and eu in another halo star , cs 31082 - 001 .",
    "the age of this star based on the th / eu ratio would be lower than the age of the solar system and is inconsistent with an independent age determination based on the u / th ratio of @xmath27 ga .",
    "these observations point to multiple @xmath0-processes ( possibly as many as 3 ) .",
    "plutonium-244 has a mean life of 115.416 my .",
    "its abundance in the ess normalized to @xmath28 is @xmath29 @xcite . for most extinct @xmath0-nuclides ,",
    "it is possible to estimate production ratios based on a decomposition into @xmath0 and @xmath30-processes of the daughter nuclides @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath5 production ratio must be estimated based entirely on theoretical grounds .",
    "the main difficulty with this approach is that there are no immediate stable neighbor nuclides to anchor the models .",
    "goriely and arnould @xcite estimated uncertainties in the production of actinides . among the various models that they list , only those that yield @xmath31 and @xmath32 production ratios consistent with solar system abundances",
    "are retained @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5 production ratio is thus estimated to be @xmath33 ( cases 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 - 9 , 13 , 20 , 22 , and 30 of @xcite ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath34 is therefore @xmath35 .",
    "the remainder ratio of @xmath28 at solar system formation can be estimated in the framework of infall gce models to be @xmath36 ( 0.53 in the closed - box model ) @xcite .",
    "the remainder ratio of @xmath4 is therefore @xmath37 .",
    "the remainder ratio in the ism based on eq . [ eq2 ] is @xmath38 ( nonlinear infall model with @xmath39 @xcite ) . the free decay interval for @xmath4 ( @xmath40 ) is thus estimated to be @xmath41 my ( fig .",

    "the multiple @xmath0-process scenario as advocated by wasserburg _ et al . _ @xcite and qian _ et al . _",
    "@xcite assumes that light and heavy @xmath0-process nuclides were produced in different stellar environments .",
    "plutonium-244 should therefore follow @xmath3 , which requires a free - decay interval of @xmath48 my . although affected by large uncertainty ( stemming mainly from uncertainty in the production ratio ) , the free - decay interval of @xmath4 is closer to that of @xmath2 than it is to that of @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "1 , right panel ) .",
    "the dichotomy between light ( @xmath2 ) and heavy ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) @xmath0-nuclides may not be valid .",
    "this may indicate that actinides were synthesized in a different stellar environment ( a - events ) .",
    "there is indeed evidence for decoupling between actinides and other @xmath0-process nuclides in low - metallicity stars @xcite .",
    "another possible scenario is that the nuclides that are overabundant in the ess compared to gce expectations ( @xmath1 and @xmath3 but also @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ) were injected in the presolar molecular cloud core by the explosion of a nearby supernova ( sn ) that might have triggered the protosolar cloud into collapse . in the most recent version of the sn pollution model @xcite , it is assumed that only a fraction of the stellar ejecta is efficiently injected in the nascent solar system . for a stellar mass of 25 @xmath53 , an injection mass cut of 5 @xmath53 , and a time interval of 1 ma between the sn and incorporation in the ess , the abundances of @xmath49 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath3 are successfully reproduced while the abundances of @xmath50 and @xmath1 are slightly overproduced but this may reflect uncertainties in ess abundances and input physics @xcite . because the multiple @xmath0-processes scenario requires many stellar sources for explaining all extinct radionuclides that can not be produced by gce or irradiation in the ess while the injection scenario requires only one , the principle of occam s razor would favor the sn pollution model .",
