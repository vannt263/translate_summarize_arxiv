    "we define a _ quantum knot _ to be a linear superposition of classical knots in three dimensional space .",
    "the paper begins with a short discussion of the concept of knots and links .",
    "while there are many examples of this sort of topological pattern , we emphasize that it is indeed a mathematical pattern and has the possibility of matching models in many realms including the quantum realm .",
    "the second section of the paper gives the definition in more detail .",
    "the third section discusses a number of uses for the concept of a quantum knot . in section 4",
    "we discuss the aravind hypothesis for comparing quantum entanglement and topological entanglement , and compare it with a network model for quantum measurement .",
    "the aravind hypothesis suggests modeling observation of a topological system ( such as a link of curves in three dimensional space ) by an act of cutting and deleting one of the curves .",
    "using this method one obtains analogies between topological observation and quantum measurement .",
    "there are many discrepancies in this comparison .",
    "we detail our understanding of the situation in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we give a network model for quantum measurement , and show that it involves the act of cutting an edge of the network , and inserting a density matrix at the edge .",
    "thus there is an analogy between this model for measurement and the aravind hypothesis .",
    "sections 5 and 6 contain discussions of consequences of this point of view .",
    "the present paper uses results of previous papers @xcite of the authors , but can be read independently of them .",
    "it has been our intent here to take a number of different points of view on the notion of a quantum knot as a superposition of topologies .",
    "one can look at this notion of quantum knot as possibly describing real systems such as vortices in superfluid helium , or small molecules tunneling among different bonded states .",
    "one can also imagine notions of measurement for classical knots that might match the patterns of quantum states .",
    "and one can think of network models for worlds of interaction and try to see the relevance of topological structure to such models .",

    "this is the _ loop transform _ of the function @xmath14 to a function @xmath19 of knotted loops in three dimensional space .",
    "the loop transform is not necessarily invariant under topological moves , but this is sometimes the case .",
    "we would like to , at least at the formal level , formulate an inverse transform to the loop transform .",

    "this split between the properties of the background space and properties of the quantum states is an artifact of the rarefied form given to the algebraic description of states , but it also indicates that it is the separation properties of the topology on the background space that are implicated in a discussion of non - locality .",
    "einstein , podolsky and rosen might have argued that if two points in space are separated by disjoint open sets containing them , then they should behave as though physically independent .",
    "such a postulate of locality is really a postulate about the relationship of quantum mechanics to the topology of the background space .",
    "approaches such as roger penrose s spin networks and the more recent work of john baez , john barrett , louis crane , lee smolin , fotini markoupoulou and others suggest that spacetime structure should emerge from networks of quantum interactions occurring in a pregeometric , or process phase of physicality .",
    "in such a spin network model , there would be no separation between topological properties and quantum properties .",
    "the spin network level is already active in topological models such as the jones polynomial , the so - called quantum invariants of knots , links and three - manifolds , topological quantum field theories @xcite , and related anyonic models for quantum computing @xcite .",
    "for example , the bracket model @xcite for the jones polynomial can be realized by a generalization of the penrose @xmath114 spin nets to the quantum group @xmath115    in this paper we have placed the aravind hypothesis in the larger context of network models for quantum processes . in that context",
    "we can begin to see why there is something compelling about the hypothesis , even though it is flawed in a multiplicity of ways . in the network model",
    "a preparation and result of measurement is modeled by cutting a graphical edge of the network and inserting a density matrix ( a bra and a ket ) .",
    "this operation is remarkably close to the aravind move of cutting a component of a link .",
    "the comparison needs further study .",
    "this paper began with the general notion of a quantum knot as a superposition of classical knots .",
    "in this framework the measurment of a quantum knot produces a classical knot .",
    "we have seen that other notions of measurement lead to tantalizing and sometimes contradictory possibilities .",
    "it has been our intent to provide a wider context for this discussion . at base ,",
    "the discussion is fundamental .",
    "if the world is quantum , then there must be a dialogue that interweaves every aspect of the apparently classical with the forms of superposition and quantum measurement .",
    "we would like to replace space(time ) by a weave @xmath116 , replace the weave by a superposition of weaves @xmath117 and hence take the world itself as a quantum knot @xmath117 .",
