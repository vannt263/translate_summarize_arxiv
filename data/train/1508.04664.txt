    "up until fairly recently , most authors working with steady water waves have made the assumption that the vorticity @xmath0 of the velocity field @xmath1 vanishes identically .",
    "such waves are known as irrotational , as opposed to rotational waves where @xmath2 is allowed to be nonzero .",
    "rotational waves can exhibit more exotic behavior than irrotational ones , including interior stagnation points and critical layers of closed streamlines  @xcite .",
    "stagnation points correspond to fluid particles that are stationary with respect to the wave , and for irrotational flows this can only occur at a sharp crest  @xcite .",
    "irrotational waves are mathematically simpler to work with than rotational ones , due to the availability of the velocity potential .",
    "the velocity potential is the harmonic conjugate of the stream function , thus enabling the use of tools such as complex analysis , which are not available with nonzero vorticity .",
    "the survey @xcite treats the theory of stokes waves  an important class of irrotational waves  and the results on the so - called stokes conjecture for such waves .",
    "this conjecture was not fully settled until the appearance of the paper @xcite .",
    "the first , and still the only known , explicit nontrivial traveling wave solution to the euler equations was given in @xcite and is rotational ( which was only later pointed out by stokes ) .",
    "much later came the first existence result for small - amplitude waves with general vorticity distributions @xcite .",
    "it was not , however , before the pioneering article  @xcite that large - amplitude waves were constructed using an extension of the global bifurcation theory of rabinowitz @xcite , leading to renewed interest in rotational waves .",
    "due to the methods used , neither the waves in @xcite nor those in @xcite exhibit stagnation .",
    "the first waves with a critical layer were constructed in @xcite , having constant vorticity .",
    "a different approach was used in @xcite , allowing for wave profiles with overhang ( for which existence is still an open question , with some numerical evidence in the affirmative @xcite ) .",
    "the method of proof for the existence of nontrivial rotational waves is typically bifurcation from parallel flows with a prescribed vorticity distribution , which are described in  @xcite .",
    "other authors have looked at waves with density stratification @xcite , waves with compactly supported vorticity @xcite and waves with a general vorticity distribution and stagnation @xcite . of particular interest to us are @xcite , which cover small - amplitudes waves with an affine vorticity distribution .",
    "this is the natural step up from the constant vorticity considered in @xcite , and the resulting waves can have an arbitrary number of critical layers @xcite .    in this paper , which builds upon @xcite",
    ", we consider the same setting as in @xcite .",
    "small - amplitude solutions with an affine vorticity distribution are found by bifurcating from trivial solutions that depend naturally on three parameters . by using other choices for the bifurcation parameters in our argument",
    ", we obtain waves that , in general , are different from those found in @xcite . in order to show that these are new waves ,",
    "we are led to examine the asymptotic behavior of the bifurcation curves ; in particular for carefully chosen special cases .",
    "a complicating factor for our choice of bifurcation parameters is that they require an additional condition on the parameters .",
    "this condition can be interpreted as a nondegeneracy condition for the equation governing the dimension of the linearized problem .",
    "another novel aspect of this work is a fairly complete description of the nontrivial solutions near any trivial solution where the linear problem is one - dimensional , and for a class of trivial solutions with a two - dimensional linearized problem .",
    "we also show , by explicit construction , that the dimension of the linear problem can become arbitrary large for certain wavenumbers .",
    "this opens up the possibility for waves with arbitrarily many modes .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in we formulate the problem and describe the setting in which we will work .",
    "contains the bifurcation result for a one - dimensional kernel and gives the properties of the resulting bifurcation curves , while the final section , , covers two - dimensional bifurcation .",
    "some useful derivatives are listed in .",
    "we consider pure gravity waves . the fluid motion is assumed to be incompressible and two - dimensional , with the coordinate system oriented so that the @xmath3- and @xmath4-axes are horizontal and vertical , respectively .",
    "the fluid domain is bounded below by a flat bottom , and above by a free surface . within this",
    "setting , our aim is to construct solutions of the steady water - wave problem ; that is , to find a surface profile @xmath5 and a velocity field @xmath1 , defined in the fluid domain @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the depth of the undisturbed fluid , satisfying the euler equations    [ eq : euler ] @xmath8    in @xmath9 .",
    "the surface profile is assumed to satisfy @xmath10 , so that the bottom is not exposed to air . in and",
    "the function @xmath11 is the pressure , and @xmath12 is the velocity at which the wave travels .",
    "in addition to the equations in , we impose the boundary conditions    [ eq : euler_bc ] @xmath13    the first two boundary conditions are known as kinematic boundary conditions , and state that there is no flux through the surface or bottom .",
    "the dynamic boundary condition , , ensures that there is no jump in pressure across the free surface .",
    "we will only be searching for periodic waves , and so we introduce the wave number @xmath14 , and stipulate that all functions be @xmath15-periodic in  @xmath3 .",
    "we now reformulate the water wave problem  in terms of a potential @xmath16 , called the _ relative stream function_. from incompressibility , together with @xmath9 being simply connected , we know ( see for instance @xcite ) that there exists a function @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 this function is uniquely determined by @xmath1 , up to a constant .",
    "the kinematic boundary condition can be reformulated as @xmath19 at @xmath20 , and so @xmath16 is constant on the bottom .",
    "similarly , we can use to deduce that @xmath16 is constant also on the surface .",
    "next , and can be used to show that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the poisson bracket defined by @xmath23 furthermore , by also using the boundary conditions in , one can infer that the surface bernoulli equation @xmath24 holds for some @xmath25 .    in terms of the stream function ,",
    "the vorticity is given by @xmath26 which follows directly from the definition of vorticity in .",
    "observe also that @xmath16 is @xmath15-periodic in the horizontal variable . to see this , note that @xmath27 is also a stream function , taking the same constant values as @xmath16 on the boundary . by uniqueness , they must be identical .",
    "the motivation for introducing the stream function is that , for a prescribed vorticity , the preceding equations are in fact equivalent to the steady water - wave problem . a precise statement , taken from @xcite ,",
    "can be found in below .",
    "we will use the subscript `` per '' to denote @xmath15-periodicity in the horizontal variable , and identify @xmath28-periodic functions with functions on the circle @xmath29 .",

    "as long as the fluid velocity does not exceed the wave velocity , so that there is no stagnation , the vorticity at a point only depends on the value of the stream function at that point .",

    "observe also that the condition in is sufficient , but not necessary . by _ assuming _ the existence of a vorticity distribution , we will still obtain solutions of the water - wave problem , even if @xmath41 is not satisfied .",
    "in fact , the solutions that we will find can exhibit stagnation and critical layers .",
