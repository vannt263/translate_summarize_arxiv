    "globular clusters are densely packed , gravitationally bound systems of several thousands to about one million stars .",
    "the dimensions of the globular clusters are small compared to their distance from us : half of the light is generally emitted within a radius of less than 10  pc , whereas the closest globular cluster has a distance of 2  kpc and 90% lie more than 5  kpc away .",
    "we can thus safely assume that all stars within a globular cluster lie at the same distance from us . with ages in the order of @xmath0  years globular clusters",
    "are among the oldest objects in our galaxy .",

    "globular clusters are thus the closest approximation to a physicist s laboratory in astronomy .    the horizontal branch , which is the topic of this article , was discovered by @xcite , when he used shapley s ( * ? ? ? * ( 1915 ) ) data on m  3 and other clusters to plot magnitude versus colour ( replacing luminosity and spectral type in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ) and thus produced the first colour - magnitude diagrams ( `` farbenhelligkeitsdiagramme '' ) . in these colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmd s ) ten",
    "bruggencate noted the presence of a red giant branch that became bluer towards fainter magnitudes , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "in addition , however , he saw a horizontal branch ( `` horizontaler ast '' ) that parted from the red giant branch and extended far to the blue at constant brightness . as more cmd s of globular clusters",
    "were obtained it became obvious that the relative numbers of red and blue horizontal branch stars ( i.e.  the horizontal branch morphology ) varied quite considerably between individual clusters , with some clusters showing extensions of the blue horizontal branch ( so - called `` blue tails '' ) towards bluer colours and fainter visual magnitudes , i.e. towards hotter temperatures to temperature on one hand and by the increasing bolometric correction for hotter stars ( i.e. the maximum of stellar flux is radiated at ever shorter wavelengths for increasing temperatures , making stars fainter at @xmath1 ) on the other hand . ] .",
    "@xcite noted a correlation between the metal abundance and the horizontal branch morphology seen in globular cluster cmd s : the horizontal branch ( * hb * ) became bluer with decreasing metallicity .",
    "about 25 years after the discovery of the horizontal branch @xcite were the first to identify horizontal branch stars with post - red giant branch stars that burn helium in the central regions of their cores .",
    "@xcite managed for the first time to compute zero age horizontal branch ( * zahb * ) models that qualitatively reproduced the observed trend of hb morphology with metallicity without taking into account any mass loss but assuming a rather high helium abundance of y = 0.35 .",
    "@xcite , however , found that they could _ ``  account for the observed spread in colour along the horizontal branch by accepting that there is also a spread in stellar mass along this branch , bluer stars being less massive ( on the average ) and less luminous than redder stars . '' _ comparing hb models to observed globular cluster cmd s @xcite found that an hb that _",
    "``  is made up of stars with the same core mass and slightly varying total mass , produces theoretical c - m diagrams very similar to those observed .",
    " a mass loss of perhaps 0.2  m@xmath2 with a random dispersion of several hundredths of a solar mass is required somewhere along the giant branch . '' _ the assumption of mass loss on the red giant branch diminished the need for very high helium abundances .",
    "thus our current understanding sees horizontal branch stars as stars that burn helium in a core of about 0.5  m@xmath2  and hydrogen in a shell and evolve to the asymptotic giant branch , when the helium in the core is exhausted ( * ? ? ?",

    "observations of blue hb and blue tail stars in globular clusters support the idea of diffusion being active above a certain temperature : abundance analyses of blue hb stars cooler than 11,000  k to 12,000  k in general show no deviations from the globular cluster abundances derived from red giants , while for hotter stars departures from the general globular cluster abundances are found , e.g.  iron enrichment to solar or even super - solar values and strong helium depletion ( see moehler 2001 for references and more details ) .",

    "the gap at @xmath19 discussed by @xcite is not directly related to the @xmath14-jump as it corresponds to an effective temperature of about 9000  k and is also not seen in every cluster ( which would be expected if it were due to an atmospheric phenomenon ) .",

    "@xcite study theoretical models for the rotation of hb stars and find that the observed rotation of cool blue hb stars in m  13 can be explained if their red giant precursors have rapidly rotating cores and differential rotation in their convective envelopes and if angular momentum is redistributed from the rapidly rotating core to the envelope on the horizontal branch .",

    "additional caution is also recommended by the results of @xcite on m  13 , where even the use of the metal - rich model atmospheres does not eliminate the problem of the low masses or the low gravities for effective temperatures between 12,000  k and 16,000  k. in that cluster we also found significant disagreement between atmospheric parameters derived from strmgren photometry or from balmer line fitting for stars cooler than about 9,000  k , for which we found no explanation .",
