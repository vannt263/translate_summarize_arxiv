    "<S> two types of parametric processes are concerned in these applications , spontaneous one and stimulated one , depending on different initial conditions . in spontaneous parametric processes , only pump light is injected into nonlinear media , and signal and idler photons are generated from the vacuum fluctuation with quantum correlation / entanglement . in stimulated parametric processes , not only the pump light but also seeded photons are injected into nonlinear media , and new pairs of photons would be generated , correlated with the seeded photons . </S>",
    "<S> both the two types can be used for quantum information processing , for example , the spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) has been widely used to generate various photonic quantum states @xcite , providing an important way to realize photonic quantum states , and the stimulated parametric down conversion has been utilized to realize optimal quantum optical cloning @xcite and quantum not gate @xcite and to generate multi - photon entangled states @xcite .    in recent years , the applications of four wave mixing processes in photonic quantum information processing have attracted much attention , since they can be realized in third - order waveguides such as optical fibers and silicon wire waveguides , which can be operated at telecom band and are well compatible with developed technologies of optical communications and integrated optoelectronics @xcite . in the four wave mixing process , </S>",

    "<S> the stimulated signal photons are in the same mode with the seeded signal photons , and the idler photons are also correlated with the two signal photons . </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , usually the frequency difference between the signal / idler photons and the pump light is small in four wave mixing processes , which leads to difficulties in noise photon suppression . </S>",
