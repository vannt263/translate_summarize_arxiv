    "the intrinsic distribution of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) is determined by two elements .",
    "first , there is the period distribution of newly formed cvs , i.e.  the distribution of the periods at which the late - type secondary star starts to transfer mass on to the white dwarf primary via roche lobe overflow for the first time .",
    "secondly , there is the secular evolution of cvs from this period that is governed by continuous angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking and gravitational radiation , which decreases the binary separation and thus the orbital period for non - degenerate secondary stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as cvs that are born with periods",
    "@xmath5 evolve below this point the secondary star becomes fully convective .",
    "it is generally thought that as a consequence magnetic braking stops to operate or at least becomes much less efficient , causing the system to become detached until it restarts mass transfer at @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the result is a paucity of cvs with periods between @xmath02 and 3 h , the so - called period gap . finally , the minimum period at @xmath080 min represents the turn - around point when the secondary star becomes degenerate and the cv now evolves , very slowly , back to longer orbital periods due to the inverted mass - radius relation .",
    "modelling predicts that most cvs have orbital periods between @xmath080 min and 2 h @xcite .",
    "although modern surveys have unveiled more of the intrinsic cv population ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the currently observed period distribution is still affected by a strong observational bias .",
    "the latter includes a mixture of factors , but the main contributors will be the brightness of the cv and frequency and amplitude of the variability . with increasing mass - transfer rate @xmath7 the amplitude of the dwarf nova outbursts decreases , but the frequency increases , and also the brightness of the accretion disc , which is the dominant light source in most cvs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "since @xmath7 for systems above the gap exceeds the one for cvs below it by one to two orders of magnitude @xcite , these are the objects that are favoured by the observational bias .",
    "classical novae are cvs that undergo a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of the white dwarf due to the accreted mass having reached a critical value @xcite .",
    "the underlying binary is not destroyed by the nova eruption and mass transfer is reestablished on time - scales not longer than one or two years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nova eruptions can thus be assumed to be recurrent events .",
    "the recurrence time in classical novae is estimated to be @xmath8 @xcite . while it is not yet entirely clear how strongly other parameters like magnetic fields or the chemical compositions affect @xmath9 , the most important factors have been shown to be @xmath7 , the internal temperature of the white dwarf @xmath10 and its mass @xmath11 . however , @xmath11 is mainly independent of @xmath12 @xcite , and while @xcite have shown that @xmath10 is an important factor in the shaping of the orbital period distribution , @xcite find that @xmath10 depends on the long - term average @xmath7 .",
    "it is thus reasonable to assume that the latter represents the overall most important factor for the nova period distribution .",
    "since the highest values for @xmath7 are found in cvs with @xmath13 @xcite , one would expect that the observed period distribution for novae shows a strong maximum at such periods .",
    "detailed calculations by @xcite show that roughly 50 per cent of the novae should have orbital periods in this range .",
    "@xcite analyse the influence of several observational selection effects , but find that they do not strongly affect the overall shape of the period distribution .",
    "the main problem with comparing theoretically derived period distributions to the actually observed one is that the latter is still significantly undersampled .",
    "the current edition of the @xcite catalogue ( update 7.20 ) lists only 69 post - novae with unambiguous periods .",
    "the problem of undersampling extends to all aspects of post - nova research , which motivated us to start a project to select candidates for ` lost ' post - novae via colour - colour diagrams , to confirm the post - nova spectroscopically , and to derive the orbital period for suitable , i.e.  sufficiently bright systems ( * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath23 passband differs significantly from the bessel @xmath2 filter curve , leading to systematic offsets between the two magnitudes depending on the spectral energy distribution of the object . from our comparison to several field stars , we estimate a typical uncertainty of @xmath24 mag regarding this offset .",
    "we derive corresponding values for the @xmath17 values for the comparison with earlier observations by correcting for the @xmath25 colour derived elsewhere .",

    "however , with respect to the brightness differences observed in the present work and the previously reported colours of novae , e.g.  by @xcite and , we do not expect such change to exceed @xmath00.1 mag .",

    "a large number of our objects show comparatively weak and broad emission lines . additionally , due to the faintness of the objects and the necessarily short exposure times , the spectroscopic data have a low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) typically not higher than @xmath26 .",
    "this presents significant difficulties for measuring the radial velocity displacement of the h@xmath3 emission line by fitting a gaussian function to it .",

    "* ) than a mathematical function .",
    "a few spectra ( e.g.  for ar cir ) that present more gaussian line profiles and good",
    "s / n allowed for a comparison of the two methods , and we found the respective results to agree well with each other .",

    "thus , in a coordinate system that has its point of origin in the centre - of - mass and whose axis connects the eclipsed continuum source ( at @xmath62 ) with the eclipsing source ( at @xmath63 ) , the h@xmath3 emission source is located at @xmath043@xmath64 ( clockwise ) . identifying the eclipsing source with the secondary star implies a rather unusual location for the h@xmath3 emitter . a bright spot , for example , would be expected at @xmath0135@xmath64 .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the carbon content in cvs and pre - cvs is a potential indicator of the evolutionary status of the binary and especially the secondary star , which has motivated several corresponding studies .",
    "however , to our knowledge this particular cii emission has never been observed before in a cv with the exception of v445 pup , where it originates in the expelled nova shell @xcite , while in v972 oph it is clearly situated in the binary itself .",
    "a favourable factor in its detection is certainly the comparatively narrow and weak h@xmath3 emission line .",
    "this raises the question if the presence of ( perhaps slightly weaker ) cii in other cvs is not simply masked by the typically broad and strong h@xmath3 line . in fig .",
    "[ haprof_fig ] , we compare the line profiles of the seven novae . to account for the different line strengths we have normalized the spectra with respect to the maximum intensity of the line . on the left - hand side of the plot we have collected the ` carbon suspects ' , i.e.  the novae that show a certain extra flux near 6580  .",
    "apart from v972 oph these are v365 car , ar cir and cn vel .",
    "the line profiles of the remaining three novae in the right - hand plot of the figure show more symmetric wings , although the line in v373 sct is certainly sufficiently broad to hide potentially present weak cii .",
    "the inclusion of ar cir in this list demonstrates that a red extended h@xmath3 emission wing can also indicate the presence of an outflow rather than cii emission .",
    "considering that evidence for such outflow has been detected for several cvs in ultraviolet lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) but also in h@xmath3 and hei @xcite , this represents perhaps an even more likely explanation .",
    "additionally , the outflow phenomenon in cvs appears to be most commonly found in systems with high @xmath7 and most post - novae certainly fall into that category .",
    "however , assuming that such outflows are bipolar @xcite we would then expect to find a blueshifted counterpart either in absorption ( for an optically thick outflow ) or in emission ( for an optically thin outflow as has been recently detected in vy scl ; schmidtobreick et al . ,",
    "mnras , submitted ) .",
    "apart from ar cir , in none of the other targets any such component can be detected in our data , but on the other hand a ( weak ) absorption component could be easily masked by the principal h@xmath3 emission line .",
    "the data presented here were obtained with the intention to determine the orbital periods of the seven novae , and they served this purpose well .",
    "a closer inspection reveals interesting phenomena in a number of systems , but the limited quality of the data mostly allows only a glimpse at them and often raises more question than answers .",
    "several of the novae here merit further investigation , and we hope that the present work motivates more detailed studies .",
    "we thank elena mason and antonio bianchini for discussion on the spectrum of v972 oph and roberto saito for comments regarding the vvv infrared data on several novae .",
