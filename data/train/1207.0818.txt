    "exoplanet studies over the last @xmath10 years have demonstrated that at least @xmath11 of fgk stars harbor gas giant planets , with many of them at surprisingly small separations , implying inward migration after formation @xcite .",
    "although the mechanism by which most planets migrate is not understood , powerful constraints on proposed theories of migration can be established by determining the orbital properties of planets at young or adolescent ages ( @xmath12  gyr ) .",
    "for example , if migration occurs primarily due to interactions with a circumstellar disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the migration must occur before the disk dissipates ( @xmath13  myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is predicted to circularize orbits .",
    "alternatively , if migration occurs primarily due to planet - planet scattering ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the process may take hundreds of millions of years to occur and can produce highly eccentric orbits , prior to any tidal circularization ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "a direct way to find planets that can potentially be used to constrain theories of migration is to search for them in young open clusters .",
    "however , until now , only @xmath6 open cluster stars were known to harbor planets ",
    "tau in the hyades @xcite and tyc 5409 - 2156 - 1 in ngc 2423 @xcite  both of which are giant stars and thus , by necessity , have planets on wider orbits than those occupied by hot jupiters . in both cases",
    "the host stars are of intermediate mass ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , likely a or b type stars when on the main sequence .",
    "the lack of detected planets orbiting fgk main sequence stars ( which are often referred to as sun - like stars ) in open clusters has remained despite radial velocity ( rv ) suveys of @xmath17 dwarfs in the metal - rich hyades ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mean @xmath18}=+0.13 $ ] ) and @xmath19 dwarfs in m67 @xcite , as well as numerous transit searches in other clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the lack of detections may still be the result of small sample sizes ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , millimeter - wave studies of disks around stars in the orion star forming region , which may evolve into an open cluster , offer a plausible astrophysical explanation .",
    "@xcite find that most solar - type stars in this region do not possess disks massive enough to form gas giant planets .",
    "one may also speculate that for the few stars capable of forming planets , the remaining disk masses may be insufficient to permit inward migration ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in an attempt to ( 1 ) more confidently determine whether planet formation and/or migration is inhibited around stars within clusters , and ( 2 ) potentially discover planets with known ages and measurable orbital properties , we have carried out an rv survey of stars in the praesepe open cluster . here",
    "we present the seminal result of that survey - the discovery of the first @xmath6 hot jupiters orbiting sun - like stars in a cluster .",
    "stars were selected from the praesepe open cluster because it is relatively nearby ( @xmath20 ) , has @xmath21 known members , a well determined age ( 600 myr ; * ? ? ?",

    "its high metallicity is important because giant planet frequency is strongly correlated with host star metallicity @xcite ; a metallicity as high as @xmath22 dex implies an increase in the giant planet frequency of a factor of nearly @xmath23 relative to solar metallicity .",
    "if this correlation applies to open cluster stars , as many as @xmath24 in @xmath25 praesepe stars could harbor a hot jupiter , and @xmath24 in @xmath26 could host a transiting giant planet .",
    "cluster members were selected from the membership list assembled by @xcite , excluding stars with known spectroscopic or visual companions @xcite . to ensure the velocity precision would be sufficient to detect substellar companions , we limited our initial search to slowly rotating , bright stars ( @xmath27 ; @xmath28 ) . after applying these cuts ,",

    "precise wavelength calibration was estaiblished by obtaining thar emission - line spectra before and after each spectrum , through the same fiber as the science exposures .",

    "the rms of the hd 65583 rvs was @xmath67 , with internal errors of only @xmath68 .",
