    "observations of type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite all indicate that the universe is undergoing an accelerating expansion .",
    "this implies the existence of a mysterious component , called dark energy @xcite , which has negative pressure and takes the largest proportion of the total density in the present universe . in the past fifteen years , lots of efforts @xcite have been made to understand dark energy , yet we still know little about its nature .",
    "in this paper we focus on the holographic dark energy model , which is a quantum gravity approach to the dark energy problem @xcite . in this model",
    ", the vacuum energy is viewed as dark energy , and is related to the event horizon of the universe when we require that the zero - point energy of the system should not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same size @xcite . in this way , we have the holographic dark energy density @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath4 is a dimensionless phenomenological parameter which plays an important role in determining the properties of the holographic dark energy , @xmath12 is the reduced planck mass , and @xmath13 is the ir cutoff length scale of the effective quantum field theory , which is taken to be the future event horizon of the universe , @xmath14 , in the holographic model proposed by li @xcite , defined as @xmath15 the holographic dark energy model has been proven to be a competitive and promising dark energy candidate .",
    "it can theoretically explain the coincidence problem @xcite , and is proven to be perturbational stable @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is favored by the observational data @xcite . for more studies on the holographic dark energy model ,",
    "see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is fairly difficult to calculate the cosmological perturbations of dark energy in the holographic dark energy model , because there is a non - local effect making the calculation of perturbations extremely hard to treat .",
    "thus , in the past , for the cmb observations , only the wmap `` distance priors '' data were used to constrain the holographic dark energy model in order to avoid the inclusion of the perturbations of dark energy ( see e.g. refs .",
    "however , recently , it has been realized that , in order to make progress one should first ignore the non - local effect in the holographic dark energy model and directly calculate the perturbations of holographic dark energy as if it is a usual dynamical dark energy . alone",
    "this line , in a recent work @xcite , a global fitting analysis on the holographic dark energy model was performed .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite the treatment of the gravity instability problem concerning the phantom divide crossing is absent . in this paper",
    ", we shall perform a global fit analysis on the holographic dark energy model with spatial curvature and massive neutrinos . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the numerical studies of dynamical dark energy should include the spatial curvature @xmath6 as a free parameter to be fitted alongside the equation - of - state parameter ( eos ) @xmath16 of dark energy .",
    "in addition , the total mass of neutrinos @xmath10 is also tightly correlated with @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "so , in our work , based on a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) global fit technique , we will consider spatial curvature and massive neutrinos in the holographic dark energy model , and will deeply analyze the influences of these two factors on the fitting results . for a dynamical dark energy model , one must be careful about the treatment of perturbations in dark energy when @xmath16 crosses @xmath17 . in this work , following the wmap team , we use the `` parameterized post - friedmann '' ( ppf ) approach @xcite implemented in the camb code .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we derive the basic equations for the holographic dark energy in a universe with spatial curvature and massive neutrinos . in section [ sec:3 ] ,",
    "we discuss the holographic dark energy in a background universe and also in a perturbed universe , and then we make a global fit analysis on the models . at last , some concluding remarks are given in section [ sec:4 ] . in this work ,",
    "we assume today s scale factor @xmath18 , so the redshift @xmath19 satisfies @xmath20 ; the subscript `` 0 '' always indicates the present value of the corresponding quantity , and the unit with @xmath21 is used .",
    "in this section , we derive the basic equations for the holographic dark energy model with spatial curvature and massive neutrinos .",
    "then we briefly introduce the ppf description of dark energy perturbations .      in a spatially non - flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe",
    ", the friedmann equation can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the effective energy density of the curvature component , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the energy dinsity of dark matter , dark energy , baryon , massive neutrinos and radiation , respectively .",
    "notice that we adopt the approximate method used in the five - year analysis of wmap @xcite : dividing neutrino component into the relativistic neutrinos and the massive neutrinos , and including the relativistic neutrinos into radiation component . for convenience ,",
    "we define the fractional energy densities of the various components , @xmath29 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath30    in addition , the energy conservation equations for the various components are in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 for dark matter , baryons and massive neutrinos , @xmath33 for relativistic components , @xmath34 for curvature and @xmath35 for dark energy .",
    "note that , in this paper , a over dot always denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath36 . combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : allomega ] ) and ( [ eq : ec ] ) gives @xmath37 which together with energy conservation equation ( [ eq : ec ] ) for dark energy gives @xmath38    in a non - flat universe , the ir cut - off length scale @xmath13 takes the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 with @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 for @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 , respectively . from the energy density of the holographic dark energy , we have @xmath47 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : l1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : l0 ] ) and taking derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq : l0 ] ) with respect to @xmath36 , one can get @xmath48    combining eq .",
    "( [ eq : oh2 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ol1.3 ] ) , we finally obtain the following two equations governing the dynamical evolution of the holographic dark energy in a universe with spatial curvature and massive neutrinos , @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the dimensionless hubble expansion rate , and @xmath52 the initial conditions are @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "note also that @xmath55 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the reduced hubble constant , and @xmath10 is the sum of neutrino masses . in addition , the value of @xmath58 is determined by the wmap 7-yr observations @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the effective number of neutrino species .",
    "thus , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : oh3 ] ) and ( [ eq : oh4 ] ) can be solved numerically , and will be used in the data analysis procedure .    in this paper , we shall consider the following four cases : ( a ) the model of holographic dark energy without spatial curvature and massive neutrinos ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) , denoted as hde ; ( b ) the model of holographic dark energy with spatial curvature but without massive neutrinos ( @xmath63 but @xmath64 ) , denoted as khde ; ( c ) the model of holographic dark energy with massive neutrinos but without spatial curvature ( @xmath65 but @xmath61 ) , denoted as vhde ; ( d ) the model of holographic dark energy with spatial curvature and massive neutrinos ( @xmath63 and @xmath66 ) , denoted as kvhde .      in this work we calculate the linear metric and matter density perturbations by using the formalism of ma and bertschinger @xcite . also , we are very careful about the treatment of the divergence problem @xcite for the dark energy perturbations when @xmath16 crosses @xmath17 . following the wmap team , we deal with this issue by using the ppf code @xcite .",
    "this code supports a time - dependent eos @xmath16 that is allowed to cross @xmath17 multiple times @xcite for the dark energy perturbations .",
    "moreover , it has been widely used in the literature to deal with the perturbations of dark energy ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    now , we shall first briefly review the ppf description of dark energy perturbations @xcite .",
    "the perturbations of dark energy can be described by the following four variables , density fluctuation @xmath67 , velocity @xmath68 , pressure fluctuation @xmath69 , and anisotropic stress @xmath70 .",
    "the evolution equations of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are given by corresponding continuity and navier - stokes equations , and @xmath70 vanishes for linear perturbations . to complete the system",
    ", one needs to specify the relationship between @xmath69 and @xmath67 , which defines a sound speed @xmath71 , where `` rest '' denotes the dark energy rest frame . in an arbitrary gauge",
    ", one can obtain @xmath72 where @xmath73 with @xmath74 the wave number in the fourier space .",
    "however , evidently , a gravity instability appears in the evolution of perturbations because of the divergence of @xmath75 , when @xmath16 crosses the phantom divide ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the ppf description replaces this condition on the pressure perturbations with a direct relationship between the momentum density of the dark energy and that of other components on large scales , namely , @xmath77 where @xmath78 ,  @xmath79 \" denotes all other components excluding the dark energy , and @xmath80 is a function of time only .",
    "the ppf description can make an exact match at large scales to any given system with an arbitrary @xmath16 by solving the full equations at @xmath81 and inferring @xmath80 for the evolution of all other finite @xmath74 modes .",
    "however , it is sufficient for most purposes to simply take @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "note that once @xmath68 is determined , @xmath69 follows by momentum conservation with no singularities encountered as @xmath16 crosses the phantom divide .",
    "besides , ppf description of dark energy gives the density and momentum components of dark energy with a single joint dynamical variable @xmath83 . here",
    "we directly give these two relationships in the synchronous gauge , @xmath84,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 and @xmath86 { ( v_t + k \\alpha ) \\over k_h}.\\ ] ] here @xmath87 and @xmath88 with @xmath57 and @xmath89 the metric perturbations in the synchronous gauge .",
    "at last , to assure that the dark energy becomes smooth relative to the matter inside a transition scale @xmath90 while exactly conserving energy and momentum locally , one takes @xmath91= s , \\label{eqn : gammaeom}\\ ] ] where the free parameter @xmath92 gives the transition scale between the large scales and small scales in terms of the hubble scale , whose value needs to be calibrated in practice .",
    "it is found that @xmath93 could match the evolution of scalar field models @xcite .",
    "note that the ppf approach does nt define a sound speed @xmath94 for dark energy , but its value may indirectly influence the perturbations of dark energy , since we adopt @xmath93 .",
    "the possible influences of @xmath94 on the amplitude of dark energy perturbations can be found in refs .",
    "as long as @xmath94 is close to 1 , the dark energy does not cluster significantly on sub - horizon scales . therefore ,",
    "following the treatment in the camb and cmbfast codes , in our analysis we set @xmath94 to be 1 .",
    "for the details about the ppf approach , we refer the reader to refs .",
    "note that the camb einstein - boltzmann package has been modified to include ppf @xcite and a version for dark energy has been made publically available . in our calculations ,",
    "the initial condition for the dynamical variable @xmath83 of ppf is set to be zero and the adiabatic initial conditions are taken for other variables .",
    "in this section , we shall make a global fit analysis on the holographic dark energy models considered above .",
    "we modify the mcmc package `` cosmomc '' @xcite to do the numerical calculations .",
    "our most general parameter space vector is : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 , @xmath98 is the ratio ( multiplied by 100 ) of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath99 is the optical depth to re - ionization , @xmath4 is the phenomenological parameter of the holographic dark energy model , @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the amplitude and the spectral index of the primordial scalar perturbation power spectrum . for the pivot scale ,",
    "we set @xmath102mpc@xmath103 to be consistent with the wmap team @xcite .     in the holographic dark energy model . as an example",
    ", we show the cases with @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 . for a comparison , the case in the @xmath107cdm model",
    "is also plotted . for the other model parameters ,",
    "we adopt their best - fit values given by the wmap 7-yr observations.,width=302 ]    in the computation of the cmb anisotropy , we include the wmap 7-yr temperature and polarization power spectra @xcite with the routine for computing the likelihood supplied by the wmap team @xcite . for the snia ,",
    "we make use of the recently released 580 snia data from the `` union2.1 '' sample @xcite , where the systematic errors of snia are included in our analysis . for the lss information",
    ", we use the bao data from the sdss dr7 @xcite and wigglez dark energy survey @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also use the latest hubble space telescope ( hst ) measurement of the hubble constant , @xmath108  km  s@xmath103  mpc@xmath103 @xcite .    before constraining the model parameter space",
    ", we study the effects of the phenomenological parameter @xmath4 on the background evolution , cmb power spectrum , and structure growth , by setting different @xmath4 and fixing the other model parameters . for simplicity ,",
    "in these examples we only consider the holographic dark energy model in a flat universe .",
    "first , let us have a look at the background evolution .",
    "the parameter @xmath4 in the holographic dark energy model plays a very significant role in determining the dynamical evolution of dark energy ; for details see ref .  @xcite .",
    "in order to see the influence of @xmath4 on the dynamics of expansion of the universe , we plot the evolution of @xmath109 for the holographic dark energy model in fig .  [",
    "fig : ez ] .",
    "we take the values of @xmath4 to be 0.7 , 1.0 , and 1.5 , as examples .",
    "we also plot the evolution of the @xmath107cdm model for a comparison in this figure . for the other model parameters ,",
    "we adopt their best - fit values given by the wmap 7-yr observations  @xcite . from this figure",
    ", we can see that different @xmath4 values in the holographic model lead to distinctly different expansion histories .",
    "however , taking an appropriate value for @xmath4 , such as @xmath104 , the holographic dark energy model will produce a nearly indistinguishable background expansion history with the @xmath107cdm model .",
    "next , we want to see the situations in a perturbed universe",
    ". the results of the cmb @xmath110 power spectrum in the holographic dark energy model are shown in fig .",
    "[ cmbfig ] . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the results of the xcdm models with different constant @xmath16 .",
    "one can see that , for the holographic models with different @xmath4 , the main difference appears at low ( @xmath111 ) multipole momentum parts which correspond to large scales . as seen in this figure , a smaller @xmath4 will yield a smaller @xmath110 at low @xmath112 . besides , since the eos of the holographic dark energy satisfies @xmath113 @xcite , a smaller @xmath4 will give a smaller @xmath16 .",
    "so for the hde model , a smaller @xmath16 will lead to a smaller @xmath110 at low @xmath112 .",
    "similarly , for the xcdm model , a smaller @xmath16 will also lead to a smaller @xmath110 at low @xmath112 .",
    "thus , the results of the hde and xcdm models are consistent with each other .",
    "we also notice that , for the cmb temperature angular power spectrum , the holographic dark energy model with @xmath104 can also produce a roughly same result with the @xmath107cdm model .",

    "the behavior of the density perturbations outside the horizon is strongly gauge - dependent . in the synchronous gauge , all the @xmath117 s before horizon",
    "crossing grow .",
    "after horizon crossing , the perturbations come into causal contact and become nearly independent of the coordinate choices . for the cold dark",
    "matter , after the horizon crossing the fluctuations still monotonously grow . the mode with @xmath116 mpc@xmath103 enters the horizon before recombination , so the baryons together with the photons oscillate acoustically while they are coupled by thomson scattering .",
    "the baryons decouple from the photons at the recombination and then fall very quickly into the potential wells formed around the cold dark matter , resulting in the rapid growth of @xmath118 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] . for the holographic dark energy , we see clearly that after the horizon crossing , the fluctuations in dark energy decrease quickly .",
    "so , the dark energy does not cluster significantly on the sub - horizon size . during the expansion of the universe",
    ", @xmath119 is always smaller than @xmath120 by several orders of magnitude , so the dark energy perturbations almost do not affect the evolution of cold dark matter perturbations .",
    "hence , the impact of holographic dark energy on the evolution of dark matter perturbations is almost only from the background evolution . in the @xmath107cdm model ,",
    "the cosmological constant does not produce fluctuations , so its impact on the evolution of dark matter density fluctuations is exactly from the background evolution .    in order to know more about the large - scale structure in the holographic dark energy model , we plot the evolution of dark matter density perturbations and matter power spectrum with different @xmath4 values in fig .  [",
    "fig : deltac ] . from the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : deltac ] , we can directly see the impact of the value of @xmath4 on the growth of structure .",
    "again , we take the case of @xmath116 mpc@xmath103 as an example . once the accelerated",
    "expansion begins , the growth of linear perturbations effectively tends to end , since the hubble damping time becomes shorter than the timescale for perturbation growth . for larger @xmath4 and",
    "fixed present dark energy density @xmath121 , dark energy comes to dominate earlier , causing the growth of linear perturbations to end earlier ; this explains the amplitude of perturbation with smaller @xmath4 is larger at all redshifts until today . in the right panel of fig .",

    "we find that the impact of @xmath4 on the small scales is slightly larger than that on the large scales .",
    "we also make a comparison with the @xmath107cdm model .",
    "it is found that the hde model with @xmath104 and the @xmath107cdm model produce the almost undistinguishable matter power spectra .",

    "so , we believe that the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath10 should be in positive correlation . indeed , in the kvhde model , we find that the result is in accordance with the expectation .",
    "in addition , when simultaneously considering spatial curvature and massive neutrinos in the holographic dark energy model , the parameter space of @xmath151 is greatly amplified .",
    "for example , the upper bound of @xmath10 is enlarged by more than 2 times comparing to the vhde model .",
    "cl contours , for the kvhde model.,width=642 ]    an interesting phenomenon in table [ table1 ] is that the marginalized ranges of some cosmological parameters narrow when we add additional parameters . for example , compared with the hde and khde models , the upper error bars of @xmath4 shrink when we add @xmath152 in the vhde and kvhde models .",
    "this phenomenon is understandable . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kvhde ] , we saw that a larger neutrino mass favors a smaller @xmath4 , thus adding @xmath10 into the fit will drag @xmath4 to smaller values and shrink its upper error bars .",
    "similar phenomenon also appears in other parameters . due to the negative correlation with @xmath153",
    ", we find narrow upper error bars of @xmath154 in the vhde and kvhde models , and the narrow upper error bars of @xmath101 in khde and kvhde models are due to its negative correlation with @xmath6 .",
    "is not our major focus , its contours are not plotted . ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : ttpower - bf ] , we plot the cmb @xmath110 power spectra for the hde , khde , vhde and kvhde models with the corresponding best - fit parameters . to make a comparison",
    ", we also include the @xmath107cdm model with the best - fit parameters given by the same set of data .",
    "it can be seen that the @xmath110 power spectra for the holographic dark energy are well inside the error bars of the observational data given by the wmap 7-yr measurements and match the @xmath107cdm model very well .",
    "power spectra for the hde , khde , vhde and kvhde models with the corresponding best - fit parameter values .",
    "the black dots with error bars denote the observed data with their corresponding uncertainties from wmap 7-yr results .",
    ", width=302 ]    now , let us discuss the cosmological consequence of introducing spatial curvature and massive neutrinos in the holographic dark energy model .",
    "we are interested in the impacts of these factors on the eos of dark energy and the fate of the universe .",
    "note that , if the spatial curvature is involved in the model , the eos of the holographic dark energy reads @xmath155 in the far future ( @xmath156 ) , it is clear that @xmath157 and @xmath158 , and so we still have @xmath159 .",
    "hence , even though the spatial curvature is involved , we still hold the conclusion that @xmath1 leads to a big rip future singularity while for @xmath160 this singularity is avoided .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : wde ] , we plot the evolution of @xmath16 along with redshift @xmath19 , including the best - fit results , as well as the 14@xmath137 regions , for the considered models . as seen in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : wde ] , for the holographic dark energy models without spatial curvature , @xmath16 will cross @xmath17 at more than @xmath2 cl . as mentioned above , this means that the future universe will be dominated by phantom energy and will end up with a `` big rip '' singularity at more than @xmath2 cl . as seen in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : wde ] , after introducing the spatial curvature , @xmath16 will cross @xmath17 only in about @xmath3 range .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of spatial curvature in the holographic dark energy model may be helpful to alleviate the future cosmic doomsday problem .",
    "in contrast , the inclusion of massive neutrinos does not have significant influence on the evolution of @xmath161 .",
    "along with redshift @xmath19 , including the best - fit results , as well as the 14@xmath137 regions , for the considered models.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   along with redshift @xmath19 , including the best - fit results , as well as the 14@xmath137 regions , for the considered models.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   along with redshift @xmath19 , including the best - fit results , as well as the 14@xmath137 regions , for the considered models.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   along with redshift @xmath19 , including the best - fit results , as well as the 14@xmath137 regions , for the considered models.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    we also notice that the phantom behavior of the hde model is different from many other models .",
    "the holographic dark energy is of phantom type at very high confidence levels .",
    "this is different from the 2- or 3- parametric scalar field dark energy models , chaplygin gas models , divergence - free parametrization models , and so forth , where the phantom type of dark energy fits the same data only slightly better than the quintessence or cosmological constant models @xcite .",
    "this difference is due to the particular behavior of @xmath16 in the hde model . in the hde model , there is always @xmath162 at high redshifts .",
    "however , from cosmological observations we know that on average there is @xmath163 .",
    "thus , to fit the data , @xmath164 is expected at low redshifts .",
    "we are also interested in the differences between the cosmological constraints given by the wmap 7-yr `` distance priors '' and those given by the full wmap 7-yr data . as an example , we plot the marginalized 13@xmath137 cl contours in the @xmath4@xmath6 plane , for the khde model , in fig .",
    "[ fig : omnuhsq_c ] .",
    "the pink contours are plotted by using the wmap `` distance priors '' , and the olive contours are plotted by using the full wmap data . as seen in this figure , the regions of the 13@xmath137 contours given by the full wmap data are significantly smaller than the corresponding regions given by the wmap `` distance priors '' . therefore , making use of the full wmap data can give better constraints on the holographic dark energy model , compared with the case using the wmap `` distance priors '' .",
    "cl contours in the @xmath4-@xmath6 plane , for the khde model .",
    "the pink contours are plotted by using the wmap distance priors , and the olive contours are plotted by using the full wmap 7-yr data.,width=302 ]",
    "in this paper we considered the holographic dark energy model with spatial curvature and massive neutrinos .",
    "it is well known that both the spatial curvature and neutrino mass are correlated with the dark energy eos , so it is important to study the influences of these factors to the holographic dark energy .",
    "in addition , it is also rather significant to consider the cosmological perturbations in holographic dark energy and make a global fit analysis on the holographic dark energy model .",
    "we placed constraints on the holographic dark energy in a universe with spatial curvature and massive neutrinos , based on a mcmc global fit technique .",
    "the cosmic observational data include the wmap 7-yr temperature and polarization data , the snia data from union2.1 sample , the bao data from sdss dr7 and wigglez dark energy survey , and the latest measurements of @xmath0 from hst . in order to treat the perturbations in dark energy",
    "when @xmath16 crosses @xmath17 , we employed the ppf approach .",
    "so , we do not suffer from the divergence problem when @xmath16 crosses @xmath17 .",
    "we found that , for the simplest hde model , the phenomenological parameter @xmath1 at more than @xmath2 cl , showing that the future universe will be dominated by phantom dark energy at more than @xmath2 cl . after taking into account spatial curvature ,",
    "we have @xmath1 only in about @xmath3 range , implying that the inclusion of spatial curvature in the holographic dark energy model may be helpful to alleviate the future doomsday problem .",
    "in contrast , the inclusion of massive neutrinos does not have significant influence on the phenomenological parameter @xmath4 .    for the khde model",
    ", we found that the 2@xmath137 range of the spatial curvature is @xmath142 ; moreover , the @xmath5 error bars of @xmath6 are still fairly small , also in order of @xmath7 . for the vhde model",
    ", we obtained the result that the @xmath8 upper bound of the total mass of neutrinos is @xmath9 ev , which is the first result of neutrino mass in the holographic dark energy model .",
    "moreover , when simultaneously considering spatial curvature and massive neutrinos , the upper bound of @xmath10 will be enlarged by more than 2 times .",
    "furthermore , we also demonstrated that , making use of the full wmap 7-yr data can give better constraints on the holographic dark energy model , compared with the case using the wmap `` distance priors '' .",
    "it should be mentioned that , there are still some factors not covered in our paper , e.g. , the possible interaction between dark sectors .",
    "evidently , when taking into account the interaction , the computation of the dark sector perturbations will become much more complicated .",
    "these issues deserve further investigations in the future work .",
