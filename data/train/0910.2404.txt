    "the dynamics of solid particles dispersed in host fluids is an important problem in many different fields of science and engineering . the macroscopic properties of such dispersions ( the elastic modulus , viscosity , and thermal and electric conductivities ) greatly depend on the dynamics of the particles in the host fluids . in equilibrium states ,",
    "the dynamics of small dispersed particles are strongly affected by the thermal fluctuations of their host fluids .",
    "when flow is imposed , the dynamics are also affected by the flow of the host fluids . because it is difficult to experimentally analyze these complex particle dynamics , which are coupled both to thermal fluctuations and to fluid flow , numerical simulations are particularly important for understanding the properties of particle dispersions in detail @xcite .    for a single brownian chain fluctuating in the shear flow of a newtonian fluid , it has been suggested that the tumbling frequency @xmath10 is proportional to the shear rate @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this has been experimentally confirmed by schroeder , teixeira , shaqfeh , and chu @xcite for the dynamics of individual dna molecules in a linear shear flow .",
    "primarily , smith , babcock , and chu @xcite measured the power spectral density ( psd ) and the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the extension length of each dna molecule for various weissenberg numbers @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the shear rate and @xmath14 is the relaxation time of the chain orientation .",
    "the psd of polymer extension exhibits no peaks . in subsequent experiments",
    "@xcite , however , the focus has been put on the psd of the orientation angle @xmath15 , where @xmath16 when the dna molecule lies perfectly in the flow direction .",
    "these experimental results support a simple power law , @xmath17 , where @xmath10 is the peak frequency of the psd .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath14 is considered to be a constant if the temperature is constant .",
    "this leads to @xmath18 .",
    "similar results have also been obtained in other experiments @xcite , numerical simulations @xcite , and theoretical analyses @xcite .",
    "although the dna molecules mentioned above can be considered flexible chains , a quite similar power law was obtained using numerical simulations for a brownian linear rigid rod as well @xcite .    for a single non - brownian ( thermally non - fluctuating ) flexible chain in shear flow , the tumbling frequency @xmath10",

    ", one would expect to observe a crossover from brownian ( @xmath18 ) to non - brownian ( @xmath19 ) behavior with increasing shear rate ; however , such a clear crossover has not yet been reported .",
    "this crossover has not yet been successfully predicted by previous numerical @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies where a dispersed chain is treated as an end - to - end vector , namely , as an infinitely thin line .",
