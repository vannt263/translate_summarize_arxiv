    "<S> we apply a method recently devised by one of the authors to obtain precise analytical formulas for the spectrum of quartic and sextic anharmonic potential . due to </S>",
    "<S> its general features the method can be applied with minimal effort to a wide class of quantum potentials thus allowing very promising applications .    </S>",
    "<S> recently one of the authors has developed a method which allows to obtain analytical approximations to a certain class of integrals with arbitrary precision  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been proven that the expansion proposed in @xcite converges uniformly and that it yields excellent results already to first order . </S>",
    "<S> such method has been applied to a large class of problems in classical mechanics and general relativity , allowing to obtain simple analytical formulas which work even in the non - perturbative regime .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we deal with a further application of the method , showing that it is possible to obtain accurate _ analytical _ expressions for the spectrum of a quantum potential by using it in conjunction of the wkb expansion . </S>",
    "<S> although our calculations are obtained for the anharmonic potential , the procedure that we suggest applies with minor changes to any potential .    </S>",
    "<S> we will use @xcite as our main reference : in that paper bender and collaborators show how to solve the one - dimensional eigenvalue problem for analytic potential to all orders in the wkb approximation . </S>",
    "<S> they obtain a recursion relation for the wkb corrections and they are able to sum the wkb series in two special cases , recovering the exact energy eigenvalues .    however , in the general case of a potential @xmath0 the calculation of the wkb correction to a given order can be difficult and , depending on the potential itself , it is possible that no analytical expression can be found for the wkb integrals . by applying the method of @xcite to the anharmonic oscillator to order @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> we show that one can obtain a precise _ analytical _ approximation to the _ entire spectrum _ of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of the approximation depends both on the order to which the wkb expansion is considered and on the order to which our method is applied .    </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly review the method by considering the integral @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 are the classical turning points of the potential @xmath0 and @xmath4 is the energy . in the spirit of the linear delta expansion  @xcite we interpolate the potential @xmath0 as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a potential introduced by hand , which depends on one or more arbitrary parameters these parameters . ] . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath7 reduces to the full potential for @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we want to perform an expansion described by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn1 ] ) without moving the inversion points ; for this reason we ask that @xmath3 be the inversion points also of the potential @xmath6 . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the energy @xmath9 that the particle would possess if it was moving only in the potential @xmath6 will be given by : @xmath10    we therefore write the integral as @xmath11^{1/2 } \\ dx\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12    we treat the term proportional to @xmath13 as a perturbation and perform an expansion in @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> such expansion will converge uniformly when @xmath14 in the region @xmath15  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this condition selects a particular region in the parameter space , i.e. @xmath16 ; however , maximal convergence is achieved when the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms )  @xcite is used , i.e. when the condition @xmath17 is enforced . </S>",
    "<S> notice that if the potential @xmath6 is chosen appropriately it will be possible to calculate analytically each term in the expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> we now come explicitly to the wkb integrals . </S>",
    "<S> we perform our analysis to order @xmath1 and use the recursion formulas of @xcite to calculate the spectrum of the anharmonic oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite we write the integral in a fashion where the singularities in the integrand are integrable . </S>",
    "<S> the price that we pay is that we have to introduce derivatives with respect to the energy .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore write the wkb condition as @xmath18 where @xmath19 to order @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 we have defined : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the classical turning points . the spectrum of the potential @xmath0 can be obtained by solving eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> so far we have used general formulas ; let us consider now the specific case of the anharmonic oscillator @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the interpolating potential @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the method of @xcite allows to calculate the integrals in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn3 ] ) quite simply . indeed to order @xmath26 and using the value of @xmath16 obtained by the pms to first order one obtains : @xmath27 where we have introduced the variable @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the classical turning points . </S>",
    "<S> the coefficients @xmath30 are pure numbers , which we will not display here .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we plot the error defined as @xmath31 as a function of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the relation between the amplitude and the energy , i.e. @xmath32 , to express @xmath33 as a function of the energy : @xmath34 \\ . </S>",

    "<S> we have assumed the values @xmath36 .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the error is smaller at lower energies and flattens around values of the order of @xmath37 at large energies . </S>",
    "<S> such result can be further improved by applying our method to higher orders in @xmath13 : indeed it was proved in @xcite that the method is convergent and therefore the precision of the calculation can be easily improved . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the behavior of this error is somewhat complementary to the one expected for the wkb expansion , which is known to work better for the highly excited states . </S>",
    "<S> this is of course a nice feature , which allows to obtain a higher precision in our calculations .     for @xmath36 as a function of the energy.,width=340 ]    </S>",
    "<S> once eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn4a ] ) , ( [ eqn4b ] ) and ( [ eqn4c ] ) are substituted back in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn3 ] ) one obtains a rather complicated expression , which still needs to be inverted in order to give the energy as a function of the quantum number @xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> . however this task is easily accomplished by taylor expanding eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn3 ] ) around @xmath39 ( which corresponds to the higher part of the spectrum ) and by then using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn5 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the approximate _ analytical _ formula for the spectrum of the quartic anharmonic oscillator : @xmath40 where the first few coefficients @xmath41 are given by @xmath42    notice that altough the coefficients @xmath41 of higher order could be calculated as well , it is not necessary to do so , since they would only provide corrections that would be dominated by the error that we are making evaluating the integrals @xmath43 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we plot the energy eigenvalues of the last column of table iii of @xcite , corresponding to @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 and compare them with the approximate results obtained by using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn6 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that our formula , although quite simple , works excellently .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we display the error over the energy defined as @xmath48 as a function of the quantum number @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the boxes have been obtained using our formula eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn6 ] ) and assuming @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 are the energies of the anharmonic oscillator calculated with high precision in last column of table iii of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the jump corresponding to @xmath50 is due to the low precision of the last value of table iii of @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> ( 1.34 ) of @xcite ( triangles ) and assuming @xmath51 and @xmath52 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 are the energies of the anharmonic oscillator numerically calculated through a fortran code . </S>",
    "<S> we can easily appreciate that our formula provides an approximation which is several order of magnitude better than the one of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1.34 ) of @xcite .    as a further check on the soundness of our approximation we consider the quantum zeta function for the quartic anharmonic oscillator  @xcite : @xmath53    the exact value of @xmath54 corresponding to setting @xmath55 and @xmath56 </S>",
    "<S> is known to be @xmath57    we have estimated @xmath54 by using the first few numerical eigenvalues and then using for the remaining ones the analytical formula corresponding to the solution of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> we assume @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47.,width=340 ]    , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( set 1 ) and with @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( set 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the boxes and the pluses have been obtained with our method , the triangles correspond to the error calculated using the analytical formula of @xcite.,width=340 ]    we have also applied our method to the case of a anharmonic potential of the form @xmath61 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we have used the wkb expansion to leading order and we have approximated with our method the integral @xmath62 corresponding to this potential . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] we display the error @xmath63 as a function of the energy . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 is the exact value of the integral calculated numerically , whereas @xmath65 is the analytical approximant obtained with our method to order @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> although the error increases with the energy , we notice that it is always smaller than @xmath67 . as in the case of the quartic oscillator </S>",
    "<S> , our approximation works better in the region of low energy , i.e. opposite to the wkb method .    by using the approximation for the integral @xmath62 obtained with our method we have derived a very simple formula for the spectrum of the sextic oscillator to leading order in the wkb expansion : @xmath68 where @xmath69    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] we compare the lower part of the spectrum obtained using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn7 ] ) with the exact eigenvalues , obtained numerically with a fortran code . </S>",
    "<S> once again the agreement between the two is impressive . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig6 ] ) displays the error ( in @xmath70 ) over the energy obtained using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn7 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the error is of the order of a few percents for low values of @xmath38 , but drops quite quickly , reaching a plateau of about @xmath67 at large @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the plateau is a consequence of the error that we are making in the evaluation of @xmath71 , as already discussed when we considered fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . since the method that we are using is convergent@xcite , by working to higher orders one can arbitrarily lower the position of such plateau , to obtain the highly excited part of the energy spectrum with the desired accuracy .     for @xmath72.,width=340 ]    ) . </S>",

    "<S> we are able to estimate _ analytically _ the wkb integrals with high precision , given the convergent nature of the expansion that we are performing . </S>",
