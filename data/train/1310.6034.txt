    "measuring the couplings of the recently discovered higgs boson  @xcite to the standard model fermions is a critical part of the investigation of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the standard model coupling to the top quark is expected to be of order unity , making it a prime target for studying the effects of many different new physics models in and beyond the higgs sector  @xcite .",
    "together with the higgs self coupling it dominates the extrapolation of weak  scale higgs physics to more fundamental energy scales  @xcite . measuring this parameter",
    "will uniquely probe extensions of the higgs sector at the weak scale  @xcite as well as at high scales .",
    "however , with a production cross section of only @xmath0 at the 13  tev lhc , measurements based on the @xmath1 channel are extremely difficult .",
    "search strategies in the fully leptonic and semi - leptonic decay channels for the top have been suggested in combination with higgs decays to @xmath2  @xcite , @xmath3  @xcite , and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "these are challenging through a combination of combinatoric backgrounds , missing control regions , large qcd uncertainties on the backgrounds , and low rate .",
    "typical luminosities required for a @xmath5 signal might well be in the 100  fb@xmath6 range for 13  tev collider energy , with a signal  to  background ratio well below 1:1 .    in this paper we provide a feasibility study for the fully hadronic channel of @xmath1 production , _",
    "i.e. _  a final state consisting of four @xmath7-jets plus up to four un - tagged jets .",
    "this channel has not been studied yet .",
    "in fact , there exist only a few analyses targeting higgs or new physics searches in purely hadronic channels without missing energy or leptons , most notably some recent top pair resonance  @xcite and sgluon searches  @xcite .",
    "however , the fully hadronic decay channel of @xmath1 has two possible advantages over the leptonic decay modes .",
    "first , hadronic decays of both the tops and the higgs have the highest branching ratios of any decay mode .",
    "second , without neutrinos and their missing momenta , a full reconstruction of the @xmath1 final state is possible , which allows for discrimination of signal and background and provides the best testing ground in the presence of possible experimental anomalies .",
    "in addition , this eight  parton final state has the highest jet multiplicity of any widely - considered standard model process at the lhc .",
    "demonstrating our ability to understand and use such events is an important benchmark in our study of standard model physics at the lhc .",
    "we separate the signal events from the large qcd background via a two - step process . for four @xmath7-jet events ,",
    "we first apply global acceptance cuts , giving us an enriched sample of signal events .",
    "we then reconstruct the tops using the `` bucket algorithm ''  @xcite , which closes the gap between kinematic top reconstruction at threshold and proper top taggers  @xcite by targeting slightly boosted top quarks , with @xmath8 the algorithm identifies the two top quarks in the event by permuting over jet assignments to three buckets , minimizing a distance metric on two of those buckets between the invariant mass of the jets in the buckets and the mass of the top .",
    "the remaining event contains two @xmath7-jets , which allow us to reconstruct the higgs decay with a probability above 60% .",
    "it should be noted that the results in this paper deliberately only rely on a simple cut  and  count method .",
    "it allows us to identify many opportunities for data  driven side band calibration of the backgrounds , which is crucial to such high  multiplicity searches .",
    "as the top - reconstruction technique provides a good approximation of the momenta of all the particles in the original event , more sophisticated techniques can be used to improve rejection of background and signal selection .    in the next section",
    ", we study the major backgrounds to the @xmath1 search , including some global background rejection cuts .",
    "the bucket algorithm is introduced in section  [ sec : buckets ] , where we also give a detailed estimate of the analysis performance . a detailed discussion of the qcd backgrounds and their simulation are included in appendix  [ app : qcd ] .",
    "finally , in appendix  [ app : recon ] we show the metrics for the top reconstruction .",
    "our analysis aims to extract the fully hadronic final state of @xmath1 production with the decay @xmath9 . for a higgs mass of 125  gev",
    "we assume the standard model branching ratio to the @xmath2 final state of 57.7%  @xcite . we will require four @xmath7-tagged jets in the final state , no leptons , and at least two un - tagged hard jets .",
    "we assume jet - based triggers for hard multi - jet events , similar to all ",
    "hadronic @xmath10 searches  @xcite .",
    "the main four-@xmath7 backgrounds , ordered by relevance , are @xmath11 the corresponding fake-@xmath7 channels are strongly suppressed if the experiments reach a 70% @xmath7-tagging efficiency with 1% mis - tagging probability for light - flavor and gluon jets .",
    "we estimate the rate of the mis - tagged @xmath12multi - jet background to be contribute to the actual @xmath13 rate at the 10% level , below the quoted uncertainties in the simulations of the primary background .",
    "similarly , we can ignore the pure qcd events with four mis - tags .    for our event simulation",
    "we rely on alpgen  @xcite and madgraph  @xcite , both with a pythia parton shower  @xcite , as well as on sherpa  @xcite . for the @xmath1 signal our main event sample includes zero and one hard extra jet merged in the ckkw scheme  @xcite in sherpa . in appendix",
    "[ app : qcd ] we compare the sherpa results with the madgraph simulation of @xmath1 plus up to one hard jet merged in the mlm scheme  @xcite .",
    "we confirm that the sensitivity to simulation and qcd issues is minimal .",
    "similarly , for the @xmath14 background , our main sample of events is produced by sherpa and includes up to one hard qcd jet .",
    "a comparison with alpgen samples in appendix  [ app : qcd ] again shows negligible dependence on the simulation techniques .",
    "we normalize the merged event samples to the nlo results of 504  fb for the signal  @xcite and 1037  fb after generator cuts for the @xmath14 background  @xcite . the @xmath15 background from alpgen",
    "is small compared to the primary @xmath14 and @xmath13 backgrounds , with a cross section of at maximum 5% of the signal . as a result",
    ", it does not require an extensive study of the theoretical and simulation uncertainties , and will not be considered in detail .",
    "the critical background for the hadronic @xmath1 signal with @xmath16 decays is the qcd process @xmath17jets . before any selection cuts",
    ", its total rate completely overwhelms the signal , with a cross section of 400  pb estimated by alpgen after pre - selection cuts .",
    "however , as any qcd process it is dominated by soft @xmath7 and un - tagged jets with an additional enhancement from the gluon splitting @xmath18 . to extract our signal we will require four hard , well separated @xmath7-tagged jets .",
    "we simulate these background events both in alpgen and sherpa with a hard process of ( at least ) four @xmath7-jets .",
    "as we will see in section  [ sec : buckets ] , our bucket reconstruction of two tops and the higgs will require at least two additional hard un - tagged jets .",
    "therefore , our central background simulation is defined by the hard process @xmath19 plus parton shower in alpgen , which results in a cross section of 2128  fb after pre - selection cuts . to ensure that our analysis is stable with respect to qcd uncertainties",
    ", we also simulate the background with sherpa as @xmath13 plus zero and one matrix element jet merged ( @xmath13 + 0/1j ) .",
    "the computational expense of two jet merging is prohibitive here , and so is not included .",
    "however , to have a measure for the underlying theory uncertainties , we vary the renormalization and factorization scales in the sherpa simulation by a factor 1/2 to 2 around the central scale , to ensure that our conclusions hold independent of these choices .",
    "we carefully compare our two background estimates in appendix  [ app : qcd ] , providing detailed information on kinematic distributions and the different simulation tools and hard processes .",
    "there , we test a couple of important assumptions underlying our analysis .",
    "first , we demonstrate that the bucket analysis allows only background events with at least two hard un - tagged jets in our signal region . for this region",
    "the alpgen estimate of the @xmath19 rate is the appropriate and conservative choice .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate that our analysis is not too sensitive to describing the second un - tagged jet by either the hard matrix element ( as in the alpgen ) or by the parton shower ( as in sherpa ) .",
    "finally , the full merged @xmath13+jets simulation would allow access to excellent control regions in the side band of the number of un - tagged jets , once these kinds of @xmath20 distributions are systematically evaluated by atlas and cms  @xcite .",
    "understanding the kinematics of the @xmath13 background and reducing it using global kinematic cuts will be the central topic of this section . in the next section",
    ", we will find that several of these kinematic cuts can be replaced with the requirement of top reconstruction , which allows for an increased purity of signal over background . in the actual buckets analysis in section  [ sec : buckets ] , we only quote the alpgen results for the @xmath13 background .    compared to the signal rate , the raw qcd background ( primarily @xmath17jets )",
    "is overwhelmingly large , and so we must apply selection cuts before the top - finding bucket algorithm can be employed .",
    "first , we require all events to have four @xmath7-tagged jets .",
    "these @xmath7-jets must be central and widely separated , to avoid the phase space regions with enhanced @xmath18 splitting , with @xmath21 in addition , we require at least two hard non-@xmath7 jets with @xmath22 these naive acceptance cuts are very inefficient , for example when compared to sub - jet methods . however , the aim of this paper is to show that the purely hadronic @xmath1 process can be studied at the lhc , so we need to ensure that the pure qcd backgrounds can be reliably removed .",
    "moreover , four individual @xmath7-tags can not be treated as statistically independent unless we at least assume very widely separated @xmath7-jets .",
    "this necessitates the harsh cuts in this proof  of  concept analysis .",

    "the @xmath15 contribution is sub - percent level , and so not shown . at this stage",
    "the @xmath13+jets cross section is still significantly larger than the signal , so an additional set of cuts is required .",
    "once we introduce the top reconstruction technique , such cuts are not necessary , but it will be instructive to compare our later results to simple global cuts .",
    "we consider two global variables : the effective mass calculated by summing the scalar jet @xmath26 over all jets , including those with @xmath7-tags , and its counterpart where the sum runs only over the four @xmath7-tagged jets , @xmath27 both of these observables will be sensitive to the kinematics of the multi - jet system . in figure",
    "[ fig : global ] we show the distributions for both signal and backgrounds , normalized to the event rates after the cuts of eqs . and  . at this point , the signal  to  background ratio is around 1:50 . as we will discuss in appendix",
    "[ app : qcd ] , the fact that the @xmath28 distributions of the signal and the @xmath13 backgrounds show a similar behavior is because our alpgen simulation requires two hard un - tagged jets .",
    "in other words , the background simulation shown in figure  [ fig : global ] anticipates the fact that we will only be interested in a reliable prediction of those background events which are kinematically similar to the signal .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : global ] shows that after requiring @xmath29  gev both @xmath28 and @xmath30 have similar shapes for signal and background .",
    "it is more efficient to consider the 2-dimensional plane of the two effective mass variables defined in eq .. in figure  [ fig : meff_bratio_2d ] , we plot these distributions for the signal and the ratios of signal  to  background against the primary ( @xmath17jets ) for both alpgen and sherpa simulations . as can be seen , the sherpa simulation has many fewer events in the high @xmath28 tail compared to the alpgen simulation , as expected due to the acceptance cut .",
    "the sherpa simulation only generates up to one light - flavor or gluon jet from the hard matrix element , but the acceptance cuts require at least two hard un - tagged jets per event .",
    "as argued in appendix  [ app : qcd ] we use the @xmath17jets sample from alpgen for a more conservative background estimate . in this proof  of  concept paper , we make the crude requirements that @xmath31 this set of cuts brings the background rate to a manageable level , without a detailed analysis of the top and higgs kinematics . for the specific @xmath19 background modeling with alpgen",
    "we arrive at @xmath32 , as quoted in table  [ tab : global ] .    from this point on",
    ", we are interested in identifying an excess of events that contain two @xmath7-jets which are clearly identified with the higgs boson decay .",
    "this is complicated by the combinatorial background of picking the correct two @xmath7-jets out of the four in the event .",
    "first , we consider naive set of selection criteria for the two @xmath7-jets which have to lie in the higgs mass window in table  [ tab : global ] . we show that selecting the two @xmath7-jets closest in mass to @xmath33  gev , the two @xmath7-jets with the softest @xmath26 , the two hardest , and the two @xmath7-jets with the minimum invariant mass are all methods that fail to sufficiently increase signal over background .",
    "clearly , a better solution to the reconstruction of the top and higgs decay products and the combinatorics associated with this assignment is needed .",
    "we therefore turn to the bucket reconstruction  @xcite to rebuild the two top quarks in the event , using those events that have passed our initial selection criteria described by eqs . and .",
    "this tags the two @xmath7-jets that come from the tops with a good degree of accuracy , identifying the higgs decay products by exclusion . with this method of identifying the correct @xmath7-jets , the global cuts on @xmath28 variables",
    "do not improve the @xmath24 ratio , and so we do not continue to apply the cuts of eq .. this simple algorithm is not meant to replace a full experimental likelihood analysis , but it shows that after simple kinematic cuts a purely hadronic @xmath1 analysis can be a realistic possibility .",
    "following the arguments in the last section and the corresponding appendix  [ app : qcd ] it should be possible to devise an analysis of the hadronic top and higgs kinematics to reduce the backgrounds to a manageable level . aside from the irreducible @xmath14 background we need to extract the signal from the huge multi - jet @xmath13 background .",
    "a more specific analysis of the multi - jet final state should be able to do better than the already promising global effective mass cuts in eq .. the key concern will be the signal efficiency , because of the limited @xmath1 rate .",
    "for this reason , we choose the bucket reconstruction  @xcite , which allows us to keep a larger fraction of signal events while removing significant parts of the background phase space identified by the global cuts analysis .",
    "the technical challenge is tracking the definition of the signal region and the corresponding background simulation .",
    "after applying the jet - level selection cuts in the previous section , eqs . and",
    ", we have a sample of events with four @xmath7-jets and additional extra jets . of these four @xmath7-jets ,",
    "two are presumed to come from the higgs decay , and two from top decays . without knowledge of the top",
    "decays , various higgs reconstruction schemes could be tried . as discussed in the previous section",
    ", one could take the two @xmath7-jets with the highest or lowest @xmath26 , the combination of @xmath7-jets with invariant mass that is closest to 125  gev , the combination with the minimum invariant mass , or some other set based on simple jet kinematics .",
    "taking the combination with the invariant mass closest to that of the higgs in particular runs into a combinatorial problem : in both signal and background , one can often find two @xmath7-jets with invariant mass near that of the higgs without the jets involved having originated with the higgs .",
    "this shapes the background to look like signal .",
    "the multi-@xmath7 combinatorics are the reason that the atlas @xmath1 search in the early phase of lhc running was largely abandoned  @xcite .",
    "we can improve this situation if we find a better way to identify the @xmath7-jets that come from the higgs .",
    "we approach this problem by first identifying the decay products of the tops , using the top bucket algorithm .",
    "the idea behind this algorithm is very simple and straightforward : we divide all jets in every event into three buckets .",
    "two of the buckets correspond to the hadronic tops , while the third bucket consists of all jets in the event that can not be associated with a top . in the original formulation of the algorithm  @xcite",
    "this last bucket was identified with initial state radiation ( isr ) . in the current analysis ,",
    "this isr bucket will contain two @xmath7-jets , which can  by exclusion  be identified as the decay products of the higgs .",
    "we start by seeding each of the two top buckets with a @xmath7-jet .",
    "we permute over all possible assignments of @xmath7-jets as top bucket seeds .",
    "we then cycle through every possible assignment of non-@xmath7-tagged jets to the three buckets , requiring at least one non - tagged jet in each of the top buckets .",
    "we use the distance metric @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the top mass and the sum runs over all jets ( including the @xmath7-jet ) in the bucket @xmath36 .",
    "we select the jet assignment that minimizes the distance measure @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a factor chosen to stabilize the jet grouping . for this analysis , we choose @xmath39 , which essentially decouples the second bucket from the metric .",
    "thus , bucket @xmath40 is the bucket with invariant mass closest to the top . after this construction",
    ", we have two buckets @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with two or three jets , including the seed @xmath7-jet .",
    "rarely , we find a bucket containing four or more jets , in which case we merge to three jets using the cambridge / aachen algorithm  @xcite .    to remove background events that do not contain real tops , we require the invariant masses of the two top buckets to lie in the window @xmath42 next , we require both @xmath40 and @xmath41 buckets to contain a hadronically decaying @xmath43 boson candidate .",
    "we define a mass ratio cut , as in the heptoptagger  @xcite , @xmath44 for at least one combination of the non-@xmath7-jets ( denoted @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) in the bucket @xmath47 .",
    "buckets with only one @xmath7-tagged and one non - tagged jet by construction can not satisfy eq .. we can therefore classify events in one of three categories :    * ( @xmath48,@xmath48 ) : both top buckets have @xmath43 candidates as defined by eq .",
    ", * ( @xmath48,@xmath49 ) or ( @xmath49,@xmath48 ) : only the first or second top bucket has a @xmath43 candidate , * ( @xmath49,@xmath49 ) : neither top bucket has a @xmath43 candidate .",
    "the @xmath48 or @xmath49 status is ordered as @xmath50 , where again , @xmath40 is defined as the bucket closest in mass to the top .",
    "buckets classified as @xmath48 have to include at least three jets , while @xmath49 buckets can include either three or two jets .    for buckets that fail the criteria of eq . , we can still attempt to reconstruct a top by replacing eq . with an alternative distance metric , @xmath51 we re - assign all @xmath7-tagged and un - tagged jets in the @xmath49  bucket(s ) , combined with the jets in the isr bucket to new buckets , irrespective of their original categorization .",
    "for this re - assignment we minimize @xmath52 . for a top candidate ,",
    "we require at least one @xmath7/jet pair satisfying @xmath53 this revamped metric is intended to capture top events where the less energetic jet from @xmath43 decay was lost in the detector .",

    "@xcite to reconstruct the hadronic tops . using this reconstruction technique",
    "nets us several useful advantages over more naive methods to reduce the very large backgrounds .",
    "first , by having an accurate method of determining which two of the four @xmath7-jets in the event should be assigned to the top pair , we can cut through the combinatorial problem of identifying the two @xmath7-jets from the higgs decay .",
    "side bands with @xmath68  gev or @xmath69  gev can be used to determine the background shape and extract the background cross section after cuts .",
    "second , the bucket algorithm not only identifies the @xmath7-jets from the top decay , it also gives a good approximation of the top and higgs momenta .",
    "this allows us to place additional cuts , for example on the transverse momenta of the top quarks or on the @xmath66 of the various parton ",
    "level objects .",
    "both of them help to reject background .",
    "in particular , requiring a small boost of the top quarks eases the combinatorial problem  @xcite .",
    "further , more detailed analyses may improve on the fairly crude cuts we have chosen in this proof  of  concept paper .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrated on demonstrating the stability of our reconstruction technique despite the potentially large simulation and theoretical uncertainties inherent to a qcd background consisting of four @xmath7-jets with many extra un - tagged jets .",
    "using both alpgen and sherpa , we have validated that the simulation issues are under control . however",
    ", our study also clearly shows that the theory uncertainties on this kind of backgrounds are hardly covered by a factor two on the rate prediction .",
    "these issues can be mitigated in the experiments by use of the ample side - bands that this analysis affords .",

    "in this appendix we will confirm that the analysis described in this paper does not critically depend on uncertainties in the way we compute our signal and backgrounds .",
    "for the signal and the @xmath14 background we primarily rely on sherpa  @xcite predictions with up to one additional hard jet merged using the ckkw approach  @xcite . for the @xmath1 signal",
    "we test our results using madgraph  @xcite , with up to one hard jet included in the mlm scheme  @xcite .",
    "both event samples are normalized to the next - to - leading order rate ( extrapolated to 13 tev ) of 504  fb  @xcite , times a higgs branching ratio of 57.7% .",
    "this corresponds to 129  fb for the purely hadronic decay channel . in table",
    "[ tab : app_signal ] we observe a small difference in the normalization of the two event samples .",
    "the reason is that as a cross check in the madgraph simulation , we do not require hadronic top decays in the simulation . as a result ,",

    "our default sherpa simulation conservatively does not include these events .    for the @xmath14 background we test the sherpa simulation with up to one hard additional jet with an alpgen  @xcite simulation without additional hard jets .",
    "again , both samples are normalized to the next - to - leading order rate of 1037  fb  @xcite after the generator cuts @xmath70  gev , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "this rate is approximate because , in the absence of a next - to - leading order prediction for @xmath73  tev , we are forced to first extract the @xmath74 factor for 14  tev and the cuts of ref .",
    "@xcite , including a regularizing cut on the invariant mass of the two bottom quarks .",
    "we then multiply our cross section at 13  tev by this @xmath74 factor .",
    "this approach is not ideal , but better then just using the leading order prediction .    in table",
    "[ tab : app_signal ] we see that the transverse momentum distributions for the `` reconstructed '' top quarks ( which , for @xmath13 , do not correspond to any parton - level tops ) from alpgen are softer than for sherpa .",
    "this effect comes from the generically harder jets of ckkw merging , compared to those from the parton shower . in order to be conservative , we use the merged sherpa results for our analysis . on the other hand ,",
    "the difference of less than 20% is well within the theory uncertainties for this background .    as argued in section  [ sec : multijets ] , the most dangerous background events should be correctly described by our alpgen simulation of the @xmath19 background plus pythia parton shower , as the required extra jets must be hard , and therefore well - modeled by the matrix - level process . with our merged sherpa simulation of @xmath75  jet ,",
    "we test several aspects of our main background simulation :    1 .",
    "we check if the events with two additional hard jets are indeed the leading background after the kind of global cuts proposed in section  [ sec : multijets ] .",
    "this aspect is very important for the appropriate simulation of the qcd background in an actual analysis .",
    "we test if our analysis depends on the simulation of the second un - tagged jet either with the hard matrix element or through the parton shower . in this way we can estimate an important source of theory uncertainties .",
    "3 .   as a measure of the level of agreement between the two simulations we compute the merged sherpa event rate with a consistent variation of the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "ideally , the two simulations should agree within this scale variation in the signal region of the buckets analysis . because the merged sherpa prediction includes some leading next - to - leading order contribution",
    "such a numerical agreement also indicates that our @xmath19 simulations should not be plagued by huge qcd corrections .",
    "this extensive list of tests should give a clear answer to the question if purely hadronic @xmath1 searches can be done in the presence of the large qcd backgrounds .",
    "finally , we point out that merged sherpa simulations can define excellent side bands in the @xmath76 distribution  @xcite , which together with side bands in @xmath62 should be sufficient to control the background rate in the signal region in an experimental analysis .",
    "our results suggest that such an approach would require a merged simulation of @xmath13 with up to at least two hard light - flavor or gluon jets , which is beyond our cpu capabilities .",
