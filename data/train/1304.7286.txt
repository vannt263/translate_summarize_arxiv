    "these galaxies are all starbursts , and the majority of them are quasar hosts .",
    "this rising trend can be understood if the median gas density in the luminous high - redshift galaxies is higher than in the nearby systems , and approaches or exceeds the critical density of the hcn(@xmath0=1@xmath10 ) transition . in this case , hcn no longer traces just the dense , star - forming cores ( which have similar @xmath36/@xmath37 ratios ) , but rather traces the bulk of the molecular gas , in a similar fashion as co does in galaxies with lower , more typical gas densities ( krumholz & thompson 2007 ) .",
    "this picture is supported by the finding that @xmath37/@xmath35 , on average , appears to increase with @xmath36 for nearby galaxies , but does not further increase between nearby ultra - luminous infrared galaxies and the more far - infrared - luminous high - redshift systems ( riechers et al .",
    "more detailed studies of dense gas excitation in distant galaxies and an extension to multiple dense gas tracers , as possible with the jvla and alma , will be crucial to further investigate this issue .     and",

    "some of the most far - infrared - luminous high - redshift galaxies lie above the scatter in @xmath36/@xmath37 of the most luminous nearby starbursts ( panel * b * ; riechers et al .",
    "due to the completion of powerful new observatories such as the jvla and alma , progress in the field of high - redshift molecular line studies in the coming years will be multifold . beyond a rapid increase in the number of galaxies detected in co emission ( e.g. , riechers et al . , in prep . ;",

    "another key aspect will be to study the gas content of distant galaxies not exclusively based on co observations of individual , specifically selected samples , but also in a more unbiased fashion .",
    "this will provide direct constraints on the co luminosity function of galaxies at high redshift , and thus , the `` cold gas history of the universe '' ( i.e. , the gas mass per unit cosmic volume as a function of redshift ) .",
    "such investigations require observations of molecular deep fields , i.e. , `` blind '' co redshift scans over substantial cosmic volumes . using the full capabilities of the recently completed jvla correlator , the first such studies are currently underway , and will provide unique new constraints on the evolution of galaxies through cosmic times .",
