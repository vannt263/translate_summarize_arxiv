    "it has recently been found that supermassive blackholes ( smbh ) with masses of m@xmath3 @xmath4 10@xmath5m@xmath6 are ubiquitously present at the centers of spheroidal components ( bulges and elliptical galaxies ) @xcite .",
    "when active mass accretion onto a smbh occurs , it is observed as an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the current agn picture postulates that dust is present in torus geometry around the central smbh @xcite .",
    "the direction perpendicular to the torus is mostly transparent to the bulk of the agn s ionizing uv  soft x - ray photons .",
    "gas clouds at 101000 pc distances from the agn along the torus axis , photo - ionized by the central agn s radiation , produce the so - called narrow - line regions ( nlrs ; robson 1996 ) .",
    "since the spectral shapes of the ionizing photons differ between agns and stars , emission - line ratios from nlrs differ from gas clouds photo - ionized in star - forming galaxies .",
    "thus , agns surrounded by torus - shaped dust with well developed nlrs are distinguishable from star - forming galaxies relatively easily @xcite .",
    "because dust at the central @xmath710 pc of galaxies has an angular momentum , the spatial distribution of the dust is likely to be axisymmetrical ; dust column density is higher in one direction ( the torus direction ) and lower in another direction ( the torus axis ) .",
    "when the nuclear concentration of dust becomes large , even the torus axis direction can be opaque to the bulk of the agn s uv  soft x - ray radiation , and the radiation can be blocked at the inner part ( @xmath710 pc ) , producing virtually no nlrs .",
    "such _ buried _ agns are no longer detectable as long as emission lines originating in the nlrs are sought . because a simple interpretation of the cosmic x - ray background spectrum suggests that most agns in the universe are buried @xcite , it is important to establish a technique for finding buried agns . in a buried agn , almost all of the energetic uv",
    " soft x - ray radiation is absorbed by the surrounding dust and is re - emitted as infrared dust emission .",
    "for this reason , _ luminous _ buried agns are expected to be strong infrared emitters .",
    "luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) , which radiate strong infrared emission with l@xmath8 @xmath4 10@xmath9l@xmath6 and contain highly concentrated nuclear dust @xcite , are probable objects in which luminous buried agns reside .",
    "since star - forming activity can also produce infrared emission , it is necessary to distinguish the origin of the infrared luminosities of lirgs if we are to study the luminous buried agn population .",
    "an effective method is to search for the presence of strong x - ray emission because an agn intrinsically produces much stronger x - ray emission compared to star - forming activity @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , buried agns generally contain a large amount of nuclear dust @xcite , and most of them may be compton - thick ( n@xmath10 @xmath4 10@xmath11 @xmath12 ) sources @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations at e @xmath4 10 kev are needed to directly detect compton - thick x - ray emission from luminous buried agns with a small scattered / reflected component @xcite ; however , these are applicable only to a few very nearby bright lirgs due to a current sensitivity limit .",
    "although a systematic buried agn search through direct x - ray observations is difficult , we can investigate the presence of a luminous buried agn through the chemical effects of the intrinsically strong x - ray emission on the surrounding interstellar medium . around a strongly x - ray - emitting buried agn surrounded by dense gas and dust , the so - called x - ray dissociation regions ( xdr ; maloney et al .",
    "1996 ) should develop , in contrast to photo - dissociation regions ( pdrs ) usually seen in strongly uv - emitting star - forming regions .",
    "detection of xdr signatures can thus be a useful tool for locating a luminous buried agn .",
    "among the several proposed probes of xdrs @xcite , we focus on the _ observationally derived _ method based on hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) line ratios @xcite , because theoretical prediction of line fluxes from pdrs and xdrs requires many free parameters @xcite and could still be uncertain , given that the most important parameter",
    " detailed properties of the clumpy structure of molecular gas @xcite  is totally unknown from observations .    here ,",
    "we present the results of our millimeter interferometric hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) observations using the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) of nearby lirgs whose energy sources have previously been investigated at other wavelengths .",
    "compared to previous hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) observations of lirgs using single - dish radio telescopes @xcite , our interferometric maps have the important advantage that spatially resolved hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) data are obtainable in lirgs , which often show disturbed , multiple nuclei morphologies @xcite .",
    "new ground - based infrared @xmath1-band ( 2.84.1 @xmath2 m ) spectra of higher quality than older data were also taken for individual main nuclei of these millimeter - observed lirgs to better constrain the nature of their obscured energy sources .",
    "we adopted h@xmath13 @xmath14 75 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 = 0.3 , and @xmath17 = 0.7 throughout this paper .",
    "the target lirgs are selected on the basis of their proximity ( @xmath18 0.06 ) to cover the redshifted hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) emission lines with the nma receiving systems , and their expected high fluxes of hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) .",

    "the presence of starburst activity (= active star - formation ) is evident in various observational data @xcite , but the detected starburst is energetically insufficient to fully account for the observed infrared luminosity of arp 220 quantitatively @xcite , requiring the energy source deeply buried in arp 220 s nuclear core @xcite .",

    "for example , arp 220 and vv 114e have double nuclei with separations of 1 to 1.5 arcsec , which can be resolved only with the ground - based spectra . for mrk 231 and iras 08572 + 3915",
    ", although infrared @xmath1-band spectra taken with @xmath74 m telescopes have been published @xcite , a higher - quality @xmath1-band spectrum obtained with a larger , 8-m - class telescope may be able to provide new constraints on their energy sources .",
    "we thus obtained infrared @xmath1-band spectra of arp 220 , mrk 231 , iras 08572 + 3915 , and vv 114e using the subaru 8.2-m telescope @xcite atop mauna kea , hawaii .",

    "the precipitable water was low , 12 mm for the 2006 july observing run , and @xmath71 mm for the 2007 january run .",
    "we employed a standard telescope nodding technique ( abba pattern ) with a throw of 5 to 7 arcsec along the slit to subtract background emission .",
    "we used the optical guider of the subaru telescope to monitor the telescope tracking .",
    "exposure time was 1.01.5 sec , and 3060 coadds were made at each nod position .    for both observing runs , f- or g - type main sequence stars ( table 4 )",
    "were observed as standard stars , with a mean airmass difference of @xmath70.1 to the individual lirg nuclei to correct for the transmission of earth s atmosphere and to provide flux calibration .",
    "the @xmath1-band magnitudes of the standard stars were estimated from their @xmath34-band ( @xmath35 0.6 @xmath2 m ) magnitudes , adopting the @xmath36 colors appropriate to the stellar types of individual standard stars @xcite .",
    "standard data analysis procedures were employed using iraf .",
    "initially , frames taken with an a ( or b ) beam were subtracted from frames subsequently taken with a b ( or a ) beam , and the resulting subtracted frames were added and divided by a spectroscopic flat image .",
    "bad pixels and pixels hit by cosmic rays were then replaced with the interpolated values of the surrounding pixels . finally , the spectra of the lirgs nuclei and standard stars were extracted by integrating signals over 0@xmath2581@xmath258 , depending on the actual signal profiles . to create a combined spectrum of arp 220e+w , we summed signals over 2@xmath2552@xmath259 along the slit .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed based on the wavelength - dependent transmission of earth s atmosphere .",
    "the spectra of the lirgs nuclei were divided by the observed spectra of standard stars and multiplied by the spectra of blackbodies with temperatures appropriate to individual standard stars ( table 4 ) .",
    "flux calibration was performed based on signals of the lirgs and standard stars detected inside our slit spectra . seeing sizes in the @xmath32-band ( and @xmath1-band ) were always smaller than the employed slit widths , and good telescope tracking performance of subaru was established .",
    "we thus expected possible slit loss for the compact ( @xmath70@xmath256 ) emission to be minimal , say @xmath730% .",
    "in fact , we divided the whole data set into subgroups and compared their flux levels , which agreed within 20% for all lirgs . this level of possible flux uncertainty ( @xmath730% ) for the compact emission will not seriously affect our main conclusions . to reduce scatter of the infrared spectra , appropriate binning of spectral elements was performed , particularly at @xmath37 @xmath2 m in the observed frame , where the scatter of data points is larger due to poorer earth atmospheric transmission than at @xmath38 @xmath2 m .",
    "for arp 220 and mrk 231 , millimeter spectra at hcn(10 ) or hco@xmath0(10 ) emission peak positions show that the flux levels between these lines are substantially above the zero level , indicating that continuum emission is clearly present .",
    "we combined data points that are unaffected by these lines and made interferometric maps of the continuum emission .",

    "the small flux is possibly due to the small slit width ( 0@xmath256 ) in the new spectra and/or possible @xmath1-band flux ambiguity in the adopted standard star , hr 5728 ( table 4 ) .",

    "its optical depth is estimated to be @xmath53 @xmath21 0.8 , which is similar to previous estimates @xcite .",
    "the optical depth is larger than the upper limit produced with the natural geometry of a normal starburst ( stellar energy sources and dust spatially well mixed ; @xmath53 @xmath7 0.2 ) , but requires buried agn - type geometry in which the energy source is more centrally concentrated than the dust @xcite , supporting the buried - agn classification as previously indicated from the low ew@xmath49 value ( @xmath73 nm ; table 10 ) .    in the high - quality iras 08572 + 3915nw spectrum in figure 7 ,",
    "the broad absorption feature centered at @xmath52 = 3.2 @xmath2 m or @xmath27 = 3.03.05 @xmath2 m is seen for the first time . in a buried agn and starburst composite galaxy , the buried agn emission is more highly obscured , because the central compact buried agn should be geometrically surrounded by the starburst .",
    "hence , the contribution from buried agn emission to an observed flux becomes higher with increasing wavelength , from the @xmath32-band ( 22.5 @xmath2 m ) to @xmath1-band ( 2.84.1 @xmath2 m ) , due to smaller dust extinction .",
    "additionally , blackbody radiation from stars ( t @xmath4 4000k ) generally shows a steeply decreasing flux from the @xmath32- to @xmath1-band . for these reasons",
    ", it could happen that an observed @xmath32-band continuum emission largely comes from foreground stellar emission , in addition to buried agn emission , while an @xmath1-band continuum , particularly at a longer wavelength part , is dominated by buried agn emission .",
    "if this is the case for iras 08572 + 3915nw and if the stellar emission s tail extends from the k - band to the shorter part of the @xmath1-band ( @xmath52 @xmath7 3.0 @xmath2 m ) , then an absorption - like feature at @xmath27 @xmath21 3.05 @xmath2 m could be reproduced .",
    "however , the @xmath32-band spectrum of iras 08572 + 3915 comes mostly from buried - agn - heated hot dust emission , because of the extremely red @xmath32-band continuum and no stellar co absorption features at @xmath27 @xmath21 2.3 @xmath2 m @xcite .",
    "thus , this scenario seems implausible .",
    "we ascribe the absorption - like feature to the 3.05 @xmath2 m absorption by ice - covered dust grains and estimate its optical depth to be @xmath54 @xmath21 0.3 .",
    "the spectrum of vv 114e also displays the 3.05 @xmath2 m ice - absorption feature with an optical depth of @xmath54 @xmath21 0.5 .",
    "its optical depth is again larger than the threshold explained by the mixed dust / source geometry of a normal starburst ( @xmath54 @xmath7 0.3 ; imanishi & maloney 2003 ) , suggesting the presence of a luminous buried agn , as inferred from the low ew@xmath55 value ( @xmath2120 nm ; table 10 ) .",
    "for the infrared @xmath1-band spectra of the remaining lirg nuclei ( arp 220e , w , mrk 231 , and vv 114e@xmath26 ) , no clear absorption features are recognizable .",
    "the absence of absorption features in mrk 231 ( the low ew@xmath49 object ; table 10 ) implies that the agn is only weakly obscured , while those for arp 220e , w , and vv 114e@xmath26 are explained by the predominant contribution from starburst emission to the observed @xmath1-band fluxes . for arp 220w , the nucleus with luminous buried agn signatures @xcite , we see no explicit agn sign in the infrared @xmath1-band spectrum",
    ". the emission from the putative buried agn may be so highly flux - attenuated that its contribution to an observed @xmath1-band flux must be insignificant , compared to foreground weakly - obscured starburst emission .",

    "previously obtained data points of nearby lirgs @xcite , starbursts , and seyfert galaxies @xcite are also plotted . as stated by @xcite",
    ", we mainly use the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) ratios ( ordinate ) in our discussions for the following reasons .",
    "first , since the hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) lines are observed simultaneously with the same array configuration of nma / rainbow , their beam patterns are virtually identical",
    ". we can thus be confident that the same regions are probed with both lines .",
    "second , both hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) fluxes are measured at the same time with the same receiver and same correlator unit so that the possible _ absolute _ flux calibration uncertainty of interferometric data does not propagate to the uncertainty in the ratio , which is dominated by statistical noise and fitting errors ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "therefore , the derivation of the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio is straightforward .",
    "neither of the first and second arguments hold for the hcn(10)/co(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios in the abscissa of figure 8 , which complicates their interpretation",
    ". lirgs with luminous agn signatures at other wavelengths ( arp 220w , mrk 231 , iras 08572 + 3915 ) tend to show high hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios as seen in agn - dominated galaxies .",
    "the ratio is also high in vv 114e-1 , which is close to the putative agn location at vv 114e , despite a slight positional deviation .",
    "the wolf - rayet galaxy he 210 shows a very low hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio .",
    "some individual examples of the nearby galactic high - mass - star - forming , hii - region cores show high hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios @xcite .",
    "however , for external galaxies , the ensemble of hii regions , molecular gas , and pdrs will be observed as a whole .",
    "the low hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio in he 210 suggests that even an extreme starburst dominated by young hot stars can not easily produce a high hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio when observed at a large physical scale .",
    "the high ratios observed in lirgs are likely to have another cause than the extreme starburst scenario .",
    "a natural explanation for the high hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios in buried agn candidates is the increasing abundance of hcn due to strong x - ray radiation from the agn , as predicted by some simple chemical calculations @xcite .",
    "when both the hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) emission are optically thin , the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio will increase linearly with increasing hcn abundance relative to hco@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite and figure 9 show that even if the emission is moderately optically thick , the increasing hcn abundance results in a larger hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio ( see also knudsen et al .",
    "2007 ) . since the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 )",
    "brightness - temperature ratios in figure 8 derived from our nma / rainbow data are only toward the cores where putative agns are expected to be present , with a minimum contamination from extended starburst emission outside the beam size , the potential agn s x - ray chemistry , if any , may better be reflected than single - dish telescope s measurements .",
    "the critical density ( n@xmath47 ) hcn(10 ) is a factor of @xmath215 larger than that of hco@xmath0(10 ) ( @xmath42 4.1 ) .",
    "when the fraction of high density gas , above the hcn(10 ) critical density , increases , the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio could be high compared to low density gas . since lirgs have highly concentrated molecular gas in their nuclei @xcite and the density may be larger than the normal starburst galaxies studied by @xcite , the large hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios could originate simply in the increased molecular gas density .",
    "however , in this scenario , the hcn(10)/co(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios should be correspondingly high ( see @xmath424.1 ) .",
    "although hcn(10)/co(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios in the abscissa of figure 8 exhibit some ambiguities ( @xmath42 5.1 ) , no such expected trend is observed in figure 8 ( lirgs are not distributed in the right side ) , which does not support this high gas - density scenario . the expected high gas density in the nuclei of lirgs and non - high hcn(10)/co(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios can be reconciled if the higher average gas density in certain areas results from a larger volume - filling factor of the clump ( figure 9 ) , rather than the higher density of each clump .",
    "@xcite found a very large hcn(54)/hco@xmath0(54 ) brightness - temperature ratio in a luminous agn with strong mid - infrared 12 @xmath2 m continuum emission ( apm 08279 + 5255 ) , and suggested that infrared radiative pumping , rather than collisional excitation , can produce a high hcn / hco@xmath0 brightness - temperature ratio .",
    "in general , an agn is a more luminous mid - infrared 12 @xmath2 m continuum emitter than a starburst , because 12 @xmath2 m hot dust emission is stronger in the former .",
    "hence , the infrared pumping may work more effectively in lirgs with luminous buried agns than those without , which could also explain the high hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios seen in luminous buried agn candidates .",
    "@xcite proposed that the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio could increase with increasing turbulence of molecular gas . in this model",
    ", it is expected that the ratio is higher with larger line widths of hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) .",
    "figure 10 compares the line width with the ratio , but we see no clear positive trend .",
    "@xcite measured the hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) fluxes of lirgs using a single - dish telescope with @xmath425-arcsec beam size , and found a positive correlation between the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio and infrared luminosity .",
    "figure 11 shows the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratio only for the _ core _ emission inside 1.510 arcsec beam sizes as a function of infrared luminosity from the whole galactic region . among lirgs plotted in figure 11 ,",
    "the two lirgs dominated by a single main nucleus , mrk 231 and mrk 273 , were plotted in the figure of @xcite .",
    "the two lirgs with multiple main nuclei , arp 220 and arp 299 , were also studied by @xcite , but our interferometric data resolved the nuclei , providing essentially new plots .",
    "other lirgs in figure 11 are new .",
    "a positive correlation is also recognizable here with a different sample .",
    "if our agn s x - ray interpretation for the origin of high hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios is correct , then an increasing importance of agns at the cores of lirgs with higher infrared luminosities is suggested .",
    "investigating the spatial variation of the ratios using a better spatial - resolution map ( i.e. , separating a true compact core and surrounding extended regions ) may help to clarify the origin of the ratios .",
    "detailed theoretical calculations that solve chemical reaction networks in a self - consistent way and realistically account for the clumpy structure of molecular gas are also desirable for interpreting our observational results .",
    "we presented the results of millimeter interferometric hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) observations of nearby lirgs using the nma / rainbow array . when combined with other lirgs",
    "we have previously observed , ours is the largest interferometric hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) survey of lirgs .",
    "most of the observed lirgs are selected based on the presence of luminous agn signatures at other wavelengths . from the interferometric data",
    ", we extracted the hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) flux at the core positions , where the putative agns are expected to be present . for observationally investigating the possible chemical effects of the putative strongly x - ray - emitting agn to the surrounding interstellar gas ,",
    "our data set is much more advantageous than single - dish telescope s data because the contamination from extended starburst emission can be reduced .",
    "we derived the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios of lirgs and compared them to the ratios found in agns and starburst galaxies .",
    "1 .   lirgs with detected luminous agn signatures through observations at other wavelengths generally show high hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios and are distributed in the region occupied by agns .",

    "brightness - temperature ratios and the line widths of hcn(10 ) and hco@xmath0(10 ) , the high hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios observed in these lirgs are naturally explained by an hcn abundance enhancement as suggested by some simple theoretical models .",
    "we found a positive correlation between the hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios only toward the lirgs cores and infrared luminosities of lirgs , suggesting that agn activity is more important in galaxies with higher infrared luminosities .",

    "<S> we found that lirgs with luminous buried agn signatures at other wavelengths tend to show high hcn(10)/hco@xmath0(10 ) brightness - temperature ratios as seen in agn - dominated galaxies , while the wolf - rayet galaxy he 210 displays a small ratio . </S>",
