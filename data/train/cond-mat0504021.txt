    "<S> this regime of ultra - strong light - matter coupling is enhanced for long wavelength transitions , because for a given doping density , effective mass and number of quantum wells , the ratio @xmath2 increases as the square root of the intersubband emission wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the quantum properties of the ground state ( a two - mode squeezed vacuum ) , which can be tuned _ in - situ _ by changing the value of @xmath0 , e.g. , through an electrostatic gate . </S>",
    "<S> we finally point out how the tunability of the polariton quantum vacuum can be exploited to generate correlated photon pairs out of the vacuum via quantum electrodynamics phenomena reminiscent of the dynamical casimir effect .    in the last decade </S>",
    "<S> , the study of intersubband electronic transitions@xcite in semiconductor quantum wells has enjoyed a considerable success , leading to remarkable opto - electronic devices such as the quantum cascade lasers@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the more conventional interband transitions between conduction and valence bands , the frequency of intersubband transitions is not determined by the energy gap of the semiconductor material system used , but rather can be chosen via the thickness of the quantum wells in the active region , providing tunable sources emitting in the mid and far infrared .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most fascinating aspects of light - matter interaction is the so - called strong light - matter coupling regime , which is achieved when a cavity mode is resonant with an electronic transition of frequency @xmath1 , and the so - called vacuum rabi frequency @xmath0 exceeds the cavity mode and electronic transition linewidths . </S>",
    "<S> the strong coupling regime has been first observed in the late 80s using atoms in metallic cavities  @xcite , and a few years later in solid - state systems using excitonic transitions in quantum wells embedded in semiconductor microcavities  @xcite . in this regime , the normal modes of the system consist of linear superpositions of electronic and photonic excitations , which , in the case of semiconductor materials , are the so - called _ </S>",
    "<S> polaritons_. in both these systems , the vacuum rabi frequency @xmath0 does not exceed a very small fraction of the transition frequency @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , dini _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite have reported the first demonstration of strong coupling regime between a cavity photon mode and a mid - infrared intersubband transition , in agreement with earlier semiclassical theoretical predictions by liu@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric fabry - perot structure realized by dini _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite consists of a modulation doped multiple quantum well structure embedded in a microcavity , </S>",
    "<S> whose mirrors work thanks to the principle of total internal reflection . the strong coupling regime has been also observed in quantum well infra - red detectors@xcite . as we will show in detail , </S>",
    "<S> an important advantage of using intersubband transitions is the possibility of exploring a regime where the normal - mode polariton splitting is a significant fraction of the intersubband transition ( in the pioneering experiments by dini _ </S>",
    "<S> et al._@xcite , @xmath3 mev compared to @xmath4 mev ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , recent experiments have also demonstrated the possibility of a dramatic tuning of the strong light - matter coupling through application of a gate voltage @xcite which is able to deplete the density of the two - dimensional electron gas .    </S>",
    "<S> although the quest for quantum optical squeezing effects in the emission from atoms strongly coupled to a cavity mode has been an active field of research  @xcite , all systems realized up to now show a vacuum rabi frequency @xmath0 much smaller than the frequency of the optical transition . in this parameter regime , </S>",
    "<S> the relative importance of the anti - resonant terms in the light - matter coupling is small and , as far as no strong driving field is present , they can be safely neglected under the so - called rotating - wave approximation . in the presence of a strong driving field , however , anti - resonant terms are known to play a significant role , giving , e.g. , the so - called bloch - siegert shift in magnetic resonance experiments  @xcite , or determining the quantum statistical properties of the emission from dressed - state lasers  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a few theoretical studies have pointed out the intrinsic non - classical properties of exciton - polaritons in solid - state systems  @xcite , but the small value of the ratio @xmath5 , typically less than @xmath6 , has so far prevented the observation of quantum effects due to the anti - resonant terms of the light - matter coupling . </S>",
    "<S> all the squeezing experiments that have been performed so far in fact required the presence of a strong coherent optical pump beam in order to inject polaritons and take advantage of nonlinear polariton parametric processes  @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we show that in the case of _ intersubband _ cavity polaritons , it is instead possible to achieve an unprecedented _ ultra - strong coupling _ regime , in which the vacuum rabi frequency @xmath0 is a large fraction of the intersubband transition frequency @xmath1 . to this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> transitions in the far infrared are most favorable , because the ratio @xmath2 scales as the square root of the intersubband emission wavelength . within a second quantization formalism , we characterize the polaritonic normal modes of the system in the weak excitation limit , in which the density of intersubband excitations is much smaller than the density of the two - dimensional electron gas in each quantum well ( in this very dilute limit , the intersubband excitations behave as bosons ) . </S>",
    "<S> we point out the non - classical properties of the ground state , which consists of a two - mode squeezed vacuum . as its properties </S>",
    "<S> can be modulated by applying an external electrostatic bias , we suggest the possibility of observing quantum electrodynamics effects , such as the generation of correlated photon pairs from the initial vacuum state . </S>",
    "<S> such an effect closely reminds the so - called dynamical casimir effect  @xcite , whose observation is still an open challenge and is actually the subject of intense effort . </S>",
    "<S> many theoretical works have in fact predicted the generation of photons in an optical cavity when its properties , e.g. the length or the dielectric permittivity of the cavity spacer material , are modulated in a rapid , non - adiabatic way  @xcite .    </S>",
