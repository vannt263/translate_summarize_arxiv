    "over the past few decades , low energy scale supersymmetry ( susy ) has appeared as the most efficient mechanism to solve the hierarchy problem and protect the higgs mass from unwanted large radiative corrections , in theories which attempt to unify the gauge couplings of the standard model ( sm ) at a high scale .",
    "implementing susy in these theories , one avoids the fine - tuning of the parameters to 30 decimals thus , the criterion of naturalness of the theory is satisfied . however , there is a much more severe fine - tuning problem , i.e. , that with regard to the cosmological constant which can not be solved in the context of the existing theories like supersymmetry , technicolor etc .",
    "the solution of this problem would require new threshold dynamics at a scale as low as @xmath12ev .",
    "it has been recently argued that the invention of a new mechanism which will solve the cosmological constant problem might offer a solution to the hierarchy problem as well .",
    "bearing in mind that such a mechanism will also give an explanation to the hierarchy of the mass scales , recently , the scenario of split supersymmetry has been proposed  @xcite according to which supersymmetry could be broken at a high scale @xmath13 which can be even of the order of the gut scale . in this scenario ,",
    "squarks and sleptons obtain large masses of the order of the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath13 , while the corresponding fermionic degrees , gauginos and higgsinos , remain light with masses at the tev scale .",
    "this splitting of the spectrum is possible when the dominant source of susy breaking preserves an r - symmetry which protects fermionic degrees to obtain masses at the scale @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "gauge coupling unification at a high scale @xmath10 can be achieved , while @xmath9 yukawa unification at @xmath10 is compatible with the @xmath14 low energy ratio in split supersymmetry  @xcite . in has been further argued that in certain d - brane constructions , the presence of internal magnetic fields  @xcite provide a concrete realization of split supersymmetry  @xcite , therefore , intermediate or higher string scales are also viable since there is no hierarchy problem in this case .    in a previous paper  @xcite ,",
    "based on d - brane constructions originally proposed in  @xcite , we analyzed the gauge coupling evolution of d - brane inspired models with gauge symmetry @xmath15 at the string scale .",
    "we restricted our analysis in non - supersymmetric configurations with two or three abelian branes ( @xmath16 ) where only one higgs doublet couples to the up quarks and a second one to the down quarks and leptons , while all fermion and higgs fields are obtained from strings attached on different brane stacks .",
    "we examined six models which arise in the context of these two brane configurations due to the different hypercharge embeddings and different @xmath2 brane orientations , and calculated the string scale in partial gauge coupling unification scenarios , where the @xmath2 branes are aligned either to the @xmath4 or to the @xmath3 brane stacks .",
    "it was shown that the string scale depends strongly on the particular orientation of the @xmath2 branes and the hypercharge embedding . there",
    "exist particular embeddings which allow a string scale of a few tev , while in other d - brane configurations the string scale raises up to intermediate or even higher mass scales .",
    "we further investigated the possibility of obtaining the correct @xmath8 relation at @xmath17 for @xmath9 yukawa equality at the string scale and found that this is possible for the class of models with string scale of the order @xmath18gev .",
    "further interesting issues on the effective field theory of this class of models  @xcite have also been analyzed in detail by the authors of ref.@xcite .    in view of the interesting results obtained in split supersymmetry , as well as the possibility pointed out in  @xcite , that the d - branes might provide a natural realization for the spectrum of split susy , in the present work ,",
    "we wish to extend our previous analysis  @xcite ( including also the models proposed in  @xcite ) , and work out various interesting phenomenological issues which reveal the fundamental differences for their non - supersymmetric , supersymmetric and split supersymmetry versions .",
    "we thus start with a classification of the various d - brane derived models with standard model gauge symmetry extended by @xmath2 factors . in particular , we analyse various interesting phenomenological issues of the brane configurations with @xmath0 symmetry , where the number of additional @xmath2 branes is at most three , @xmath1 , so that an economical higgs sector arises .",
    "we calculate the string unification scale , we discuss the successful @xmath9 equality of the traditional grand unified theories ( guts ) and calculate the gaugino masses for a wide split - susy range and different initial conditions .",
    "moreover , we seek preferable solutions that accommodate a right - handed neutrino @xmath19 with appropriate mass ( which is usually of the order of the string scale ) , so that the ` see - saw ' mechanism results to a sub - ev effective majorana mass scale for the left - handed neutrino component @xmath20 , as required by experimental and cosmological data .",
    "we further examine how these models are discriminated by their different predictions for the gaugino masses and the life - time of the gluino .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present the general set up of the d - brane constructions based on the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "we consider all possible configurations with @xmath1 abelian branes and find the different hypercharge embeddings compatible with the sm particle spectrum . in section 3 we perform a one - loop rg analysis to calculate the string scale for the models obtained in section 2 , both for the case of parallel as well as intersecting brane scenarios . in section 4",
    "we discuss the fermion mass relations of the third generation and in particular we examine the possibility of obtaining the correct bottom - tau mass ratio for @xmath9 yukawa equality at the string scale .",
    "gaugino masses and the lifetime of the gluino are discussed in section 5 , while in section 6 we draw our conclusions .",
    "we consider models with sm gauge symmetry extended by several @xmath2 factors which arise in the context of certain d - brane configurations .",
    "the basic ingredient of such d - brane constructions is the brane stack , i.e.  a certain number of parallel d - branes which sit at the same point in the transverse space .",
    "a single d - brane carries a @xmath2 gauge symmetry , while a stack of @xmath21 parallel branes gives rise to a @xmath22 gauge theory where its gauge bosons correspond to open strings having both their ends attached to the various brane stacks .",
    "in flat space @xmath23-branes lead to non - chiral matter whilst chirality arises when they are wrapped on a torus  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the case of intersecting branes chiral fermions sit in singular points in the transverse space while the number of fermion generations , and other fermions , are related to the two distinct numbers of brane wrappings around the two circles of the torus .",
    "we note in passing that the intersecting branes are the t - dual picture of d - brane case where one turns on magnetic fields  @xcite to stabilize the closed string moduli . for two stacks @xmath24 ,",
    "the gauge group is @xmath25 while the fermions ( which live in the intersections ) belong to the bi - fundamental representations @xmath26 , or @xmath27 .    in our particular constructions",
    "the non abelian part of the gauge group is chosen to be the minimal one needed to accommodate the @xmath28 and @xmath29 gauge symmetries of the sm .",
    "we further assume the existence of @xmath30 extra @xmath2 abelian branes , thus the full gauge group is g = u(3)_c_l^n [ ggg ] since @xmath31 , the particular d - brane construction automatically gives rise to models with @xmath32 gauge group structure , while sm fermions may carry additional quantum numbers under these extra @xmath2 s .",
    "thus , a general observation on the derivation of sm from d - branes , even in its simplest realization , is that , besides the linear combination related to the standard hypercharge factor , several @xmath2 factors are involved .",
    "many of these @xmath2 s are anomalous , however , their anomalies are canceled by a generalized green - schwartz mechanism .",
    "the corresponding gauge bosons eventually become massive and the associated @xmath2 gauge symmetries are broken .",
    "some of these @xmath2 s are associated with the conservation of fermion numbers .",
    "it can be seen that , when quarks and leptons belong to the bifundamentals , the abelian factor obtained from @xmath33 is related to the baryon number since all quarks , which transform non - trivially under the color gauge group , have the same ` charge ' under @xmath34 . even when the corresponding gauge symmetry is broken , a global symmetry remains at low energies which eliminates various baryon number violating operators  @xcite .",
    "the existence of many @xmath2 factors allows in principle various embeddings of the hypercharge , provided that the sm spectrum arises with the correct ` charges ' under these embeddings . for the case considered in the present work , the most general hypercharge gauge coupling condition can be written as follows for the @xmath22 generators and assumed that the vector representation ( @xmath35 ) has abelian charge @xmath36 and thus the @xmath2 coupling becomes @xmath37 where @xmath38 the @xmath39 coupling.]=++2_i=1^n [ gy]for a given hypercharge embedding the @xmath40 s can be determined and equation ( [ gy ] ) relates the weak angle @xmath41 with the gauge coupling ratios at the string scale @xmath42 by : k_y & & = + 4 k_2 ^ 2 + 2_i=1^n k_i^2[ky ] where @xmath43 .",
    "note that , in a d - brane context the gauge couplings do not necessarily attain a common value at the string ( brane ) scale , so in general , the ratios @xmath44 , @xmath45 differ from unity there .",
    "however , in some classes of models several relations enter between the gauge couplings at @xmath10 and a partial unification is feasible .",
    "we start our investigation considering the case where some @xmath2 branes are superposed with the @xmath4 stack , whilst the remaining ones are aligned with the @xmath3 stack .",
    "therefore , if we assume that @xmath46 @xmath47 parallel @xmath2 branes ( with @xmath48 couplings ) are aligned with the @xmath4 brane , while the remaining @xmath49 @xmath2 branes ( with @xmath50 couplings ) are superposed with the @xmath3 brane , this implies at @xmath10 that the couplings @xmath48 are equal to @xmath51 , while @xmath50 are equal to @xmath52 .",
    "we then can write @xmath53 at the string scale ask_y&&=n_1+n_2,[ky1 ] where we have defined the gauge coupling ratio @xmath54 entering in ( [ ky1 ] ) by&= & and the coefficients @xmath55 byn_1=6 k_3 ^ 2 + 2_i=1^n k_i^2 ,   n_2=4 k_2 ^ 2 + 2_i = n+1^n k_i^2.[n1n2 ] in our d - brane construction each sm particle corresponds to an open string stretched between pairs of @xmath4 , @xmath3 and extra @xmath56 brane sets and belongs to some bi - fundamental representation of the associated unitary groups .",
    "yet , higher antisymmetric or symmetric representations could also be obtained by considering strings with both ends on the same brane set .",
    "for example , when only one abelian brane is included beyond the non - abelian ones , some of the standard model fermions should be accommodated in these antisymmetric representations  @xcite . on the contrary for the cases",
    "@xmath16 we will see that all known fermions can be accommodated solely to bi - fundamental representations .",
    "more abelian branes could also be added , however , we restrict here only to @xmath57 in order to ensure an economical higgs sector and implement a @xmath58 yukawa unification at @xmath10 , where down quarks and leptons acquire their masses from a common higgs .",
    "we start our analysis with the minimal gauge symmetry obtained when only one abelian brane ( @xmath60 ) is included beyond the @xmath61 stacks .",
    "indeed , in @xcite it was shown that the embedding of the sm can be realized in a minimal set of only three brane - stacks .",
    "three distinct models @xmath62 were constructed in the context of @xmath63 symmetry , represented by the three brane configurations shown in fig .",

    "this mass term together with the soft higgs doublet masses are appropriately fine - tuned so that one linear higgs combination is light , while the second one is of the order of the split susy scale @xmath202 .",
