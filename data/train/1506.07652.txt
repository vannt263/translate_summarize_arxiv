    "following our previous works @xcite , we continue to explore new natural supersymmetry ( susy ) beyond the conventional situation , the latter of which is severely challenged by the present lhc data .",
    "the conventional natural susy is heavily based on the understanding of the naturalness , which means that the weak scale should be not sensitive to the variation of the fundamental susy parameters labelled by @xmath0 .",
    "the sensitivity can be measured by defining a fine tuning parameter @xmath1 @xcite , where @xmath2 the requirement that the fine - tuning should not be too large , for example @xmath3 , leads to natural susy mass spectrum beneath tev scale .",
    "unfortunately , the present lhc data , especially about the higgs mass @xcite and the lower bounds @xcite on susy particle masses , disfavors such conventional natural susy in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "this is the main motivation for the study of new natural susy .    among the efforts to construct new natural susy , re - understanding the upper bounds on susy mass spectrum due to",
    "the naturalness argument is an interesting direction .",
    "as susy mass spectrum is usually obtained through messengers that transmit the susy breaking effects in the susy - breaking sector to the mssm , it actually depends on few mass parameters less than one expects naively , namely the susy - breaking scale and the susy - breaking mediation scale . in this sense ,",
    "the upper bounds on natural susy mass spectrum are over estimated . along this line",
    "it was shown in @xcite that these upper bounds are relaxed to multi - tev scale in the light of cancellations among the large renormalization group ( rg ) effects .",
    "for more recent discussions , see @xcite .    the observation above can be extended to broader phenomenological applications .",
    "our technical strategy , which is viable to any well defined and perturbatively valid susy mode , is outlined as follows .",
    "+ @xmath4 , parameterize the susy mass spectrum at the input scale with a few unfixed parameters , which define the parameter space .",
    "+ @xmath5 , generate the susy mass spectrum at the weak scale with suspect @xcite or other similar codes .",
    "+ @xmath6 , impose the condition arising from dynamically reduced radiative correction ( drrc ) , @xmath7 \\leq -(200~{\\rm gev})^2,\\ ] ] which implies that cancellations among various large rg corrections to the up - type higgs mass squared indeed happen .",
    "the range in eq.([naturalness ] ) can be slightly adjusted .",
    "+ @xmath8 , impose the experimental constraints such as higgs mass , dark matter ( dm ) relic density , lower bounds on susy particle masses , etc .",
    "we will use the scenario of gaugino masses arising from the no - scale supergravity @xcite as an illustrating example . in this model the mass parameters at the input scale include three gaugino masses @xmath9 and @xmath10 term @xcite , all of which may only depend on the single susy - breaking scale once the mediation scale is identified . for example , if the input scale is chosen as the grand unification ( gut ) scale the number of mass parameters may reduce to one in simplified model , in which one obtains universal gaugino masses @xmath11 . however , this simplest case is excluded by the condition of drrc in eq.([naturalness ] ) .",
    "our parameterization for the parameter space is similar to some of earlier literature @xcite .",
    "however , there are three important differences , which are the new condition of drrc in eq.([naturalness ] ) , the latest lhc constraints in eq.([constraint ] ) , and a different choice on the input scale @xmath12 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we scan the parameter space in the context of mssm where we use suspect @xcite to calculate the higgs mass at the 2-loop level , gev difference between the 2-loop and 3-loop result when the susy mass spectrum is above 3 tev in the light of @xmath13 , which is a fortran code of 3-loop higgs mass calculation .",
    "the parameter space is not dramatically affected by the 2-loop approximation . ] and micromegas 4.1.8 @xcite to calculate the relic density of light and neutral higgsino .",
    "term , the neutral higgsino state mainly serves as the dm candidate .",
    "] in section 3 , we discuss the model building for the parameter space shown in the section 2 by employing the no - scale supergravity .",
    "finally , we conclude in section 4 .",
    "this section to devoted to explore the parameter space for the model of non - universal gaugino masses , which is parameterized by the three gaugino masses , @xmath10 term and @xmath14 , @xmath15 the following constraints are imposed in the light of the lhc data about the higgs mass  @xcite and susy mass bounds  @xcite , @xmath16 the last constraint in eq.([constraint ] ) is expected to be one of main results in drrc induced natural susy , which obviously differs from the conventional natural susy mass spectrum .",
    "the constraints in eq.([constraint ] ) guarantee all present lhc data about susy can be easily explained .",
    "once the input mass scale @xmath12 is chosen , the susy mass spectrum at the weak scale can be calculated . instead of the choice on @xmath17 gev in some of previous works ,",
    "we take @xmath12 as the plank mass scale @xmath18 .",
    "the main reason for this different choice is that we would like to obtain large mass splitting among the gaugino masses other than the universal case .",
    "this can be realized in various ways .",
    "for instance , when the higher order corrections @xcite to the gaugino masses are not small , which implies that in the context of no - scale supergravity @xmath12 must be close to the plank mass , one may obtain large mass splittings among gaugino masses .    in terms of the code",
    "suspect 2.41 @xcite we show in fig.[fig1 ] the parameter space which satisfies drrc in eq.([naturalness ] ) and all the constraints in eq.([constraint ] ) simultaneously in the range , @xmath19 we have used two dimensional real numbers @xmath20 and @xmath21 to parameterize the gaugino masses , @xmath22 the pattern in fig.[fig1 ] indicates that similar to the case of focus point @xcite cancellations among large rg corrections to @xmath23 indeed happens . in order to satisfy the condition of drrc ,",
    "the bino mass is always the biggest one among the three gaugino masses , and the ratios @xmath24 and @xmath25 both decrease as @xmath26 increases .    as @xmath27",
    "are far above the weak scale , the neutral higgsino can serve as the dm candidate , which should not excess the relic density measured by the combination of plank and wimp 9-year data  @xcite , @xmath28 we show in fig.[fig2 ] the relic density of light and neutral higgsino in terms of micromegas 4.1.8 @xcite , which indicates that it can not fully accommodate dm relic density in the most of the parameter space .",
    "this is consistent with an analytic approximation @xcite for the case of higgsino dm , @xmath29     and @xmath21 for different ranges for @xmath26 , which satisfies all the constraints in eq.([constraint ] ) and drrc in eq.([naturalness ] ) simultaneously .",
    "@xmath30 ( left ) and 20 ( right ) , respectively.,width=288 ]     and @xmath21 for different ranges for @xmath26 , which satisfies all the constraints in eq.([constraint ] ) and drrc in eq.([naturalness ] ) simultaneously .",
    "@xmath30 ( left ) and 20 ( right ) , respectively.,width=288 ]    as shown in the right plot in fig.[fig2 ] , this estimate changes mildly for a different value of @xmath14 , thus more sensitive to the value of @xmath10 . if one adopts more negative @xmath23 than in eq.([naturalness ] ) , larger @xmath10 will be induced in terms of the conditions of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "so , higgsino can accommodate dm relic density with the price of larger fine tuning .",

    "in this section we employ the no - scale supergravity to construct the model of non - universal gaugino masses with parameter space shown in fig.[fig1 ] and fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "it was firstly shown in @xcite that this theory can address the cosmological constant and mass hierarchy problems simultaneously .",
    "we briefly review the phenomenology of no - scale supergravity .",
    "we take the adjoint field under the representation @xmath31 of @xmath32 for example , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of which spontaneously breaks this @xmath32 into the sm gauge group @xmath33 .",
    "the soft susy mass spectrum includes gaugino masses , which are given by , @xmath34 where @xmath35 refers to the gravitino mass , @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the three fine structure constants of sm gauge coupling and the fine structure constant of @xmath32 gauge group , respectively .",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are a set of functionals of the vevs of the adjoint field(s ) and scalars in the susy - breaking sector , the definitions of which can be found in @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the information about the susy - breaking sector are restored in these three dimensionless quantities .",
    "in particular , the magnitude of @xmath40 and @xmath41 are controlled by the input mass scale @xmath12 relative to @xmath42 .",
    "if @xmath12 is far smaller than @xmath42 such as in gut - scale susy models and @xmath40 is small , they lead to an approximate relation from eq.([gauginos ] ) , @xmath43 then the differences among @xmath27 at scale @xmath12 depend on the splitting of magnitudes among @xmath36 at the same scale .",
    "this splittings are determined by the coefficients @xmath44 which are defined as , @xmath45f_3 = \\alpha_2 [ m]f_2 = \\alpha_1[m]f_1=\\alpha_{5},\\ ] ] the differences among @xmath46 are constrained by the measured values of gauge couplings and the weak mixing angle @xmath47 at the weak scale @xcite .",
    "one finds that the universal relation @xmath48 is approximately valid for @xmath12 far below the plank mass scale .",
    "this implies that universal gaugino masses are expected .",
    "the universal gaugino masses can be violated either when @xmath40 is significant @xcite , the spontaneous breaking patterns of @xmath32 are other than @xmath31 @xcite , the @xmath32 is extended into larger group structure @xcite or @xmath12 is close to @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the last situation implies that @xmath41 which captures the leading order correction also becomes significant .",
    "as chosen for the analysis in the previous section , we have in terms of eq.([xy ] ) and eq.([gauginos ] ) for the case of @xmath49 tev , @xmath50 which implies that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "alternatively , one may extend the @xmath32 into a larger group structure , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the gauge group of hidden sector .",
    "the spontaneous breaking scale of @xmath54 is assumed to be larger than @xmath12 . given the general choice @xmath55 , the sm gauge group @xmath56 is regarded as the diagonal subgroup of @xmath57 , etc , where @xmath58 labels the hidden sector .",
    "the gaugino masses are read from the lagrangian in the gauge eigenstate formalism , @xmath59 which gives rise to , @xmath60 assume the magnitudes of all gauge couplings of same order @xmath61 .",
    "the large mass splittings as required in the previous section can be explained by @xmath62",
    "in this paper , the scheme for a new type of natural susy is proposed .",
    "this scheme is valid for models in which the susy mass spectrum at the input scale depdends on a single fundamental mass scale .",
    "it is usually true when the mediation scale of susy breaking is identified as the spontaneous breaking scale of some hidden gauge symmetry .    as an illustration for the scheme",
    ", we employ the scenario of non - universal gaugino masses , which can be easily constructed in the context of no - scale supergravity .",
    "no - scale supergravity is a typical example in which the mediation scale of susy breaking is set by the spontaneous breaking scale of the @xmath32 gauge symmetry .",
    "we have shown that in such model susy mass spectrum far above the tev scale is indeed natural , and that a small part of parameter space can explain the higgs mass constraint and all present lhc data about susy .",
