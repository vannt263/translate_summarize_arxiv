    "<S> we give a brief review of two nonperturbative phenomena typical of noncommutative field theory which are known to lead to the perturbative instability known as the uv - ir mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the first phenomena concerns the emergence / evaporation of spacetime geometry in matrix models which describe perturbative noncommutative gauge theory on fuzzy backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we show that the transition from a geometrical background to a matrix phase makes the description of noncommutative gauge theory in terms of fields via the weyl map only valid below a critical value @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the second phenomena concerns the appearance of a nonuniform ordered phase in noncommutative scalar @xmath1 field theory and the spontaneous symmetry breaking of translational / rotational invariance which happens even in two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this phenomena also originates in the underlying matrix degrees of freedom of the noncommutative field theory . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore it is conjectured that in addition to the usual wf fixed point at @xmath2 there must exist a novel fixed point at @xmath3 corresponding to the quartic hermitian matrix model .    </S>",
