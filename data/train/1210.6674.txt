    "@xcite inaugurated core - collapse supernova theory with their seminal prediction that `` a super - nova represents the transition of an ordinary star into a neutron star . '' the very basics of this theory , summarized authoritatively by @xcite , were confirmed by the observation of neutrinos from sn 1987a @xcite : the electron - degenerate core of a massive star ( with mass @xmath3 at zero - age main sequence [ zams ] ) , once having reached its effective chandrasekhar mass , becomes radially unstable .",
    "collapse ensues and , once fully dynamic , separates the core into the homologous , subsonically contracting inner core and the outer core , which is supersonically infalling . when the inner core reaches nuclear density , the nuclear force , which is repulsive at short distances , leads to a stiffening of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "the dramatically increased pressure support stabilizes the inner core , which overshoots its new equilibrium , then rebounds into the still infalling outer core .",
    "core bounce _ launches a hydrodynamic shock wave , which , endowed with the kinetic energy of the inner core , plows into the outer core .",
    "its progression is , however , soon muffled by energy losses to the dissociation of heavy nuclei and to electron capture neutrinos that are created and stream out from now optically - thin regions behind the shock .",
    "the hydrodynamic shock thus succumbs to the extreme ram pressure of the outer core and turns into a stalled accretion shock . in the commonly accepted picture of the _ neutrino mechanism _",
    "@xcite , the shock is revived by the deposition of neutrino energy in a layer of net neutrino heating ( the _ gain _ layer ) below the shock . in an alternative scenario , requiring very rapid progenitor rotation and efficient magnetic field amplification , a magnetorotational explosion may occur ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in order to leave behind a slowly cooling neutron star and not a black hole",
    ", shock revival must occur within a few hundred milliseconds of bounce @xcite .",
    "while the general picture of core - collapse supernova theory may be well established , details of the explosion mechanism , its dependence on precollapse conditions and input physics , and its neutrino and gravitational wave signals remain to be determined by detailed first - principles numerical simulations .    in the case of the neutrino mechanism , modern spherically - symmetric ( 1d ) simulations with full boltzmann neutrino transport",
    "have shown that neutrino heating alone fails to drive an explosion in all but the lowest - mass massive stars @xcite .",
    "spherical symmetry , however , is a poor approximation to the situation after core bounce , even if the initial conditions are nearly spherically symmetric .",
    "the weakening shock leaves behind a negative entropy gradient , which is expected to lead to convective instability within milliseconds after bounce ( _ prompt convection _ ) . somewhat later",
    ", neutrino heating establishes a negative entropy gradient in the gain region , leading to _ neutrino - driven convection_. strong deleptonization near the neutrinosphere ( where the neutrino optical depth @xmath4 ; located at the edge of the protoneutron star at @xmath5 ) establishes a negative lepton gradient , driving _ protoneutron star _ convection .    the first full axisymmetric ( 2d ) simulations @xcite showed that 2d neutrino - driven convection could increase the efficacy of the neutrino mechanism by increasing the residence time of accreted material in the region of net neutrino heating and leading to high - entropy turbulent flow that aids shock expansion .",
    "a new instability , the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) , was discovered by @xcite , who carried out idealized 2d simulations of an accretion shock using an analytic eos , neutrino cooling , but no neutrino heating . in 2d",
    ", the sasi leads to large scale , low - order ( in terms of spherical harmonics , @xmath6 ) deformations of the shock front that vary in time in a predominantly @xmath7 sloshing - type motion up and down the symmetry axis .",
    "these aspherical motions lead to larger average shock radii , increase the dwell time of material in the gain region , may lead to secondary shocks , and are thus generally aiding the explosion mechanism @xcite . in 3d ,",
    "nonaxisymmetric modes @xmath8 are excited as well , leading to more complex dynamics and smaller saturation amplitudes for individual modes @xcite . in some 3d simulations ,",
    "in particular in those that include some initial rotation , a strong spiral mode ( @xmath9 ) , capable of redistributing angular momentum , has been observed @xcite .",
    "perturbation theory and carefully controlled numerical experiments suggest that the sasi is driven by an advective - acoustic cycle in which entropy and vorticity perturbations are advected from the shock front to the edge of the protoneutron star . there",
    "they trigger the emission of acoustic perturbations that travel upstream in the subsonic flow of the postshock region and amplify perturbations in the shock front , thus creating a feedback cycle that injects power preferentially into low - order modes ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the saturation of the sasi has been proposed to occur via parasitic rayleigh - taylor and/or kelvin - helmholtz instabilities that operate on the entropy gradients and vorticity generated by the sasi @xcite .    in a real core - collapse supernova ,",
    "neutrino - driven convection and sasi overlap in space and may grow at the same time . in the linear regime , in which seed perturbations are minute",
    ", they can be clearly separated : sasi s fastest growing mode is @xmath7 , while convective eddies will grow with horizontal wavelengths a few times of the entropy scale height , giving @xmath10 in the postbounce supernova context ( based on estimates of @xcite ; see also @xcite ) . in convection , however , all modes are unstable and will eventually grow to nonlinear amplitudes if convection is able to develop at all .    how convection and sasi interact in the nonlinear regime , which of them becomes the dominant instability , how this may depend on the dimensionality ( 2d vs.  3d ) , and the ramifications of all this for the explosion mechanism are open questions that are currently under much debate .",
    "@xcite argued , based on linear theory , that in the absence of large ( i.e. , nonlinear ) perturbations the development of neutrino - driven convection may be suppressed if slowly developing eddies are advected out of the convectively unstable region before they can grow significantly . in this scenario",
    ", sasi would be the primary instability .",
    "this was also found in the idealized simulations of @xcite , who studied the 2d evolution of an artificially set up accretion shock with a constant accretion rate and analytic neutrino cooling , heating , and deleptonization functions . @xcite",
    "performed 2d energy - averaged ( gray ) neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics postbounce simulations of a @xmath11-@xmath1 progenitor star in a carefully controlled setting to study the development of the sasi .",
    "they , too , confirmed the result of @xcite and showed that if sufficiently large ( @xmath12 ) perturbations from sphericity are present in the upstream flow , neutrino - driven convection becomes the primary and dominant instability .",
    "if linearly - growing convection is suppressed by high advection velocities in the gain region , then one would expect a dependence of the relative importance of sasi and convection on the postbounce accretion rate and , hence , on the progenitor star .",
    "this was convincingly confirmed by the recent work of @xcite , who carried out full first - principles 2d general - relativistic ( gr ) multi - energy radiation - hydrodynamics postbounce simulations of a @xmath13-@xmath1 low - metallicity star with a small core and low postbounce accretion rate and of a @xmath0-@xmath1 star of solar metallicity with a large core and high accretion rate . in agreement with the prediction of @xcite",
    ", they found strong convection and absent sasi in the @xmath13-@xmath1 star and strong sasi and nearly absent convection in the @xmath0-@xmath1 progenitor . in both cases , explosions developed within @xmath14@xmath15 of bounce .    in a different line of research targeted at understanding the dependence of the neutrino mechanism on dimensionality ,",
    "@xcite carried out 1d , 2d , and 3d newtonian collapse simulations of a @xmath11-@xmath1 progenitor .",
    "they used the simple analytic heating and cooling prescription introduced by @xcite ( hereafter the mb08 `` light - bulb '' scheme ) on the basis of the work of @xcite .",
    "their 3d simulations did not show a dominant @xmath7 oscillatory sasi mode observed in 2d @xcite . using the critical luminosity vs.  accretion rate approach of @xcite",
    ", they reported that in 3d explosions could be obtained at @xmath14@xmath16 and @xmath14@xmath17 lower neutrino luminosities than in 2d and 1d , respectively .",
    "the @xcite 3d vs.  2d result was not confirmed by @xcite .",
    "these authors performed newtonian simulations with neutrino approximations very similar to the mb08 light bulb , but used a different 3d hydrodynamics code .",
    "they did not find clear evidence that 3d effects facilitate the development of an explosion to a greater degree than the non - radial motions due to sasi and convection in 2d .",
    "however , in agreement with @xcite , they did not find large - scale oscillatory low - order modes in their 3d simulations .",
    "they hypothesized that this may be less of a 3d effect than an effect of the rather simple treatment of neutrino heating and cooling by @xcite .",
    "the arguably greatest limitation of the mb08 light - bulb scheme is its inability to track the contraction of the protoneutron star , leading to too low advection velocities in the gain region , thus artificially favoring neutrino - driven convection over the sasi .",
    "the results of @xcite , whose newtonian 3d simulations used a multi - energy approximate neutrino transport scheme , appear supportive of this assertion . however , these simulations were carried out with very low resolution and the low - order modes appear to be clearly oscillatory only at early times .",
    "using the same mb08 light - bulb approximation for neutrinos and an updated version of the @xcite code , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite performed and analyzed another set of 2d and 3d simulations to investigate the roles of sasi and convection in the postbounce evolution of a @xmath11-@xmath1 progenitor .",
    "comparing 2d and 3d results for the evolution of low - order fluid mode amplitudes , @xcite showed that at the same mb08 driving luminosity , oscillatory mode amplitudes are much smaller in 3d than in 2d . in models that develop an explosion a non - oscillatory @xmath7 dipole asphericity grows already in the early postbounce evolution .",
    "furthermore , they showed that the oscillatory @xmath7 modes observed in 2d  and generally associated with the sasi  occur even in the case of a high light - bulb driving luminosity , in which neutrino - driven convection is the dominant instability .",
    "they argued that in successful explosions by the neutrino mechanism , neutrino - driven convection should be the dominant instability .",
    "however , for the reasons put forth by @xcite and @xcite and discussed in the above , the predictive power of these light - bulb simulations may be limited .",
    "ultimately , high - resolution 3d energy - dependent gr neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics simulations will be needed for final answers regarding the explosion mechanisms and the role of the various instabilities involved .",
    "such simulations are computationally extremely challenging and current attempts are forced to use low spatial resolution @xcite , the gray approximation @xcite , and/or employ an artificial inner boundary , cutting out the protoneutron star core @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present results from 3d hydrodynamic postbounce supernova calculations that attempt to strike a balance between the computationally cheap , but possibly too simplistic light - bulb approximation and true 3d radiation - hydrodynamics simulations , which can not yet be performed without at least partially debilitating limitations .",
    "our simulations use the ` zelmani ` core collapse simulation package @xcite and are fully general relativistic .",
    "we make no symmetry assumptions and use no artificial inner boundary .",
    "we employ a novel computational setup with a multi - block approach that provides curvilinear grid blocks to track the collapse of the outer core and cartesian adaptive - mesh refinement ( amr ) grids covering the central region , including the protoneutron star and the entire shock .",
    "we treat neutrinos in the postbounce phase with an energy - averaged three - species neutrino leakage scheme with neutrino heating .",
    "the only free parameter of this scheme is a scaling factor in the charged - current energy deposition rate .",
    "as we shall demonstrate , the leakage scheme captures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling , neutrino heating , and lepton number exchange .",
    "we apply ` zelmani ` to the collapse and postbounce evolution of the @xmath0-@xmath1 progenitor star that was considered by @xcite and shown to be highly susceptible to the sasi in their fully self - consistent 2d gr simulations .",
    "@xcite find a sasi - aided explosion that develops within @xmath14@xmath18 after bounce , making this progenitor ideal for studying the sasi in computationally expensive high - resolution 3d simulations .",
    "we carry out four simulations of the @xmath0-@xmath1 progenitor , varying the strength of neutrino heating .",
    "we evolve these four models from the onset of collapse to @xmath14@xmath19 after bounce at an effective angular resolution of @xmath20 at a radius of @xmath21 .",
    "the linear resolution at this radius is @xmath14@xmath22 .",
    "the maximum resolution covering the protoneutron star core is @xmath14@xmath23 .",
    "we find that neutrino - driven convection is able to grow from the numerical seed perturbations imposed by our cartesian amr approach .",
    "it becomes the dominant instability in the postbounce dynamics of all of our models . in the case of strong neutrino heating , convection , which is initially manifest as small - scale cells of rising hotter and sinking cooler material , develops into large blobs of high entropy material",
    "these push out the shock and lead to large - scale _ non - oscillatory _ shock deformations .",
    "we also observe growth of oscillatory low-@xmath24 deformations associated with the sasi .",
    "however , these saturate at small amplitudes that decrease further with increasing strength of neutrino heating and vigor of convection .",
    "the sasi remains sub - dominant at all times in our simulations .",
    "our results suggest that if neutrino - driven convection is able to grow in 3d  which will generally depend on the postbounce accretion rate and on the seed perturbations present in the flow @xcite  it will dominate the postbounce flow .",
    "this is consistent with the results obtained by @xcite with the simpler light - bulb approach .",
    "we extract the gravitational wave signals generated by accelerated quadrupole mass motions in our models and find that the strongest component of the signal comes from the initial burst of convection , which grows on the negative entropy gradient left behind by the stalling shock .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : methods ] we describe ` zelmani ` and give details on grid setup , eos , the leakage / heating scheme , and the progenitor model . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results of our simulations .",
    "first , in  [ sec : overall ] , we give an overview of the overall postbounce evolution of our models .",
    "we then discuss in detail the postbounce configurations resulting from our leakage / heating scheme (  [ sec : checkleak ] ) , the development of neutrino - driven convection and sasi (  [ sec : convsasi ] ) , various criteria for neutrino - driven explosions (  [ sec : criteria ] ) , and the gravitational wave signals extracted from our models (  [ sec : gws ] ) .",
    "we summarize our findings and conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we carry out our 3d gr simulations with the ` zelmani ` core collapse simulation package . `",
    "zelmani ` is based on the open - source ` einstein toolkit ` ( @xcite ) , for numerical relativity and relativistic computational astrophysics .",
    "it builds upon the ` carpet ` amr driver @xcite and the ` llama ` multi - block system @xcite within the ` cactus computational toolkit ` @xcite .",
    "we evolve the full einstein equations without approximations in a @xmath25 decomposition as a cauchy initial boundary value problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , using the conformal - traceless bssn formulation @xcite .",
    "a @xmath26 slicing condition @xcite controls the evolution of the lapse function @xmath27 , and a modified @xmath28-driver condition @xcite is used for the evolution of the coordinate shift vector @xmath29 .",
    "the bssn equations and the gauge conditions are implemented in the module ctgamma using fourth - order accurate finite differencing .",
    "implementation details are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that in its present form , our evolution system is limited to 3d simulations .",
    "an extension to 2d along the lines of @xcite may be possible in future work .",
    "we use a flux - conservative formulation of the gr euler equations , implemented in the gr hydrodynamics module ` grhydro ` , which is part of the ` einstein toolkit ` @xcite .",
    "` grhydro ` is an enhanced derivative of the ` whisky ` @xcite and ` gr - astro / mahc ` @xcite codes .",
    "it is based on a finite - volume high - resolution shock - capturing scheme and works with general finite - temperature microphysical eos .",
    "we employ the enhanced piecewise - parabolic method for reconstruction of state variables at cell interfaces ( @xcite ) and subsequently solve approximate riemann problems to compute intercell fluxes with the hlle solver @xcite .",
    "details are given in @xcite .",
    "both spacetime evolution and gr hydrodynamics are discretized in a semi - discrete fashion and coupled with the method of lines @xcite using a multi - rate runge - kutta integrator @xcite , providing fourth - order and second - order accuracy in time for spacetime and gr hydrodynamics , respectively . the time step is limited by the speed of light and we use a constant courant - friedrichs - lewy factor of @xmath30 .",
    "we employ the multi - block infrastructure llama @xcite , which allows us to cover the computational domain using a set of overlapping curvilinear grid blocks that are logically cartesian but physically curvilinear ( so - called `` inflated cubes '' ) , adapted to the overall spherical topology of the collapse problem .",
    "we employ a set of such curvilinear blocks to track the collapse of the outer core , while the interior domain containing the protoneutron star , the postshock region , and the shock itself is covered by an adaptively refined cartesian mesh ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : grid ] for a schematic view ) .",
    "the spherical inflated - cube multi - block system discretizes one spherical shell via six angular grid blocks designed such that one angular coordinate direction always coincides at inter - block boundaries .",
    "this allows us to use efficient fourth - order one - dimensional interpolation to update ghost zone information between neighboring blocks @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this particular multi - block system offers an almost uniform distribution of points across the sphere ( i.e.  without clustering of points at the poles ) , thus avoiding distortions and pathologies associated with standard spherical - polar grids .",
    "the adaptively refined central cartesian block is based on cell - centered and flux - conservative mesh - refinement techniques , provided by the open - source amr driver carpet @xcite .",
    "amr is implemented with subcycling in time , following the approach of @xcite .",
    "we make use of _ refluxing _ , which correctly adjusts fluxes at mesh refinement boundaries after the amr restriction operation @xcite .",
    "this ensures that mass , momentum , and energy fluxes are exactly conserved , even in the presence of strong shocks and other discontinuities .",
    "to update zones at amr boundaries and to initialize new grid points after regridding , we make use of fourth - order prolongation for the spacetime curvature variables , and second - order essentially non - oscillatory prolongation for the matter variables . as detailed in @xcite , spacetime variables are restricted from fine onto coarse grids using a third - order polynomial , while matter variables are restricted via cell averaging .",
    "all simulations are carried out with the same general grid setup . in the central region",
    ", we use five nested cartesian grids with a factor of @xmath31 in resolution between each of them .",
    "the finest grid has a linear cell size @xmath32 and extends out to @xmath33 .",
    "the second finest grid has a cell size of @xmath34 and extends to @xmath35 , while the third grid has @xmath36 and is set up to adaptively track the shock , ensuring that shock itself and the turbulent flow in the gain layer behind the shock are always resolved with no worse resolution than @xmath36 . for a shock radius of @xmath21 ,",
    "this corresponds to an effective angular resolution @xmath37 of @xmath14@xmath20 .",
    "there are two additional coarser grids with @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the cartesian region , which extends to @xmath40 , where it overlaps with the outer spherical cube grid .",
    "the latter s radial cell size @xmath41 at its inner boundary is the same as the @xmath42 of the coarsest cartesian grid it overlaps with .",
    "@xmath41 is held constant out to a radius of @xmath14@xmath43 and then smoothly reduced to @xmath44 at the outer boundary at @xmath14@xmath45 .",
    "each of the six cubed - sphere blocks has @xmath46 angular zones each in angle @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this corresponds to an effective cell size of @xmath14@xmath49 .",
    "we start our simulations at the onset of collapse with only the coarsest of the cartesian amr grids active and progressively activate the finer grids when the central density in the collapsing core reaches @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "we employ a tabulated version of the finite - temperature nuclear eos by @xcite .",
    "this eos is based on the compressible liquid - drop model with a nuclear symmetry energy of @xmath54 .",
    "we use its variant with a nuclear compression modulus @xmath55 of @xmath56 , since it yields a cold neutron star mass - radius relationship in agreement with current observational and theoretical constraints ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we employ the lattimer - swesty eos at densities above @xmath57 , where @xmath58 at all times in the core collapse context and nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) holds . at lower densities ,",
    "we employ the timmes eos @xcite and assume that the matter is an ideal gas composed of electrons , positrons , photons , neutrons , protons , alpha particles , and heavy nuclei with the average @xmath59 and @xmath60 given by the lattimer - swesty eos at the transition density .",
    "this is an approximation and may lead to slightly incorrect pressures in non - nse regions that result in changes in the collapse times for the silicon and carbon / oxygen shells . ideally , a fully consistent treatment with multiple advected chemical species , a nuclear reaction network and transition in and out of nse with a nse network as proposed by @xcite should be implemented .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "details on the eos table and on the implementation of the contribution of electrons , positrons , and photons , as well as other details of the construction of the table are described in @xcite .",
    "the table itself as well as table generation and interpolation routines are available at http://www.stellarcollapse.org .",
    "we employ the approximate neutrino treatment of the open - source code ` gr1d ` @xcite , which was adapted to 3d and implemented in the module ` zelmanileak ` by @xcite .",

    "when neutrinos begin to be trapped in the inner core , and throughout the postbounce phase , momentum exchange between neutrinos and matter becomes non - negligible .",
    "the effect of this `` neutrino stress '' is naturally captured by the coupling of radiation and matter in full neutrino transport calculations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in our approximate treatment , we must include it explicitly .",

    "after core bounce , which we define as the time at which the specific entropy at the edge of the inner core reaches @xmath69 , signaling shock formation , the simple @xmath66 approximation breaks down and fails to even qualitatively capture the effects of neutrino processes occurring in the postbounce phase .",
    "dissociation of iron - group nuclei by the shock provides a sea of free protons for electrons to capture on , leading to the neutronization burst of electron neutrinos ( @xmath70 ) and a steep drop of @xmath65 in the region just outside the nascent protoneutron star .",

    "we consider three neutrino species , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 , where we lump the heavy - lepton neutrinos together , since they participate only in neutral current processes and have very similar cross sections in the core - collapse supernova environment .",

    "this confirms the findings of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our results show that both instabilities can coexist and grow at the same time , but even if convection is suppressed ( a case we can not study in our 3d cartesian amr code ) , the nearly equal splitting of the @xmath318 power across the three azimuthal @xmath319 modes in 3d , will likely reduce the magnitude of deviations from sphericity that can be driven by the sasi alone . moreover ,",
    "the sasi , once it has reached its non - linear phase , will trigger neutrino - driven convection @xcite , which may very well become the dominant instability , in particular if neutrino heating is strong .      the simulations presented here end before an explosion is fully developed in any of our models .",
    "nevertheless , interesting trends can be observed .",
    "models @xmath148 and @xmath149 have strongly positively trending shock radii at the end of their simulations .",
    "the shock in model @xmath151 also expands at late times , but the development of an explosion is definitely more marginal .",

    "a variety of criteria for neutrino - driven explosions have been discussed in the literature and it is interesting to see how the trends observed in our models compare with what is expected from theory and other simulation results .    from the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : heat ] we find that models with stronger neutrino heating and , thus , more vigorous neutrino - driven convection have systematically more mass in the gain layer ( @xmath320 ) that can absorb neutrino energy .",
    "the low - amplitude sasi seen in our models , which is strongest in models with weakest heating and convection , does not appear to have any positive effect on @xmath320 in our simulations . in models that are trending towards explosion , @xmath320 increases as shock expansion sets in .",

    "the gw signals emitted by the other models are very similar and not shown .",
    "the early emission sets in @xmath14@xmath254 after bounce and is due to prompt convection that dominates the aspherical dynamics in the early postbounce phase , but has decayed by @xmath14@xmath140 after bounce .",

    "the subsequent evolution of the gw signals is similar in both models , both polarizations , and both observer positions .",

    "the gw emission transitions to higher frequencies , indicating that emission from deceleration of downflows at the steep density gradient at the edge of the protoneutron star ( as first pointed out by @xcite ) and convection in the protoneutron star play an increasing role . while both models have expanding shocks at the end of their simulations , the shock acceleration has not become sufficiently strong to lead to an offset in the gw signal ( gw memory ) seen in other work that followed exploding models to later times ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "this is comparable to , but somewhat larger than what @xcite found in the preexplosion phase of their models .",
    "this may be due the different progenitor models used and/or to the rather large inner boundary radius of their models in the preexplosion phase .",
    "our typical @xmath367 are also quantitatively consistent with the findings of the simpler 3d simulations of @xcite and @xcite , but are a factor of a few smaller than predictions from 2d simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "the spectra are scaled with a factor of @xmath369 to allow one - to - one comparison with the detector one - sided amplitude spectral noise density @xmath354 , which has units of @xmath370 .",
    "most of the detectable emission is within @xmath14@xmath371 and at essentially the same level of @xmath14@xmath372 .",
    "a galactic event ( at @xmath353 ) appears to be well detectable by the upcoming generation of detectors .",
    "all four models , while having distinct individual @xmath355 and @xmath356 time series that vary greatly in the time domain , exhibit essentially the same robust spectral features , independent of @xmath129 and the exact postbounce time the individual models are evolved to . the low - frequency to intermediate - frequency emission is most likely due to prompt convection in the early postbounce phase , while the high - frequency peaks at @xmath14@xmath373 and @xmath14@xmath374 are most likely due to the deceleration of downflows at the protoneutron star surface and protoneutron star convection .",
    "a more detailed investigation of these features must be left to future work , since it would require multiple quadrupole integrals to isolate emission regions as done , e.g. , by @xcite .",
    "our present simulations provide only one global quadrupole integral and we do not have sufficiently finely sampled output for a postprocessing analysis of the gw signal .    the total energy emitted in gws is @xmath375 in all our models and about @xmath376 of the emitted energy is due to the higher - frequency gw emission at later postbounce times .",
    "this finding is consistent with the 3d results of @xcite .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , found emitted gw energies of only @xmath14@xmath377 .",
    "their models do not include prompt convection and emit most of their gw energy at frequencies below @xmath14@xmath378 .",
    "this , again , may be due to the different considered progenitor structures and/or to the inner boundary of their simulations .",
    "we have carried out four 3d general - relativistic core collapse and postbounce simulations of the @xmath0-@xmath1 solar - metallicity progenitor of @xcite , systematically varying the rate of neutrino energy deposition to study the effect of variations in neutrino heating on the 3d postbounce evolution in general and on the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) in particular .",
    "these simulations neither employed an artificial inner boundary nor did they make any symmetry assumptions or approximations for the gravitational field .",
    "the resolution of our simulations is nearly twice as high and we carried them out for nearly twice as long as the only previous 3d gr study of @xcite .    for neutrinos",
    ", we used an energy - averaged ( gray ) three - species neutrino leakage / heating scheme in the postbounce phase , whose only free parameter is a scaling factor in the energy deposition rate .",
    "the leakage scheme captures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling , lepton number exchange , and neutrino heating as predicted by fully self - consistent 1d and 2d neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics simulations .",
    "importantly , our simulations do not suffer from the limitations of simpler analytic `` light - bulb '' heating / cooling schemes , which can not capture the contraction and deleptonization of the protoneutron star and result in artificially large shock radii and overestimated advection times through the postshock region ( @xcite , _ in prep . _ ) .",
    "the light - bulb approach , due to its simplicity and low computational cost , is being employed in many contemporary 3d simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , light - bulb calculations may yield qualitatively incorrect results for the postbounce hydrodynamics and the respective roles and relevance of neutrino - driven convection and the sasi .",
    "our approach was designed specifically to avoid the problems of the light - bulb scheme and provide a realistic postbounce setting for more robust conclusions on the postbounce evolution and the role of hydrodynamic instabilities . at the same time",
    ", our leakage / scheme is still computationally much cheaper and simpler than the approximate gray or energy - dependent 3d neutrino transport schemes of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this affords us with the ability to carry out parameter studies with high numerical resolution as presented in this work for the @xmath0-@xmath1 progenitor .",
    "@xcite previously carried out an axisymmetric ( 2d ) simulation of the same @xmath0-@xmath1 progenitor with their 2d gr radiation - hydrodynamics code .",
    "they found neutrino - driven convection to be suppressed due to the high postbounce accretion rate and , thus , short advection time through the convectively unstable gain layer .",
    "the sasi is the primary instability in their simulation and seeds convection , which grows only as a secondary instability once the sasi has reached non - linear amplitudes .",
    "our models show instead early and strong growth of convective instability .",
    "it is initially prompt , driven by the negative entropy gradient left behind by the stalling shock .",
    "subsequently , convection is driven by neutrino energy deposition in the gain layer .",
    "neutrino - driven convection first manifests itself in small - scale local rising hotter and sinking cooler blobs of postshock material . in models with strong neutrino heating that are trending towards explosion ,",
    "the small scale blobs combine over time to a few large , near volume - filling high - entropy regions whose expansion pushes out the shock .",
    "this was also observed in the high - luminosity light - bulb simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these large blobs lead to a low-@xmath166-mode dominated structure of the expanding shock .",
    "the shock , however , has a complicated substructure of protruding bumps caused by smaller - scale plumes that perturb it locally . models whose shock expansion becomes dynamical , surpass the runaway explosion criterion @xmath379 @xcite and satisfy the antesonic condition of @xcite . both criteria for explosion yield predictions consistent with the trends in our models .",
    "interestingly , shortly after the @xmath330 condition is met by our models , individual fluid cells behind the shock reach positive total energy , indicating the transition to explosion .",
    "while neutrino - driven convection is the fastest growing and overall dominant instability , our analysis suggests that all of our models exhibit some growth of clearly periodic low-@xmath166 deformations of the shock front that are characterstic of the linear phase of the sasi .",
    "as expected from linear perturbation analysis , we find that the @xmath380 modes exhibit the fastest growth .",
    "however , our results also show that the saturation amplitudes of the oscillatory @xmath315 modes are , in the best case , an order of magnitude smaller than in @xcite .",
    "the sasi remains a sub - dominant instability in all of our models .",
    "furthermore , we find the sasi to be strongest in the model with the least neutrino heating and the weakest neutrino - driven convection",
    ". models with stronger heating and more vigorous convection have lower saturation amplitudes of the oscillatory modes , but develop large _ non - oscillatory _ deformations of @xmath381 character that are caused by low - mode neutrino - driven convection and are unrelated to the sasi .",
    "our simulations satisfy all the requirements laid out by @xcite for the development of strong sasi in the @xmath0-@xmath1 progenitor : gr gravity , an eos that results in a fairly compact protoneutron star , and the inclusion of all neutrino species and deleptonization of the protoneutron star . yet",
    ", our results turn out to be very different from what @xcite found .",
    "what is the root cause of this discrepancy ?",
    "on the one hand , our simulations are 3d , splitting , on average , the 2d @xmath7 sasi power across three azimuthal @xmath319 modes .",
    "this may explain lower saturation amplitudes , but can not explain the early growth of neutrino - driven convection that is absent from the 2d simulation of @xcite . on the other hand ,  and ,",
    "as we are convinced , more importantly  our simulations used a central cartesian adaptive - mesh refinement ( amr ) grid , which imparts perturbations of order of @xmath382 onto the very early postbounce flow , seeding prompt convection .",
    "this , in turn , acts as seed for neutrino - driven convection in our models .",
    "the seed perturbations are sufficiently large for convection to develop despite the high accretion rate and correspondingly short advection time through the gain layer .",
    "neutrino - driven convection becomes dominant and limits the growth of the sasi , in agreement with the 2d work of @xcite .",
    "we expect any 3d simulation relying on 3d cartesian amr with similar resolution to have similarly large seed perturbations for convection .",
    "the recent 3d light - bulb simulations of @xcite are all subject to these perturbations .",
    "the question of the magnitude of seed perturbations was not raised by @xcite , who used a spherical - polar grid that leads to only minute perturbations from the growth of numerical noise during collapse .",
    "is the almost perfectly spherical postbounce state of @xcite representative of nature or should one expect significant asphericities to be present in the outer core ?",
    "some guidance on the size of perturbations induced by turbulent convection during late time burning in core - collapse supernova progenitors is already available from the 2d and 3d simulations of meakin , arnett , and collaborators @xcite .",
    "there are two important results from these multi - dimensional stellar evolution calculations that pertain to the expected density perturbation amplitudes in precollapse cores .",
    "first , 2d and 3d simulations of the oxygen shell burning dominated phase in a 23-star @xcite have clarified the basic mechanism responsible for the origin of the fluctuations . in short , @xcite found that the root - mean - square ( rms ) density fluctuations are largest at the convective boundaries . by interpreting the dynamics of the convective boundary layer in terms of g - modes excited by the turbulent convection",
    ", it was shown that the rms density fluctuation amplitude can be related directly to the background stellar structure and the mach number of the convective flow , with    @xmath383    where @xmath384 is the rms mach number of the convective flow ,",
    "@xmath252 is the brunt - visl frequency in the stable layer adjacent to the convection zone , @xmath385 is the sound speed of the gas , and @xmath386 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the first term on the right hand side , which is very small , is relevant to the interior of the convection zone , where density fluctuations arise solely from the presence of velocity fluctuations in a nearly adiabatic layer .",
    "the second term is significantly larger and applies to the stable layers bounding the convection zone , reflecting the excitation of fluid motions in these regions in the form of internal waves ( predominantly g - modes ) .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 progenitor of @xcite has a turbulent mach number of @xmath140.1 to 0.2 in the silicon burning convective shell overlying the core , and two peaks in @xmath252 of importance : the peak corresponding to the inner edge of the active silicon burning shell ( corresponding to the outer edge of the iron core ) , and a peak deeper in associated with the outermost extent of the now extinguished silicon burning core .",
    "both peaks have values of @xmath387 of @xmath141 , indicating that rms density fluctuations at these locations will be of order the turbulence mach number of the convection , or @xmath388 .",
    "the spike in @xmath252 associated with the outer extent of the silicon core burning epoch will be accreted into the shock within @xmath14@xmath159 of bounce , while the edge of the iron core will be accreted a little later , at @xmath1460  ms after bounce .",
    "the second result from the multi - d stellar convection simulations of meakin and arnett involves the interaction of nuclear burning shells at late times .",
    "while the results on boundary layer fluctuations described above are considered to be robust by those authors , the presence of two or more convective shells in close proximity , as found in late burnings stages , has been found to drive additional motion at the convective boundaries and correspondingly larger density fluctuation amplitudes . in the most relevant case of a silicon burning shell around an iron core , the interaction between the silicon , oxygen , neon , and carbon shells were found to produce a dramatic increase in boundary layer distortion , eventually leading to a complete disruption and mixing of the multi - shell burning region @xcite .",
    "this result is likely to be due , at least in part , to the inconsistency between the initial stellar model used ( based on mixing length theory ) and a more realistic turbulent convection as represented by the numerical simulation .",
    "judging the robustness of these shell - interaction results , however , awaits 3d simulations since all of the multi - shell calculations performed to date have been restricted to 2d geometry which is known to result in exaggerated velocities in regions of thermal convection . from this body of work , it would appear that the presence of density fluctuations with amplitudes of at least 1% , and possibly as large as 10 to 20% , should be expected in the material accreting into the shock at early postbounce times in a collapsing iron core .",
    "the fast growth of neutrino - driven convection in our current models is almost certainly caused by the large seed perturbations from our cartesian amr grid . in 2d simulations ,",
    "the growth of neutrino - driven convection may go along with sasi growth or , if not genuine sasi , then at least large - scale _ oscillatory _ low-@xmath166 deformations of the shock front @xcite .",
    "our 3d models do not exhibit any large - scale oscillatory features .",
    "rather , models evolving towards an explosion develop non - oscillatory large - scale asphericities at late times and produce a globally aspherical explosion morphology without a need for sasi - driven @xmath7 deformations .",
    "this qualitative finding is in agreement with the results of the convection - dominated 3d newtonian light - bulb calculations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the late - time development of sasi - like oscillatory behavior seen in 2d simulations that are initially convection dominated ( e.g. , @xcite ) may thus be an artifact of axisymmetry , but further work is required to solidify this conclusion .",
    "the next galactic core - collapse supernova will reveal its inner workings by means of its neutrino and gravitational - wave ( gw ) signals .",
    "both will provide key insight into the thermodynamics and multi - d dynamics of the protoneutron star and the postshock region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while our neutrino treatment is too simplistic to yield quantitatively interesting predictions of the neutrino signal , we are in a good position to study the gw emission from accelerated quadrupole mass motions in our models : for the first time , we have extracted gws from full 3d gr collapse and postbounce core - collapse supernova simulations .",
    "we find a strong burst of gws associated with early - postbounce prompt convection with frequencies around @xmath14@xmath389 , a subsequent almost quiescent phase , followed by higher - frequency ( @xmath390 ) emission , whose amplitudes are dominated by the deceleration of undershooting convective plumes at the edge of the protoneutron star ( cf .",
    "if convection ( prompt and/or neutrino - driven ) does not develop early , the gw signal would not have a strong initial burst , but rather a slow rise to smaller amplitudes at later times , when the sasi becomes strong .",
    "this is a key difference and may allow gw data analysts to distinguish between convection - dominated and sasi - dominated postbounce evolution in the next galactic core - collaspe supernova .",
    "the design sensitivities of advanced - generation gw detectors such as advanced ligo , advanced virgo , or kagra are likely to be sufficient to detect the collapse and neutrino - driven explosion in our @xmath0-@xmath1 progenitor throughout the milky way . while different in detail , our results for the gw signature are generally consistent with what was found for other progenitors in the 2d first - principles simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our gw signals have higher amplitudes and characteristic frequencies than predicted by the 3d simulations of @xcite , who employed an artifical inner boundary that was moved in according to an analytic prescription .",
    "there are a number of shortcomings and limitations of the simulations presented here that must be mentioned and can be removed only by future work .",
    "as is well known and has been pointed out recently by @xcite in the core collapse context , in 3d , turbulent power cascades to small scales .",
    "low resolution in 3d may artificially keep power at large scales and may thus lead to an overestimate of the positive effect of neutrino - driven convection . while our effective angular and radial resolution in the postshock gain layer is comparable to the highest resolution considered by @xcite , we agree with their assessment that understanding the resolution dependence of 3d results is of great importance",
    ". we will carry out a resolution study in future work .",
    "the second major limitation of our simulations is our cartesian amr grid and the fact that we must let the nascent supernova shock pass two mesh refinement boundaries before tracking its further evolution by amr .",
    "this induces large perturbations leading to the growth of prompt and neutrino - driven convection in all of our models .",
    "these large and essentially unavoidable seed perturbations for prompt and neutrino - driven convection make it difficult to draw conclusions on which hydrodynamic instability dominates in the early postbounce phase .",
    "this limitation is shared by other cartesian amr schemes .",
    "it could possibly be avoided in future work by extending our spherical - polar grid blocks all the way into the protoneutron star core and using a single high - resolution cartesian mesh only in the innermost few kilometers . also in future work , we intend to carry out a study in which we map a postbounce profile from a 1d collapse simulation onto our 3d grid after the shock has passed the radii of the inner refinement levels .",
    "this should allow us to investigate the role of seed perturbations in a more controlled way .",
    "a third major limitation of our work is the reliance on our simple gray heating / leakage scheme . while superior to the light - bulb approach",
    ", it can not replace the energy - dependent neutrino radiation - hydrodynamics treatment that has proven to be crucial for reliable conclusions on the neutrino mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the set of 3d general - relativistic hydrodynamics simulations presented here required about @xmath14@xmath67 million cpu hours to complete . adding energy - dependent 3d neutrino transport will increase the computational complexity by an order of magnitude .",
    "novel , highly efficient and scalable approaches to 3d neutrino transport will be needed to address this problem @xcite .",
