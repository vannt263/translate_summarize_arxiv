    "a very classical problem in dynamics consists in studying the hamiltonian system on the symplectic manifolds @xmath0 generated by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a small perturbation parameter .",
    "more general unperturbed systems @xmath3 can be considered instead of @xmath4 , but we restrict to that particular case in the present paper in order to simplify some notations . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the system is integrable , and the momenta @xmath6 are integrals of motion . for @xmath7 ,",
    "these variables undergo small oscillations .",
    "kam theory implies that these oscillations remain permanently bounded for many initial conditions . for other initial conditions ,",
    "a large evolution might be possible . by nekhoroshev theory",
    ", it must be extremely slow .",
    "the questions we discuss in the present text is whether this large evolution is actually possible , and to what geometric structures it is associated .",
    "let us consider a resonant momentum @xmath8 , and assume that @xmath9 is not resonant , which means that @xmath10 never belongs to @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "in order to study the dynamics near the torus @xmath13 , it is useful to introduce the notations @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 . in the neighborhood of the torus @xmath13 ,",
    "the dynamics is approximated by the averaged system @xmath17 where @xmath18 following a classical idea of poincar and arnold , we can try to exploit this observation by considering the system @xmath19 with a second perturbation parameter @xmath20 independent from @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath21 has a unique non - degenerate minimum , say at @xmath22 .",
    "fixing @xmath7 , we can study this system for @xmath23 small enough , which is a simpler problem which may give some hints about the dynamics of ( [ stable ] ) .",
    "the reason why instability is more easily proved in ( [ unstable ] ) than in ( [ stable ] ) is the presence of the hyperbolic fixed point at @xmath24 of the @xmath25 component of the averaged system . studying ( [ unstable ] ) for @xmath23 small enough is thus called the _ a priori _ unstable problem , or the _ a priori _ hyperbolic problem .",
    "in contrast , the hamiltonian ( [ stable ] ) is called _ a priori _ stable .",
    "the _ a priori _ unstable case is by now quite well understood for @xmath26 , see @xcite for example . the _ a priori _ unstable case for @xmath27 and",
    "the _ a priori _ stable case can be considered as widely open , in spite of the important announcements of john mather in @xcite . the starting point in the study of ( [ unstable ] )",
    "is the famous paper of arnold , @xcite . in this paper , arnold introduced a particular _ a priori _ unstable system where some geometric structures associated to diffusion , partially hyperbolic tori ( that he called whiskered ) , their stable and unstable manifolds , and heteroclinic connections , can be almost explicitly described .",
    "this geometric structure have been called a transition chain .",
    "most of the subsequent works on the _ a priori _ unstable problem have consisted in trying to find transition chains in more general cases , but understanding the general _ a priori _ unstable hamiltonian have required a change of paradigm : from partially hyperbolic tori to normally hyperbolic cylinders .",
    "the variational methods introduced by john mather in @xcite and ugo bessi in @xcite have also been very influential .    transforming the understanding gained on the dynamics of ( [ unstable ] ) to informations on the _",
    "a priori _ stable case is not an easy task . since we understand the system ( [ unstable ] ) when @xmath26 the first attempt should be to study ( [ stable ] ) in the neighborhood of an @xmath28-resonant line , for example the line consisting of momenta of the form @xmath29 .",
    "we could hope to prove the existence of drift along such a line by using the _ a priori _ unstable approximations near each value of @xmath6 .",
    "however , we face the problem that an approximation like ( [ unstable ] ) holds only in the neighborhood of the torus @xmath30 when the frequency @xmath31 is irrational . near the torus @xmath30 with @xmath32 rational",
    ", one should use an approximation of the form @xmath33 and different methods must be used .",
    "this is often called the problem of double resonances when @xmath34",
    ". we will call it the problem of _",
    "maximal resonances_.    our general goal in this paper is to study _ a priori _ unstable systems with a sufficient generality to be able to gain informations on the _ a priori _ stable case .",
    "we start with a relatively detailed description of the arnold s example in section [ arnold ] , which is also an occasion to settle some notations and introduce some important objects , like the partially hyperbolic tori , their stable and unstable manifolds , and the associated generating functions . working with these generating functions",
    "allows to highlight the connections between the various classical approaches , geometric methods , variational methods , and weak kam theory .",
    "then , from the end of section [ arnold ] to section [ general ] , we progressively generalize the setting and indicate how the methods introduced on the example of arnold can be improved to face the new occurring difficulties .",
    "we present the large gap problem , which prevents arnold s mechanism from being directly applied to general _ a priori _ unstable systems , and explain how the presence of a normally hyperbolic cylinder can be used to solve this problem and prove instability in general _ a priori _ unstable systems . in section [ hyper ] we give a new result from @xcite , on the existence of normally hyperbolic cylinders in the _ a priori _ stable situation , which should allow to apply the tools exposed in the previous sections to _ a priori _ stable systems .",
    "this suggests a possible strategy to prove the following conjecture :    for a typical perturbation @xmath35 , there exists two positive numbers @xmath36 and @xmath37 , such that , for each @xmath380,{\\ensuremath{\\epsilon}}_0[$ ] , the system ( [ stable ] ) has an orbit @xmath39 such that @xmath40 .",
    "we are currently working on this program in collaboration with vadim kaloshin and ke zhang .",
    "the same conjecture can be stated with a more general unperturbed system @xmath3 , and the same proof should work provided @xmath41 is convex and smooth .",
    "our strategy of proof does not consist in solving the maximal resonance problem , but rather in observing that the conjectured statement can be reached without solving that difficulty . in that respect ,",
    "what we expose is much easier than the project of mather as announced in @xcite . the result is weaker since only limited diffusion is obtained",
    "the maximal resonance problem has to be solved in order to prove the existence of global diffusion on a whole resonant line , or from one resonant line to another .",
    "our strategy , on the other hand , has the advantage of working with all @xmath42 , while mather is limited to @xmath34 at the moment .",
    "following arnold @xcite , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "we will often use the corresponding lagrangian @xmath45 we will see @xmath7 as a fixed parameter , and discuss mainly the small parameter @xmath20 . when @xmath46 , the variable @xmath32 is an integral of motion .",
    "our goal is to study its evolutions for @xmath23 .",
    "the form of the perturbation is chosen in such a way that the two - dimensional tori @xmath47 are invariant in the extended phase space , and carry a linear motion of frequency @xmath48 . by studying invariant manifolds attached to these invariant tori , arnold discovered a remarkable diffusion mechanism , now called the arnold mechanism , that we are now going to describe . in the case",
    "@xmath46 , the tori @xmath49 appear as the products of the hyperbolic fixed point @xmath50 of the pendulum in @xmath25 by the invariant torus @xmath51 of the integrable system in the @xmath52 space .",
    "they are thus partially hyperbolic , and have stable and unstable manifolds , which coincide and can be given explicitly as @xmath53 with @xmath54 the coincidence and compactness of these stable manifolds is a very special feature of the unperturbed case @xmath46 . for @xmath55 , the tori @xmath49 still have stable and unstable manifolds which can be described as follows : there exists two functions @xmath56\\lto",
    "{ \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}},\\ ] ] which converge to @xmath57 when @xmath58 , and such that the graphs @xmath59 are pieces of the stable and unstable manifolds of the torus @xmath49 .",
    "more precisely , the set @xmath60 is negatively invariant under the extended hamiltonian flow , and @xmath61 while the set @xmath62 is positively invariant under the extended hamiltonian flow , and @xmath63 the functions @xmath64 solve the hamilton - jacobi equation @xmath65 which merely says that the invariant manifolds are contained in the energy level of the torus .",
    "the functions @xmath64 have an expression in terms of the action : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is any real number such that @xmath68 , and @xmath69 is the solution of the euler - lagrange equations such that @xmath70 note that the result does not depend on the choice of @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath711/4,3/4[$ ] is a critical point of the function @xmath72 then the point @xmath73 obviously belongs both to @xmath60 and @xmath62 , hence it is a homoclinic point .",
    "it is a transversal homoclinic point if in addition the hessian of @xmath74 has rank two ( it can not have rank 3 because the intersection is necessarily one - dimensional ) .",
    "it is not obvious at this point that the function @xmath74 necessarily has critical points on the domain @xmath751/4,3/4[$ ] .",
    "when @xmath20 is small enough , this follows from :    if @xmath76 is a critical point of the function @xmath77 , then @xmath78 is a critical point of @xmath74 , hence the manifolds @xmath62 and @xmath60 intersect above @xmath79 .",
    "this homoclinic point is transversal if and only if the hessian of @xmath80 at @xmath76 is a non - degenerate @xmath81 matrix .",
    "note that the function @xmath82 is defined on @xmath83 , and therefore it has critical points .",
    "we have @xmath84 , let us denote by @xmath85 this value .",
    "we also have @xmath86 , we denote by @xmath32 this value . it is enough to prove that @xmath87 . in order to do so ,",
    "it is enough to observe that @xmath88 is the only non - negative solution of the equation @xmath89 and that precisely the same characterization is true for @xmath90 .",
    "note that the equation above has two solutions , and that we can discriminate between them because we work in a perturbative setting which gives us rough informations on the signs . in more general situation ,",
    "this is a source of difficulty .",
    "we have proved the existence of homoclinic orbits .",
    "but what is interesting for arnold diffusion are heteroclinic orbits between different tori .",
    "we can deduce the existence of a heteroclinic orbit between @xmath49 and @xmath91 provided we can find a critical point of the function @xmath921/4,3/4[\\ni ( t,\\theta , q)\\lmto s_a^{+}(t,\\theta , q)-s_{a'}^-(t,\\theta , q-1)+(a - a')\\theta,\\ ] ] where we have lifted the functions @xmath93 without changing their names .",
    "as before , we can limit ourselves to finding critical points of the function @xmath94 but the term @xmath95 prevents us from finding them using a global variational method when @xmath96 .",
    "this reflects the fact that we are studying a non exact lagrangian intersection problem . for @xmath46",
    ", heteroclinics do not exist .",
    "however , recalling that @xmath97 , we have :    [ heteroclinics ] if the function @xmath98 has a non - degenerate critical point , then the functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 both have a non - degenerate critical point provided @xmath101 is sufficiently close to @xmath102 .",
    "the theory of partial hyperbolicity implies that the stable and unstable manifolds @xmath103 depend regularly on the parameter @xmath102 . as a consequence ,",
    "their generating functions @xmath64 also regularly depend on @xmath102 , and the functions @xmath99 depend regularly on @xmath102 and @xmath101 .",
    "the result follows since @xmath104 .",
    "we say that @xmath105 is an elementary transition chain if the functions @xmath106 have non - degenerate critical points .",
    "we will sometimes use the same terminology for the different requirement that these functions have isolated local minima . from lemma [ heteroclinics ]",
    ", we deduce :    [ chain ] let @xmath20 be given and sufficiently small .",
    "let @xmath107 $ ] be an interval such that each of the functions @xmath108 $ ] have a non - degenerate critical point , which means that each of the tori @xmath109 $ ] has a transversal homoclinic orbit .",
    "then there exists an elementary transition chain @xmath110 .",
    "let us consider the set @xmath111 $ ] of points that can be reached from @xmath112 by a transition chain .",
    "the set @xmath113 is open : if @xmath114 , then there exists a transition chain @xmath115 and , by lemma [ heteroclinics ] , the sequence @xmath116 is a transition chain when @xmath117 is sufficiently close to @xmath102 .",
    "the set @xmath113 is closed : let @xmath102 be in the closure of @xmath113 . by lemma [ heteroclinics ] , the pair @xmath118 is a transition chain when @xmath101 is close to @xmath102 .",
    "since @xmath102 is in the closure of @xmath113 , the point @xmath101 can be taken in @xmath113 .",
    "then , there exists a transition chain @xmath119 , and then the longer sequence @xmath120 is a transition chain between @xmath121 and @xmath102 , hence @xmath122 .",
    "being open , closed and not empty ( it contains @xmath121 ) , the set @xmath113 is equal to @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "the existence of transition chains implies the existence of diffusion orbits .",
    "this is proved by arnold invoking an `` obstruction property '' .",
    "this obstruction property is a characteristic of the local dynamics near the partially hyperbolic tori .",
    "it has been proved by jean - pierre marco in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the most appealing way to understand the geometric shadowing of transition chains is to use the following statement of jacky cresson @xcite , which can be seen as a strong obstruction property :    [ transitivity ] if there exists a transversal heteroclinic between @xmath49 and @xmath91 and a transversal heteroclinic between @xmath91 and @xmath124 , then there exists a transversal heteroclinic between @xmath49 and @xmath124 .",
    "this lemma implies :    if @xmath125 is an elementary transition chain , then there exists a transversal heteroclinic orbit between @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "putting everything together , we obtain :    [ t1 ] let @xmath20 be given and sufficiently small .",
    "let @xmath107 $ ] be an interval such that each of the functions @xmath108 $ ] have a non - degenerate critical point .",
    "then there exists a heteroclinic orbit between @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we have constructed diffusion orbits under the assumption that transversal homoclinics exist .",
    "we have proved that homoclinic orbits necessarily exist , and one may argue that transversality should hold for typical systems , we will come back on this later . however , it is useful to be able to check whether transversality holds in a given system .",
    "a classical approach consists in proving the existence of non - degenerate critical points of the functions @xmath130 defined in lemma [ heteroclinics ] by expanding them in power series of @xmath20 . as a starting point the generating functions @xmath64 can be expanded as follows : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the generating function of the unperturbed manifolds , and @xmath133 are the so - called poincar - melnikov integrals , @xmath134 where @xmath135 . to better understand these formula , it is worth recalling that @xmath136 is the homoclinic orbit of the system @xmath137 which takes the value @xmath138 at time @xmath139 .",
    "the formula above are similar to ( [ saction ] ) , but the integration is performed on unperturbed trajectories , which are explicitly known . for @xmath1401/4,3/4[$ ] , we obtain : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the poincar - melnikov integral @xmath143 in the specific case studied by arnold , where @xmath144 , the melnikov integral can be computed explicitly through residues , we obtain : @xmath145 it has a non - degenerate minimum at @xmath146 .",
    "we can conclude , following arnold :    [ at ] let us consider the hamiltonian ( [ ae ] ) with @xmath147 and @xmath23 small enough .",
    "given two real numbers @xmath148 , there exists an orbit @xmath149 and a time @xmath150 such that @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "ugo bessi introduced in @xcite a very interesting approach to study the system ( [ ae ] ) , see also @xcite . in order to describe this approach ,",
    "let us define the function @xmath1531/4,3/4[\\times { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}\\times { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{t}}}\\times ] 1/4,3/4[\\lto { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}\\\\ & ( ( t_1,\\theta_1,q_1),(t_2,\\theta_2,q_2))\\lmto \\min \\int_{t_1}^{t_2 } l(s , \\theta(s ) , q(s),\\dot \\theta ( s ) , \\dot q(s))-a\\dot \\theta(s)+a^2/2\\,ds,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the minimum is taken on the set of @xmath154 curves @xmath155\\lto { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{t}}}\\times { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}}$ ] such that @xmath156 when the time interval @xmath157 is very large , the minimizing trajectory in the definition of @xmath158 roughly looks like the concatenation of an orbit positively asymptotic to @xmath49 followed by an orbit negatively asymptotic to @xmath49 . using this observation , and recalling the formula ( [ saction ] ) ,",
    "it is possible to prove that @xmath159 when @xmath160 .",
    "fixing the real numbers @xmath161 and the integers @xmath162 , we consider the discrete action functional @xmath163 defined on @xmath164 - 1,1[\\times ] -1,1[)^{k}$ ] .",
    "it is not hard to check that local minima of this discrete action functional give heteroclinics between the torus @xmath126 and the torus @xmath127 . in order to prove that local minima exist , observe that this functional is approximated by @xmath165 when the integers @xmath166 are large enough , with the functions @xmath167 as defined in ( [ sigma ] )",
    "this limit functional has the remarkable structure that the variables @xmath168 are separated .",
    "this break - down of the action functional into a sum of independent functions is sometimes called an anti - integrable limit , it is related to the obstruction property of the invariant tori , to the @xmath169-lemma , and to the shilnokov s lemma , see @xcite . the limit functional has an isolated local minimum provided each of the functions @xmath106 has one , which is equivalent to say that @xmath125 is an elementary transition chain . in this case , the integers @xmath166 can be chosen large enough so that the action functional above has a local minimum , which gives a heteroclinic orbit between @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "technically , this method has several advantages .",
    "in our presentation we introduced the generating functions @xmath170 of the invariant manifolds of the involved tori in order to stress the relations between the geometric and the variational method , and also because this works in a more general setting , see @xcite for example . in our context and when @xmath23 is small enough , it is easier to directly approximate the functions @xmath158 in terms of the melnikov integrals , and to use the following approximation for the action functional with large @xmath166 and small @xmath20 without the intermediate step through @xmath171 : @xmath172 the corresponding calculations , performed in @xcite , are much more elementary than those required to derive the expansions ( [ power ] ) .",
    "we have up to that point carefully avoided to discuss the subtle and important aspect of explicit estimates . in order to complete rigorously the proof of theorem [ at ] , we should prove the existence of a threshold @xmath173 such that the melnikov approximation holds , simultaneously for all @xmath102 , when @xmath174 .",
    "this can actually been done , with @xmath175 but it is not simple , since it requires to study carefully the expansions of the functions @xmath64 and how the coefficients depend on @xmath102 and @xmath176 .",
    "this is related to the so - called splitting problem , see @xcite . as we mentioned above the approach of bessi allows to prove that theorem [ at ] holds for @xmath174 without estimating the splitting .",
    "it is also important to give time estimates , that is to estimate the time needed for the variable @xmath32 to perform a large evolution . once again , this is closely related to the splitting estimates , although these can be avoided by using the method of bessi .",
    "one should distinguish two different problems .",
    "either we fix @xmath2 , and try to estimate the time as a function of @xmath20 , or we take @xmath20 as a function of @xmath2 , say @xmath177 , and try to estimate the time as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "the second problem is especially important , because it is relevant for the study of the _ a priori _ stable problem . once again , ugo bessi obtained the first estimate , @xmath178 estimating the time on examples allows to test the optimality of nekhoroshev exponents , see @xcite for works in that direction , see also @xcite concerning the question of time estimates .",
    "it is worth mentioning also that in the first problem , estimating the time as a function of @xmath20 , the estimate is polynomial , and not exponentially small .",
    "this was first understood by pierre lochak , and proved by bessi s method in @xcite , where the estimate @xmath179 is given , see also @xcite .",
    "the optimal estimate is @xmath180 , as was conjectured by lochak in @xcite and proved by berti , biasco and bolle in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "returning to the question of the threshold of validity , let us discuss what happens when @xmath20 is increased above @xmath173 .",
    "the content of section [ pm ] on finding transversal homoclinics via the poincar - melnikov approximation breaks down , but the geometric constructions of the earlier sections is still valid .",
    "theorem [ t1 ] holds as long as the invariant tori @xmath49 remain partially hyperbolic , and that their stable and unstable manifold can be represented by generating functions like ( [ s ] ) .",
    "actually , the methods we are now going to expose allow even to relax this last assumption . being able to treat larger values of @xmath20 is especially important in view of the possible applicability to the _ a priori _ stable problem .",
    "let us now discuss the following immediate generalization in higher dimensions of arnold s example : @xmath181 with @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is a non - negative function having a unique non - degenerate minimum at @xmath22 , with @xmath184 .",
    "the main difference with the example of arnold appears for @xmath185 . in this case , the system is not integrable even for @xmath46 .",
    "there still exists a family of partially hyperbolic tori of dimension @xmath186 , @xmath187 parametrized by @xmath188 , but the system @xmath189 is not necessarily integrable any more . as a consequence",
    "we do not know explicitly the stable and unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic fixed point @xmath24 , and so we do not have a perturbative setting to describe the stable and unstable manifolds of the hyperbolic tori @xmath49 .",
    "this is also what happens for @xmath190 if @xmath20 is not small enough .",
    "there is no obvious generalization of the generating functions @xmath64 in that setting , because the stable and unstable manifolds are not necessarily graphs over a prescribed domain .",
    "the proof of the existence of homoclinic orbits as given in [ hom ] thus breaks down .",
    "the existence of homoclinic orbits in that setting can still be proved by global variational methods , as is now quite well understood , see @xcite for example .",
    "the proof is quite easy in our context , let us give a rapid sketch .",
    "we first define a function @xmath158 similar to the one appearing in section [ var ] , but slightly different : @xmath191 where the minimum is taken on the set of curves @xmath155\\lto { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{t}}}^m\\times { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{t}}}^r$ ] such that @xmath192 for @xmath193 or @xmath194 .",

    "this limit curve satisfies @xmath210 and the corresponding orbit is a heteroclinic from @xmath211 to @xmath212 .",
    "we call minimizing heteroclinics ( for the lifted system ) those which have minimal action , or in other words those which satisfy ( [ xi ] ) . in the original system ( before taking the covering ) , we call minimizing homoclinic orbit a homoclinic which lifts to a minimizing heteroclinic .",
    "let us now try to establish some connections between the present discussion and the proof of the existence of homoclinic orbits given in [ hom ] .",
    "we define two functions on @xmath202 : @xmath213 note that @xmath214 the functions @xmath215 , whose definition is basic both in mather s ( @xcite ) and in fathi s ( @xcite ) theory , share many features with those introduced in ( [ s ] ) , that s why we use the same name .",
    "let us state some of their properties :    the function @xmath216 is non - positive and it vanishes on @xmath217 ( and only there ) .",

    "@xmath215 ( which is one of the central aspects of fathi s weak kam theory , see @xcite ) , this idea can be made rigorous as follows :    if @xmath226 is a local minimum of the function @xmath240 , then both @xmath221 and @xmath216 are differentiable at the point @xmath237 , we have @xmath241 and the orbit of this point is either a heteroclinic between @xmath211 and @xmath212 or a homoclinic to @xmath211 or to @xmath212 in the system lifted to the covering , and thus it projects to an orbit homoclinic to @xmath49 in the original system .",
    "although it is not obvious _ a priori _ that a local minimum of the function @xmath240 exists away from @xmath242 and @xmath243 , this follows from the existence of minimizing heteroclinics , that we already proved .",

    "the point @xmath237 is a global minimum of @xmath239 if and only if either @xmath245 or the orbit of the point @xmath246 is a minimizing heteroclinic between @xmath211 and @xmath212 . *",
    "the set of minima of the function @xmath239 properly contains @xmath247 .    as a consequence ,",
    "the trajectory @xmath248 is a minimizing heteroclinic if and only if @xmath249 for each @xmath250 ( and if @xmath251 is not identically @xmath252 or @xmath253 ) .",
    "this minimizing heteroclinic is called isolated if , for some @xmath250 , the point @xmath254 is an isolated minimum of the function @xmath255    now we have proved that the stable and unstable manifolds of the torus @xmath49 necessarily intersect , let us suppose that there exists a compact and connected set @xmath256 such that the intersection is transversal for @xmath122 . by a continuity argument as in proposition [ chain ] , we conclude that any two points @xmath112 and @xmath257 in @xmath113 can be connected by a transition chain , that is a sequence @xmath258 such that the unstable manifold of @xmath259 transversally intersects the stable manifold of @xmath260 .",
    "we would like to deduce the existence of a transversal heteroclinic orbit between @xmath128 and @xmath129 , but i do not know whether the higher codimensional analog of cresson s transitivity lemma [ transitivity ] holds .",
    "however , the weaker obstruction property proved in @xcite is enough to imply the existence of orbits connecting any neighborhood of @xmath128 to any neighborhood of @xmath129 .",
    "it is also possible to build shadowing orbits using a variational approach .",
    "we need the slightly different assumption that @xmath256 is a compact connected set such that , for all @xmath122 , all the minimizing homoclinics of @xmath49 are isolated . for each @xmath112 and @xmath257 in @xmath113",
    ", it is then possible to construct by a variational method similar to section [ var ] a heteroclinic orbit between @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "a very specific feature of all the examples studied so far is that the perturbation preserves the partially hyperbolic invariant tori @xmath261 .",
    "we now discuss the general _ a priori _ unstable system ( [ unstable ] ) .",
    "let us assume that @xmath190 and try to apply the method of section [ arnold ] .",
    "there is no explicit invariant torus any more , but kam methods can be applied to prove the existence of many partially hyperbolic tori .",
    "more precisely , there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath262 close to the identity , such that an invariant quasiperiodic torus @xmath263 of frequency @xmath264 exists , and is close to @xmath49 , provided the frequency @xmath264 satisfies some diophantine condition .",
    "moreover , for such values of @xmath102 , the local stable and unstable manifolds @xmath103 can be generated by functions @xmath265\\lto",
    "{ \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{r}}},\\ ] ] as earlier .",
    "so we have exactly the same picture as in section [ arnold ] , except that the objects are defined only on a subset @xmath266 of parameters . in order to reproduce the mechanism of section [ arnold ] , we must find elementary transitions chains @xmath267 in @xmath268 , with the additional requirement that @xmath269 .",
    "it is necessary at this point to describe a bit more the set @xmath270 .",
    "roughly , the kam methods allow to prove the existence of the torus @xmath263 provided @xmath102 belongs to @xmath271 for some constant @xmath272 .",
    "this set @xmath270 is totally disconnected , hence it is not possible to apply a continuity method like in proposition [ chain ] in order to prove the existence of a transition chain . we must be more quantitative , which is possible when @xmath20 is so small that the poincar - melnikov approximation is valid .",
    "in that regime , we have @xmath273 , where @xmath142 has a non - degenerate critical point .",
    "the conclusion of lemma [ heteroclinics ] can then be proved to hold under the more explicit condition that @xmath274 . in other words ,",
    "the sequence @xmath125 is an elementary transition chain if @xmath275 .",
    "however , the gaps in @xmath270 have a width of size @xmath276 . as a consequence , for small @xmath20",
    ", it seems impossible to build long transition chains , and the method fails .",
    "this is the large gap problem , see @xcite .",
    "even if there are classes of examples where the method can be applied because more tori exist in some regions of phase space , see @xcite for example , the generic case seems out of range .",
    "the large gap problem has now been solved , at least in the case where @xmath26 , see @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss and compare all these solutions here , but just expose some general ideas which arise from them .",
    "an important new point of view is to focus on the whole cylinder @xmath277 rather than on each of the tori @xmath49 individually .",
    "this cylinder is normally hyperbolic in the sense of @xcite , and thus it is preserved in the perturbed system .",
    "this new point of view is very natural , it appears in @xcite , and then in many other papers .",
    "the deformed cylinder @xmath278 contains all the preserved tori @xmath263 obtained by kam theory .",
    "the restricted dynamics is described by an _ a priori _ stable system on @xmath279 . if @xmath27 , we are confronted to our lack of understanding of the _ a priori _ stable situation . if @xmath26 , however , the restricted system is the suspension of an area preserving twist map , and we can exploit the good understanding of these systems given by birkhoff theory which has also been interpreted ( and extended ) variationally in the works of mather @xcite .",
    "we consider this case ( @xmath26 ) from now on .",
    "the invariant @xmath194-tori which are graphs are of particular importance ( they correspond to rotational invariant circles of the time - one map ) . to each of these invariant graphs",
    ", we can associate two real numbers , the rotation number @xmath280 ( defined from poincar theory of circle homeomorphisms ) , and the area @xmath102 , which is the symplectic area of the domain of the cylinder @xmath281 delimited by the zero section and by the invariant graph under consideration .",
    "if a given invariant graph @xmath282 of the restricted dynamics has irrational rotation number ( or is completely periodic ) , then there is no other invariant graph with the same area @xmath102 .",
    "we can take a two - covering and associate to this graph two functions @xmath215 by formula similar to ( [ sa ] ) .",
    "they generate the local stable and unstable manifold of the torus @xmath282 , the correspond to the global minima of the difference of the so - called barrier function @xmath239 .",
    "minimal homoclinics and isolated minimal homoclinics to @xmath282 can be defined as in section [ hd ] .",
    "the existence of minimal homoclinics can be proved basically in the same way as it was there .",
    "an invariant graph is called a _ transition torus _ if it has irrational rotation number ( or if it is foliated by periodic orbits ) , and if all its minimal homoclinic orbits are isolated .",
    "transition tori can be used to build transition chains in the same way as partially hyperbolic quasiperiodic tori with transversal homoclinics .",
    "let @xmath283 be the set of areas of transition tori . to each @xmath122",
    "is attached a unique transition torus @xmath263 ( note that this torus may be only lipschitz , and is not necessarily quasiperiodic ) .",
    "if @xmath113 contains an interval @xmath123 $ ] , then the existence of a heteroclinic orbit between @xmath284 and @xmath285 can be proved by already exposed methods ( considering the way we have chosen our definitions , a variational method should be used , but a parallel geometric theory could certainly be given ) .    in general , the set @xmath113 is totally disconnected , and transition chains ca nt be obtained by a simple continuity method . if we make the additional hypothesis that all invariant graphs of the restricted dynamics are transition tori , then the set @xmath113 is closed and a connected component @xmath286a^-,a^+[$ ] of its complement corresponds to a `` region of instability '' of the restricted system in the terminology of birkhoff .",
    "more precisely , the tori @xmath284 and @xmath285 enclose a cylinder which does not contain any invariant graph . the theory of birkhoff",
    "then implies that there exist orbits of the restricted dynamics connecting an arbitrarily small neighborhood of @xmath284 to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of @xmath285 .",
    "this gives an indication about how to solve the large gap problem : use the birkhoff orbits to cross regions of instability , and the arnold homoclinic mechanism to cross transition circles .",
    "it is by no means obvious to prove the existence of actual orbits shadowing that kind of structure . in order to do so",
    ", one should first put these mechanisms into a common framework .",
    "the variational framework seems appropriate , although a geometric approach is also possible .",
    "the birkhoff theory was described and extended using variational methods by mather in @xcite , and he proposed a new variational formalism adapted to higher dimensional situations in @xcite . on the other hand , bessi s method indicates how to put arnold s mechanism into a variational framework .",
    "these heuristics lead to :    [ ba ] let @xmath123 $ ] be a given interval .",
    "if all the invariant graphs of area @xmath287 $ ] of the restricted dynamics are transition tori , then there exists an orbit @xmath288 and a time @xmath150 such that @xmath289 and @xmath290 .",
    "this theorem is proved using variational methods and weak kam theory in @xcite , section 11 , where it is deduced from more general abstract results .",
    "it also almost follows from @xcite , theorem 5.1 , which is another general abstract result proved by elaborations on mather s variational methods @xcite , see also @xcite . applying that result of cheng and yan , however ,",
    "would require a minor additional generic hypothesis on the restricted dynamics .",
    "in the case where @xmath190 , a slightly weaker version of theorem [ ba ] could also be deduced from the earlier paper of chen and yan @xcite . under different sets of hypotheses , results in the same spirit",
    "have been obtained by geometric methods in @xcite . at the moment",
    ", these methods do not reach statements as general as theorem [ ba ] , but they apply in contexts where the variational methods ca nt be used .",
    "the following variant of theorem [ ba ] may deserve attention in connection to the arnold mechanism : assume that @xmath112 and @xmath257 belong to @xmath113 , or in other words that there exist transition tori @xmath291 .",
    "these tori enclose a compact invariant piece @xmath292 $ ] of the invariant cylinder .",
    "if all the invariant graphs contained in @xmath292 $ ] are transition tori , then we say that @xmath292 $ ] is a transition channel .",
    "the proof of theorem [ ba ] also implies that , if @xmath292 $ ] is a transition channel , then there exists a heteroclinic orbit connecting @xmath293 to @xmath294 .",
    "theorem [ ba ] proves the existence of diffusion under `` explicit '' conditions .",
    "these conditions are hard to check on a given system , but they seem to hold for typical systems .",
    "it is much harder than one may expect to prove a precise statement in that direction , but it was achieved by cheng and yan in @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty comes from the condition on the isolated minimal homoclinics . actually , it is not hard to prove that the homoclinics to a given torus are isolated for a typical perturbation , but we need the condition to hold for all the tori simultaneously .",
    "since there are uncountably many tori , it is necessary to understand the regularity of the map @xmath295 .",
    "recall that the functions @xmath64 are well - defined provided there exists an invariant graph of area @xmath102 which has irrational rotation number or is foliated by periodic orbits .",
    "we call @xmath296 this set of areas , it contains @xmath113 .",
    "cheng and yan prove that the map @xmath297 is hlder continuous on @xmath296 , and deduce the genericity result using an unpublished idea of john mather .",
    "the main objects in arnold s mechanism are partially hyperbolic tori , that he called whiskered tori .",
    "it was proved by treshchev @xcite , that whiskered tori exist in the _ a priori _ stable situation , see also @xcite . however , because of the large gap problem , it seems difficult to prove directly the existence of transition chains made of whiskered tori .",
    "actually , small transition chains do exist , because the density of kam tori increases near a given one , but the length of these chains gets small when @xmath2 gets small , hence these chains do not produce instability of the action variables in general .",
    "the modern paradigm on the _ a priori _ unstable case that we exposed in section [ basec ] elects 3-dimensional normally hyperbolic invariant cylinders as the important structure .",
    "it is well - known that normally hyperbolic invariant cylinders exist in the _ a priori _ stable case .",
    "for example , each @xmath194-dimensional whiskered torus has a center manifold , which is a @xmath298-dimensional normally hyperbolic invariant cylinder , see _ _ e .",
    "g.__@xcite . actually , it is simpler to prove directly the existence of normally hyperbolic invariant cylinders , this involves no small divisors .",
    "however , the most direct proofs seem to produce `` small '' normally hyperbolic cylinders , which means that their size is getting small with @xmath2 , so that we face the same problem as above when we had small transition chains .",
    "the main statement of @xcite is that `` large '' normally hyperbolic cylinders exist , meaning that their size is bounded from below independently of @xmath2 .    in order to be more specific ,",
    "let us select a resonant momentum of the form @xmath299 , with @xmath9 diophantine .",
    "assuming that the corresponding averaged potential @xmath21 has a unique minimum and that this minimum is non - degenerate , we have :      there exists a @xmath154 map @xmath302 such that the flow is tangent to the graph @xmath303 of @xmath304 .",
    "moreover , there exist two real numbers @xmath305 and @xmath306 in @xmath307 ( which depend on @xmath2 ) such that the treshchev tori @xmath126 and @xmath308 exist and are contained in @xmath303 .",
    "the part @xmath309 of @xmath303 delimited by these two tori is then a compact invariant manifold with boundary of the flow , it is normally hyperbolic .",
    "it is equivalent to say that it is partially hyperbolic with a central distribution equal to the tangent space of @xmath303 .",
    "the inner dynamics is the suspension of an area - preserving twist map ( where the area is the one induced from the ambient symplectic form ) .",
    "it is then reasonable to expect that , under generic additional hypotheses , @xmath309 is a transition channel as defined in section [ basec ] , and thus that @xmath126 and @xmath308 are connected by a heteroclinic orbit .",
    "we are currently exploring that program in collaboration with vadim kaloshin and ke zhang .",
    "it is important to observe that the map @xmath304 is not @xmath154-close to @xmath24 , and that the inner dynamics is not close to integrable .",
