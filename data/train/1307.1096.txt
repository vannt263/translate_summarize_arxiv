    "the observation of a new boson at a mass of 125  gev reported by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations maintains the motivation to continue analyzing richer content in the scalar sector .",
    "an interesting proposal arises when one or more scalar fields are added to the scalar sector of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "one of the simplest and interesting proposals adds an additional doublet scalar field , named as two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) . as a result ,",
    "new charged higgs bosons are predicted which could give a sign of physics beyond the sm .",
    "this charged higgs boson has been searched by aleph , delphi , l3 and opal collaborations in charged higgs boson pair - production processes  @xcite .",
    "their results have excluded values for charged higgs boson mass below @xmath2  gev or @xmath3  gev at 95  % c.l . when the results are interpreted within 2hdm type i or type ii , respectively .",
    "the latest experimental searches for channels @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been carried out by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite . the cms collaboration reports upper limits on the branching fraction @xmath6 in the range of 2 - 4  % for charged higgs boson masses between 80 gev and 160 gev  @xcite . moreover , atlas collaboration excluded the mixing angle @xmath7 of the charged scalar in the region @xmath8 for charged higgs boson masses between 90  gev and 150  gev in the mssm benchmark scenario .",
    "other possible sources that could give clues to the existence of charged higgs boson are the electron and neutrino scattering processes .",
    "the scattering among electrons and neutrinos plays an important role in particle physics since it is a purely leptonic process .",
    "as is well known , the weinberg angle @xmath9 and the fermi constant @xmath10 are measured with high precision in these leptonic weak interactions .",
    "based on the sm , the only contributions for the @xmath11 or @xmath12 scattering are given by the @xmath13 or @xmath14 gauge bosons , which means purely weak interactions .",
    "the higgs boson could participate at tree level if the neutrinos are considered with masses but its contribution is proportional to the neutrino masses which is neglected .",
    "however a charged higgs boson contribution to the process could be considered without the neutrino masses assumption .    beyond the sm framework ,",
    "non standard interactions ( nsi ) have been considered with vector , axial or tensor structure to electron neutrino scattering processes  @xcite . under this framework ,",
    "the scalar or pseudoscalar structure has not been considered because its contribution is smaller .",
    "however , some authors give a phenomenological study with the possibility of scalar or pseudoscalar covariant neutral current interactions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are focused on a general analysis of scalar and pseudoscalar interactions that contribute to the ( anti)neutrino - electron scattering processes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the general formalism for the scalar - pseudoscalar interactions and derive the differential cross section for ( anti)neutrino - electron scattering processes . in section iii",
    "we discuss briefly the experimental data that we will use to obtain our constraints .",
    "finally , in section iv we will show the numerical results for the general formalism and we will discuss the case of the 2hdm - type iii .",
    "in order to have a model independent scalar - pseudoscalar interaction among leptons and charged higgs bosons , we consider the effective lagrangian @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a general operator with scalar and pseudoscalar interactions and @xmath17 .",
    "we will see in section  [ sec-3 ] that this expression will be useful for some extensions of the standard model .    with this effective lagrangian",
    ", the amplitude for the @xmath18 elastic scattering is given by the sum @xmath19 with @xmath20 the usual amplitude of the standard model and @xmath21 the new scalar - pseudoscalar contribution that , assuming a low energy regime , is given by @xmath22 it is important to note that the two interference terms @xmath23 and @xmath24 contained in @xmath25 give an important contribution to the result . in order to calculate these terms it is useful to make a fierz reordering , using known techniques  @xcite . for the case of the operator @xmath26 , it is possible to find the general transformation @xmath27 where @xmath28 are constants and @xmath29 the usual chiral projectors @xmath30 .",
    "averaging over initial spin and summing over final spin , we have @xmath31 \\left ( 1-y\\right ) ^{2}\\right . \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left .",
    "\\left ( g_{a}+g_{v}\\right ) ^{2}-\\left [ \\left ( g_{v}^{2}-g_{a}^{2}\\right ) + \\left ( g_{v}+g_{a}\\right ) \\textrm{re}% \\left ( g^{\\alpha,\\beta}_{s}-g^{\\alpha,\\beta}_{p}\\right ) \\right ] \\frac{m_{e}y}{e_{\\nu}}% \\right\\ }    \\label{mp_f},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath32 are the standard model values for the vector and axial coupling constants , shown explicitly in table  [ table1 ] , and @xmath33 , for @xmath34 and @xmath35 the neutrino final and initial energies , respectively . with the help of previous formula",
    "it can be easily obtained that the neutrino - electron elastic cross section is @xmath36 \\left ( 1-\\frac{t}{e_{\\nu}}% \\right ) ^{2}\\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left . -\\left [ g_{l}g_{r}+\\frac{1}{2}g_{l}\\textrm{re}\\left ( g^{\\alpha,\\beta}_{s}-g^{\\alpha,\\beta}_{p}\\right ) \\right ] \\frac{m_{e}t}{e_{\\nu}^{2}}\\right\\ } , \\label{se_vl - e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the electron recoil kinetic energy and @xmath38 .",
    "analogously , the antineutrino - electron elastic cross section can be obtained to be @xmath39 + g_{l}^{2}\\left ( 1-\\frac{t}{% e_{\\nu}}\\right ) ^{2}\\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left . -\\left [ g_{l}g_{r}+\\frac{1}{2}g_{l}\\textrm{re}\\left ( g^{\\alpha,\\beta}_{s}-g^{\\alpha,\\beta}_{p}\\right ) \\right ] \\frac{m_{e}t}{e_{\\nu}^{2}}\\right\\}. \\label{se_antiv - e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following we will study the dimensionless parameters @xmath40 in muon and electron ( anti)neutrino scattering . in general this parameters can be different in each case .       from the comparison of these constraints with the analytic expressions shown in table [ g_sp2hdm ]",
    ", we can conclude that a constraint of @xmath43 at 90  % c.l .",
    "is reached when we consider a charged higgs mass of @xmath44  gev  @xcite and @xmath45 while @xmath46 at 90  % c.l .",
    ", for the same values of the higgs mass and @xmath47 .",
    "these constraints are stronger than those coming from lepton flavor violation in the charged leptonic sector  @xcite where the following restrictions have been found @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we can conclude then that , since we are dealing with tree level processes , we have been able to obtain a stronger bound .",
    "moreover , the scattering that we are studying is a two body process where the contribution to new physics is only through charged current and , therefore there are less parameters involved in the process ( there is no dependence on @xmath50 for example ) and therefore the constraint is in some sense more robust",
    ".    it may also be interesting to obtain similar constraints for different textures of the mixing matrix since in this case constraints could be more restrictive depending on the specific texture under study  @xcite .",
