    "randomness in the chemical composition or due to defects in solids causes elastic scatterings of charge carriers that influence significantly their motion and reduce their mobility . to describe the effects of randomly distributed scatterers reliably",
    "one has to use approximations taking satisfactorily into account quantum coherence between scattering events .",
    "in particular , self - consistence between one and two - particle functions is needed if we want to assess the role of backscatterings and the backflow on transport properties of electrons in a random potential .",
    "a simplest possibility to account for quantum coherence is to sum all multiple scatterings on a single scatterer .",
    "a self - consistent theory with all single - site scatterings is the coherent - potential approximation ( cpa ) and was developed in the end of sixties.@xcite it is a mean - field approximation for disordered ( noninteracting ) electrons .",
    "it provides a local coherent potential ( self - energy ) that , in the thermodynamic limit , comprises the effects of the random potential on the motion of the single electron .",
    "the cpa , as other mean - field theories , however , suppresses spatial coherence between distinct scattering centers and the moving electrons feel the influence of the random potential only via an averaged medium .",
    "cpa has proven very successful in the description of one - electron properties at the model level as well as in realistic calculations of random alloys.@xcite although this approximation can as well describe two - particle averaged functions , due to the lack of spatial coherence , it fails to capture backscattering effects on the transport coefficients and the electrical conductivity .",
    "the two - particle cpa vertex does not depend on the transfer momentum between the incoming and the outgoing particles and hence the cpa conductivity reduces in the single - band bulk systems to a contribution from a single particle - hole bubble .",
    "there are no vertex corrections to the electrical conductivity within the standard cpa.@xcite    vertex corrections to the single - bubble one - electron conductivity are important in various situations . in low dimensions ( @xmath1 ) or for sufficiently strong disorder",
    "they lead to anderson localization.@xcite further on , tunnel conductance or transport through multilayered dirty metals are essentially influenced by vertex corrections.@xcite to obtain more realistic results for the electronic transport in dirty metals one has to go beyond the standard cpa to the conductivity and develop approximations containing spatial quantum coherence and backscattering contributions .",
    "there is a long history of efforts to improve upon the mean - field cpa description of disordered electrons @xcite .",
    "most of them concentrate on single - particle properties and improve upon the cpa in the self - energy ( coherent potential ) .",
    "a natural extension of the single - site theory is to use clusters self - consistently embedded in an averaged medium .",
    "however , apart from the traveling - cluster approximation,@xcite extensions in the lattice space fail to warrant global analytic properties of the solution and hence spurious effects can emerge.@xcite only recently a cluster expansion in momentum space was suggested that warrants analytic ( herglotz ) properties of the resulting averaged propagators and the self - energy at each stage.@xcite cluster approximations with self - energy diagrams improve also two - particle vertex functions . however , cluster approximations reduce spatial quantum coherence only to a discrete set of lattice sites or momenta",
    ". such approximations then remain perturbative in the coherence range and can not lead to anderson localization to which we need long - range coherence with infinite - many backscattering or `` crossed '' diagrams.@xcite    using cluster approximations to improve upon the mean - field transport properties means that we have first to extend the one - electron calculation scheme .",
    "a tremendous effort at the one - particle level is to be exerted to obtain significant changes in transport properties .",
    "cluster expansions are hence not very effective in calculating quantum coherence effects in the electrical conductivity .",
    "it is more efficient to develop approximations directly for two - particle functions .",
    "a suitable framework for developing two - particle approximations is a parquet approach devised within quantum many - body theory.@xcite it is an advanced scheme of summation of feynman ( many - body ) diagrams based on renormalizations of two - particle vertex functions .",
    "its main idea is to utilize ambiguity in the definition of the two - particle irreducibility .",
    "each two - particle irreducibility , i.  e. , the way how pairs of one - particle propagators are cut without disconnecting the diagram , defines a scattering channel and a bethe - salpeter equation for the full two - particle vertex . since different two - particle channels are topologically inequivalent",
    ", a solution of the bethe - salpeter equation from one channel ( reducible function ) is irreducible in the other channels where it is used in the input ( integral kernel ) in the respective bethe - salpeter equations .",
    "thereby a set of coupled , nonlinear self - consistent equations for the two - particle irreducible vertices ( parquet equations ) is obtained .",
    "parquet equations have been applied onto various many - body problems , but no significant attempt has been made to use the parquet - type renormalization of feynman diagrams in disordered systems .    in this paper",
    "we develop a parquet approach to systems with noninteracting electrons subjected to a random potential .",
    "we show how to construct controlled approximations directly for the two - particle vertex using the idea of parquet diagrams .",
    "since the parquet construction applies only to nonlocal propagators , we start from the limit of high spatial dimensions where the diagonal and off - diagonal one - particle propagators separate and the cpa becomes exact.@xcite beyond this limit we construct parquet equations for two - particle irreducible vertices from bethe - salpeter equations with a perturbed nonlocal one - particle propagator and the local two - particle vertex as input .",
    "next we use a ward identity to determine the self - energy and the full one - particle averaged propagator from the calculated vertex functions .",
    "this self - consistent procedure warrants conservation laws and analytic properties of the one - particle functions whenever the solutions to the two - particle parquet equations are analytic .",
    "the unrestricted system of parquet equations is not soluble in general .",
    "we hence resort to high spatial dimensions where the two - particle self - consistence is naturally suppressed and one obtains the asymptotic form of the two - particle vertex in closed form.@xcite we use this explicit result to derive a mean - field approximation for the electrical conductivity containing vertex corrections .",
    "we then choose a binary alloy to make quantitative assessments of the impact of vertex corrections on the bulk conductivity .",
