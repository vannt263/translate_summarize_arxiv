    "the unknown transverse velocity of m31 relative to the milky way introduces an ambiguity into the dynamical history of the local group and the likely dark - matter mass of its components @xcite .",
    "the system potentially provides a local example for the dynamics that leads more generally to the formation of elliptical galaxies out of the merger of two disks @xcite .",
    "the estimated ages of stars within the disks of the milky way and andromeda imply that these disks formed @xmath3 billion years ago , and their small scale height suggests that they had not experienced any substantial merger activity since then @xcite .",
    "recent vlba observations of two h@xmath4o masers on opposite sides of andromeda s satellite , m33 , led to a geometric determination of its distance @xmath5 kpc and total velocity of @xmath6 relative to the milky way @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no such masers were found in andromeda , despite extensive search efforts ( e.g. imai et al .",
    "m33 has a thin /stellar disk that extends out to a radius of @xmath3 kpc @xcite .",
    "here we use the existence of this disk and its measured position and bulk velocity in three - dimensions , to constrain the transverse velocity of andromeda .",
    "in particular , we use the constraints that : _",
    "m33 s stellar disk was not disrupted by tidal interactions with the milky way and andromeda over the past 10 billion years ; and _ ( ii ) _ these galaxies were closer to each other more than 10 billion years ago as participants in the expansion of the universe . in ",
    "2 we describe our prescription for the mass profiles of the galaxy halos under consideration and in  3 we present our numerical results . finally ,  4 summarizes our main conclusions .",
    "we would like to constrain the velocity vector of m31 based on the condition that the stellar disk of m33 ( as represented by test particles on circular orbits at radii @xmath7 kpc from the center of m33 ) was not disrupted during the past @xmath3 billion years . for simplicity , we assume a spherical distribution of enclosed mass , @xmath8 , within each of the galaxy halos under consideration ( m31 , m33 , and the milky way ) and follow orbits of test particles in them . in order to solve for the orbits of these test particles we only need to specify the gravitational acceleration as a function of radial distance @xmath9 from the center of these halos , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the circular velocity as function of radius within these halos .",
    "our test - particle approach ignores the effect of dynamical friction on the orbit of m33 inside the halo of m31 .",
    "the additional effect of dynamical friction can only strengthen our constraints since it would bring m33 closer to the core of m31 , where it would be more vulnerable to tidal disruption .",
    "hence , our simple test - particle approach provides conservative constraints on the allowed range of possible orbits for the m33/m31 system . for an elaborate discussion on the impact of dynamical friction on the survival of satellite halos ,",
    "see taffoni et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and references therein .",
    "the simplest model of galaxy halos assumes a flat rotation curve , @xmath13 , out to a truncation radius @xmath14 .",
    "since all three galaxies under consideration have disks , the values of @xmath15 can be inferred from their corresponding kinematic data , namely @xmath16 , 220 , and 250  @xmath17 for m33 , the milky way , and m31 , respectively .",
    "the truncation radius is related to the total mass of the halo , @xmath18 , through the expression @xmath19 . for m33 , @xmath14 is dictated by the tidal effect of m31 . given an orbit of m33 , we find @xmath14 for m33 by searching for the largest radius at which a test particle initially on a circular orbit around m33 would remain bound to it .    for m31 and the milky way ,",
    "it is natural to associate @xmath14 with the virial radius , @xmath20 , inside of which the mean halo density is @xmath21 times larger than the mean density of the universe when these galaxies formed .",
    "more precisely , in a flat universe with density parameters @xmath22 in matter and @xmath23 in a cosmological constant , the density of the halo in units of the critical density at the collapse redshift @xmath24 of the halo is ( see  2.3 in barkana & loeb 2001 for more details ) , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 a halo of virial mass @xmath28 that formed at a redshift @xmath24 has a physical virial radius of @xmath29^{-1/3 } \\left({1+z\\over 2}\\right)^{-1 } h^{-1}~{\\rm kpc } , \\label{eq : r_v}\\ ] ] and a corresponding circular velocity at the virial radius , @xmath30^{1/6}\\left({1+z\\over 2}\\right)^{1/2}~{\\rm km~s^{-1}}~. \\label{eq : v_v}\\ ] ] here @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the present - day value of the hubble constant in units of @xmath33 , and @xmath34 $ ] . our choice for the virialization redshift of m31 , m33 , and the milky way is @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "nuclear dating of the thin galactic disk implies an age of @xmath36 gyr corresponding to a formation redshift @xmath37 ( peloso et al . 2005 ) , as expected from other considerations for spiral galaxies ( hammer et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the total halo masses of the milky way and m31 were also constrained directly in the literature @xcite .",
    "we parametrize the masses of m31 and the milky way in units of @xmath38 and @xmath39  respectively , and adopt the wmap values for the cosmological parameters , namely @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "to refine our constraints , we adopt a halo profile that follows from cosmological simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 ; hereafter nfw ) found an analytic fit to results from their cosmological n - body simulations of galaxy halos in a cold dark matter cosmology .",
    "the density profile in their model has an asymptotic radial dependence of @xmath43 at large distances and @xmath44 at small distances .",
    "the model has two free parameters : one is the transition radius that separates these different power - law dependencies , @xmath45 , and the second is the so - called `` concentration parameter '' , @xmath46 , which denotes the ratio between the virial radius @xmath20 and @xmath45 .",
    "the radial gravitational acceleration in the nfw model is given by @xmath47}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 with @xmath20 given by equation ( [ eq : r_v ] ) .",
    "the present - day concentration parameter is correlated with the halo collapse redshift ( wechsler et al .",
    "our goal is to examine a wide range of trial proper motions for m31 , compute the history of the m33/m31/milky way system , and determine which proper motions lead to the survival of m33 s stellar disk .",
    "our numerical simulations used s. aarseth s nbody0 code , modified to allow the extended dark - matter potentials associated with the galaxies . m31 and the milky way were treated as extended rigid bodies while the disk and halo of m33 were modelled as a collection of test particles moving in the combined , time - dependent potential of m31 , the milky way , and m33 .",
    "we used a galactic cartesian coordinate system in which the milky way is in the @xmath49 plane , with the galactic center at @xmath50  kpc , @xmath51 is toward galactic rotation , and @xmath24 is toward the north galactic pole .",
    "the calculations were initialized to match today s positions and motions of m33 , m31 , and the milky way .",
    "while we have a measured proper motion for m33 , none exist for m31 .",
    "therefore , we assigned trial values for the proper motion for m31 in the eastward ( @xmath52 ) and northward ( @xmath53 ) directions and then converted them to the galactic cartesian frame . the observed radial velocity of m31 relative to the center of the milky way is @xmath54  , which converted to the galactic cartesian frame yields @xmath55  .",
    "the radial and trial proper motions were combined to give the full velocity vector of m31 at the present epoch . for the distances of m31 and m33 from the milky way we adopt the respective values of 786 kpc and 794 kpc @xcite .",
    "m31 and the milky way were assigned total masses of @xmath56 and @xmath57  and truncation radii @xmath14 of @xmath58 and @xmath59 kpc respectively ( consistently with their measured rotation curves for the isothermal sphere model ) .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath60 was used to test the sensitivity of our results to the total dark matter masses ( for recent empirical constraints , see battaglia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the dark matter distributions of m31 and the milky way were assigned an nfw halo mass profile with a concentration parameter @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "our results are not sensitive to reasonable variations in @xmath46 .",
    "we also tested the truncated singular isothermal sphere as an alternative dark matter mass distribution and found that it produced similar , albeit slightly greater , tidal stripping and heating of m33 .",
    "the stellar disk of m33 at 10 or 5 gyr ago was simulated with typically 100 collisionless particles uniformly placed between 2.5 and 7.5 kpc of the center of m33 in the @xmath49 plane .",
    "the outer cutoff simulates approximately the maximum extent of the stellar disk in m33 @xcite .",
    "the inner cutoff was adopted for computational speed ; since tidal heating and stripping starts from the outside and proceeds inward , the fate of test stars near the center of m33 is of little interest for our purposes .",
    "since strong tidal stripping and heating of m33 s halo is also a possibility , the dark matter distribution of m33 was monitored by placing roughly 100 `` mass - tracing '' particles at 1 kpc spacings out to the truncation radius of the galaxy .",
    "the enclosed mass profile for m33 was updated every @xmath62 yr from the locations of the mass - tracing particles , azimuthally averaged and binned as a function of radius from the center of m33 . as these mass - tracing particles interacted with m31 and the milky way , some were tidally stripped , steepening the fall - off of mass with radius in m33 .",
    "the halo stripping and heating of m33 did not affect significantly its orbit ( because of its low mass ) but had some effect on the tidal disruption of its stellar disk .",
    "we therefore started the calculation by integrating the coordinates of the three galaxies backwards in time to obtain initial conditions either 10 or 5 gyr ago .",
    "this was implemented by reversing the sign of today s velocity vector for each galaxy . with the entire system specified in the past ,",
    "the calculation proceeded forward in time to the present epoch and included the stripping and heating of m33 s dark halo and stellar disk .",
    "once the local group arrived at the present time , we displayed the locations of the `` disk '' stars in m33 , as illustrated in figure  1 . in some trials",
    ", the disk stars remained in orbit about the center of m33 with little change in radial distribution or the original orbital plane , indicating little tidal stripping and heating .",
    "in other trials , many stars were moved to much greater radii , the mean orbital plane was rotated and warped , and the distribution was more triaxial than planar , indicating strong tidal heating after a few passages near m31 or the milky way .    in order to evaluate quantitatively the degree of tidal stripping and heating",
    ", we produced a simple estimate of the percentage of stars `` stripped '' from m33 .",
    "stars moved to radii greater than 8 kpc or out of the initial stellar plane by more than 20% of their radial distance , were considered stripped .",
    "we determined the stellar plane in an approximate manner , by fitting straight lines to the projected distributions in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 planes , rotating the system back to the @xmath49 plane , and calculating each star s distance from this plane ( @xmath65distance ) .",
    "in general , three euler angles are needed to correct the rotation of a system . however , for small tidal rotations of the stellar plane , our procedure is adequate since we start with the stars in a plane aligned with the cartesian axes . for large rotations ( @xmath66 ) , we optimized this procedure by considering a @xmath67 grid of rotation angles spaced by @xmath68 and centered on the initial results ; for each test we calculated the percentage of stripped stars and adopted the rotations that produced the minimum stripping .",
    "figure 2 displays the percentage of stars in m33 that were tidally stripped over a wide range of trial proper motions for m31 .",
    "for the galaxy masses listed above and a lookback time of 10 gyr , large areas of proper - motion space for m31 result in significant ( @xmath69% ) tidal stripping of m33 s stellar disk , including most proper motions smaller than @xmath70  .",
    "we repeated our calculations for two lookback times ( 5 or 10 gyr ) and for two estimates of total galaxy masses ( given by @xmath60 of 1.0 and 0.75 ) .",
    "reducing either the lookback time or the masses of the galaxies reduces the stripping , although significant stripping and heating still occurs over large areas of proper - motion space for m31 .",
    "since the real m33 does not appear to have undergone significant tidal heating , the darkly shaded areas in figure 2 would seem to be ruled out as possible proper motions for m31 .",
    "we tested the sensitivity of our conclusions to uncertainties in m33 s proper motion , the relative distances of m31 and m33 , and the initial orientation of the stellar disk in m33 . in one test , shifting the motion of m33 by 70  ( randomly in the three cartesian coordinates ) increased the tidal stripping and heating by about 20% .",
    "increasing ( decreasing ) the distance of m31 by 34 kpc [ @xmath71 times the @xmath72 precision of the observations in mcconnachie et al .",
    "( 2004,2005 ) ] also increased ( decreased ) the stripping by @xmath73% .",
    "the conclusions of the paper would change significantly only if the distance to m31 is decreased by @xmath74 kpc ( or through a similar increase in m33 s distance , since the tidal effect depends primarily on the separation between m31 and m33 ) .",
    "finally , rotating the original stellar disk of m33 by @xmath75 ( from the @xmath49 to the @xmath63 plane ) reduced the stripping and heating by about 30% .",
    "overall , we conclude that our results are only sensitive at the level of tens of percent to uncertainties in the initial configuration of our simulations .",
    "one other constraint on the proper motion of m31 results from the `` timing '' argument @xcite .",
    "because the universe has expanded considerably over the past @xmath76  gyr , galaxies ( or proto - galaxies ) should have been closer together in the distant past than they are today .",
    "any large proper motion for m31 violates this argument . since our calculations produce a time history of the separation of m31 and the milky way , we plotted this separation as a function of time and determined the approximate range of m31 proper motions for which these galaxies were closer together 10 gyr ago than today .",
    "the regions inside the dashed ellipses in figure  2 indicate approximately the proper motions of m31 for which this occurs . for values of @xmath77",
    ", we have found that m31 and the milky way were never closer together in the past than today , for any of our trial proper motions of m31 .",
    "since this violates the timing argument , we do not show values of @xmath78 in figure 2 .    for the fiducial case of @xmath79 and a lookback time of 10 gyr ( top panel ) ,",
    "the allowed proper - motion parameter space delineates an annular arc @xmath80  wide that starts near @xmath81 , goes counter clockwise through @xmath82 and @xmath83 , to @xmath84  along right ascension and declination .",
    "additional small `` islands '' of moderate stripping and heating exist with smaller likelihood .",
    "figure 3 shows the separation between m33 and m31 as a function of lookback time for the various trial proper motions of m31 .",
    "since we initiate all orbits by integrating m33 s orbit back in time without stripping and then integrate these orbits forward in time with stripping , we lose time - reversal symmetry and so there is some variation in the final separation between m31 and m33 among the different cases . throughout the entire range allowed by the timing argument ( delineated by the dashed line ) , m33 orbits around m31 several times as expected from a gravitationally - bound satellite .",
    "the repeated encounters , while not disruptive in the allowed range of proper motions , might have still stripped material from the outskirts of m33 and could potentially account for the streams of gas @xcite and stars @xcite that are observed in between the two galaxies today .",
    "figure 2 presents our limits on the proper motion of m31 based on the constraint that the thin stellar disk of m33 ( simulated as an ensemble of collisionless test particles on circular orbits ) was not tidally disrupted over the past @xmath85 years through its orbit within the local group .",
    "this constraint and the condition that m31 and the milky way galaxies were closer in the past , favors a proper motion amplitude of @xmath0 for m31 with the quadrant of a negative velocity component along right ascension and a positive component along declination strongly ruled - out .",
    "the orbital angular momentum associated with the allowed range of proper motions implies that the dark halos of andromeda and the milky way will pass through each other within the next 510 billion years .",
    "the main uncertainty in our results involves the dark halo masses of the local group members ( compare the top two panels in fig .",
    "our inference relies on the validity of various simplifying assumptions .",
    "for example , we simulated the dynamics of m33 without taking account of the full dark - matter distribution interior to the local group ( including the mass in between the milky way and andromeda ) .",
    "in addition , we have assumed that the tidal influence of external objects on the local group can be neglected , and we have ignored the addition of mass to the local group through accretion and infall of external matter . obviously , the milky way and the andromeda galaxies grew hierarchically with cosmic time but the ages and low velocity dispersion of stars within their disks argue against major merging encounters over the past 10 billion years @xcite .",
    "our quantitative predictions provide an added incentive for future astrometric observatories such as sim , gaia,26 ] or the ska , that will be able to test them @xcite .",
