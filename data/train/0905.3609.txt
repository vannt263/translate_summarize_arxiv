    "the phase structure of qcd , as a function of temperature @xmath5 and quark - chemical potential @xmath15 , represents the breaking patterns of the relevant symmetries in qcd .",
    "simultaneously , each qcd phase can be characterized by the corresponding order parameters , reflecting the nature of the symmetries . in this sense , exploring the qcd phase diagram is of great importance in understanding strongly interacting systems .",
    "especially , recent energetic progresses , achieved in the ultra - high energy experimental facilities , such as the rhic , have triggered much interest to investigate the qcd phase structure in the vicinity of high @xmath16 , whereas @xmath15 remains relatively small , being similar to the early universe .",
    "starting from the first principle , the lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations must be a promising method to investigate this region ( @xmath1 and @xmath17 ) with less difficulties , such as the sign problem  @xcite .",
    "many attempts have been also done in various effective field - theoretical approaches  @xcite . among them , interestingly enough , the polyakov - loop - augmented nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model describes the crossover of the two different qcd order parameters for the chiral and @xmath9 symmetries , represented by the chiral condensate @xmath18 and the traced polyakov loop @xmath19 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath9 symmetry is intact , @xmath8 becomes zero , indicating the confinement phase . on the contrary ,",
    "provided that the symmetry is broken spontaneously , one has @xmath20 for the deconfinement one .",
    "instanton model can be also thought as an appropriate framework to be employed for this finite-@xmath5 subject , considering that it has provided remarkable descriptions so far for various nonperturbative qcd and hadron properties .",
    "note that the instanton solution at finite @xmath5 , being periodic in euclidean time , i.e. , _ caloron _ turned out to be essential for this purpose  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless for its relevance , its practical application is still under development  @xcite .",
    "confinement properties have been discussed as well with semi - classical objects , such as the meron ( a half of regular - gauge instanton ) , by indicating the area law for the wilson loop  @xcite .",
    "the caloron with non - trivial holonomy , so called the kraan - van baal - lee - lu ( kvbll ) caloron  @xcite , was taken into account as a lump of dyons to understand the confinement  @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we want to construct an effective thermodynamic potential ( @xmath0 ) at finite @xmath5 with @xmath2 , employing the instanton framework .",
    "our strategy is rather simple and practical as follows :    * using the instanton distribution function at finite @xmath5 from the caloron solution with trivial holonomy ( the harrington - shepard caloron )  @xcite , we first compute the instanton density and average size of instanton as functions of @xmath5 , resulting in that the instanton effect remains finite even beyond the critical temperature @xmath21 . combining these ingredients ,",
    "we finally obtain ( @xmath22(three momentum ) , @xmath5(temperature))-dependent constituent - quark mass @xmath23 , @xmath24 , which plays the most important role in the present approach . * in constructing @xmath0 , we take into account a practical way , instead of using the caloron and its quark zero - mode solution : @xmath0 is obtained by applying the matsubara formula to the effective action , which is derived from the usual singular - gauge instanton solution at @xmath25 , as done usually in effective models  @xcite . * the singular - gauge instanton solution is nothing to do with the confinement  @xcite . on the contrary , it explains the nonperturbative qcd properties very well in terms of the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry ( sb@xmath10s ) . hence , considering the chiral and @xmath9 symmetries on the same footing as in the pnjl model , we introduce the imaginary quark - chemical potential @xmath7 , which corresponds to the uniform color gauge field in the polyakov gauge . it will be translated later as the traced polyakov loop @xmath8 , as an order parameter for the spontaneous breakdown of @xmath9 symmetry , i.e. , the deconfinement phase transition .    considering all these ingredients",
    ", we can write a neat expression for @xmath0 as a function of @xmath5 with @xmath24 . by solving the saddle - point equations with respect to the mean fields",
    ", we can draw the curves for @xmath11 and @xmath8 as functions of @xmath5 . from the numerical calculations , we observe that the first - order deconfinment phase transition in pure - glue qcd is modified to the crossover one , according to the mixing of dynamical quarks and @xmath8 in @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , the mixing gives only negligible modification on @xmath11 . as a result",
    ", the crossover of the two different qcd order parameters is shown by the mixing .",
    "it also turns out that @xmath26 for the deconfinment phase transition ( @xmath12 ) is lowered by about @xmath27 with @xmath28 , in comparison to the case with a constant @xmath23 ( @xmath29 mev ) . from this observation",
    ", we can conclude that the nontrivial qcd vacuum contribution and partial chiral restoration play a considerable role even for deconfinment phase transition .",
    "the numerical results show that @xmath30 mev and @xmath31 mev .",
    "the discrepancy between them becomes about @xmath32 mev , which is rather larger than that computed in the local pnjl model  @xcite .",
    "we note that the lqcd simulations provides smaller values than ours , whereas @xmath33 is comparable  @xcite .",
    "we also find that @xmath11 depends much on the partial chiral restoration .",
    "we organize the present work as follows : we explain briefly the instanton properties and the effective chiral action derived at @xmath25 in section  ii .",
    "the instanton distribution function at finite @xmath5 is introduced , and @xmath34 is computed in section  iii . in section",
    "iv , utilizing @xmath34 obtained in the previous section , we construct an effective thermodynamic potential using the matsubara formula with @xmath35 , which is translated into the traced polyakov loop . the numerical results for @xmath11 and @xmath8 as functions of @xmath5 and related discussions are given in section  v. the final section is devoted to summary and conclusion .",
    "in this section , we want to explain the instanton framework for vacuum ( @xmath25 and @xmath2 ) briefly .",
    "first , we consider a grand canonical ensemble of dilute instantons , which indicate the tunneling in euclidean time , as a dominant nonpertubative contribution of the qcd vacuum . in this framework , in principle , we have two phenomenolgical parameters such as the average instanton size @xmath36 fm and inter - instanton distance @xmath37 fm  @xcite , where the subscript zero indicates vacuum . according to these values , the renomalization scale of this framework can be estimated as @xmath38 mev .",
    "it is convenient to start with the quark zero mode in the presence of the instanton background in the chiral limit , assuming that the nonperturbative qcd properties are dominated by the zero mode : @xmath39 where @xmath40 stands for a singular - gauge ( anti)instanton solution , which can be obtained by minimizing the ym action , considering the self - dual equation and the so(4 ) symmetry for the field strength tensor @xmath41 in euclidean space : @xmath42 where @xmath43 indicates the t hooft symbol  @xcite .",

    "in the present work , we have attempted to construct an effective thermodynamic potential @xmath0 at finite @xmath5 and zero quark - chemical potential ( @xmath2 ) in the chiral limit.we restricted ourselves to @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "motivated by the polyakov - loop - augmented nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model , we wanted to incorporate two different order parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath8 , which characterize the chiral and deconfinment phase transitions , respectively .    in order to discuss the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry at finite @xmath5 , we employed the singular - gauge instanton solution , and the fermionic matsubara formula to express the effective chiral action as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "we employed the instanton - distribution function , derived from the harrington - shepard caloron , to obtain the instanton density and average instanton size as functions of @xmath5 .",
    "it turned out that these two quantities decreased but finite , indicating that the instanton effect survives even beyond @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "the ( @xmath130)-dependent @xmath23 , @xmath28 was derived in the large-@xmath6 limit .",
    "we found that the @xmath22 dependence of @xmath23 becomes weaker as @xmath5 increases . at the same time , the absolute value of @xmath28 was also reduced with respect to @xmath5 . to include the polyakov loop as an order parameter for the @xmath9 symmetry",
    ", we took into account imaginary quark - chemical potential @xmath204 , which was translated as the traced polyakov loop @xmath8 . combining all these ingredients",
    ", we could construct @xmath205 with an additional pure - glue su(@xmath183 ) gauge potential . by minimizing @xmath205 with respect to external fields such as @xmath67 and @xmath8",
    ", we could compute @xmath11 and @xmath8 as functions of @xmath5 numerically . from the various numerical results we have found the followings :    * in the presence of the mixing of the dynamical quarks and @xmath8",
    ", we observed that @xmath8 is very sensitive to the mixing , showing the crosssover and first - order transitions with and without it , respectively .",
    "in contrast , @xmath11 is insensitive to it , indicating the crossover phase transition .",
    "* @xmath23 was expressed as a decreasing function of @xmath5 as well as @xmath22 . due to this , @xmath33 was lowered by about @xmath13 , in comparison to that with constant mass @xmath29 mev . from this observation ,",
    "we explain this lowering @xmath33 by that the nontrivial qcd vacuum contributions and partial chiral restoration play a significant role even in the deconfinment phase transition . * if the ( @xmath130 ) dependence had been fully taken into account , we found that @xmath31 mev and @xmath30 mev .",
    "the discrepancy between them became about @xmath32 mev , which was rather larger than that computed in the pnjl model .",
    "we also note that the lqcd simulations presented smaller @xmath170 than ours , whereas @xmath33 was compatible . *",
    "finally , we observed that @xmath11 was depending much on @xmath5 .",
    "again , the partial chiral restoration turned out to be crucial to make proper results for the chiral phase transition .",
    "consequently , from the present work , we could learn that the partial chiral restoration and nontrivial qcd vacuum effects must be taken into account appropriately to investigate the breaking patterns of the chiral and @xmath9 symmetries at finite @xmath5 . as a next step , we attempt to include the finite quark - chemical potential ( @xmath206 ) , giving a full description for the qcd phase diagram on the @xmath206-@xmath5 plane .",
    "in addition to it , the finite current - quark mass , @xmath46 is also under consideration beyond the chiral limit .",
    "this is important , since the explicit breakdown of the flavor su(@xmath207 ) symmetry modifies the qcd phase diagram to a good extent .",
    "however , including finite @xmath46 into the present framework has a huddle : one needs to consider the meson - loop corrections , which make significant modification on the physical quantities such as the chiral susceptibility , in comparison to those in the chiral limit  @xcite .",
