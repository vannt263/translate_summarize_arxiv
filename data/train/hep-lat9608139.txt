    "last year collins , edwards , heller , and sloan  @xcite studied heavy wilson quarks  @xcite with the improved action of sheikholeslami and wohlert  @xcite . in lattice units the heavy - quark mass  @xmath0 typically exceeded unity , a regime in which the numerical results require a nonrelativistic interpretation   just as in nrqcd  @xcite .",
    "@xcite presents a test of the nonrelativistic interpretation that removes kinematic effects and focuses on a dynamical effect  the binding energy .",
    "the results of this test were unexpectedly anomalous .",
    "the aim of this paper is to explain why and to offer a remedy .",
    "let us begin with some basics to define notation . as a function of momentum  @xmath1 the energy of a state",
    "@xmath2 can be written @xmath3 where the rest mass is defined by @xmath4 , and the kinetic mass is defined by @xmath5 below the states can be quarks ,  @xmath6 and  @xmath7 , and mesons  @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and  @xmath10 .",
    "usually  @xmath6 is assumed heavier than  @xmath7 .    on a relativistic mass shell",
    "@xmath11 in this paper the lower - case  @xmath12 denotes the exact , physical mass , whereas upper - case  @xmath13 denote the result of a ( possibly approximate ) calculation . in the mass - dependent renormalization of ref .",
    "@xcite it is possible to adjust the action s couplings to recover eq .",
    "( [ shell ] ) , to a specified accuracy . with the wilson or sheikholeslami - wohlert actions",
    ", however , perturbation theory shows that @xmath14 ( except as @xmath15 ) . in nonrelativistic systems",
    "this is acceptable , provided one adjusts the bare mass until the _ kinetic _ mass takes its physical value  , just as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the quark state makes sense at most in perturbation theory . in a nonperturbative world",
    ", one would like to carry out the tuning with a bound state , e.g.  a meson @xmath16 whose masses @xmath17 , @xmath18 , etc , can be computed with monte carlo methods .",
    "let us define the binding energy  @xmath19 by @xmath20          m_{2\\bar{q}q } & m_{2\\bar{q } } + m_{2q } + b_{2}.      \\end{array }      \\label{binding}\\ ] ] to make a precise definition of the binding energies , one requires a precise definition of the quark masses in eq .",
    "( [ binding ] ) . here",
    "it is enough to take the rest and kinetic masses of the free theory ( @xmath21 ) with the _ same _ bare quark masses .",
    "computing bound - state splittings through rest masses makes sense only if  @xmath22 is the experimental binding energy , to sufficient accuracy .",
    "similarly , tuning the meson mass to the kinetic mass makes sense only if also  @xmath23 is the experimental binding energy , to sufficient accuracy .    as shown below , the anomalous result of ref .",
    "@xcite is sensitive to @xmath24 .",
    "there are two keys to understanding it .",
    "first , one must be careful about the qualifying phrase `` to sufficient accuracy '' in the preceding paragraph .",
    "second , one must to know how field theories communicate the binding energy to a bound state s kinetic mass .",
    "[ test ] recalls the diagnostic test of ref .",

    "[ conclusions ] draws a few conclusions .",
    "let us abbreviate @xmath25 and @xmath26 . ref .",
    "@xcite introduces @xmath27 comparison with eqs .",
    "( [ binding ] ) shows that the quark masses drop out , leaving @xmath28 if the lattice action(s ) of the quarks were sufficiently accurate , all @xmath29s , and hence  @xmath30 , would vanish .",
    "( @xmath30 vanishes trivially when @xmath31 , even if @xmath32 . )    the numerical results of ref .",

    "before presenting the analytical result for @xmath29 , it is useful to anticipate the order of magnitude of @xmath29 in each meson  light - light , heavy - light , and quarkonium . on this basis",
    "it turns out that the quarkonium @xmath35 dominates the numerator in eq .",
    "( [ i b ] ) .",
    "the binding energy is @xmath37 . with the sheikholeslami - wohlert action , @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "both suffer from lattice artifacts of @xmath38 . with the tree - level improvement of used by ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath39 .",
    "( with the wilson action @xmath40 . )",
    "there is no reason for the artifacts to be identical , so @xmath36 is @xmath41 .",
    "this is numerically small , so @xmath36 can be neglected below .",
    "the binding energy is again @xmath37 .",
    "the light quark suffers lattice artifacts as above , but , when @xmath43as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sloan ] , the heavy quark also suffers from ( smaller ) effects of @xmath44 . again",
    ", even though there is no reason for artifacts in  @xmath22 and  @xmath23 to cancel , one sees that @xmath42 is numerically negligible .",
    "the binding energy is now @xmath45 , where  @xmath46 denotes the relative @xmath47-@xmath6 velocity . in this nonrelativistic system ,",
    "the velocity is a pertinent estimator of cutoff effects  @xcite .",
    "the rest mass is @xmath48 , so the action would need absolute accuracy of @xmath49 to obtain relative accuracy of @xmath49 in  @xmath22 .",
    "both the wilson and sheikholeslami - wohlert actions achieve this . on the other hand , the kinetic mass multiplies an @xmath49 effect , so the action would now need an absolute accuracy of @xmath50 to obtain relative accuracy of @xmath49 in  @xmath23 .",
    "neither the wilson nor the sheikholeslami - wohlert action achieves this  @xcite ; with either of them , one can only hope for  @xmath48 relative accuracy in  @xmath23 .",
    "the error in  @xmath23 , and hence in  @xmath51 , is  @xmath45 , which is significantly larger than the previous two estimates .",
    "for nonrelativistic systems the binding - energy discrepancy can be worked out quantitatively , following a textbook nonrelativistic expansion of qed  @xcite .",
    "this section verifies in a relativistically invariant theory that @xmath52 .",
    "the next section then turns to the lattice theories , which break relativistic invariance . for convenience ,",
    "these two section assume that even the `` light '' quark  @xmath7 is nonrelativistic .",
    "at leading order the quark  anti - quark interaction arises from one - gluon exchange diagrams . evaluating these diagrams and developing the nonrelativistic expansion , one obtains a hamiltonian @xmath53 for the quark  anti - quark system .",
    "the leading nonrelativistic dynamics are given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 ; @xmath56 , @xmath57 and  @xmath1 are center - of mass coordinates and momentum ; @xmath58 is the reduced mass ; and @xmath59 .",
    "the first relativistic corrections are @xmath60 where the non - local potential @xmath61 is given by breit s equation  @xcite .",
    "it takes the form @xmath62",
    "\\hspace*{2.5em } + \\,v(r)\\left[1-          \\dfrac{\\vek{p}_{\\bar{q}}{\\!\\cdot\\!}\\vek{p}_q +                 r^{-2}r_ir_j p_{\\bar{q}i}p_{qj}}{2m_{\\bar{q}q}\\mu }          \\right ] \\\\[1.0em ]      \\hspace*{2.5em } + \\;\\mbox{spin - dependent}. \\end{array }        \\label{v2}\\ ] ] the spin - dependent terms and the terms proportional to @xmath63 are not important here .",
    "full details are given in  ",
    "8384 of ref .",
    "together with the @xmath64 terms in  @xmath65 , the exhibited part of  @xmath61 is responsible for modifying the bound - state kinetic mass from @xmath59 to @xmath66 ( as required by lorentz invariance ) .    to proceed one must re - write  @xmath65 in center - of - mass momenta and collect terms quadratic in the total bound - state momentum  @xmath57 . in the bound state ,",
    "combinations of the internal momentum  @xmath1 and relative coordinate  @xmath67 can be replaced by expectation values . collecting all terms ,",
    "the bound - state kinetic energy becomes @xmath68      + &      \\dfrac{p_ip_j}{2m^2_{\\bar{q}q } }      \\left\\langle r_i\\nabla_jv - p_ip_j/\\mu\\right\\rangle , \\end{array }      \\label{mm}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the internal kinetic energy . by the virial theorem the second line vanishes .",
    "thus , to consistent order in @xmath70 the leading relativistic corrections  @xmath65 generates the right binding energy @xmath71 for the bound - state kinetic mass .",
    "more generally , higher - order relativistic effects trickle down to bound - state properties as follows : the correction of  @xmath72 provides the @xmath73 contribution to bound - state properties of  @xmath74 .",
    "on a hypercubic lattice there can be two corrections to the kinetic energy @xmath75 for each of @xmath76 , @xmath77 . here",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath79 unless the action has been improved _ further _ than the sheikholeslami - wohlert action , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , cf .  appendix  a of ref .",
    "these lattice artifacts filter through to  @xmath23just as above  through the terms proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "the spatial gluon generates the spin - independent contribution proportional to @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) ; on the lattice the nuance is that the kinetic mass appears in the bracket . on the other hand , the temporal gluon generates more complicated terms , but they either depend on spin or are proportional to  @xmath63 .",
    "so to work out an expression for  @xmath23 , it is enough to maintain eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) , but with masses  @xmath18 and  @xmath84 built from  @xmath85 and  @xmath86 .",
    "the calculation of the binding energy difference  @xmath29 follows the steps leading to eq .",
    "( [ mm ] ) .",

    "[ fig : sloan ] , i find @xmath92 the agreement with the monte carlo results is surprisingly good .",
    "the origin of the anomaly observed in ref .",

    "meanwhile , the usual binding energy  @xmath22 is indeed valid to leading order in  @xmath94 .",

    ", this paper explains the results found last year  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the analysis makes the remedy plain : the anomaly is not expected to appear if quarkonium properties are computed with an action improved through @xmath50 ( or higher ) . in particular , one requires @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
