    "our knowledge and understanding of the sun has improved considerably with the study of the solar oscillations , leading to important modifications in the solar- and stellar - evolution models .",
    "indeed , through the accurate measurements of the frequencies of acoustic modes , helioseismology has represented a revolution in solar physics , revealing a detailed picture of the structure of the sun and its internal rotation for instance ( see * ? ? ? * for a detailed review ) .",
    "furthermore , in the last decade , the solar p - mode parameters have also been demonstrated to be very sensitive to changes in solar activity , showing that they can also help us reach a better understanding of the processes driving the solar magnetic cycle , and of the physics of the acoustic modes themselves as , for example , the processes responsible for their excitation and damping .",
    "the first reports about the variability of the p - mode parameters concerned the mode frequencies .",
    "@xcite found that modes with degrees @xmath2=0 and @xmath2=1 presented a change in the central frequency of 0.42  @xmath3  0.14  @xmath1hz .",
    "few years later , @xcite and @xcite also observed significant variations in the p - mode central frequency for intermediate degrees .",
    "the quantity of observations increasing , thanks to ground - based networks and later on space - based instruments , deeper analysis were carried out for low - degree modes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and intermediate and high - degree modes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , establishing , for instance , a strong @xmath2-dependence in the frequency shifts .",
    "the study of the relations between the p - mode heights and widths with the solar cycle is a more difficult task to achieve . indeed , since their estimations are subject to several observational effects and that long datasets are needed , the first reports of their variabilities with solar activity were sometimes contradictory .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite reported an increase in mode widths with increasing activity in low- and medium-@xmath2 observations respectively , while no significant change were found by @xcite with full - disk data .",
    "today , the quality and the amount of available data ( some of the instruments are collecting data since more than a solar cycle ) are such that it is now possible to have reliable estimates of the mode heights and widths and to study the variability with the solar cycle of the underlying p - mode damping and excitation .",
    "recent work achieved with low-@xmath2 data ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also with intermediate-@xmath2 data ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown significant temporal changes in the mode heights , mode widths , and mode energies ( proportional to height@xmath4width ) , as previously observed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "all these recent studies also reported that the temporal variation of the p - mode excitation ( proportional to height@xmath4width@xmath5 ) is consistent with a zero change .    here , we made use of the spatially - resolved lowl observations obtained between beginning of 1994 and end of 1999 to carry out an independent study of the temporal variations of the p - mode damping and excitation rates with solar activity . by use of our own data analysis and peak - finding codes ,",
    "we compared the observed changes for modes from @xmath6 to @xmath7 to the unique observations made so far at intermediate-@xmath2 obtained with gong data @xcite .",
    "the single - site helioseismic instrument lowl , located at the mauna loa solar observatory , hawaii ( usa ) , has been acquiring data since february 1994 .",
    "this instrument allows simultaneous observations of low- and intermediate - degree solar oscillations with spatial resolution .",
    "the lowl instrument is a doppler imager based on a magneto - optical filter .",
    "it employs a two - beam technique to simultaneously observe the solar disk in opposite wings of the absorption line of potassium at 769.9  nm .",
    "images are obtained every 15  @xmath8 with a spatial resolution of 25  @xmath9 . the intensity difference between images obtained in both wings of the spectral line",
    "are related to the doppler shift of the line , providing a measurement of the line - of - sight velocity of the observed area .",
    "the instrument is extremely stable against zero - point drifts and immune to noise source due to intensity fluctuations and image motions .",
    "some of the main advantages of the instrument are its wide velocity range where the doppler analyzer is linear , the absence of moving parts in the optics and an improved thermal control system .",
    "these attributes render it one of the best experiments for the observations of low and intermediate - degree oscillations .",
    "a more detailed description of the instrument as well as a deeper discussion of its characteristics can be found in @xcite .",
    "the dopplergram ( or velocity ) images are obtained using the blue and red intensity images obtained through the two transmission bands , and were averaged over 1 minute intervals .",
    "once the velocity images calibrated , a spherical harmonic decomposition is performed on each of them in order to create timeseries for mode degrees from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "a spectral analysis of each of the timeseries allow us to extract the main features of the acoustic modes .",
    "detailed explanations of the lowl data reduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "the observations used in the present analysis begin march 1st 1994 and end october 12 1999 , spanning the decreasing phase and the minimum of the solar cycle 22 and the rising phase of the solar cycle 23 .",
    "they were divided into 19 independent timeseries of 108 days with a 60  s cadence ( table  [ table : tseries ] ) , following the 36-d gong month reference ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) .",
    "the duty cycles ( or temporal fills ) of the timeseries are very similar , about 20@xmath10 , and since the observations were obtained from just one site , the timeseries present regular gaps every 24 hours which induce temporal sidelobes , located at @xmath11hz away from the main peak . these sidelobes were taken into account during the fitting process of the p - mode parameters ( sec .  [ sec : fittingproc ] ) .",
    "note also that the spectra with the 3 lowest fill values were removed for this analysis , so 16 108-d independent timeseries were used .",

    "however , the spherical harmonics are not orthogonal over the observed area , limited to half a sphere introducing correlations between different ( @xmath2,@xmath13 ) modes .",
    "therefore , the observed power spectra , in the case of resolved observations , are a linear combination of different modes , commonly represented by the so - called leakage matrix @xmath14 .",
    "it describes the imperfect isolation of the individual modes .",
    "we will discern two types of leakage signal : the spatial leaks , from same ( @xmath15,@xmath2 ) modes , and the mode contamination from different ( @xmath15,@xmath2 ) modes .    in this particular case",
    ", it can be proven that the statistics of the real and imaginary part of the fourier transform of the ( @xmath2,@xmath13 ) modes follow a multi - normal distribution described by the so - called covariance matrix @xcite . however , as the degree of the target mode increases , the covariance matrix becomes nearly singular leading to a subsequent failure of the fitting procedure .",
    "we decided to perform a maximum - likelihood minimization using the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix to estimate the set of parameters , @xmath16 , describing the p - mode profiles , it is : @xmath17.\\ ] ] the sum runs over all the points in frequency and over the ( 2@xmath2 + 1 ) @xmath13-components of the multiplet .",
    "the power spectrum of the target mode is denoted by @xmath18 , while @xmath19 models the power spectrum and may be written as the superposition of the spatial leaks and mode contamination , i.e. : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a non - asymmetric lorenztian profile defined by : @xmath22 thus , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are respectively the mode height , the mode width and the background noise , while @xmath26 is the central frequency for each @xmath13-component of the multiplet .",
    "@xmath27 is the ratio of the height of the sidelobes to the height of the main peak , estimated for each time series and @xmath28 is the constant separation of the sidelobes , equal to 11.57@xmath1hz .",
    "note we have taken into account the 3 first sidelobes . as observed , for example , by @xcite , the p - mode profiles possess small but significant levels of asymmetry : however in the case of the present analysis , the signal - to - noise ratio obtained with observations from one single - site instrument does not allow reliable estimations of the asymmetry parameter .",
    "in order to constrain the number of free parameters during the minimization process , we assumed that each @xmath13-component is well described by a non - asymmetric lorenztian profile ( eq .  [ eq : lorentz ] ) .",
    "regarding the central frequency for each @xmath13-component @xmath26 , it is represented by : @xmath29 the polynomials @xmath30 are the @xcite polynomials defined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "the coefficients @xmath31 represent the shift in frequency induced mainly by the internal rotation .",
    "the number of @xmath32-coefficients was fixed to 1 for @xmath33 ; 4 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; 6 for @xmath36 and 9 for @xmath37 .",
    "the mode parameters are constrained by performing simultaneous fits of the spatial leaks with the implicit assumption that the mode contamination is known .",
    "the process becomes thus iterative , improving in each iteration the mode contamination dominated ( for intermediate degrees ) by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the process is iterated until the mode frequency changes between iterations drops below a given threshold .",
    "finally , the fits are performed inside a narrow window centered on each @xmath13-component .",
    "using initial guesses obtained from a collapsed diagram @xcite , an iterative process was used to converge to the best estimates of the mode parameters of the 16 108-d independent series .",
    "the natural logarithms of the mode height , width , and background noise have been fitted , not the parameters themselves , resulting in a normal distribution which allows the uncertainties on each parameter to be determined from the inverse hessian matrix .",
    "the mode damping rate , @xmath40 , is directly related to the mode width , @xmath24 , by :    @xmath41    the velocity power , or mode power , @xmath42 , of a given mode @xmath43 corresponds to the area under the mode , which is a combination of the mode height , @xmath23 , and the mode width , @xmath24 .",
    "it can be written as :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is a constant to correct for the effects of the observational techniques . using the analogy of the harmonic damped oscillator ,",

    "in what follows , we focus on studying the temporal variations in the damping and the excitation rates of the p - mode oscillations .",
    "since the peak - finding procedure returns the best estimates in natural logarithm values of the mode height and width , any temporal variations in these parameters ( and any additive combinations of the two ) will correspond to the fractional variations of these parameters ( and any multiplicative combinations of the two ) .",
    "the constant @xmath45 and the mode masses , @xmath49 , are assumed to remain constant over the solar cycle , and then can be ignored in the present analysis . concerning the determination of the uncertainties in the variations of the mode velocity power , @xmath42 , and the energy supply rate , @xmath51 , they are estimated by the formula for non - independent variables , taking into account the strong anticorrelation ( taken to be equal to -0.9 ) between the fitted mode width , @xmath24 , and height , @xmath23 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hereafter , we represent the logarithm values of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath42 , and @xmath51 by @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "the presence of gaps in the observations leads to a redistribution of power from the main lobe into sidelobes and into the background .",
    "the estimates of the mode heights and of the mode widths will be then affected , the heights being underestimated and the widths overestimated . as shown in @xcite , the observed bias is a function of the mode degree and the mode frequency . moreover",
    ", the effects due to the presence of gaps will be larger as the fill factor decreases .",
    "figure  [ fig : width_mdi ] shows an example of the variation in the estimation of the mode width ( for @xmath15=12 , @xmath56 ) between a fill of nearly 100% and the actual lowl fill factors .",
    "the plotted lowl width estimates were normalized by the corresponding value obtained with contemporaneous timeseries from the space - based instrument soho / mdi , which is supposedly very close to the _ true _ value .",
    "@xcite , using gong data , showed that a simple linear model provides an adequate description of the overestimation of the mode widths as the fill factor decreases to correct the observed bias from the fill factor on the other mode parameters .",
    "] , as :    @xmath57    where d is the value of the fractional temporal fill ; @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the intercept and the gradient respectively . in that simple model ,",
    "the intercept @xmath58 corresponds to the extrapolated width value for 100% fill , which supposes that this model is correct up to a fill of 100% .",
    "even though this linear description is correct over a limited range of fills close to an ideal fill of 100% , it is not the case over a large range of duty cycles as we can see in figure  [ fig : width_mdi ] .    in this paper , we are interested in the temporal variations of the damping and excitation p - mode parameters , and not in their absolute estimates .",
    "then , we can modify equation  [ eq : fillcorr_komm ] in order to have a simple model which describes the bias from the fill factor and corrects it to the mean fill value , @xmath60 , of the analysed lowl timeseries , instead of a 100% fill .",
    "we also checked the degree of the polynomial necessary to describe such bias .",
    "we followed the cross - validation method described in @xcite and adapted from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it consists in dividing randomly our data sets into two subsets , fit one subset with the polynomial and calculate the average errors between the model and the fitted subset ( also called _ in - sample error _ ) , and the average errors between the model and the excluded subset ( or _ out - sample error _ ) , and repeat this procedure for several polynomial degrees .",
    "the in - sample error is expected to decrease with increasing model complexity , while the out - sample error will decrease up to a certain degree and then increase again when the model overfits the data .",
    "the minimum in the out - sample error as a function of the polynomial degree defines the best model .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : in - out_error ] shows the corresponding results for the mode widths , and the right panel for the mode heights .",
    "the original 16 timeseries were divided into two subsets of 8 series each . on figure  [ fig : in - out_error ] , the average in- and out - sample errors were normalized by the in - sample error of the polynomial of degree 1 . on both panels ,",
    "the in - sample errors ( crosses ) decrease with an increasing polynomial degree , whereas the out - sample errors ( squares ) shows a minimum for a degree of polynomial fit equal to 1 , indicating that a linear fit is the best model describing the dependence of the mode widths and heights with the fill factor .",
    "therefore , we decided to describe by a linear polynomial the bias introduced by the window functions on the p - mode parameters at each ( @xmath61 ) multiplet , but using the mean fill value , @xmath60 , instead of a 100% fill , as :    @xmath62    where @xmath63 stands for any of the mode parameters , where @xmath64 $ ] , and d is the fill factor . @xmath58 and @xmath59 are again the intercept and the gradient respectively .",
    "when looking for temporal variations in the p - mode parameters , equation  [ eq : fillcorr ] is a sufficient description of the temporal window effects over a limited range of fill factor values .",
    "ideally , by modulating the soho / mdi data with a large range of window functions between a 100% fill and fills around 20% ( typical fill factor for a single - site instrument , as lowl ) , we could determine an emperical model to describe the non - linear dependence between the damping and excitation p - mode parameters and the fill factors in a range from a 100% fill to lower duty cycles .",
    "this issue will be addressed in a future work .      to search for solar - cycle variations , we add to equation  [ eq : fillcorr ] a polynomial term function of a solar activity proxy ( sap )",
    ". then equation  [ eq : fillcorr ] becomes :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is a measure of the fractional changes of each of the parameters @xmath67 per unit of solar activity .",
    "the linear dependence between the p - mode parameters and solar activity has already been demonstrated by previous studies using low - degree observations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and using intermediate - degree observations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by use of the multi - linear regression described by equation  [ eq : lincorr ]",
    ", we extracted the fractional temporal changes @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , corresponding respectively to the changes in the mode height , width , velocity power and energy supply rate , corrected from the bias due to the temporal fill . this regression was performed on the estimates of 16 108-d independent timeseries , weighted by the uncertainties returned by the peak - finding procedure , and for each mode frequency and degree . over all the studied frequency range and mode degrees , the changes in mode parameters due to solar activity are about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding changes due to the fill factor .",
    "@xcite reported also larger effects due to the fill factor in gong data in comparison to the effects from solar activity , but of about 1 order of magnitude .",
    "the reason for this difference of order of magnitude between lowl and gong observations is because the effects of the fill factor are not linear in a range from high duty cycles to lower duty cycles .",
    "we studied these temporal variations in p - mode parameters using 3 indices of global surface activity : the kitt peak magnetic index ( kpmi ) , obtained from the kitt peak magnetograms ; the sunspot number ( @xmath72 ) , and the integrated radio flux at 10.7  cm ( @xmath73 ) , the two last indices obtained from the national geophysical data center .",
    "a detailed discussion about the relations among several solar activity proxies can be found in @xcite .",
    "the multi - linear regression ( eq .  [ eq : lincorr ] ) was performed on the good estimates defined by a set of good - fit criteria in order to remove obvious unreasonable values , as : ( 1 ) the mode width must be within a factor of 5 of its initial guess ; ( 2 ) the difference between the mode frequency and its initial guess must be less than the corresponding initial guess in mode width ; and ( 3 ) the uncertainty of the mode frequency must be less than the initial guess in mode width .",
    "moreover , in order to remove the possible systematic errors due to the blending of the leaked modes and their sidelobes into the target modes , we only kept the modes with @xmath74 .",
    "about 20% of the initial fitted modes were then removed from the estimate tables .",
    "the set of common modes used in the following analysis is composed of 771 modes ( figure  [ fig : lnu ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fracnuflux ] shows the fractional changes in percent of the studied mode parameters per unit of change in the solar radio flux , @xmath73 , for the mode degrees @xmath75 as a function of the frequency .",

    "these changes of behaviour as a function of @xmath2 are most probably not related to solar activity , but rather could be the result of lower quality estimates of the parameters due to the blending of the leaked modes with the target modes , and also because of a much lower number of estimates . for these reasons , we limited all our discussions throughout this paper for modes with @xmath79 .",
