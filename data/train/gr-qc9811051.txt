    "in studies of the dynamics of spatially homogeneous cosmological models it is usual to choose a perfect fluid with linear equation of state to describe the matter .",
    "the book @xcite provides an excellent guide to the subject . in view of the fact that this restriction is made so frequently in the literature",
    ", it is natural to pose the question to what extent the conclusions obtained would change if the matter model were chosen differently . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that in the case of collisionless matter described by the vlasov equation significant changes can occur in comparison with the case of a perfect fluid .",
    "more specifically , it was shown that a solution of bianchi type i exists whose qualitative behaviour near the initial singularity is different from that of any spacetime of that bianchi type whose matter content is a fluid with a physically reasonable equation of state , linear or nonlinear . in the following this analysis will be generalized to show just how different models with collisionless matter can be from models with perfect fluid having the same symmetry .",
    "differences are found in models of bianchi type ii ( theorem 4.2 ) , bianchi type iii ( theorem 5.2 ) and kantowski - sachs models ( theorem 5.1 ) .",
    "these concern both the initial singularity and phases of unlimited expansion .",
    "perhaps the most striking case is that of the initial singularity in the bianchi type ii models , where we find persistent oscillatory behaviour near the singularity .",
    "this is quite different from the known behaviour of type ii perfect fluid models .",
    "our results will also illuminate another matter .",
    "in @xcite lukash and starobinski gave a heuristic analysis of a locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) model of bianchi type i with collisionless matter consisting of massless particles .",
    "their conclusion was that in the expanding direction the model would isotropize so that at large times it would look like a friedman - robertson - walker model .",
    "on the one hand we are able to prove rigorously that the heuristic analysis of @xcite gives the correct result . on the other hand",
    "we show that this result depends essentially on the assumption of a symmetry of bianchi type i. if this symmetry type is replaced by bianchi type ii ( keeping the lrs assumption and massless collisionless particles ) then the anisotropy tends to a constant non - zero value at large times .",
    "the cosmological models studied in this paper are lrs spatially homogeneous spacetimes with matter described by the vlasov equation for massless particles .",
    "the reason for imposing the lrs condition is that it allows the vlasov equation to be solved explicitly so that the einstein - vlasov equations reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations , albeit with coefficients which are not explicitly known and depend on the chosen initial data .",
    "the reason for choosing the particles to be massless is that this allows a reduction of the system of ode similar to that carried out for perfect fluids with a linear equation of state by wainwright and hsu @xcite .",
    "it has not proved possible to analyse the global behaviour of solutions to our system of ode completely . however a number of partial results have been obtained which show that there is considerable variety in the asymptotic behaviour of solutions near an initial singularity or during a phase of unlimited expansion . in particular , the reflection symmetric lrs bianchi type i solutions with massless particles are analysed completely with respect to their asymptotic behaviour , thus improving markedly on the results obtained on that class of spacetimes in @xcite .    the matter model used in the following",
    "will now be described .",
    "the matter consists of particles of zero rest mass which propagate through spacetime freely without collisions .",
    "each particle is affected by the others only by the gravitational field which they generate collectively .",
    "the wordline of each particle is a null geodesic .",
    "each geodesic has a natural lift to the tangent bundle of spacetime .",
    "thus the geodesic equation defines a flow on the tangent bundle . by means of the metric this may if desired be transported to the cotangent bundle and here it will be convenient to do so .",
    "the subset of the cotangent bundle consisting of all covectors obtained by lowering the index of future - pointing null vectors , which will be denoted by @xmath0 , is invariant under the flow and thus the flow may be restricted to it .",
    "the basic matter field used to describe the collisionless particles is a non - negative real - valued function @xmath1 on @xmath0 which represents the density of particles with given position and momentum at a given time .",
    "choosing appropriate coordinates @xmath2 on spacetime and letting @xmath3 be the corresponding coordinates on the cotangent bundle , the manifold @xmath0 can be coordinatized by @xmath4 . here",
    "the convention is used that greek and roman indices run from @xmath5 to @xmath6 and @xmath7 to @xmath6 respectively .",
    "we write @xmath8 for @xmath9 and it is assumed that @xmath8 increases towards the future .",
    "the field equation for @xmath1 , the vlasov equation , says geometrically that @xmath1 is constant along the geodesic flow . in the coordinates",
    "just introduced its explicit form is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is to be determined from @xmath12 by the relation @xmath13 and indices are raised and lowered using the spacetime metric @xmath14 and its inverse . in order to couple the vlasov equation to the einstein equation",
    ", it is necessary to define the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "it is given by @xmath15 in fact for bianchi models it is more useful to replace the coordinate components of the momentum used in these equations by components in a suitable frame .",
    "the only change in the equations is that the christoffel symbols in the vlasov equation are replaced by the connection coefficients in the given frame . for more information about the vlasov equation in general relativity",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "spatially homogeneous spacetimes fall into three broad classes , known as bianchi class a , bianchi class b and kantowski - sachs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "each of the two bianchi classes can be further divided into bianchi types .",
    "a spatially homogeneous spacetime in one of the bianchi classes is called locally rotationally symmetric if it has , in addition to the three killing vector fields needed for spatial homogeneity , a fourth one .",
    "this can only happen for certain symmetry types . in class",
    "a the bianchi types which allow an lrs special case are i , ii , vii@xmath16 , viii and ix . in class b it is types iii , v and vii@xmath17 which allow this @xcite .",
    "the kantowski - sachs spacetimes automatically have a fourth killing vector .",
    "there exist solutions of the einstein - vlasov equations with @xmath18 robertson - walker symmetry and these have , in particular , bianchi type v and bianchi type vii@xmath17 symmetry with any non - zero @xmath19 .",
    "we did not attempt to ascertain whether there are other examples of solutions of these bianchi types with lrs symmetry , and these types are not considered further in this paper .",
    "a spatially homogeneous solution of the einstein - vlasov equations has by definition the property that both the geometry and the phase space density of particles are invariant under the group action defining the symmetry type .",
    "a similar remark applies to an additional lrs symmetry",
    ". it would be nice if the invariance of @xmath1 under the group in a bianchi model could be expressed by the condition that @xmath1 depends only on time and momentum when expressed with respect to a left - invariant frame on the group defining the symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , as discussed in @xcite , this does not work in general .",
    "it does work for all lrs bianchi models of class a and type iii and for kantowski - sachs models @xcite .",
    "this is the reason why lrs models are relatively tractable . in the following we consider lrs models which are of kantowski - sachs type , or of bianchi type i , ii , iii , vii@xmath16 , viii or ix .    in the next section",
    "it is shown how in the class of spacetimes of interest the einstein - vlasov equations with given initial data can be reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "in fact two systems are needed .",
    "the first includes the solutions of types i , ii , vii@xmath16 , viii and ix while the second includes those of types i and iii and the kantowski - sachs models . note that the solutions of type i are represented in both systems and understanding the bianchi i case is central to analysing the general case .",
    "the analysis of the bianchi i system is carried out in the third section .",
    "this is then used in sections 4 and 5 to obtain results on the first and second systems of ode respectively . in the last section",
    "the results are summarized and their wider significance is examined .",
    "an appendix collects together some results from the theory of dynamical systems used in the body of the paper .",
    "in a spacetime with bianchi symmetry the metric can be written in the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a left - invariant coframe on the lie group @xmath22 which defines the symmetry .",
    "the particular bianchi type is determined by the structure constants of the lie algebra of @xmath22 .",
    "the extra symmetry which is present in the lrs case implies that the metric @xmath23 is diagonal , with two of the diagonal elements being equal @xcite .",
    "thus ( [ bianchi ] ) simplifies to @xmath24 for two functions @xmath25 and @xmath26 of one variable .",
    "if @xmath27 is any killing vector field then the function @xmath28 on the cotangent bundle is constant along geodesics and hence satisfies the vlasov equation .",
    "any function of quantities of this type for different killing vectors also satisfies the vlasov equation .",
    "the killing vectors on a spacetime with bianchi symmetry include those defined by right - invariant vector fields on the lie group @xmath22 but the result of evaluating a left - invariant one - form on one of these is not in general constant .",
    "thus we can not simply solve the vlasov equation by choosing an arbitrary function of the components @xmath29 with respect to a left - invariant basis .",
    "however for the lrs spacetimes of bianchi class a or type iii considered here a function of the form @xmath30 does satisfy the vlasov equation and in fact is the most general solution with the full lrs symmetry @xcite . here",
    "@xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the components of the momentum in the coframe @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath1 does not depend explicitly on time in this representation , the function @xmath34 can be identified with the initial datum for the solution of the vlasov equation at a fixed time .",
    "a similar statement holds for kantowski - sachs spacetimes .",
    "the metric can be written in the form ( [ lrs ] ) where @xmath35 is invariant under the symmetry group and @xmath36 and @xmath37 make up any ( locally defined ) orthonormal coframe on the two - sphere .",
    "the expression @xmath38 is not changed by a change in orthonormal coframe and so it makes sense to consider the above form of @xmath1 in terms of @xmath34 in kantowski - sachs spacetimes as well .",
    "if @xmath1 is of this form it satisfies the vlasov equation .",
    "thus the vlasov equation has been solved explicitly in the class of spacetimes to be studied .",
    "it remains to determine the form of the einstein equations .",
    "in fact , one further restriction will be imposed .",
    "the distribution function given above is automatically an even function of @xmath32 and @xmath33 . however it need not be even in @xmath31 . if it is even in @xmath31 we say , as in @xcite , that the solution is reflection symmetric .",
    "only reflection symmetric solutions will be considered in the following . for convenience",
    "we say that a function of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 which depends only on @xmath31 and @xmath38 and which is even in @xmath31 has special form .",
    "if the einstein equations are split as usual into constraints and evolution equations then it turns out that in this class of spacetimes the momentum constraint is automatically satisfied . only the hamiltonian constraint and the evolution equations",
    "the former is an algebraic relation between @xmath39 , @xmath40 and their time derivatives @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the latter provide ordinary differential equations for the evolution of @xmath39 and @xmath40 which are second order in time",
    ". it will be convenient to write these equations in terms of some alternative variables .",
    "consider first the mean curvature of the homogeneous hypersurfaces : @xmath43\\ ] ] a new time coordinate @xmath44 can be defined by @xmath45 for some arbitrary fixed time @xmath46 . in the following a dot over a quantity denotes its derivative with respect to @xmath44 . now",
    "define : @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 will be @xmath50 , @xmath5 or @xmath7 , depending on the symmetry type considered .",
    "the variables @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are closely related to the variables of the same names used by wainwright and hsu @xcite .",
    "( note that we adopt the conventions of @xcite rather than those of @xcite , which differ by a factor of three in some places . )",
    "two systems of ode will now be considered , which between them are equivalent to the evolution part of the einstein - vlasov equations for all the relevant symmetry types .",
    "the first system is : @xmath54n_1 \\nonumber        \\\\",

    "note that if @xmath73 is replaced by @xmath74 in ( [ bianchia ] ) an almost identical system is obtained , with the sign in the first equation being reversed .",

    "this restricted system will be referred to in the following as the bianchi i system .",
    "it was introduced in section 6 of @xcite with slightly different variables .    if a solution of ( [ bianchia ] ) and a fixed @xmath34 are given , it is possible to construct a spacetime as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath82 is contained in the domain of definition of the solution .",

    "consider now the spacetime which evolves from these initial data .",
    "it is of the form ( [ bianchi ] ) . for the einstein - vlasov system in a spacetime of",
    "the form ( [ bianchi ] ) with a fixed time - independent distribution function is a system of second order ode which has solutions corresponding to data for @xmath89 .",

    "this spacetime defines a solution of ( [ bianchia ] ) via ( [ dimensionless ] ) .",
    "( note that @xmath92 corresponds to @xmath82 . )",
    "thus the two solutions are identical . in this way",
    "a spacetime has been constructed which gives rise to the solution of ( [ bianchia ] ) we started with .",
    "this spacetime may be obtained more explicitly if desired .",

    ". then @xmath59 can be obtained from the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . the definition of @xmath59 in terms of @xmath34",
    "can then be combined with @xmath73 to give @xmath39 and @xmath40 as in ( [ scalefactors ] ) .",
    "finally @xmath8 can be obtained from @xmath94 .",

    "the similarity is particularly great in the case @xmath97 ( radiation fluid ) . in that case",
    "the only difference is that the function @xmath98 should be replaced by the constant value @xmath99 .",
    "this leads to a decoupling of the first equation in each system , so that it is possible to restrict attention to the remaining equations when investigating the dynamics .",
    "( this last remark also applies to the system obtained for other values of @xmath100 . )",
    "the equation for @xmath73 can be integrated afterwards if desired .    in @xcite",
    "it was proved that @xmath98 as defined in ( [ q ] ) tends to zero as @xmath73 tends to zero and that if @xmath101 is defined to be zero the resulting extension of @xmath55 is @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",

    "this last expression is @xmath111 as @xmath112 by lemma 4.2 of @xcite . by using a coordinate @xmath113 it is possible to map the system ( [ bianchia ] ) with @xmath73 ranging from zero to infinity onto a region with @xmath114 ranging from zero to one .",
    "moreover the system extends in a @xmath102 manner to the boundary components @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath114 has been introduced purely to demonstrate that the system ( [ bianchia ] ) can be smoothly compactified in the @xmath73-direction . for computations",
    "it is more practical to use the local coordinates @xmath73 and @xmath117 . in particular , these considerations allow us to regard the bianchi i system as being defined on a compact set .",
    "the compactification of the system ( [ bianchia ] ) is defined on a region with boundary .",
    "different parts of the boundary are given by @xmath115 , @xmath116 and the case of equality in ( [ physical ] ) .",
    "the complement of the boundary will be called the interior region in the following . a solution which lies in the interior region corresponds to a smooth non - vacuum solution of the einstein - vlasov equations . a solution which lies in the part of the boundary where ( [ physical ] )",
    "becomes an equality corresponds to a solution of the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "a solution which lies in the part of the boundary given by @xmath115 or @xmath116 corresponds to a distributional solution of the einstein - vlasov equations , as will be explained in more detail below .",
    "the system ( [ surfacesymm ] ) can be compactified in a way very similar to that taken in the case of ( [ bianchia ] ) .",
    "the comments on the interpretation of different types of solutions of the compactification of ( [ bianchia ] ) just made also apply to the compactification of ( [ surfacesymm ] ) , with ( [ physical ] ) being replaced by ( [ physicalsurf ] ) .",
    "consider now the stationary points of the system ( [ bianchia ] ) , or rather of its compactification .",
    "( this distinction will not always be made explicitly in what follows . ) in section 4 it will be shown that all stationary points where @xmath73 has a finite non - zero value belong to the subset @xmath62 corresponding to solutions of type i. in particular , they correspond to stationary points of the bianchi i system , which will be studied in detail in the next section .",
    "it turns out that the bianchi i system plays a central role in the dynamics of solutions of the systems ( [ bianchia ] ) and ( [ surfacesymm ] ) . in this section the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of this system",
    "is determined , both for @xmath118 ( approach to the singularity ) and for @xmath119 ( unlimited expansion ) .",
    "the first step in analysing the bianchi i system is to determine the stationary points .",

    "@xmath129 is to be interpreted as @xmath107 or @xmath116 .",

    "recall that a stationary point is called hyperbolic if none of its eigenvalues are purely imaginary . in the following we call a stationary point degenerate if it is not hyperbolic .",
    "the point @xmath131 is a hyperbolic sink while @xmath132 is a hyperbolic source .",
    "the points @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are hyperbolic saddles while @xmath136 is degenerate , with one zero eigenvalue .",

    "* theorem 3.1 * if a smooth non - vacuum reflection - symmetric lrs solution of bianchi type i of the einstein - vlasov equations for massless particles is represented as a solution of ( [ bianchia ] ) with @xmath137 then for @xmath119 it converges to the point @xmath131 . for @xmath138",
    "either    \\(i ) it converges to @xmath131 and in that case it stays for all time at the point @xmath131 or ( ii ) it converges to the point @xmath134 and it belongs to the unstable manifold of @xmath134 or ( iii ) it converges to @xmath132 all of these cases occur , and ( iii ) is the generic case in the sense that it occurs for an open dense set of initial data .",
    "this will be proved in a series of lemmas .",

    "a solution of the bianchi i system in the interior has no @xmath140-limit points with @xmath141 .    * proof * a solution of the bianchi i system satisfies @xmath142 when @xmath139 and so for any solution which enters the given region , @xmath53 is nondecreasing towards the past and it is in the region for all earlier times .",
    "if @xmath53 did not tend to @xmath7 as @xmath138 then we would have @xmath143 at early times , a contradiction .",
    "once we know that @xmath144 as @xmath138 it follows immediately that @xmath145 .",
    "thus the solution converges to @xmath132 .",
    "consider now the forward time direction .",
    "since @xmath53 is positive , @xmath73 is increasing .",
    "this means that @xmath55 is increasing .",
    "the inequality @xmath146 for a constant @xmath147 then shows that the solution must leave the region of interest in finite time , so that there can be no @xmath140-limit point with @xmath141 .    for convenience",
    "an interior solution which does not tend to @xmath132 as @xmath138 will be called exceptional .",
    "thus lemma 3.1 says that an exceptional solution can not intersect the region @xmath139 .    * lemma 3.2 * the @xmath148-limit set of an exceptional solution can not intersect the boundary at any point except @xmath134 .",
    "if it does intersect the boundary at @xmath134 it belongs to case ( ii ) of theorem 3.1 as @xmath138 .",

    "if @xmath129 then the whole orbit passing through that point belongs to the @xmath148-limit set .",
    "this implies that the solution must intersect the region @xmath149 , a contradiction .",
    "thus in fact @xmath150 .",
    "if @xmath151 then all points with @xmath151 must be in the @xmath148-limit set , in particular @xmath136 . by lemma a2 of the appendix , it follows that a point of the centre manifold of @xmath136 lies in the @xmath148-limit set .",
    "however , this centre manifold is given by @xmath129 and so we again obtain a contradiction . hence @xmath152 .",
    "if @xmath104 and @xmath153 then all points satisfying these conditions must be in the @xmath148-limit set , in particular @xmath133 .",
    "but then an application of lemma a1 of the appendix leads to a contradiction .",
    "thus no point on the boundary other than @xmath134 is possible .",
    "a further application of lemma a1 shows that in this case the solution must lie on the unstable manifold of @xmath134 . in a similar way it is possible to show that if any point of the boundary belonged to the @xmath140-limit set of an interior solution then some point with @xmath139 would do so .",
    "however we know from lemma 3.1 that this is impossible .",
    "* proof of theorem 3.1 * first the poincar - bendixson theorem will be applied to the restriction of the bianchi i system to the interior with the point @xmath131 removed . in general the @xmath148- and @xmath140-limit sets of an orbit of a dynamical system can be very complicated , but in two dimensions ( and the bianchi i system is two - dimensional ) things are a lot simpler .",
    "complicated situations are still possible and these play an important role in hilbert s sixteenth problem ( see e.g. @xcite , p. 104 ) .",
    "however many pathologies are ruled out by the poincar - bendixson theorem , which is stated in the appendix ( theorem a2 ) .    given an interior solution , suppose that @xmath131 does not belong to the @xmath140-limit set . by lemma 3.2 no point of the boundary belongs to the @xmath140-limit set either . since @xmath131 is a hyperbolic sink it follows that there must be a neighbourhood of @xmath131 which does not intersect the @xmath140-limit set .",
    "thus the solution remains in a compact set of the interior with the point @xmath131 removed as @xmath119 .",
    "then theorem a2 implies the existence of a non - stationary periodic orbit of the bianchi i system .",

    "* theorem 5.2 * if a smooth non - vacuum reflection symmetric lrs solution of bianchi type iii of the einstein - vlasov equations for massless particles is represented as a solution of ( [ surfacesymm ] ) with @xmath79 then for @xmath268 it converges to the the point @xmath269 with coordinates @xmath270 and for @xmath138 either    \\(i ) it converges to @xmath131 or ( ii ) it converges to the point @xmath134 and it belongs to the unstable manifold of @xmath134 or ( iii ) it converges to @xmath132 all of these cases occur , and ( iii ) is the generic case in the sense that it occurs for an open dense set of initial data .",
    "* proof * the inequality ( [ physicalsurf ] ) with @xmath79 implies that a solution of ( [ surfacesymm ] ) of bianchi type iii remains in a compact set and hence exists globally in @xmath44 .",
    "the quantity @xmath271 is positive in the region where @xmath272 . call this region @xmath22 . in the complement of the closure of @xmath22 the inequality @xmath273 holds .",
    "thus any stationary point with @xmath274 must lie on the boundary of @xmath22 . a stationary point with a finite non - zero value of @xmath73",
    "must satisfy @xmath275 and this implies that @xmath276 , a contradiction .",
    "thus the only stationary points occur for @xmath266 ( these are the well - known bianchi type i stationary points ) , @xmath104 or @xmath129 .",
    "in fact the only stationary points which are not of type i are those with coordinates @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",
    "call these @xmath279 and @xmath269 respectively ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "+ the boundary of @xmath22 is connected and so @xmath280 has a constant sign there .",
    "checking at one point shows that this sign is positive . as a consequence ,",
    "a solution can never leave @xmath22 as @xmath44 increases or enter @xmath22 as @xmath44 decreases . a solution which lies on the boundary of @xmath22 at some time ( with @xmath73 non - zero and finite )",
    "must immediately enter @xmath22 to the future and enter the interior of its complement to the past .",
    "consider now the behaviour of a given solution as @xmath44 decreases . if it stayed in @xmath22 for ever then @xmath250 would have to increase as @xmath44 decreases .",
    "on the other hand , any @xmath148-limit point would have to be in the boundary of @xmath22 due to the monotonicity properties of @xmath250 .",
    "this is not consistent .",
    "thus as @xmath44 decreases the solution must reach the boundary of @xmath22 and , as a consequence the interior of the complement of @xmath22 . in the latter region @xmath250",
    "is strictly monotone and so the @xmath148-limit set must be contained in @xmath266 .",
    "then the same analysis as in the proof of theorem 5.1 shows that the solution belongs to one of the cases ( i)-(iii ) of the theorem .",
    "next consider the behaviour as @xmath44 increases .",
    "as @xmath44 tends to infinity the solution must tend to the boundary of @xmath22 .",
    "if it stays in the interior of the complement of @xmath22 then it must tend to the boundary of @xmath22 as @xmath44 tends to infinity and , more precisely , to one of the points @xmath279 or @xmath269 .",
    "since @xmath53 is positive at these points , @xmath281 and so only @xmath269 is possible .",
    "now suppose that the solution does meet the boundary of @xmath22 and hence enters @xmath22 itself .",
    "then it remains in @xmath22 and @xmath250 is once again strictly monotone .",
    "as before , it can be concluded that the solution converges to @xmath269 as @xmath119 .",
    "space and the fixed points for bianchi type iii.,width=377,height=302 ]    [ figure 3 ]    the point @xmath269 corresponds to a self - similar solution of the vacuum einstein equations much as does @xmath172 ( this time the trajectory is the horizontal straight line in figure 3 from @xmath279 to @xmath269 ) .",
    "this is the bianchi iii form of flat space ( see p. 193 of @xcite ) .",
    "once again the nature of the initial singularity is similar to that in solutions of type i. on the other hand the final singularity is qualitatively different from any we have seen so far . in this case",
    "the solution is approximated at large times by a vacuum solution in the sense that the dimensionless quantity @xmath282 tends to zero as @xmath283 .",
    "a very similar analysis applies to the system for a radiation fluid .",
    "lrs bianchi type iii fluid solutions with equation of state @xmath284 behave like solutions of bianchi type i near the initial singularity .",
    "they are approximated at large times by the same vacuum solution as in the case of kinetic theory .",
    "the approach of @xcite should allow similar statements to be proved for other fluids with a linear equation of state , but this does not seem to have been worked out explicitly in the literature .",
    "the above theorems show that solutions of the einstein - vlasov equations with high symmetry exhibit a wide variety of asymptotic behaviour near a singularity and in a phase of unlimited expansion .",
    "they can have a point singularity , barrel singularity or cigar singularity or they can show oscillatory behaviour near a singularity . in an expanding phase they can resemble a fluid solution ( bianchi type i and vii@xmath16 ) , a vacuum solution ( bianchi type iii ) or a solution of the einstein equations with null dust ( bianchi type ii )",
    ". there are notable differences in comparison with a fluid model , and this includes the radiation fluid , which is often used as an effective model of massless particles in cosmology .",
    "the most striking qualitative difference is the appearance of oscillatory behaviour in type ii solutions .",
    "it is interesting to compare this with the analysis of spacetime singularities by belinskii , khalatnikov and lifschitz @xcite .",
    "they do not say precisely what they assume about matter but it seems that they do assume , at least implicitly , that pressures can not approach the energy density .",
    "this assumption is not necessarily satisfied in a kinetic description .",
    "the mean pressure can not exceed one third of the energy density but if it all concentrates in one direction the pressure in that direction can approach the energy density .",
    "this leads to a source of oscillations beyond those taken into account in @xcite .    while the oscillatory behaviour of cosmological models near a singularity has often been observed numerically and explained heuristically , it has rarely been captured in rigorous theorems . to our knowledge",
    "the only example where this had been done previous to theorem 4.2 of this paper is in a class of solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations of bianchi type vi@xmath16 analysed in @xcite .    the results of this paper concern only massless particles .",
    "one may ask what would change in the results if the case of massive particles is considered . in one case",
    "the answer is known , namely in bianchi type i. there the solution approaches a dust solution in the expanding phase .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that this happens more generally . as the model expands in all directions the pressures should become negligible with respect to the energy density , leading to a dust - like situation .",
    "however , the techniques necessary to prove this are not yet known . near the initial singularity",
    ", the equations for massive particles look like those for massless particles and it may be conjectured that the behaviour near the singularity is similar in both cases .",
    "unfortunately that has also not yet been proved .",
    "it is interesting to note that matter seems to have the effect of making the evolution of the geometry under the einstein equations less extreme in a phase of unlimited expansion . in bianchi type",
    "i the vacuum solutions ( kasner solutions ) are such that some spatial direction is contracting or unchanging in the expanding time direction ( the time direction in which the volume is increasing ) .",
    "this is no longer the case when perfect fluid or kinetic matter is added , since then the model isotropizes . in type",
    "ii there is no complete isotropization but it is still the case that with fluid or kinetic matter all directions are eventually expanding , in contrast to the vacuum case . the type iii case is borderline , since there solutions with collisionless matter are asymptotic , in the sense of the variables used in this paper , to a vacuum solution in the expanding time direction .",
    "the vacuum solution is such that the scale factor @xmath40 is time independent . in the other lrs bianchi type iii vacuum",
    "spacetimes this scale factor is asymptotically constant as @xmath283 and for a radiation fluid this is also the case ( cf .",
    "@xcite p. 203 ) .",
    "on the other hand for dust models which also converge to the same vacuum model in terms of the wainwright - hsu variables , this scale factor grows without bound , although much more slowly than the other scale factors ( @xcite , p. 202 ) .",
    "it is difficult to decide what happens in the case of collisionless matter with massless particles , since the point @xmath269 is a degenerate stationary point of the system ( [ surfacesymm ] ) . in the corresponding system for a radiation fluid",
    "the point with these coordinates is also a stationary point but is non - degenerate .    for the einstein - vlasov equations with massless particles the lrs reflection symmetric solutions of bianchi types i",
    ", ii , iii , vii@xmath16 and kantowski - sachs type have now been analysed as far as to give a full description of their general behaviour near the singularity and in a phase of unlimited expansion .",
    "there are still plenty of open questions related to this .",
    "what happens with lrs solutions of types viii and ix ? what happens if reflection symmetry is dropped ?",
    "does this lead to a new kind of oscillatory behaviour ? what happens if the lrs condition is dropped ?",
    "( this is still open even in the bianchi i case . )",
    "can the hamiltonian formulation of the equations , which played an important role at one point in our arguments , usefully be applied in some of these more general cases ?",
