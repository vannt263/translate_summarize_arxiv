    "an extragalactic gravitational lens system ( gls ) forms several images of a single quasar .",
    "the light from the quasar intersects a lensing galaxy in different regions which correspond to different images .",
    "variations of gravitational fields in these regions due to stellar motions are practically independent and lead to independent brightness variations in different images ( gravitational microlensing ) .",
    "comparison of the light curves of different images allows one to obtain a valuable information about the lens itself and about the source as well @xcite .",
    "one of the important applications of this effect deals with a unique possibility to study a fine structure of the central quasar region with the use of gls .",
    "this idea first proposed by appeals to the high amplification events ( haes ) in one of the images of the quasar in gls .",
    "an interesting applications of haes are known also in galactic microlensing ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , in particular , using the caustic crossing events for resolving of stellar profiles @xcite .",
    "the conventional explanation of hae relates it to the caustic field in the source plane formed due to the inhomogeneous gravitational field of a lensing galaxy on the line of sight of the image @xcite .",
    "the source crossing of a caustic leads to a considerable enhancement of the image brightness , the crossing of a fold caustic being the most probable .",
    "the corresponding variations of the brightness in a neighborhood of hae can be approximately described by a formula containing a few fitting parameters .",
    "this makes it possible to estimate certain hae characteristics , in particular , such as the source size @xcite .",
    "for example , in the case of the well - known q2237 + 0305 gls ( einstein cross ) , several haes was observed @xcite , and the estimates of the source size have been obtained within different source models @xcite .",
    "almost all haes in the q2237 + 0305 gls are attributed just to a fold caustic crossing in the source plane ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . a possibility to distinguish different source models",
    "is also discussed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the lens equation near a fold can be expanded in powers of local coordinates ; in the lowest orders of this expansion , the caustic is represented by a straight line ; so , this approximation is often referred as a `` linear caustic approximation '' . in this approximation ,",
    "the point source flux amplification is given by a simple formula , which depends on the distance to the caustic and contains two parameters ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . in most cases , the linear caustic approximation is sufficient to fit the observed light curves over the range of haes at the modern accuracy of flux measurements . the need for a modification of this formula ",
    "e.g. , by taking the caustic curvature into account  is , nevertheless , being discussed for a long time @xcite .",
    "we hope that the future improvement of the photometric accuracy will make it possible to obtain additional parameters of the lens mapping , which are connected with the mass distribution in the lensing galaxy . at the same time",
    ", we will show that the consideration of `` post - linear '' terms is sometimes appropriate to explain the present observational data .",
    "we note that the corrections to the amplification factor in the case of macrolensing were the subject of investigations dealing with the problem of `` anomalous flux ratios '' @xcite .    since the work by @xcite followed by a number of works @xcite , numerous statistical methods have been developed to process complete light curves .",
    "this approach is very attractive because it allows one to consider the whole aggregate of observational data on image brightness variations in order to estimate the microlens masses and the source model parameters .",
    "however , this treatment involves a large number of realizations of the microlensing field , which requires a considerable computer time . on the other hand ,",
    "the source structure manifests itself only in haes ; far from the caustic , the source looks like a point one , and all the information about its structure is lost .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to the hae neighborhood , then we use the most general model concerning a microlensing field described by a small collection of taylor coefficients in the lens mapping .",
    "therefore , the low - time - consuming semi - analytical investigations dealing with caustic neighborhoods still preserve their importance , not speaking about their use in computer codes .    in this paper",
    ", we propose relations for the total magnification of two critical images of a point source in the first nontrivial `` post - linear '' approximations and use them to modify the magnification of an extended source near the fold caustic . in order to obtain non - zero corrections to the total amplification of two critical images",
    ", we have to consider additional higher - order terms in the expansion of the lens mapping in comparison with the earlier works ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "though the corrections are expected to be small , they appear to be noticeable in some cases even in an analysis of the existing data on light curves in the q2237 + 0305 gls .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : after the derivation of approximate solutions of the lens equation in the required order , we deduce a formula for the magnification of a point source .",
    "the result is used to obtain the magnification of a small gaussian source near the fold caustic .",
    "we use the formula for the amplification of an extended source to fit the light curves in gls q2237 + 0305 .",
    "the obtained post - linear corrections appear to improve the agreement with observational data .",
    "appendices  [ a ] and [ b ] contain details on the approximation methods involved .",
    "power - law source models are considered in appendix  [ c ] .",
    "explicit comparison of our approximate formulas with counterparts from the paper by @xcite is made in appendix  [ d ] .",
    "first , we recall some general notions concerning the gravitational lensing that can be found , e.g. , in the book by @xcite .",
    "the normalized lens equation has the form :    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the lens potential .",
    "this equation relates every point @xmath3 of the image plane to the point @xmath4 of the source plane . in the general case ,",
    "there are several solutions @xmath5 of the lens equation ( [ eq1 ] ) that represent images of one point source at @xmath6 ; we denote the solution number by the index in parentheses .",
    "if there is no continuous matter on the line of sight , the potential must be a harmonic function @xmath7 .",
    "below , we will assume that this condition is fulfilled in a neighborhood of the critical point .",
    "we note , however , that if the continuous matter density is supposedly constant during hae , this can be taken into account by a suitable rescaling of the variables .",
    "the amplification of a separate image of a point source is    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the jacobian of the lens mapping . in the microlensing processes ,",
    "microimages can not be observed separately ; therefore , we need the total amplification which is a sum of the amplification coefficients of all the images .    the critical curves of the lens mapping  ( [ eq1 ] ) are determined by the equation @xmath10 and are mapped onto the caustics in the source plane .",
    "the stable critical points of a two - dimensional mapping can be folds and cusps only , the folds being more probable in hae . in this paper , we confine ourselves to the consideration of fold caustics .",
    "when a point source approaches the fold caustic from its convex side , two of its images approach the critical curve , and their magnification tends to infinity .",
    "they disappear when the source crosses the caustic .",
    "these two images are called critical .    the standard consideration of the caustic crossing events deals with the taylor expansion of the potential near some point @xmath11 of the critical curve in the image plane .",
    "let this point be the coordinate origin .",
    "we suppose that ( [ eq1 ] ) maps @xmath11 onto the coordinate origin of the source plane .",
    "further , we rotate synchronously the coordinate systems until the abscissa axis on the source plane be tangent to the caustic at the origin .",
    "the quantity @xmath12 defines locally the distance to the caustic , and @xmath13 defines a displacement along the tangent . for the harmonic potential , we can write    @xmath14    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are expansion coefficients . if the @xmath18 axis is directed toward the convexity of the caustic , then @xmath19 ( at fold points , @xmath20 ) .",
    "we now proceed to the derivation of approximate solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) . to do this",
    ", we present two different methods which will be used to have a possibility of mutual checks of cumbersome calculations .",
    "the first method deals with analytical expansions in powers of a small parameter . however , it results in nonanalytic functions of coordinates leading to nonintegrable terms in the amplification factor .",
    "the second method does not lead to such problems , though it uses a somewhat more complicated representation of the solution of the lens equation ( containing square roots of analytic functions ) .",
    "the methods agree with each other in a common domain of validity ; moreover , we use the second method to justify some expressions in the amplification formulas in terms of distributions to validate applications to extended source models .",
    "first , we use a regular procedure proposed by @xcite to construct solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) with a desired accuracy .",
    "this procedure is useful to study the light curve of the point source which has a trajectory crossing the fold caustic at some nonzero angle .",
    "we suppose that the source and the caustic lie on different sides from the @xmath13 axis .",
    "then , for @xmath21 , we substitute    @xmath22    where @xmath23 , and @xmath24 can be considered as a parameter of vicinity to the caustic .",
    "this is a formal substitution that makes easier operations with different orders of the expansion . after performing calculations",
    ", we shall put @xmath25 and thus return to the initial variables @xmath26 .",
    "however , if we put @xmath27 to be constant with varying @xmath24 , then this substitution allows us to study a local behaviour of critical image trajectories ; @xmath28 corresponds to crossing the caustic by a point source , and @xmath29 can be considered as the time counted from the moment , when two critical images appear .",
    "indeed , one can show @xcite that two critical solutions @xmath30 of the lens equation can be represented by analytic functions of @xmath24 that , in the above special coordinate system , have the behaviour @xmath31 , @xmath32 ( see appendix  [ a ] ) .",

    "if the source is on the caustic tangent or in the region between the caustic and the tangent , then formula  ( [ point amplification ] ) does not represent a good approximation to the point source magnification . nevertheless , in case of an extended source",
    ", we will show that result  ( [ point amplification ] ) can be used to obtain approximations to the amplification of this source even as it intersects the caustic .",

    "( solid line ) . ]    to sum up , the model @xmath152 fits satisfactorily the data on hae in question within the present accuracy , though we can not rule out competing models and/or competing effects .",
    "we also analysed hae in the light curve of image q2237 + 0305a that happened in 1999 @xcite .",
    "however , the treatment of this hae does not allowed us to find statistically significant estimates of the corrections because of lacking the data corresponding to the caustic inner region .",
    "we proposed two methods that enabled us to obtain the critical solutions of the gravitational lens equation near a fold caustic with any desired accuracy .",
    "the first method is based on the expansion of the solutions and the amplification factor @xmath163 of two critical images of a point source in powers of a formal parameter @xmath24 that can be interpreted as a parameter describing the proximity to the caustic .",
    "we derived a representation of @xmath163 which is convenient to obtain the amplification factor for an extended source .",
    "this representation is not analytic in local coordinates , and @xmath163 contains a nonintegrable term . in order to elucidate this term",
    ", we considered a different representation of the solutions which contains analytic functions of coordinates and the parameter @xmath24 , as well as square roots of such functions .",
    "this method yields only integrable expressions and explains the meaning of the nonintegrable term in @xmath163 : it should be considered as a distribution which can be used to calculate the amplification of a small ( and smooth ) extended source near the fold caustic by taking the appropriate convolution .    in order to obtain nontrivial corrections to @xmath74 , we had to use higher orders of the expansion of the lens equation as compared to works by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the cancellation of terms @xmath164 which are present in the amplifications of separate critical images .",
    "therefore , we had to deal with terms of the order @xmath165 and the taylor expansion including the 4-th order in the lens equation ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "the modified formula for @xmath163 contains 3 extra parameters that are combinations of 5 coefficients of the taylor expansion ( we confined ourselves to the case of no continuous matter on the line of sight ) .    based on our result concerning @xmath74 , we derived an asymptotic formula for the amplification @xmath87 of a small gaussian source .",
    "we analysed the role of new `` post - linear '' corrections and formulated the conditions of applicability of the linear caustic approximation .",
    "the fitting of the light curve of gls q2237 + 0305c shows that some of these corrections can be statistically significant .    of course , we are far from the thought that the available observational data make it possible to determine all additional parameters simultaneously ( and even more so , the coefficients of the expansion of the lens mapping up to the orders involved ) .",
    "such a determination requires a considerable improvement of the photometric accuracy in the future .",
    "our result is more modest : we have shown that , even at the present level of accuracy , some elements of the light curves require to consider the higher - order terms in the solutions of the lens equation .",
    "at least , after the introduction of some post - linear corrections , @xmath0 decreases by 30 per cent thus approaching 1 .",
    "one may hope that an enhancement of the observational accuracy will increase the role of post - linear approximations .    in this connection",
    ", we note that , besides estimating the source size in gls on the basis of light curves , a number of authors @xcite discussed some delicate questions concerning a fine quasar structure . for example , @xcite wrote that the glitp data @xcite on gls q2237 + 0305 admit only accretion disc models ( see also @xcite ) . obviously , the presence of an accretion disk in a central region of quasar is beyond any doubts , as well as the fact that the real appearance of the quasar core can be quite different from very simplified theoretical models in question . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite argue that the accretion disk can be modelled with any brightness profile ( gaussian , uniform , etc . ) , and this model will agree with the available data provided that an appropriate source size is chosen . anyway , in these considerations , different effects come into play , and the consistent treatment requires to consider all the corrections to the amplification including those obtained in the present paper .",
