    "models with @xmath0 symmetry have emerged as an interesting extension of conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "there is a large class of models that are not hermitian , but nevertheless have real spectra as a consequence of @xmath0-symmetry .",
    "bender and boettcher have shown that single - component quantum mechanical models with @xmath0-symmetric potentials of the form @xmath6 have real spectra @xcite .",
    "an extensive literature on @xmath0-symmetry and related matters now exists , and there are extensive review articles available @xcite . most of the results have been for models without continuous internal symmetries , but there have been some results on models with @xmath1 symmetry @xcite .",
    "these models are particularly interesting in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "meisinger and ogilvie have shown that a @xmath0-symmetric version of the @xmath7-invariant anharmonic oscillator is isospectral with a hermitian model with an @xmath8 symmetry @xcite .",
    "we study here the properties of this model , using its hermitian form .",
    "the euclidean lagrangian of the @xmath0-symmetric model with @xmath1 symmetry is given by@xmath9-\\frac{g}{n}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}^{2}\\right)^{2 } \\label{eq : euclideanlagrangian}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is positive .",
    "the minus sign in front of @xmath10 would lead to a hamiltonian unbounded from below if the model were hermitian . from the standpoint of @xmath0 symmetry , the interaction term can be considered as a member of a family of @xmath0-invariant interactions@xmath11 which are invariant under @xmath0 symmetry @xcite .",
    "this class of models is well - defined for @xmath12 , and must be defined for @xmath13 by an appropriate analytic continuation of the @xmath14 as necessary . in @xcite , it was shown that this @xmath0-symmetric model is equivalent to a hermitian model with euclidean lagrangian given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a single variable , and @xmath17 is a vector of @xmath18 variables .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath19 is @xmath20 this hermitian form has many remarkable features .",
    "first of all , it has a manifest @xmath8 symmetry associated with rotations of @xmath17 rather than the @xmath1 symmetry of equation  ( [ eq : euclideanlagrangian ] ) . as in the similar case of a @xmath0-symmetric @xmath21 theory of a single variable @xcite",
    ", there is a linear anomaly term which breaks the classical symmetry @xmath22 at order @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath24 field has no quadratic mass term , while the sign of the mass term for the @xmath16 field is opposite the sign of the @xmath25 fields in the original lagrangian . from a naive field - theoretic point of view",
    ", the @xmath17 field is massless at tree level .",
    "there are two important questions we will address .",
    "the first question is the presence or absence of scattering states in this model for any value of @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear that the corresponding classical model has a class of trajectories with finite , continuously varying energies that escape to infinity along paths with @xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless , we will prove that the quantum mechanical model has only bound states with discrete energy levels .",
    "this behavior is similar to that of the quantum - mechanical @xmath27 model .",
    "this model can be derived from the quantum - mechanical reduction of a two - dimensional gauge theory @xcite and was originally thought to be fully ergodic , _",
    "i.e. _ , to have only chaotic motion . this turns out not to be the case @xcite .",
    "simon has shown that the quantum mechanical version of the @xmath28 model has a purely discrete spectrum @xcite . as we will show in section [ sec : simon ] , the arguments of simon can be generalized to show that the @xmath0-symmetric @xmath1 models have discrete spectrum for all finite values of @xmath3 .    the second , more difficult question , concerns the existence and interpretation of the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "we explain the nature of the problem in section iii . in section iv , we show that a simple variational approximation gives us the clues we need to prove that this model has two distinct scaling behaviors in the large-@xmath3 limit , controlled by the dimensionless parameter @xmath4 .",
    "a first - order transition occurs in the large-@xmath3 limit when @xmath29 .",
    "because this is a quantum mechanical system , the phase transition only appears in the strict limit of @xmath30 . for large but finite @xmath31",
    "there is a rapid crossover between the two different scaling behaviors .",
    "section v rederives the results of section iv using the born - oppenheimer approximation , which proves to be exact in the large-@xmath3 limit . in section",
    "vi we present the results of a numerical study of the ground state energy for @xmath32 that confirm our analytical results .",
    "a final section presents our conclusions .",
    "we now turn to the issue of the spectrum for finite @xmath3 . in @xcite , simon gave five arguments for the absence of scattering states in an @xmath27 potential model .",
    "his first , and simplest , argument is based on a lower bound for the hamiltonian@xmath33 using the operator inequality@xmath34 which obviously holds on a harmonic oscillator basis . applying this inequality symmetrically to @xmath25 and @xmath35 , we see that@xmath36.\\ ] ] this",
    "lower bound hamiltonian has only bound states .",
    "this key step then leads via the golden - thompson inequality to the conclusion that @xmath37 has purely discrete spectrum .    applying the same ideas to our hamiltonian",
    ", we see that@xmath38 the specific bounding hamiltonian is not so important ; the crucial feature is that the bounding hamiltonian has only bound states .",
    "this is sufficient to guarantee that @xmath19 has only bound states for all finite values of @xmath3 .",
    "we now consider the large-@xmath3 limit of the model . our naive expectation based on the hermitian @xmath1 model",
    "is that the ground state energy will be proportional to @xmath3 as @xmath30 @xcite . in order to explore this possibility ,",
    "we rescale the lagrangian @xmath39 by @xmath40 to obtain @xmath41 we see that the anomaly term survives in the large-@xmath3 limit , unlike the @xmath0-symmetric matrix case @xcite . after integrating over the @xmath18 @xmath17 fields , we have a large-@xmath3 effective potential @xmath42 for @xmath16:@xmath43 the new term @xmath44 comes from the functional determinant for fluctuations of the @xmath17 fields , and represents the zero - point energy of their quantum fluctuations given a constant value for @xmath16 .",
    "the shape of the potential is controlled by the dimensionless parameter @xmath45 .",
    "figure  [ fig : veff ] shows the effective potential as a function of @xmath16 with @xmath10 set to @xmath46 for three different values of @xmath47 .",
    "we refer to the region where @xmath48 as region i , and the region where @xmath49 as region ii . in region",
    "i , @xmath42 has a global minimum at @xmath26 . for @xmath16 near @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath42 is approximately linear , but with different slopes for @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "this occurs because the zero - point energy of the @xmath17 fields has virtually the same form as the anomaly term .",
    "however , the zero - point energy term respects a discrete , classical @xmath22 symmetry which the anomaly explicitly breaks .",
    "the boundary between regions i and ii is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath42 has two degenerate minima . in region ii , @xmath42 has a global minimum with @xmath53 .",
    "this change in the behavior of the effective potential as @xmath54 is varied is not seen in the corresponding hermitian model @xcite , and naively indicates that the @xmath18 @xmath17 fields are massless modes in region i.     versus @xmath16 for @xmath55 .",
    "three different values of @xmath47 are shown , corresponding to region i , region ii , and the critical point . ]    to understand better the suspect character of the above analysis , it is useful to rederive these results using hyperspherical coordinates @xcite .",
    "this formalism will also be used later in the context of the born - oppenheimer approximation . if we define @xmath56 , the reduced , radial hamiltonian in the sector of angular momentum @xmath57 is @xmath58 where @xmath57 is a non - negative integer .",
    "after rescaling @xmath40 and @xmath59 , we have@xmath60 taking @xmath61 , we see that the ground state energy to leading order in large-@xmath3 is given by minimizing@xmath62\\ ] ] with respect to @xmath63 and @xmath16 . minimizing with respect to @xmath63 , we find@xmath64 and must now minimize@xmath65\\ ] ] which is identical to our previous expression for @xmath42 .",
    "however , we now notice that when @xmath26 , @xmath63 is infinite .",
    "this strongly suggests that our treatment of the large-@xmath3 limit is not valid in region i.",
    "in order to gain analytical insight about the large-@xmath3 behavior of this model , we apply a simple variational approximation using harmonic oscillator ground states .",
    "we assume that the ground state has the form@xmath66=\\psi_{0}\\left(\\sigma\\right)\\prod_{j=1}^{n-1}\\phi_{0}\\left(\\pi_{j}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is a harmonic oscillator ground state of frequency @xmath68 and expected value @xmath69 .",
    "the wave function @xmath70 has frequency @xmath71 and expected value @xmath72 .",
    "we then have the variational inequality @xmath73 where@xmath74 provides an upper bound for all @xmath75 and positive @xmath71 and @xmath68 .",
    "we are free to rescale the variational parameters @xmath75 , @xmath71 , and @xmath68 as we like , and we have considered the class of rescalings of the form @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .",
    "there are two different rescalings with non - trivial behavior in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "if we rescale the variational parameters as @xmath79 , @xmath80 , leaving @xmath68 unchanged , we find after some algebra that the ground state energy in this large-@xmath3 limit is given by minimizing @xmath81.\\ ] ] this in turn reduces to minimizing @xmath82\\ ] ] with respect to @xmath75 .",
    "unsurprisingly , this is equivalent to minimizing our previous expression for the effective potential in the conventional large-@xmath3 limit and is valid in region ii .    a different scaling behavior , which we will show is valid in region i in the next section , is obtained if we perform rescalings @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",
    "this yields a large-@xmath3 limit of the form@xmath86.\\ ] ] minimization of @xmath87 with respect to the three parameters @xmath88 @xmath68 , and @xmath75 leads to the solution @xmath89 numerically , this gives an upper bound on @xmath90 of approximately @xmath91 . as we show below , this variational result is exact in the large-@xmath3 limit in region i.",
    "we now apply the two different scaling behaviors we have found in the previous section to the hamiltonian directly .",
    "if the @xmath16 field is rescaled by @xmath92 , the rescaled hamiltonian is@xmath93 which will turn out to be valid in region ii .",
    "all of the terms in the hamiltonian are of order @xmath3 , except for the kinetic energy term for @xmath16 , which is of order @xmath94 .",
    "this suggests the use of the born - oppenheimer approximation , in which heavy degrees of freedom are treated classically . in this approximation ,",
    "the wave function is written as @xmath95 where @xmath96 satisfies@xmath97u_{ii}\\left(\\vec{\\pi},\\sigma\\right)=\\epsilon_{ii}\\left(\\sigma\\right)u_{ii}\\left(\\vec{\\pi},\\sigma\\right),\\ ] ] describing the @xmath18 @xmath17 fields as harmonic oscillators with frequencies determined by @xmath98 the total energy to leading order in @xmath3 is again the effective potential @xmath42 .",
    "as we have seen , in region ii there is a non - trivial solution for which the rescaled ground state energy @xmath99 has a finite , negative value as @xmath30 . in region",
    "i , we find that @xmath100 as @xmath30 ; the vacuum expectation value of the original , un - rescaled @xmath16 also obeys @xmath101 in this limit as well .",
    "the other rescaling is @xmath102 combined with @xmath103 the rescaled hamiltonian is@xmath104.\\ ] ] with this rescaling , it appears energies will increase with @xmath3 as @xmath105 .",
    "we also see from the kinetic energy term for @xmath16 that the @xmath16 field retains its operator character as @xmath3 goes to infinity , unlike the conventional large-@xmath3 limit obtained in region ii .",
    "we can immediately drop the @xmath106 and @xmath107 terms as irrelevant in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "the relevance of the @xmath17 kinetic field is less clear .",
    "if we again use hyperspherical coordinates for @xmath17 , we find that the effective hamiltonian in the @xmath61 sector can be written for large @xmath3 as@xmath108\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is now the magnitude of the rescaled @xmath17 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath63 has a mass of order @xmath109 , and we again use the born - oppenheimer approximation , this time applied to @xmath63 .",
    "the wave function is written as @xmath110 where @xmath111 satisfies@xmath112u_{i}\\left(\\sigma,\\rho\\right)=\\epsilon_{i}\\left(\\rho\\right)u_{i}\\left(\\sigma,\\rho\\right),\\ ] ] which describes a particle in a harmonic potential .",
    "the ground state energy is @xmath113 .",
    "the energy of the combined system is given by minimizing@xmath114 which gives the ground state energy in the large-@xmath3 limit in region i to be exactly given by@xmath115 which is identical to the result of the variational treatment in section iv .",
    "we now have results for two different large-@xmath3 limits . in one case ,",
    "the ground state energy is proportional to @xmath3 @xmath116.\\ ] ] in the other case , the ground state energy @xmath115 is proportional to @xmath105 and is always positive . if @xmath117 is negative , as it is in region ii , it will be favored over @xmath118 . in region",
    "i , the formula for @xmath117 appears to predict that the ground state energy is zero .",
    "however , this is misleading : it is actually predicting that the ground state energy is not growing linearly with @xmath31 but at some less rapid rate .",
    "this kind of behavior is shown by @xmath118 , and the two expressions are in fact consistent .",
    "if we examine the behavior of the scaled ground state energy @xmath99 in the large-@xmath3 limit , it is zero in region i and negative in region ii . however , the true behavior of @xmath90 in region i is given by @xmath118 .",
    "note that similar considerations apply to the expectation value @xmath119 .",
    "in region i , @xmath119 is decreasing as @xmath120 , while in region ii it is increasing as @xmath121 .    in the large-@xmath3 limit ,",
    "these two behaviors are completely incommensurate , and give rise to a first - order transition at @xmath29 , the boundary between regions i and ii .",
    "however , there can be no phase transition in quantum mechanics for any finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we can understand the behavior of these two solutions for finite but large values of @xmath3 from the effective potential @xmath42 in figure [ fig : veff ] . in the region of parameter space where @xmath4 is close to @xmath5 , @xmath42 has two distinct local minima , and there will be tunneling between these two minima , leading to a small splitting of the ground state energy from that of the first excited state .",
    "this is very similar to the behavior of the double well with a small term linear in the coordinate @xmath25 added . in this case , however , as @xmath3 becomes large , the tunneling between the two minima is suppressed , leading to a first - order transition in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "at @xmath122 . ]    in order to check our large-@xmath3 result in region i , we study numerically the scaling behavior of the ground state energy for the case @xmath32 for large values of @xmath3 .",
    "this value for @xmath54 is in region i , where the ground state energy scales as @xmath105 in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the @xmath54 dependence disappears in this limit in region i , so the case @xmath32 gives the large-@xmath3 behavior throughout this region .",
    "after rescaling the fields by @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the radial hamiltonian @xmath125 is given by @xmath126 clearly , @xmath10 can be set to @xmath46 at @xmath127 with no loss of generality .",
    "different angular momentum sectors do not mix , and we restrict ourselves to the @xmath61 sector .",
    "we have performed a series of variational calculations using a harmonic oscillator basis for both @xmath16 and @xmath63 . in these calculations ,",
    "a finite - dimensional square matrix is formed from the matrix elements of @xmath125 using a suitable basis .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue of this matrix is an upper bound on the ground state energy . for @xmath63 ,",
    "these basis elements were chosen to be solutions of the reduced hamiltonian for the @xmath128-dimensional harmonic oscillator . with the angular frequency scaled to @xmath46 , the general form of a basis function for @xmath63 is @xmath129 $ ] , where @xmath130 is a non - negative integer , and has energy @xmath131 .",
    "basis sets of size @xmath132 were constructed using @xmath133 basis elements for both @xmath16 and @xmath63 .",
    "the optimum values for the angular frequencies associated with @xmath16 and @xmath63 were determined by minimizing the lowest eigenvalue using a nine - element basis .",
    "these angular frequencies were then used with a 36-element basis to estimate the ground state energy . in figure",
    "[ fig : e0-vs - n ] , we plot the 36-element estimate for the ground state energy , scaled by a factor of @xmath134 , versus @xmath3 . we also show a fit of the form@xmath135 although the fit was obtained using the points from @xmath136 to @xmath137 , the agreement with the calculated energies is quite reasonable even at @xmath138 .",
    "the constants obtained from this fit are @xmath139 and @xmath140 , where the errors are estimated from richardson extrapolation and varying the fitting conditions . these estimated errors",
    "do not represent the true systematic errors due , _",
    "e.g. _ , to truncation to a finite basis .",
    "note the excellent agreement of @xmath141 with the exact result @xmath142 .",
    "the @xmath0-symmetric @xmath1 model has been analyzed in a fairly complete way using its dual hermitian form .",
    "the hermitian form of the hamiltonian has classical trajectories of finite energy that escape to infinity , and also @xmath18 variables which are massless in perturbation theory .",
    "nevertheless , the model can be proven to have only discrete energy eigenstates .",
    "there are two distinct large-@xmath3 limits , with incommensurate scaling behavior . for @xmath143 ,",
    "the large-@xmath3 limit is similar in behavior to that of the hermitian @xmath1 model , with a ground state energy depending on @xmath130 and proportional to @xmath3 . for @xmath144 ,",
    "the ground state energy is proportional to @xmath105 , and is independent of @xmath130 throughout this region .",
    "the two regions are separated by a first - order phase transition in the limit @xmath30 .",
    "all of these results were obtained from the dual hermitian form of the original @xmath0-symmetric model .",
    "although it was shown in @xcite that the large-@xmath3 limit of region ii could be obtained from the @xmath0-symmetric form , these arguments do not appear to give the detailed information for region i that can be obtained from the hermitian form .",
    "it would be very desirable to achieve an understanding of this model for both regions using only the @xmath0-symmetric form of the model .",
    "such an understanding might be an important step in constructing @xmath0-symmetric scalar field theories .",
