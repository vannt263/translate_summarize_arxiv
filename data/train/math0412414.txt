    "floer theory of lagrangian intersections has been proved to be a powerful technique in symplectic geometry . also since the `` homological mirror symmetry '' conjecture by kontsevich @xcite",
    ", it has become much more exciting field of mathematics , which yet has a long way to be fully understood .",
    "recently , fukaya , oh , ohta and ono constructed @xmath0-algebra of largrangian submanifold and floer homology in general setting in their beautiful work @xcite .",
    "but the construction is highly non - trivial to overcome several technical problems .",
    "the first problem is the well - definedness of the moduli space of @xmath5-holomorphic discs compatible for all homotopy classes .",
    "it was observed in @xcite , that standard kuranishi perturbation does not produce compatible and transversal moduli space in general .",
    "another problem is that even if moduli spaces of @xmath5-holomorphic discs are well - defined , it does not directly produce @xmath0-algebra since one has to work at the chain level .    in @xcite , yong - geun oh and",
    "the author has explicitly described the moduli space of holomorphic discs in the case of lagrangian torus fibers in toric fano manifolds , and used that information to compute floer cohomology groups .",
    "a combinatorial discription of a fiber whose floer cohomology is non - vanishing was found , and for such a fiber , the floer cohomology was in fact isomorphic to singular cohomology as a module .",
    "it was shown that all of holomorphic discs in these cases are transversal . to compactify the moduli space , we need an additional assumption regarding the behavior of holomorphic spheres on toric fano manifold(see assumption [ assump ] ) . in this paper , we first consider related @xmath0-algebra which is defined transversally .",
    "namely , fiber products with various chains in the lagrangian submanifold @xmath6 in the definition of @xmath0-algebra can be made transversal for the generic choice of chains .",
    "this gives a partial @xmath0-algebra , but products on the cohomology of these @xmath0-algebras are shown to be well - defined .",
    "how to obtain an actual @xmath0-algebra from this partial algebra is an interesting question . with skew - symmetrization in this toric fano case , these partial @xmath0-algebras gives well - defined @xmath4-algebras . on the other hand , recently fukaya has constructed an @xmath0-algebra on derham complex of lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "a computation in toric fano case can be carried out in the derham setting , which will produce actual @xmath0-algebra .",
    "then we show that floer cohomology ring @xmath7 is isomorphic to a clifford algebra @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a symmetric bilinear form .",
    "it is very interesting that the symmetric bilinear form @xmath9 we obtained exactly agrees with the hessian of the superpotential @xmath1 of the mirror landau - ginzburg model studied by hori and vafa @xcite .",
    "( this is related to homological mirror symmetry conjecture between a - model in fano manifolds and @xmath10-model in landau - ginzburg mirror . ) in particular , the floer cohomology of the clifford torus @xmath11 in @xmath2 is isomorphic to the clifford algebra with @xmath12 generators as a ring .",
    "such product structures in the clifford torus @xmath11 in @xmath2 and @xmath13 in @xmath14 have been conjectured by hori and kapustin and li @xcite , recently in general by @xcite from the calculation on b - model side using physical arguments .",
    "mathematical account of the product structure on @xmath10-model side looks plausible considering the paper by orlov @xcite .",
    "we provide two ways of computing the product structure .",
    "first , we provide direct computations exploiting the classification of all holomorphic discs with boundary on @xmath6 by oh and the author ( @xcite ) .",
    "another method is by using an analogue of _ divisor equation _ for discs , which is introduced in section [ divisor ] .",
    "the latter method easily provides the general correspondence between higher derivatives of the superpotential of lg mirror with the higher products of @xmath0(or @xmath4)-algebra of lagrangian submanifold .",
    "this extends the correspondence proved by oh and the author in @xcite that obstruction cochain @xmath15 agrees with the superpotential itself and non - vanishing of floer cohomology corresponds to the critical points of the superpotential @xmath1 .",
    "these @xmath16-products are invariant under the perturbation of an almost complex structure .",
    "we also provide an explicit filtered chain map between singular cochain complex and bott - morse floer complex in the case of torus fibers @xmath6 in toric fano manifolds , which induces an isomorphism in cohomology in case",
    "floer homology is non - vanishing .    _ acknowledgements .",

    "in this section we recall the construction of the @xmath0-algebra of a lagrangian submanifold .",

    "we extend the coefficient ring @xmath43 to @xmath46 .",
    "then we set @xmath47 since we consider the elements in the image of @xmath45 , if the image of the map @xmath48 of the geometric chain @xmath35 $ ] is smaller than expected dimension , then it gives 0 as a current .",
    "this fact will be used crucially later on . also , note that the map @xmath45 is not injective ,",
    "hence some elements get identified under the map @xmath45 .",
    "also note that we take the whole image of @xmath45 ( instead of taking a countable subset of it ) as transversality of fiber products in the definition of @xmath49 is achieved by choosing generic chains .",

    "also , the fiber products defined above are not always transversal , and we discuss this issue in section [ sec : trans ]    here we recall the dimension formula of @xmath78 when the involved fiber product is transversal .",
    "[ dim ] for non - zero @xmath60 , when transversal , @xmath79    these @xmath80 maps satisfy the @xmath81 formulas ( [ aiformula ] ) for transversal sequence of of chains in @xmath34 .",
    "this is essentially the theorem proved in @xcite .",
    "we recall its proof for the convenience of readers and explain the changes made for @xmath51 .    for simplicity , we recall the proof the only the third @xmath0-formula .",
    "consider the moduli space of j - holomorpic discs intersecting chains @xmath82 and @xmath9 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath83    now , we consider all possible stable map compactification of this moduli space and its image under the evaluation map .",

    "but if transversalities are satisfied for such singular strata with positivity assumptions on lagrangain submanifold , such strata should be of codimension 2 or more , hence they do not contribute to the @xmath0 formulas .",
    "now , these limit configurations can be written into an @xmath0-formula up to sign : @xmath86 @xmath87    this is the third @xmath0-formula in ( [ aiformula ] ) up to sign , and other formulas can be obtained in a similar fashion by choosing a @xmath88 for general @xmath31 in ( [ big ] ) .",
    "now we justify the changes made in the definitions of @xmath89 for @xmath57 .",
    "consider one of the @xmath90 term appeared in the above configuration when @xmath91 , or generally one may consider the geometric chain @xmath92 .",
    "the dimension of the image under the evaluation map of @xmath93 is always smaller than the virtual dimension of the moduli space : the reason is that evaluation map of a constant disc forgets the moduli parameter .",
    "namely , before evaluation , there is a parameter describing the position of four marked points on a disc . recall that moduli space of 4 marked points on @xmath74 up to automorphisms of @xmath24 is diffeomorphic to @xmath94 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "but as we evaluate on a constant disc , the image is always a point , while the moduli parameter is lost under the evaluation map .",
    "hence , such a term @xmath93 is of codimension 1 by the virtual dimension , but its actual image is of codimension 2 .",
    "hence terms involving @xmath90 do not appear in the @xmath0 formula , which is obtained by considering the codimension 1 boundary of the image of the chain ( [ big ] ) under evaluation map .",
    "this phenomenon always happens for @xmath51 for any @xmath57 becuase of the same reason .",
    "hence we may set ( transversally ) @xmath95 note that in @xcite , the evaluation maps of constant homotopy class are also perturbed by moduli parameters , so that the image has the same dimension as virtual dimension unlike our setting .",
    "also note that @xmath96 does not vanish as there are no moduli parameters in these cases .",
    "this proves the proposition .",
    "now , because of the presence of @xmath97 terms , @xmath98 does not always hold . hence",
    ", floer homology groups are not well - defined in general .",
    "obstructions for the well - definedness of floer cohomology was studied in @xcite . in an unobstructed case",
    ", one can deform the chain complex suitable way so that @xmath98 holds . for the case of torus fibers in toric fano manifold ,",
    "it is ( weakly ) obstructed , in which case floer cohomology with itself is well - defined .    related phenomenan in the language of @xmath0-algebra is that @xmath97 terms disappear from the @xmath0-formula .    [ unit ]",
    "let @xmath99 be an element in @xmath34 for @xmath100 , for a lagrangian torus fiber @xmath6 in toric fano manifolds .",

    "this was proved in @xcite , except that we do not need to use homotopy unit argument .",
    "recall that the _ forget _ maps commutes with the evaluation maps obviously in our case , whereas they do not commute in @xcite because of the perturbation of evaluation maps at marked points .",
    "we give the proof of the proposition here for the convenience of readers .",
    "note that proposition holds by the definition of @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "hence it is enough to show that @xmath105,\\cdots , x_k)=0 $ ] for @xmath106 with non - zero @xmath107 , and the statement about @xmath108 .",
    "note that the condition for the image of a marked point to meet the fundermental chain @xmath109 $ ] is redundant since it always meets @xmath6 .",

    "the case of @xmath108 follows from sign convention of @xcite .",
    "the second formula implies that the floer cohomology is well - defined in this case as observed in @xcite and @xcite proposition 3.18 ; in this case it was shown that @xmath113 \\otimes t^{e_i } q$ ] is a multiple of fundermental chain .    here",
    ", we write the first three @xmath0-formulas where @xmath97 terms are dropped because of the above proposition .",
    "@xmath114 the first equation implies that @xmath115 defines the cochain complex .",
    "the second equation implies that @xmath116 defines a product of the cohomology up to sign . for @xmath117",
    ", we have @xmath118 .",
    "therefore the third equation implies the associativity of the product up to sign .",
    "@xmath119    to define an associative product ( with correct sign ) on cohomology , one should make the following change of signs .    [ sign ] we define @xmath120    the first sign appears due to cohomological sign convention .",
    "the second sign appears due to the sign convention of @xcite    the resulting @xmath0-formulas for the new @xmath121 are @xmath122 for @xmath117 .",
    "hence @xmath123 defines an graded associative product on @xmath7 .",
    "for example , with the new sign , the classical cup product part of @xmath124 can be written as @xmath125 also associativity in the classical level is just @xmath126",
    "in this section , we discuss the issues regarding the moduli space of @xmath5-holomorphic discs and the transversality of @xmath0-algebra .",
    "we first recall the following theorem .",
    "[ regularity ] holomorphic discs in toric manifolds with boundary on any lagrangian torus fiber are fredholm regular , i.e. , its linearization map is surjective .",
    "hence the moduli space of holomorphic discs ( before compactification ) is a manifold of expected dimensions .",
    "as we try to compactify the moduli space , we may have strata with sphere bubbles .",
    "in general toric fano manifolds , it is already known that holomorphic spheres are not always fredholm regular .",
    "hence in the compactification of holomorphic discs , some strata ( with sphere bubble ) may not have the expected dimension .",
    "but since we only evaluate only at the boundary of the discs ( not on spheres ) , with fano condition , the evaluation image of such strata is always of codimension of two or higher .",
    "hence , it is plausible that these moduli spaces with evaluation maps define currents on @xmath6 . but to make this precise seems to be a non - trivial problem .",
    "similar problem also has been observed in the case of gromov - witten theory if one try to integrate forms over pseudo - cycle(see page 277 of @xcite ) .",
    "the author do not know how to prove it , so we require the following strict assumption on sympletic manifold so that the moduli chain defines a current .",
    "[ assump ] the toric fano manifold @xmath38 is assumed to be convex .",
    "namely we require that for any genus 0 stable map @xmath127 , @xmath128 is generated by global sections .",
    "such assumption holds in the case of complex projective spaces , and products of complex projective spaces . except this rectifiability problem of the compactified moduli chain of holomorphic discs ,",
    "the results in this paper holds for all toric fano manifolds .",
    "even when the assumption is not satisfied , the results in section [ divisor ] can be understood independently as computations of some invariants .",
    "( see proposition [ invariant ] ) .",
    "we remark about perturbing standard complex structure to a tame almost complex structure .",
    "mcduff and salamon @xcite showed that for a subset @xmath129 of second category , so that the moduli spaces of simple @xmath5-holomorphic curves become pseudo - cycles . in the case of j - holomorphic discs , it is more complicated since the structure of non - simple j - holomorphic discs can be very complex .",
    "but due to the structure theorem proven by kwon and oh @xcite , the similar proof as in @xcite can be used to show that the moduli space of simple discs are `` pseudo - chain '' which may be similarly defined as pseudo - cycle .",
    "but also in this case , we do not know if these moduli chains would define currents .",
    "if these define currents , one can prove the invariance of floer cohomology ring in a similar way as in @xcite .",
    "another approach would be to consider kuranishi structure of the moduli space of @xmath5-holomorphic discs ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "but as pointed out in @xcite , it is not ( yet ) possible to find a kuranishi perturbation which is compatible for all homotopy classes in @xmath130 .",
    "such compatibility is rather essential since we are interested in the relations between moduli spaces which produce @xmath0-formula .",
    "now we explain how to achieve transversality of the fiber product in the definition of @xmath0-formulas .",
    "first , recall that ordinary intersection product in the chain level is not well - defined , while cup product is well - defined on cohomology .",
    "hence , even in the classical level , @xmath0-algebra @xmath131 is not easy to define , since operations are defined in the chain level .",
    "but it is obvious how to define it to work only transversally .",
    "similar problem occurs for @xmath78 .",
    "for example the fiber product @xmath132 is not transversal if @xmath133 .",
    "hence , authors of @xcite develop non - trivial technique to overcome such problem .",
    "in this section , we show that if we choose the generic sequence of chains , then the fiber product is transversal , and this transversal @xmath0-algebra is enough to determine homology and its ring structure .",
    "a @xmath31-tuple @xmath134 is called a _ transversal sequence _ if the chain @xmath135 is transversal to the image of the map @xmath136 for all @xmath107 . for a transversal sequence @xmath134 ,",
    "the fiber product @xmath137 is well - defined .",
    "recall that a _ residual _ subset of a space @xmath138 is one which contains the intersection of countably many dense open subsets .    for a residual set of @xmath139 , @xmath31-th @xmath0-formula ( [ aiformula ] ) is well - defined .",
    "namely the all the fiber products given in the formula are transversal .",
    "it is enough to show that transversality of the chain @xmath135 and the image of @xmath140 from each codimension 1 strata of the moduli space of @xmath5-holomorphic discs for all @xmath107 , which can be achieved by choosing generic chains @xmath141 s by the standard transversality theorem .",
    "@xmath142 satisfies @xmath0-formula for dense transversal sequence of chains .",
    "in fact , in our case it is easy to perturb @xmath143 to a transversal sequence due to the presence of torus action .",
    "namely , as torus @xmath144 acts on @xmath6 transitively , hence , for a generic @xmath145 , @xmath146 is a transversal sequence .",
    "also because we have the same torus action on the moduli space of holomorphic discs , we have the following identity .",
    "@xmath147 therefore , the transversality of @xmath0-formula also can be achieved by the torus action on each chains : if @xmath148 term causes non - transversality to define @xmath149 in the @xmath0-formula , then we can perturb all chains inside @xmath148 by the same @xmath150 to make @xmath148 term transversal in @xmath149 by the equality ( [ taction ] ) . also , it is easy to perturb a floer - cycle in its cohomology class by the following lemma .",
    "let @xmath151 be the chain map constructed in definition [ correction ] .",
    "for any cycle @xmath82 of singular homology , @xmath152 is a floer - cycle .",
    "i.e. @xmath153 .",
    "then for @xmath154 , @xmath155 is also a floer cycle , and we have @xmath156 where homotopy @xmath157 is a singular chain with @xmath158 .",
    "the equation ( [ taction ] ) for @xmath159 implies that @xmath160 hence the theorem follows .",
    "the last statement follows by applying the proposition [ iso ] ( 1 ) for the chain @xmath157 with the fact that @xmath161 .",
    "@xmath123 defines a product on the floer cohomology ring @xmath7 .    to show that the product is well - defined on cohomology",
    ", it is enough to show that for @xmath162 with @xmath163 , we have @xmath164 for generic @xmath165 and for some @xmath166 .",
    "first , note that the the fiber product in @xmath167 of @xmath0-algebra is transversal for any chain @xmath82 since the evaluation map from the moduli space is always submersive due to the torus action .",
    "and @xmath168 is transversal if @xmath167 is transversal to @xmath9 .",
    "then , for a generic @xmath150 , @xmath167 is transversal to @xmath169 . also , for generic @xmath165 , @xmath167 is transversal to @xmath157 with @xmath170 .",
    "( if not , we can perturb @xmath171 by another @xmath150 to make them transversal . ) therefore , @xmath172 this finishes the proof .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite , oh and the present author have shown that for any such torus fiber @xmath173 , the floer homology group @xmath174 when nonvanishing , is isomorphic to the singular cohomology of the lagrangian submanifold @xmath175 .",
    "now , we fix a lagrangian torus fiber @xmath6 whose floer cohomology is non - vanishing .",
    "the fact that @xmath7 and @xmath176 is isomorphic as a module is a little bit deceiving because a cycle in the singular homology is _ not _ a cycle in floer homology .",
    "we need to modify a cycle , say @xmath82 , by adding correction terms , say @xmath9 to make it satisfy @xmath177 . in the computations of @xcite or @xcite ,",
    "it was automatically taken care of by the spectral sequence .",
    "we will find exact correction terms for any cycle in proposition [ iso ] .",
    "actually we will construct a filtered chain map from singular chain complex to bott - morse floer complex .",
