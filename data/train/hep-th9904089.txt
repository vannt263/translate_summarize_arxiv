    "the reason why we obtain the four different types of action is related to the fact that the generalized actions in the trace are quaternion valued and thus we should pick up particular combination in order to keep the generalized gauge invariance .",

    "constructive and reguralized quantum theory of gravity will be given by dynamically triangulated simplicial lattice manifold .",
    "in two dimensional quantum gravity we have enough evidences that this is the fact and we have the analytical and numerical formulations to describe it .",
    "as we have seen in the three dimensional example of chern - simons gravity the lattice manifold may be interpreted as spin graph where links carry the quantum numbers of angular momentum .",
    "two dimensional topological gravity has similar nature as the chern - simons gravity where links may carry conformal spin quantum numbers@xcite . in four dimensional lattice gravity formulations",
    "there are similar evidences@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "gauge theory formulation of the lattice gravity and matter will be formulated by the generalized gauge theory . in other words",
    "the generalized gauge theory formulated by differential forms may play a crucial role in formulating a lattice gravity since the diffeomorphism invariance is automatic in the formulation of differential forms .",
    "furthermore differential forms and simplexes have one to one correspondence and thus the fields on the forms can naturally be put on the corresponding simplexes .",
    "quaternion algebra may play a crucial role in the formulation of the lattice gravity formulated by the generalized gauge theory .",
    "in other words even forms , odd forms , fermions and bosons are the fundamental algebraic ingredients which are nicely classified by the quaternion algebra",
    ". furthermore the graded lie algebra will be another fundamental algebra which governs the gauge structure of the generalized gauge theory , in particular , the super symmetry .",
    "thus the semi - direct product of the graded lie algebra and the quaternion algebra is the fundamental structure of the generalized gauge theory and may play an important role in formulating lattice gravity as a gauge theory .",
    "fermionic matter will be generated from the ghosts of quantization by the twist .",
    "the twisting procedure is essentially related with the dirac k@xmath1hler fermion formulation as we have shown in the quantization of topological yang - mills action .",
    "the fermionic ghosts appear as fermionic differential forms and can be put on the simplicial lattice similar as the bosonic fields . we need to understand this twisting mechanism from lattice point of view .    as we have seen in the quantization of the generalized chern - simons actions we needed to introduce infinite number of ghosts due to the infinite reducibility of the system@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to consider possible physical aspects of the introduction of an infinite number of the ghost fields .",
    "an immediate consequence is a democracy of ghosts and classical fields , _",
    "i.e. _ , the classical fields are simply the zero ghost number sector among infinitely many ghost fields and thus the classical gauge fields and ghost fields have no essential difference in the minimal action .",
    "furthermore fermionic and bosonic gauge fields are treated in an equal footing and the series of infinite ghosts originated from the classical fermionic and bosonic fields are complementary . in other words if we only introduce bosonic classical fields in the starting action we need to introduce fermionic fields with odd integer ghost number and bosonic fields with even integer ghost number as we have shown in section 5 .",
    "if we introduce the classical fermionic gauge fields , the odd and even nature should be reversed for the ghost numbers when introducing the corresponding ghost fields to the fermionic gauge fields .",
    "it seems to mean that even the fermionic and bosonic fields have no essential difference in the generalized chern - simons theory . in other words",
    "fermionic fields , bosonic fields , classical fields and ghost fields are mutually inter - related via the quantization procedure .",
    "super symmetry is the natural consequence of topological symmetry with partial gauge fixing of instanton conditions .",
    "thus the introduction of super symmetry is realized via quantization procedure . in the generalized gauge theory graded",
    "lie algebra plays an important role leading to the super symmetry .    the lessons from the lattice chern - simons gravity of the section 4",
    "tell us that the drei bein and spin connection can be simply put on the original and dual lattice , respectively .",
    "this means that the fields of differential forms from the generalized gauge theory will be put on both of the original and dual lattice .",
    "the standard model including weinberg - salam model will be realized by the generalized gauge theory via non - commutative geometry mechanism .",
    "in particular the quaternion algebra plays an essential role here again to formulate the gauge theory of all the differential forms .",
    "it should be noted that connes s non - commutative geometry formulation of weinberg - salam model is a particular example of our generalized gauge theory formulation .",
    "connes has speculated that the discrete two points which he introduced in the non - commutative geometry formulation can be interpreted as the discrete distance of the space time structure which is physically related with the higgs vacuum expectation value@xcite .    in our generalized gauge theory",
    "the quaternion algebra is playing a fundamental role and should have some physical or geometrical interpretation .",
    "i would like to give conjectures on the possible interpretation of the quaternion and the fermion - boson correspondence following to the suggestive examples of analyses given in this summary .",
    "the generalized gauge theory will be formulated on the simplicial lattice manifold and may play a fundamental role in formulating a unified model on the lattice .",
    "quaternion algebra is responsible for differentiating even simplexes , odd simplexes corresponding to even forms and odd forms , and original simplicial lattice and the dual simplicial lattice reflecting boson and fermion nature .",
    "in particular discrete two points in terms of non - commutative geometry would correspond to the original lattice and dual lattice .",
    "matter fermions are generated from ghosts via twisting mechanism which is nothing but the dirac k@xmath1hler fermion formulation .",
    "bosons and fermions are dual to each other in the lattice simlex sense . in other words bosons",
    "are sitting on the original lattice while fermions are sitting on the dual lattice and _ vice versa_. chiral fermion problem will be understood via dirac k@xmath1hler fermion formulation .",
    "this duality relation would be analogous to the ising model where the disorder variable defined on the dual lattice is related to the fermion field as shown in the subsection 2.1 .",
    "strong coupling and weak coupling duality of krammers and wannier type is working here and the fermion will be a soliton on the dual lattice .",
    "the origin of the seiberg and witten formulation@xcite will be related to the duality of original and dual lattice .",
    "due to the complete duality of the original lattice and the dual lattice where fermions and bosons are located on the mutually dual lattices the super symmetry is the natural consequence for the whole system . the super symmetry transformation and the gauge transformation are the change of the fields from one simplex to the other on the original lattice and the dual lattice .",
    "this is analogous to the lattice gauge theory where even sites and odd sites exchange corresponds to the chiral transformation .",
    "there are still many fundamental questions . in this summary",
    "we have mainly discussed topological field theories which do not include dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "then the question arises : + how do the dynamical degrees of freedom appear starting from the theory with higher symmetry such as @xmath0 super symmetry and topological symmetry ?  + we can guess that the classical solution like instanton may play an important role to resolve the higher symmetry into lower symmetry but the mechanism is not yet clear . the topological symmetry or @xmath0 super symmetry may play a similar role as the kinetic term in the lagrangian formulation of field theory .",
    "the field theories keeping higher symmetry such as topological symmetry or higher super symmetry may not yet have genuine non - perturbative interactions which break the symmetry dynamically .",
    "there are other questions concerning to the number of dimensions of our space - time and minkowskian nature .",
    "string approach may be able to understand this question@xcite .",
    "i believe that the string approach and our approach is not incompatible but rather complementary .",

    "<S> non - standard overview on the possible formulation towards a unified model on the lattice is presented . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the generalized gauge theory which is formulated by differential forms and thus expected to fit in a simplicial manifold . </S>",
    "<S> we first review suggestive known results towards this direction . as a small step of concrete realization of the program , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a lattice chern - simons gravity theory which leads to the chern - simons gravity in the continuum limit via ponzano - regge model . </S>",
    "<S> we then summarize the quantization procedure of the generalized gauge theory and apply the formulation to the generalized topological yang - mills action with instanton gauge fixing . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath0 super yang - mills theory with dirac - k@xmath1hler fermions which are generated from ghosts via twisting mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the weinberg - salam model is formulated by the generalized yang - mills action which includes connes s non - commutative geometry formulation as a particular case . in the end a possible scenario to realize the program is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the formulations given here are by far incomplete towards the final goal yet include hopeful evidences . </S>",
