    "in particular , we obtain detonations only in a narrow region in the @xmath249-plane .",
    "on the other hand , the modification of the friction term does not affect significantly the deflagration solutions , as expected .",

    "[ fignofunca ] may arise in some very strongly first - order phase transitions . with the modified friction ,",
    "this behavior remains ( see fig .",
    "[ fignofunca2 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the deflagration solutions are not significantly altered by the modification of the friction .",
    "the runaway solutions appear instead for smaller values of the friction , corresponding to detonations .",
    "nevertheless , the no - solution region has shrunk with this approximation , and it is possible that for a better approximation it will not exist at all .",
    "we wish to stress that this approximation , which consists essentially in assuming a friction force of the form ( [ fricnr ] ) for any wall velocity , may be too simplistic .",
    "although it reproduces the saturation of the friction force at large @xmath250 , the friction force saturates too soon ( at values @xmath251 ) to its ultra - relativistic value ( which is in principle valid for @xmath252 ) .",
    "a different variation of the friction may allow the existence of stationary solutions ( i.e. , detonations ) for a wider range of parameters .",
    "in particular , it is not clear that the friction should be a monotonically growing function of @xmath58 .",
    "indeed , the assumptions that lead to the runaway solution are based on the fact that the fluid is rather unaffected by the passage of the wall , due to the high speed of the latter .",
    "conversely , the fact that the wall is unaffected by the fluid allows it to accelerate .",
    "this is somewhat similar to what happens at the macroscopic level with the stationary hydrodynamical modes , namely , the fastest the detonation , the weaker the disturbance it causes on the fluid @xcite .",
    "moreover , solutions with intermediate velocities ( around the jouguet point ) cause the maximum disturbance .",
    "weaker deflagrations have small velocities and cause little perturbations . weaker detonations",
    "cause less perturbations of the fluid and can thus move much faster .",
    "we may expect a similar behavior at the microscopic level , i.e. , that intermediate velocities will cause larger departures from the equilibrium distributions and , thus , a higher friction .",
    "in particular , it may happen that the real friction force is well approximated by @xmath253 up to relatively high values of @xmath250 , such that @xmath254 but not yet as large as to fulfill the hypothesis of ref .",
    "if this is the case , then the wall will end up moving with a terminal velocity with a moderate value of @xmath32 and never reach the ultra - relativistic regime , in spite of the existence of runaway solutions .",
    "in such a case , the model @xmath255 considered in the previous section would give a better approximation than @xmath256 , although the latter gives the correct ultra - relativistic behavior .",
    "furthermore , it seems that this approximation does not take into account the fact that , if the first - order nature of the phase transition is fluctuation induced , then the bubble wall should not run away , even if the friction coefficient is very small .",
    "in such a case we expect the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figekns ] to give the correct behavior .",
    "we have investigated the steady state motion of phase - transition fronts in a cosmological first - order phase transition . our main goal was to find analytical approximations for the wall velocity , taking into account the different possibilities for the hydrodynamical modes and fluid profiles .",

    "we have considered two different phenomenological models for the friction .",
    "one of them grows linearly with the relativistic velocity @xmath250 @xcite , and the other saturates for large @xmath257 @xcite .",
    "the latter reproduces the behavior of the friction force in the ultra - relativistic limit and leads to runaway solutions @xcite .",
    "our main result is a set of algebraic equations which allow to obtain , from the thermodynamic parameters and the friction coefficient , the value of the wall velocity which will be realized as the final stationary state .",
    "these analytical results rely on several approximations , such as the use of the bag equation of state and the thin wall approximation .",
    "implementing the latter in the equation for the friction requires some ansatz for the variation of the entropy density inside the wall and also for that of the fluid velocity .",
    "the approximation for the entropy density seems to be the roughest one , as we do not obtain the curve of zero entropy production in the limit of vanishing friction . by comparing with numerical lattice calculations @xcite",
    ", we have checked that the strongest departure from the exact solution occurs for the strongest physical solutions , i.e. , those around the jouguet points ( either for detonations or deflagrations ) .    for a friction of the form @xmath250",

    "the region of parameter space in which the bubble wall runs away may be largely overestimated .",

    "<S> finally , we discuss on the saturation of the friction at ultra - relativistic velocities and the existence of runaway solutions . </S>"
