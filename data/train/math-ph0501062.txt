    "in the theory of quantum processes with particles in a constant or slowly varying field , the airy function , related functions and integrals with these functions play an important role [ 1 , 2 ] . in this paper [ which is the lebedev phys .",
    "preprint n 253 ( 1985 ) ] we give the asymptotic expansions for some frequently occurring functions .",
    "we define the airy function and related functions as in [ 3 , 4 ] , but without the factor @xmath18 . starting from @xmath19 and integrating by parts , we have @xmath20 @xmath21 @xmath22    the relation ( 2 ) holds for any @xmath11 , but it is useful only for @xmath23 ( more exactly for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , see p.432 in [ 4 ] , when the remainder term @xmath26 is small compared with the terms of the sum ) .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath27 in ( 2 ) .",
    "so the decrease of terms in the sum ( 2 ) does not provide any guarantee of smallness of the remainder term [ 4 , 5 ] .",
    "its magnitude depends on proximity of saddle points ( in general , critical points ) to the integration path .",
    "assuming @xmath11 fixed and @xmath23 we shall increase @xmath28 in ( 2 ) .",
    "the terms of the sum first decrease in magnitude then increase , as the representation is asymptotic .",
    "it is clear that the sum of increasing terms , generally speaking , grows with @xmath28 and this must be compensated by the remainder term ; the representation with such a term is still exact . when @xmath29 and the remainder term is dropped , we get the asymptotic series and the problem of interpretation of diverging part of the series arises [ 5 ] .",
    "dingle [ 5 ] suggested that the remainder term can be restored just from the general term in each considered series .",
    "indeed , the remainder term can be restored using , when necessary , the additional information about the function .",
    "for this reason it is convenient to regard the divergent sum of late terms as a symbolic representation of the remainder term [ 5 ] . with this understanding the asymptotic series uniquely represents its function and is the complete asymptotic expansion ( for a certain phase range of @xmath11 ) . in general , the complete asymptotic expansion consist of several series ( two for solutions to second - order homogeneous differential equations ) each of which determines its own function [ 5 ] .",
    "in this case the complete asymptotic expansion expresses the linear dependence of the initial function upon other functions each of which is represented by its own series in the considered sector of @xmath11 .",
    "this linear dependence between the functions holds in all sectors of the complex variable @xmath11 , but outside the considered sector the representation of each function by one series may be unsatisfactory , that is the remainder term may be not small .",
    "asymptotic expansions with remainder terms exactly determine their functions .",
    "however , even in the case when the remainder terms are represented only symbolically by the increasing terms of infinite series , it is still possible to require , that complete asymptotic expansions satisfy the same relations as the functions themselves [ 5 ] .",
    "returning now to eq.(2 ) , for @xmath29 we have [ 4 ] @xmath30    another and more simple way of obtaining ( 4 ) consists of expanding @xmath31 in power series and subsequent term by term integration .",
    "the integrable series is convergent everywhere , but nonuniformly , so the integrated series is asymptotic .",
    "we consider now the real @xmath32 .",
    "the integrand in ( 1 ) first exponentially increases ( up to the saddle point @xmath33 ) then decreases . in accordance with this the asymptotic expansion consists of a series of exponentially large terms ( contribution from the saddle point ) and , as we shall see below , of the series ( 4 ) ( contribution from the lower limit of integration ) .    as mentioned above",
    ", complete asymptotic expansion should satisfy the same relations as the functions themselves .",
    "the relation @xmath34 where @xmath35 is important for us here .",
    "it is easily verified by differentiation and using the equations @xmath36    we shall obtain the asymptotic expansions for @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath0 and check them up using ( 5 ) and the known asymptotic expansions for @xmath7 and @xmath8 [ 3 , 4 ] .    the complete asymptotic expansion for @xmath37 , @xmath39 , can be obtained in the following manner . substituting @xmath40 , we have for the exponent in ( 1 ) @xmath41 next we expand @xmath42 in power series and integrate term by term over @xmath43 from @xmath44 to @xmath45 . if we simply extend the region of integration to the whole real axis ( using the condition @xmath46 ) , we get only the exponentially large terms and the relation ( 5 ) will not be satisfied .",
    "so we write @xmath47 in the first integral we use ( 8) and perform the indicated operations . in the second integral",
    "we expand @xmath42 in power series and integrate term by term . letting @xmath48 , we get @xmath49 @xmath50    the relation ( 10 ) agrees with the relation @xmath51 for the functions @xmath52 @xmath53 for which the asymptotic expansions are known [ 4 ] @xmath54 @xmath55 ( assuming @xmath56 $ ] , @xmath57 , it is easy to show that the asymptotic expansion for @xmath58 , @xmath59 , consists of only one series ( 14 ) , cf .",

    "it is worth - while to get the asymptotic expansion for @xmath0 with the remainder term .",

    "the rest are determined from ( 43 ) : @xmath128",
    "in this section using as an example the function @xmath129 , defined by the contour integral ( 45 ) , we consider the stokes phenomenon , that is an abrupt appearance or disappearance of component series of a complete asymptotic expansion at certain phases of @xmath11 .",
    "the complete asymptotic expansion consists of several series ; the number of these component series is different in different sectors of the complex variable @xmath11 .",
    "each series corresponds to a contribution from a single saddle point and determines its own function .",
    "so in different sectors of the complex plane @xmath11 the asymptotic expansion is determined by different number of saddle points .",
    "the problem of choosing of the saddle points , determining an asymptotic expansion , is connected with the topology of steepest decent lines and the disposition of ends of the integration path in the integral representation for the function . for this reasons",
    "we draw the integration path along the steepest descent lines and will watch over its deformation with the change of @xmath11 in the complex plane . for definiteness",
    "we consider the solution of the airy equation @xmath130 given by the integral @xmath131 where the contour @xmath132 goes from infinity in the sector @xmath133 to infinity in the sector @xmath134 ( sectors 1 and 3 in fig.1 - 6 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath129 can be represented by the sum of two integrals over imaginary and real positive half - axes : @xmath135 by substitution @xmath136 the integral @xmath137 is reduced to @xmath13 .",

    "it follows @xmath149",
    "i.e. @xmath150 of these directions those ones , for which the real part of ( 48 ) goes to @xmath151 for @xmath148 ( i.e. @xmath152 ) , just correspond to descent and not to ascent .",
    "but @xmath153=\\pm(-1)^k\\ ] ] is negative at odd @xmath154 for the upper sign and at even @xmath154 for the lower sign .",
    "hence @xmath155    in fig.1 - 6 in the complex @xmath65-plane the locations of saddle points @xmath145 and the behavior of steepest descent lines from the passes are qualitatively indicated for the specific values of phase of the parameter @xmath11 , which changes in its own complex plane , see fig.7 .",
    "the arrows mark off the integration path in ( 45 ) going from the sector @xmath156 into the sector @xmath134 along the steepest descent lines .",
    "when the parameter @xmath11 happens to be on a stokes ray , the steepest descent lines , passing over two saddle points , meet one another at the lower saddle point .",
    "the integration path going over this saddle point either retains its direction or abruptly changes it by @xmath157 .    in the latter case",
    "the integration path passes over both saddle points ; the lower one ( situated at the break ) appears at the integration path when the parameter @xmath11 crosses the stokes ray .",
    "this is a manifestation of the stokesphenomenon : when @xmath11 crosses the stokes ray the integration path begins or stops to pass over the second ( the lower ) saddle point .    at the absence of break on the integration contour it contains only one ( lower ) saddle point . in this case both before and after @xmath11 crosses the stokes ray , the integration contour goes over only one ( the lower ) saddle point and stokes phenomenon does not occur .    in other words , the steepest descent lines , going over different saddle points ,",
    "generally do not meet , but in one of the sectors their ends asymptotically approach each other .",
    "when the parameter @xmath11 approaches the stokes ray , these ends come closer and closer at a greater length . for @xmath11 at the stokes ray , they merge up to the lower saddle point ; in this case the steepest descent line from the higher pass ( active line ) approaches the steepest descent line from the lower pass ( passive line ) at the angle of @xmath157 .",
    "when @xmath11 goes beyond the stokes ray , the active line breaks away from the half of the passive line and goes to infinity along the other half of the line .",
    "so , when @xmath11 crosses the stokes ray , the passive line changes limply , but the active one drastically reverses the direction of its approach to the end of the passive line in order to approach the other end of that line .",
    "if the integration path for @xmath11 near the stokes ray contains the active line , then at @xmath11 crossing the stokes ray the passive line is included in ( see fig.6 , 1 , 2 ) or excluded from ( see fig.2 , 3 , 4 ) the integration path , bringing in it or out of it the lower saddle point .",
    "this is the stokes phenomenon .",
    "if the integration path for @xmath11 near the stokes ray contains only the passive line of descent ( see fig.4 , 5 , 6 ) , then at @xmath11 crossing the stokes ray , the active line ( with its higher pass ) is not contained in the integration path , which , as before , goes only over the lower pass .",
    "so for @xmath11 outside the stokes ray , the integration path contains one or two lines of steepest descent with the ends going to infinity .",
    "asymptotic expansion for the integral over each such line is obtained in usual manner by the saddle point method .",
    "for this reason , in order to get the asymptotic expansion for the considered integral , it is convenient to start from one of the expressions @xmath158 @xmath159 where @xmath160 are defined by the same representation ( 45 ) as @xmath129 but with integration path @xmath161 beginning in the @xmath162 and ending in the @xmath163sector at infinity .",
    "these expressions hold for any @xmath11 , but only one of them becomes suitable for the asymptotic expansion of the initial function in that sector of the complex @xmath164plane for which each of the contours @xmath161 can be drawn along the steepest descent line over the single saddle point .",
    "as seen from fig.1 - 6 for the sector @xmath165 the contours @xmath166 , @xmath167 can be drawn along the steepest descent lines over the passes @xmath168 , @xmath169 .",
    "so in this sector the formula ( 55 ) is suitable . for the sector @xmath170 or @xmath171",
    "this expression is unsuitable as nether @xmath172 , nor @xmath167 can be drawn along the steepest descent line over a single saddle point . however , for @xmath11 in this sector the contour @xmath172 can be drawn along the steepest descent line over the saddle point @xmath173 .",
    "so here the expression ( 54 ) is suitable .",
    "if @xmath11 is on the stokes ray and the integration contour , drawn along the steepest descent lines , does not suffer a break at the lower pass , then such a contour goes over the one , lower saddle point only , see fig.5 , and for the asymptotic representation of integral @xmath129 the formula ( 54 ) is suitable .",
    "if @xmath11 is on the stokes ray and the integration contour , drawn along the steepest descent lines , suffers a break at the lower saddle point ( and therefore passes the higher saddle point , see fig.1 or 3 ) , then it is difficult to obtain the asymptotic expansion for the integral over this path .",
    "yet this integral can be regarded as a limit of the half - sum of integrals with parameters @xmath174 , @xmath175 lying on different sides of the stokes ray and tending to @xmath11 .",
    "hence , for the asymptotic expansion we can use the formula @xmath176 .",
