    "the register content ( referred to as configuration mask or `` register in '' ) encodes all the information needed to configure the chip : 128 bit specifying the enabled channels in test mode ( for an electrical stimulus to be injected as described in section [ sec : linearity_noise_ecal ] ) , 384 bit configuring the threshold fine regulation ( 3 bit per channel ) , 128 bit specifying the disabled channels , 4 bit containing the address offset ( to address up to sixteen xaa1.2 connected in daisy chain ) , 1 bit enabling the stretcher and 1 bit enabling the chip in test mode . by sending twice the configuration mask the actual value contained in the memory ( referred to as `` register out '' )",

    "this measurement provides an estimate of the local environmental background , that depends on the site and will not be present in orbit . in orbit",
    "we expect two major components for the background counting rate : the diffuse x - ray background ( dxb , see @xcite for further information ) impinging on the detector through the open slits of the mask and within the collimator aperture and the tail of the electronic noise , since the particle background is very efficiently eliminated by the upper threshold of the saie .",
    "our current operational definition of threshold is such that the background counting rate is due to the dxb plus a 10 % due to electronic noise .",
    "the threshold voltage estimated with the method outlined above is then converted into a charge threshold ( and then into the corresponding energy threshold ) by means of the threshold scan procedure .",
    "the threshold scan consists in feeding each input channel of the xaa1.2 with a fixed number of pulses at increasing reference voltage . with a proper setting of parameters , the counts detected for",
    "each value of the reference voltage will vary from the total number of pulses ( at low threshold ) to zero ( at high threshold ) . using a linear interpolation ,",
    "the reference voltage is found such that the number of detected triggers equals one half of the number of input pulses . by repeating this procedure at different input charge values ,",
    "the reference voltage value as a function of the input charge can be found , that is the characteristic curve of the discriminator of each channel of the xaa1.2 .",
    "this relation can be used to convert reference voltage values to charge values and to energy , considering the 3.62 average energy to produce an electron - hole pair in silicon .",
    "thus the voltage threshold , based on the background counting rate , can be converted into an energy threshold using the threshold - energy relation .",
    "the superagile threshold defined with this method is arbitrary and is mainly useful to compare conditions where the environmental background is different .    as an example , the histogram of the energy threshold of the same subset of input channels as in sec .",
    "[ sec : linearity_noise_ecal ] and [ sec : linearity_noise_x - rays ] and measured using the method described above is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ethr_hist ] . as it appears from fig .",
    "[ fig : ethr_hist ] , the intrinsic threshold of the xaa1.2 channels is largely non uniform , with a typical standard deviation of 3.3 kev .",
    "a fine threshold adjustment is available , based on a 3-bit internal dac , allowing to reduce the threshold spread .",
    "unfortunately , the variation of the fine threshold of one channel affects all the other channels in the same daisy chain , introducing an offset to their threshold . for this reason ,",
    "the fine threshold adjustment is an iterative procedure , starting with the threshold estimation of each channel with the method described above .",
    "the threshold is then reduced if it is higher and increased if it is lower than the mean value by changing the digital regulation in the xaa1.2 configuration mask according to a complex algorithm and the threshold scan is repeated in the new configuration . usually in 23 steps",
    "the threshold spread is minimized .        from preliminary measurements , performed on a sample of 384 channels ( connected to the silicon microstrip detector ) with average threshold value about 20 kev",
    ", the fine threshold adjustment reduces the threshold spread by about a factor of two .",
    "a detailed description of the method and results on the superagile flight unit will be published elsewhere ( @xcite ) .",
    "the transistor channel noise in the xaa1.2 can be reduced by increasing the transconductance through an increase of the _ prebias _ , controlling the source and the drain current of the preamplifier .",
    "such a _ prebias _ variation produces also a reduction in the peaking time , affecting the shot noise , the thermal noise in the bias resistors and the noise due to the metal strips , all depending on the peaking time as reported in sec .",
    "[ sec : noise_th ] . for superagile the _ prebias _ value is constrained by the chip power consumption , strongly affected by this bias .",
    "in order to keep the peaking time at the 2 @xmath0s nominal value also the _ shabias _ , the _ vfp _ and the _ vfs _ have to be adjusted .    as an example , by increasing the _ prebias _ from 50 @xmath0a to 85 @xmath0a and adjusting correspondingly the _ shabias _ , _ vfp _ and _ vfs _ , the electronic noise of the xaa1.2 decreases from about 1070 @xmath2 , corresponding to 9.1 kev fwhm , to about 820 @xmath2 , corresponding to 7.0 kev fwhm with a power consumption increase of about 2030 % .",
    "the optimization of the signal to noise ratio can be performed as an iterative procedure involving the two bias currents _ prebias _ and _ shabias _ and the two voltages _ vfp _ and _ vfs _ , all affecting the signal shape .",
    "since the xaa1.2 chip does not allow to access the analogue output signal from the shaper before the signal is processed by the peak stretcher and s / h , an indirect way to detect the shaper output signal ( in order to control the effect of the bias currents and voltages variation on the signal shape ) is to switch off the stretcher and to acquire signals at different _ trigdelbias _ values , i.e. with different values of the delay between the trigger and the sampling time of the internal s / h , so reconstructing an oscilloscope - like signal shape image , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oscilloscope ] .            at the beginning of the optimization procedure",
    "the _ prebias _ is increased .",
    "a suitable value for superagile is about 80100 @xmath0a , compatible with its power budget .",
    "the value of the _ vfp _ is then adjusted to about 100 mv above the value that produces the preamplifier saturation and the exact bias value is selected searching the minimum of the noise as a function of _ vfp _ by using the test pulse generator , see for example fig .",
    "[ fig : vfp_scan ] .",
    "the _ shabias _ and _ vfs _ are then adjusted to keep the peaking time as close as possible to the 2 @xmath0s nominal value and to reduce the noise . in this way the minimum of the noise can be found and the optimal values of the parameters can be selected .",
    "the superagile instrument in orbit will work between @xmath83 and @xmath84 ( operative temperature range ) .",
    "to characterise the temperature dependence of the xaa1.2 performances , we measured the variation with temperature of the gain ( used to reconstruct the amplitude of the detected photons ) and the address signals ( needed to reconstruct the photons position ) .",

    "the temperature of the xaa1.2 ( measured with an infrared thermometer ) is about @xmath87 higher than the environment temperature , because of its power dissipation .",
