    "the resolution of the spacetime singularity has been a long standing problem  @xcite .",
    "it is believed that quantum gravity will resolve the singularity , and string theory seems the most promising candidate for quantum gravity .",
    "so far , one of the most important outcomes from string theory is the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite , or more generally the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "there are two ways to use the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the first one is to use the correspondence to understand the strongly coupled field theory using classical gravity .",
    "remarkably , the correspondence has been used in the condensed matter context for calculating correlation functions in a strongly interacting field theory using the dual classical gravity description .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence can also be used the other way around .",
    "namely , the ads / cft correspondence can be used to describe quantum gravity using a well - defined dual field theory .",
    "since cft is a healthy , unitary theory , it is natural to expect that the ads / cft correspondence resolves the singularity problem .",
    "indeed , this view has been applied to the singularity problem in the past  @xcite .    even in the classical context",
    ", the singularity is annoying .",
    "recently , it is found that black hole singularities can be treated by an excision method in numerical relativity  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see if this idea can be promoted to a theoretical framework .",
    "in fact , the singularity excision has been discussed in the context of black hole evaporation  @xcite . in principle , the excision method can be formulated as an effective field theory with boundary , which can be improved with a renormalization group idea .",
    "interestingly , the above apparently two different approaches merged into a recent proposal by maldacena that an ads bubble in a ds spacetime can be replaced by a boundary cft according to the ads / cft duality  @xcite .",
    "since ads spacetime is unstable to the formation of a singularity under a small perturbation , if this proposal is valid , we can avoid dealing directly with a singular spacetime by replacing it with the spacetime with boundary . in a sense , we have a stringy realization of the singularity excision .    apparently , it is worth exploring this proposal in detail . a simple , direct route to the understanding of the proposal is to study incident gravitons from the outside ds universe into the ads bubble . in the original picture",
    ", gravitons can penetrate into the ads bubble .",
    "one can calculate the transmission probability for this process .",
    "how should we understand this process in the dual picture in which the ads bubble is replaced by the boundary bubble wall with the dual cft ?",
    "since there is nothing inside of the bubble wall , it is expected intuitively that the energy of gravitons would be transferred to particles of the cft .",
    "in fact in the limit of infinitely large ds radius ( i.e. , in the minkowski limit ) , by calculating the transmission probability of gravitons coming from the ds side through the bubble wall , it is argued that the result can be interpreted as the absorption probability of gravitons into cft particles  @xcite .",
    "however , the method used in  @xcite was specific to four dimensions and the detailed discussion was provided only for the case of an ads bubble in minkowski spacetime .",
    "here we are interested in more general situations .",
    "if maldacena s conjecture is correct , it should hold in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "we study the singularity excision in general @xmath0 spacetime dimensions .",
    "in particular , we give much attention to the role of the ds universe in this dual picture .",
    "we note that , in the string landscape or in the multiverse picture  @xcite , ads bubbles will be formed in various kinds of ds vacua in ( perhaps ) various spacetime dimensions .",
    "our analysis will be relevant to these cosmologically interesting situations .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] , we provide a model for ads bubbles nucleating in the inflating multiverse and explain the dual picture where the ads bubble is replaced with the boundary cft . in section  [ sec : transprob ] , we calculate the transmission probability in arbitrary dimensions . in section  [ sec : dual ] , we identified the transmission probability with the absorption probability in the dual picture . in the decoupling limit of gravity in the sense of ads",
    "/ cft correspondence , it turns out that the absorption probability is factorized into a factor from effective degrees of cft matter , an effective gravitational coupling constant , and a kinematical factor .",
    "we obtain an explicit formula for various situations .",
    "we find the absorption probability is controlled by graviton bound states originating in de sitter spacetime .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion . in appendix",
    "[ app : legendre ] , we summarize several useful mathematical formulas . in appendix",
    "[ app:4dexact ] , we give an exact formula for the transmission probability in four dimensions without taking the decoupling limit , in order to make precise comparison with the result obtained in  @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ app : bs ] , a computation of the bound states in the presence of an ads bubble is given . in appendix",

    ", we pick up a part of the multiverse where the universe is in a ds vacuum .",
    "first , we describe an ads bubble in the ds universe .",
    "then , we present a dual of this geometry by following maldacena  @xcite .    , the ads bubble does not hide the great circle of ds . while , in the case @xmath3 , there is no great circle in ds spacetime .",

    "we have defined @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the tension corresponding to a flat domain wall @xmath23 .",
    "we note that the choice @xmath24 is more natural in the sense that it corresponds to the coleman - de luccia bubble  @xcite , that is , an ads bubble nucleated in the ds universe . on the other hand",
    ", the choice @xmath3 corresponds to the case when both ads and ds spacetimes are surrounded by a common boundary wall . although the latter may not be easily realizable if considered in the context of field theory , mathematically there is nothing wrong with such a configuration .",
    "moreover , if we consider multiple nucleation processes , a ds bubble could be produced as a remnant of the false vacuum  @xcite .",
    "therefore we consider both of these two cases in the following .    by following maldacena s conjecture  @xcite , we excise the ads bubble and replace it with a boundary cft .",
    "the resultant spacetime is ds bounded by a boundary ds on which cft lives .",

    "( [ boundstate ] ) irrespective of the value of @xmath295 .",
    "however , in complete analogy with the @xmath79 case discussed above , since the @xmath240 dependence of @xmath296 disappears and we have @xmath287",

    "( [ bound : smooth1 ] ) gives a trivial solution @xmath288 .",
    "therefore there is no bound state solution in the minkowski disc limit except for the zero mode , @xmath297      if the domain wall moves away from @xmath284 , massive bound state solutions may appear for @xmath289 .",
    "since an analytical study is difficult for general values of @xmath71 , we consider the case of a maximal radius bubble @xmath123 .    in this case",
    ", we can solve eq .",
    "( [ boundstate ] ) analytically if we recall the formula ( [ hgformula ] ) . setting @xmath298 and @xmath299",

    "however , if we remember that the case @xmath318 with integer @xmath240 is simply a legendre polynomial @xmath319 , we immediately see that @xmath318 is not a bound state solution because @xmath320 .    hence the number of the bound states is @xmath321 $ ] instead of @xmath322 $ ] .",
    "namely , for the @xmath307-th bound state to exist we need @xmath323 or @xmath324 .",

    "this tachyonic mode is known to be the wall fluctuation mode ( at least in the limit of minkowski bulk ) .    if we calculate @xmath341 using eq .",
