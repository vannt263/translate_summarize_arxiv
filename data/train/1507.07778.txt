    "a fundamental topic in topology is the study of maps of non - zero degree between manifolds of the same dimension .",
    "the existence of a map of non - zero degree defines a transitive relation , called domination relation , on the homotopy types of closed oriented manifolds .",
    "whenever such a map @xmath0 exists we say that @xmath1 _ dominates _ @xmath2 and denote this by @xmath3 .",
    "gromov suggested investigating the domination relation as defining a partial order of manifolds and formulated several conjectures for candidate classes that might ( not ) be comparable under @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "a particular case of the domination question is when the domain is a non - trivial direct product .",
    "that case was raised in gromov s theory of functorial semi - norms ( such as the simplicial volume , see also  @xcite ) and of topological rigidity , where gromov predicted that the fundamental classes of certain aspherical manifolds with large universal covers are not dominated by products .",
    "furthermore , the domination - by - products question has its own independent interest , being a special case of steenrod s classical problem on the realization of homology classes by manifolds  @xcite .",
    "the homotopy types of aspherical manifolds are determined by their fundamental groups .",
    "long - standing rigidity conjectures state that their homeomorphism types are determined by their fundamental groups as well .",
    "several related questions concern the decomposition of the fundamental group of an aspherical manifold as a direct product and the realization of finitely presented poincar duality groups as fundamental groups of aspherical manifolds .",
    "an open question in this context is whether every closed aspherical manifold @xmath1 with fundamental group @xmath5 can be decomposed ( up to homotopy , homeomorphism , etc ) as a product of closed manifolds with fundamental groups @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively . in particular",
    ", it is an open question whether aspherical manifolds with _",
    "reducible _ fundamental groups ( that is , fundamental groups that are virtual products of two infinite groups ) are finitely covered  and therefore dominated  by products .",
    "lck showed how to obtain an affirmative answer in dimensions higher than four , relying on very strong assumptions concerning the farrell - jones conjecture and the cohomological dimensions of the involved groups  @xcite . for manifolds with a metric of non - positive curvature an affirmative answer",
    "is given by gromoll - wolf s isometric splitting theorem  @xcite .",
    "applying thom s emphatic answer ( in rational homology )  @xcite of steenrod s realization problem , we will show that every closed aspherical manifold with reducible fundamental group is indeed dominated by products .",
    "therefore , in this paper we are interested to investigate whether aspherical closed manifolds with irreducible fundamental group admit arbitrary maps of non - zero degree by non - trivial direct products ( clearly such maps can not be homotopic to coverings ) .",
    "our goal is to introduce a new algebraic obstruction to domination by products for aspherical manifolds whose fundamental groups have non - trivial center .",
    "we will obtain new classes of aspherical manifolds that do not admit maps of non - zero degree from direct products , extending a previous obstruction of kotschick and lh  @xcite , and expanding gromov s predictions ( about irreducible , non - positively curved manifolds ) to aspherical manifolds with non - trivial center .",
    "in many cases , we will prove that the existence of a map of non - zero degree from a direct product is equivalent to the existence of a finite covering of the same product type .",
    "this characterization contains a special case of a criterion for reducibility for arbitrary ( i.e. not necessarily finitely generated or torsion - free ) groups whose quotient by their center fulfills a certain property .",
    "moreover , our results combined with hillman s work  @xcite characterize aspherical 4-manifolds possessing a product geometry .",

    "kotschick and lh  @xcite verified gromov s conjecture , by finding an algebraic obstruction to domination by products for rationally essential manifolds .",
    "a closed oriented connected @xmath9-dimensional manifold @xmath1 is called _ rationally essential _ if the classifying map of the universal covering @xmath10 sends the fundamental class of @xmath1 to a non - trivial element in @xmath11 ; see  @xcite .",
    "the non - domination criterion of  @xcite , given in theorem [ t : kotschickloehmain ] below , reads as follows : an infinite group @xmath12 is called _ not presentable by products _ if , for every homomorphism @xmath13 onto a finite index subgroup of @xmath12 one of the factors @xmath14 has finite image @xmath15 .",
    "as we shall see in section [ s : notation ] , the proof of theorem [ t : kotschickloehmain ] was obtained by showing that the existence of a map of non - zero degree @xmath16 , with @xmath1 rationally essential , implies a presentation by products @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "however , the proof of that statement does not give any insight on the index of the presenting factors @xmath6 , @xmath7 in @xmath19 . in fact , all the possibilities for the indices @xmath20 $ ] may occur , as we will see in example [ ex : allcasesindex ] .",
    "the targets of that example are however direct products of ( aspherical ) manifolds .",
    "hence , a main question is to understand how close to  reducible \" must the fundamental group of an aspherical manifold be , in order this manifold to be dominated by products .",
    "indeed , the case of reducible fundamental groups has a complete affirmative answer :    [ thma ] a closed aspherical manifold with reducible fundamental group is dominated by a non - trivial direct product of closed oriented manifolds .",
    "thus our purpose in this article is to examine aspherical manifolds with irreducible fundamental groups .",
    "we extend the notion  group not presentable by products \" , including groups with ( virtually ) infinite center :    [ def : notiipp ] an infinite group @xmath12 is called _ not infinite - index presentable by products _ or _ not iipp _ if , for every homomorphism @xmath21 onto a finite index subgroup of @xmath12 at least one of the images @xmath22 has finite index in @xmath12 .",
    "the strong feature of the property  not iipp \" is that it detects at once all the possible dimensions of the factors of a product that dominates ( with a @xmath23-surjective map ) a rationally essential manifold with torsion - free fundamental group . for aspherical manifolds one of the factors",
    "can be taken as simple as possible :    our first main non - domination result deals with circle bundles :    [ thmb ] let @xmath1 be a circle bundle over a closed oriented aspherical manifold @xmath24 , so that @xmath19 is not iipp and its center remains infinite cyclic in finite covers",
    ". then @xmath1 is not dominated by any non - trivial direct product of closed oriented manifolds .",
    "the fundamental groups of the aspherical manifolds of the above theorem are presentable by products having infinite ( cyclic ) center . by eberlein",
    "s works  @xcite or , more generally , by the stirring work of farb and weinberger  @xcite , irreducible manifolds of dimension higher than one with fundamental groups with center do not admit metrics of non - positive sectional curvature .",
    "the non - domination results of kotschick and lh  @xcite deal mostly with non - positively curved manifolds .",
    "more precisely , they show that non - positively curved manifolds are dominated by products if and only if they are virtually diffeomorphic to products .",
    "equivalently , the fundamental groups of those manifolds are reducible if and only if they are presentable by products . in the case of fiber bundles ( which includes",
    "as well manifolds that do not admit any metric of non - positive sectional curvature  @xcite ) , the results of  @xcite deal either with targets whose fiber and base have fundamental groups not presentable by products or with targets with non - vanishing simplicial volume .    a circle bundle @xmath1 over an aspherical manifold has vanishing simplicial volume  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the infinite cyclic fundamental group of the @xmath25-fiber is obviously presentable by products and , as mentioned above , central in @xmath19 .",
    "however , the property  presentable by products \" is not generally equivalent to  reducible \" for the fundamental groups of circle bundles ; e.g. the fundamental group of any circle bundle over a closed surface with non - zero rational euler class is presentable by products and irreducible .",
    "nevertheless , when the base of the circle bundle has fundamental group not presentable by products , then @xmath19 is reducible if and only if it is iipp .",
    "the following result characterizes circle bundles with the latter property :    [ thmc ] let @xmath26 be a circle bundle over a closed aspherical manifold @xmath24 whose fundamental group @xmath27 is not presentable by products .",
    "then the following are equivalent :    * @xmath1 is dominated by a non - trivial product of closed oriented manifolds ; * @xmath1 is finitely covered by a product @xmath28 , for some finite cover @xmath29 ; * @xmath19 is reducible ; * @xmath19 is iipp .",
    "the idea of theorem [ thmc ] is that the center of @xmath19 is forced to remain infinite cyclic in finite covers , because the center of @xmath27 remains trivial , being not presentable by products and torsion - free .",
    "in fact , the equivalence between @xmath30 and @xmath31 holds in its greatest generality with no assumptions on finite generation , torsion freeness or the virtual rank of the center :    [ thmd ] let @xmath12 be a group with center @xmath32 such that the quotient @xmath33 is not presentable by products .",
    "then , @xmath12 is reducible if and only if it is iipp .    in the light of theorem [ thma ]",
    "we obtain the following consequence of theorem [ thmd ] :    let @xmath1 be a closed oriented aspherical manifold such that @xmath19 is iipp and @xmath34 is not presentable by products .",
    "then there exists a closed oriented manifold @xmath2 such that @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the @xmath37-dimensional torus with @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , @xmath1 has zero simplicial volume .",
    "it is a long - standing conjecture that the simplicial volume of a closed aspherical manifold whose fundamental group contains a non - trivial amenable normal subgroup vanishes . the vanishing result in the above corollary is a straightforward consequence of the domination @xmath35 ( applying theorems [ thmd ] and [ thma ] ) . alternatively , after showing that @xmath19 is a virtual product with an abelian factor ( by theorem [ thmd ] ) , the vanishing of the simplicial volume of @xmath1 follows as well by the fact that every closed aspherical manifold whose fundamental group is virtually a product with an amenable factor has zero simplicial volume  @xcite .",
    "the property iipp truly recognizes reducibility of a group @xmath12 whenever the quotient @xmath33 is not presentable by products . indeed ,",
    "iipp is not anymore a criterion for a group @xmath12 to be reducible when the quotient @xmath33 is presentable by products :    [ ex : heisenberg ] the @xmath39-dimensional heisenberg group @xmath40 is _ irreducible and iipp_. the quotient @xmath41 is free abelian of rank @xmath8 .",
    "note that @xmath40 is realizable by a non - trivial circle bundle over @xmath42 . in section [ s : heisenberg ] we will prove that this manifold is not dominated by products .",

    "this is not true in lower dimensions as we shall see in theorem [ thme ] below .",
    "we now characterize the fundamental groups of certain aspherical manifolds , giving non - trivial examples of groups presentable by products , but not iipp .",
    "then , we apply our main results to show that an aspherical @xmath8-manifold possessing a thurston geometry is dominated by a direct product if and only if it is virtually a direct product .",
    "finally , we order all the non - hyperbolic aspherical thurston geometries in dimension four .      the condition  not iipp \" is the crucial property for the non - existence results of this paper .",
    "the following result gathers together some non - elementary examples of groups not iipp .",
    "[ thme ] irreducible fundamental groups of aspherical manifolds that possess a thurston solvable geometry in dimensions @xmath45 are not iipp .",
    "the above statement contains solvable groups that are not presentable by products as well .",
    "these are either @xmath46-manifold groups or solvable groups of cohomological dimension four whose second betti number is trivial in every finite index subgroup and are realized by 4-manifolds on the geometries @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "theorem [ thme ] says , roughly , that in low dimensions the properties  reducible \" and  iipp \" are actually equivalent .",
    "the requirement on the cohomological dimension being at most four is crucial in the above theorem , because as we have seen in example [ ex : heisenberg ] the @xmath39-dimensional heisenberg group @xmath40 is irreducible and iipp .",
    "after  @xcite , it is natural to ask to what extent the condition",
    " presentable by products \" on the fundamental group of a rationally essential manifold @xmath1 would be sufficient for the existence of a map of non - zero degree @xmath49 .",
    "theorem [ thma ] says that reducibility suffices for aspherical manifolds .",
    "a complete answer is known in dimension three  @xcite , where kotschick and the author proved that a closed @xmath50-manifold is dominated by products if and only if it is either a virtual product or a virtual connected sum of copies of @xmath51 .",
    "thus , in particular , non - trivial circle bundles over closed oriented aspherical surfaces are never dominated by products , although their fundamental groups are presentable by products , having infinite center .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that a closed @xmath50-manifold possesses one of the geometries @xmath52 or @xmath53 if and only if it is virtually a non - trivial circle bundle over a closed aspherical surface ( torus or a hyperbolic surface respectively ) .    the first main application of theorems [ thmb ] and [ thmc ] , together with the examples of groups not iipp given in theorem [ thme ] , is the following characterization in dimension four :    [ thmf ] a closed oriented aspherical geometric @xmath8-manifold @xmath1 is dominated by a non - trivial product if and only if it is finitely covered by a product .",
    "equivalently , @xmath1 carries one of the product geometries @xmath54 or the reducible @xmath55 geometry .",
    "the existence of finite coverings of ( diffeomorphism ) type @xmath56 for manifolds modelled on product geometries @xmath57 is due to hillman  @xcite ( note that domination by products alone follows by theorem [ thma ] as well ) .",
    "the above theorem says that only geometric aspherical @xmath8-manifolds that are virtual products admit maps of non - zero degree from direct products .",
    "we note that we could have included non - aspherical geometries as well in the above statement , however those geometries are not interesting for the domination - by - products question , either because they are products themselves or because their representatives are simply connected .",
    "the latter geometries were contained as trivial examples in  @xcite , where we constructed maps from products to every simply connected @xmath8-manifold .      in a lecture in 1978 , gromov suggested to investigate the domination relation as defining an ordering of compact manifolds of the same dimension  @xcite . in dimension two ,",

    ", steenrod raised the question of whether every @xmath9-dimensional integral homology class can be realized as the image of the fundamental class of a closed oriented @xmath9-dimensional manifold under a continuous map  ( * ? ? ? * problem 25 ) .",
    "about a decade later , thom answered affirmatively steenrod s question in degrees up to six and in any degree in homology with @xmath63 coefficients .",

    "whenever @xmath67 is not zero , we say that @xmath1",
    "_ dominates _",
    "@xmath2 ( or that @xmath1 _ @xmath67-dominates _ @xmath2 ) , and write @xmath74 ( or @xmath75 ) .",
    "the degree of @xmath72 is denoted by @xmath76 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , in this paper we consider continuous maps between the homotopy types of closed oriented connected manifolds .",
    "the domain of a non - zero degree map is usually a more complicated manifold than the target .",

    "@xmath77 is at least as large as @xmath78 _ if some finite index subgroup of @xmath77 surjects onto a finite index subgroup of @xmath78 ) .",
    "these necessary domination conditions can be derived by the following well - known properties :    [ l : fundgroupandqhomology ] let @xmath1 , @xmath2 be two closed oriented @xmath9-dimensional manifolds and suppose @xmath71 is a map of non - zero degree . then the following hold :    * the image @xmath79 of the induced homomorphism @xmath80 is a finite index subgroup of @xmath81 . *",
    "the induced homomorphisms @xmath82 are surjective ; equivalently @xmath83 are injective .",
    "gromov suggested to investigate the domination relation as defining an ordering of manifolds and as a tool to understand the values of functorial semi - norms on homology  @xcite .",
    "one of the most prominent functorial semi - norms , defined by gromov , is the simplicial volume .",
    "the functoriality of the simplicial volume implies that manifolds which admit self - maps of absolute degree higher than one have zero simplicial volume .",
    "for instance , spheres and direct products with a sphere factor have vanishing simplicial volume .",
