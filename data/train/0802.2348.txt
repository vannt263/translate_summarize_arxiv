    "the phenomenon of spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry ( sbrs ) in rotating systems relates to occurrences in which physical systems which rotate fast enough deform in a manner which breaks their rotational symmetry , a symmetry which is present when these systems are static or rotating slowly .",
    "the recognition that rotating physical systems can yield solutions with less symmetry than the governing equations is not new .",
    "one famous example which dates back to @xmath0 is that of the equilibrium configurations of a rotating fluid mass .",
    "it was jacobi who was first to discover that , if rotated fast enough , a self - gravitating fluid mass can have equilibrium configurations lacking rotational symmetry .",
    "in modern terminology , jacobi s asymmetric equilibria appear through a symmetry breaking bifurcation from a family of symmetric equilibria as the angular momentum of the system increases above a critical value ( a `` bifurcation point '' ) @xcite . above this critical value ,",
    "rotationally - symmetric configurations are no longer stable , and configurations with a broken rotational symmetry become energetically favorable .    by now it is widely recognized that symmetry - breaking bifurcations in rotating systems are of frequent occurrence and that this is in fact a very general phenomenon , appearing in a variety of physical settings among which are fluid dynamics , star formation , heavy nuclei , chemical reactions , plasmas , and biological systems , to mention some diverse examples .",
    "recently , sbrs has also been observed in self - gravitating @xmath1-body systems @xcite , where the equilibrium configurations of an @xmath1-body self - gravitating system enclosed in a finite 3 dimensional spherical volume have been investigated using a mean - field approach . it was shown that when the ratio of the angular momentum of the system to its energy is high , spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry occurs , manifesting itself in the formation of double - cluster structures .",
    "these results have also been confirmed with direct numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that a large number of phenomena exhibited by many - body systems have their counterparts and parallels in field theory , which in some sense is a limiting case of @xmath1-body systems in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "since the closest analogies to a lump of matter in field theories are solitons , the presence of sbrs in self - gravitating @xmath1-body systems has led us to expect that it may also be present in solitonic field theories .",
    "our main motivation towards studying sbrs in solitons is that in hadronic physics skyrme - type solitons @xcite often provide a fairly good qualitative description of nucleon properties .",
    "in particular , it is interesting to ask what happens when such solitons rotate quickly , because this might shed some light on the non - spherical deformation of excited nucleons with high orbital angular momentum , a subject which is now of considerable interest .",
    "we address this issue in more detail in the concluding section of this manuscript .",
    "in what follows , we study sbrs in one of the simplest and well - known field theoretic models admitting stable rotating solitonic solutions , namely the baby skyrme model @xcite .",
    "first , we give a brief account for the occurrence of sbrs in physical systems in general , and then use the insights gained from this discussion to infer the conditions under which sbrs might appear in solitonic models and in that context study its appearance in baby skyrme models .",
    "specifically , we shall show that sbrs emerges if the domain manifold of the model is a two - sphere or a disk , while if the domain is @xmath3 , sbrs does not occur .",
    "the onset of sbrs may be qualitatively understood as resulting from a competition between the static energy of a system and its moment of inertia . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a system described by a set of degrees of freedom @xmath4 , and assume that the dynamics of the system is governed by a lagrangian which is invariant under spatial rotations .",
    "when the system is static , its equilibrium configuration is obtained by minimizing its static energy @xmath5 with respect to its degrees of freedom @xmath4 @xmath6 usually , if @xmath7 does not include terms which manifestly break rotational symmetry , the solution to ( [ eq : estat1 ] ) is rotationally symmetric ( with the exception of degenerate spontaneously - broken vacua , which are not of our concern here ) . if the system rotates with a given angular momentum @xmath8 , its configuration is naturally deformed . assuming that the lagrangian of the system is quadratic in the time derivatives , stable rotating configurations ( if such exist ) are obtained by minimizing its total energy @xmath9 @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ratio between the angular momentum of the system and its angular velocity @xmath12 ( which for simplicity we assume is oriented in the direction of the angular momentum ) .",
    "@xmath11 is the ( scalar ) moment of inertia of the system .",
    "the energy functional ( [ eq : erot1 ] ) consists of two terms .",
    "the first , @xmath5 , increases with the asymmetry .",
    "this is simply a manifestation of the minimal - energy configuration in the static case being rotationally symmetric .",
    "the second term @xmath13 , having the moment of inertia in the denominator , decreases with the asymmetry . at low values of angular momentum ,",
    "the @xmath5 term dominates , and thus asymmetry is not energetically favorable , but as the value of angular momentum increases , it is the second term which becomes dominant , thus giving rise to a possible breaking of rotational symmetry .      as an illustration of the above reasoning",
    "let us consider the simple problem of a self - gravitating ellipsoid of liquid mass @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the density of the ellipsoid @xmath15 is assumed to be constant but its shape is allowed to deform .",
    "the boundary of the ellipsoid may be parametrized by [ eq : ellipsurface ] & & r(,)= + & & ( ^2 ^2 + ( 1 + ^2 -2 2 ) ) ^-1/2 , with @xmath16 $ ] being the polar angle , and @xmath17 the azimuthal angle . here",
    ", the ellipsoid has two degrees of freedom @xmath18 , with a third degree of freedom eliminated by the constraint of constant volume , and a non - zero value of @xmath19 indicates breaking of rotational symmetry . the static energy of the ellipsoid is due to self - gravitation and is given by [ eq : ellipstatic ] & & e _ ( , ) = + & & - g m^2 _ 0^ ( ( a_1+u)(a_2+u)(a_3+u ) ) ^-1/2 ud , where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xcite . the minimal - energy configuration of the static self - gravitating ellipsoid is obtained by minimizing ( [ eq : ellipstatic ] ) with respect to the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath19 , giving @xmath24 this means that the configuration that minimizes @xmath5 is a sphere . when the ellipsoid is rotated with angular momentum @xmath8 , the expression for its",

    "it is the ` competition ' between these two expressions in the minimization of ( [ eq : ellipserot ] ) , that determines whether and when sbrs occurs .    a ( numerical ) minimization of the energy functional ( [ eq : ellipserot ] ) for different values of @xmath29 with respect to the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath19 ( the constants of the problem are taken to be @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) indeed reveals the presence of sbrs . below a critical value of angular momentum @xmath33 ( which here is @xmath34 ) , rotationally - symmetric configurations are energetically more favorable , and",
    "@xmath35 minimizes the energy .",
    "the ellipsoid boundary is an oblate spheroid . above @xmath33",

    "in what follows , we show that the above mechanism of sbrs is present in solitonic field theories as well , specifically in certain types of baby skyrme models .",
    "the baby skyrme model is a non - linear theory in @xmath37 dimensions which has several applications in condensed - matter physics @xcite .",
    "the target manifold is a three - dimensional vector @xmath38 with the constraint @xmath39 .",
    "the lagrangian density is given by [ eq : babylag ] & = & 12 _ ^ - -^2(1-_3 ) , equipped with a minkowski metric .",
    "the first term in the lagrangian is the usual kinetic term known from @xmath40 models .",
    "the second term is fourth order in derivatives and is the analogue of the skyrme term in the @xmath41 skyrme model @xcite .",
    "the last term is a potential term , which is introduced to ensure the stability of the solutions @xcite .",
    "henceforth , we shall refer to this model as the ` usual ' or ` original ' baby skyrme model .",
    "the existence of stable solutions in this model is a consequence of the nontrivial topology of the mapping @xmath42 of the physical space into the field space at a given time , @xmath43 where the physical space @xmath3 is compactified to @xmath44 by requiring the spatial infinity to be equivalent in each direction .",
    "the topology which stems from this one - point compactification allows the classification of maps into equivalence classes , each of which has a unique conserved quantity called the topological charge .",
    "the static solutions of the baby skyrme model ( [ eq : babylag ] ) have rotationally - symmetric energy and charge distributions in the charge - one and charge - two sectors @xcite .",
    "the charge - one skyrmion has an energy peak at its center which drops down exponentially .",
    "the energy distribution of the charge - two skyrmion has a ring - like peak around its center at some characteristic distance .",
    "the rotating solutions of the model have also been previously studied @xcite .",
    "it has been found that rotation at low angular velocities slightly deforms the skyrmion but it remains rotationally - symmetric . for larger values of angular velocity ,",
    "the rotationally - symmetric configuration becomes unstable but in this case the skyrmion does not undergo symmetry breaking .",
    "its stability is restored through a different mechanism , namely that of radiation .",
    "the skyrmion radiates out the excessive energy and angular momentum , and as a result begins slowing down until it reaches equilibrium at some constant angular velocity , its core remaining rotationally - symmetric .",
    "moreover , if the skyrme fields are restricted to a rotationally symmetric ( hedgehog ) form , the critical angular velocity above which the skyrmion radiates can be obtained analytically .",
    "it is simply the coefficient of the potential term @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "numerical full - field simulations we have conducted show that the skyrmion actually begins radiating well below @xmath46 , as radiation itself may be non - rotationally - symmetric .",
    "the skyrmion s core , however , remains rotationally symmetric for every angular velocity .",
    "the stabilizing effect of the radiation on the solutions of the model has lead us to believe that models in which radiation is somehow inhibited may turn out to be good candidates for the occurrence of sbrs . in the present paper we study two such baby skyrme models . in these models",
    "energy and angular momentum are not allowed to escape to infinity through radiation , and for high enough angular momentum the mechanism responsible for sbrs discussed in the previous section takes over , revealing solutions with spontaneously broken rotational symmetry .",
    "the first model we discuss is a baby skyrme model in which the physical space @xmath3 is replaced by a unit two - sphere , and in the second model skyrmions are confined to the inside of a unit circle in @xmath3 .",
    "we compute the minimal - energy configurations of the rotating solutions of both models by applying a full - field relaxation method with which exact numerical solutions are obtained . for the baby skyrme model on the two - sphere",
    "we also take a more analytical approach using rational maps .",
    "we discuss these models and the minimization method in more detail in the next section .",
    "the first baby skyrme model we investigate which exhibits sbrs is the one for which both the domain and target manifolds are unit two - spheres .",
    "this model may be thought of as skyrme s original @xmath47d model once the radial coordinate is integrated out @xcite . as in the usual baby skyrme model ,",
    "the lagrangian density is simply [ o3lagrangian ] & = & 12 _ ^ + & - & , with the metric @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the polar angle @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 is the azimuthal angle @xmath52 . in this model",
    "a potential term is not necessary for the stability of the solutions @xcite and thus is omitted .",
    "the lagrangian of this model is invariant under rotations in both the domain and the target spaces , possessing an @xmath53 symmetry .    as in the original baby skyrme model ,",
    "the relevant homotopy group here is @xmath54 , implying that each field configuration is characterized by an integer topological charge @xmath55 , the topological degree of the map @xmath38 , which in spherical coordinates is given by [ eq : o3bdens ] b= 14 , where @xmath56 .",
    "static solutions within each topological sector are obtained by minimizing the energy functional [ eq : estat ] e_&=&14 b ( 12 ( _ ) ^2 + 12 ( _ ) ^2 + & + & ) , where the @xmath57 factor has been inserted for convenience .",
    "the static solutions of the model were studied in detail in @xcite up to charge @xmath58 .",
    "these which are rotationally - symmetric are the charge - one skyrmion has an analytic `` hedgehog '' solution with spherically - symmetric energy and charge distributions , and the charge - two solution has an axially - symmetric ring - like solution .    in order to find the stable rotating solutions of the model , we assume for simplicity that any stable solution would rotate around the axis of angular momentum ( which is taken to be the @xmath59 direction ) with some angular velocity @xmath60 .",
    "the rotating solutions thus take the form .",
    "the energy functional to be minimized is [ eq : eomega ] e= e_+ , where @xmath61 is the ratio of the angular momentum of the skyrmion to its angular velocity , or its `` moment of inertia '' , given by i = 14 b ( ( _ ) ^2 + ^2 ( _ _ ) ^2 ) .",
    "since the euler - lagrange equations derived from the energy functional ( [ eq : eomega ] ) are non - linear _ pde _ s , in general the minimal energy configurations can only be obtained with the aid of numerical techniques . in what follows",
    ", we obtain the minimal energy configurations which correspond to rotating skyrmion solutions , using a full - field relaxation method , in which the domain @xmath44 is discretized to a spherical grid  @xmath62 grid points for @xmath49 and @xmath62 points for @xmath51 .",

    "= ( b , b , ) , where @xmath55 is the topological charge of the skyrmion in question .",
    "the energy of the baby skyrmion is then minimized by repeating the following steps : a point @xmath63 on the grid is chosen at random , along with one of the three components of the field @xmath64 .",
    "the chosen component is then shifted by a value @xmath65 chosen uniformly from the segment @xmath66 $ ] where @xmath67 initially .",
    "the field triplet is then normalized and the change in energy is calculated .",
    "if the energy decreases , the modification of the field is accepted and otherwise it is discarded .",
    "the procedure is repeated while the value of @xmath68 is gradually decreased throughout the procedure .",
    "this is done until no further decrease in energy is observed .",
    "one undesired feature of this minimization scheme is that it can get stuck at a local minimum .",
    "this problem can be resolved by using the `` simulated annealing '' algorithm @xcite , which in fact has been successfully implemented before , in obtaining the minimal energy configurations of static two and three dimensional skyrmions @xcite .",
    "the algorithm comprises of repeated applications of a metropolis algorithm with a gradually decreasing temperature , based on the fact that when a physical system is slowly cooled down , reaching thermal equilibrium at each temperature , it will end up in its ground state .",
    "this algorithm , however , is much more expensive in terms of computer time .",
    "we therefore employ it only on a representative sample of the parameter space , just as a check on our results , which correspond to a metropolis algorithm of zero temperature .      in what follows we present the results obtained by the minimization scheme described in the previous section to the rotating solutions of the model in the charge - one and charge - two sectors , which as mentioned above are rotationally - symmetric . for simplicity",
    ", we fix the parameter @xmath69 at @xmath70 although other @xmath69 values were tested as well , yielding qualitatively similar solutions .      in perfect analogy with the self - gravitating ellipsoid discussed in the introduction , the rotating charge - one skyrmion , which has spherically - symmetric energy and charge distributions in the static limit ( fig .",

    "<S> we study the phenomenon of spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry ( sbrs ) in the rotating solutions of two types of baby skyrme models . in the first </S>",
    "<S> the domain is a two - sphere and in the other , the skyrmions are confined to the interior of a unit disk . </S>",
    "<S> numerical full - field results show that when the angular momentum of the skyrmions increases above a certain critical value , the rotational symmetry of the solutions is broken and the minimal energy configurations become less symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a possible mechanism as to why sbrs is present in the rotating solutions of these models , while it is not observed in the ` usual ' baby skyrme model . </S>",
    "<S> our results might be relevant for a qualitative understanding of the non - spherical deformation of excited nucleons with high orbital angular momentum . </S>"
