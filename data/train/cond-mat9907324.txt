    "the scaling equation of state near a critical point provides fundamental information on the critical behaviour of a thermodynamic system . for bulk ising - like systems accurate predictions",
    "have been made recently @xcite on the basis of the @xmath0 field theory in three dimensions .",
    "testing these predictions by monte carlo simulations @xcite would be of considerable interest .",
    "such simulations , however , are necessarily made only for finite systems and thus phenomenological concepts like finite - size scaling @xcite are needed to perform extrapolations from mesoscopic lattices .    in order to test the theory in a more conclusive way it is desirable to go beyond the phenomenological finite - size scaling concept and to calculate explicitly the finite - size effects on the equation of state , i.e. , on the magnetization as a function of the temperature @xmath21 and external field @xmath4 in a finite geometry . although such field - theoretic calculations @xcite are perturbative and not exact they have been found to be in good agreement with the mc simulations .",
    "so far the calculations of thermodynamic quantities were restricted to the case of zero external field @xmath4 . at finite @xmath4 ,",
    "only the order - parameter distribution function was calculated @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we extend these calculations to the equation of state of the three - dimensional ising model in a finite cubic geometry at finite @xmath4 . for simplicity",
    "these calculations are performed at infinite cutoff and thus our results neglect lattice effects .",
    "the latter have been shown @xcite to yield ( exponentially small ) non - universal non - scaling contributions . here",
    "we focus our interest on the universal scaling part of the equation of state .",
    "our theory predicts non - monotonic effects in the @xmath4 dependence of the equation of state which we then confirm with surprisingly good agreement by standard monte carlo simulations .",
    "the identification of such non - monotonic effects is of great practical importance .",
    "if , for example , the critical temperature @xmath22 of a lattice with @xmath23 sites in three dimensions varies asymptotically as @xmath24 with some correlation length exponent @xmath25 , then a plot of the numerical @xmath22 versus @xmath26 gives the extrapolated @xmath27 as an intercept . if , however , higher order terms make the curve @xmath22 non - monotonic , then such a plot for finite @xmath5 , where the non - monotonicity is not yet visible , would give a wrong estimate for @xmath27 .",
    "similar effects would make estimates of other quantities unreliable , and there exist examples of such estimates in the literature .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 model with the standard landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian @xmath28\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a one - component field in a finite cube of volume @xmath30 and @xmath4 is a homogeneous external field .",
    "we assume periodic boundary conditions .",
    "accordingly we have @xmath31 where the summation @xmath32 runs over discrete @xmath33 vectors with componets @xmath34 in the range @xmath35 , i.e. , with a sharp cutoff @xmath36 .",
    "the temperature enters through @xmath37 .",
    "as pointed out recently @xcite the hamiltonian ( 1 ) for periodic boundary conditions with a sharp cutoff @xmath36 does not correctly describe the exponential size dependence of physical quantities of finite lattice models in the region @xmath38 . instead of ( 1 ) , a modified continuum hamiltonian with a smooth cutoff @xcite would be more appropriate .",
    "even better would be to employ the lattice version of the @xmath0 theory to describe the non - scaling lattice effects of finite ising models in the region @xmath38 . in the present paper , however , we shall neglect such effects by taking the limit @xmath39 ( see below ) .",
    "the fluctuating homogeneous part of the order - parameter of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) is @xmath40 .",
    "as previously @xcite @xmath41 is decomposed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 includes all inhomogeneous modes @xmath44 the order - parameter distribution function @xmath45 is defined by functional integration over @xmath46 , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the partition function of system .",
    "this distribution function depends also on the cutoff @xmath36 which implies non - scaling finite - size effects @xcite . from the order - parameter distribution function",
    "@xmath49 we can calculate the magnetization @xmath50    the functional integration over @xmath46 in eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) can only be done perturbatively @xcite . recently",
    "a novel perturbation approach was presented @xcite . using this approach",

    "we have taken the bulk parameters @xmath84 from ref.@xcite . from ref.@xcite",
    "we have taken the bulk amplitudes @xmath85 in units of the lattice constant ( of the sc ising model ) and the bulk critical exponents @xmath86 .",
    "thus our determination of the scaling function @xmath7 does not require a new adjustment of nonuniversal parameters .",
    "taking the limit @xmath87 at fixed @xmath88 , we obtain the scaling form of the bulk equation of state @xmath89 at @xmath90 we find from eqs .",
    "( 23)-(27 ) @xmath91 in three dimensions ( in units of the lattice constant ) .",
    "standard heat bath techniques were used for the glauber kinetic ising model , with multi - spin coding ( 16 spins in each 64-bit computer word ) . since the effect could be seen best in lattices of intermediate size @xmath92 for @xmath93 spins , memory requirements were tiny and only trivial parallelization by replication , not by domain decomposition , was used .",
    "however , thousands of hours of processor time were needed since we see the non - monotonic effects clearly in our figure if @xmath94 is plotted .",
    "the exponent @xmath95 is nearly five and thus five percent accuracy in @xmath94 requires one percent accuracy in the directly simulated magnetization @xmath1 .    earlier simulations by the same author and algorithm @xcite did not show the non - monotonic effects at @xmath96 because they were not searched for ; at that time the field - theoretical predictions presented above were not yet known .",
    "but even if they had been known it is doubtful that with the intel paragon used in @xcite instead of the cray - t3e now the non - monotonic trends would have been seen in about the same computer time .",
    "because of the limited system size , errors in the magnetization of order 1 + const/@xmath97 1 + const/@xmath98 are expected ; in light of these errors the agreement to be presented now is surprisingly good .",
    "figure 1 compares our monte carlo results for @xmath99 and @xmath100 spins with our theoretical predictions , eqs .",
    "( 23)-(26 ) , and shows good quantitative agreement ; below @xmath6 a pronounced peak is seen in the scaling function ( fig.1a ) , at @xmath6 it is somewhat weaker ( fig.1b ) , above @xmath6 it is barely visible ( fig.1c ) , and far above @xmath6 ( fig.1d ) it has vanished .",
    "the simulations , which at @xmath96 have an accuracy of the order of one and five percent for @xmath101 and 80 , respectively , agree nicely with the theoretical predictions .",
    "( far above @xmath6 therefore no simulations were made . )",
    "thus , if one tries to determine the bulk critical amplitude of @xmath94 at the critical isotherm , then with varying @xmath5 at a fixed field one first gets a too small value ( left border of the figures ) , then a too high value ( peak ) , and then a roughly correct value ( plateau in the right part of the figure ) .",
    "these non - monotonicities do @xmath102 vanish if we take the lattices large enough .",
    "they are part of the asymptotic scaling function and thus whatever lattice size @xmath5 we take there will be a field @xmath103 where @xmath94 has a maximum and near which it thus varies non - monotonically with @xmath5 .",
    "we also tested the prediction of @xcite that for fixed @xmath104 the leading finite - size deviation from the bulk value of @xmath1 should vanish exponentially in @xmath5 , and not with a power law @xmath105 ( as predicted by perturbation theory based on the separation of the zero - mode [ 4 - 7 ] ) .",
    "2a shows again non - monotonic behaviour , in both three and five dimensions .",
    "but only in three dimensions these data are accurate enough to distinguish between a tail varying exponentially and one @xmath105 ; fig.2b clearly supports the theoretically predicted @xcite exponential variation .",
    "( these three - dimensional data were taken with ito s fast algorithm @xcite . )    in order to make contact with bulk properties we also used simulations at the critical isotherm with @xmath106 spins @xcite . from the simulations we obtain the bulk value of @xmath94 as @xmath107 .",
    "our field - theoretic result in eq .",
    "( 28 ) is in very good agreement with this value .",
    "it is interesting to compare our simulation result also with other bulk theories . from series expansion zinn and fisher @xcite obtained @xmath108 for the amplitude of the bulk susceptibility at the critical isotherm @xmath109 with @xmath110",
    "this leads to @xmath111 according to the relation @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113 is also contained in the universal combination of amplitudes @xcite @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the amplitude of the bulk susceptibility @xmath116 above @xmath6 at @xmath117 and @xmath67 is the amplitude of the spontaneous magnetization @xmath118 below @xmath6 . using @xmath0 field theory at @xmath74 dimensions guida and zinn - justin @xcite have obtained @xmath119 .",
    "they also used the @xmath120 expansion and obtained @xmath121 at @xmath122 . using these values for @xmath123 and the high - temperature series expansion results @xcite @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 with @xmath127",

    "our simulations confirmed _ a posteriori _ our theoretical predictions of sect . 2 for the asymptotic finite - size effects in the three - dimensional ising model .",
    "the agreement in fig.1 is remarkable in view of the fact that the non - universal parameters of the theory were adjusted only to _ bulk _ parameters of the ising model at @xmath69 and not to any finite - size mc data .",
