    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies are believed to play an important role in the formation and evolution of much more luminous galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "dsphs are characterized by their low surface brightness , low total luminosity and spheroidal shapes which are consistent with their pressure - supported stellar kinematics  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "knowledge of dsph masses is essential for comparison with cosmological simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "good mass estimates help us to establish whether the paucity in the number of observed systems ( a few tens ) to the number of predicted satellite haloes ( several thousands ) represents a fundamental failure of our cosmological model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or whether it is simply telling us that galaxy formation is inefficient on small scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "recent studies have suggested that the dsph galaxies share a common mass within a certain radius @xcite .",
    "if confirmed , this would be an important clue to the processes which regulate the formation of the lowest luminosity galaxies .",
    "all mass estimates implicitly assume that contamination of the kinematic sample by foreground stars or unbound tidal tails is negligible , and that the system is in ( or close to ) virial equilibrium .",
    "since the mass of an equilibrium stellar system is proportional to its velocity dispersion squared , an over - estimate of the velocity dispersion will result in an inflated mass estimate .",
    "the assumption of virial equilibrium may be called into question if the system is tidally disrupting  @xcite .",
    "the recently discovered hercules dsph  @xcite , with an ellipticity of @xmath12 @xcite , is an example of a galaxy in which assumptions of equilibrium may be incorrect . in @xcite",
    "we showed that the mean velocity of the hercules dsph is embedded in the foreground dwarf star velocity distribution . in order to weed out the foreground dwarf stars we used the strmgren @xmath13 index .",
    "this index is able to clearly identify red - giant branch ( rgb ) stars redder than the horizontal branch , enabling a separation of rgb stars in the dsph galaxy and foreground dwarf stars . by weeding out the foreground contaminants we found that the dispersion for hercules is reduced from @xmath14 to @xmath15 . in this letter",
    "we explore the consequences of this finding .    in section  2 ,",
    "we derive a new mass for hercules and show that it is not consistent with a common mass scale for the dsphs . in section  3",
    ", we investigate the possibility of a velocity gradient in the kinematic data of hercules . in section  4",
    ", we discuss the relative importance of tides and dark matter in hercules .",
    "section  5 summarises our conclusions .",
    "we use the velocity dispersion , @xmath16 @xcite , to constrain the mass of the hercules dsph .",
    "we assume that the system is in dynamical equilibrium , is spherically symmetric , has an isotropic velocity distribution , and a flat velocity dispersion profile . with these assumptions , the jeans equation for the mass distribution ( eq .",
    "( 4.215 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) becomes : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the three - dimensional distance from the centre of the galaxy , @xmath19 is the de - projected stellar density profile and @xmath20 is the enclosed mass .",
    "we use the exponential profile from @xcite to describe the stellar density profile .",
    "the de - projected exponential profile is given by @xcite as ( setting @xmath21 in their eq .",
    "( 4 ) ) : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the exponential scale radius , related to the half - light radius as @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the central stellar density . solving eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) for @xmath20 using eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) yields @xmath26 using a half - light radius of @xmath27pc @xcite we solve eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) for @xmath28 pc , which corresponds to the outermost member in our kinematic sample ( table [ tab ] ) .",
    "we estimate the error in the mass using @xmath29 monte carlo realisations of the half - light radius , distance and velocity dispersion of hercules drawn from within the individual error bars on each parameter . in this way",
    ", we obtain @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the quoted errors are 1-@xmath31 limits from the monte carlo sampling . assuming a total luminosity of @xmath32 @xcite",
    ", we find a median mass - to - light ratio of @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "@xcite emphasise the importance of weeding out foreground , contaminating dwarf stars .",
    "this is particularly vital for the hercules dsph as its systemic velocity coincides with the bulk motion of dwarf stars in the milky way disk in the direction of hercules . using the contaminated velocity outliers",
    "also , the initial candidate selection for the velocities were chosen using colour - magnitude diagram cuts .",
    "even so , a significant fraction of foreground stars remain in this sample and are detected only through the use of the strmgren photometry .",
    "] velocity dispersion ( table [ tab ] ) we would obtain a mass of @xmath34 , almost a factor of four larger than the uncontaminated estimate .",
    "@xcite speculate that the mass within a fixed radius , 300pc , is approximately the same ( @xmath35 ) in all the observed dsphs .",
    "our revised velocity dispersion implies a mass within the inner 300 pc ( m@xmath36 ) of only @xmath37 .",
    "this indicates that hercules falls considerably below this `` common mass scale '' for dsphs .",
    "since 300 pc is also approximately the half - light radius , this implies that hercules also lies significantly off the @xcite enclosed half - light mass scaling relation .    to confirm that our result is not sensitive to our choice of surface brightness profile , we have repeated our calculation using a plummer profile with scale radius @xmath38  ( as used by *",
    "in this case we find m@xmath39 in agreement with the mass calculated above .",
    "if instead we use our contaminated velocity dispersion and the exponential surface density profile , we obtain m@xmath40 which agrees with the value presented in @xcite",
    ".    however , we note that @xcite used a dispersion of @xmath41 ( taken from * ? ? ? * ) to obtain their mass estimate .",
    "this is smaller than our contaminated value of @xmath42 , yet they obtain a similar median mass to us . if we use a dispersion of @xmath43 as they do , we obtain a mass @xmath44m@xmath3 .",
    "this is just consistent with their determination within our mutual error bars .",
    "we note that the median @xmath45 will depend on the details of the mass modelling procedure and so can be expected to differ between their study and ours ( matt walker priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "additionally , we have repeated our calculation of the mass within 300pc using a more recent estimate of the half - light radius , @xmath46pc , by @xcite .",
    "this half - light radius is smaller and gives a mass that is @xmath47 times more massive than the mass calculated using the half - light radius from @xcite .",
    "the presence of a velocity gradient in a dsph could either be indicative of an intrinsic rotation , or a sign of tidal interaction with the milky way . in this section ,",
    "we test for possible velocity gradients in hercules .    assuming that the rotation around the semi - minor axis ( in the ellipse that desribes the orientation of the dsph ) is more likely then around the semi - major axis we can define the `` semi - minor axis distance '' @xmath48 as the distance , perpendicular to the semi - minor axis , between the axis and the star . for each of the 18 rgb stars with radial velocities we calculate this distance for different position angles @xmath49 .",
    "we then derive the gradient , @xmath50 , and zeropoint , @xmath51 , by solving the following equation with a least - squares fit for each position angle , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the radial velocity measurement for each stars .",
    "the least - squares fit to this function yields a @xmath54 value for each @xmath49 ( fig . [",
    "fig2]a ) .",
    "the distribution enclosed by @xmath55 corresponds to @xmath56 for a normal distribution @xcite .",
    "we use this to obtain the error in the position angle which minimizes @xmath54 .",
    "we find a position angle of @xmath57 degrees with a velocity gradient of @xmath5kms@xmath6kpc@xmath6 , and a zeropoint of @xmath58 .",
    "we obtain a reduced @xmath54 of @xmath59 for our 18 stars with 2 degrees of freedom .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the significance of the velocity gradient using @xmath29 monte carlo realisations . in each realisation",
    ", we sample the velocity and spatial distributions independently .",
    "thus we scramble the correlation between velocity and position , while maintaining the original velocity distribution and spatial positions .",
    "this is valid as long as the phase space distribution function of the stars is separable ( which implies that the velocity dispersion is independent of radius ) . we determine the significance of the velocity gradient by computing the fraction of realisations that fail to produce a @xmath54 as low as the one calculated from the real data .",
    "we find a significance of the velocity gradient of 78 per cent ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "in the previous section we found tentative evidence for a velocity gradient in the hercules dsph .",
    "the peak - to - peak difference of @xmath61 within a radius of less than 1kpc could be interpreted as the effect of galactic tides @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite recently estimated the orbit of hercules based on the assumption that its elongation is tidally induced , and predicted a velocity gradient of at least @xmath62 which is consistent with our observed gradient .",
    "additionally , in @xcite we found that the spatial distribution of the hercules stars is asymmetric at @xmath630.5 kpc .",
    "there are three significant outlier stars to the south , but no corresponding members at this distance in either the northern or western fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "these three stars are unambiguously identified as rgb stars from strmgren photometry .",
    "we now consider the possibility that the velocity gradient and the positional outliers are evidence that hercules is being tidally disrupted , and use this information to obtain a second mass estimate for the system .",
    "the tidal radius of a dsph depends on the potential of the host galaxy , the potential of the dsph , the orbit of the dsph within the host galaxy and the orbit of the stars within the dsph ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we parameterise the milky way potential using the default model in @xcite , analysed in the galactic plane ; and the hercules potential using a generalised hernquist profile @xcite :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the total mass , @xmath66 the scalelength , and @xmath67 the central logarithmic cusp slope .",
    "we consider the ranges @xmath68kpc and @xmath69 .",
    "our results are not sensitive to these choices .",
    "the orbit of the hercules dsph is unknown but it currently lies at a distance of @xmath70kpc from the galactic centre , and has a heliocentric velocity of @xmath71 , which implies a galactocentric radial velocity of @xmath72 ( see eq .",
    "( 5 ) in * ? ? ?",
    "using the above potential model for the milky way and setting the tangential velocity component for hercules to zero , this gives us a minimum apocentre for hercules of @xmath73kpc .",
    "thus , we consider apocentre and pericentre ranges of @xmath74kpc and @xmath75kpc , respectively .",
    "@xcite find that photometric features are typically seen beyond the retrograde tidal radius .",
    "to proceed , we make the assumption that the outliers in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] indicate the location of the retrograde tidal radius of hercules , i.e. @xmath76pc . if we assume further that the tidal radius of hercules is set at the pericentre of its orbit , we can solve eq .",
    "( 7 ) of @xcite to calculate the mass , @xmath77 , of hercules as a function of its orbital pericentre @xmath78 , for our assumed ranges of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath79 .",
    "we calculate both its mass within @xmath10 ( @xmath80 ) and its mass within 433pc ( @xmath81 ) which can then be compared with our mass estimate based on the spherical jeans equation ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the results of this calculation are given in fig .",
    "the horizontal light grey band marks @xmath82 , the dark grey band marks @xmath81 and the medium grey band marks @xmath80 .",
    "the vertical solid and dashed lines mark the pericentres at which @xmath83 .",
    "the width of the tidal mass bands is due to the unknowns : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath79 .",
    "however , to lowest order @xmath10 depends only on the mean density enclosed within it , and so these bands are narrow . for this reason",
    ", we obtain an estimate of both the orbital pericentre of hercules ( @xmath84kpc ) and its mass within the tidal radius ( @xmath85m@xmath3 ) .",
    "the primary source of error on both of these quantities is our assumed tidal radius @xmath10 .",
    "empirically we derive scalings of :    @xmath86    with @xmath87 over the range @xmath88$]kpc , and :    @xmath89    with @xmath90 over the same range .",
    "if we assume @xmath91 pc , we obtain a similar estimate of the pericentric distance as that obtained by @xcite .",
    "we have shown that our hercules data are consistent with the presence of dark matter .",
    "we now consider whether models without dark matter could also reproduce the data .",
    "the most extreme scenario is that hercules is disintegrating and its velocity dispersion arises solely due to the motion of its unbound member stars .",
    "if so , it will rapidly become unobservable ( i.e. reach a lower surface brightness than the detection limit of the sdss ) .",
    "hercules has a surface brightness of @xmath92 mag arcsec@xmath93 @xcite .",
    "if the unbound stars are moving away from hercules at a velocity equal to the velocity dispersion ( @xmath15 ) it would require only @xmath94 years for the hercules dsph to fall below the detection limit of sdss  ( @xmath95 * ? ? ?",
    "given this short timescale , it is very unlikely that we would observe hercules at this phase of its evolution .    @xcite simulated the disruption of the uma ii dsph . using a model that does not distinguish between luminous and dark matter they simulate the surface brightness , velocity dispersion and the mean radial velocity for uma ii after 9 , 10 and 11gyr ( their fig .",
    "9 ) .    in the absence of dark matter ,",
    "the equilibrium velocity dispersion ( i.e. @xmath96 ) for the hercules dsph would be @xmath97 , assuming a stellar mass of @xmath98 and a radius equal to the observed half - light radius ( @xmath99pc ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is much lower than the measured velocity dispersion of @xmath100 .",
    "we conclude that the hercules dsph can only be a dark matter free system if its velocity dispersion has been inflated significantly - i.e. if it is in the advanced stages of tidal disruption .",
    "however , in the simulations of @xcite the evolutionary phase in which a tidal remnant exhibits both an inflated velocity dispersion and a velocity gradient , and remains centrally concentrated is very short . within @xmath101gyr",
    "the system goes from bound , with almost no signs of tidal disturbance , to complete disruption .",
    "( we note that @xcite performed simulations of dsph galaxies without dark matter , and found that it is possible to obtain long - lived remnants whose properties are remarkably similar to those of hercules in terms of velocity dispersion and velocity gradient ( see his fig .",
    "however , the remnants simulated by @xcite are significantly more luminous than the hercules dsph . based on the simulations of @xcite",
    ", it seems unlikely that lower luminosity , purely stellar remnants with the correct properties could survive for a significant time . )",
    "it seems difficult to understand hercules without dark matter .",
    "however , it could be dark matter dominated _ and _ experiencing significant tidal disturbance . in this case",
    ", our simple jeans analysis may have over - estimated its mass and hercules might lie even further away from a possible common mass scale for the dsph galaxies .",
    "we have calculated the mass of the hercules dsph using the new velocity dispersion for the system obtained by @xcite .",
    "we find that the mass within the volume enclosed by our observed stars is @xmath102 , leading to a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "interestingly , the mass within 300pc is significantly lower than the `` common mass scale '' found by @xcite , suggesting that hercules does not share the halo properties seen in other dsphs .",
    "we found tentative evidence for a velocity gradient of @xmath104kms@xmath6kpc@xmath6 , and evidence of an asymmetric extension in the light distribution at @xmath105kpc .",
    "we explored the hypothesis that these features are due to tidal interactions with the milky way . assuming a tidal radius of @xmath106pc",
