    "spacetime noncommutativity is one of the key new hints which follow from recent developments in quantum field theory .",

    "planck cell_. it was von neumann who first attempted to rigorously describe such a quantum `` space '' and he called this study `` pointless geometry '' , referring to the fact that the notion of a point in a quantum phase space is meaningless because of the heisenberg uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics .",
    "this led to the theory of von neumann algebras and was essentially the birth of _ noncommutative geometry _ , referring to the study of topological spaces whose commutative @xmath4-algebras of functions are replaced by noncommutative algebras @xcite .",
    "the idea of noncommutative geometry was revived in the eighties by connes @xcite and others , who generalized the notion of a differential structure to the noncommutative setting , i.e. to arbitrary @xmath5-algebras .",
    "a theory on a noncommutative space replaces the noncommutativity of operators associated to spacetime coordinates with a deformation of the algebra of functions defined on spacetime . in this context classical general relativity",
    "would break down at the planck scale because spacetime would no longer be described by a differentiable manifold , and at these length scales quantum gravitational fluctuations become large and can not be ignored .",
    "we stress , however , that the form of noncommutative geometry we are interested in is not directly related to current string theories ( see below ) .    in the past few years",
    "several authors @xcite , including some of the present authors @xcite , have considered the possible effects of noncommutative geometry and planck scale physics in cosmology . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that deformation of spacetime and/or phase space algebras may lead to several interesting features in the power spectrum of primordial perturbations produced during the inflationary era @xcite . in all these investigations , however , @xmath6 has been taken to be constant , or with an a - priori modelled time evolution . in view of general covariance",
    "one may expect that @xmath7 should be rather considered as a dynamical tensor , coupled to gravity and possibly affecting the cosmological evolution of the early universe .",
    "this is actually a crucial point which deserves a thorough treatment , here summarized by relying in part upon ref .",
    "@xcite . on the one hand",
    ", it is true that , if one looks at the interplay between string theory and noncommutative geometry , one has to consider a constant @xmath8-field and hence a constant @xmath6 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the commutator of the @xmath9 is a tensor , whose transformation under boosts yields nonvanishing spacetime components .",
    "moreover , possible violations of unitarity are taken care of by imposing the conditions @xcite @xmath10 from the point of view of general formalism , it is therefore legitimate to address the question of whether a broader noncommutative picture can be consistently built .",
    "this implies a departure from current models which only exploit a constant @xmath6 , and suggests starting from a nonlocal action functional with @xmath11 product of fields in the presence of nonvanishing spacetime curvature @xcite .",
    "we therefore assume , hereafter , that the background geometry remains a classical pseudo - riemannian geometry endowed with a levi - civita connection @xmath12 , while the @xmath11 product of scalar fields at the same spacetime point is defined by @xcite @xmath13 similarly , having treated classically the geometry , we assume for tensor fields that @xmath14 where @xmath15 as is stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the occurrence of covariant derivatives in our definitions ( 1.1 ) and ( 1.3 ) spoils associativity of the @xmath11 product .",
    "however , noncommutative effects are already present at quadratic order in @xmath6 , and our @xmath6 will be taken to be sufficiently small so that higher order terms in the action functional are negligible .",
    "another important goal to be pursued is a fully consistent study of primordial perturbations , which should take into account the @xmath7 perturbations as well , generalizing the formalism of gauge - invariant perturbations @xcite to anisotropic background metrics .    as a first step in this programme ,",
    "in this paper we discuss the possible dynamical evolution of a background , time - dependent antisymmetric tensor @xcite @xcite in two possible scenarios : a free massless @xmath2 in presence of a cosmological constant , the latter being introduced as the easiest way to trigger an inflationary dynamics , and a more general scenario where the noncommutative field @xmath6 is coupled to a scalar inflaton .",
    "as mentioned the presence of @xmath2 breaks the isotropy of the universe , and hence only spatial homogeneity is preserved , leading in turn to a dependence of @xmath2 on time only . in this framework",
    "the appropriate geometry for the universe is therefore a bianchi i model . in sec .",
    "ii we obtain a nonlinear system of the background equations in the presence of inflaton plus a coupling term between inflaton and @xmath16 , and the energy - momentum tensor . in sec .",
    "iii we consider the simpler cosmological term model which however can be worked out analytically , at least for those initial conditions which are of some interest and may lead to an early stage where the energy - momentum tensor is dominated by @xmath7 .",
    "concluding remarks and open problems are presented in sec .",
    "iv , while relevant details are given in the appendix .",
    "in order to describe a field dynamics which might lead to anisotropy in the early universe , the appropriate model is a bianchi i universe ( as we stated before ) if one wants to preserve the spatial homogeneity . in this case",
    "the line element can be written as @xmath17 and correspondingly the nonvanishing connection coefficents are ( no summation over @xmath18 is here meant ) @xmath19 and for the ricci tensor one has @xmath20 we consider a model in which there are both the antisymmetric tensor responsible of noncommutativity of spacetime and a minimally coupled massive scalar field which drives the inflation .",
    "the corresponding nonlocal action reads @xmath21 \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{(2.4)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the part involving @xmath22 is here introduced to mimic a ` time - dependent ' mass term for @xmath6 , and @xmath23 is the field strength associated to the antisymmetric tensor @xmath24 ( hereafter , greek indices run from @xmath25 through @xmath26 , whereas latin indices run from @xmath27 through @xmath26 ) .",
    "it should be noticed that the kinetic term for @xmath28 is inspired by a generalization of the maxwell theory @xcite and that in eq.([(2.5 ) ] ) only the effects of partial derivatives survive .",
    "now , by virtue of the definitions ( 1.1)(1.3 ) , one finds @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 thus , to second order in @xmath6 , which is relevant since @xmath6 is taken to be sufficiently small , only kinetic and potential term for the scalar field contribute , but with vanishing coefficient , since the former changes by the amount @xcite ( integration by parts yields also a third term which however vanishes if @xmath32 only ) @xmath33\\nabla_{\\sigma } \\nabla^{\\tau}\\varphi ) \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; , \\label{(2.9)}\\ ] ] and the latter changes by the amount @xcite @xmath34 since @xmath35 depends only on the time variable , both ( 2.9 ) and ( 2.10 ) vanish in our bianchi i background .",

    "moreover , @xmath62 dominates as well , i.e. , there is anisotropy . outside this range , @xmath44 approaches zero and @xmath35 dominates driving the isotropization , which can be seen in the figures where @xmath62 and @xmath63 reach the same constant value .",

    "ramond field @xmath68 via the duality transformation @xmath69 , with @xmath70 the volume four - form",
    ". actually , since we are assuming homogeneity and a purely time - dependent @xmath0 field this implies a time - independent @xmath68 field with a linear dependence on spatial coordinates ( see eq .",
    "( 3.15 ) ) .",
    "using the results of the previous section in the particular case we are considering , the resulting equations of motion are @xmath71 and the energy - momentum tensor reads @xmath72 as in the previous section , we assume bianchi i geometry .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eq : theta1 ] ) and ( [ eq : metric1 ] ) now read @xmath73 unlike the previous section , eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta0i ] ) is now replaced by a gauge - fixing condition . in the following",
    "we will use the gauge @xmath74 = 0 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the admissibility of this gauge fixing is reported in the appendix .",
    "the effect of ( [ eq2:thetaij ] ) and ( [ eq2:rij ] ) is to restrict severely the possible choice of initial conditions for @xmath75 . in particular either all @xmath76 values",
    "vanish and thus @xmath43 is a constant tensor , or at most only one component @xmath76 is nonvanishing .",
    "since the antisymmetric tensor enters the field equations only through its first- and second - order time derivatives the case of a constant @xmath0-tensor reduces to a pure @xmath77-term cosmology and is thus uninteresting for our analysis .",
    "we therefore consider the case @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and we eventually get @xmath80 equation ( [ eq2:theta12 ] ) determines the behavior of @xmath44 in terms of the scale factors @xmath81 where in ( [ theta12scale ] ) , by virtue of the arbitrariness in the choice of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we have assumed , without loss of generality , @xmath84 .",
    "notice that this immediately gives the spacetime dependence of the kalb ",
    "ramond scalar field @xmath85 where , according to ( 2.1 ) , @xmath86 denotes the longitudinal spatial coordinate .",
    "the equation ( [ chi ] ) is actually consistent with spatial homogeneity , while it breaks isotropy .",
    "the previous equations can be recast in a simpler and more useful form by introducing the variable @xmath87 which represents the average e - folding .",
    "hence one gets @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "it is also convenient to set @xmath91 and hence from ( [ xi ] ) @xmath92 furthermore , we introduce the mean hubble parameter , @xmath93 , and the asymmetry function @xmath94 . since @xmath95 , eqs .",
    "( 3.20 ) and ( 3.21 ) yield @xmath96 .",
    "thus one gets @xmath97 where the last equation is the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "actually the functional dependence of @xmath98 in terms of @xmath99 and @xmath100 can be already obtained by its very definition @xmath101 showing that @xmath102 is directly related to the isotropy breaking . in the following",

    "the equation ( [ 1p ] ) is a first - order inhomogeneous equation whose solution reads @xmath107 which , together with ( [ hversusomega ] ) , gives the hubble parameters in terms of the function @xmath108 .",
    "the latter can be determined as the solution of a second - order differential equation , obtained by inserting ( 3.25 ) into the differential equation ( 3.23 ) and the hamiltonian constraint ( 3.24 ) .",
    "the latter operation yields @xmath109 if the differential equation ( 3.22 ) is also exploited to express @xmath110 , we eventually find @xmath111 with initial conditions @xmath96 , @xmath112 .",
    "this equation can be hardly solved analytically in the general case , but it reduces to much simpler forms in the two regimes , when either the cosmological constant or the @xmath113 fields dominate the energy - momentum tensor . at very early times",
    "the latter is likely to be largely the dominant component .",
    "we can rewrite the parameter @xmath114 as @xmath115 , with @xmath116 the scale where the classical picture of spacetime manifold breaks down .",
    "the order of magnitude of @xmath77 can be instead constrained by the fact that it drives inflation in the late stages , and represents in the slow - roll approximation the potential of the inflaton field .",
    "this is severely bounded by the fact that it should account for the correct amplitude of primordial perturbations .",
    "for example , for a polynomial potential @xmath117 , the requirement of slow - roll dynamics and perturbation amplitudes of the order of @xmath118 gives @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "as long as @xmath120 the value of @xmath77 is several orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath114 , so in this case the early dynamics is fully determined by @xmath113 .",

    "<S> this paper investigates the possible cosmological implications of the presence of an antisymmetric tensor field @xmath0 related to a lack of commutativity of spacetime coordinates at the planck era . for this purpose , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is promoted to a dynamical variable , inspired by tensor formalism . by working to quadratic order in @xmath0 , we study the field equations in a bianchi i universe in two models : an antisymmetric tensor plus scalar field coupled to gravity , or a cosmological constant and a free massless antisymmetric tensor . in the first scenario </S>",
    "<S> , numerical integration shows that , in the very early universe , the effects of the antisymmetric tensor can prevail on the scalar field , while at late times the former approaches zero and the latter drives the isotropization of the universe . in the second model , an approximate solution is obtained of a nonlinear ordinary differential equation which shows how the mean hubble parameter and the difference between longitudinal and orthogonal hubble parameter evolve in the early universe . </S>"
