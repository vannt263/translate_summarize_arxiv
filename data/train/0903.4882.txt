    "heteroepitaxy is the process of slow deposition of a film of one or more crystalline materials on a crystalline substrate of a different material .",
    "the classical examples of film / substrate combinations include , for example ge / si , inas / gaas , and inp / gaas .",
    "the natural lattice spacing between the film and the substrate differ by a few percent resulting in elastic stress . consequently",
    ", as the film grows the elastic energy builds up .",
    "the formation of 3d islands reduces the elastic energy by relieving stress at the cost of increased surface energy . in many cases these islands",
    "are on the order of tens of nanometers and are referred to as quantum dots .",
    "these quantum dot materials are of importance in construction of some optoelectronic devices .    the theory of island formation is well understood in the context of asaro - tiller - grinfeld instability @xcite .",
    "this explains the instability of a single component stressed film to perturbations of the flat surface .",
    "the flat surface is unstable under sufficiently long wavelength perturbations .",
    "these perturbations grow through mass transport on the surface , along the free energy gradients , leading to formation of surface ripples that later grow into large islands with stress concentration in the valleys .",
    "the theory however fails to explain an experimental observation , namely in many cases the film first grows in a layer - by - layer fashion until it reaches a certain critical thickness . then islands form on top of this layer ( known as the wetting layer ) .",
    "this mode of growth is known as the stranski krastonov ( sk ) growth mode@xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated experimentally by cullis and co workers @xcite , that the intermixing between the film and substrate is of importance .",
    "the presence of compositional non - uniformity and the dilution of the film by substrate material can have a stabilizing effects . moreover",
    "the presence of vertical and lateral segregation in the case of alloy films @xcite , can further change the nature of the instability .",
    "subsequently , tu and tersoff@xcite , using a continuum model developed by spencer et al@xcite , argued that stranski krastonov growth is a kinetic effect and the wetting layer is not stable .",
    "a crucial aspect of their proposal is the intermixing that occurs between the film and the substrate .",
    "another important example in which intermixing occurs on very large length scales is the self assembly of stacked quantum dots . here",
    "the dominant mechanism of intermixing results from the deposition process in which several layers of one material deposited which are followed by several layers of another material and so on .",
    "since the materials are not lattice matched elastic strain develops and it is observed that the film forms quantum dots . the quantum dots in different layers align themselves to self assemble into stacked quantum dots .",
    "intermixing of the film material and the capping layer needs to be addressed in this situation . some related work , both experimental and computational , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is clear that the simulation of strained heteroepitaxial growth with intermixing has important applications .",
    "one reasonably popular approach is based on numerical solution of continuum equations .",
    "indeed recent work in this direction @xcite has been able to capture many aspects of the film growth .",
    "another approach is based on kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) .",
    "since kmc is based on an atomistic scale it is typically slower than a continuum formulation .",
    "on the other hand , kmc not only captures all the physical effects modeled by continuum approach but can naturally include discrete and stochastic effects such as nucleation , surface roughness , and intermixing .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a kmc model of strained heteroepitaxial growth with intermixing and an algorithm for its efficient simulation .",
    "we extended the model proposed by orr et al @xcite and lam , lee , & sander @xcite to include intermixing .",
    "this model is a solid - on - solid bond counting scheme@xcite in which elastic interaction are included using a ball and spring model .",
    "the efficient simulation of this model represents the major contribution of this paper .",
    "one computational bottle neck for the simulation of strained film growth is the repeated calculation of elastic field . in this paper",
    "we address this by the inclusion of intermixing into the multigrid - fourier method developed by russo & smereka@xcite .",
    "in addition we present a cleaner way to incorporate the substrate into the multigrid method and simplify the coarse - graining and prolongation operators .",
    "as it turns out , for the kmc model used here , the change in total elastic energy , when a surface atom is removed , is needed .",
    "it was established by schulze & smereka@xcite that despite the long range nature of elastic interactions one can accurately compute this energy change by local calculations . in this work",
    ", we have verified that this approach also works in case of intermixing .",
    "in addition we have presented numerical evidence that the asymptotic expressions presented in ref .",
    "@xcite remain valid in the case of intermixing .",
    "another computational bottleneck is the computation of the rates . in order to implement rejection - free kmc one must know the hopping rates for all the atoms . to accomplish this",
    "one would have to compute the change in elastic energy that occurs when each and every atom is removed .",
    "this would be prohibitively expensive .",
    "fortunately , it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that the current elastic energy density can be used to provide fairly sharp upper bounds on the change in elastic energy . these can be used to provide a rejection - reduced kmc algorithm .",
    "here we demonstrate that this approach works well for the intermixing case . in our simulations",
    "the rejection rate is approximately between .5 and 5 percent .    in the following sections we explain the kmc model and",
    "present our algorithm to calculate the elastic displacement field and elastic energy in the case of a multicomponent film .",
    "some results are presented that illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm ; namely , the effects of intermixing on the morphology of a growing strained film and a simulation illustrating the self - assembly of stacked quantum dots . to the best of our knowledge",
    "these results are the first kinetic monte carlo simulations of strained heteroepitaxial growth with intermixing .",
    "our model is based on the solid - on - solid model presented by orr et al @xcite and lam et al @xcite .",
    "we consider a semi - infinite substrate which is initially composed of a single component . for ease of exposition we shall refer to the substrate material as silicon .",
    "the deposited material will be composed of a prescribed mixture of silicon and germanium .",
    "the model and algorithm will be detailed for a two component film but it is not limited to this . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to 1 + 1 dimensions . the atoms in the crystal occupy sites on a simple cubic crystal , within the solid - on - solid framework ( no overhanging atoms ) .",
    "therefore the height of the surface is a function of the horizontal coordinate denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "each atom in the lattice is bonded with its nearest ( 4 possible ) and next to nearest neighbors ( 4 possible ) by bonds of strength @xmath1 .",
    "the elastic interactions are modeled by means of a ball and spring system .",
    "each atom on the lattice is connected to its nearest and next to nearest neighbors by hookean springs .",
    "the lateral and vertical springs have a spring constant of @xmath2 and the diagonal springs @xmath3 .",
    "we choose @xmath4 corresponding to the isotropic case @xcite .",
    "the natural bond lengths ( lattice spacing ) are denoted by @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , for si - si , si - ge and ge - si bonds respectively . if these quantities are equal there are no forces due to lattice mismatch and hence no elastic energy in the crystal . in general since @xmath8 forces do arise .",
    "this is addressed in detail in the next section .",
    "the crystal evolves by rearranging itself through motion of surface atoms . by virtue of the solid - on - solid assumption",
    "each surface atom is uniquely specified by @xmath0 ( the horizontal component ) and this is what we mean when we specify the @xmath0th surface atom .",
    "the hopping rate of the @xmath0th surface atom is modeled by @xmath9\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the change in the total energy when removing the @xmath0th surface atom , @xmath11 is the attempt frequency , @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath13 is the absolute temperature .",
    "we write the total energy as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the total chemical energy and @xmath16 is the total elastic energy .",
    "the chemical energy can be thought of as the contribution to the total energy from local interactions whereas @xmath16 is the contribution by the long range interactions .",
    "since we are assuming that the bond energy is the same for nearest and next to nearest neighbors , it follows that @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total number of nearest and next to nearest neighbors .",
    "therefore , the change in total energy is given by @xmath19 the calculation of @xmath20 is described in the next two sections .",
    "the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath11 will be chosen to match the adatom diffusion rate to experimental values .",
    "when an atom hops it moves to another surface site whose horizontal coordinate changes by @xmath22 , with equal probability . as a simplification we shall ignore the elastic contribution to the energy barrier for adatoms",
    "; therefore the rates we shall use are @xmath23 r_0 \\exp \\left(\\displaystyle { \\frac{-n \\gamma   + \\delta w + e_0}{k_b t } }   \\right ) & \\quad { \\mbox{if}}\\quad n>3   \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{rate_normal_eqn}\\ ] ] the number 3 corresponds to the number of bonds of an adatom on a flat terrace .",
    "the adatoms with less than 3 bonds are assumed to hop at the same rate as other adatoms .",
    "this will reduces the computational time significantly .",
    "no significant change is observed in the results due to this treatement for the adatoms .",
    "finally we deposit atoms at a rate of @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the deposition rate in monolayers per unit time and @xmath26 is the total number of sites in the horizontal direction .    the model by lam",
    "et al @xcite allowed the possibility of large hops with @xmath11 adjusted to correct for the large hop size .",
    "this greatly improved the computational speed but at the same time not changing the results too much .",
    "however in the case of intermixing we observed that the inclusion of this feature significantly retarded intermixing .",
    "hence large hop strategy was not adopted in this work .",
    "the calculation of the hopping rate of an atom involves the computation of elastic energy of the crystal in different configurations .",
    "the elastic energy is merely the sum total of the energy stored in each spring when the crystal is in mechanical equilibrium .",
    "the energy in a harmonic spring is proportional to the square of the change in length of the spring ( relative to natural length ) .",
    "this is computed in terms of the displacements of the atoms from a reference configuration .",
    "the computational challenge is quickly computing the equilibrium displacements of the atoms .",
    "the first step toward the calculation of the elastic energy is the choice of a reference configuration .",
    "the displacements of atoms are calculated with respect to this reference configuration .",
    "we choose this to be a cubic lattice , whose lattice spacing equals that of pure substrate material .",
    "this ensures that the substrate is devoid of any forces in the reference state .",
    "thus two atoms in the reference configuration are a distance @xmath5 apart .",
    "the natural lattice spacing however depends on the nature of the two atoms .",
    "the natural lattice spacing is @xmath27 , and @xmath7 , when the two atoms are si - si , ge - si , and ge - ge respectively .",
