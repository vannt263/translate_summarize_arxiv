    "resilient_. we answer this question by giving a complete characterization of resilient sets . in spite of the fact that the question is already quite interesting and natural in the 2-dimensional case , we will see that the characterization we give applies in any number of dimensions .",
    "the characterization we give is a bit unusual in its form ; in a certain sense , it is one part convex geometry , one part ` fractal ' geometry .",
    "while we characterize convex resilient sets ( we will see this includes all bounded resilient sets ) with simple geometric constraints , the rest of the characterization is a correspondence between certain resilient sets and ` scale - invariant ' sets .",
    "for example , figure [ f.ckoch ] shows a resilient set related to the koch snowflake . notice that this set ` gets bigger ' when it is eroded .    before proceeding , lets consider some simple bounded examples from the plane .",

    "this suggests our definition of an inscribed ball of a convex body :    a ( closed ) ball @xmath13 is _ inscribed _ in the convex body @xmath1 if @xmath14 and @xmath13 intersects all the regular supporting hyperplanes of @xmath1 .",

    "since @xmath1 and @xmath4 are similar , they have the same finite number of sides , and so every regular supporting hyperplane of @xmath1 is such a @xmath20 . letting @xmath21 denote the fixed point of @xmath18",

    "the proof of theorem [ coll ] is the subject of section [ s.bounded ] .",
    "the first hole in the above ` proof idea ' when applied to general bounded sets is showing that they must be convex .",
    "the second ( more annoying ) snag is that when the number of regular supporting hyperplanes is not finite , it does not seem straightforward to argue that all regular supporting hyperplanes of @xmath1 must be parallel to regular supporting hyperplanes of @xmath4 ( in fact , we carry out the complete proof of theorem [ coll ] without showing this to be the case , though it is an immediate consequence of the theorem ) .",
    "this difficulty arises because of the prospect of similarity under nonhomothetic transformations ( _ i.e. _ , transformations that include nontrivial rotations ) . though it may seem intuitively natural that sets which are resilient must be so under homothetic transformations , we will see in section [ s.nonconvex ] that , without some assumptions like boundedness or convexity , there are in fact sets @xmath10 where @xmath17 , but only for transformations @xmath18 which include an irrational rotation .    as we will see in section [ s.nonconvex ] , unbounded resilient sets",
    "may be nonconvex and quite complicated geometrically , and unlikely to satisfy any simple geometric characterization like that given in theorem [ coll ] .",
    "nevertheless , we _ can _ prove a simple geometric characterization of ( possibly unbounded ) resilient sets which _ are _ convex ; this is the subject of theorems [ t.dcoll ] , [ t.inccoll ] , and [ t.isomcoll ] .",
    "resilient sets which are nonconvex behave in a counterintuitive way : eroding them makes them ` bigger ' , in that the corresponding similarity transformation is distance - increasing . to complete our characterization",
    ", we will see in section [ s.sic ] that a set is resilient to erosion in this distance - increasing way if and only if it is the erosion of a scale - invariant set ( one which is self - similar under non - isometric transformations ) , giving a surprising connection with ` exact fractals ' .",
    "there is another operation closely related to the erosion operation , which we call the _ expansion _ by a radius @xmath5 , defined as @xmath25",
    "again @xmath26 denotes an open ball , thus @xmath27 is always an open set .",
    "notice that we have @xmath28 , thus , in general , the erosion operation is equivalent to the expansion operation by taking complements .",
    "nevertheless , the family of _ convex _ expansion - resilient sets is much less rich than that of convex erosion - resilient sets .",
    "for example , it is not too hard to see that the only bounded expansion - resilient sets are open balls .",
    "we give the characterization of all convex expansion - resilient sets in section [ s.exp ] .",
    "we first show the ` if ' direction of theorem [ coll ] : as noted above , a convex body @xmath1 containing a ball @xmath13 of radius @xmath29 intersecting its regular supporting hyperplanes is determined up to similarity by the selection of the positions of the points on the ball where these intersections occur .",
    "the important point is that , up to the scaling of the ball , these positions are unchanged by the erosion operation .    to make this precise ,",
    "observe that the erosion @xmath4 of @xmath1 by a radius @xmath30 contains the ball @xmath31 of radius @xmath32 .",
    "also , note that @xmath4 is the intersection of the erosions @xmath33 of the regular supporting half - spaces @xmath19 of @xmath1 .",
    "the erosion @xmath33 by @xmath5 of any supporting half - space @xmath19 of @xmath1 tangent to @xmath13 will be tangent to @xmath34 , and the position of the point where the boundary of @xmath35 intersects @xmath34 is the same as the point where the boundary of @xmath19 intersects @xmath13 , apart from the scaling of the ball , since the point where a half - space is tangent to a ball is determined by the orientation of the half - space .",
    "thus @xmath4 is the intersection of some half - spaces which are the images of the regular supporting half - spaces of @xmath1 under some fixed dilation , and so @xmath4 is similar to @xmath1 under that same dilation .    for the other direction",
    ", we will first work to show that if @xmath1 is resilient and bounded , then it must be convex .",
    "( this is not the case if we drop the unbounded requirement . ) to do this , it suffices to show that if a nonconvex set undergoes erosion , some distance associated with it increases ( making it impossible that it is similar to the original set under a distance - decreasing similarity transformation ) .",
    "the associated ` distance ' we use is the _ ball - convexity _ :",
    "the _ ball - convexity _ @xmath36 of a closed set @xmath10 is the supremum of radii @xmath29 for which the complement of @xmath1 is a union of open balls of radius @xmath29 .",
    "the ball - convexity of a set provides a kind of measure of its convexity : note that any convex body @xmath1 satisfies @xmath37 , since the complement of any convex body can be written as the union of open half - spaces , which can be in turn written as the unions of balls of arbitrarily large radii .",
    "what about the converse ?",
    "it is not true in general that a set with infinite ball - convexity is convex : for example , any closed set @xmath38 lying entirely on some line has infinite ball convexity , even though many such sets are not convex .",
    "this the only kind of counterexample , however :    a closed set @xmath10 which does not lie in any @xmath39-dimensional subspace is convex if and only if @xmath37 .",
    "[ o.bcc ]    as already pointed out , the ` only if ' direction is clear . for the other direction ,",
    "assume @xmath1 is not convex .",
    "so there are points @xmath40 such that the line segment @xmath41 includes a point @xmath42 not in @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath1 is closed , in fact there is a ball @xmath43 about the point @xmath42 which contains no points of @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath1 does nt lie entirely in some @xmath39-dimensional subspace , we can choose additional points @xmath44 so that the convex hull of all the points @xmath45 is an @xmath46-simplex .",
    "now choose a point @xmath21 from @xmath43 which lies inside the @xmath46-simplex ( but not in @xmath1 ) .",
    "let @xmath29 the maximum of the radii of the @xmath47 @xmath39-spheres determined by @xmath46-tuples from the set @xmath48 .",
    "then we have that @xmath49 , since a ball of radius @xmath50 can not include the point @xmath21 without including one of the points @xmath51 .",
    "( this situation for @xmath52 dimensions is shown in figure [ f.bc ] . ) in particular , @xmath53 , as desired .",
    "for the dimension @xmath52 ; the distance @xmath29 is a upper bound on the ball - convexity of @xmath1 ; balls of any larger radius can not include the point @xmath21 without also including points of @xmath1 .",
    "[ f.bc ] ]    armed with the concept of ball convexity , it easy to show :    let @xmath17 for some @xmath0 and some similarity transformation @xmath18",
    ". then @xmath1 must be convex , unless the transformation @xmath18 is distance - increasing .",
    "[ l.convex ]    since @xmath1 is resilient , it is closed and does not lie in any @xmath39-dimensional subspace .",
    "also , if @xmath36 is finite , then we have that @xmath54 .",
    "thus we are done by observation [ o.bcc ] , since for @xmath36 to be finite , @xmath18 would have to be distance - increasing .",
    "the similarity transformation corresponding to the erosion of a bounded resilient set is always distance - decreasing since , for example , the diameter decreases upon erosion .",
    "thus lemma [ l.convex ] implies that bounded resilient sets must be convex . since a convex set is the intersection of its supporting half - spaces ( and even of just its regular ones ) , we can therefore study the erosion operation by examining its effect supporting half - spaces / hyperplanes .    first note that the erosion of an intersection equals the intersection of the erosions : @xmath55 for any family of subsets @xmath56 ( this is easily deduced from line ( [ crx ] ) ) .",
    "since a convex set @xmath1 is the intersection of its supporting half - spaces , we have for any regular supporting half - space @xmath19 of @xmath1 that @xmath57 .",

    "the unique supporting hyperplane at @xmath12 of @xmath4 is a parallel to the unique supporting hyperplane of @xmath1 at @xmath58.[regtreg ]    theorem [ coll ] will imply that any bounded resilient set @xmath1 is in fact resilient to erosion by all radii @xmath5 for which @xmath4 has positive diameter .",
    "for the proof of the theorem , we want to at least know that a bounded resilient set can be eroded to an arbitrarily small copy of itself .",
    "first observe the following :    for any similarity transformation @xmath18 with scaling factor @xmath59 , we have @xmath60.[o.commutes ]    observation [ o.commutes ] captures the way in which the erosion of a resilient set is again resilient to erosion .",

    "note that sierpiski s triangle is the invariant set of an iterated function system with ratio list @xmath324 and so has similarity dimension @xmath325 .",
    "koch s curve is the invariant set of an iterated function system with ratio list @xmath326 , thus has similarity dimension @xmath327 .",
    "we are trying to show how to get scale - invariant sets from fractals generated by an iterated function system .",
    "of course , given _ any _ set @xmath1 and a similarity transformation @xmath18 , the set @xmath328 is a scale - invariant set . in general , however , @xmath329 may not seem very related to the original set @xmath1 ; it may very well turn out to be the whole space , for example .    in the case of the invariant set of an iterated function system where we let",
    "@xmath330 , say , we have that @xmath331 suggesting that @xmath332 will retain some of the appearance of the set @xmath320 .",
    "the problem is that , in general , @xmath320 and @xmath333 may overlap , thus we are not guaranteed that @xmath332 shares the ` structure ' of @xmath320 .",
    "open set condition _ ( osc ) on iterated function systems , introduced by moran @xcite , is a condition which controls the extent of this overlap : it requires that there is an open set @xmath74 with @xmath334 for all @xmath335 , and @xmath336 for @xmath337 .",
    "one important consequence of the open set condition is that the similarity dimension of the iterated function system must coincide with the hausdorff dimension of the corresponding invariant set ; in particular , this allows the dimension to be easily computed in many cases ( osc is satisfied for the well - known examples of mathematical fractals , such as sierpiski s triangle and the koch curve ) .",
    "a recent result of bandt , et al . ( corollary 2 in @xcite ) implies that if an iterated function system satisfies the osc , then there is an open set @xmath338 which intersects the invariant set @xmath320 nontrivially and is disjoint from @xmath339 ; thus the intersection @xmath340 will be identical to the intersection @xmath341 .",
    "thus osc ensures that @xmath320 and @xmath332 share the same small - scale structure , in a certain sense .",
    "the preceding remarks imply that any fractal coming from an iterated function system satisfying the open set condition gives rise to a scale - invariant set which retains the small - scale structure of the original fractal .",
    "figure [ f.ist ] shows a portion of the scale - invariant extension of sierpiski s triangle , and figure [ f.koch ] shows a portion of the scale - invariant extension of the koch curve .",
    "since as fractals these sets have empty interior , it is necessary to take complements before taking the erosion to get a nonempty resilient set .",
    "figure [ f.sr ] shows the resulting resilient set produced from sierpiski s triangle . in the case of the unbounded version of koch s curve ,",
    "the complement consists of two components , which are each scale - invariant and thus can separately give rise to scale - invariant sets .",
    "figure [ f.ckoch ] shows the resilient set produced by taking the erosion of one of these components .",
    "since the concepts of erosion , expansion , and similarity make sense in an arbitrary metric space , the question of resiliency could be studied in a wide range of settings .",
    "( note that our proof of theorem [ t.sic ] is actually valid in any complete metric space . )",
    "there is a natural line of inquiry in euclidean space suggested by theorem [ t.sic ] , however .",
    "since this theorem makes its characterization in terms of scale - invariant sets , it is natural to wonder about the ` behavior ' of such sets . in this case",
    ", a natural line of attack seems to be from the standpoint of their transformation groups .",

    "there are relevant scale - invariant sets like the thickened logarithmic spiral @xmath273 whose self - similarity groups really are not discrete .",
