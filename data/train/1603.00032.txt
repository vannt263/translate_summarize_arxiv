    "ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) are a new type of galaxy discovered just over 15 years ago in spectroscopic surveys of the fornax galaxy cluster with sizes ( @xmath5 pc ) and luminosities ( @xmath6 ) intermediate between globular clusters ( gcs ) and dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "follow - up high resolution spectroscopy has found that ucds have similar internal velocity dispersions to dwarf elliptical nuclei ( @xmath730 km s@xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "initially labelled ucds @xcite or dwarf - globular transition objects @xcite their formation mechanism is still under debate , however two main scenarios have been suggested : they may be the high - mass end of the gc mass function observed around galaxies with rich gc systems @xcite or the nuclei of tidally stripped dwarf galaxies @xcite .    through dedicated surveys",
    "many new ucds have been found @xcite , to the point where the confirmed objects now number in the hundreds in the fornax cluster alone @xcite .",
    "ucds have since been discovered in many environments , including other galaxy clusters ( abell 1689 : @xcite ; virgo : @xcite ; centaurus : @xcite ; coma : @xcite ; hydra i : @xcite ; perseus : @xcite ) , galaxy groups ( dorado and ngc 1400 : @xcite ; ngc 5128 : @xcite ; hcg 22 and hcg 90 : @xcite ; ngc 3923 : @xcite ) and around isolated galaxies ( ngc 7252 : @xcite ; sombrero : @xcite ; ngc4546 : @xcite ) . as more ucds",
    "are found there is growing evidence that no single formation mechanism is responsible for their formation , however most ucds either formed as giant gcs or by tidal stripping of nucleated dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "although the formation mechanism of a few peculiar objects can be determined ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , disentangling the individual formation mechanism of most ucds is almost impossible due to the similar predictions of internal ucd properties from each formation scenario .",
    "determining the origin of ucds therefore requires detailed predictions of how much each possible formation mechanism contributes to ucd populations .",
    "tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies is a likely origin for many ucds ( and a confirmed origin for two objects , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) however their contribution to the total ucd population is uncertain ( and partly compounded by the various definitions of ucds ) .",
    "previous studies have shown that tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies can produce objects with similar properties to observed ucds @xcite .",
    "a number of studies presented estimates for the number of ucds formed due to tidal disruption @xcite . however",
    "as these estimates were based on ucd formation in clusters with static potentials they suffer from a number of problems .",
    "static models do not take into account ucd formation that may have occurred within subclusters that later fell into the main cluster .",
    "since galaxy clusters are expected to undergo many mergers during their formation , galaxies in clusters may be on chaotic orbits providing a few close pericentre passages necessary for ucd formation but far from the cluster centre at other times @xcite .",
    "galaxies orbiting in clusters may also have interactions with other satellite galaxies thereby making tidal disruption more likely .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p14 ) we presented the first model for ucd formation based on cosmological simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "our model uses a semi - analytic galaxy formation model to select possible ucd progenitor galaxies and to determine when they become disrupted by tidal forces .",
    "assuming that galaxies at high redshift have the same distribution of nucleus - to - galaxy mass and nucleation fraction as galaxies in the present day universe we determined the numbers and masses of ucds formed by tidal stripping .",
    "some preliminary analysis was presented comparing the number of ucds predicted with the observed number in the fornax cluster , finding at most @xmath310 per cent of ucds have formed by tidal stripping .    in this paper",
    "we compare in detail the predictions of the model with the properties of ucds from the fornax and virgo clusters .",
    "in particular we compare the predicted mass functions , radial and velocity distributions , metallicities and central black hole masses with the observed distributions . throughout the paper",
    "we refer to objects formed in the simulation by tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies as stripped nuclei since such objects may resemble both gcs and ucds and because the observed ucd populations may be the result of more than one formation channel .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : sam ] describes the criteria for selecting analogue galaxy clusters of the fornax and virgo clusters and briefly summarises the method of for identifying stripped nuclei in cosmological simulations .",
    "section [ sec : observations ] describes the compilation of observational data of gcs , ucds and dwarf galaxies .",
    "section [ sec : results ] presents the results comparing the simulation and observational data . in section [ sec : discussion ] and",
    "[ sec : summary ] we discuss the implications of our work for ucd formation scenarios and summarize our results .",
    "here we summarize the stripped nucleus formation model of and detail our selection criteria for comparing against observed galaxy clusters .",
    "the model makes use of the semi - analytic galaxy formation model ( sam ) of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g11 ) which was applied to the subhalo merger trees of the millennium - ii simulation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ms - ii ) .",
    "the ms - ii is a cosmological dark - matter only simulation which has a box size of 137 mpc and a particle mass of @xmath9 .",
    "the sam is constrained by low - redshift galaxy abundance and clustering in the sloan digital sky survey and is tuned to reproduce the @xmath10 mass distribution of galaxies down to stellar masses of @xmath11 . in the sam satellite galaxies (",
    "i.e. those currently or previously at the centre of non - dominant haloes orbiting within a more massive halo ) may have either resolved or unresolved dark matter ( dm ) haloes under the assumption that the stellar component of a satellite galaxy is harder to disrupt than its halo .",
    "for the stellar component of a satellite galaxy to be disrupted its dm halo must first be entirely dissolved ( i.e. become unresolved ) . since tidal stripping is not taken into account in the model , satellite galaxies do not lose stellar mass until they are completely disrupted .",
    "for all data associated with ms - ii and the sam we assume a cosmology consistent with the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ 1-year data ( wmap1 ) results @xcite and assume @xmath12 for all masses and distances .",
    "the data associated with the ms - ii and sam are publicly provided by the virgo - millennium database @xcite .    in a sample of galaxy clusters",

    "we limit the cluster sample according to the mass of the cluster we are comparing with . for the fornax cluster",

    "we choose all clusters within the range @xmath15@xmath16 @xcite , giving 13 clusters for comparison .",
    "after the sam clusters are chosen , stripped nuclei are identified in the simulations in the following way :    1 .",
    "the galaxy merger trees of all galaxies in the sam clusters at @xmath10 are searched for possible stripped nucleus progenitors ( hereafter referred to as candidate galaxies and the dm halo of the galaxies as candidate haloes ) .",
    "a galaxy is defined as a possible progenitor when the stellar mass exceeds @xmath11",
    "( i.e. all progenitors of the candidate galaxy have a stellar mass less than this limit ) .",
    "this lower mass cut is chosen based on the lower mass limit observed for nucleated galaxies .",
    "2 .   to form a stripped nucleus",
    "the candidate galaxy must undergo a merger with a more massive galaxy and the stellar component of the galaxy be completely disrupted according to the criteria in the sam ( equation 30 of ) .",
    "it is assumed that during this process the nuclear cluster of the galaxy is not disrupted since it is much more compact than the galaxy @xcite .",
    "3 .   the galaxy merger must be a minor merger , where a minor merger is defined as those with ` dynamical ' mass ratios smaller than 1:3 .",
    "the dynamical mass @xmath17 is defined as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the stellar mass of the galaxy , @xmath20 is the cold gas mass and @xmath21 is the mass of the dm halo within the nfw scale radius .",
    "4 .   the candidate galaxy merged ( i.e. the stellar component of the galaxy was disrupted according to the sam ) at least 2 gyr ago so there is enough time to form a ucd @xcite .",
    "the dynamical friction time of the stripped nucleus @xmath22 ( determined using equation 7 - 26 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is calculated at the snapshot before the candidate galaxy is disrupted . after a time @xmath22 the stripped nucleus",
    "is assumed to merge with the centre of the galaxy it is orbiting and therefore be completely disrupted .",
    "this differs from the treatment of dynamical friction in where the dynamical friction time was calculated for the halo the stripped nucleus is associated with at @xmath10 .",
    "we find the predictions of the model are unaffected by this change .",
    "after the candidate galaxy is disrupted the stripped nucleus takes the position and velocity of the most bound particle of the candidate halo ( similar to galaxies without resolved haloes in the sam ) .",
    "we also take into account orbital decay of the stripped nuclei due to dynamical friction by modifying the distance of the stripped nuclei from their host galaxies by a factor @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the time since the progenitor galaxy was disrupted ( this is identical to the treatment of satellite galaxies in the sam ) .",
    "the velocity of the stripped nucleus relative to the host galaxy was kept the same as the velocity of the most bound particle relative to the host halo ( to account for galaxies undergoing orbital decay in the sam ) .",
    "the two main assumptions for assigning physical properties to the stripped nuclei are the following :    1 .",
    "the stripped nucleus is assigned a mass randomly chosen from a log - normal mass function for the nucleus - to - galaxy mass ratio @xmath25 ( where the mass of the candidate galaxy is taken immediately before disruption ) . based on figure 14 from @xcite ,",
    "we choose a mean of 0.3 per cent and a log - normal standard deviation of 0.5 dex .",
    "tidal stripping of the stripped nuclei is not taken into account .",
    "recently , @xcite found @xmath26 per cent in both early- and late - type galaxies , lower than the value we assumed . therefore when comparing mass functions in section [ sec : massfunction ] we also consider this value for the nucleus - to - galaxy mass ratio .",
    "the fraction of galaxies that are nucleated is taken from observations of galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "for galaxies between stellar masses of @xmath27 and @xmath28 we choose a nucleation fraction that varies linearly ( in log - space ) between 0 and 80 per cent .",
    "between stellar masses of @xmath29 and @xmath30 we take an average nucleation fraction of 80 per cent . for galaxies above stellar masses of @xmath30",
    "we assume nuclear clusters are destroyed by supermassive black holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . where possible , to improve our statistics we work with fractions of stripped nuclei instead of randomly choosing galaxies to satisfy the nucleated fraction .",

    "many ucds have dynamical mass - to - light ( @xmath38 ) ratios above what can be explained by stellar population models @xcite .",

    "complete , spectroscopically confirmed samples of gcs and ucds to larger clustercentric radii would enable better comparisons .",
    "studies of different galaxy clusters have used different criteria to differentiate between gcs and ucds ; interpreting these results is difficult as different methods may obtain different results within the same cluster .",
    "future work should investigate each galaxy cluster using consistent methods to enable comparison between clusters .",
    "comparisons between observed and model ucd populations should be extended beyond the central galaxy of a galaxy cluster .",
    "programs like the ngvs @xcite combined with further spectroscopic surveys will enable a systematic comparison over the main subclusters of a galaxy cluster .",
    "observational constraints on the smbh occupation fraction in nucleated dwarf galaxies can be used to determine what fraction of stripped nuclei ( and thus ucds ) should have elevated dynamical mass - to - light ratios due to the presence of central black holes and , together with more observations of ucd dynamical mass - to - light ratios , determine if central black holes alone are sufficient to explain ucds with elevated mass - to - light ratios .",
    "on the simulation side a number of further refinements of our model are needed .",
    "too many high - mass stripped nuclei are predicted for the virgo cluster ( this may also be the case for the fornax cluster , however the number of objects is very small ) .",
    "a number of possible explanations exist for this difference :    1 .",
    "the galaxy disruption criterion in the sam is unrealistic .",
    "according to the sam , galaxies are disrupted when the density of a satellite galaxy within its half - mass radius is less than the host halo density at pericentre .",
    "this might overestimate the disruption of the highest mass stripped nuclei progenitor galaxies ( @xmath167-@xmath30 ) since such objects would need to lose more than 99 per cent of their mass to become ucds .",
    "2 .   related to the previous point",
    ", the high - mass stripped nuclei might not be observed as ucds but instead as compact ellipticals .",
    "if disruption of the progenitor galaxy is incomplete ( which is especially important for the highest mass progenitor galaxies that may require extremely small pericentre passages to completely remove the galaxy ) the resulting object may have a size larger than 100 pc and should be considered a compact elliptical rather than a ucd .",
    "our assumption that nuclei have a constant fraction of galaxy mass at all redshifts may not be realistic .",
    "future stripped nucleus formation models should include more realistic models for galaxy disruption , circularization of orbits by dynamical friction , continuous tidal stripping of the stripped nuclei and the effect of major galaxy mergers on stripped nuclei orbits . as the build up of nuclear clusters with redshift is not possible to observe ,",
    "models of nucleus formation are needed to include physically motivated nuclear cluster formation .",
    "size predictions are also needed to allow for better comparisons , in particular with virgo cluster ucds , and to determine if the most massive stripped nuclei predicted should be included in comparisons against ucds .",
    "these changes may affect the predictions for mass function , velocity dispersions and radial distributions .",
    "in this paper we compared in detail the predictions of the semi - analytic model for stripped nucleus formation presented in with the observed properties of ucds in the local universe .",
    "our main findings are as follows .    1 .",
    "the number of stripped nuclei predicted at the high - mass end of the mass function in fornax - like clusters is consistent with the most massive objects observed . for masses larger than @xmath84",
    "we predict stripped nuclei account for @xmath340 per cent of gcs@xmath0ucds and for masses between @xmath83 and @xmath84 account for @xmath32.5 per cent of gcs@xmath0ucds . for the virgo cluster more high - mass stripped nuclei",
    "are predicted than the number of observed ucds above masses @xmath3@xmath168 .",
    "below masses of @xmath3@xmath169 more virgo ucds ( defined as having @xmath94 pc ) are observed than the predicted number of stripped nuclei .",
    "2 .   the excess number of fornax gcs@xmath0ucds above the gc luminosity function agrees very well with the predicted number of stripped nuclei .",
    "therefore the gc@xmath0ucd mass function is consistent with being a combination of stripped nuclei and genuine gcs ( formed through the same process as the majority of gcs ) .",
    "this suggests the most massive genuine gc in the fornax cluster has a mass of @xmath3@xmath148 .",
    "3 .   the predicted velocity dispersions for stripped nuclei in fornax - sized clusters agrees well with the observed gc@xmath0ucd population at projected distances less than 100 kpc .",
    "for the virgo cluster the velocity dispersions of stripped nuclei agree reasonably well with gcs and ucds at distances less than @xmath350 kpc . at larger distances",
    "the velocity dispersions of stripped nuclei increase to that of the dwarf galaxies due to the increasing contribution of stripped nuclei accreted satellite galaxies .",
    "for both the fornax and virgo clusters the velocity dispersions of dwarf galaxies in the sam agree well with observed dwarf galaxies .",
    "stripped nuclei are predicted to have radially biased anisotropies that are approximately constant with radius ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "this agrees with virgo ucds at distances larger than 100 kpc but disagrees at smaller distances where ucds have @xmath162 decreasing to @xmath170 at distances less than 10 kpc @xcite .",
    "however , ongoing disruption is not included in our model which would cause orbits to become tangentially biased at small radii .",
    "5 .   for fornax - sized clusters the radial distribution of stripped",
    "nuclei agrees well with observed gcs@xmath0ucds within 83 kpc for masses @xmath1@xmath171 . within 300 kpc and for masses @xmath1@xmath84 stripped nuclei",
    "are on average more extended than observed gcs@xmath0ucds , but consistent due to the large scatter for the simulations .",
    "for virgo - sized clusters the radial distribution of stripped nuclei is significantly more extended than that of ucds .",
    "6 .   for masses between @xmath172 and @xmath173",
    ", the predicted metallicities of stripped nuclei agree well with the observed metallicities of gcs and ucds .",
    "below masses of @xmath174 , stripped nuclei are predicted to be @xmath30.5 dex more metal - rich on average than observed gcs and ucds .",
    "this may be due to a metallicity offset between nuclear clusters and host galaxies that scales with galaxy mass .",
    "the predicted central black hole masses for stripped nuclei agree well with the observed black hole mass of m60-ucd1 and the black hole masses implied for ucds assuming their elevated mass - to - light ratios are due to central black holes .",
    "however , assuming milky way gcs with possible central black holes formed as stripped nuclei , the predictions from the modelling are 10 - 100 time higher than the observed values , suggesting the modelling is inaccurate at these masses or that mw gcs with imbh estimates are not stripped nuclei .",
    "ucd black hole masses may therefore provide another approach to test smbh formation scenarios .",
    "these findings together suggest that , although not the dominant mechanism of ucd formation , a significant fraction of the highest mass ucds ( @xmath175 ) were formed by tidal stripping of nucleated galaxies .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for helpful comments and hong - xin zhang for providing us with data for virgo cluster gcs and ucds .",
    "hb is supported by the discovery project grant dp110102608 .",
