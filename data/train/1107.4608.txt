    "the ps .  ( ps1 ) survey @xcite represents the first of a new generation of multi - epoch digital sky surveys . in an effort to identify nearby t  dwarfs and rare ultracool dwarfs of interest , we are conducting a proper motion search that combines the first epoch of ps1 data with 2mass , with initial results from ps1 commissioning data in @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we present the discovery of a very high proper motion late - t  dwarf ,  ( hereinafter ) .",
    "this object has independently been identified by in a search for bright , very red objects in the _ wise _  preliminary data release with proper motions of @xmath90.3/year .",
    "they estimated a spectral type of t8t10 based on the @xmath2 color , a photometric distance of 5.5@xmath10  pc , and possible thick disk membership .",
    "our near - ir spectroscopy gives a spectral type of t8 , a photometric distance of @xmath4  pc , and probable thin disk membership .",
    "the  survey is obtaining multi - epoch imaging in 5  optical bands ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) with a 1.8-meter wide - field telescope on haleakala , maui .",
    "images are processed nightly through the image processing pipeline ( ipp ; @xcite ) .",
    "photometry is on the ab magnitude scale , and the first generation of astrometry is tied to 2mass , with limiting uncertainties of @xmath070  mas .",
    "although the ps1 filter system @xcite is very similar to sdss @xcite , there are differences .",
    "most notable are the facts that the @xmath14  filter is cut off at 840  nm unlike the long - pass @xmath16 filter , and sdss has no corresponding @xmath15  band ( @xmath17  nm , @xmath18  nm ) , which exploits the excellent red sensitivity of the ps1 detectors .",
    "we use data from the @xmath1  survey , the most time - intensive of the several ps1 surveys .",
    "this survey covers the 3@xmath19 steradians north of declination @xmath2030 , with each filter observed for a total of 6  epochs over 3  years , and with two exposures at each epoch spaced @xmath830  min apart to identify solar system objects .",
    "we used the the ipp software known as dvo ( desktop virtual observatory ; @xcite ) for managing the large numbers of ps1 detections and enabling large - area cross - correlations ( @xmath810@xmath21  objects ) .",
    "we ingested 2mass into the dvo database to mine the two datasets . at the time we did this ( february 2011 )",
    ", ps1 had not yet completed its first sweep of the sky . since the filters for the @xmath1  survey",
    "are observed weeks to months apart to optimize sky brightness conditions and parallax factors , we maximized our search area by focusing on the @xmath15  data alone , rather than employing multi - color criteria covering a smaller patchwork on the sky .",
    "our search method is described in detail by @xcite . in brief , we identified proper motion candidates by matching ps1 @xmath15  detections with 2mass @xmath22 band detections , excluding galactic latitudes of @xmath23 and allowing ps1 - 2mass separations of @xmath2428 .",
    "the ps1 data were taken from june  2009 to january  2011 , during commissioning and the first year of operations ; as 2mass was in operation from 19972001 , our search has a mean time baseline of 11  years , leading to a maximum proper motion of @xmath02.7/yr .",
    "we used generous ps1 - 2mass color cuts to remove m  dwarfs and some instrumental artifacts .",
    "false associations , whereby matches between ps1 and 2mass detections in fact are two distinct stationary objects , were then screened using usno - b @xcite and supercosmos @xcite , to depths of @xmath25 and @xmath26  mag .",
    "( a separate check of objects with counterparts found no strong t  dwarf candidates . )",
    "our search reaches magnitudes of @xmath27  mag and @xmath28  mag , with 2mass setting the search depth for t  dwarfs ( e.g. , figure  10 of @xcite ) .",
    "given our limiting magnitudes , our culling process is inevitably incomplete .",
    "indeed , the number of candidates increases at larger proper motions as expected due to the remaining mispairs .",
    "our core ps1 + 2mass search program focuses on objects with @xmath290.8/year , where the false alarm rate is tractable . however , the release of the _ wise _  preliminary data release @xcite in may  2011 opened the door to mining higher proper motions , by adding unique color information and an epoch of astrometry from the first half of 2010 .",
    "we cross - matched our 21,070 high proper motion candidates against the _ wise _  data at the ps1 position and excluded objects with a _ wise _  source at the 2mass position , returning 8,140 matches .",
    "for the 131  objects with @xmath30  mag , corresponding to spectral type t0 and later , we screened the sample visually to excise image artifacts ( using data from all the input surveys ) and remaining faint mispairs ( using the dss @xmath31-band images , as bright early - t  dwarfs might have counterparts on the @xmath32-band plates ) .",
    "for the remaining 58  objects , the separations between the ps1 and _ wise_positions showed the expected bimodal distribution of small separations ( true matches ) and large separations ( false matches ) , with a minimum around 4 .",
    "thus , we required the two positions to agree within 4 , leaving 49  objects .",
    "the final sample is illustrated in figure  [ fig : selection ] .",
    "two objects stand out as being very red in @xmath2 and having high proper motions .",
    "( objects with proper motions of @xmath330.5/yr will be discussed in a future paper . )",
    "one is the t7.5 dwarf gj  570d @xcite . the other , ( ) , was previously unknown at the time .",
    "we identified a @xmath16-only counterpart in the latest sdss data release ( dr8 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this object s absence in earlier releases explains why it was not found in past sdss searches .",
    "similarly , its faint @xmath22 band magnitude excluded it from previous 2mass searches .    at the time of our search , about 8200  sq .",
    "degs had @xmath15  data and were in the _ wise _  preliminary data release , with about 7800  sq .",
    "degs of the area also having @xmath14  data .",
    "( this includes the 74% fill factor for individual ps1 exposures due to gaps between ccds , masked pixels around bright stars , and bad regions of the detectors . ) to check our completeness , we examined the known t  dwarfs from dwarfarchives . out of the 16 objects that are present in _ wise",
    "_ , bright enough to be in 2mass , and residing within the area imaged by ps-1 , we retrieved 12 of them , with the rest being culled during the filtering process described above , e.g. , by being too close to a usno - b source .",
    "thus our estimated completeness is 75% .",
    "the other high proper motion object found by , the t9t10  dwarf wisep  j1741 + 2533 , was not selected as its sky position did not have @xmath15  imaging when we did our data - mining .",
    "we obtained low - resolution ( @xmath34100 ) spectra of  on 2011  june  25 and july  21  ut from nasa s infrared telescope facility located on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the two spectra agree well , but the july one had higher s / n so we use it here .",
    "conditions were photometric with average seeing .",
    "we used the near - ir spectrograph spex @xcite in prism mode with the 0.8  slit , obtaining 0.82.5  spectra in a single order .",
    "the total on - source integration time was 16  min .",
    "we observed the a0v star hd  18571 contemporaneously with  for telluric calibration .",
    "all spectra were reduced using version  3.4 of the spextool software package @xcite .",
    "the spectrum shows the strong  and  absorption characteristic of late - t  dwarfs ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "we classified  using the five spectral indices from @xcite , with spectral types assigned using the polynomial fits from @xcite . excluding the saturated -@xmath35 index ,",
    "the average spectral type from the indices was t8.0 with an rms of 0.14  subclasses .",
    "we also computed the @xmath36 and @xmath37-@xmath38 indices of @xcite and , respectively , and found values similar to known t8 dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , we visually classified  by comparing with spex prism spectra of late - t dwarf spectral standards .",
    "following the prescription of @xcite , the depth of the and  absorption bands were examined , normalizing the spectra of  and the standards at their @xmath22 , @xmath38 , and @xmath35-band peaks .",
    "the agreement with the t8  standard 2mass  j0415@xmath200935 is excellent , with  showing stronger absorption than the t7.5  dwarf gj  570d .",
    "the t8.5 objects from and @xcite have deeper  absorption and narrower @xmath22  and @xmath38  band continuua than .",
    "thus , the indices and visual typing both give a spectral type of t8 .",
    "we fit the solar metallicity bt - settl-2010 model atmospheres @xcite to our spectrum .",
    "the models span @xmath39  k ( @xmath40  k ) and @xmath41 ( cgs ; @xmath42 ) .",
    "we first flux - calibrated our spectrum to the weighted average of the 2mass @xmath22  and @xmath38  band photometry ( which is only s / n  @xmath0  56 in each filter ) . following @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we used a monte carlo approach to fit the 0.82.4  data , excluding the 1.601.65  region because of the known incompleteness of the methane line list . for each monte carlo trial",
    ", we changed the flux calibration and spectrum assuming normal distributions for the photometric and spectroscopic uncertainties , respectively .",
    "we then fit the model atmospheres to each artificial spectrum and repeated the process 10@xmath43 times .",
    "the best - fitting model has @xmath44  k and @xmath45 ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) , comparable to atmosphere fitting results for other comparably late - type objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the broad - band photometry agrees well with the model , except for @xmath46 where the model is a factor of @xmath47 fainter .",
    "the mid - ir colors of late - t dwarfs show significant scatter with spectral type ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) , due to non - equilibrium co/  chemistry , metallicity , and surface gravity effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are not fully incorporated into current models .",
    "this empirical scatter also explains the spectral type of t8t10 inferred by based on the mid - ir colors , compared to the actual type of t8 .",
    "based on an unweighted fit to 19  objects from l5t10 with parallaxes and _ wise _  data , we derive a 3rd - order polynomial for the @xmath46 band absolute magnitude @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50=15 for l5 , = 20 for t0 , etc .",
    "the rms scatter about the fit is only 0.18  mag .",
    "this gives a photometric distance of @xmath4  pc .",
    "pc where @xmath31 is the object s radius .",
    "the lyon / cond evolutionary models predict a radius of 0.100.08  for an effective temperature of 800  k and ages of 110  gyr , resulting in a spectroscopic distance of 1012  pc .",
    "@xcite show that such distances for late - t  dwarfs range from @xmath012@xmath51 the parallactic distance . ]",
    "the 2.56/yr proper motion of  is exceptional . among field",
    "t  dwarfs , the only object with a larger value is the t7.5  dwarf 2mass  j1114@xmath2026 ( 3.05/yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which @xcite characterize as slightly metal - poor ( @xmath52\\approx-0.3 $ ]  dex ) .",
    "our photometric distance of @xmath4  pc leads to a tangential velocity of @xmath5  .",
    "following @xcite , we assess the galactic membership of  using an oversampled simulation of the stars within 30  pc from the besanon model .",
    "the model provides  distributions for thin disk , thick disk , and halo stars .",
    "we compute the membership probabilities for  from the fraction of its nearest neighbors that belong to each model population . for  =  87",
    ", we find membership probabilities in the thin / thick disk of 0.87/0.13 , with @xmath330.01 probability of belonging to the halo .",
    "thus , even though the  of  is large , it is merely on the cusp of thin / thick disk membership , because of the many more thin disk stars ( a divide of 0.973/0.026/0.002 between thin disk / thick disk / halo members in this model ) .",
    "thin disk membership is preferred , even accounting for the measurement uncertainty ; at the @xmath531@xmath54 limits of  ( 79 and 95  ) , the thin / thick disk probabilities are 0.90/0.10 and 0.77/0.23 , respectively.100  t  dwarfs with proper motion measurements , only three objects have 2mass  j1114@xmath2026 ( t7.5 , @xmath55  ; @xcite ) , ulas  j1319 + 1209 ( t5 , @xmath56  ; @xcite ) , and ulas  j0926 + 0835 ( t4 , @xmath57  ; @xcite ) .",
    "murray et al .",
    "suggest their two ulas objects are likely halo objects , based on their kinematics relative to the galactic disk velocity ellipsoid .",
    "our approach finds thick disk membership seems plausible . at the @xmath531@xmath54 limits on ,",
    "ulas  j1319 + 1209 has probabilities of 0.09/0.81/0.10 and 0.00/0.29/0.71 for thin disk / thick disk / halo membership , and ulas  j0926 + 0835 has 0.07/0.82/0.11 and 0.00/0.15/0.85 .",
    "likewise , for 2mass  j1114@xmath2026 , we find probabilities of 0.36/0.63/0.01 and 0.02/0.83/0.15 , again suggesting thick disk membership . ]",
    "the near - ir spectrum indicates a metallicity comparable to other field objects ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "is very similar to the t8  dwarf 2mass  j0415@xmath2009 , which is inferred to have [ fe / h ]  =  0.00.3 and @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "a solar metallicity is also signalled by the @xmath59  band continuum shape , which is metallicity - sensitive @xcite .",
    "shows a more pointed shape than the t7.5  dwarf 2mass  j1114@xmath2026 , which is inferred to be sub - solar ( [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath200.3 ; @xcite ) . finally , the weaker @xmath35  band flux of  compared to the t8  dwarf ross  458c further indicates that  has a metallicity and surface gravity ( age ) typical of field objects .",
    "the youth ( 150800  myr ) and metal - richness ( [ fe / h ]  =  + 0.20.3 ) of ross  458c reduce the effect of collision - induced  opacity , leading to brighter @xmath35  band emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our model atmosphere fitting gives a low surface gravity ( = 4.0 ) ; however , the result is ill - constrained , as seen by the @xmath60  surface ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , a better constraint comes from comparing  to other late - t dwarfs using the @xmath36 and @xmath61 indices , guided by model atmosphere predictions and empirical benchmarks .",
    "in such a representation ( e.g. , figure  5 of @xcite ) ,  is inferred to have a relatively high surface gravity ( @xmath62 ) based on its large @xmath61 value , consistent with an old ( @xmath9gyr ) age .",
    "ps1 @xmath1  survey  @xmath14  and @xmath15  imaging are scheduled to maximize the parallax factor between epochs , with the goal of deriving parallaxes over the entire survey .",
    "given the proxmity of , a preliminary result is possible even with only a 5-month ps1 baseline ( 3 epochs from 2010.65 to 2011.06 , with 2 exposures per epoch ) , by adding astrometry from 2mass ( 2000.73 ) , sdss ( 2008.72 ) , and _ wise _  ( 2010.08 ) .",
    "altogether , these data span a 10-year baseline . for _",
    "wise _ , there are known @xmath80@xmath635 systematic errors in the preliminary release source catalog , so we constructed our own astrometric catalog for 1  sq .",
    "deg around  from the preliminary single exposure ( l1b ) working database , which we found to be unaffected by such problems .",
    "we cross - matched individual _ wise _  detections and used the weighted average and standard error for positions and uncertainties . for 2mass and sdss , we assumed relative positional uncertainties of 100  mas and 70  mas , respectively , based on our experience with matching these catalogs to high - precision ( @xmath64  mas ) relative astrometry from our parallax program on the canada - france - hawaii telescope @xcite .",
    "we then combined all nine astrometric datapoints ( 2mass , sdss , _ wise _ , and 6  @xmath51  ps1 ) , allowing for small shifts and a full linear transformation .",
    "we used a markov chain monte carlo method to determine the posterior distributions of the proper motion and parallax .",
    "the best solution had @xmath65 ( 13 degrees of freedom ) , validating our astrometric errors .",
    "a parallax of @xmath6  mas ( figure  [ fig : parallax ] ) , and a proper motion of @xmath66/yr and @xmath67 .",
    "this includes a ( negligible ) correction from relative to absolute parallax of @xmath68  mas computed using the besanon model as described in @xcite .",
    "for the median  of 30  of ultracool dwarfs within 20  pc @xcite , our proper motion range of 0.52.7/yr corresponds to distances of 12  pc and 2  pc .",
    "( objects with higher tangential velocities of course can be selected at even larger distances . )",
    "this approximate kinematic limit is well - matched to the @xmath69  mag limit for our search : the three t7.5  dwarfs with 2mass photometry and parallaxes have @xmath70  =  15.93 , 15.65 , and 16.47  mag ( hd  3651b , 2mass  j1217@xmath2003 , and gj  570d , respectively ) and the t8  dwarf 2mass  j0415@xmath2009 has @xmath71  mag , meaning our search has a limiting distance of @xmath012  pc for t8  dwarfs ( 9  pc for the 2mass full - sky completeness of @xmath72 ) .",
    "the limiting distance drops precipitously for later types : the t10  dwarf ugps  j0722@xmath2005 @xcite at 4  pc has @xmath73  mag , right at the nominal 2mass limit .",
    "the modest number of candidates from our search suggests that the immediate ( @xmath810  pc ) solar neighborhood does not contain a large reservoir of undiscovered t  dwarfs down to about t8 .",
    "we found 710  candidates ( depending on the cutoff used for the ps1-_wise_separation ) with proper motions of 0.52.7/year and colors of @xmath30 , including 3  previously known objects . in comparison ,",
    "dwarfarchives.org lists 30 objects in the same proper motion range and with spectral types of t0t8 ( ignoring 2 tight companions found by adaptive optics imaging ) .",
    "since our ps1 + 2mass+_wise _  search covered @xmath020% of the sky , a rough estimate based on the known census predicts we should identify about 6  objects , consistent with our findings .",
    "the pan - starrs1 surveys have been made possible by the institute for astronomy , the university of hawaii , the pan - starrs project office , the institutions of the pan - starrs1 science consortium ( http://www.ps1sc.org ) , and nasa .",
    "our research has employed the _ wise _ , sdss - iii , and 2mass data products ; nasa s astrophysical data system ; the simbad database ; the m , l , and t  dwarf compendium housed at dwarfarchives.org , and the spex prism spectral libraries .",
