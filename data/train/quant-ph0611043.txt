    "<S> we study analytic structure of the green s function ( gf ) for the exactly solvable fano - anderson model . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze the gf poles , branch points and riemann surface , and show how the fermi s golden rule , valid in perturbative regime for not to large time , appears in this context . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of analytic structure of the gf in frequency representation opens opportunities for obtaining formulas for the gf in time representation alternative to the standard one using the spectral density .    </S>",
    "<S> the fano - anderson model @xcite , which presents discrete level coupled to continuum is probably one of the simplest and best known in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> it is exactly solvable , and the solution of the model in terms of green s functions ( gf ) is presented in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral line intensity calculated in the paper by fano are conveniently represented using the green s function spectral density @xcite . when the problem is treated within the quantum mechanics proper </S>",
    "<S> , one is typically interested in the tunneling of the particle , initially localized at the discrete level into continuum ( see e.g. cohen - tannoudji et . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the non - tunneling amplitude is standardly expresses also through the green s function spectral density , so pragmatically speaking this is what we need . </S>",
    "<S> however , in this paper we would like to see the green s function in a broader context , and study its analytical structure as a function of frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we ll see that green s function ( in frequency representation ) is a multi valued function , and on simple examples study its branch points , poles and riemann surface . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we ll see that this study can be of practical value also , because it opens new opportunities to connect the frequency representation of the green s function ( used in calculation of the spectral line intensity ) with the time representation , necessary for the quantum mechanics proper .    to have everything at hand </S>",
    "<S> let us present a pedagogical derivation of the non - tunneling amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> our system consists of the continuum band , the states bearing index @xmath0 , and the discrete state @xmath1 , having energy @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the problem is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a band state and @xmath5 is the state localized at site @xmath1 ; h.c </S>",

    "<S> the wave - function can be presented as @xmath6 with the initial conditions @xmath7 , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the non - tunneling amplitude is just the appropriate gf in time representation . </S>",
    "<S> schroedinger equation for the model considered takes the form @xmath9    making fourier transformation ( i m @xmath10 ) @xmath11 we obtain @xmath12 for the amplitude to find electron at the discrete level , straightforward algebra gives @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 the integration in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ int ] ) is along any infinite straight line parallel to real axis in the upper half plane of the complex @xmath16 plane . </S>",

    "<S> the quantity @xmath18 is self - energy ( or mass operator ) .    for tunneling into continuum , the sum in eq . </S>",

    "<S> we would like to calculate integral ( [ int ] ) closing the integration contour by a semi - circle of an infinite radius in the lower half - plane . </S>",
    "<S> thus we need to continue analytically the function @xmath17 which was defined initially in the upper half plane ( excluding real axis ) to the whole complex plane . we can do it quite simply , by considering eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exact ] ) and ( [ sigma3 ] ) as defining propagator in the whole complex plane , save an interval of real axis between the points @xmath22 and @xmath21 , where eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigma3 ] ) is undetermined . </S>",
    "<S> ( propagator analytically continued in such a way we ll call the standard propagator . ) </S>",

    "<S> then for large @xmath35 @xmath38 the similar contribution comes from the top of the band .    if there can exist poles of the propagator ( [ exact ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we should add the residues to the integral ( [ cut ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus we obtain @xmath39 where the index @xmath40 enumerates all the real poles @xmath41 of the integrand , and @xmath42 notice , that the poles correspond to the energies of bound states which can possibly occur for @xmath43 or @xmath44 , and which are given by the equation @xmath45 if we take into account that normalized bound states are @xmath46^{1/2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the residue can be easily interpreted as the amplitude of the bound state in the initial state @xmath5 , times the evolution operator of the bound state times the amplitude of the state @xmath5 in the bound state @xmath47 if the propagator has one real pole at @xmath48 , from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ft ] ) we see that the survival probability @xmath49 when @xmath50 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ ft ] ) is the contribution from the continuous spectrum , and the second term is the contribution from the discrete states .    </S>",
    "<S> an indication that there is more in the gf than we have so far discussed comes from the following fact : we could have obtained the fgr in perturbative regime directly from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ int ] ) , changing exact green function ( [ exact ] ) to an approximate one , which may be called the fgr propagator @xmath53 thus approximated , propagator has a simple pole @xmath54 , and the residue gives eq . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ app ] ) and the fgr propagator have totally different singularities , and still give the same survival probability ( in finite time interval ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the explanation is that the gf is multi valued , and different sheets of the function can be used to calculate integral ( [ int ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these ideas can be easily understood for simple examples . </S>",
    "<S> consider a site coupled to a semi - infinite lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the system is described by the tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the state localized at the @xmath57-th site of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the band ( lattice ) states are described by the hamiltonian @xmath58 where @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> hence we regain hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) with @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> after simple algebra we obtain ( in the upper half plain ) @xmath61 where the square root is defined as having the phase @xmath62 just above the real axis between @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . </S>",

    "<S> the standard approach consists of making the cut along the straight line between the branch points and considering only one sheet , thus making the analytic continuation into the lower @xmath16 half - plain by continuing @xmath18 along the curves which circumvent the right branch point clockwise and the and the left branch point anti - clockwise on the other hand , we could use a different continuation , along the curve passing through the part of real axis between @xmath22 and @xmath21 . in this case , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fgrr ] ) which is valid in the perturbative regime near the point @xmath81 in the upper half - plane is valid in lower half - plain also , thus giving a pole in a different sheet of the multivalued propagator .    </S>",
    "<S> this pole becomes important if the analytical continuation of @xmath17 into the lower half - plain is done by making the cuts from the branch points to infinity and continuing the function between the cuts along the curves passing through the part of real axis between @xmath22 and @xmath21 , and outside as we did it previously . </S>",

    "<S> the second example is defined by the equation @xmath82 thus we get @xmath83 the riemann surface has an infinite number of sheets . </S>",
    "<S> the standard sheet is obtained by defining @xmath84 as having the phase @xmath85 just above the real axis between @xmath63 and @xmath64 . </S>",
