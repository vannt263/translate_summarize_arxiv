    "the distance to the galactic bulge has until recently kept the prospects of observing directly the chemical properties of its constituent stars just past the edge of possibility .",
    "even now , with large - aperture telescopes such as the kecks , the vlt , the het , and the gemini twins among others , only the brightest giants in the bulge have been observable  @xcite . a novel approach employed by the macho microlensing team",
    "has taken advantage of the temporary brightening of the source star during the lensing event to effectively decrease that once prohibitive distance to the galactic center and allow for the observation of less evolved stars .",
    "for example , minniti et al .",
    "@xcite first published results in 1997 on the presence of a li i feature observed in a hot ( @xmath0  k ) main sequence turn - off star . in this paper",
    "we discuss the full analysis of the that spectrum along with the spectra of five other stars observed during lensing events between 1997 and 1999 .",
    "the results to date are still preliminary ; however , they offer a glimpse into the diverse chemical evolution scenarios that can be found in and around the center of the milky way .",
    "future telescopes with effective apertures in the 30-m or more range will make such observations commonplace rather than rare .",
    "between august 1997 and july 1999 we observed with the keck i telescope and the hires echelle spectrometer 18 microlensing events that occurred when a small compact object ( e.g. , a normal star ) crossed the line of sight between earth and a bulge member , causing a temporary increase in the brightness of the latter by gravitational lensing .",
    "of these , only six spectra had a sufficiently high signal - to - noise ratio to undergo a complete analysis that allowed us to determine : 1 ) radial velocities ; 2 ) atmospheric parameters ; and 3 ) chemical abundances .",
    "these six stars are described in table  [ tab : stars ] , where they are identified by their lensing event number and their macho i d in the first two columns , their unlensed magnitude and color in the next two columns , the epoch of their observation and the exposure time in the fifth and sixth columns , and an estimate of the signal - to - noise ratio in the last column . the ( @xmath1 colors are corrected based on recent extinction maps by popowski , cook , and becker  @xcite .",
    "we note that the events 97-blg-45 and 97-blg-47 were indeed the same star identified separately in overlapping macho fields .",
    "the event 98-blg-6 was observed spectroscopically during two separate epochs in 1998 , with the spectra being combined after ensuring no variation in the relative quality of each set of observations .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of this event represents that of the combined ( 16,200 s ) spectra .",
    "information regarding these and other microlensing events can be found on the macho project home page at http://www.macho.mcmaster.ca/.

    "this allowed for the observation of many atomic absorption lines ; however , it missed the important [ o  i ] feature at @xmath56300 .",
    "we binned the data @xmath6 in order to increase signal and decrease readout times .",
    "combined with typical seeing of 1 , this produced a resolution of r  @xmath7  29,000 ; sufficient for doing abundances work .",
    "the data were reduced using the batch mode of makee , written by t.  barlow and modified by him to accommodate our @xmath6 binning format .",
    "makee takes raw images as input and , after correcting for bias and flat fielding , extracts and wavelength calibrates the spectra .",
    "we then converted the makee fits output files into an iraf readable format using the makee routine linear .",
    "once the spectra were extracted we used the spectrum of a rapidly rotating hot star to correct for telluric lines by dividing the object spectrum by that of the rapid rotator , with the two spectra scaled and shifted by hand in the iraf routine telluric .",
    "this removed most of the blaze function , allowing us to fit a low order polynomial to the data to produce flat , normalized spectra .",
    "we then measured the equivalent widths of lines by fitting gaussians with the iraf routine splot . to test the quality of the data reduction",
    ", we reduced the spectra of many comparison stars that were taken with our program stars and that have equivalent widths published in the literature ( e.g. , edvardsson et al .",
    "we found the agreement between our equivalent widths and the published data to be generally excellent , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ewcomp ] for a sample star .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     finally , we note that our radial velocity is 30 km  s@xmath8 lower than that listed in minniti et al .",
    "@xcite for uncertain reasons .",
    "given the excellent agreement we obtained between the radial velocities of our `` standards '' observed on the same nights as 97-blg-45/47 and their published values , we are quite confident in our determination listed in table  [ tab : params ] .",
    "microlensing has allowed us to derive a reasonably large and detailed set of abundances for a group of stars that have heretofore been beyond our capabilities .",
    "while some work on the details remains to be done before conclusions can be firmly drawn , we have been able to study abundance trends in stars as diverse as solar analogs and metal - poor red giants .",
    "our early results show a trend of overabundance in nearly all the elements regardless of metallicity or spectral class .",
    "the two giants in the study also have the lowest metallicities and the highest radial velocities , and they are easily ruled out as members of the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal .",
    "we have also re - analyzed the li abundance in the star 97-blg-45 and have found that we can not conclusively rule for or against the presence of li .",
    "all the spectra show some hint of li @xmath56708 and we will examine these in kind to determine abundances or upper limits .",
    "our results are likely to change for some of the elements where hfs or isotopic corrections are still necessary .",
    "when possible we corrected for hfs effects by correcting one line and applying a shift to the results from all the lines .",
    "sometimes the shift was large ( @xmath9 dex ) and sometimes it was nonexistent .    thanks to a helping hand from nature , we were able to get a glimpse at the functioning of keck as a much larger telescope than its current 10-m diameter .",
    "future 30-m and larger class telescopes will make such observations commonplace and allow us to learn truly the diverse histories of the galactic bulge stellar population .",
    "we wish to thank stefan keller for helping us classify our stars , piotr popowski for providing us with extinction maps of the macho fields , and tom barlow for modifying his makee routine to accept our data format and answering our many questions .",
