    "this prompts us to introduce a nonequilibrium generalisation of the linear response seebeck coefficient @xmath96 to the case of a nonzero current @xmath97 as @xmath98 we expect @xmath96 to be well accessible by experiments since it may be measured through a temporal modulation of @xmath4 at constant current . with @xmath96 and the knowledge of @xmath10 the thermoelectric response @xmath3 , which is the object of our further analysis , can be determined .    to evaluate @xmath3 we differentiate eq.([eq : current ] ) with respect to @xmath4 and find two contributions @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 in equilibrium , eq.([eq : djdt_a ] ) vanishes and eq.([eq : djdt_b ] )",

    "we finally note that in the present analysis we will focus on evaluating eq.([eq : djdt ] ) for cases with @xmath9 and @xmath42 .              in order to determine the nonequilibrium self - energy @xmath82 we here use the so - called auxiliary master equation approach ( amea ) , as previously introduced in refs .   and in its recent mps implementation ref .",
    "the basic principle of the approach is to map the original nonequilibrium ( or equilibrium ) impurity problem onto an auxiliary one , in which the bath is modeled by a small number @xmath109 of bath sites and additional markovian environments . by this",
    ", a finite open quantum system described by a lindblad equation is obtained , which can be solved accurately by numerical techniques .",
    "the mapping procedure relies on the condition to represent the original hybridization function as accurately as possible by the auxiliary one .",
    "a similar idea is commonly used in the context of dynamical mean field theory  @xcite . however , in order to be able to address nonequilibrium situations it is necessary to fit not only the retarded but also the keldysh component , and therefore to construct an auxiliary hybridization with a continuous spectrum . the amea approach is conveniently formulated in terms of keldysh green s functions  @xcite , and particularly suited to treat steady state situations .",
    "time - dependent problems are also accessible in principle , but go beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "amea provides an accurate approximation for the impurity self - energy @xmath82 , for details on the method we refer to ref .  .",
    "the accuracy is hereby controlled by the quality of the mapping procedure and can be systematically improved by increasing @xmath109 , the convergence being exponential in @xmath109  @xcite . in practice , of course , finite values for @xmath109 have to be chosen and with that techniques we are currently able to consider as many as @xmath110 . the calculations in ref",
    ".   demonstrated that these values allow for very accurate results .",

    "in our previous calculations in ref .",
    "we treated particle - hole symmetric situations only .",
    "however , this was done for convenience and is by no means a restriction of the method .",
    "the difference is that for @xmath112 two independent green s functions have to be computed in the many - body solution and that twice as many fit parameters must be considered in the mapping procedure .",
    "both aspects require increased computational resources , mainly due to the many - body calculation , but no essential conceptual modifications .",
    "the differential quantities @xmath3 are estimated by finite differences , see app.[sec : fit ] for more details on the implementation .",
    "we start by investigating the current response @xmath3 of the nonequilibrium siam to an infinitesimal temperature difference @xmath87 .",
    "we are interested , in particular , in the nonequilibrium behavior as a function of bias voltage @xmath6 .",
    "for all calculations we used an average temperature @xmath57 , which , for @xmath113 , corresponds to the point at which @xmath3 as function of @xmath5 has a maximum below @xmath0 .",
    "this is determined from an equilibrium nrg calculation , see inset of the third panel of fig.[fig : djdt_u6 ] .    in fig.[fig",
    ": djdt_vg1 ] we analyze the general behavior of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath6 as determined by eq.([eq : djdt ] ) together with its two contributions eqs.([eq : djdt_a ] ) and ( [ eq : djdt_b ] ) , for different values of @xmath22 at a gate voltage @xmath114 . in the noninteracting case ,",
    "a plateau up to @xmath115 precedes the decrease of @xmath3 as a function of @xmath6   as well , which showed that @xmath3 develops a peak at @xmath115 for @xmath116 . ] . in this case",
    "only the second term contributes since the lead density of states , and thus the noninteracting spectral function @xmath117 , is independent of @xmath6 and @xmath5 . as a consequence , according to eq.([eq : djdt_b ] ) , for @xmath118 we have that @xmath3 just measures the asymmetry of the equilibrium @xmath117 at @xmath119 .    for a finite value of @xmath120 in the kondo regime , the results change significantly .",
    "the current response @xmath3 is positive for all @xmath6 and decreases much faster as a function of @xmath6 , with a dependence that resembles the one of @xmath10 , see e.g. refs .  .",
    "however , in contrast to the conductance , in this case the relevant energy scale controlling the decrease can not be identified with @xmath0 . in particular , this does not depend on @xmath22 and appears to be proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "this agrees with the findings in ref .   and with the results below .",
    "we note the functional behavior of the two contributions and is very different , as shown in the second and third panel of fig.[fig : djdt_vg1 ] . while decreases with @xmath6 ( being maximal for @xmath7 ) and strongly depends on the interaction , in contrast , exhibits a similar behavior for all values of @xmath22 : starting from zero , increases with applied bias and saturates at @xmath121 . for @xmath50 the two contributions compensate each other yielding a nearly @xmath6-independent @xmath3 .",
    "+         in order to gain a more detailed understanding of this behavior we analyze the frequency dependence of the spectral function as well as of the integrand determining @xmath3 .",
    "the nonequilibrium spectral functions for @xmath42 , which determine the second contribution , are shown in the upper panels of fig.[fig : spectral_djdt_vg1 ] .",
    "we observe a pronounced kondo peak at @xmath7 for all values of @xmath22 .",
    "for the results depicted in fig.[fig : spectral_djdt_vg1 ] the temperature is fixed to @xmath57 and @xmath22 decreases from left to right .",
    "hence the ratio @xmath122 decreases from left to right , resulting in an increasing height of the kondo peak .",
    "moreover , it appears that for the smallest value of the interaction the peak is rather broad as it is not well separated from the lower hubbard band   is already in the transition to the mixed valence regime . ] as compared to larger @xmath22 .",
    "the low - energy details are less smeared out for @xmath123 for which a splitting of the kondo resonance into two peaks is clearly visible for sufficiently large @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast to the particle - hole symmetric case the splitting is asymmetric in presence of a finite gate voltage . this has important implications for the seebeck coefficient . at low temperatures ( and @xmath7 )",
    "its sommerfeld expansion reads @xmath124 ( see  ref .  ) .",
    "a large thermopower is thus obtained for a highly asymmetric @xmath117 with a large slope at the fermi energy @xmath125 and a small @xmath126 . in equilibrium , the spectral function is symmetric around the fermi level leading to a vanishingly small thermopower  @xcite ( note that an external magnetic field would yield a peak below and one above the fermi energy , but the total spin - averaged seebeck coefficient remains small  @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , in nonequilibrium the asymmetric splitting of @xmath117 for a finite gate voltage gives rise to an enhanced seebeck coefficient  @xcite .            in the lower panels of fig.[fig : spectral_djdt_vg1 ] we show the results for the response of the spectral function to an infinitesimal temperature difference , more specifically the integrand @xmath127 of eq.([eq : djdt_a ] ) which is proportional to @xmath128 ( evaluated numerically ) times the transport window @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath127 is maximal for @xmath130 and vanishes in the limit @xmath131 due to the narrowing transport window .",
    "the main characteristic features are a positive peak at @xmath132 and a negative one at @xmath133 , which appear in correspondence of the position of the leads chemical potentials and thus of the split kondo peaks .",
    "hence the kondo peaks strongly affect the response @xmath134 to a temperature difference . in the limit of large @xmath6 and @xmath22",
    "a simple picture emerges : the dominating effect of @xmath4 is that the split kondo peaks are asymmetrically enhanced or suppressed .",
    "this effect can be clearly seen for @xmath50 and @xmath135 , for instance , where @xmath127 exhibits only two peaks at @xmath136 and no response in the region in between .",
    "the sign of the two peaks is determined by the direction in which the temperature difference is applied .",
    "since we considered @xmath40 and @xmath41 , analogously to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , it is intuitive that the kondo peak at @xmath137 is enhanced and the one at @xmath138 is suppressed . for lower values of the interaction strength",
    "the behavior is more complex since the split kondo peaks are less pronounced and merge with the hubbard bands already for rather small values of @xmath6 : the two peaks at @xmath136 are reduced in favor of a larger weight around @xmath139 . in all cases , the overall sign when integrating @xmath127 is positive ( see also fig.[fig : djdt_vg1 ] ) , since for @xmath56 the kondo peak at @xmath137",
    "is enhanced by the proximity of the lower hubbard band .",
    "the nearly constant @xmath3 for @xmath140 ( and @xmath141 , i.e. in correspondence of split kondo peaks in fig.[fig : spectral_djdt_vg1 ] ) observed in fig.[fig : djdt_vg1 ] can be understood in the following way .",
    "since is dominated by the response at @xmath142 one may argue that the contribution form to the overall response flattens out for sufficiently large @xmath6 ( see second panel ) . on the other hand ,",
    "tends to zero around @xmath143 ( see third panel ) , which can be attributed to a reduced asymmetry of @xmath117 at @xmath142 for larger @xmath6 .",
    "hence , both contributions reflect the effects of the split kondo peaks .",
    "the kondo resonance is suppressed by both a finite temperature @xmath5 and a bias voltage @xmath6 , otherwise the two external parameters act in a very different manner : a finite @xmath5 ( at @xmath7 ) induces a lowering of the kondo resonance peak height , whereas a finite @xmath6 ( at @xmath58 ) in addition splits the peak in two , see also upper panel of fig.[fig : spectral_djdt_vg1 ] . from previous results",
    "it is known that the differential conductance @xmath10 is not affected by this difference , since it shows qualitatively the same functional dependence on @xmath5 as on @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the question arises whether this holds also for @xmath3 .    to address this issue , in fig.[fig : djdt_u6 ] we show results for @xmath3 as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath5 , for @xmath49 and various @xmath54 , where the nonequilibrium calculations were obtained from amea and the equilibrium ones by nrg  .",
    "already from the equilibrium behavior displayed in the inset on the right one notices that the temperature dependence of @xmath3 is quite involved .",
    "apart from @xmath144 all curves exhibit sign changes   is already in the transition to the mixed valence regime . ] .",
    "these findings are in agreement with the results reported in ref .  , where the seebeck coefficient @xmath96 , i.e. eq.([eq : ds ] ) for @xmath145 , was investigated in detail for @xmath7 .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath3 determines the sign of @xmath96 .",
    "in general , @xmath3 vanishes for @xmath146 and also for @xmath47 .",
    "the latter can be understood from a sommerfeld expansion of eq.([eq : djdt_b ] )  @xcite which yields for @xmath3 a linear behavior in @xmath5 for @xmath147 .",
    "the vanishing @xmath3 for small @xmath5 can be observed in the inset of the right panel in fig.[fig : djdt_u6 ] .",
    "in contrast , the left panel reveals that for @xmath148 the thermoelectric property @xmath3 approaches a finite , even @xmath149-dependent value .",
    "this is a first indication of the different dependence of @xmath3 on temperature and on bias voltage .    in order to investigate the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath3 in the kondo regime we consider @xmath57 , which corresponds approximately to the position of the maximum of @xmath3 as a function of temperature ( for @xmath58 ) ( see inset in right panel ) .",
    "the results for the dependence on @xmath6 are shown in the first two panels of fig.[fig : djdt_u6 ] .",
    "the larger errors in the derivative for small values of @xmath150 are due to the reduced accuracy of the amea fit , see also app.[sec : fit ] . in this case ,",
    "the characteristic scale that governs the decrease of @xmath3 with @xmath6 is @xmath1 and not the kondo temperature @xmath0 .",
    "the appearance of additional energy scales proportional to @xmath1 has been also found in the equilibrium thermoelectric properties of the siam  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the functional dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath151 ( for @xmath57 ) and on @xmath152 ( for @xmath7 ) is provided in the second and third panel of fig.[fig : djdt_u6 ] , both with logarithmic abscissa starting at @xmath153 .",
    "we note that for @xmath57 and @xmath7 the results obtained from amea and from nrg agree quite well .",
    "the equilibrium ( @xmath5-dependent ) and nonequilibrium ( @xmath6-dependent ) data behave similarly only for large values of the gate voltage ( @xmath144 ) , while they deviate from each other as a function of @xmath6 or @xmath5 for small @xmath154 . in particular , in nonequilibrium the decrease of @xmath3 with @xmath6 is followed by a saturation to a finite ( positive ) value , whereas in equilibrium the oscillating behavior as a function of @xmath5 presents also sign changes . as a consequence , the resulting thermoelectric response of a siam in the kondo regime",
    "is characterized by pronounced differences .",
    "we finally note that the quantity @xmath3 is rather sensitive to details of the spectral function @xmath117 . differently to @xmath10 , which involves an effective averaging over the transport window ,",
    "@xmath3 is mainly determined by the response at @xmath155 , as discussed above .",
    "this explains the observed differences in the behavior of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath10 , between the dependence on @xmath5 in equilibrium and the one of @xmath6 in nonequilibrium .    in view of sensing applications we conclude that the response is maximal in proximity of the linear response regime for @xmath7 and moreover that fairly large gate voltages are advantageous .",
    "as illustrated by the results for @xmath144 considered here , a small plateau develops in the region up to @xmath156 in which @xmath3 is nearly constant .",
    "this might be improved by tuning the system to a temperature just below the maximum of @xmath3 and to @xmath7 , but further studies including also asymmetric couplings to the leads are required to assess the potential of quantum dot devices for nanoscale sensing applications .",
    "in the present work we have computed the nonequilibrium spectral and thermoelectric transport properties of a quantum dot , modeled by a siam in presence of both an external bias voltage @xmath6 and a temperature difference between the two leads . in particular , we focus on the differential response of the current to a temperature gradient @xmath3 in the kondo regime ( @xmath58 ) and investigated the different contributions and their behavior as a function of a bias voltage @xmath6 and @xmath5 for various values of the interaction strength @xmath22 and gate voltages @xmath54 . in the regime of strong interactions and sufficiently large bias voltages we provided a physical picture , based on the asymmetric suppression or enhancement of the split kondo peak .",
    "this characteristic nonequilibrium feature lead to a qualitatively different behavior with respect to the one observed in equilibrium as a function of temperature . a more detailed understanding is provided by analyzing the spectral function and its frequency - resolved response to @xmath157 .",
    "extending previous results  @xcite to particle - hole asymmetric situations , we were able to accurately resolve the splitting of the kondo peak in the spectral function with increasing bias voltage .",
    "we note that in contrast to previous works ( see e.g.  ref .  )",
    "we here report a clear observation of this splitting , which was not accessible before , and its evolution with increasing values of @xmath22 .",
    "in contrast to the particle - hole symmetric case , for a finite gate voltage a temperature reduction of @xmath4 in one lead , and the respective increase in the other one , induces an asymmetric response of the two kondo peaks .",
    "we also analyzed the implications on @xmath3 @xmath158 , which due to the different contributions exhibits a more complex behavior as a function of @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , @xmath3 is found to be more sensitive to details in the spectral function @xmath117 than the differential conductance @xmath10 , which displays a similar behavior as a function of both @xmath6 and @xmath5 . in the kondo regime",
    ", the behavior of @xmath3 reveals a rapid decrease with increasing @xmath6 , governed by a scale determined by the coupling strength @xmath1 .",
    "this finding is consistent with equilibrium results  @xcite .",
    "however , due to the complicated functional dependence of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath5 one may even achieve a plateau where @xmath3 varies only slightly for small nonzero @xmath6 .",
    "such a regime is obtained by tuning either @xmath5 or @xmath1 and may be promising in view of sensing applications .",
    "the presented results for @xmath3 and their understanding in nonequilibrium contribute to assess the potential of quantum dots as possible nanoscale temperature sensors .",
    "we would like to thank m. sorantin , d. fugger , i. titvinidze , h. g. evertz , t. costi , v. zlatic and k. held for fruitful discussions .",
    "we acknowledge financial support from the austrian science fund ( fwf ) within projects f41 ( sfb vicom ) and p26508 , from the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) through for 723 , zuk 63 , and sfb / trr 21 , and from nawi graz .",
    "the calculations were partly performed on the d - cluster graz and on the vsc-3 cluster vienna .",
    "in order to evaluate eq.([eq : djdt ] ) in nonequilibrium @xmath9 one needs to calculate @xmath102 in eq.([eq : djdt_a ] ) numerically .",
    "details on this are given here .",
    "amea consists of two major steps : ( i ) the mapping procedure , and ( ii ) the many - body solution . in ( i ) we optimize all available bath parameters in the auxiliary system for a given number of bath sites @xmath109 in order to reproduce the hybridization function of the physical system @xmath159 , eq.([eq : dhyb ] ) , by the auxiliary one @xmath160 as accurately as possible .",
    "this is done through a fit on the real @xmath106-axis and with a parallel tempering ( pt ) routine  @xcite , see ref .  .",
    "we thus aim at solving a global optimization problem in the fit .",
    "once the optimal bath parameters are obtained we thereafter proceed to step ( ii ) and treat the many - body problem . in ref .",
    "we presented a solution strategy based on matrix product states , which we also make use of in the present work .",
    "@xmath161 is estimated by finite differences .",
    "first we compute for a certain @xmath6 the fit for the particle - hole symmetric case at @xmath42 , in the manner just described above ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "thereafter , we introduce a small finite temperature difference @xmath162 , start the fit from the bath parameters obtained for @xmath42 and optimize only locally  . by this ,",
    "the fit for @xmath163 is close in parameter space to the one for @xmath42 and we can thus estimate the linear response with respect to @xmath4 . in order to approximate a derivative by finite differences",
    "accurately it would be appropriate , in principle , to consider various stencils with varying values of @xmath4 . since this would require a major computational effort in the many - body calculation we consider here for simplicity only two values @xmath164 .",
    "note further that these two fits are connected by a particle - hole transformation . on the whole ,",
    "to compute @xmath165 for a certain @xmath6 and @xmath5 we thus perform three many - body calculations with @xmath42 , @xmath164 . the derivative is then approximated by the central finite difference and we estimate the uncertainty by the leading order correction of the forward/ backward finite difference , namely @xmath166 .",
    "the required second order derivative can be estimated by the difference of the forward and backward finite difference .    already on the level of the mapping procedure , i.e. before solving the many - body problem",
    ", one can check how well the finite difference approach works with the chosen @xmath109 and @xmath4 . for this",
    "we compute the derivative of the hybridization function .",
    "the derivative of the physical hybridization function eq.([eq : dhyb ] ) of the original impurity problem can be carried out analytically .",
    "the temperature difference enters only through the keldysh component , so that @xmath167 and the expression for @xmath168 is obtained by differentiating the fermi functions in eqs.([eq : dhyb ] ) and ( [ eq : fdt ] ) .",
    "a comparison of the estimated derivatives versus the exact ones is shown in fig.[fig : fits ] for a representative set of bias voltages .",
    "overall , a good agreement is found .",
    "larger differences occur for instance at @xmath150 , where the retarded part is clearly nonzero and also the keldysh part exhibits more deviations .",
    "this is also reflected in the large error bars for @xmath150 in the computed current derivatives presented in sec.[sec : results ] . in general , in the results in fig.[fig : djdt_vg1 ] and fig.[fig : djdt_u6 ] one can note that rather large error bars are present , even though the fit at @xmath42 is very accurate   for @xmath169 . here",
    ", we used @xmath111 for an increased temperature of @xmath57 , which improves the costfunction values @xmath170 nearly by one order of magnitude . ] and also the derivatives as shown in fig.[fig : fits ] are reasonably well described .",

    "<S> we study nonequilibrium thermoelectric transport properties of a correlated impurity connected to two leads for temperatures below the kondo scale . at finite bias , </S>",
    "<S> for which a current flows across the leads , we investigate the differential response of the current to a temperature gradient . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we compare the influence of a bias voltage and of a finite temperature on this thermoelectric response . </S>",
    "<S> this is of interest from a fundamental point of view to better understand the two different decoherence mechanisms produced by a bias voltage and by temperature . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that in this respect the thermoelectric response behaves differently from the electric conductance . in particular , while the latter displays a similar qualitative behavior as a function of voltage and temperature , both in theoretical and experimental investigations , qualitative differences occur in the case of the thermoelectric response . in order to understand this effect </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the different contributions in connection to the behavior of the impurity spectral function versus temperature . especially in the regime of strong interactions and large enough bias voltages </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a simple picture based on the asymmetric suppression or enhancement of the split kondo peaks as a function of the temperature gradient . besides the academic interest </S>",
    "<S> , these studies could additionally provide valuable information to assess the applicability of quantum dot devices as responsive nanoscale temperature sensors . </S>"
