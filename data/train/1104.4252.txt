    "we conclude this introduction by observing that while quantum cramr ",
    "rao bounds are intended for vector parameter models , there is no general relation between the various quantum information inequalities when the parameter is a vector @xcite .",
    "hence , in the following , we will restrict our attention to one - parameter models .",
    "this paper is concerned with two quantum analogs of classical expected fisher information that arise by generalizing to the quantum setting the following expressions @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a random variable characterized by the distribution @xmath14 with density @xmath15 with respect to the @xmath16-finite measure @xmath17 on @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the unknown parameter of interest and the usual regularity conditions apply @xcite .",
    "the first equation bears a conceptual meaning , being the expected value of the square score function @xmath21 , while the second is just an equivalent formulation .",
    "if the random variable @xmath22 describes an experiment in a quantum system , then its probability law depends on the state of the system , denoted by @xmath1 , as it is specified by the unknown parameter , and on the measurement @xmath4 that is carried out in the system , in the following way ( trace rule for probability ) : @xmath23 more formally , @xmath24 is a density matrix , that is , a self - adjoint , non - negative and trace - one linear operator acting on an a @xmath25-dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath26 , and @xmath4 is a probability operator - valued measure , that is , a set of non - negative self - adjoint linear operators defined on the measure space @xmath18 and taking values in @xmath27 , such that @xmath28 , the identity operator , @xmath29 , the null operator , and @xmath30 if @xmath31 , for all @xmath32 , @xmath33 . whenever @xmath34 , the hilbert space @xmath35 can be identified with the @xmath25-dimensional euclidean complex space @xmath36 endowed with the standard inner product and it is equivalent to refer to self - adjoint operators or to hermitian matrices .",
    "if @xmath4 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath17 on @xmath18 , such that @xmath37 for all @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is non - negative and hermitian , then @xmath40 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath17 and the density of @xmath22 is @xmath41 the expected value of the random variable @xmath22 is @xmath42 combining ( [ eq : i1 ] ) or ( [ eq : i2 ] ) with ( [ eq : p(x , q ) ] ) , we obtain the classical expected fisher information @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the matrix whose @xmath45th generic element is the derivative with respect to @xmath0 of the generic element of @xmath1 , that is , @xmath46_{ij}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}[\\rho(\\theta ) ] _ { ij}$ ] .",
    "quantum analogs of classical information are obtained without performing any measurement on the system .",
    "the density matrix @xmath1 plays the role of the density @xmath15 and the expected value of any observable @xmath47 , defined as a self - adjoint operator , is @xmath48 .",
    "note that by defining @xmath49 , we have the formal connection with the expected value of the random variable @xmath22 .",
    "helstrom @xcite obtained the quantum information @xmath6 by generalizing ( [ eq : i1 ] ) to the operator - valued quantum setting via the symmetric logarithmic derivative , which is the self - adjoint operator @xmath50 implicitly defined by the relation @xmath51.\\label{eq : sld}\\ ] ] the result is @xmath52 which , in fact , is the expected value of the ( observable ) square symmetric @xmath50 .",
    "the quantity @xmath50 is also known as the _ quantum score _ since , besides ( [ eq : ih ] ) , it satisfies @xmath53 ( see @xcite , page  789 ) .",
    "the proof of the information inequality ( [ eq : infineq ] ) for the one - dimensional parameter case is based on the cauchy ",
    "schwarz inequality with hilbert ",

    "the proof can be shortened by observing that , in pure states , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( see @xcite ,  equation ( 3.1 ) ) , from which ( [ eq : wyhp ] ) clearly follows by direct comparison with ( [ eq : iwy ] ) .    according to quantum state estimation theory , pure states represent the best knowledge one can have about some specific properties of the system under observation .",
    "mixed states , obtained as convex combinations of pure states , indicate a situation of partial knowledge of the system .",
    "they represent probabilistic mixtures , in the sense that the system under observation is in the state @xmath63 with probability @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .    to obtain a relation between helstrom and wigner  yanase information in mixed states , it is necessary to express both of the information quantities as functions of common variables ( up to some transformation ) , such as , for example , the corresponding information quantities in the mixing pure states . in this setting",
    ", the main difficulty is related to helstrom information since explicit solutions of ( [ eq : sld ] ) when @xmath1 is a mixed state are not usually available in a convenient form .",
    "restricting to mixtures of two - dimensional orthogonal pure states allows this difficulty to be overcome and also a suitable expression for skew information to be derived .",
    "two - dimensional systems play a crucial role in quantum mechanics .",
    "electrons , qubits and spin-@xmath67 particles are just some examples of systems in @xmath68 . in addition , two - dimensional mixtures of orthogonal states have an appealing geometric interpretation , based on the bloch ( or poincar , or riemann ) sphere representation of states in two - dimensional complex hilbert spaces by means of unit vectors in the real three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "in fact , if @xmath69 , then the set of pure states is the surface of the unit sphere and the set of mixed states is the interior of the corresponding unit ball ( see @xcite ) .",
    "mixtures of two pure states can be represented as points in the interior of the sphere , on the straight line joining the two points on the surface .",
    "if the generating pure states are orthogonal ( opposite on the sphere ) , then the corresponding mixed states lie on the diameters of the great circles and therefore the set of such states with given weights can be represented by the spheres embedded in the unit sphere with the same center , but with radius less than one and dependent on the weights of the mixtures .",
    "specifically , we shall consider all of the spheres embedded in the unit sphere with the same center and radius equal to @xmath70 , where @xmath71 determines the weights of the mixture .",
    "a one - parameter two - dimensional mixed state can be represented as @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are orthogonal pure states , in the sense that @xmath75 and @xmath76 is a function of @xmath0 taking values in the real interval @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "note that orthogonal pure states are such that @xmath79 and @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath82 and @xmath83 the term - by - term first derivative and the symmetric logarithmic derivative of @xmath84 , with respect to @xmath0 , respectively , and by @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the helstrom and wigner  yanase information extracted from the pure state @xmath87 , respectively .",

    "the proof of ( [ eq : iwyandih ] ) is based on the comparison with helstrom information derived in @xcite , lemma  2 , where a specific choice of @xmath98 and @xmath99 was made in order to derive the symmetric logarithmic derivative of the mixed state as a function of the symmetric logarithmic derivative of @xmath100 , @xmath101 the boundary conditions on @xmath89 ensure that @xmath102 and @xmath103 when @xmath104 and imply that @xmath105 when @xmath106 . hence , they encompass the case where the mixing coefficient does not depend on @xmath0 ( @xmath107 @xmath108 ) .    in the analysis of the relation between @xmath9 and @xmath11 , we first consider the latter case , that is , @xmath109 does not depend on @xmath0 , which implies that @xmath110 where @xmath111 is function of @xmath109 , symmetric with respect to @xmath112 , where it reaches its minimum of  1 , and with maximum of 2 at @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the implications are evident : when the mixing coefficients tend to @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the skew information tends to be twice the helstrom information since the mixture tends to reproduce a pure state system .",
    "conversely , when @xmath117 , the distance between the two quantum information quantities reaches its minimum , in that they tend to be equal .",
    "the limit case @xmath117 is of special interest to us , so we shall return to it in the discussion of proposition  [ prop1 ] for the case where @xmath109 depends on @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , both @xmath9 and @xmath6 are smaller than the corresponding information quantities in the pure states .",
    "this is coherent with quantum theory , according to which pure states represent the best knowledge that one can have about a quantum system .    on the other hand ,",
    "if the mixing coefficients depend on @xmath0 , then a sufficient condition for @xmath118 and @xmath119 is that @xmath120 which follows by simple algebraic manipulation of ( [ eq : iwyms ] ) and ( [ eq : ihms ] ) , together with the identity @xmath121 .",
    "in other words , it is sufficient that the condition @xmath119 is satisfied to ensure that @xmath118 .",

    "in particular , if @xmath123 , then @xmath124 and @xmath125 so that we find @xmath126 .",
    "hence , we can state the following corollary to proposition  [ prop1 ] .",

    "rao bound increases as long as the mixture approaches the maximum entropy case .",

    "knowledge of @xmath133 is equivalent to knowledge of @xmath134 ( up to a constant factor , they are equal ) ; in mixed states , the distance between the two quantum information quantities depends on the probability of being in a ( one - dimensional ) space rather than on its orthogonal complement .",
    "the same distance between @xmath6 and @xmath9 decreases as long as the knowledge of the system diminishes , eventually tending to zero in the maximum entropy case ( uniform distribution on the coefficients ) .",
    "we derived the relation between helstrom and wigner  yanase information in two - dimensional mixed - state systems , where a geometric interpretation of the states as spheres embedded in the unit sphere can be drawn .",

    "it is evident that the two information quantities ( [ eq : iwymsgen ] ) and ( [ eq : ihmsgen ] ) are sensibly comparable only under some specific assumptions on the state of the quantum system , like those we have made in section [ sec : crb ] . moreover , the two expressions do not explicitly depend on the mixing coefficients , nor on the mixing pure states , so their formal equivalence loses its interpretation .",
    "nevertheless , rewriting @xmath9 in ( [ eq : iwymsgen ] ) as a function of @xmath6 in ( [ eq : ihmsgen ] ) provides an eigenvalue - based condition of equality between the two quantum information quantities , one which allows us to derive a result equivalent to corollary  [ cor1 ] in section [ sec : crb ] , that is , an approximate quantum cramr ",

    "in fact , if @xmath217 , then @xmath218 both if @xmath219 , by ( [ eq : tr_null ] ) , and if @xmath220 , by ( [ eq : rholrhom ] ) , and by the cyclical properties of the trace operator ; on the other hand , if @xmath214 , then @xmath221 for all  @xmath222 .    therefore , it follows that @xmath6 can be simplified as @xmath223 where we have distinguished the case @xmath224 from the case @xmath225 . now , note that , when @xmath224 , the trace in the second summand is null unless @xmath217 , as follows by ( [ eq : rholrhom ] ) . using the same arguments , but applied to @xmath226 in the third summand , we can simplify the final expression of helstrom information in a generic mixed state as    @xmath227      let us consider equation ( [ eq : iwymsgen ] ) .",
    "we observe that @xmath228 , as follows by @xmath229 , a consequence of the spectral identity @xmath230 .",
    "hence , @xmath231 by replacing , in the above equation , the first term on the right - hand side by the same quantity obtained from ( [ eq : ihmsgen ] ) as a function of @xmath6 , and rearranging , we obtain the claimed result .",
    "i would like to thank the editor and a referee for their comments ."
