    "coherent state quantum computing ( csqc ) @xcite is an optical approach to quantum computing which relies solely on linear optics , state preparation and measurement , rather than in - line optical nonlinearities . unlike in single photon linear optical quantum computing ( loqc ) @xcite  where qubits are encoded in the polarisation , path , frequency etc . of single photons  in csqc , qubits are encoded in the phase and amplitude of coherent states .",

    "increasing the amplitude to @xmath132 does not have much effect on teleporting the odd cat state ( and its approximations ) , but it does decrease the fidelity for the other states . in attempting high - fidelity experiments , low loss levels will be essential when teleporting states similar to @xmath95 and @xmath106 .",
    "states closer to @xmath142 , @xmath28 and their approximations are more forgiving .      in the entanglement swapping protocol , we treat modes @xmath12 and @xmath10 as the input state to the teleporter and ignore loss in these modes in the analysis of the effects of loss on the teleporter , which has been modeled in much the same way as in section [ sec : error_tele ] .",
    "we were only able to get reliable fidelities for @xmath120 as higher values of @xmath40 would require higher truncation of the photon number which , for a 7-mode calculation , was not computationally tractable .",

    "we have shown that the squeezed single photon can be used to teleport a coherent state , a squeezed single photon and a squeezed vacuum , which despite not being a very good resource for teleportation itself , is a good approximation to an even cat state at very small amplitudes .",
    "in - principle teleportation of arbitrary coherent state superpositions can be demonstrated using the squeezed single photons as inputs to an entanglement swapping protocol .",

    "teleportation is the implementation of the identity gate and these results suggest that demonstration of more complicated non - trivial gates will be practical in the foreseeable future .",
    "our analysis of the effects of imperfect source preparation and inefficient detection has shown this setup to be very fragile in this regard .",
    "it would be possible to do high - fidelity teleportation of states like the coherent state and the even cat state with a lossy system , but states which are more similar to the odd cat state degrade very quickly , even with low loss .",
    "it looks like this fragility is a property of the gate , and not just the approximation of the states , however , at higher amplitudes , the fidelity is further affected by loss when using the approximate states .    in this paper",
    "we have analysed coherent state teleportation using small - amplitude approximations to cat states , however , there has been progress in creating larger amplitude cat state approximations via cat state amplification @xcite and ancilla - assisted photon - subtraction @xcite ."
