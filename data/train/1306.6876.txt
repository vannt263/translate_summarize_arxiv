    "based on an alternative exploration of the electro - weak ( ew ) symmetry breaking mechanism , composite higgs models with a higgs state as a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) are more and more taken into account by the physics community as one of the most elegant solutions to the standard model ( sm ) hierarchy problem ( see  @xcite for a comprehensive review ) . here , we propose a framework generally known as 4-dimensional composite higgs model ( 4dchm )  @xcite .",
    "such scenario is based on the minimal coset @xmath1 which contains 4 pngbs , one of them becoming the physical higgs particle as a composite state from an extra - dynamic .",
    "the sm matter content is accompanied by new states : @xmath2 s , @xmath3 s , @xmath4 s , @xmath5 s and quarks with non - standard electro - magnetic charge .    after the recent discovery by the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations , we have devoted our efforts to the evaluation of the compatibility of such a particle with the 4dchm . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we delivered a @xmath0 fit involving the data of the higgs coupling analysis at the lhc available before the xlviii rencontres de moriond . here",
    ", we provide an update of the aforementioned study in the light of the latest lhc data .",
    "to pursue our goal , we introduce the @xmath6 parameters : @xmath7/\\big[\\sigma(pp\\to hx)|_{\\rm sm}\\times { \\rm br}(h\\to yy)|_{\\rm sm}\\big]$ ] , where @xmath8 identifies any possible two - body higgs decay channel and @xmath9 is related to any state which is produced in association to the boson . in our previous study",
    "@xcite we analysed the cases @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the light of the old atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite data for the main higgs production channels at the lhc : gluon - gluon fusion , higgs - strahlung and vector - boson fusion .",
    "then , we selected five sets of points in the 4dchm parameter space for five different combinations of the composite scale @xmath14 and the coupling @xmath15 which we referred to as `` benchmarks '' , each of them containing @xmath16 points that are able to satisfy the following constraints : they must allow a reconstruction of the physical values @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , with the requirement that @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 lie in a range which is permitted by the particle data group ( pdg )  @xcite , while for the top , bottom and higgs running masses we have used @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . with regard to the bounds from ew precision tests , we avoided them by requiring a mass of the extra gauge bosons of 2 tev or larger ( see  @xcite ) . by making use of the latest atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite data presented at the xlviii",

    "[ fig : crosssections ] we show the update of our previous results . in the left frame we plot the point distributions for each relevant higgs boson decay channel ,",

    "8 - 9 of  @xcite and fig .",
    "[ fig : crosssections ] of this note , we notice that there are no remarkable changes on the overall conclusions , nevertheless it is interesting to look closely at the impact of the new data on our fits .",
    "first of all , from tab .  [ tab : r ] we immediately spot the differences between the old and new data : the atlas collaboration has lately measured a mean value of @xmath26 which is greater than previously ( well - above the sm expectation , while the old data were pointing more or less at the sm value ) , whereas the cms collaboration is no longer measuring an excess in @xmath27 . in a few words ,",
    "we prudently say that the status of the experimental searches reveals a tension between the two collaborations regarding their findings with respect to the sm expected values . as an obvious consequence , both the sm and",
    "the 4dchm fits worsen , but such common trend operates in favour of the 4dchm . actually , the overall suppression of the mean values observed by cms acts as a stabiliser for the distribution of the 4dchm points , especially for lower values of @xmath14 ( while higher values tend to better adhere to the sm ) . still being hard to accommodate a good @xmath0 fit using both atlas and cms data ,",
    "the 4dchm better reflects the habit for the higgs boson in such a model to show an overall suppression of the coupling with fermions and bosons .",
    "in this note we updated our analysis of the higgs couplings of the 4dchm , using the most recent available data from atlas and cms released during the xlviii rencontres de moriond .",
    "our previous conclusions ( see  @xcite ) are left unchanged .",
