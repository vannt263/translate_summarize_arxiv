    "once fted but now rarely mentioned paper , titled politely _ a note on uncertainty and indifference curves _ , the norwegian insurance theorist and economist karl @xcite argued that the mean  variance theory of investment , invented and popularized by markowitz ( @xcite , @xcite ) , is logically absurd . in this delightfully provocative note , @xcite proved , he claimed , that it is impossible to draw indifference curves in the mean  variance @xmath1 or mean  standard deviation @xmath0 plane .",
    "the same proof appears in at least two other works by borch ( @xcite , @xcite ) , who concluded that mean  variance is an interesting but not serious alternative to expected utility :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ @xmath2 i shall continue to use mean  variance analysis in teaching , but i shall warn students that such analysis must not be taken seriously and applied in practice ( @xcite , page 430 ) .",

    "mean  variance ( mv ) analysis , for which markowitz later won a nobel prize in economic sciences , has become by far the most recognized decision framework in the practice of business decision - making , including especially capital budgeting ( e.g. , whether to build a new factory ) , investment management ( e.g. , whether to increase the weight of oil stocks in a pension fund ) and corporate financial valuation ( e.g. , whether a firm is worth its current value on the stock market ) .",
    "each of these common applications is built implicitly on mv , and explicitly on the so - called `` capital asset pricing model '' ( capm ) that arose as a corollary from the mv foundations set out by markowitz .",
    "although business applications of mv portfolio theory and the capm are commonplace , and effectively the industry standard ( witness any modern textbook in financial economics ) , proponents of this decision framework remain conscious that the proven philosophical foundations of decision analysis under uncertainty remain the axioms and theorems of expected utility theory ( eu ) , formalized by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "utility theory , or more specifically the maximization of subjective expected utility satisfying the von neumann  morgenstern or similar axioms , remains the hallmark of rationality in economics and statistical decision analysis ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . as a mark of respect for this intellectual legacy",
    ", @xcite devoted his 1990 nobel lecture to an empirical comparison of his mv methods of portfolio with a model based on eu theory .",
    "authoritative recognition also goes the other way . in its second edition , one of the standard references on neoclassical decision theory",
    ", @xcite contains an elegant exposition of the mv investment framework , albeit without reconciliation with other explicitly eu parts of the book . completing the circle , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have lately pointed to an early paper in italian , authored by @xcite , the most revered of all subjective probability theorists , as having been first to express a formal model of decision - making within a mv framework .",
    "two further expositions concentrated on de finetti s previously little - known anticipation of markowitz are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our primary purpose is to examine the historical literature surrounding borch s paradox . to assist readers who are not familiar with this branch of applied statistical literature ,",
    "we first recount the basic elements of investment decision - making under the two competing conceptual frameworks , expected utility and mean  variance .",
    "we then consider how mv can be justified on axiomatic foundations , in the face of critics such as borch , and by comparison with eu theory generally .",
    "finally , to better understand the practical appeal of mv methods , and why finance theory so readily adopted the language of mv over eu , we introduce the capital asset pricing model ( capm ) and observe how such a theoretically insightful model arose almost automatically once decisions were depicted in terms of mv rather than eu .",
    "a decision is a choice between some ( usually strict ) subset of all of the available `` lotteries , '' `` assets , '' `` investments '' ( these terms are synonyms)and all feasible weighted portfolios thereof .",
    "each such uncertain prospect reduces to a probability distribution over a domain of possible payoffs .",
    "decision - making is therefore boiled down to a choice between different possible probability distributions of returns .",
    "@xcite proposed an axiomatic theory of how to decide between known probability distributions ( of payoffs ) . in brief , they proved deductively that if decision - making is logical in the sense that it obeys certain specified basic axioms of coherence or rationality , then implicitly the decision - maker must act _ as if _ her objective is to maximize expected utility @xmath3=\\int_{x}f(x)u(x)$ ] , where @xmath4 is a real - valued function representing the utility obtained from certain wealth or payoff @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the probability density function of @xmath5 .",

    "there are five essential axioms of expected utility : ( i ) _ completeness_. all lotteries @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be ranked relative to one another , @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 , where @xmath13 indicates indifference .",

    "similar expositions are found in many textbooks both in economics and statistics .",
    "see , for example , ingersoll ( @xcite ) , pages 3044 , huang and litzenberger ( @xcite ) , pages 111 , and levy ( @xcite ) , pages 2530 . in brief , by assuming the primitive preference relationships , it is shown that lottery @xmath8 is preferred to lottery @xmath9 if and only if the expected utility of lottery @xmath8 exceeds the expected utility of lottery @xmath9 .",
    "expected utility @xmath3 $ ] is therefore the proven measure by which to rank uncertain investments .",
    "the usual assumption in economics is that decision - makers are risk averse .",
    "this means that they have positive but diminishing marginal utility for money , and hence @xmath4 is increasing and concave . a risk averse decision - maker will not accept any lottery with an expected money value of zero ( or less ) . actuarially fair bets are thus unacceptable . before accepting a bet to win or lose some fixed sum @xmath34 , a risk averse agent",
    "requires that the probability of winning exceeds 0.5 by some premium .",
    "the amount of this premium depends on the local concavity of @xmath4 or on how fast the marginal utility of money is diminishing in the region of wealth @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is her starting wealth .",
    "technically , the pratt  arrow measure of local absolute risk aversion @xmath37 captures the degree of concavity of @xmath38 or the rate at which marginal utility is decreasing at wealth @xmath5 .",
    "the following quick summary of mv owes much to @xcite .",
    "the one - period return on an investment over period @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the time @xmath39 asset price and @xmath42 is the income ( dividend ) drawn from the asset in period @xmath39 .",

    "imagine a set of available investments or `` assets '' .",
    "these can be combined into arbitrarily weighted portfolios ( e.g. , the investor might form a 2:1 weighted portfolio of assets a and b , where two - thirds of her money is invested in a and one - third in b ) . the available assets and their linearly weighted portfolios form an opportunity set of investments . each possible",
    "asset or portfolio presents a compromise between mean return @xmath43 and variance @xmath44 .",
    "each such mv pair is reduced following markowitz and finance convention to its parameters @xmath45 .",
    "the opportunity set is then a region of feasible @xmath45 pairs .",
    "this region is depicted in its characteristic shape by the bullet - like shaded area in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the investor is generally risk averse and thus prefers portfolios with higher mean return @xmath43 and lower `` risk '' ( standard deviation ) @xmath46 .",
    "the opportunity set is reduced therefore to just those portfolios on the thick black arc called the `` efficient frontier '' . each asset portfolio on the efficient frontier dominates all assets and portfolios to its southeast , because these have both lower @xmath43 and higher @xmath46 .",
    "for example , asset @xmath45-pair @xmath47 dominates all assets and portfolios in the hatched region.=1    to choose between all efficient portfolios , the investor forms a family of mv indifference curves .",
    "these are understood as equivalue curves defined by some indifference function @xmath48 .",
    "each such curve shows the locus of @xmath45 points for which @xmath48 is held constant .",
    "a typical looking family of indifference curves is shown by the dotted lines in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "these curves are drawn convex downwards on the basis that , for assets known only by their mv parameters @xmath49 , the risk averse investor requires marginally greater compensation in @xmath43 for each further increment in risk @xmath46 ( see @xcite , for related proofs ) . since risk averse investors prefer lower @xmath46 for fixed @xmath43 , higher ( more northwesterly ) indifference curves represent greater expected utility to the investor .",
    "having established both the efficient frontier and an indifference function @xmath48 , the unique mv - optimal investment in risky assets is located at the point of tangency @xmath50 between the decision - maker s own @xmath48 and the exogenous efficient frontier .",
    "borch ( @xcite ) , pages 2 and 3 , presented a proof based on assets with two - point distributions that revealed ( he claimed ) that it is impossible to draw indifference curves in the mean  variance @xmath1 or mean  standard deviation @xmath0 plane .",
    "borch repeated this same proof in 1973 and 1974 , and wrote openly of his frustration that it was not more widely acknowledged by theorists developing portfolio optimization methods :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ i have on several occasions ( 1969 ) and ( 1974 ) tried to warn against the uncritical use of mean  variance analysis .",

    "first , assume that two assets ( payoff distributions ) with parameters @xmath51 and @xmath52 are regarded , on the basis of those parameters alone , as indifferent ( i.e. , of equal subjective merit ) .",
    "now imagine two hypothetical assets constructed simply as two - point distributions",
    ". produces payoff @xmath53 with probability @xmath54 and payoff @xmath5 with probability @xmath55 .",
    "asset 2 produces payoff @xmath56 with probability @xmath54 and payoff @xmath5 with probability @xmath55 . by common sense or some very basic axiom like the `` sure thing '' principle raised by savage ( borch cites allais concept of `` preference absolue '' ) ,",
    "these two assets are indifferent if and only if @xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "now , suppose that the constants @xmath5 , @xmath54 , @xmath53 and @xmath56 take values @xmath59 borch did not make any mention of where these equations come from or what they assume , except to say that it is easy to verify that the implied values of the mean and variance parameters of the two assets are , respectively , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , thus matching assets  1 and 2 ( this is indeed easily verified ) .",
    "the final step in borch s proof holds that because the two assets can be of equal merit only if @xmath62 , the indifference condition @xmath63 is @xmath64 implying that @xmath65 and , hence , indifference requires that @xmath66 and @xmath67 according to borch s interpretation of this result , any supposed indifference between two arbitrary mean  variance pairs is impossible , unless of course they are the same .",
    "mean  variance indifference curves are thus merely points rather than curves , or , in borch s [ ( @xcite ) , page 3 ] own words , `` it is impossible to draw indifference curves in the e  s - plane '' ( e and s denote the mean and standard deviation ) .    in answer to any suspicion raised by their nonexplanation",
    ", there is nothing contrived about the four equations used by borch to define the constants @xmath5 , @xmath54 , @xmath53 and @xmath56 in his proof .",
    "rather , these can be derived by writing the standard equations for the means and standard deviations , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , of the two borch two - point assets in terms of @xmath5 , @xmath54 , @xmath53 and @xmath56 , and then solving these four equations simultaneously to get general expressions for all four constants in terms of the specified means and standard deviations .",
    "it follows , therefore , that the four borch equations , numbered ( [ equ1])([equ4 ] ) above , are not merely sufficient conditions to produce the specified mean  variance parameters @xmath51 and @xmath61 .",
    "rather , they follow necessarily from those specified parameter values as one of two possible sets of solutions .",
    "the second set of solutions , which borch did not raise but could have employed to the same effect , is as follows : @xmath72      borch interprets his paradox to say that mean  variance indifference curves can not exist .",
    "this is too strong , as will be seen in the sections below .",
    "more reasonable interpretations of borch s proof are as follows .",
    "_ interpretation _ 1 : suppose that a decision - maker is adamant that he is indifferent between any two assets with mean  variance characteristics @xmath51 and @xmath61 , where @xmath73 .",
    "it is possible to construct two - point assets with these very characteristics between which no one can reasonably be indifferent [ these can be constructed by borch s equations ( [ equ1])([equ4 ] ) , or equally well with the second possible set of solutions noted above ] .",
    "this possibility does not imply that there are no possible assets with parameters @xmath51 and @xmath74 that are rationally ( to someone ) indifferent .",
    "rather , it shows that the decision - maker can not be indifferent between all imaginable pairs of assets with these parameters .",
    "_ interpretation _ 2 : if we limit consideration to only the particular subclass of two - point assets constructed by borch , there exists no pair of assets with @xmath75 between which anyone might reasonably be indifferent .",
    "rather , whenever @xmath73 , the two assets ( having @xmath5 and @xmath54 in common ) necessarily differ in that @xmath76 , which of itself means that they can not be indifferent .      here",
    "we exemplify _ interpretation _ 1 numerically .",
    "imagine that the subject of the experiment feels that he is indifferent between any two assets with parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78.such subjective indifference would typically require that the security with the bigger mean has the bigger variance , but that practicality is not necessary in borch s demonstration .",
    "now consider two comparable lottery tickets , ticket a and ticket b. ticket a pays @xmath79 with probability @xmath80 and @xmath81 with probability @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , ticket b pays @xmath82 with probability @xmath80 and @xmath81 with probability @xmath55 .",
    "the mean  variance parameters of these two lotteries are @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "yet contrary to any thought that two assets with these parameters are indifferent , ticket b is obviously preferred because it has the same probability of winning as ticket  a , and the same payoff if it loses , but pays 45 instead of 25 when it wins .",
    "borch saw this apparent contradiction as proof that the decision - maker can not logically be indifferent between two investments by reference only to their means and variances.=1",
    "borch s paradox is well known to those economic theorists mindful of foundations and interested in the history of mean  variance , yet is largely unknown elsewhere and goes unmentioned in standard finance and financial economics texts , even in highly sophisticated works such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and pennacchi ( @xcite ) that deal with the connections between mean  variance models and expected utility theory .",
    "neither is borch mentioned in the very thorough historical annotated bibliography of @xcite .",
    "this omission is justified perhaps by the findings of a similarly important but now rarely mentioned paper by @xcite .",
    "baron rebuts borch s paradox in two steps .",
    "first comes the proposition that decision - making based on just the two parameters , mean and variance , implies an underlying quadratic utility function .",
    "the same argument arises in hanoch and levy [ ( @xcite ) , page 182 ] and sarnat [ ( @xcite ) , page 687 ] who both note that quadratic ( second order polynomial ) utility is the only form of mathematical utility function for which expected utility reduces to a function of just the first two moments of the payoff distribution . specifically , for risk - averse quadratic utility @xmath85 , the expected utility is @xmath86 = 2a\\mu-(\\mu^{2}+\\sigma^{2})$ ] .",
    "similarly , see the derivation by liu ( @xcite ) , page 233 .",
    "the presumption that mv necessarily implies quadratic utility traces to markowitz [ ( @xcite ) , page 288 ] and also mossin ( @xcite ) , pages 26 and 27 .",
    "hanoch and levy [ ( @xcite ) , page 182 ] hold that `` rejection of quadratic utility implies the rejection of any analysis based on the expected utility maxim '' , which is indirectly saying that the only unconditional way of hanging onto eu while applying mv is to adopt quadratic utility . @xcite",
    "have more recently given an elementary proof revealing that , in the absence of any further premise , mv necessitates quadratic utility .",
    "having concluded that borch s proposed subjective value function can arise from only a quadratic utility function , baron s second step is to show that one of the asset pairs in borch s counterexample , @xmath87 and @xmath61 , must involve a potential payoff in the domain where quadratic utility is decreasing with money .",
    "this finding is easy to understand intuitively .",
    "the two borch assets are identical except that @xmath76 and , hence , the asset with the lower @xmath88 ( e.g. , asset 1 if @xmath89 ) can only be as good in someone s mind as the asset with the higher @xmath88 if that higher @xmath88 is in the domain where money has negative marginal utility , thus allowing @xmath53 and @xmath56 to have the same utility @xmath90 .",
    "the net effect of baron s argument can be summarized as follows :    borch s paradox proves only that for any two mean  variance pairs , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , a rational decision - maker can not be indifferent between _ all _ pairs of assets with the specified parameters .",
    "indeed , precisely as borch revealed , there are easily definable assets with such characteristics which are obviously not indifferent .",
    "if the decision - maker has quadratic utility , eu can be written as a function of mean and variance alone and , hence , @xmath45 indifference curves do exist .",
    "it is necessary , however , to constrain the class of assets under consideration so as to exclude any asset with one ( or more than one ) potential payoff in the region where utility decreases with money .",
    "negative marginal utility for some @xmath5 is a well - known limitation of quadratic utility , and is bound to produce irrational or incoherent decisions even under eu if the admissible asset class is not suitably restricted .",
    "if assets with possible payoffs in the domain where quadratic utility decreases with money ( i.e. , where the last increment of payoff brings a reduction in utility ) are excluded a priori from consideration , as if they can not exist , then the class of counterexamples constructed by borch ( and illustrated numerically above ) no longer exists .",
    "another somewhat forgotten finding should bementioned here . taking mv as a representation of quadratic utility , and constraining all possible payoffs into the domain where quadratic utility is increasing , levy and sarnat [ ( @xcite ) , pages 387 and",
    "388 ] proved that one mv asset pair @xmath51 has higher utility than another @xmath61 , with @xmath91 , if and only if @xmath92 this is a stronger condition than the usual definition of dominance ( i.e. , @xmath93 and @xmath94 or @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) and is therefore more `` efficient '' in the sense that it reduces the class of possible investments to a smaller number .",
    "we now summarize our own disproof of generalized mean  variance analysis , very much in spirit with borch , and then side with baron by considering possible theoretical and practical restrictions on the admissible asset class that allow a partial reconciliation between the two ways of decision - making .    following a convention in finance dating to markowitz s original exposition of the mean  variance framework ,",
    "our analysis is set out in terms of the standard deviation @xmath46 rather than variance @xmath44 .",
    "adhering to another well - entrenched custom in the finance literature , we work with @xmath46 as abscissa and @xmath43 as ordinate .",
    "suppose there exists a value function @xmath97 that captures the merit or goodness of a @xmath45-asset such that larger @xmath98 implies greater value .",
    "indifference between two assets @xmath99 and @xmath100 means that @xmath101 .",
    "it is not necessary to be explicit about the form of @xmath98 .",
    "_ continuity - monotonicity - finiteness _",
    "( _ cmf _ ) _ axiom_. the merit function @xmath97 is continuous , strictly increasing in @xmath43 for every @xmath46 , and strictly decreasing in @xmath46 for every @xmath43 .",
    "these properties hold throughout the @xmath45 half - plane , @xmath102 .",
    "continuity implies that there is no abrupt change in merit as either @xmath103 or @xmath43 changes slightly .",
    "strict monotonicity reflects the merit , either positive or negative , of any change in @xmath43 or @xmath46 , however small .",
    "finiteness requires that any finite increase in @xmath46 can be offset by a sufficiently large finite increase in  @xmath43 .",
    "the existence of such a merit function implies transitivity , meaning that if asset x is preferred to y , and y to z , then x is preferred to z ( and likewise when preference is replaced by indifference ) .",
    "_ buridan s axiom_. if a decision - maker is indifferent between two assets @xmath104 and @xmath105 , then he must also be indifferent between either asset and a probability - mixture asset that yields ( the same payoff as ) @xmath104 with probability @xmath20 and ( the same payoff as ) @xmath105 with probability @xmath22 , where @xmath20 takes any value @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "thus , according to the merit function @xmath97 , indifference @xmath106 implies @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 represent the mean and standard deviation of an @xmath20-mixture of the two indifferent `` pure '' assets ( for any probability @xmath20 ) .",
    "note that buridan s axiom is a simple corollary of the independence axiom in eu .",
    "the question now is whether a decision analysis constructed solely in terms of @xmath45 can coexist with these two axioms .",

    "contrary to borch s paradox , it is possible to manufacture sensible @xmath155 indifference curves by either constraining the asset class ( in the way as described above ) or by placing other restrictions on the decision model that limit its theoretical generality and possible practical relevance .",
    "we now discuss the most common ways of forming workable indifference curves , by which we mean an mv decision framework that yields the same investment choices ( identical rankings of a given set of distributions ) as those based explicitly on  eu .",

    "since these circles have been obtained using expected utility , they automatically satisfy buridan .",
    "quadratic utility ( qu ) exhibits negative marginal utility beyond a point of personal satiation .",

    "it is essential to limit the analysis to asset pairs in the lower - left quadrant , where neither @xmath177 nor @xmath178 is greater than @xmath163 .     and @xmath178 .",
    "]    it is at first disconcerting that this constraint on @xmath5 did not arise in our `` first principles '' derivation in section  [ sec6 ] .",

    "the example depicted in figure  [ fig3 ] reveals clearly , however , that it is essential to exclude all such assets before taking on the convenience of working in terms of distribution moments @xmath45 .",
    "this example should be seen as an alternative version of borch s paradox .",
    "borch relied on his rather opaque counterexample to condemn mv analysis generally , but the more reasonable conclusion , recognized by baron , is that mv analysis can mimic a coherent application of eu under quadratic utility provided that the asset class is suitably restricted before the distributional properties of those assets are reduced to their parameters @xmath45 .",
    "this is the same restriction as is necessary for coherence under eu when assuming qu , and reflects a long - known defect of the quadratic utility function rather than any flaw in the mathematical restatement of expected quadratic utility in terms of mean and variance .",
    "it can be argued that the need to exclude assets with potentially `` high '' payoffs from any analysis under quadratic utility ( whether via mv or eu methods ) is particularly bothersome , since that is when the decision - maker may feel most interest in the analysis . this is a problem for qu rather than for just the mv expression of qu .      if the class of returns distributions is restricted to a scale - location family with density @xmath179/b$ ] , given fixed @xmath180 but variable @xmath181 and @xmath182 , the decision - maker s expected utility will depend only on @xmath181 and  @xmath182 , and typically on @xmath46 and @xmath43 .",
    "this will lead to indifference curves in the @xmath45-plane .",
    "a popular special case is to consider only assets belonging to the class of normal distributions , @xmath183/\\sigma$ ] .",

    "it is important to understand how we have arrived at a case of parabolic indifference curves in apparent contradiction with the circles based on buridan .",
    "these different families of indifference curves emanate from different starting points . to get the buridan ( circular ) curves , we presume what is implicit under quadratic utility ",
    "specifically , that all available assets ( `` mixed '' or `` pure '' ) are represented sufficiently by just @xmath189 .",
    "similarly , to arrive at the normal - constant - risk - aversion ( parabolic ) indifference curves , we make a contrary and more restrictive assumption , namely , that all possible assets have normal distributions .",
    "derivation of indifference curves on the assumption of strictly normal distributions does not sit well with buridan s axiom .",
    "this class of distributions is not closed under probability mixing , since probability mixtures of normals are typically not normal .",
    "it is self - defeating , therefore , to arbitrarily limit the admissible asset class to just normal distributions , since mixture assets can always be constructed by randomization whether or not they arise naturally .    from a utility theory standpoint , this issue can be summed up as follows . if normal assets with parameters @xmath99 and @xmath190 have expected utilities @xmath191 and @xmath192 , then any probability mixture thereof , defined by @xmath20 , has expected utility @xmath193 .",
    "such calculations are elementary to expected utility theory , yet can not be captured or exhibited in any way using a set of indifference curves applicable to only normal distributions .",
    "the parameters of a nonnormal probability mixture , @xmath194 , are known but meaningless , since they can not be substituted into ( [ equ9 ] ) or any other measure of the expected utility of a normal distribution .",
    "they can , of course , be substituted into ( [ equ8 ] ) , but that would presume quadratic utility rather than normality .",
    "having first revealed that borch s paradox exploits a defect in qu rather than one in mv per se , @xcite went on to rationalize the use of mv indifference curves under the common presumption of only normal distributions .",
    "this further contribution , elaborating upon chipman [ ( @xcite ) , pages 179181 ] rests primarily on the assumption that assets are all highly divisible , thereby allowing investors to hold them in conventional linearly weighted portfolios with arbitrary positive weights ( e.g. , the investor can buy $ 3.121 worth of asset a and $ 6.879 worth of asset b in a $ 10 portfolio ) .",
    "linearly weighted portfolios have two helpful properties .",
    "first , as is well known , the class of jointly normal distributions is closed under linear combination .",
    "second , and essential to the chipman ",
    "baron argument , it follows from jensen s inequality that for any increasing and strictly concave ( risk averse ) utility function @xmath4 , the expected utility of an @xmath20-mixture of any two assets a and b is less than the expected utility of the corresponding @xmath20-weighted portfolio of the same two assets , @xmath195 .",
    "thus , even for risk averse utility functions that can not be represented in terms of solely @xmath45 , there is always a conventional weighted portfolio of a and b that dominates any probability mixture of a and b. probability mixtures can thus be ignored by any rational risk averse expected utility maximizer , provided of course that it is possible to combine the available pure assets into arbitrarily weighted portfolios .    by excluding all probability mixture assets , chipman and baron got around the problem that mixtures of normals are not normal , and thus made it feasible to work on the assumption that the asset class worthy of consideration includes only jointly normal distributions .",
    "this leaves the problem , of course , of how to choose between such normally distributed assets ( both the pure assets and theirweighted portfolios ) .    on this issue ,",
    "baron emphasized two points .",
    "first , the assumption that all assets are normal allows decision - makers with essentially any increasing utility function to draw @xmath45 indifference curves . for instance , a decision - maker with exponential utility has parabolic @xmath45 indifference curves .",
    "second , it is wrong to draw an arbitrary set of convex @xmath45 indifference curves and presume that they derive from some sensible risk averse utility function . to the contrary ,",
    "as occurs in borch s paradox , a set of apparently quite plausible looking indifference curves drawn on the basis of intuition , rather than being derived from an underlying utility function @xmath4 , will generally embody preferences between at least some definable assets that are obviously irrational .",
    "this second point , due initially to chipmanis not widely known .",
    "it is commonplace , especially in classroom and textbook contexts , to draw up any `` sensible looking '' usually convex @xmath45 indifference curves , as if the investor has free reign to take on any curves she likes .",
    "this fundamental misconception underlines why time can be well spent revisiting the analytical literature on mv versus eu from the borch era .",
    "the depth of this literature is exhibited in the way that chipman [ ( @xcite ) , page 169 ] was able to characterize the mv indifference curves from which an expected utility function can be recovered .",
    "specifically , chipman proved that when the choice is between only normal distributions , the utility function @xmath4 must be bounded over @xmath196 by the condition that @xmath197 , @xmath198 so as to ensure that the expected utility integral converges .",
    "given this growth constraint on @xmath4 , there exists an indifference function @xmath199 $ ] under the necessary and sufficient condition that @xmath48 satisfies the differential equation@xmath200      baron [ ( @xcite ) , page  1692 ] and liu [ ( @xcite ) , page 233 ] discuss how probability mixtures of different assets occur , explicitly or implicitly .",
    "for instance , the cash flows from a firm might have different probability distributions depending on a random event such as the outcome of a law suit , the reaction of competitors or a regulatory or political shift .",
    "there is no stock market for explicit mixtures of different individual stocks . indeed ,",
    "baron s argument suggests that there could be little if any rational demand for these . as an interesting aside",
    ", however , in some betting markets there is a commercially successful product called a `` mystery bet '' , where the buyer agrees to be allocated a random bet of agreed amount ( e.g. , a $ 10 bet on a random horse in a random race ) .",
    "a fully subjectivist view of real world stock market investment would suggest that much `` rational investment '' is tantamount to making `` mystery bets '' , in that there are so many random factors outside the control or observation of the investor that determine how the payoffs from her chosen investments are distributed . on this view , every discrete asset ( company stock ) in the stockmarket is in fact a mixture of distributions , and the investor has a subjective assessment of that stock s payoffs which amounts to a subjective mixture distribution of latent `` underlying stocks '' .",
    "the axioms of eu do not insist that the decision - maker should prefer more rather than less . to make this basic presumption of human behavior",
    ", the utility function @xmath4 must be a monotonically increasing function of the payoff @xmath5 .",
    "once this assumption is made of @xmath4 , it is possible to argue either on the grounds of utility theory or mere common sense that some distributions of payoffs strictly dominate others . to begin with , if one distribution @xmath201 is entirely to the right of another @xmath202 , then any investor who prefers more to less will favour @xmath201 .",
    "a  little less obviously , the same order of strict preference holds whenever the cumulative probability of any given outcome @xmath203 is higher under @xmath201 than under @xmath202 for all @xmath204 .",
    "specifically , @xmath205 is weakly preferred to @xmath206 whenever @xmath207 for all @xmath204 , where @xmath208 is the cumulative distribution function corresponding to probability density @xmath6 .",
    "this condition is known following @xcite as first order stochastic dominance ( fsd ) .",
    "its implication is that the expected utility of distribution @xmath201 exceeds the expected utility of distribution @xmath202 for all strictly increasing @xmath4 . @xcite",

    "this is known as second order stochastic dominance ( ssd ) .",
    "the conditions of stochastic dominance discovered by @xcite , and independently by @xcite , proceed by constraining not the class of asset distributions @xmath6 , but rather the class of decision - makers .",
    "decision - makers are categorized in effect by the pratt ",
    "arrow measure of absolute risk aversion @xmath212 , which is constant under positive linear transformations of @xmath4 and hence characterizes decision - makers uniquely [ i.e. , such that any two decision - makers with the same preferences have the same @xmath213 .",
    "fsd is an implicit dominance criterion for any decision - maker with increasing twice differentiable utility@xmath214 , whereas ssd is implicit in the decision criteria of any risk averse decision - maker @xmath215 .",

    "see levy ( @xcite ) for a comprehensive synthesis of the theory of stochastic dominance as a framework for decision - making under uncertainty .",
    "levy [ ( @xcite),chapter 3 ] shows that with normal distributions , ssd is equivalent to the mv criterion , and can be used as the axiomatic basis on which to derive it .",
    "@xcite made significant strides towards a general theory of ranking assets in order of stochastic dominance using only their moments .",
    "he proved , for example , that ( i ) first order stochastic dominance of asset a over asset b implies that @xmath216 , and ( ii ) second order stochastic dominance of asset a over asset b implies that @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "similar conditions involving higher moments follow necessarily under higher orders of stochastic dominance .",
    "these proofs have not led to a theory of ranking all assets via moments because the moment conditions are necessary but not sufficient to prove stochastic dominance at their respective levels . this has recently been emphasized by liu [ ( @xcite),pages  231 and 232 ] who gave a general proof that there is no specifiable set of moment conditions concerning the first @xmath219 moments of a and b that imply a first , second or third order dominance relationship between those two assets .",
    "essentially , while certain moment conditions are suggestive of certain orders of stochastic dominance , those conditions can still arise when their corresponding order of dominance does not obtain .",
    "@xcite employed the principle of fsd to rebut borch .",
    "they explained that the basic mistake in borch s logic is to treat the joint conditions that @xmath95 and @xmath220 as if these alone are sufficient for two assets @xmath99 and @xmath221 to be seen by someone as indifferent and positioned on the same indifference curve .",
    "their counterargument is that while @xmath91 and @xmath220 are necessary under risk aversion for indifference , these conditions are not sufficient .",
    "so much is proven by borch s own example , in which two specified assets meeting both conditions are obviously not indifferent .",
    "@xcite go on to reveal that one of the two assets in borch s example is fsd over the other . again",
    ", this is clear since one asset produces @xmath5 or @xmath53 with probability @xmath54 and the other produces @xmath5 or @xmath56 with the same probability , implying that if @xmath222 , for instance , then the cumulative distribution of asset  1 is weakly to the right of asset 2 .",
    "the levy and sarnat antidote to borch is thus to adopt a modified application of mv where in the first step the admissible asset class is immediately and efficiently reduced by removing all assets that are dominated under fsd ( and hence are not in the efficient set for _ any _ decision - maker with increasing utility ) .",
    "this two - stage procedure was first proposed in @xcite and later by @xcite and levy and sarnat ( @xcite ) , pages 315318 .",

    "it is `` normatively desirable and descriptively accurate '' .",

    "opinions are widely divided on whether expected utility is `` too normative '' to be practical or mean  variance is too `` practical '' to be respectable .",
    "the pragmatists perspective is summed up by economics nobel laureate james tobin [ ( @xcite ) , page 14 ] who suggested that a business practitioner will not be amused by the instruction that `` he should consult his utility and his subjective probabilities and then maximize '' .",
    "yet contrary of tobin s mockery , there is intensive theoretical and empirical study in current finance research devoted to practical investment portfolio selection by optimization of certain expected utility functions , both directly and by their expression through higher moments ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    a conciliatory note among the seminal contributors to the mv versus eu literature",
    "was struck by meyer ( @xcite ) , page 426 .",
    "he saw that mv offered a way of rewriting a subclass of expected utility that not only simplified the notions of risk and return , but which also revealed previously unrecognized relationships between the risks and returns of individual assets and their combinations in weighted portfolios .",
    "this gave rise to the new language of the `` efficient frontier '' and ultimately the `` capital asset pricing model '' .",
    "more fundamentally , it revealed very interesting and sometimes counterintuitive financial principles . in many instances",
    "these results can be transported back into eu theory and generalized to suit different possible utility functions .",
    "see , for example , the log utility capm applied in @xcite .",
    "this asset pricing equation is obtainable from first principles for any @xmath257 $ ] maximizing portfolio optimizer .",
    "such equations might have been discovered without being triggered by markowitz and the invention of the mean  variance capm , but more realistically the academic field of asset pricing was inspired by markowitz and the theory that arose in the era of borch and the swinging 60s .",
    "after completing this survey of borch s paradox , the authors learnt more of the status that borch retains in actuarial science from a fascinating biography by @xcite .",
    "the following passage from this biography confirms much of the impression we gained from the literature regarding borch and his intellectual influence over the mean  variance debate :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ there is a story about borch s stand on `` mean  variance '' analysis .",
    "this story is known to economists , but probably unknown to actuaries : he published a paper , `` a note on uncertainty and indifference curves '' in review of economic ( 1969 ) , and martin feldstein , a  friend of borch , published another paper in the same issue on the limitations of the mean  variance analysis for portfolio choice ( feldstein , @xcite ) . in the same issue a comment from james tobin appeared , `` comment on borch and feldstein '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "today borch s and feldstein s criticism seems well in place , but at the time this was shocking news .",
    "in particular , professor james tobin at yale , later a nobel laureate in economics , entertained at the time great plans for incorporating mean  variance analysis in macroeconomic modelling .",
    "there was even financing in place for an institute on a national level .",
    "however , after borch s and feldstein s papers were published , tobin s project seemed to have been abandoned .",
