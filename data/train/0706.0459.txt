    "<S> uk    the highest level of precision so far achieved for cross sections calculated in fixed - order perturbative qcd is next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections are known at nnlo for many processes involving incoming protons ( or antiprotons ) , i.e.  coefficient functions exist for deep - inelastic scattering @xcite , for hadro - production of electroweak particles such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons @xcite ( as a function of rapidity @xcite ) , and even higgs bosons @xcite ( in both the standard and supersymmetric models ) . </S>",
    "<S> the appropriate parton distributions to use with these hard cross sections are those which have been evolved using nnlo evolution kernels . </S>",
    "<S> approximations to these @xcite based on exact moments @xcite and small-@xmath1 limits @xcite have been available for a number of years , and correspondingly approximate nnlo parton distributions have been extracted from global fits @xcite , or fits to dis data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the complete calculation of the splitting functions was published in 2004 @xcite ( the results being numerically very similar to the previous estimates ) and this allowed improved nnlo parton distributions to be obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , some additional , sometimes unmentioned , approximations still exist in the published sets of nnlo partons .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most significant of these is the treatment of heavy flavour . at nnlo </S>",
    "<S> the partons become discontinuous at flavour transition points ( conventionally chosen to be at @xmath7 , with @xmath8 ) , due to the non - vanishing of transition matrix elements @xcite if the flavour number is allowed to vary . </S>",
    "<S> there is no reason why any parton should be exactly zero at a particular scale , and it is an accident of the @xmath9 renormalisation and factorisation scheme that the structure of the perturbative heavy flavour is so simple that one can evolve from zero at a given scale even at nlo . </S>",
    "<S> this is not true , for example , in the ms renormalisation scheme or even in the dis factorisation scheme ( an all orders heavy flavour prescription in this scheme is presented in @xcite ) where an @xmath1-dependent input at @xmath7 is required at nlo . </S>",
    "<S> these discontinuities in nnlo partons have so far been ignored , as explained in the appendices of @xcite . in principle </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to avoid this problem of discontinuities at the transition points by simply remaining in a fixed flavour number scheme . </S>",
    "<S> however , in practice the heavy flavour coefficient functions appropriate for this choice are only known to nlo so this is not an option . </S>",
    "<S> a complete nnlo set of partons must have a properly defined treatment of heavy flavour . </S>",
    "<S> none of the previous sets satisfy this requirement . </S>",
    "<S> also , the nnlo parton distributions should be obtained by a comparison to data using cross sections calculated at the same order .    </S>",
    "<S> these considerations make it necessary to update the nnlo parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the previous version , mrst2004 @xcite , there are two main changes in the theory : an implementation of a new variable flavour number scheme ( vfns ) for the heavy quark @xmath10 flavours @xcite ( based on the nlo schemes in @xcite and @xcite ) which maintains the continuity ( up to n@xmath11lo corrections which are very small ) of both neutral and charged current structure functions by introducing discontinuities in coefficient functions which counter those in the parton distributions ; and the inclusion of nnlo corrections @xcite to the drell  yan cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> the most important change compared to the previous nnlo partons , which already used the exact splitting functions @xcite , is the new vfns which leads to a significant change in the gluon and heavy quark distributions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , because we knew that the previous nnlo treatments were approximate , we did not provide uncertainties along with the central values . </S>",
    "<S> now that the nnlo procedure is essentially complete we rectify this . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the uncertainties due to the experimental errors on the data fitted , which is obtained using the hessian approach @xcite , is similar to that at nlo @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is more work to do in order to estimate the theoretical uncertainty , which is certainly important in some regions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> = 2.74 in    the procedure that we use to obtain the partons , and their uncertainties , is very similar to previous analyses , with the data used in the fit being essentially the same as in the mrst2004 analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we provide 15 different eigenvector sets of partons , with an `` up '' and `` down '' set for each . </S>",
    "<S> each of the 30 parton sets corresponds to a @xmath12 of 50 compared to the best fit , this corresponding to an approximate @xmath13 confidence - level for the uncertainty of the partons . by a factor of @xmath14 , because the increase in @xmath15 about the minimum is not completely quadratic for every eigenvector . ] </S>",
    "<S> these partons can be used to estimate the uncertainty of physical quantities in exactly the manner explained for the nlo partons in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the central values for the light quarks are similar to the previous nnlo analysis , though the evolution with @xmath16 is a little different in order to obtain the best fit with the different heavy flavour procedure . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the most marked change being at small @xmath1 and high @xmath16 , and we will return to this . at lower @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> it is most illuminating to instead examine the difference between the nnlo quarks and the quarks at nlo @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the change in the up quark distribution when going from nlo to nnlo is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . at small </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 the effect of the coefficient functions , particularly @xmath17 , is important and the difference between the nlo and the nnlo distribution is greater than the uncertainty in each . at large @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the coefficient functions are again important , i.e. @xmath18 and the difference between nlo and nnlo is again larger than the uncertainty in each as seen in fig .  [ fig1 ] . at small </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 the effect of the splitting functions is also important , particularly due to @xmath19 , which has a positive @xmath20 contribution . </S>",
    "<S> this affects the gluon distribution via the fit to @xmath21 , and the nnlo gluon is smaller at very low @xmath1 than the nlo gluon , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the major change in the partons comes about due to the improved treatment of the heavy quarks , @xmath8 . as before </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the heavy quark distributions are generated by perturbative evolution , i.e.  by @xmath22 transitions , where @xmath23 is the singlet light quark distribution . at nnlo , </S>",
    "<S> heavy flavour no longer evolves from zero at @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> rather the distributions , @xmath8 , have an input value given by the convolution @xmath24 where , in practice , the heavy flavour distribution starts from a negative value at low @xmath1 , since the main contribution is from the matrix element at small @xmath1 which is @xmath25 plus less singular contributions , and the singlet matrix element has the same small-@xmath1 behaviour up to a colour factor of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> these negative small-@xmath1 matrix elements are combined with the positive high- and moderate-@xmath1 parton distributions in the convolution to give negative heavy flavour contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting discontinuity at @xmath7 in the heavy flavour distributions is by no means insignificant , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuities make the use of a general - mass variable - flavour scheme essential , otherwise the structure functions would have sizable discontinuities at nnlo @xcite . , but there is little sensitivity to this choice since the @xmath27-dependent terms in the matrix elements account for evolution ( without a complete resummation , of course ) . if one made the transition at @xmath28 the input for the heavy partons would be smaller , although it would not be exactly zero anywhere . this would be more complicated to implement and the discontinuities in the other partons would change as well . ] alternatively , ignoring the discontinuities leads to large errors in the heavy flavour partons . </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuities in the light partons are much less significant , being at most a few percent for the gluon , the change quickly being overshadowed by evolution , and are very small indeed for light quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the increased evolution from the nnlo splitting function allows the nnlo charm distribution to catch up partially with respect to that at nlo , which starts from zero at @xmath29 , but it always lags a little behind at higher @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> ( similarly the correct nnlo charm distribution is smaller than the approximate mrst2004 nnlo distribution which turned on from zero . ) </S>",
    "<S> however , the added effect of the coefficient function at nnlo ( estimated at low @xmath16 in @xcite ) is to raise the nnlo value of @xmath30 above the nlo value . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of @xmath30 at nnlo compared to nlo is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the increase at low @xmath16 and the decrease which persists to high @xmath16 , means unambiguously that @xmath30 tends to be flatter in @xmath16 at nnlo than nlo . </S>",
    "<S> note that this comparison is made after a refit to data so that the corresponding evolution for light quarks must be such as to fit the hera inclusive data on @xmath31 . in detail </S>",
    "<S> this means that the light quarks at nnlo now actually need to evolve slightly more quickly than at nlo ( or than in the previous approximate nnlo treatment ) to make up for the decrease in the evolution for the heavy flavour . </S>",
    "<S> this correction in the charm procedure then automatically affects the gluon , since it has to compensate for the change in evolution of @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison with the low @xmath16 mrst2004 nnlo gluon is shown in the left of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] , while the right of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] shows the ratio after a long evolution length for both the gluon and the up quark ( the effect on the down quark being much the same ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the change in the gluon , and on the light quarks at very high @xmath16 , is greater than the uncertainty in some places . </S>",
    "<S> the correct heavy flavour treatment is vital .    </S>",
    "<S> our other theoretical improvement at nnlo is also non - trivial . </S>",
    "<S> the nnlo corrections to the drell  yan cross section are significant @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is an enhancement at high @xmath32 due to large logarithms , which is similar to the @xmath33 enhancement in structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo correction is large and the nnlo corrections are @xmath34 or more , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig7 ] . the quality of the fit to e866 drell  yan production @xcite in proton  proton collisions is @xmath35 at nlo and @xmath36 at nnlo . </S>",
    "<S> the scatter of points is large and a @xmath37 is approaching the best possible with a smooth distribution . the quality of the fit is good , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig8 ] . it is worse for proton  deuterium data . </S>",
    "<S> the positive correction at nnlo requires the data normalisation to be @xmath38 ( @xmath39 at nlo ) , there being little freedom since both the sea quarks for @xmath40 and the valence quarks are already well determined by structure function data . the normalisation uncertainty on the data is @xmath41 , and a change of @xmath42 is large but acceptable .    </S>",
    "<S> the one remaining set of data for which we can not use nnlo coefficient functions is the tevatron high-@xmath43 inclusive jet data @xcite , since the calculation is not complete . </S>",
    "<S> however , the systematic uncertainties on these data are of order @xmath34 , which is representative of the size of the nlo corrections , and indications @xcite are that the nnlo corrections are somewhat less than this ( the coupling being rather small at these very high scales , of course ) . </S>",
    "<S> whether one includes these data or not can lead to changes in the high-@xmath1 gluon of over @xmath44 , so a potential error of probably less than @xmath34 from using only the nlo coefficient functions seems trivial in comparison , and we keep these data in the fit .    the quality of the full fit for the set of data used is @xmath45 at nlo and @xmath46 at nnlo . </S>",
    "<S> the nnlo fit is consistently better than the nlo fit . </S>",
    "<S> there is most improvement in the description of the high-@xmath1 structure function data , where the nnlo coefficient function leads to a quicker evolution at low @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> most dis data sets , and the tevatron jet data , have a slightly better fit quality at nnlo . the exception is the e866 drell  yan data , as already noted . there is a tendency for the nnlo @xmath47 to increase with the improved theoretical treatment . </S>",
    "<S> an exactly analogous nlo fit yields @xmath48 , i.e.  much the same as in @xcite since the analysis is extremely similar . in comparison , at nnlo </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 , whereas in @xcite @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference can be traced mainly to the slowing of the heavy flavour evolution using the full treatment , leading to an increased coupling as well as a modified gluon distribution to compensate . </S>",
    "<S> overall , although the fit is generally good , particularly at nnlo , there is some room for improvement , and the data would prefer a little more gluon at both high and moderate @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> we examine the effect of the change in the nnlo partons on the predictions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 production at the lhc and the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> the results , compared to those using the nnlo partons of mrst2004 , are shown in table  [ tab1 ] , where we use @xmath51 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties on these cross sections are roughly @xmath53(expt . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results are largely unchanged for the tevatron cross sections , but there is an increase of @xmath42 in the lhc cross sections using the updated partons . </S>",
    "<S> this is not difficult to understand . </S>",
    "<S> we have already seen the difference in the gluon distribution in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the larger gluon in the region @xmath54 , and the larger coupling , are required to drive the evolution of the light quarks more quickly to match the small-@xmath1 hera data when the new procedure produces a flatter @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this results in the larger light quark distributions at high @xmath16 for @xmath55 , as seen in the right of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] , and a 6@xmath56 increase in the lhc cross sections , which are dominated by light quark  </S>",
    "<S> antiquark annihilation with @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the tevatron probes the distributions at @xmath58 resulting in little change in the predictions . </S>",
    "<S> ratios of heavy boson cross sections are also essentially unchanged . the 6@xmath56 change in the predictions of the @xmath59 rates at the lhc should not be regarded as an uncertainty  it is a consequence of correcting an over - simplified treatment of heavy flavours in previous nnlo analyses . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that this change is for different reasons than the recent change in predictions for vector boson cross sections at the lhc observed in going from the cteq6.1 to cteq6.5 parton distributions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter was for nlo partons and came about due to the implementation of a general - mass vfns instead of a zero - mass vfns . </S>",
    "<S> our change is due to an improvement in the general - mass vfns , the most important modification being the treatment of parton discontinuities , which is a feature which only appears at nnlo .    </S>",
    "<S> .total @xmath2 and @xmath3 cross sections multiplied by leptonic branching ratios at the tevatron and the lhc , calculated at nnlo using the updated nnlo parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions using the 2004 nnlo sets are shown in brackets.[tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we compare with the only other publicised nnlo partons available , those of alekhin @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have a much larger @xmath47 , i.e.  @xmath60 , as compared to @xmath61 and @xmath62 of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite at a given order , even for a given renormalisation scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the differences are formally of higher order , but may be significant at the level of @xmath63 or so for an extraction of @xmath47 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> different parton analyses tend to use different definitions . </S>",
    "<S> the details of our procedure can be found in @xcite with extension to nnlo . ] . there is not much difference in the high-@xmath1 valence quarks , except that explained by the difference in @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> there are differences in the low-@xmath1 sea quarks but these are dominated by differences in the flavour treatments of @xmath64 and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between our and alekhin s gluon distribution at small @xmath1 is seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig9 ] , and is much bigger than the uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the different heavy flavour treatments , which we do not believe to be consistent in @xcite , and which we have already shown to be important , as well as to differences in the data fitted and in the value of @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the gluons also differ a great deal at high @xmath1 , where , in our analysis , they are determined by the tevatron jet data @xcite ( the comparison now being excellent @xcite ) . in @xcite the gluon is unconstrained here , and should presumably have a large uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> in the @xmath9 scheme the gluon is more important for tevatron jets at high @xmath1 at nnlo than at nlo because the high-@xmath1 quarks are automatically significantly smaller , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have new theoretical corrections in our global analysis , and have obtained nnlo partons with uncertainties for the first time . these nnlo partons ( denoted mrst2006 ) </S>",
    "<S> can be found at http://durpdg.dur.ac.uk/hepdata/mrs , where , in order to have a precise treatment in the heavy quark transition region , there has been a major upgrade of the interpolation code , which now also allows a reliable extrapolation outside of the grid ( now defined for @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) for high @xmath16 and/or low @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the nnlo fit improves on that at nlo , as well as correcting our previous nnlo analysis . with respect to the latter , the value of @xmath47 at nnlo moves upwards significantly , and all partons change by a significant amount , particularly at small @xmath1 . as we have seen </S>",
    "<S> , this has implications for predictions for processes at the lhc .    for the future </S>",
    "<S> , there are more new data to be included : neutrino deep - inelastic scattering data from nutev @xcite and chorus @xcite , hera jets @xcite , updated tevatron high-@xmath43 jets @xcite , new cdf lepton - asymmetry data in different @xmath43 bins @xcite , new heavy flavour data from hera @xcite , and a full treatment of nutev dimuon data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there will also soon be averaged hera structure function data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this will lead us to produce fully updated nlo and nnlo partons for the lhc complete with uncertainties  both experimental and theoretical  in a relatively short timescale . </S>",
    "<S> however , until this major update can be finalised , the nnlo partons outlined in this note will serve as by far the most theoretically self - consistent , and most stringently constrained set currently available at nnlo . </S>"
