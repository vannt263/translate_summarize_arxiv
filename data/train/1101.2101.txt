    "over fifty years after anderson s seminal paper on localization  @xcite , the common wisdom is that in one dimension any disorder drives the phenomenon of anderson localization .",
    "even when the strength of disorder is arbitrarily small , all the eigenstates of the hamiltonian get exponentially localized . the same picture applies to a large extent to the two - dimensional case as well .    in a number of low - dimensional disordered systems the localization length @xmath4 is however known to diverge at special energies .",
    "this phenomenon is usually the manifestation of some symmetry .",
    "a well - known example is that of tight - binding models with off - diagonal disorder , both in one dimension  @xcite and on higher - dimensional bipartite lattices  @xcite . in this context",
    "the localization length becomes infinite at the center of the band ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is due to particle - hole symmetry ( @xmath6 ) . in the one - dimensional situation",
    ", it was already investigated in the pioneering work by dyson  @xcite on disordered harmonic chains , while the interest in two - dimensional models has been revived by a connection with the integer quantum hall effect  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to wonder what are the dynamical consequences of the divergence of the localization length at the band center in this class of models .",
    "the usual setting consists in looking at the spreading of the wave - packet of a particle initially launched at the origin .",
    "a variety of rigorous general results , following the pioneering work by guarneri  @xcite , relate the growth of the moments of the position of the particle to dimensions of the spectral measure .",
    "the latter results however have very little predictive power in the present situation .",
    "the goal of this work is to obtain quantitative , albeit non - rigorous dynamical results , which can be checked against numerical data .",
    "our main finding will be that the quantum motion exhibits a peculiar kind of anomalous diffusion which can be referred to as bi - fractality  @xcite .",
    "the disorder - averaged density profile @xmath7 of the particle at time @xmath8 becomes critical in the long - time regime , in the sense that it falls off as a power of distance , as @xmath9 . as a consequence ,",
    "the moments @xmath10 of the position of the particle diverge with time @xmath8 whenever @xmath0 exceeds  @xmath1 , while they have finite asymptotic values for @xmath11 . for the chain with off - diagonal disorder , investigated in section  2",
    ", we obtain @xmath2 .",
    "another example of interest is the random - dimer model  @xcite .",
    "this is a one - dimensional tight - binding model with diagonal binary disorder , so that the site energies @xmath12 assume the same values on dimers , i.e. , pairs of consecutive sites .",
    "the localization length is known to diverge at the special energies @xmath13 when @xmath14 , in units where the hopping amplitude is one .",
    "we demonstrate in section  3 that the dynamics of the random - dimer model fits within exactly the same framework , with @xmath3 .",
    "these findings confirm earlier heuristic results  @xcite , namely @xmath15 in the generic situation ( @xmath16 ) , while @xmath17 in the critical situation ( @xmath18 ) . in the first case ,",
    "our predictions are in agreement with recent rigorous results  @xcite .",
    "section  4 is devoted to a summary and discussion of our findings .",
    "we also argue why the same framework is expected to describe the quantum dynamics on two - dimensional bipartite lattices with off - diagonal disorder .",
    "in this section we investigate the time - dependent discrete schrdinger ( tight - binding ) equation on the one - dimensional chain with off - diagonal disorder : @xmath19 the hopping amplitudes @xmath20 between sites @xmath21 and @xmath22 are modelled as i.i.d .",
    "( independent and identically distributed ) random variables .",
    "we set differs from that used in  @xcite by a factor 4 . ]",
    "@xmath23      the time - independent ( spectral ) problem , defined by the eigenvalue equation @xmath24 has been the subject of much activity since the pioneering work of dyson  @xcite . the tight - binding equation  ( [ ses ] ) has the peculiar feature that the even and odd sub - lattices decouple at zero energy .",
    "hence the general solution at @xmath25 can be written down explicitly : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the following random walk ( discrete brownian motion ) associated with the disorder : @xmath28 the wavefunction  ( [ zeroe ] ) exhibits unusual scaling properties  @xcite .",
    "we have @xmath29 , and so the zero - energy wavefunction typically grows sub - exponentially as @xmath30 .",
    "in other words , the effective localization length grows with distance as @xmath31 so that in the thermodynamic limit , the localization length is infinite at zero energy .",
    "this peculiarity affects the behavior of various quantities near the band center .",
    "the lyapunov exponent @xmath32 at energy @xmath33 and the integrated density of states @xmath34 up to energy @xmath33 exhibit the following dyson singularities  @xcite as @xmath35 : @xmath36 the first result implies that the localization length @xmath37 exhibits a logarithmic divergence as energy @xmath33 approaches the band center , whereas the second one shows that states pile up near the band center , as the density of states strongly diverges as @xmath35  as @xmath38 this expression is at the verge of being non integrable .",
    "it will prove useful to first consider the finite - size scaling consequences of the dyson singularity . on a finite chain made of an even number @xmath39 of sites , with periodic boundary conditions",
    ", the spectrum manifests an exact particle - hole symmetry  @xcite : if @xmath40 is an eigenvector for the energy eigenvalue @xmath33 , then @xmath41 is an eigenvector for the opposite energy  @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore the expressions  ( [ zeroe ] ) show that @xmath25 can be an eigenvalue only if  @xmath39 is a multiple of 4 .",
    "this eigenvalue is then twofold degenerate .",
    "the condition on the disorder for this to occur is @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "we denote by @xmath45 the energy gap of a finite system , defined as the smallest positive energy eigenvalue .",
    "the form  ( [ dyson ] ) of the integrated density of states suggests to set @xmath46 .",
    "typical values of the latter quantity can be expected to be such that @xmath47 .",
    "we thus obtain the finite - size scaling law @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a fluctuating quantity of order unity .",
    "the eigenstates at energy @xmath50 are expected to be the most extended ones .",
    "the dyson singularity  ( [ dyson ] ) implies that their localization length scales as @xmath51 .",
    "this result is in agreement with the estimate  ( [ xieff ] ) of the effective distance - dependent localization length @xmath52 at zero energy , taken at the maximal distance @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ fx ] shows a plot of @xmath54 against @xmath55 .",
    "the energy gap @xmath45 is obtained by a numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian matrix on finite chains of @xmath39 sites , with periodic boundary conditions . only values of @xmath39 multiples of 4",
    "have been used .",
    "[ data for @xmath56 exhibit stronger corrections to the asymptotic linear behavior .",
    "this phenomenon can be related to the preceding observation that @xmath25 can only be an exact eigenvalue if @xmath39 is a multiple of 4 . ] in numerical simulations hereinafter , the @xmath57 are drawn uniformly in the interval @xmath58 , with @xmath59 .",
    "we shall report results for three values of the disorder strength : @xmath60 , 1 , and 2 .",
    "data are averaged over @xmath61 samples for each value of @xmath39 and @xmath62 .",
    "the observed linear behavior corroborates the scaling law  ( [ xfss ] ) .",
    "the slope of a common least - square fit to all datasets ( blue line ) yields @xmath63 .",
    "figure  [ fxhisto ] shows a histogram plot of the distribution of the reduced variable @xmath64 for the largest system considered , i.e. , @xmath65 .",
    "this distribution is observed to fall off very fast , both at small and large values of the variable , and to have a rather weak dependence on @xmath62 .",
    "let us now return to the quantum dynamics of the particle described by the time - dependent equation  ( [ se1d ] ) .",
    "we assume that the particle starts at the origin : @xmath66 our basic observables will be the moments of the position of the particle at time @xmath8 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the disorder - averaged density profile at time @xmath8 , whereas @xmath0 is an arbitrary positive index .",
    "hereinafter , the brackets @xmath69 denote an average over the quantum state at time  @xmath8 described by the wavefunction @xmath70 , whereas the bar @xmath71 denotes an ensemble average over the disorder , i.e. , over the distribution of the random hopping amplitudes  @xmath72 .    on a finite sample made of @xmath39 sites ,",
    "the moments @xmath73 can be expressed in terms of the @xmath39 energy eigenvalues @xmath74 and of the corresponding ( real and normalized ) eigenvectors @xmath75 .",
    "expanding the initial condition as @xmath76 we find the wavefunction at arbitrary time @xmath77 : @xmath78 combining  ( [ sum0 ] ) and  ( [ psit ] ) , we arrive at @xmath79    the long - time behavior of the above exact expression can be analyzed in the following heuristic way , along the line of thought of  @xcite .",
    "first , neglecting interference terms between different quantum states , we obtain @xmath80 second , we model the eigenstates by considering that the probability density @xmath81 is roughly uniform over the range @xmath82 , where we have introduced the center - of - mass co - ordinate @xmath83 and the localization length @xmath84 of eigenstate @xmath85 , defined as @xmath86 this picture implies that the eigenstates which contribute to the sum  ( [ sum2 ] ) are those such that @xmath87 . putting everything together , we are left with the following asymptotic long - time estimate for the disorder - averaged moments : @xmath88 finally , for a large system , the sum over discrete states can be replaced by an integral over the spectrum : @xmath89    in the customary situation of the anderson model with diagonal disorder , the moments of the position are thus predicted to saturate to finite limiting values of order @xmath90 , where for definiteness @xmath91 is the localization length at the band center .",
    "more quantitative predictions can be worked out , including universal pre - factors in the weak - disorder regime  @xcite .",
    "the present situation of the anderson model with off - diagonal disorder is radically different .",
    "indeed , the dyson singularities  ( [ dyson ] ) which affect the localization length and the density of states near the band center cause the integral in  ( [ mt ] ) to diverges for sufficiently large @xmath0 . more precisely , taking @xmath92 as independent variable , the expressions  ( [ dyson ] ) yield @xmath93 and @xmath94 , and so  ( [ mt ] ) reads @xmath95 the integral is divergent for @xmath96 .    let us first consider the stationary regime of very long times , and focus onto the integrand in  ( [ mdyson ] ) , not paying attention to the integration bounds for the time being .",
    "it is natural to identify the integration variable @xmath97 with the position @xmath98 of the particle , according to @xmath99 .",
    "we can thus read off from  ( [ mdyson ] ) that the asymptotic disorder - averaged density profile reached by the particle in the long - time regime , @xmath100 falls off as the power law @xmath101    let us move to the late stages of the dynamics of the quantum particle . as the latter starts from the origin , its wavefunction spreads progressively over larger and larger distances . for a large but finite time @xmath8 , the power - law density profile  ( [ rho ] ) is therefore expected to be cutoff at some scale @xmath102 .",
    "the growth law of the crossover scale @xmath102 can be estimated as follows .",
    "first , as a consequence of the uncertainty principle , the finiteness of the observation time @xmath8 induces a finite energy resolution @xmath103 .",
    "the largest observable localization length at time @xmath8 therefore scales as the localization length at energy @xmath104 near the band center .",
    "hence it diverges as @xmath105 .",
    "then , the cutoff scale @xmath102 can be estimated by equating the above @xmath106 to the effective localization length @xmath52 of  ( [ xieff ] ) .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath107    the crossover scale @xmath102 provides the appropriate cutoff to the integral in  ( [ mdyson ] ) .",
    "the disorder - averaged moments @xmath108 of the position can now be evaluated by means of the estimates  ( [ rho ] ) and  ( [ nstar ] ) .",
    "we are thus left with the prediction that the moments grow with time on a logarithmic scale for @xmath109 , whereas they saturate to finite values for @xmath110 : @xmath111 we have in particular @xmath112    the above analysis has been tested against numerical data generated by directly simulating the time - dependent tight - binding equation  ( [ se1d ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fprofil ] shows a log - log plot of the disorder - averaged density @xmath7 against time @xmath8 , for @xmath60 and even distances  @xmath21 ranging from 0 to 12 .",
    "the convergence to asymptotic densities  @xmath113 is observed to be slower and slower for larger distances . for each distance @xmath21 , a black symbol marks the crossover time @xmath114 , defined operationally as the time where @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the oscillations which can be seen in @xmath117 , and to some extent in  @xmath118 , are reminiscent of those which are present in the absence of disorder , where the time - dependent wavefunction reads @xmath119 , with @xmath120 being the bessel functions .",
    "we mention for further reference that the latter wavefunction exhibits ballistic peaks around the positions @xmath121 , whose width and height respectively scale as @xmath122 and  @xmath123 .",
    "more precisely , setting @xmath124 , one finds  @xcite @xmath125 with @xmath126 being the airy function .",
    "figure  [ fp ] shows a log - log plot of  @xmath127 times the asymptotic densities @xmath113 , against distance @xmath21 .",
    "the data corroborate the prediction  ( [ rho ] ) , shown by the blue line with slope @xmath128 .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath129 law may have some weak residual dependence on @xmath62 , besides the main scaling in @xmath130 .",
    "the corrections to the asymptotic behavior are observed to be larger at weaker disorder .",
    "figure  [ ft ] shows a plot of @xmath131 against @xmath132 , where the crossover time @xmath114 has been defined by the condition @xmath115 , as said above . this plot is a dynamical analogue of figure  [ fx ] , where the system size @xmath39 is replaced by the distance @xmath21 traveled by the particle , whereas time @xmath8 replaces the inverse of the energy gap @xmath45 .",
    "it is clearly far more difficult to get accurate dynamical data than spectral ones of the same quality . in spite of this , and although the available data span a rather limited range , they however point toward an asymptotic linear growth , whose slope is nearly independent of disorder .",
    "these observations support the prediction  ( [ nstar ] ) , again up to a possible weak residual dependence on @xmath62 .",
    "the slope of the blue line has been chosen for definiteness to be the same as that of figure  [ fx ] .",
    "figure  [ fmom34 ] shows plots of @xmath133 ( left ) and @xmath134 ( right ) , against @xmath135 .",
    "the data exhibit linear growth laws , whose slopes seem independent of @xmath62 , at least to a good approximation , thus corroborating  ( [ m34 ] ) .",
    "the slopes of common least - square fits yield @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "figure  [ fmom2 ] shows a plot of @xmath138 against @xmath139 .",
    "this quantity is predicted in  ( [ mq ] ) to grow logarithmically , with an amplitude independent of the disorder strength  @xmath62 .",
    "the available data can not lead to a firm conclusion in this marginal situation .",
    "they however show a trend toward the predicted behavior , shown by the blue line ( up to an unknown multiplicative factor ) .",
    "the estimate  ( [ nstar ] ) of the dynamical crossover scale @xmath102 provides the opportunity of putting the present problem in perspective with the sinai walk  @xcite , namely the diffusion of a classical particle in a one - dimensional quenched random potential @xmath140 , modeled as a brownian motion such that @xmath141 .",
    "the sinai particle is known to have a very slow anomalous motion , such that @xmath142 .",
    "this estimate bears a striking resemblance with our crossover scale @xmath102 .",
    "both models are indeed known to share a certain number of common features  @xcite .",
    "the different behaviors of the moments @xmath108 for @xmath11 and @xmath143 emphasized in  ( [ mq ] ) ( with @xmath2 ) can be referred to as _ bi - fractality_. this word was already used in the framework of a free quantum particle described by a tight - binding model in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , the moments of the position of the particle exhibit ballistic scaling , i.e. , @xmath144 for all positive @xmath0 .",
    "the moments of the probability density however exhibit a non - trivial scaling : @xmath145 this behavior is due to the ballistic peaks of the wavefunction @xmath70 around @xmath146 [ see  ( [ psiairy ] ) ] .",
    "these peaks bring negligible ( resp .  dominating ) contributions for @xmath110 ( resp .",
    "@xmath96 ) . the word _",
    "bi - fractal _ had already appeared in the context of the distribution of matter in the universe  @xcite .",
    "coming back to our findings , the main consequence of the divergence of the localization length at the band center turns out to be the critical nature of the asymptotic density profile of the particle in the long - time regime , which falls off as a power of distance , as @xmath147 . as long as we probe a moment @xmath108 with @xmath11 ,",
    "the fat power - law tail of the latter profile is irrelevant , and so @xmath108 remains finite .",
    "the marginal moment ( @xmath148 ) slowly diverges with time , as the logarithm of the cutoff scale @xmath102 . for @xmath143 ,",
    "the divergence of the localization length is somewhat faster , as @xmath149 .",
    "finally , there is a qualitative difference between the kind of anomalous diffusion implied by the bi - fractal behavior met in the present work [ see  ( [ mq ] ) ,  ( [ mqdim ] ) ,  ( [ mqdim1 ] ) ] and conventional anomalous diffusion . the latter phenomenon is usually characterized by a single growing length scale  @xmath150 , so that @xmath151 for all positive @xmath0 . in the case of self - similar growth ,",
    "like e.g.  in fractional diffusion , one has @xmath152 , and so @xmath153 for all positive @xmath0  [ see  @xcite and the references therein ] .",
    "we now turn to another example of a one - dimensional tight - binding model with unusual localization properties , namely the random - dimer model  @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation reads @xmath154 where the site energies @xmath20 follow a sequence of dimers , i.e. , they take random values on _ pairs _ of consecutive sites . in other words , @xmath155 where @xmath156 takes values @xmath157 and @xmath158 with equal probabilities , and @xmath159 for definiteness .",
    "the time - independent problem is defined by the eigenvalue equation @xmath160 it was shown first by dunlap _ et  al _  @xcite that the random - dimer model exhibits a transparency phenomenon at @xmath13 , and extended states near these special energies for @xmath14 .",
    "this phenomenon is best described in terms of transfer matrices .",
    "the tight - binding equation  ( [ rds ] ) can be recast as @xmath161    the generic localization properties of the customary anderson model with diagonal disorder , where the site energies @xmath20 are i.i.d .",

    "owing to symmetry it is sufficient to consider the case @xmath166 .",
    "we have then @xmath167 so that adding a dimer with @xmath168 amounts to changing the sign of the wavefunction .",
    "the system therefore supports extended states at ( and near ) @xmath166 , provided this energy lies in the spectrum of the other species of dimers ( @xmath169 ) . for the sites belonging to the latter dimers ,  ( [ rds ] ) reads @xmath170 for @xmath166 , the dispersion law of the latter equation reads @xmath171 .",
    "the condition for having extended states therefore reads @xmath14 .",

    "+ neglecting localization effects in the immediate vicinity of the special energy , the dispersion law of  ( [ other ] ) reads @xmath173 . as a consequence",
    ", the dynamics of the effectively extended states is characterized by the ballistic ( group ) velocity @xmath174 * in the _ critical situation _ ( @xmath18 ) , the special energy @xmath175 meets the band edge of  ( [ other ] ) , and so the velocity @xmath176 vanishes .",
    "the properties of the spectrum are very asymmetric in the vicinity of the special energy .",
    "the localization length and the density of states respectively diverge as @xmath177 whereas the density of states is exponentially small as @xmath178 .",
    "consider now , along the lines of section  2 , a finite sample made of an even number  @xmath39 of sites , covered by @xmath179 dimers .",
    "the number of eigenstates which are effectively extended grows as @xmath55 , both in the generic and in the critical situation  @xcite . in the generic situation ( @xmath16 ) , the eigenstates such that the difference @xmath180 is smaller than @xmath181 have a localization length @xmath182 larger than @xmath39 . as the density of states is finite at @xmath166 , the number of such effectively extended states grows as @xmath183 .",

    "the very good quality of the observed data collapse , especially for the larger values of the ratio @xmath224 , strongly supports the scaling law  ( [ rhosca1 ] ) derived by heuristic means .    as a consequence of  ( [ rhosca1 ] ) ,",

    ", the most extended eigenstate has an effective localization length of the order of @xmath230 .",
    "the system therefore supports no effectively extended state . on the contrary , in the random - dimer model ( section  3 ) ,",
    "the localization length has a strong power - law divergence as @xmath231 .",
    "a large but finite sample now supports a large number of effectively extended states , growing as @xmath55 .",
    "this difference probably explains why the study of the random - dimer model is far easier than that of the chain with off - diagonal disorder , both from the mathematical and the numerical standpoints .",
    "the main features of the quantum dynamics put forward in this work are nevertheless very similar in both models :    * the disorder - averaged densities @xmath232 converge to non - trivial asymptotic values  @xmath113 , which fall off at large distances as a power law of the form @xmath233 [ see  ( [ rho ] ) ,  ( [ rhodim ] ) ] . * for a large but finite observation time , the power - law density profile is cutoff at some spatial scale @xmath102 which keeps growing with time . *",

    "the anomalous spreading and the existence of a non - trivial limiting profile are demonstrated to be due to the divergence of the localization length of the phonon modes at low frequency .",
