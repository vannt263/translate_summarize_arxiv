    "one of the main goals of the current experiments at rhic and sps and forthcoming experiments at fair and nica facilities is to determine a kind of the deconfinement transition in dense baryonic matter and to find the collision energy ( thereby the baryonic density ) at which this transition starts . in this paper",
    "it is argued that the baryon stopping in nuclear collisions can be a sensitive probe of the deconfinement onset .",
    "let us start with discussion in terms of the conventional ( i.e. one - fluid ) hydrodynamics .",
    "the form of the resulting rapidity distribution of net - baryons depends on the spatial form of the produced fireball .",
    "if the fireball is almost spherical , the expansion of the fireball is essentially 3-dimensional which results in a peak at the midrapidity in the rapidity distribution .",
    "this statement is a theorem that can be proved in few lines .",
    "if a the fireball is strongly deformed ( compressed ) in the beam direction , i.e. has a form of a disk , its expansion is approximately 1-dimensional that produces a dip at the midrapidity , which is confirmed by numerous simulations , see e.g. @xcite . in terms of the fluid mechanics",
    "this is a consequence of interaction of two rarefaction waves propagating from opposite peripheral sides of decaying disk toward its center @xcite .",
    "the formation of this fireball is already a matter of dynamics at the early compression stage of the nuclear collision .",
    "a softest point @xcite characteristic of eos s with a phase transition plays an important role in this compression dynamics . at the softest point",
    "the system exhibits the weakest resistance to its compression as compared with that in adjacent regions of the eos . at low collision energies the softest point",
    "is not reached in the collision process , the system remains stiff and therefore the produced fireball is almost spherical . as a result",
    ", the baryon rapidity distribution is peaked at the midrapidity .",
    "when the incident energy gets high enough , the softest - point region of the eos starts to dominate during the compression stage , the system weaker resists to the compression and hence the resulting fireball becomes more deformed , i.e. more of the disk shape .",
    "then its expansion is close to the 1-dimensional pattern and , as a result , we have a dip at the midrapidity . with energy rise",
    ", the stiffness of the eos ( in the range relevant to compression stage ) grows , the system stats to be more resistant to the compression and hence the produced fireball becomes less deformed .",
    "the expansion of this fireball results in a peak or , at least , to a weaker dip at the midrapidity as compared to that at the `` softest - point '' incident energy . with further energy rise ,",
    "the initial kinetic pressure overcomes the stiffness of the eos and makes the produced fireball strongly deformed again , which in its turn again results in a dip at the midrapidity .",
    "thus , even without any nonequilibrium , we can expect a kind of a `` peak - dip - peak - dip '' irregularity in the incident energy dependence of the form of the net - proton rapidity distributions .",
    "nonequilibrium also contributes to this irregularity . at a phase transformation",
    "the hadronic degrees of freedom are changed to partonic ones .",
    "in particular , the dip at the midrapidity in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions occurs because the baryon charges of colliding nuclei traverse through each other rather than results from the 1-dimensional expansion of a disk - like fireball .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the `` peak - dip - peak - dip '' irregularity is a signal from the hot and dense stage of the nuclear collision .    in the present paper this qualitative pattern",
    "is illustrated by calculations within a model of the three - fluid dynamics ( 3fd ) @xcite employing three different equations of state ( eos ) : a purely hadronic eos @xcite ( hadr .",
    "eos ) and two versions of eos involving deconfinement @xcite : an eos with the first - order phase transition ( 2-phase eos ) and that with a smooth crossover transition ( crossover eos ) .",
    "the softest points in these eos s are illustrated in ref .",
    "the hadronic eos @xcite possesses no softest point , i.e. stiffness of the eos changes monotonously .",
    "results on the stopping power were reported in refs .",
    "@xcite in more ditail .",
    "a direct measure of the baryon stopping is the net - baryon ( i.e. baryons - minus - antibaryons ) rapidity distribution .",
    "however , since experimental information on neutrons is unavailable , we have to rely on net - proton ( i.e. proton - minus - antiproton ) data .",
    "presently there exist experimental data on proton ( or net - proton ) rapidity spectra at ags @xcite and sps @xcite energies .",
    "figure [ fig4.1 ] presents calculated rapidity distributions of net - protons in central collisions at ags and sps energies and their comparison with available data .",
    "difference between protons and net - protons is negligible at the ags energies . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4.1 ] , the distributions within the first - order - transition scenario indeed exhibit the above - discussed `` peak - dip - peak - dip '' irregularity in contrast to results obtained within the purely hadronic and crossover scenarios .",
    "the experimental distributions exhibit a qualitatively similar behavior as that in the 2-phase - eos scenario",
    ". however , quantitatively the 2-phase - eos results certainly disagree with data in the energy region 8@xmath0 gev @xmath1 40@xmath0 gev .",
    "midrapidity reduced curvature [ see .",
    "( [ cy ] ) ] of the ( net)proton rapidity spectrum as a function of the center - of - mass energy of colliding nuclei as deduced from experimental data and predicted by 3fd calculations with different eos s : the hadronic eos ( hadr .",
    "eos ) @xcite ( left panel ) , the eos involving a first - order phase transition ( 2-ph .",
    "eos , middle panel ) and the eos with a crossover transition ( crossover eos , right panel ) into the quark - gluon phase @xcite .",
    "upper bounds of the shaded areas correspond to fits confined in the region of @xmath2 , lower bounds , @xmath3 .",
    ", width=419 ]    in order to quantify the above - discussed `` peak - dip - peak - dip '' irregularity , it is useful to make use of the method proposed in ref .  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "the data on the net - proton rapidity distributions are fitted by the following simple formula @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are parameters of the fit . the form ( [ 2-sources - fit ] ) is a sum of two thermal sources shifted by @xmath8 from the midrapidity which is put to be @xmath9 as it is in the collider mode",
    ". the parameters of the two sources are identical ( up to the sign of @xmath6 ) because only collisions of identical nuclei are considered .",
    "the above fit has been done by the least - squares method and applied to both available data and results of calculations .",
    "a useful quantity , which characterizes the shape of the rapidity distribution , is a reduced curvature of the spectrum at midrapidity defined as follows @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the beam rapidity in the collider mode .",
    "the second part of eq .",
    "( [ cy ] ) presents this curvature in terms of parameters of fit ( [ 2-sources - fit ] ) .",
    "excitation functions of @xmath12 deduced both from experimental data and from results of the 3fd calculations with different eos s are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4a ] . to evaluate errors of the @xmath12 values deduced from data , errors produced by the least - squares method were estimated . the uncertainty associated with the choice of the rapidity range turned out to be the dominant one for the @xmath12 quantities deduced from simulation results .",
    "therefore , in fig .  [ fig4a ] results for the curvature @xmath12 are presented by shaded areas with borders corresponding to the fit ranges @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    the irregularity in data is distinctly seen here as a wiggle irregularity in the energy dependence of @xmath12 .",
    "of course , this is only a hint to irregularity since this wiggle is formed only due to preliminary data of the na49 collaboration .",
    "a remarkable observation is that the @xmath12 excitation function in the first - order - transition scenario manifests qualitatively the same wiggle irregularity ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4a ] ) as that in the data fit , while the hadronic scenario produces purely monotonous behavior .",
    "the crossover eos represents a very smooth transition , therefore , it is not surprising that it produces only a weak wiggle in @xmath12 .",
    "in conclusion , the irregularity in the baryon stopping is a natural consequence of deconfinement occurring at the compression stage of a nuclear collision and thus is a signal from the hot and dense stage of the nuclear collision .",
    "it is an effect of the softest point of a eos . as it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this irregularity is a very robust signal of a first - order phase transition that survives even under conditions of a very limited acceptance .",
    "updated experimental results are badly needed to analyze a trend of the `` peak - dip - peak - dip '' irregularity .",
    "it would be highly desirable if new data are taken within the same experimental setup .",
