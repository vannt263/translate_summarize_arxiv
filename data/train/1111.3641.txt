    "there is no direct evidence of the handedness of the coupling in the massive gluon models .",
    "the d0 result could be interpreted as an indirect clue for the chiral couplings of the massive gluon .",

    "the deviation of the top quark forward - backward asymmetry @xmath17 from its sm prediction may indicate the presence of new physics .",

    "indeed , the d0 collaboration reports @xmath151 , about @xmath152 away above the sm value . in this paper",
    ", we study the kinematic and dynamic aspects of the relationship between the asymmetries @xmath17 and @xmath23 based on the spin correlation between charged leptons and the top quark with different polarization states . owing to the spin correlation in top quark decay , @xmath23 and @xmath17",

    "top quarks , the nature of the correlation depends on how boosted the top quark is . for large enough top quark energy",
    ", left - handed top quarks will also generate a large charged - lepton asymmetry , similar to that for right - handed quarks .",
    "however , if the top quark is not boosted ( @xmath153 gev ) , @xmath23 from left - handed top quarks will be less than @xmath154 for a positive @xmath17 .",
    "since most of the @xmath69 events are produced in the threshold region , one may use the large positive values of @xmath17 and @xmath23 measured at d0 to conclude that production of left - handed top quarks is disfavored .",
    "confirmation of the d0 result and greater statistics are desirable .",
    "there is great value in making measurements of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 because their correlation can be related through top quark polarization to the underlying dynamics of top quark production .",
    "we focus on two benchmark np models , an axigluon ( @xmath100 ) model which produces unpolarized top quarks , i.e. an equal number of right - handed and left - handed top quarks , and a flavor - changing @xmath2 model which produced dominantly right - handed top quarks . to determine free parameters , we require that these new physics models fit @xmath17 as well as the @xmath14 total cross section at the tevatron at @xmath133 level of accuracy .",
    "as we show , there is a strong correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath23 in both models .",
    "the best fit to the relationship is @xmath155 and @xmath156 , for the axigluon model and the @xmath2 model , respectively , both within @xmath3 of the d0 result . to generate @xmath23 satisfying the data to better than @xmath133 accuracy ,",

    "we do not address the lhc case in this paper but may do so at a later time .",
