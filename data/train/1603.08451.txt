    "single - photon sources are critical resources for quantum - enhanced technologies , such as quantum metrology @xcite , quantum communications @xcite , and photonic quantum computation @xcite .",
    "heralded single - photon sources ( hspss ) , first demonstrated by hong and mandel @xcite in 1986 , have been of great interest in quantum information applications .",
    "heralded single photons may be created by a photon - pair producing nonlinear optical process such as spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc ) or spontaneous four - wave mixing ( sfwm ) ; a single photon s presence is `` heralded '' by the detection of its twin photon . although hspss are not on - demand sources due to the probabilistic nature of the pair generation process , they are easier to design and implement compared to single emitter sources @xcite such as single atoms , ions , and semiconductor devices , which typically require vacuum and/or cryogenic systems . moreover , it is possible to improve a hsps to be pseudo - on - demand by using temporal or spatial multiplexing techniques @xcite .    in the context of quantum information applications , there are essentially three key metrics for an hsps : indistinguishability , heralding efficiency , and source brightness .",
    "indistinguishable photons , i.e. , pure and identical photons , are desirable because they can exhibit multi - photon interference @xcite that is central to many quantum information applications . in order to permit heralding of pure single photons , the spdc or sfwm",
    "two - photon state source must be factorable .",
    "heralding efficiency , the probability of a single - photon state , conditional on a heralding detector signal , corresponds to the purity of a heralded state in the photon - number basis , and thus is a very important factor to scale up quantum information protocols .",
    "lastly , source brightness is often characterized as the photon generation rate per unit pump power ( e.g. , cps / mw ) .",
    "a bright source can relax pump power requirements , and lead , e.g. , to higher success probability for multi - photon protocols .",
    "it is a challenging task to optimize these three metrics simultaneously , as there are usually trade - offs between them .",
    "for example , a typical spdc source does not generate spectrally factorable photon pairs and requires narrowband spectral filtering for high purity and indistinguishability .",
    "however , the spectral filtering significantly reduces source brightness and heralding efficiency .    in order to realize a practical high - quality hsps , several experiments @xcite have demonstrated highly nondegenerate spdc . for high brightness of heralded single photons , it is important to use not only a highly efficient spdc source but also efficient trigger detectors . in this sense , it is advantageous to generate trigger photons within the range of the high sensitivity wavelength ( 600 - 800 nm ) for off - the - shelf , efficient si avalanche photodiodes ( si - apds ) . on the other hand , for high total system heralding efficiency",
    ", it is preferable to generate photons in the telecommunication band for lower - loss propagation through optical fibers .",
    "thus , such nondegenerate spdc is useful to achieve high brightness and heralding efficiency in practice .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , until now there has been no source based on highly nondegenerate spdc that simultaneously achieved high purity , due to the presence of strong spectral correlations between the photons .",
    "here we propose and demonstrate an hsps based on highly nondegenerate , spectrally factorable spdc which can simultaneously attain high purity , high heralding efficiency , and a moderately high brightness .",
    "a group velocity matching ( gvm ) condition in a periodically - poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) crystal allows us to produce intrinsically factorable photon pairs at @xmath1800 nm and @xmath11590 nm , which is in the telecommunication l - band .",
    "our spectrally factorable spdc source can generate pure heralded single photons without the narrowband filtering which typically reduces the brightness and heralding efficiency .",
    "we characterize the purity of the heralded single photons using several techniques , which consistently reveal high state purity .",

    "although many nondegenerate spdc sources utilizing the highest @xmath62 nonlinear susceptibility have significantly higher brightness @xcite , those need narrowband spectral filtering to attain state purity , which also significantly reduces brightness and heralding efficiency .",
    "in order to characterize the heralded single - photon purity , we performed three different measurements .",
    "first , in order to map the jsi , i.e. , @xmath63 of our spdc source , we used a frequency - resolved optical parametric amplification ( opa ) technique @xcite ( see fig . [ setup ] ( a , b ) ) . for this measurement ,",
    "in addition to the pump laser for the spdc process , we used a laser diode ( ld ) whose wavelength is stabilized ( linewidth @xmath64 20 mhz ) and tunable around the idler central wavelength . the wavelength - stabilized beam is coupled to the collection smf for the idler mode , propagating backwards along the optical path of the idler photons .",
    "the backward propagating beam is reflected by a curved mirror and subsequently focused into the ppktp crystal to seed the opa process ; the corresponding signal spectral mode in the jsi is then amplified .",
    "in other words , only the `` cross - section '' of the jsi at the idler seed wavelength is amplified .",
    "thus , the jsi can be reconstructed by measuring the change of the amplified signal spectrum as the seed wavelength is scanned . with our 1-mw seed power ,",
    "the amplification gain over the spdc process is approximately @xmath65 , which is sufficient so as to observe the amplified signal spectra by a standard ccd - based spectrometer .",
    "compared to the methods relying on coincidence detection of spdc photon pairs , this opa - based measurement provides a result much faster and with a higher spectral resolution as determined by the tuning resolution of the seed laser and the spectrometer s resolution .",
    "figures [ jsi ] ( a - c ) show experimentally reconstructed jsis for different pump bandwidths ; using second - harmonic generation lbo crystals with lengths of 3 , 7 , and 15 mm , we obtained spectral fwhm bandwidths of 4.1 , 2.1 , and 1.0 nm , respectively . the spectral resolution in the jsi measurement",
    "is 0.1 nm for both spdc modes .",
    "we find that while signal - mode bandwidth varies according to the pump bandwidth , that of the idler mode remains approximately unchanged .",

    "[ predictions ] ( b - d ) ) for @xmath36 because of slightly mismatched group velocities of the pump and signal mode ( @xmath56 ) , it is much higher than other sources using nondegenerate spdc . the slightly shifted signal central wavelengths for the different pump bandwidths were due to a temperature change in the lbo crystals ( with the tuning sensitivity of @xmath10.7 nm / c@xmath67 around 173 c@xmath67 ) .",
    "we also found that the spdc central wavelengths are insensitive to the temperature change in the ppktp crystal ( @xmath68 nm / c@xmath67 for the signal mode from 30 to 100 c@xmath67 ) ; the refractive - index changes of the three spdc modes are well cancelled to maintain the phase - matching condition .",
    "the frequency - resolved opa can reveal very precise spectral intensity correlations .",
    "however , it can not extract `` amplitude '' correlations including spectral phase , because the opa is a phase - insensitive amplifier for the vacuum field of the signal mode . in order to more directly estimate the purity without the spectral - phase assumption , we observed the second - order auto - correlation function at zero time delay @xmath69 for each spdc mode .",

    "[ homi ] ( b ) ) .",
    "a longer time of data accumulation was used for the homi measurement involving two signal photons because of less efficient smf coupling after the delay line . by using a gaussian fit ( see appendix a ) , the interference visibility and the dip width are estimated to be @xmath90% ( after subtracting 1.7 background counts ) and @xmath91 ps , respectively . although high and similar visibilities are observed for both measurements , as expected from the reconstructed jsi ( see fig .",

    "perfect gvm is satisfied by producing signal and idler photons at 762 and 1647 nm , respectively .",
    "however , it is challenging to characterize photons with wavelengths greater than 1600 nm , for which standard apds are not sensitive ; however , superconducting single - photon detectors tuned for this wavelength may be a viable option . through numerical simulations , we found that eliminating the peripheral lobes of the phase - matching function for our current spdc source can enhance the purity up to 94% ; modulating poling periods in a ktp crystal can lead to a phasematching function without peripheral sidelobes , e.g. a gaussian function , instead of the typical sinc - function dependence which does present sidelobes @xcite .",
