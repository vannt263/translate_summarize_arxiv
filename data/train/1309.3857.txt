    "optically thick pair plasma with baryon loading is assumed to power grbs in many models considered in the literature , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such plasma is self accelerated to large bulk lorentz factors due to initial energy dominance . due to relativistic kinematics in laboratory reference",
    "frame it forms a shell with width approximately equal to its initial size .",
    "when the plasma becomes transparent to compton scattering a flash of radiation is emitted . in the literature such emission is often associated with so - called precursors @xcite . in the fireshell model @xcite this emission",
    "is called the proper grb ( p - grb ) .    for typical baryonic loading parameters of observed grbs @xmath3 , where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is total baryonic rest mass energy",
    ", @xmath6 is total energy released in the source of grb , the fraction of energy emitted at transparency can reach several percents of the total energy . considering",
    "that typical duration of long grbs is of the order of hundreds of seconds , and p - grb typically lasts for less than few seconds @xcite luminosities of both events are comparable in magnitude .    early treatments assuming the absence of baryons and thin shell approximation , and non instantaneous energy release @xcite produced estimations of p - grbs duration @xmath7 sec for the progenitor mass range @xmath8 , much larger than the naive estimation of the gravitational collapse time @xmath9 sec , where @xmath10 is newton s constant , @xmath11 is black hole mass , @xmath12 is the speed of light .",
    "observed durations of p - grbs @xcite of most energetic grbs is of the order of several seconds .",
    "main purpose of this paper is to outline a possibility of resolution of this tension considering different mechanisms of spreading of ultrarelativistically expanding shell .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the hydrodynamic phase of grb is discussed , hydrodynamical spreading mechanism is recalled , and results of its application to grbs are shown . in sec .",
    "3 the concept of thermal spreading is introduced , evaluation of spreading for relativistic maxwellian distribution function is performed , and the results of thermal spreading computation are applied to grbs .",
    "discussion of the spreading effects on the duration of p - grb and conclusions follow in the last section .",
    "energy , entropy and baryonic number conservation laws for each differential subshell of ultrarelativistically expanding shell imply @xcite @xmath13where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are respectively comoving energy density and pressure , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are respectively comoving entropy and comoving baryon number density , @xmath18 is lorentz factor , and @xmath19 is laboratory radial coordinate . assuming polytropic equation of state @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the thermal index , equations ( 1 )",
    "can be solved for each differential subshell in ultrarelativistic and nonrelativistic asymptotic cases , respectively . recall that expanding plasma consists of two components : nonrelativistic baryons and ultrarelativistic electron - positron pairs and photons .",
    "hence , in analogy with cosmology , see e.g. @xcite , these two limiting cases are characterized by two adiabatic indices , respectively : @xmath22 when comoving temperature is relativistic ( energy dominated phase ) , and @xmath23 when comoving temperature is nonrelativistic ( matter dominated phase ) . in the latter case the pressure is usually neglected , see e.g. @xcite . in what follows",
    "we assume @xmath24 at the matter dominated phase .",
    "therefore one has @xmath25 during the energy dominated phase and @xmath26 during the matter dominated phase .",
    "these scaling laws are different from the ones in cosmology , see @xcite for details and comparison . the transition from energy to matter domination occurs at @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is initial size of the energy dominated region .",
    "in @xcite we computed the optical depth and dynamics of p - grb for the case when @xmath29 is constant across the shell .",
    "general expression for the optical depth of the shell is @xmath30 where @xmath31  is thomson s cross section and @xmath32 is the radius at which light ray emitted from the inner boundary of the shell at radius @xmath33 crosses its outer boundary . for large baryonic loading with @xmath34 where @xmath35 cm , @xmath36 erg , optical depth of the shell is @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is given by equation ( [ n0 ] ) with @xmath40 .",
    "equation ( [ tauthin ] ) correspond to the photon thin asymptotics @xcite of equation ( [ tau ] ) defined by the condition @xmath41 .",
    "the observed duration of p - grb is determined in this asymptotics by the process of radiative diffusion @xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 and time of diffusion @xmath44 was found by solution of radiative transfer equation .",
    "all these results are derived assuming constant lorentz factor across the shell .",
    "hence the width of the shell remains constant during its expansion .",
    "this fact has been used within the fireshell model and termed as the `` constant thickness approximation '' , provided that the baryon loading is not too heavy @xmath45 .",
    "hydrodynamic analytical ( @xcite , @xcite ) and numerical ( @xcite , @xcite ) calculations show that lorentz factor gradient is developing during shell expansion that leads to spreading of the shell at sufficiently large radii at the matter dominated phase .    at this phase of expansion each differential subshell is expanding with almost constant speed @xmath46 , so the spreading of the shell is determined by the radial dependence of the lorentz factor @xmath47 . in a variable shell",
    "there can be regions with @xmath47 decreasing with radius and @xmath47 increasing with radius . at sufficiently large radii only the regions with increasing @xmath29 contribute to the spreading of the shell . from equations of motion of external and internal boundaries of this region",
    "we obtain @xcite the thickness of the region as function of radial position of the region @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are lorentz factors at external and internal boundaries , @xmath51 is the width of the region at small @xmath33 , @xmath33 being the radial position of inner boundary . let us consider such a region in two limiting cases :    * when relative lorentz factor difference is strong , + @xmath52 ; * when relative lorentz factor difference is weak , + @xmath53 .    in the case",
    "( a ) the second term in parenthesis in equation  ( [ lr ] ) can be neglected , and we obtain that the spreading becomes efficient at @xmath54 , see @xcite and @xcite . in the case ( b ) we find the corresponding critical radius of hydrodynamical spreading @xmath55 . from equation ( [ lr ] )",
    "one can see that in both cases for @xmath56 width of the shell is increasing linearly with radius @xmath57 .    the discussion above corresponds to the case ( b ) since for weak lorentz factor difference @xmath58 .",
    "in what follows we focus on the case ( a ) and derive corresponding relations assuming strong relative lorentz factor difference across the shell .",
    "let us take an element of fluid with constant number of particles @xmath59 in the part of the shell with gradient of @xmath29 .",
    "internal boundary of the element is moving with velocity @xmath60 , and external one is moving with velocity @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the differential thickness at some fixed laboratory time @xmath63 and derivative @xmath64 is taken at the same laboratory time",
    ". then at time @xmath65 the width of the element is @xmath66 , its radial position is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 ia initial radial position of the element , and corresponding laboratory density is @xmath69 where @xmath70 at large enough @xmath65 using @xmath71 we have in contrast with ( [ nrscalings ] ) @xmath72    in order to compute the integral ( [ tau ] ) we need to find the expression for baryonic number density along the light ray .",
    "taking into account hydrodynamical spreading ( [ lr ] ) we obtain @xmath73 that is exact in ultrarelativistic limit .",
    "notice the difference between equations  ( [ nspralongtheray ] ) and ( [ nspr ] ) : in the former case @xmath74 is computed along the light ray , while in the latter case @xmath75 is computed along the radial coordinate at fixed laboratory time .",
    "the expression ( [ nspralongtheray ] ) reduces to equation  ( [ nrscalings ] ) when @xmath76 .",
    "instead when the second term in the denominator of the expression  ( [ nspralongtheray ] ) dominates , namely when @xmath77 , density radial dependence coincides with the one given by relations  ( [ scalingsfaraway ] ) .",
    "an estimate for @xmath74 can be given for strong relative lorentz factor difference @xmath78 in the shell @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the distance inside the shell along the light ray .",
    "numerical results from @xcite , @xcite and analytical ones from @xcite support this estimate .    integrating expression  ( [ dgdr ] )",
    "we obtain lorentz factor dependence on radial coordinate along the light ray @xmath81 since we are interested in the asymptotics when the hydrodynamical spreading is essential , we can assume in the integral ( [ tau ] ) @xmath82 and @xmath83 . under these conditions",
    "the optical depth is @xmath84 this result coincides with equation  ( [ tauthin ] ) up to a numerical factor .",
    "however its physical meaning is different .",
    "it represents photon thick asymptotics of equation ( [ tau ] ) , since @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "transparency radius is defined by equating ( [ tauspreading ] ) to unity and is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is proton mass . at the radius of transparency the width of the shell ( [ lr ] ) spreads up to @xmath87 where @xmath88 .    in this case",
    "radiative diffusion is irrelevant and duration of p - grb is then given by the time of arrival of photons emitted from the shell all the way up to @xmath89 @xmath90 in contrast to equation ( [ tathin ] ) in the case of strong lorentz factor difference , namely with @xmath91 , this duration can be of the order of several seconds with agreement with observations .",
    "we now determine the velocity spread of particles as a function of comoving temperature @xmath92 and bulk lorentz factor @xmath29 for relativistic maxwellian distribution . based on this result",
    "we compute the value of thermal spreading of expanding shell .",

    "velocity dispersion in the @xmath94-direction is @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes the average value of @xmath98 , which is defined by the convolution with the distribution function ( [ maxwellboost ] ) @xmath99 the above written integrals can not be computed analytically , but their numerical approximations can be found .",
    "numerical issues in the velocity dispersion calculations by ( [ dispersion ] ) arise from the fact that for high @xmath29 we need to subtract two numbers @xmath100 and @xmath101 which are very close to each other and to @xmath102 .",
    "this leads to substantial reduction of accuracy . a different formula for dispersion@xmath103^{2 } )",
    "\\label{dispersiondef}\\ ] ] proves to be more convenient .",
    "the spread of particle velocities is then @xmath104 .    for nonrelativistic comoving temperatures the correct asymptotics",
    "is @xmath105 the case of ultrarelativistic comoving temperature ( @xmath106 ) is more interesting .",
    "starting close to the maximal value @xmath107 , the velocity spread for @xmath108 reaches approximately @xmath109 which means that the dispersion is independent on the temperature . for @xmath110",
    "the asymptotics ( [ asymptotics ] ) is restored just up to a multiplier close to unity @xmath111    our results suggest that ( [ urmediumasymptotics ] ) gives absolute upper limit for the velocity spread , and temperature dependence of ( asymptotics ) and ( [ urhighasymptotics ] ) reduce the spread even further .    initial temperature of the plasma formed in the source of grb can be estimated from its initial size @xmath112 cm and total energy released @xmath113 assuming that the temperature is determined by @xmath114  pairs only @xmath115 we get for initial temperature @xmath116 at radiation dominated phase the comoving temperature of the plasma decreases as @xmath117 , at matter dominated phase as @xmath118 .",
    "now we compute the thermal spreading at both phases .",
    "for the first phase the reasonable approximation of lorentz factor is @xmath119 due to the nature of lorentz transformations in constantly accelerated frame the final spreading of the shell @xmath120 appears to be finite even if we extend this phase infinitely in time , and the main part of the spreading is connected with initial part of motion with relatively small @xmath29 .",
    "while the temperature of protons in the source of grb is nonrelativistic @xmath121 , velocity spread is given by ( [ asymptotics ] ) which in energy dominated phase leads to the spreading @xmath122    in the matter dominated phase the additional spreading of the shell is @xmath123 when @xmath124 .",
    "comparing to the hydrodynamical spreading for reasonable grb parameters the spreading coming from both ( [ nr1 ] ) and ( [ nr2 ] ) is negligible .",
    "note that velocity dispersion in any case does not exceed the value given by equation  ( [ urmediumasymptotics ] ) with @xmath125 @xmath126 which gives an absolute maximum of the thermal spreading on the energy dominated phase .",
    "in this paper we considered two mechanisms of spreading of relativistically expanding plasma shell .",
    "we also discuss their implications for the duration of electromagnetic signal from transparency of the plasma .",
    "firstly , following the proposal of @xcite hydrodynamical spreading of relativistically expanding shell is estimated .",
    "secondly , thermal spreading is considered .",
    "assuming relativistic maxwellian distribution function we determined the velocity dispersion depending on temperature and the lorentz factor of the bulk motion .",
    "we then applied these results to grbs within the framework of the fireshell model .",
    "it is shown that thermal spreading provides negligible spreading for typical parameters of grbs . instead , hydrodynamical spreading results in the increase of the duration of p - grb . for nonspreading shells characterized by almost constant lorentz factor distribution within the shell the duration of p - grb",
    "is determined by the time of diffusion , see equation ( [ tathin ] ) .",
    "if strong lorentz factor difference is present within the shell , hydrodynamical spreading prevents occurrence of photon thin asymptotics and leads to duration of p - grb given by equation ( [ taspr ] ) .",
    "our results imply that for high enough baryon loading and energy of the burst the duration of the p - grb is not determined by the initial size of the plasma @xmath28 , but by the value of the hydrodynamical spreading , reaching up to several seconds .                    ,",
