    "in @xcite , we considered the problem of obtaining quantitative results describing the ergodic behavior of time inhomogeneous finite markov chains . in general , a time inhomogeneous markov chain ,",

    "more generally , for @xmath8 , we define @xmath9 inductively by @xmath10 ( the identity matrix ) and @xmath11    if each @xmath12 is irreducible and aperiodic , one expects that , in many cases , the markov chain driven by this sequence will have the property that @xmath13 we call this property _ total variation merging _ and say that the chain driven by the sequence @xmath5 is merging .",
    "note that , in general , @xmath7 does not tend to a limiting distribution .",
    "however , when merging occurs , the chain does forget where it started : asymptotically , the distribution sequence evolves in time following a well - defined pattern which is independent of the starting distribution .    in this paper",
    ", we will mostly discuss a stronger notion which we call relative - sup merging . by definition ,",
    "the sequence @xmath5 is merging in relative - sup if @xmath14    in general , the relative - sup distance between two measures @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( on a finite or countable state space ) is defined by ( note the asymmetry ) @xmath17 in particular , for a time inhomogeneous chain driven by a sequence @xmath5 of markov kernels , we will consider quantities such as @xmath18 where @xmath19 for some starting measure @xmath20 .",
    "for @xmath21 , we also define the @xmath22 relative - sup merging time @xmath23 by @xmath24 see @xcite for more details .",
    "background and general results concerning time inhomogeneous markov chains are described in @xcite where further references can be found .",
    "it turns out that the study of merging is difficult , both at the qualitative and the quantitative level , except in the special but interesting case when all the kernels in the sequence @xmath5 share the same stationary probability measure .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "only a small set of examples have been treated in the literature mostly because proving anything about concrete time inhomogeneous markov chains is difficult .",
    "this paper describes a special class of examples whose structure is , in itself , quite interesting and for which some results can be obtained .",
    "the set up is as follows . on a finite or countable set @xmath0",
    ", we are given a markov kernel @xmath3 and a bijection @xmath25 .",
    "we then consider the time inhomogeneous markov chain driven by the sequence of the kernels @xmath26 the problem is to study this time inhomogeneous chain and its merging properties .",
    "as we shall see , this covers some interesting examples and leads to interesting results as well as difficult open problems .",
    "the examples discussed in this paper can serve to illustrate the techniques developed in @xcite .",

    "then @xmath30    this good - looking result is deceptive because , unless one can get some control on the sequence of measures @xmath31 , it is essentially useless .",
    "note in particular that @xmath32 depends very much on @xmath33 and @xmath31 .",
    "it is well established that the stationary distribution of an irreducible aperiodic time homogeneous markov chain plays a crucial part in the analysis of the ergodic properties of the chain .",
    "not much can be said unless one can get some control on the stationary distribution .",
    "moreover , unless the chain is reversible or some algebraic miracle occurs , the computation of the stationary measure is a difficult problem .",
    "the situation for time inhomogeneous markov chains is much worse . in order to understand how the chain behaves",
    "when started from an arbitrary distribution , it is crucial to find ( at least ) _ one _ initial distribution @xmath20 such that sequence of probability measures @xmath19 is somewhat well behaved .",
    "the ideal situation is when there is a @xmath34 such @xmath35 .",
    "this occurs if an only if all @xmath12 admit the same invariant measure @xmath34 , a rather fortunate but rare circumstance .",

    "we refer the reader to @xcite , for examples , and results involving @xmath38-stability .",
    "the idea behind this definition is that , if a sequence is @xmath38-stable with respect to a probability measure @xmath20 , then one can study the merging of this sequence _ more or less _ as one would study the ergodicity of a time homogeneous chain with invariant measure @xmath20 . why this is true is not obvious and the required technical details are quite intricate .",
    "precise results in this direction are described in @xcite .",
    "we think that @xmath38-stability is an interesting property in itself and that it deserves some attention .",

    "the case of the two point space is treated in @xcite .",
    "a special case of interest to us here is when the time inhomogeneous markov chain is driven by a sequence @xmath5 that is periodic in the sense that there is an integer @xmath40 such that @xmath41 in such case , there is an obvious candidate for a `` good '' starting distribution @xmath20 , namely , the invariant measure @xmath34 of @xmath42 . indeed ,",

    "of course , in this example , the uniform measure is invariant for all @xmath46 .",
    "other examples of periodic time inhomogeneous chains are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we now describe in detail the construction outlined in the introduction .",
    "this construction is of a rather general nature and produces periodic time inhomogeneous markov chains that reduce , in a sense , to time homogeneous chains .",
