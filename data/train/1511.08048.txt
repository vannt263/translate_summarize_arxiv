    "extra - dimensional gravity theories have a long history that begins with an original idea propounded by kaluza and klein @xcite as a way for unifying the electromagnetic and gravitational fields , and nowadays finds a new realization within the modern string theory @xcite . among the higher - dimensional models of gravity , the five - dimensional randall - sundrum brane worlds models @xcite have acquired great attention in the last decade .",
    "in particular , their second model @xcite can be described by a single brane , i.e a 3 + 1-dimensional hyper - surface embedded into a higher - dimensional space - time , in which the matter and gauge fields of the standard model are confined to it , while the gravitational field can propagate in the fifth dimension , which have an infinite size . from the cosmological point of view , brane worlds offer a novel approach to our understanding of the evolution of the universe and they have exhibited interesting cosmological implications , as witnessed in the study of missing matter problems , as well as providing a new mechanism to explain the acceleration of the universe based on modifications of general relativity ( gr ) , instead of introducing an exotic content of matter , for instance see ref . @xcite and the references therein . on the other hand , dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) brane world model @xcite , whose gravity behaves as four - dimensional at short distance scale but it shows higher - dimensional nature at larger distances , also has attracted a great interest in the last decade @xcite .",
    "this brane world model is characterized by the brane on which the fields of the standard model are confined , and contains the induced einstein - hilbert term .",
    "it also exhibits several cosmological features @xcite .",
    "also , it was shown that the effective 4-dimensional equations obtained by projecting the 5-dimensional metric onto the brane acquire corrections terms to gr @xcite . additionally ,",
    "brane world models with a non - singular or thick brane have been considered in the literature , see for instance @xcite and references there in .    in this work ,",
    "we study the geodesic structure for a geometry described by a schwarzschild four - dimensional solution embedded into a five - dimensional space .",
    "the metric is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 stands for the extra dimension .",
    "besides , this line element can be related to the so - called black - string @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by adding an extra flat dimension to the kerr solution of gr and performing a boost in the fifth dimension to this five - dimensional metric , and then compactifying the extra dimension , a new four - dimensional charged spherically symmetric black hole together with a maxwell and dilaton field was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hidden symmetries and geodesics of kerr spacetime in kaluza - klein theory was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors set up the mass parameter to be far below the value necessary for a black - hole solution , and investigate how the embedding of the solution into the extra - dimensional scenario can be related to the classic tests performed in gr such as the perihelion shift of the planet mercury , the deflection of light by the sun , and the gravitational redshift of atomic spectral lines .",
    "in this paper we adopt the same constraint on the mass parameter .",
    "it is worth to mention that the classical tests of gr have been examined for various spherically symmetric static vacuum solutions of braneworld models , for instance see @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is worth to mention that the geometrical localization mechanism implies a four - dimensional mass for the photon @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : in sec .",
    "[ stl ] we present the procedure to obtain the equations of motion for neutral particles in the brane - based spherically symmetric solutions .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii we give the exact solution for the circular orbits .",
    "the analytical solution for the orbits with angular momentum in terms of the the @xmath2-weierstrass elliptic function is described in sec .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "v , we study the radial trajectories . finally , in sec . [ summ ] we conclude with some comments and final remarks .",
    "first , we consider a light - cone type transformation in spherical coordinates , embedded into a five - dimensional space @xcite given by @xmath3 in this way , eq .",
    "( [ metric1 ] ) becomes @xmath4 now , with the aim to study the motion of neutral particles around a brane - based spherically symmetric solution , we derive the geodesic equations .",
    "so , the lagrangian associated to the metric ( [ metric ] ) results to be @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is an affine parameter along the geodesic that we choose as the proper time , and @xmath8 is the test mass of the particle ( @xmath9 for massive particles and @xmath10 for photons ) .",
    "the equations of motion are obtained from @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the conjugate momenta to the coordinate @xmath13 , which yields @xmath14 @xmath15 so , we can observe that the conjugate momenta associated to the coordinates @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are conserved .",
    "therefore @xmath19 @xmath20 now , without lack of generality we consider that the motion is developed in the invariant plane @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "so the above equation can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the angular momentum of the particle , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are dimensionless integration constants .",
    "thus , by defining @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we obtain @xmath29 note that the coordinate @xmath1 can be obtained subtracting eqns .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) , @xmath30 thus , the coordinate @xmath31 increases linearly with the affine parameter @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the particles can scape to the additional dimension .",
    "however , this is not a problem due to the fifth dimension is assumed to be compact with a very small radius . finally , by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) and ( [ e10 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) , it follows that @xmath32 note that the constant @xmath33 of the extra dimension contributes to the particle test mass in the above equation .",
    "so , we define the new constant @xmath34 , which we may call _ the anomalous test mass_. therefore , the effective potential @xmath35 can be written as @xmath36 which is showed in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , where the point indicates the last stable circular orbit .",
    "observe that for photons @xmath10 ; however , @xmath37 is positive .",
    "this fact implies that there are bounded orbits for the photons . in the following , despite of the geodesics are for photons and particles , we will plot only the photon case ( @xmath38 ) .     and",
    "@xmath39.,width=377 ]    on the other hand , if we consider eq .",
    "( [ e11 ] ) , the orbit in polar coordinates is given by @xmath40.\\ ] ] this equation determines the geometry of the geodesic .",
    "moreover , the orbital binet equation yields @xmath41 where we have used the keplerian change of variable @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "it is known that the circular orbits ( @xmath44 ) correspond to an extreme value of the potential , that is , @xmath45 .",
    "the last stable circular orbit occurs when the angular momentum is @xmath46 , which depends on the anomalous test mass .",
    "however , the minimum radius of stable circular orbit is @xmath47 , and does not depend on the anomalous test mass .",
    "therefore , if @xmath48 there are not circular orbits , and if @xmath49 the circular orbits can be stable ( @xmath50 ) and unstable ( @xmath51 ) , which yields @xmath52 it is important to mention that , despite of the mass test of the photon is null the anomalous test mass is positive .",
    "therefore , there are stable circular orbits for the light .",
    "now , in order to estimate the radius of the circular orbits for photons , consider for example a circular orbit for photons around the sun , without considering the effect of other bodies .",
    "the geometrical mass @xmath53 and the ratio @xmath54 are constrained to @xcite : @xmath55 thus , considering @xmath56 from eqn .",
    "( [ e15 ] ) we obtain the radius @xmath57 .",
    "on the other hand , the periods for one complete revolution of these circular orbits , measured in proper time and coordinate time ( @xmath58 ) , are @xmath59 on the other hand , expanding the effective potential around to @xmath60 , we can write @xmath61 where @xmath62 means derivative with respect to the radial coordinate . obviously , in this orbits @xmath63 .",
    "so , by defining the _ smaller _ coordinate @xmath64 , together with _ the epicycle frequency _",
    "@xcite , we can rewrite the above equation as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the energy of the particle at the stable circular orbit . also , it is forward to see that test particles satisfy the harmonic equation of motion @xmath68 therefore , in our case , the epicycle frequency is given by @xmath69.\\ ] ] notice that when @xmath70 , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the epicycle frequency in the schwarzschild case .",
    "now , in order to obtain a full description of the motion of the neutral particles , we will find analytically the geodesics .",
    "so , let us rewrite eq .",
    "( [ e13 ] ) as @xmath73 where the characteristic polynomial @xmath74 is given by @xmath75 so , we can see that depending of the nature of its roots , we shall obtain the allowed motions for this configuration . therefore , by integrating eq .",
    "( [ tl11a ] ) , we obtain the polar form to the first kind orbit of the neutral massive particles , which yields @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the @xmath2-weierstrass elliptic function , with the weierstrass invariants given by @xmath78,\\ ] ] being @xmath79 an integration constant and @xmath80 the return point of the particle .",
    "orbits of the first kind occur when the energy lies in the range @xmath81 , and this case require that @xmath82 allows three real roots , all of which are positive ; and we shall write them as @xmath83,\\qquad ( \\nu=0 , 1 , 2)\\ ] ] where @xmath84 , \\\\ \\label{c9 }    \\eta_3 & = & 4\\left[{2 \\over 27 }    \\left({2m\\tilde{\\mu}^2\\over \\tilde{\\mu}^2-k^2/2}\\right)^3- { 1 \\over 3 } \\left({2m\\tilde{\\mu}^2\\over \\tilde{\\mu}^2-k^2/2 } \\right ) \\left({h^2\\over \\tilde{\\mu}^2-k^2/2 } \\right ) + { 2mh^2\\over \\tilde{\\mu}^2-k^2/2}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "so , we can identify the apoastro distance as @xmath85 , and the periastro distance as @xmath86 , while the third solution can be recognized as the apoastro distance to the orbits of the second kind , @xmath87 , see fig .",
    "[ f2 ] . in this way",

    "in this manuscript , we have studied the geodesic structure for a geometry described by a spherically symmetric four - dimensional solution embedded into a five - dimensional space known as brane - based spherically symmetric solution , and we have described the different kinds of orbits for particles and photons . mainly , we have found that the extra dimension contributes to the particle test mass , that we have called _ the anomalous test mass _ which is positive for photons .",
