    "there has been much interest in recent years in the study of black hole solutions in gravitational theories with a negative cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "the initial interest in asymptotically anti - de sitter ( aads ) solutions was due to the result that ( sufficiently large ) schwarzschild - ads ( sads ) black holes are thermodynamically stable @xcite .",
    "a renewed interest in the study of aads black holes has appeared following the ads / conformal field theory conjecture , which proposes a correspondence between physical effects associated with gravitating fields propagating in ads spacetime and those of a conformal field theory ( cft ) on the boundary of ads spacetime @xcite .",
    "the aads black hole solutions would offer the posibility of studying the nonperturbative structure of some conformal field theories .",
    "for example , the ads@xmath4 hawking - page phase transition @xcite is interpreted as a thermal phase transition from a confining to a deconfining phase in the dual @xmath5 , @xmath6 super yang - mills theory @xcite , while the phase structure of reissner- nordstrm - ads black holes resembles that of a van der waals - maxwell liquid - gas system @xcite .",
    "also , when @xmath7 , the so - called topological black holes , whose topology of the event horizon is no longer the two - sphere @xmath8 may appear ( see @xcite for reviews of the subject ) .",
    "these results motivate at least partially attempts to find new black hole solutions in aads spacetimes .",
    "particularly interesting are solutions violating the no hair conjecture .",
    "this conjecture states that the only allowed characteristics of a stationary black hole are those associated with the gauss law , such as mass angular momentum and u(1 ) charge .",
    "black holes with hair may be useful for probing not only quantum gravity , but also may be interesting tests of the ads / cft correspondence , particularly since we can find such objects which are classically stable . for aads black holes ,",
    "it has been shown recently that conformally coupled scalar field can be painted as hair @xcite .",
    "the existence of long range nielson - olesen vortex as hair for asymptotically ads black holes has been investigated in @xcite for sads black hole and charged black strings .",
    "aads black holes solutions with su(2 ) nonabelian fields have been presented in @xcite .",
    "the obtained results are strikingly different from those valid in the asymptotically flat case ( nontrivial solutions exist for all values of @xmath7 ) .",
    "for example , regular black hole solutions exist for continuous intervals of the parameter space , rather than discrete points and there are configurations for which the gauge field has no zeros . regular and black hole dyon solutions without a higgs field have also been found @xcite .",
    "insofar as the no - hair theorem is concerned , it has been shown that there exist stable black hole solutions in su(2 ) einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory that are aads @xcite .",
    "however , the same system in the presence of a higgs scalar field presents only configurations with very similar properties to the asymptotically - flat space counterparts @xcite .",
    "the literature on aads solutions with nonabelian fields is continuously growing , including stability analyses @xcite , the study of configurations with a nut charge @xcite , higher dimensional counterparts @xcite and axially symmetric generalizations @xcite . here",
    "we remark that the eym black hole solutions with @xmath7 discussed in the literature are spherically symmetric or correspond to topological black holes @xcite presenting the same amount of symmetry .",
    "however , for a vanishing cosmological constant , the eym - su(2 ) theory is known to possess also static axially symmetric finite energy black hole solutions , as exhaustively discussed in @xcite .",
    "the situation for a nonabelian field is very different from the einstein - maxwell theory , where the static black hole solution is spherically symmetric .",
    "representing generalizations of the well known spherically symmetric asymptotically flat black hole solutions @xcite , these static axially symmetric solutions are characterized by two integers , for a given event event horizon radius .",
    "these are the node number @xmath9 of the gauge field functions and the winding number @xmath10 with respect to the azimuthal angle @xmath11 .",
    "the static spherically symmetric solutions have winding number @xmath12 .",
    "similar to the case of regular configurations @xcite , winding numbers @xmath13 leads to axially symmetric black hole solutions . outside their regular event horizon , the static @xmath14 axially symmetric black hole solutions",
    "possess non - trivial magnetic gauge field configurations , but they carry no global magnetic charge . in a remarkable development ,",
    "these asymptotically flat black hole solutions have been generalized to include the effects of rotation , leading to nonabelian counterparts of the kerr - newmann solution @xcite .",
    "the regular @xmath15 axially symmetric eym configurations of ref .",
    "@xcite have been generalized for @xmath7 in ref .",
    "although some common features are present , the results in the aads case are rather different from those valid in the @xmath14 limit , in particular presenting arbitrary values for the mass and magnetic charge .",
    "these distinctions arise from differences that already exist in the spherically symmetric case .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that the aads axially symmetric regular solutions discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite can be generalized to include a black hole event horizon inside them .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present numerical arguments for the existence of this type of configurations and to analyze the properties of the axially symmetric eym - su(2 ) black hole solutions , in light of the existing results for the asymptotically flat case , discussing the points where the differences are relevant .",
    "the numerical methods used here are similar to the methods succesfully employed for @xmath7 axially symmetric regular solutions .",
    "the mass of these solutions is computed by using a counterterm method inspired by the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "although further research is clearly necessary , at least some of these solutions , emerging as consistent reduction of @xmath2 supergravity on a seventh dimenensional sphere @xcite , may have a relevance in ads / cft context . in this case",
    "the four - dimensional cosmological constant is completely fixed by the gauge coupling constant and exact solutions for configurations preserving some amount of supersymmetry are likely to exist .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in the next section we explain the model and derive the basic equations , while in section 3 we present a detailed computation of the physical quantities of the solutions such as mass , magnetic charge , temperature and entropy noting the relevance of a special class of solutions in @xmath2 supergravity . in section 4",
    "solutions of ym equations in a fixed sads background are discussed .",
    "some features of the axially symmetric solutions possessing a net ym electric charge in a fixed sads black hole background are also presented in this section .",
    "the general properties of the axially symmetric gravitating solutions are presented in section 5 where we show results obtained by numerical calculations .",
    "we give our conclusions and remarks in the final section .",
    "the appendix contains a derivation of an exact solution of the eym equations with negative cosmological constant with a planar symmetry .",

    "searching for axially symmetric solutions within the most general ansatz is a difficult task , and , to our knowledge there are no analytical or numerical results in this case .",

    "the explicit expression of the field strength tensor for this ansatz is given in @xcite .",
    "to fix the residual abelian gauge invariance we choose the usual gauge condition @xcite-@xcite @xmath65 the ansatz ( [ a - gen - sph ] ) contains an integer @xmath10 , representing the winding number with respect to the azimutal angle @xmath11 . while @xmath11 covers the trigonometric circle once , the fields wind @xmath10 times around .",

    "the boundary conditions at infinity and along the @xmath42 and the @xmath75-axis ( i.e for @xmath76 ) agree with those of the globally regular solutions @xcite .",
