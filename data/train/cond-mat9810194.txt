    "investigations of plasmons in small clusters of nanometer size range have a long history .",
    "originally plasma oscillations were studied in small ( @xmath1 nm ) metal particles .",
    "it turned out that plasmons in metal clusters can be well described by linearized hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",
    "the positions of plasmon peaks , their number and fast electron cross - sections calculated within these equations are in good agreement with experimental data .",
    "new possibilities of the investigation of plasmons in small objects appeared after the discovery of fullerenes and the cheap methods of their synthesis .",
    "plasmon oscillations were observed in fullerene molecules @xcite , carbon nanometer size tubes @xcite and multishell fullerenes @xcite .",
    "an important feature of fullerenes is the fact that these molecules are more or less of a spherical form and their electrons can be considered to be confined to the surface of the sphere@xcite .",
    "hence , it seems to be a good starting point to consider the @xmath0 molecule as a rolled up graphite plane .",
    "this approximation is expected to work well for the description of collective excitations .",
    "the graphite plane consists of regular hexagons formed by carbon atoms .",
    "each carbon atom is connected by 3 @xmath2-bonds with its three neighbours , meanwhile @xmath3-electrons form a common @xmath3-system consisiting of orbitals perpendicular to the plane . in linear response theory @xmath3 and @xmath2-electron subsystems can be considered to be independent with respect to the electrical field parallel to the graphite plane because dipole transitions from @xmath3 to @xmath2-orbitals are prohibited .",
    "this means that we can describe the plasmons in graphite whose wave vector is parallel to the plane as the plasmons in a  two - liquid \" electron system ; it is proposed that both the liquids move in a common average potential .",
    "the graphite loss function -im@xmath4 with respect to the external electric field perpendicular to the @xmath5-axis shows two peaks at 7 and 28 ev ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "they are called @xmath3- and @xmath2- ( or @xmath6- ) plasmons . strictly speaking such a division",
    "is rather conventional .",
    "in fact , both @xmath3- and @xmath2-electrons make a nonzero contribution to @xmath2- and @xmath3-plasmons respectively .    in the articles@xcite cazaux",
    "used the two - fluid model in order to explain the results of eels studies on graphite .",
    "the same idea was used in ref.@xcite for the description of plasmons in the @xmath0 molecule : it was proposed that @xmath3-electrons be affected only by induced electric potential , meanwhile @xmath2-electrons be governed also by a restoring force .",
    "this force appears in the model via an effective description of a contribution of valent electrons to the polarizability @xcite .    using the two - fluid model barton and eberlein predicted the existence of plasma oscillations in the @xmath0 molecule which can be classified by the spherical quantum numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the index @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) which corresponds to @xmath3- and @xmath2-plasmons @xcite .",
    "however , the plasmons with large @xmath7 can not exist because of their strong damping .",
    "eels studies on @xmath0 ( see refs.@xcite ) show a peak at 6.5 - 7 ev ( also called  @xmath3-plasmon \" ) and a rather broad  @xmath2-plasmon \" peak at 15 - 16 ev .",
    "the former peak is identified usually as the @xmath11 @xmath3-plasmon , meanwhile the latter peak is considered to be a combination of the @xmath11 @xmath2-plasmon and probably the plasmons with @xmath12 .",
    "however the existence of multipole plasmons in @xmath0 is still not clear . in ref.@xcite a small peak at 28 ev",
    "was observed and identified as the @xmath11 @xmath2-plasmon .",
    "the main goal of this work is to calculate the cross - section of fast electrons scattered by a @xmath0 molecule and to show that the contribution of the plasmons with @xmath13 to the cross - section is enough in order to be observed in eels experiments . in the model we use",
    "it is possible to separate contributions of different plasmons , i.e. one can obtain relative cross - sections . using this approach we can not calculate plasmon damping .",
    "widths of plasmon peaks will be taken from experimental data .",
    "we shall consider electrons in the @xmath0 molecule to be distributed over the surface of a uniformly charged sphere  the positive molecular core in the model .",
    "the fourier transformation of the charge density @xmath14 induced by the potential @xmath15 including both the external and induced potentials is given by the expression @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the surface @xmath3- and @xmath2-electron density , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the oscillator strength and electron energy levels .",
    "the index @xmath20 numerates the electron states .",
    "@xmath21 denotes the angular part of the laplas operator : in the model we use electrons can not move perpendicularly to the surface .",
    "as the @xmath3-electron subsystem of graphite is semimetal , we can use the following approximation for the @xmath3-electron contribution to the induced charge density : @xmath22    we suggested @xmath23 in equation @xmath24 to be equal to zero and used the sum rule @xmath25 for the oscillator strength of @xmath3-electrons in @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the number of @xmath3-electrons and the effective radius of the sphere respectively .    on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath2-electron subsystem of graphite is dielectric with the gap of order @xmath29 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the oscillator strength of the @xmath2-electron subsystem has a maximum at @xmath30 hence we can use the following approximate expression for the @xmath2-electron contribution @xmath31 here we used the sum rule @xmath32 for the @xmath2-electron subsystem .",
    "@xmath33 is the characteristic transition frequency of @xmath2-electrons .",
    "@xmath34  -  electrons of carbon atoms are not taken into account in the model .",
    "the @xmath15-field is connected with the total induced charge density @xmath35 through the gauss theorem @xmath36 it is convenient to expand the density fields in fourier series on the sphere @xmath37 then using the multipole expansion of the potential @xmath15    @xmath38 we can rewrite ( [ gauss ] ) in the following form @xmath39 which gives for ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) ( see also refs.@xcite ) @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42    it can be easily verified by straightforward calculation that equations ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) are the equations of motion corresponding to the hamiltonian @xmath43 where the amplitudes @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the @xmath46-components of the displacement fields @xmath47 and @xmath48 of the electron liquids which are connected with @xmath49 and @xmath50 by the following equations @xmath51    the coefficients in equation ( [ eqnarray ] ) are chosen so as to keep it equal to the hydrodynamic hamiltonian @xmath52    hamiltonian ( [ eqnarray ] ) is nondiagonal in the basis consisting of the functions @xmath53 because of the last term . on the other hand , this term does not mix amplitudes with different @xmath7 and @xmath54 because of the spherical simmetry of the model , hence the above hamiltonian can be diagonalized by the diagonalization of each  block \" with a number @xmath55    we have shown that the problem can be reduced to the diagonalization of the hamiltonian @xmath56 which can be done by the following transformation @xmath57 @xmath58 where the angle @xmath59 can be found from the condition of the disappearance of the nondiagonal term in hamiltonian @xmath60 expressed in terms of the new coordinates @xmath61 and @xmath62 the substitution of @xmath63 and @xmath64 into equation @xmath60 gives @xmath65 the eigenfrequencies @xmath66 are given by the following equation @xmath67    one can clearly see that charge oscillations can be classified by the numbers @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the index @xmath9 corresponding to the lower and upper roots of equation @xmath68 the fact that the eigenfrequencies do not depend on the number @xmath8 is due to the spherical symmetry of the considered model .    using @xmath69 we can find quantum mechanical operators for amplitudes @xmath44 and",
    "@xmath70 substituting them into the equation for classical charge density fluctuations we obtain the operator corresponding to this quantity @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the annihilation operator of the plasmon with numbers @xmath73 and the functions @xmath74 and @xmath75 are given by the equations @xmath76 the angle @xmath59 is chosen to be the minimal positive root of equation @xmath77",
    "in this section we will obtain the expression for the scattering amplitude of fast electrons due to charge density fluctuations in @xmath78 in the secondary quantization representation the electron - plasmon interaction can be written as follows @xmath79 here @xmath80 is the electron field operator , @xmath81 is the potential corresponding to the electron surface density distribution @xmath82 i.e. @xmath83 is the solution of the poisson equation with the charge density @xmath84 hence @xmath83 and @xmath85 are connected by the following equation @xmath86    substituting equation @xmath87 and the explicit expressions for the electron field and the electron density fluctuation operators ( see ( [ 29a ] ) ) into equaiton @xmath88 we obtain the expression for the electron - plasmon interaction @xmath89 we shall consider only the case of fast scattering electrons , i.e. the only relevant processes are those in connection with the creation of one plasmon .",
    "hence we can use the born approximation .",
    "the quantitative criterium of the applicability of the born approximation will be discussed further .    in the initial state",
    "all the plasmon occupation numbers are equal to zero .",
    "let us suppose that after scattering only the occupation number of the state @xmath90 is equal to one . defining the initial and final momenta of the scattering electron @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    "respectively we obtain the following expression for the modulus squared of the matrix element of @xmath93 @xmath94 where @xmath95    as each eigenfrequency @xmath66 is @xmath96-fold degenerated , we shall calculate the total cross - section for the transferred energy @xmath97 summing up the contributions of plasmons with given @xmath7 and @xmath9 over @xmath8 we get @xmath98 in the above equation @xmath99 @xmath100 is the initial velocity of the electron .    using the equation @xmath101 ( see ref.@xcite ) we get after some algebra @xmath102",
    "in experiments one can measure the number of electrons reaching a detector , i.e. one measures the function @xmath103 integrated over a certain solid angle .",
    "let this solid angle be restricted by two cones of angles @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively . in this case we can write for the total cross - section @xmath106 @xmath107 where @xmath108 @xmath109    we shall consider the case of small transferred energy , i.e. @xmath110 in principle",
    ", several different situations are possible .",
    "if both the angles @xmath111 and @xmath112 are small , the integration limits in the integral in @xmath113 are also small and we can expand the spherical bessel function into a taylor series and take only the first term of the expansion . as @xmath114 if @xmath115 we get @xmath116 and one can clearly see that the contribution of the plasmons with @xmath11 is dominant . in the opposite situation @xmath117 we can use the asymptotic expression for the spherical bessel function @xmath118 if @xmath119 as the integration limits do not depend on @xmath7 significantly , we can see that the values of the integral in @xmath113 are of the same order for different @xmath120 hence the relative contributions of plasmons with different @xmath7 depend only on the factor @xmath121 in the case @xmath122 it is possible to estimate the integral in @xmath113 by the substitution @xmath123 one can clearly see that only the contribution of the plasmons with small @xmath7 is relevant because of the rapidly increasing multiplier @xmath124 in the denominator .    strictly speaking",
    "the above analysis is not applicable for the plasmons with @xmath125 the @xmath0 symmetry group is icosahedral and it does not have irreducible representations with a dimension of more than five . hence the plasmons with @xmath126 in the spherical model split @xcite and the classification of plasmons in the real @xmath0 molecule is different .",
    "we will not discuss further this difference because in the experiments which we will analyse only the contribution of the plasmons @xmath127 is relevant . on the other hand",
    ", the small size of @xmath0 leads to the strong damping of plasmons .",
    "the estimation for the spherical model in ref.@xcite shows that the plasmons with @xmath126 could hardly exist .",
    "we shall compare our results to the experiment from ref.@xcite . in this work the number of electrons with @xmath128 scattering in the solid angle @xmath129 ( i.e. @xmath130 ) per unit time was measured .",
    "the average cross - section @xmath131 obtained using the spherical model for the plasmons with @xmath132 is shown in table  [ table ] .",
    "we used the value @xmath133 for the characteristic @xmath2-electron transition frequencies and @xmath134 for the radius of the sphere in the model .",
    "for the conditions of the analised experiments @xmath122 and one can clearly see that the contribution of the plasmons with @xmath135 decays rapidly .",
    "this is in good agreement with the qualitative consideration .",
    "the @xmath11 @xmath3- and @xmath2-plasmons and the quadrupole @xmath2-plasmon make the most significant contribution to the cross - section .",
    "plasmons in @xmath136 are characterized by strong damping due to the small size of the molecule : in small objects the energy of plasma oscillations per one electron @xmath137 is strongly enhanced and leads to strong electron - electron scattering , meanwhile for bulk plasmons this energy is negligible . as energies of @xmath3- and @xmath2-plasmons do not depend on @xmath7 significantly ( see table[table ] ) , the parameter @xmath138 is approximately the same for @xmath3- and @xmath2-plasmons respectively and we can expect that the damping of plasmons does not depend on @xmath7 strongly .    in the above calculation of the cross - section we did not take into account plasmon damping .",
    "the characteristic inverse life time @xmath139 taken from the experiment is equal to @xmath140 and @xmath141 for @xmath142- and @xmath2-plasmons respectively .",
    "the function @xmath143 is plotted in fig .  1 together with the experimental curve .",
    "one can see that our results are in good agreement with the experiment . as it can be seen from table[table ] and fig .",
    "1 the first peak on the graph corresponds to the dipole @xmath3-plasmon ; the second peak corresponds to the dipole and quadrupole @xmath2-plasmons .",
    "the contributions of the other plasmons are small .",
    "it has already been discussed that ratios @xmath144 are proportional in our case to ratios @xmath145 note that although @xmath146 we have for the cross - sections @xmath147 and the ratio @xmath144 decreases if @xmath7 increases .",
    "this is the consequence of the fact that @xmath148 if @xmath149 for large @xmath7 we can write using equation @xmath150 @xmath151 hence @xmath152 ( see @xmath153 ) and we obtain an interesting result : the ratio @xmath144 tends to zero if @xmath154    let us discuss the condition of the applicability of the born approximation .",
    "the born approximation is valid if @xmath155 ( see ref.@xcite ) where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the characteristic value of the potential and its radius respectively , @xmath158 is the velocity of the scattering particle . in our case",
    "the characteristic value of charge density fluctuations @xmath159 is @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the characteristic oscillation frequency .",
    "hence @xmath162 and the condition of the applicability can be written as follows @xmath163    substituting @xmath164 @xmath165 @xmath28 into @xmath166 we see that the born approximation is applicable if the velocity of the scattering electron satisfies the condition @xmath167  cm / s . in the analysed experiments the electron velocity is @xmath168",
    "cm / s , i.e. the born approximation is applicable .    briefly summarizing we have shown that the simple two - fluid model used by the authors of @xcite for the predictions of the collective spectrum of @xmath0 turned out to be good for the quantitative calculations of the intensities of the plasmon peaks in eels spectra .",
    "the advantage of the description based on this model is that it is physically and technically simple and the model itself does not include any fitting parameters ( with the exception of the decay rates which however can not be properly calculated in more sophisticated techniques@xcite ) .",
    "all this makes the model useful for the quantative consideration of the collective behaviour of electrons in more complicated fullerene systems .",
