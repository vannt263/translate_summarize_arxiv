    "among quantum integrable models , the @xmath0 ( bbs)-model @xcite plays a special role for its unique properties , e.g. , it is one of the simplest quantum integrable models associated with cyclic representation of the weyl algebra ; it allows to include multiple inhomogeneity parameters on each single site without breaking the integrability of the model ; and more interestingly , the @xmath0-model under certain parameter constraint is highly related to some other integrable models such as the chiral potts model @xcite and the relativistic quantum toda chain model @xcite .",

    "however , by including an extra off - diagonal term in the @xmath2 relation ( i.e. , the inhomogeneous @xmath2 relation ) , we show that the eigenvalues of the generic @xmath0 transfer matrix can be expressed explicitly in terms of a trigonometric polynomial @xmath3 function and thus a proper set of bethe ansatz equations can be derived .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following .",
    "in the subsequent section , we give a brief introduction of the @xmath0 transfer matrix . in section 3 ,",

    "for generic inhomogeneity parameters @xmath50 satisfying the constraint ( [ constraint-1 ] ) , we know that , as a function of @xmath54 , @xmath105 is a laurent polynomial of degree @xmath106 with the form f_k(u)&=&**(u)+ * * ( u)-e^p_k*|*(u)-e^-p_k*|*(u ) + & = & f_k^(pn)e^pnu+f_k^(p(n-2))e^p(n-2)u++f_k^(-pn)e^-pnu + & = & _ k^(0)_j=1^pn\\{- } , [ f - function - expansion ] where @xmath140 are the zeros of @xmath105 which are all different from each other and the constant @xmath141 is related to the asymptotic behaviors of the function .",
    "the relations ( [ p - periodic ] ) and the definition ( [ bar - a - d - functions ] ) imply that the function @xmath105 actually is a laurent polynomial of @xmath66 with a degree @xmath71 ( i.e. , there are only @xmath56 non - vanishing coefficients in the expansion ( [ f - function - expansion ] ) ) , namely , f_k(u)&=&_l=0^nf_k^(p(n-2l))(\\{d^()_n ,  f^()_n ,  g^()_n ,  h^()_n})e^p(n-2l)u + & & _ l=0^nf_k^(p(n-2l))e^p(n-2l)u,[f - function - expansion-1 ] where the @xmath56 non - vanishing coefficients @xmath142 are polynomials of the inhomogeneity parameters @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , it follows that f_k(z_j)=f_k(z_j+m)=0,m.[zeros ]    let us introduce the function @xmath143 which is given by g(u)= _k^()(u)-**(u)- * * ( u ) -(u-())_k^()(u),[g - function ] where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are given by the determinant representation ( [ eigenvlue-2 ] ) with @xmath98 given by ( [ t - q - relation ] ) . from the above definition",
    ", one knows that the function @xmath143 as a function of @xmath54 is a laurent polynomial of degree @xmath106 of similar form as ( [ f - function - expansion ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath143 is uniquely determined by its @xmath146 points values such as @xmath147 ( or @xmath148 ) and @xmath149 .",
    "thanks to the property ( [ zeros ] ) , we have _k(z_j+m)&=&e^_ka(z_j+m)+e^-_kd(z_j+m ) , + & & m , j=1,,pn.substituting the above relations into ( [ eigenvlue-2 ] ) and noting the fact @xmath150 , after some tedious calculation , we have _k^()(z_j)&=&e^p_k|**(z_j)+e^-p_k |**(z_j ) + ( z_j-())_k^()(z_j ) + & = & * * ( z_j)+ * * ( z_j ) + ( z_j-())_k^()(z_j),j=1,,pn.[a-1 ] in deriving the second equality , we have used the fact : @xmath151 .",
    "then ( [ a-1 ] ) implies that the function @xmath143 vanishes at the points @xmath152 , namely , g(z_j)=0,j=1,,pn.[a-2 ] the baes ( [ bae-2])-([bae-3 ] ) imply that the functions given by the @xmath2 relation ( [ t - q - relation ] ) also satisfy ( [ eigen - asymp ] ) , which give rise to _ ug(u)=0 .

    "imply that @xmath153 .",
    "namely , the inhomogeneous @xmath2 relation ( [ t - q - relation ] ) does satisfy ( [ eigen - truncation ] ) .",
    "therefore we can conclude that @xmath114 given by the @xmath2 relation ( [ t - q - relation ] ) are the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix @xmath47 of the @xmath0-model with periodic boundary condition provided that the @xmath109 parameters @xmath110 and @xmath111 satisfy the baes ( [ bae-1])-([bae-3 ] ) .",
    "some remarks are in order",
    ". due to the fact that @xmath143 given by ( [ g - function ] ) as a function of @xmath54 is a laurent polynomial of degree @xmath106 , the relations g(u)=0 , u = z_1 , , z_pn , + , are already sufficient to ensure @xmath153 .",
    "this implies that the baes ( [ bae-1])-([bae-2 ] ) are sufficient to guarantee that the @xmath2 relation ( [ t - q - relation ] ) satisfy ( [ eigen - periodic ] ) , ( [ eigenvalue - anal ] ) , ( [ eigen - truncation ] ) and ( [ eigen - asymp ] ) with the @xmath154 limit . then the bae ( [ bae-3 ] ) only plays a role of the selection rule such that the @xmath155 behavior also matches .",
    "in this appendix we show that the inhomogeneous @xmath2 relation ( [ t - q - relation ] ) does reduce to the conventional one ( [ t - q relation-2 ] ) ( or ( [ t - q relation-3 ] ) ) when the inhomogeneity parameters satisfy the constraints ( [ constraint-2 ] ) and ( [ constraint-4 ] ) or ( [ constraint-3 ] ) and ( [ constraint-4 ] ) .",
    "suppose that the inhomogeneous @xmath2 relation ( [ t - q - relation ] ) can be reduced to the conventional one , namely , _k(u)=e^_ka(u)+e^-_kd(u ) , [ t - q - relation - b ] where the @xmath3-function is |q(u)=_j=1^m(u - _j),and @xmath135 is a non - negative integer to be specified by ( [ constraint-2 ] ) ( or ( [ constraint-3 ] ) ) . the asymptotic behavior ( [ eigen - asymp ] ) of @xmath98 now becomes & & q^k d^(+ ) + q^-kf^(+ ) - 2\\{d^(+)f^(+)}^ ( _ k + ( - m))=0 , + & & q^-kd^(- ) + q^kf^(- ) - ( -1)^n + & & \\{e^_k + ( + m ) + e^-_k - ( +",
    "m ) } = 0 . only when the inhomogeneity parameters obey the constraint ( [ constraint-2 ] ) or ( [ constraint-3 ] ) ,",
    "there does exist a solution to the above two equations : \\",
    "{      .[b-1 ] it is easy to check that both solutions give rise to @xmath156 . together with ( [ constraint-4 ] )",
    ", we have that in each constrained case ( ( [ constraint-2 ] ) and ( [ constraint-4 ] ) or ( [ constraint-3 ] ) and ( [ constraint-4 ] ) ) the function @xmath105 indeed vanishes , namely , @xmath157 . substituting the solution ( [ b-1 ] ) into ( [ t - q - relation - b ] ) , we obtain the conventional @xmath2 relation ( [ t - q relation-2 ] ) or ( [ t - q relation-3 ] ) respectively .    substituting ( [ t - q relation-2 ] ) into ( [ eigenvlue-2 ] ) and noting the fact @xmath150 , after some tedious calculation , we have _k^()(u)&=&e^p_k|**(u)+e^-p_k |**(u ) + ( u-())_k^()(u ) + & = & * * ( u)+ * * ( u ) + ( u-())_k^()(u).[b-2 ] in deriving the second equality , we have used the fact : @xmath158 when the inhomogeneity parameters @xmath50 satisfy the constraints ( [ constraint-1 ] ) , ( [ constraint-2 ] ) and ( [ constraint-4 ] ) .",
    "similarly we can prove that the reduced @xmath2 relation ( [ t - q relation-3 ] ) satisfies ( [ eigen - asymp ] ) and ( [ eigen - truncation ] ) provided that the inhomogeneity parameters obey the constraints ( [ constraint-1 ] ) , ( [ constraint-3 ] ) and ( [ constraint-4 ] ) .",
