    "the study of the evolution of transition interfaces , which is of paramount importance in many physical / biological phenomena and industrial processes , can be grouped into two macro classes , each one corresponding to a different method of dealing with the moving free - boundary : the sharp interface method and the phase - field method . in the sharp interface approach ,",
    "the free boundary is to be determined together with the solution of suitable partial differential equations where proper jump relations have to imposed across the free boundary . in the phase field approach ,",
    "the interface is specified as the level set of a smooth continuos function exhibiting large gradients across the interface .",
    "phase field models , which date back to the works of korteweg @xcite , cahn and hilliard @xcite , landau and ginzburg @xcite and van der waals @xcite , have been classicaly employed to describe phase separation in binary alloys .",
    "however , recently cahn - hilliard type equations have been extensively used in an impressive variety of applied problems , such as , among the others , tumor growth @xcite , origin of saturn s rings @xcite , separation of di - block copolymers @xcite , population dynamics @xcite , image processing @xcite and even clustering of mussels @xcite .    due to the wide spectrum of applications ,",
    "the study of efficient numerical methods for the approximate solution of the cahn - hilliard equation has been the object of an intensive research activity .",
    "summarizing the achievements in this field is a tremendous task that go beyond the scope of this paper . here , we limit ourvselves to some remarks on finite element based methods , as the main properties ( and limitations ) of these schemes are instrumental to motivate the introduction of our new approach . as",
    "the cahn - hilliard equation is a fourth order nonlinear problem , a natural approach is the use of @xmath0 finite elements ( fem ) as in @xcite .",
    "however , in order to avoid the well known difficulty met in the implementation of @xmath0 finite elements , another possibility is the use of non - conforming ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or discontinuous ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) methods ; the drawback is that in such case the discrete solution will not satisfy a @xmath0 regularity .",
    "alternatively , the most common strategy employed _ in practice _ to solve the cahn - hilliard equation with ( continuos and discontinuous ) finite elements is to use mixed methods ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for the continuous and discontinuous setting , respectively ) . clearly , the drawback of this approach is the increase of the numbers of degrees of freedom , and thus of the computational cost .",
    "very recently , the difficulty related to the practical use of @xmath0 basis functions has been addressed with success also in the framework of isogeometric analysis @xcite .    in this paper , we introduce and analyze the @xmath0 virtual element method ( vem ) for the approximate solution of the cahn - hilliard equation . this newly introduced method ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an introduction to the method and @xcite for the details of its practical implementation ) is characterized by the capability of dealing with very general polygonal / polyedral meshes and to possibility of easily implementing highly regular discrete spaces . indeed ,",
    "by avoiding the explicit construction of the local basis functions , the vem can easily handle general polygons / polyhedrons without complex integrations on the element .",
    "in addition , thanks to this added flexibility , it was discovered @xcite that virtual elements can also be used to build global discrete spaces of arbitrary regularity ( @xmath0 and more ) that are quite simple in terms of degrees of freedom and coding .",
    "other virtual element contributions are , for instance @xcite , while for a very short sample of other fem - inspired methods dealing with general polygons we refer to @xcite .    in the present contribution",
    "we develop a modification of the @xmath0 virtual elements ( of minimal degree ) of @xcite for the approximation of the cahn - hilliard equation . also taking inspiration from the enhancement techniques of @xcite ,",
    "we define the virtual space in order to be able to compute three different projection operators , that are used for the construction of the discrete scheme . afterwards , we prove the convergence of the semi - discrete scheme and investigate the performance of the fully discrete scheme numerically .",
    "we underline that , on our knowledge , this is the first application of the newborn virtual element technology to a nonlinear problem .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we describe the proposed virtual element method . in section [ sec : error ] we develop the theoretical error estimates . in section  [ sec : num ] we present the numerical tests .",
    "in this section , after presenting the cahn - hilliard equation , we introduce the virtual element discretization .",
    "the proposed strategy takes the steps from the @xmath0 methods described in @xcite for the kirchhoff and poisson problems , respectively , combined with an enhancement strategy first introduced in @xcite .",
    "the present virtual scheme makes use of three different projectors and of a particular construction to take care of the nonlinear part of the problem .",
    "let @xmath2 be an open bounded domain .",
    "let @xmath3 and let @xmath4 , we consider the following cahn - hilliard problem : find @xmath5 \\rightarrow { \\mathbb r}$ ] such that : @xmath6 , \\\\ & u(\\cdot , 0 ) = u_0(\\cdot )   & & \\textrm { in } \\omega , \\\\ & \\partial_{\\bf n } u = \\partial_n \\big ( \\phi(u ) -",

    "we will employ the standard notation for sobolev spaces @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the variational form of that will be used to derive the virtual element discretization . to this aim , we preliminary define the following bilinear forms @xmath10 and the semi - linear form @xmath11 where all the symbols above follow a standard notation .",
    "finally , introducing the space @xmath12 the weak formulation of problem reads as : find @xmath13 such that @xmath14 in the theoretical analysis of section [ sec : error ] , we will work under the following regularity assumption on the solution of @xmath15 see , e.g. , @xcite for a possible proof under higher regularity hypotheses on the initial datum @xmath16 .      in the present section",
    "we describe the virtual element space @xmath17 that we will use in the next section to build a discretization of problem . from now on",
    ", we will assume that @xmath18 is a polygonal domain in @xmath19 .",
    "+ our construction will need a few steps .",
    "let @xmath20 represent a decomposition of @xmath18 into general polygonal elements @xmath21 of diameter @xmath22 . in the following",
    ", we will denote by @xmath23 the edges of the mesh @xmath20 and , for all @xmath24 , @xmath25 will denote the unit normal vector to @xmath23 pointing outward to @xmath21 .",
    "we will use the symbol @xmath26 to denote the space of polynomials of degree less than or equal to @xmath27 living on the set @xmath28 .",
    "finally , we will make use of the following local bilinear forms for all @xmath29 @xmath30 given an element @xmath29 , the _ augmented _ local space @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32 ^ 2 , \\partial_{\\bf n } v_{|e } \\in \\p_1(e ) \\ \\forall e \\in \\partial e \\big\\ } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath7 denoting the ( outward ) normal derivative .",
    "the space @xmath31 is made of functions that are continuous and piecewise cubic on the boundary , with continuous gradient on the boundary , normal linear component on each edge and such that its bilaplacian is a quadratic polynomial .",
    "we now introduce two sets @xmath33 and @xmath34 of linear operators from @xmath31 into @xmath35 . for all @xmath36",
    "they are defined as follows :    * contains linear operators evaluating @xmath37 at the @xmath38 vertexes of @xmath21 ; * contains linear operators evaluating @xmath39 at the @xmath38 vertexes of @xmath21 .",
    "note that , as a consequence of definition , the output values of the two sets of operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 are sufficient to uniquely determine @xmath37 and @xmath39 on the boundary of @xmath21 .",
    "let us now introduce the projection operator @xmath40 , defined by @xmath41 for all @xmath36 where @xmath42 represents an euclidean scalar product acting on the function vertex values , i.e. @xmath43 some explanation is in order to motivate the construction of the operator @xmath44 .",
    "first , we note that the bilinear form @xmath45 has a non - trivial kernel , given by @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the role of the second condition in is to select an element of the kernel of the operator .",
    "moreover , it is easy to check that the operator @xmath44 is well defined , as for all @xmath36 it returns one ( and only one ) function @xmath47 .",
    "second , it is crucial to remark that the operator @xmath44 is uniquely determined on the basis of the informations carried by the linear operators in @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , it is sufficient to perform a double integration by parts on the right hand side of , which gives @xmath48 and to observe that the above term on the right hand side only depends on the boundary values of @xmath49 and @xmath39 .",
    "we note that the same holds for the right hand side of the second equation in , since it depends only on the vertex values of @xmath37 . to conclude , as for any @xmath36 , the output values of the linear operators in @xmath33 and @xmath34 are sufficient to define @xmath37 and @xmath39 on the boundary , it turns out that the operator @xmath44 is uniquely determined on the basis of the evaluations performed by the linear operators in @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we are now ready to define our virtual local spaces @xmath50 we observe that , since @xmath51 , the operator @xmath52 is well defined on @xmath53 and computable only on the basis of the output values of the operators in @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    moreover , we have the following result .    the set of operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 constitutes a set of degrees of freedom for the space @xmath53 .",
    "we start by noting that the space @xmath31 is associated to a well posed biharmonic problem on @xmath21 with dirichlet boundary data and standard volume loading , i.e. , @xmath54 thus the dimension of @xmath31 equals the dimension of the data space ( loading and boundary data spaces ) .",
    "we now recall that , as already noted , the operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 uniquely determine @xmath37 and @xmath39 on the boundary of @xmath21 and thus the cardinality @xmath55 exactly corresponds to the dimension of the boundary data in the above biharmonic problem . therefore , since the loading data space has dimension equal to @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 now , we observe that the space @xmath53 is a subspace of @xmath31 obtained by enforcing the constraints in , i.e a set of @xmath58 linear equations , with @xmath59 .",
    "since such equations could , in principle , not be linearly independent , all we can say on the dimension of @xmath53 is @xmath60 the proof is therefore complete if we show that any @xmath61 that vanishes on @xmath33 and @xmath34 is indeed the zero element of @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath61 vanish on @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "first of all , this easily implies that @xmath37 and @xmath39 are null on the boundary @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , since the operator @xmath44 is linear and depends only on the output values of the operators in @xmath33 and @xmath34 , it must hold @xmath63 . recalling definition , this in turn yields @xmath64 since @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 . therefore , we can take @xmath67 as a test function in . a double integration by parts , using also that @xmath37 and @xmath39 are null on @xmath62",
    ", then gives @xmath68 thus @xmath69 and the proof is complete by recalling again the boundary conditions on @xmath37 .",
    "the space @xmath53 satisfies also the following properties .",
    "the first one is that @xmath70 that will guarantee the good approximation properties for the space . the above inclusion is easy to verify , since clearly @xmath71 and the additional condition in is satisfied by @xmath72 polynomials ( being @xmath73 a projection on such polynomial space ) .",
    "the second property is that also the standard @xmath74 projection operator @xmath75 is computable ( only ) on the basis of the values of the degrees of freedom @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "indeed , for all @xmath76 , the function @xmath77 is defined by @xmath78 where the bilinear form @xmath79 , introduced in , represents the @xmath80 scalar product . due to the particular property appearing in definition ,",
    "the right hand side in is computable using @xmath81 , and thus @xmath82 depends only on the values of the degrees of freedom @xmath33 , @xmath34 attained by @xmath37 and @xmath39 . actually , it is easy to check that on the space @xmath53 the projectors @xmath73 and @xmath83 are the same operator ( although for the sake of clarity we prefer to keep the notation different ) .",
    "we introduce an additional projection operator that we will need in the following .",
    "we define @xmath84 by @xmath85 we remark that , since the bilinear form @xmath86 has a non trivial kernel ( given by the constant functions ) we added a second condition in order to keep the operator @xmath87 well defined .",
    "it is easy to check that the right hand side in is computable on the basis of the values of the degrees of freedom @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "for the first equation in , this can be shown with an integration by parts ( similarly as already done for the @xmath44 projector ) @xmath88 and noting that the identity @xmath89 allows to compute the integral of @xmath37 on @xmath21 using only the values of the degrees of freedom @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "for the ease of the reader , we summarize what we have accomplished so far in the following remark .",
    "we have introduced a set of local spaces @xmath53 ( well defined on general polygons and containing @xmath72 ) and the associated local degrees of freedom .",
    "we have moreover shown that we have three different projection operators ( each one associated to a different bilinear form appearing in the problem ) that can be computed making use only of the values of such degrees of freedom .",
    "the global discrete space can now be assembled in the classical finite element fashion , yielding @xmath90 note that , by gluing in the standard way the degrees of freedom , the ensuing functions will have continuous values and continuous gradients across edges .",
    "therefore the resulting space is indeed contained in @xmath91 and will yield a conforming solution .",
    "the _ global degrees of freedom _ will simply be    * evaluation of @xmath37 at the vertexes of the mesh @xmath20 ; * evaluation of @xmath39 at the vertexes of the mesh @xmath20 .",
    "thus the dimension of @xmath92 is three times the number of vertexes in the mesh . as a final note",
    "we observe that , in practice , it is recommended to scale the degrees of freedom @xmath34 by some local characteristic mesh size @xmath93 in order to obtain a better condition number of the final system .",
    "the second key step in the contruction of the method is the definition of suitable discrete forms .",
    "analogously to the finite element case , this forms will be constructed element by element and will depend on the degrees of freedom of the discrete space .",
    "unlike in the finite element case , this forms will not be obtained by some gauss integration of the shape functions ( that are unknown inside the elements ) but rather using the projection operators that we defined in the previous section .",
    "we start by introducing a discrete approximation of the three exact local forms in . by making use of the projection operators of the previous section ,",
    "the development of the bilinear forms follows a standard approach in the virtual element literature .",
    "we therefore refer , for instance , to @xcite for more details and motivations regarding this construction .",
    "let @xmath29 be any element of the polygonal partition .",
    "we introduce the following ( strictly ) positive definite bilinear form on @xmath94 @xmath95 where @xmath93 is some characteristic mesh size lenght associated to the node @xmath96 ( for instance the maximum diameter among the elements having @xmath96 as a vertex ) .    recalling , we then propose the following discrete ( and symmetric ) local forms @xmath97 for all @xmath98 .",
    "the consistency of the discrete bilinear forms is assured by the first term on the right hand side of each relation , while the role of the second term @xmath99 is only to guarantee the correct coercivity properties .",
    "indeed , noting that the projection operators appearing above are always orthogonal with respect to the associated bilinear form , it is immediate to check the following consistency lemma .",
    "[ lem : cons ] for all the three bilinear forms in it holds @xmath100 where the symbol @xmath101 stands for the symbol @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "the lemma above states that the bilinear forms are exact whenever one of the two entries is a polynomial in @xmath72 . in order to present a stability result for the proposed discrete bilinear forms , we need some mesh regularity assumptions on the mesh sequence @xmath104 .    [ meshass ] we assume that there exist positive constants @xmath105 and @xmath106 such that every element @xmath107 is star shaped with respect to a ball with radius @xmath108 and every edge @xmath24 has at least length @xmath109 .    under the above mesh regularity conditions",
    ", we can show the following lemma .",
    "since the proof is standard and based on a scaling argument , it is omitted .",
    "[ lem : stab ] let assumption  [ meshass ] hold .",
    "there exist two positive constants @xmath110 independent of the element @xmath107 such that @xmath111 where the symbol @xmath101 stands for the symbol @xmath102 or @xmath103 .",
    "note that , as a consequence of the above lemma , it is immediate to check that the bilinear forms @xmath112 are continuous with respect to the relevant norm : @xmath1 for @xmath113 , @xmath114 for @xmath115 and @xmath74 for @xmath116 .",
    "the global discrete bilinear forms will be written ( following the classical finite element procedure ) @xmath117 with the usual multiple meaning of the symbol @xmath101 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the semilinear form @xmath118 , that we here write more explicitly : @xmath119 on each element @xmath21 , we approximate the term @xmath120 with its average , computed using the @xmath80 bilinear form @xmath121 : @xmath122 where @xmath123 denotes the area of element @xmath21 .",
    "this approach will turn out to have the correct approximation properties and , moreover , it preserves the positivity of @xmath124 .",
    "we therefore propose the following approximation of the local nonlinear forms @xmath125 where @xmath126 .",
    "the global form is then assembled as usual @xmath127      we here outline the virtual element discretization of problem , that follows a galerkin approach in space combined with a backward euler in time .",
    "let us introduce the space with boundary conditions @xmath128 as usual , it is convenient to first introduce the semi - discrete problem : @xmath129 with @xmath130 a suitable approximation of @xmath16 and where the discrete forms above have been introduced in the previous section . + in order to introduce the fully discrete problem , we subdivide the time interval @xmath131 $ ] into @xmath132 uniform sub - intervals of length @xmath133 by selecting , as usual , the time nodes @xmath134 .",
    "we now search for @xmath135 with @xmath136 representing the solution at time @xmath137 .",
    "the fully discrete problem reads as follows : given @xmath138 , for @xmath139 look for @xmath136 such that @xmath140",
    "throughout the subsequent discussion , we will employ the notation @xmath141 to denote the inequality @xmath142 being @xmath143 a positive constant independent of the discretization parameters but that may depend on the regularity of the underlying continuous solution .",
    "moreover , note that ( unless needed to avoid confusion ) in the sequel the dependence of @xmath144 and @xmath145 on time @xmath146 is left implicit and the bounds involving @xmath144 or @xmath145 hold for all @xmath147 $ ] .",
    "in this section we present the convergence analysis of the semidiscrete virtual element formulation given in .",
    "our theoretical analysis will deal only with the semi - discrete case since the main novelty of the present paper is the ( virtual element ) space discretization .",
    "the error analysis of the fully discrete scheme follows from the analysis of the semi - discrete case employing standard techniques as for in the classical finite element case ( see , e.g , @xcite ) .    the subsequent convergence analysis will be performed under the following well accepted regularity assumption on the semi - discrete solution @xmath145 of ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a discussion on its validity ) .",
