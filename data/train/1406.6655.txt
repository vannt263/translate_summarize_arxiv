    "in particular , paper v @xcite provides a high - level overview of the survey s constraints on statistics of massive binary stars by use of a monte carlo analysis .",
    "stars down to spectral type @xmath10b2.5v are included in the survey because they are expected to dominate the population of supernova progenitors , given typical initial mass functions .",

    "unless there are an disproportionate number of high-@xmath20 systems in cyg  ob2 , the @xmath20 distribution can be described as approximately uniform out to periods of @xmath101000 days .",
    "the distribution of mass ratios among our sample can be recovered , statistically , using monte carlo methods , by assigning randomly chosen inclinations on the unit sphere . in most cases",
    "an upper limit on the inclination is estimated by either the observed eclipse profile or the lack of observed eclipses ; for long - period systems the upper limit on the inclination is effectively 90 .",
    "a lower limit on the inclination is obtained by letting the mass of the secondary approach that of the primary ; the lack of observed spectral features from a secondary star is a weak constraint on this lower bound . for each system",
    "we use the measured orbital period , adopted primary mass , observed velocity amplitude , and a random inclination between the observationally imposed limits to solve for the mass of the secondary star .",
    "the mean value of @xmath30 is then computed after 1000 such iterations for each system .",
    "figure  [ qdist ] shows the resulting histogram of mass ratios .",
    "the overall distribution is approximately uniform .",
    "however , incompleteness appreciably affects the bins at @xmath61 , so the true number of binaries in these bins is highly uncertain .",
    "given the large uncertainties on any individual mass ratio value , we elect not to pursue a statistical analysis of these data . in principle",
    "we could estimate the completeness factor at @xmath62 given assumptions about the functional form of the underlying secondary mass distribution and period distribution ( e.g. , by adopting a power law distribution , following @xcite ) .",
    "however , as we will show below , the true distribution of orbital parameters , in particular the periods , may not be a single power law .",
    "figure  [ pcum1 ] displays the observed cumulative distribution of orbital periods ( in @xmath63 @xmath4 ) for the full sample of 48 massive ( b3 and earlier ) systems in cyg  ob2 ( filled circles ) , o stars from six galactic open clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* plusses ) , and bright o stars drawn from the general galactic population from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* open squares ) .",
    "fiducial marks near the top of the plot indicate the period in days .",
    "other annotations mark the corresponding semi - major axis for the given period , assuming a total system mass of 30 .",
    "the @xcite sample has been normalized by a factor of 1.5 to allow better comparison with the other two surveys in the short - period limit where all three are highly complete .",
    "both the @xcite sample and the cyg  ob2 sample are reasonably complete to periods of several hundred days , while the @xcite sample lacks such longer - period systems  a consequence of the limited observing campaign .",
    "a constant slope in this plot corresponds to a uniform distribution in @xmath63 @xmath4 .",
    "a steeper slope means a larger number of detected binaries per @xmath63 @xmath4 interval than a shallower slope .",
    "the observed cumulative period distributions for the three samples appear remarkably similar at short periods , rising rapidly with similar slope from a short - period limit of about 1.4 days to near 7 days .",
    "an a - d test shows that the cyg  ob2 and @xcite observed distributions have a 91% chance of being drawn from the same parent populations in this range , increasing to 97% if the complete instead of the unbiased cyg  ob2 sample is used .",
    "all three samples show an abundance of short - period binaries , noted previously by @xcite .",
    "all three samples also show a flattening of the slope beginning at about 6 days .",
    "the cyg  ob2 sample exhibits the most pronounced flattening between 6 and 14 days , indicating a paucity of systems in this range , as noted previously by @xcite .",
    "there is then an upturn between 14 and @xmath1045 days , with a slope approximately matching that of the very short - period systems .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite samples , by contrast , show lesser degrees of flattening longward of six days , with the former being steeper than the latter .",
    "the limited number of data points precludes any strong statement regarding the similarity of the three samples in this restricted range , or the reality of the change in slope near six days .",
    "both the cyg  ob2 and the @xcite samples flatten or exhibit a break near 45 d. the @xcite sample has become considerably incomplete at these periods and is not considered further .",
    "both samples exhibit similar slopes out to periods of several thousand days where both become significantly incomplete . @xcite and",
    "@xcite considered the possibility that period distribution could be characterized by a double - pik ( i.e. , uniform in @xmath64 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) distribution with a break near 10 days , however they found that such a description did not provide a better fit to the data .",
    "corrections for observational bias ( i.e. , incompleteness ) become important at periods greater than several hundred days , and we address these in the context of the cyg  ob2 sample below .      a two - sample anderson - darling test shows that the cyg  ob2 and the @xcite observed cumulative distributions are individually consistent with uniform ( in @xmath63 p given by @xmath65 ) between 1.4 and 45 days at the 42% and 45% levels , respectively ; the cyg  ob2 and @xcite samples becomes consistent with uniform at the 86% and 62% level for periods @xmath3425 days .",
    "the cyg  ob2 and @xcite samples are consistent with each other at the 91% levels for @xmath1 25 d but only 19% for @xmath1 45 d. the cyg  ob2 and the @xcite samples are consistent with each other at the 40% and 5% levels for upper period limits of 25 d and 45 d , respectively .",
    "taken together , these statistics indicate that the period distributions in the cyg  ob2 and @xcite surveys are probably consistent with each other @xmath66 d , but not at @xmath67 d and are not consistent with a uniform distribution even at the shortest periods .    when all three surveys are combined , the probability that the combined sample is consistent with uniform drops to 14% and 21% for upper period limits of 25 d and 45 d , respectively .",
    "we interpret this to be evidence for structure in the period distribution that becomes apparent with sufficiently large numbers .",
    "thus , the period distribution does not appear to be scale - free ; it is suggestive of features imposed by physical phenomena occurring during the formation and/or evolution of massive systems .",
    "the most obvious feature in the period distribution at @xmath68 d is the flattening of the slope near 6 days seen in all three datasets .",
    "@xcite characterized this structure as a possible excess of 36 d systems accompanied by a deficit of 714 d systems , observed here as a flattening of the slope of the cumulative distribution over that range in all three samples .",
    "this possible feature seen in the cyg  ob2 distribution is not as obvious in the other two data sets .",
    "incompleteness in @xcite sample , though not explicitly quantified in that work , probably begins in the 1530 d range and could easily mask such a signal if it were present .",
    "by contrast , the completeness of the cyg  ob2 survey is @xmath1190% for @xmath4@xmath3410 d. the reality of such a signal in the @xcite sample is uncertain owing to the small number of points between 6 d and 45 d ( 10 systems ) , even though the sample is likely to be similarly complete .",
    "we conclude that the cyg  ob2 period data is not convincingly consistent with uniform ( a single power law of slope zero ) at @xmath4@xmath3445 d. there is evidence for structure in the form of a 36 d period  excess  and the 614 d period `` deficit '' that becomes more pronounced when the three samples are combined .    in the period range",
    "60  4000 d the cyg  ob2 and @xcite samples , as observed , are consistent with uniform at the 94% and 55% levels .",
    "the two samples are consistent with each other at the 99% level . by contrast , over the full period range 1.4  5000 days , both samples are inconsistent with uniform , having a @xmath340.01% chance of being drawn from such a distribution .",
    "the single @xmath65 power law is a poor description of the observed period distribution over the full range , but observational biases against detection of long - period systems must be considered before strong conclusions may be drawn .",
    "figure  [ pcum2 ] ( lower panel ) shows the observed cumulative period distribution for the unbiased sample of 45 systems as observed ( filled symbols ) and after correction for completeness ( open symbols ) as described by completeness curve in figure  [ complete ] using the solid line representing the 15  ( most conservative ) detection threshold .",
    "the y - axis is now scaled to indicate the fraction of the total number of stars in the unbiased cyg  ob2 sample .",
    "the correction from observed to underlying period distribution is performed by tabulating the cumulative incompleteness ( 1-completeness ) at the location of each observed system , n , starting from the shortest periods , and inserting an additional `` system '' when the cumulative incompleteness reaches an integer value ; systems are added at periods halfway between the period of system n and n-1 .",
    "this can result in the appearance of two or more systems plotted at the same orbital period when the completeness is low ( i.e. , for long periods ) .",
    "open symbols in figure  [ pcum2 ] trace a curve similar to the filled symbols until the correction for completeness becomes a large factor beyond about 2000 days .",
    "the difference between the filled and open symbols is small for periods less than a few hundred days but approaches 20% at the 5000-day limit of the survey .",
    "the open symbols display an apparent change in slope near 45 days , indicating that the putative break in the cumulative distribution is not likely to be caused by observational biases . under the adopted prescriptions for the mass ratio distribution ( i.e. , uniform ) and the eccentricity distribution ( i.e. , uniform ) adopted in the monte carlo modeling",
    ", this figure shows that the binary fraction reaches 30% by @xmath4=45 d. fifty - five percent of the systems are binaries with periods less than 5000 days .",
    "this is nearly identical to the binary fraction of 51% computed for o stars in the large magellanic cloud @xcite and may indicate that the binarity characteristics of massive stars are insensitive to metallicity .",
    "an extrapolation of the quasi - linear trend defined by systems with @xmath5100 days would suggest a binary fraction near 70% for systems with periods less than @xmath69 days . on the other hand , a naive extrapolation of the much steeper slope at @xmath145 days would reach a binary fraction of 100% near @xmath69 days .",
    "we used the a - d test to quantify the probability of a change in slope of the completeness - corrected cumulative period distribution by comparing it to a hypothetical uniform ( i.e. , linear ) distribution in a moving window of encompassing seven observed systems .",
    "window widths of five to nine do not appreciably change the results .",
    "figure  [ pcum2 ] ( upper panel ) plots the probability that the completeness - corrected period distribution is consistent with uniform .",
    "the probability drops below 1% ( 2.6@xmath70 , shown by the dotted horizontal line ) in the vicinity of the hypothesized 45-day break .",
    "the low probability near six days and 14 days supports the hypothesis of a change slope near these locations as well .",
    "the similarity of the cyg  ob2 and the @xcite observed cumulative distribution slopes above 45 days in figure  [ pcum1 ] is noteworthy as is the apparent flattening near 45 days ( @xmath20.9 a.u ) .",
    "the shallower slope above 45 d may indicate either a decreasing binary fraction for systems with semi major axes of @xmath111 a.u .",
    "alternatively , it may indicate a change in the distribution of secondary star masses toward a preference for lower masses .",
    "we interpret the evidence for structure in the cumulative period distribution as an indication that the processes responsible for setting massive binary separations are not scale - free .",
    "nevertheless , we investigated whether a single power law might at least approximate the data .",
    "the solid curve in the lower panel of figure  [ pcum2 ] is a best - fit single @xmath71 power law to the completeness - corrected data over the range 1.42000 d. the completeness correction is highly uncertain beyond 2000 d , so we do not consider this regime in the fit .",
    "an a - d test indicates a 24% probability that the data is drawn from such a single power - law distribution .",
    "this probability does not constitute strong evidence in favor of this particular power law , especially given that the results are sensitive to the magnitude of the completeness corrections required for long - period systems . nevertheless , the @xmath3 power law is not an unreasonable _ approximation _ over 3.3 orders of magnitude in period ( 1.4 days to 2000 days ) , even if it does not describe the fine details of the distribution at a statistically compelling level of significance .",
    "we conclude by noting that the agreement between the observed orbital period distributions of the cyg  ob2 sample , where ob stars formed across an extent of nearly 50 pc , compared to the @xcite sample from several young galactic clusters , suggests that the large - scale physical environment does not determine the orbital parameters of massive binaries formed therein .",
    "this stands in contrast to suggestions that the binary fraction depends on local stellar density , being lower in the densest regions @xcite .",
    "rather , the small - scale physics of cloud collapse and fragmentation on the sub - a.u . scale appear more important in establishing the high fraction of binaries among massive stars and their mass ratio distribution which clearly shows that massive stars preferentially have massive companions .",
    "the results of the massive star surveys stand in stark contrast to those from radial velocity surveys of solar - type stars where the distribution of periods is log - normal with a mean of 180 years @xcite .",
    "the inflections in the cumulative period distribution near 0.2 a.u . and near 0.9 a.u .",
    "are suggestive of key physical size scales beyond which the formation of close massive binaries becomes less efficient .",
    "the addition of 23 new massive binary orbital solutions presented herein raises the total number known in the cygnus ob2 association to 48 .",
    "this is the largest collection of complete solutions obtained within a single environment and constitutes a substantial fraction of all early type orbits published to date .",
    "at least 35% of massive systems in cyg  ob2 are binary or higher - order multiples , with several more long - period or highly eccentric systems expected to be discovered .",
    "the number of unobserved high - inclination or extreme - mass - ratio systems has been modeled statistically .",
    "these computations suggests that the true binary fractions are near 55% for periods",
    "@xmath725000 d , nearly identical to the results from o stars in the lmc , suggesting a degree of metallicity independence .",
    "extrapolation to longer periods suggests binary fractions in the range 6580% for periods @xmath73 d.    the distribution of orbital periods is described as approximately uniform in @xmath0 between the short - period limit of 1.2 d and @xmath245 d , but there is evidence for structure in this distribution , with an excess of 36 d systems and a possible dearth of 714 d systems , along with a break near 45 days . between 45 d and the long - period survey limit of @xmath105000 d",
    "the distribution is also approximately uniform , but with either a lower binary fraction or a population of secondary masses favoring lower - mass companions compared to the 145  d subsample .",
    "no single power - law distribution describes the period data at a statistically significant level .",
    "a single power law of slope @xmath71 also provides a rough description of the cumulative period distribution between 1.4 and @xmath102000 d if structure in the distribution is ignored .",
    "the statistical power of even the present completeness - corrected sample has not yielded a convincing power - law or other analytic description of the present - day binary period distribution .",
    "it seems likely that evolutionary effects such as period migration and stellar mergers have altered the primordial distributions to the ones observed as the present - day distributions in the 34 myr old cygnus ob2 association and other young o - star cluster .",
    "such evolutionary effects may occur during the pre - main - sequences phases , rendering any simple primordial distribution unobservable even in principle .",
    "one goal of this work is to provide a robust measure of massive binary parameters to help inform stellar population synthesis models , including those used to predict cosmic rates of high - energy phenomena such as supernova and @xmath12-ray bursts .",
    "it is our hope that such models may now be grounded more solidly in the data .",
    "this compilation may also prove helpful in guiding models of massive star formation and evolution by providing observational constraints on the binary frequency and distribution of periods and mass ratios among early - type systems .",
    "we expect that there are several more discoverable binary ( and multiple ) systems among the survey targets , but this present compilation likely contains the vast majority of systems discoverable using radial velocity techniques .",
    "insightful comments from an expert anonymous referee greatly improved this manuscript .",
