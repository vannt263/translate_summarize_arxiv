    "synchronization of coupled oscillators is important and has been widely studied in variety of systems from physics , chemistry and biology @xcite .",
    "partially locked states are states of imperfect synchronization with locked subpopulation and drifting subpopulation , and have been observed in coupled oscillators with distributed intrinsic frequencies @xcite .",
    "the formation of locked subpopulation with the increase of the coupling strength is one of the explanations for the transition between asynchronous states and synchronous states . in these cases ,",
    "partial locking is due to the inhomogeneity in intrinsic frequencies .",
    "for some oscillators , the coupling strength is strong enough to make the oscillators locked to the coupling force by overcoming the desynchronizing effect of frequency difference , but for others it is not strong enough and they drift .    however , there can be desynchronizing factors other than ones intrinsic to uncoupled oscillators .",
    "recent studies of networks of real systems show connection topology and coupling strength can be far from homogeneous @xcite . especially , in many real systems including the world - wide web , the internet , social and biological networks , the number of connections per node or the total coupling strength per node follows scale - free distribution ( or power - law distribution ) @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that the inhomogeneity in coupling can induce asynchronous states or make synchronization harder to achieve @xcite .    in this paper , we study the dynamics of oscillators with coupling strength which has a scale - free distribution .",

    "in contrast to the previously studied partially locked states in systems with distributed intrinsic frequencies , the partially locked states due to coupling inhomogeneity can be bistable with synchronous states . using a self - consistency argument",
    ", we analytically obtain various values of the partially locked states .",
    "to focus on the coupling inhomogeneity effect , we consider systems of coupled identical limit cycle oscillators with same type of coupling . in the case of weak coupling , the systems can be reduced to the following phase - only ones @xcite .",

    "we can see more of the similarity in the next section through analysis and simulation .",

    "kuramoto used self - consistency arguments and derived an equation for the order parameter @xmath32 to analyze his model in which oscillators with distributed frequencies are globally coupled @xcite .",
    "the idea is to calculate the order parameter by calculating the contribution from locked subpopulation and from drifting subpopulation in stationary states .",

    "we use the same self - consistency argument here to analyze our system . in this case",
    "@xmath32 is the same for all the oscillators as in the kuramoto model , but the coupling term is different for each oscillator as in chimera states because of the dependency of the term on the coupling strength @xmath13 .",
    "this inhomogeneity in the coupling terms causes the splitting of the population into two groups - locked group and drifting group .",
    "we follow the same argument for the analysis of chimera states described in detail in ref .",
    "the main difference is that coupling strength distribution @xmath24 is used instead of coupling kernel and the order parameter @xmath32 is the same for all oscillators in our case .",
