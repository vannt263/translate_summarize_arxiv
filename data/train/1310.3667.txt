    "density gradients are a necessary feature of confined plasmas and are also common in natural systems .",
    "the inhomogeneity is a source of free energy , which can amplify naturally occurring plasma oscillations and lead to turbulence and transport of particles , energy and momentum .",
    "it is therefore no surprise that density driven instabilities , i.e. unstable drift - waves , were the subject of intense theoretical research in plasma physics since its very beginning .",
    "the controversial story of the so called `` universal '' instability started with the pioneering work by krall and rosenbluth @xcite , which first identified it in a slab with a shearless magnetic field and in an electrostatic collisionless regime ( the drive was electron wave - particle resonances coupled with the density gradient ) .",
    "the same authors introduced in a later paper @xcite the effect of the magnetic shear , which turned out to be a very efficient mechanism to stabilize the mode in experimental conditions . in the following years , it was suggested that the instability could still manifest in a sheared geometry as a transient effect @xcite , i.e. not as a normal eigenmode .",
    "these so called convective modes were described as wave packets which initially grow in amplitude when they are in the region of local instability ( close to the resonant surface ) , but eventually decay as they move in the stable region , coherently with the overall stability of the system .",
    "coming back to the normal eigenmodes , the mathematical framework of the problem was significantly complicated by the magnetic shear @xcite , since the derivation of the dispersion relation now required the solution of a differential equation ( the magnetic shear prevents the use of fourier transforms in the cross filed direction ) .",
    "this implies that proper boundary conditions must be imposed in order to find the correct result . in @xcite , and in all the following collisionless works ,",
    "the ion landau damping was not explicitly treated but it was assumed to stabilize the mode far away from its resonant surface . indeed , the landau damping is more effective for modes with a large parallel wave number , which is proportional to the cross field distance from the rational surface .",
    "the boundary conditions for the `` universal '' instability must therefore allow a smooth connection between the region where the landau damping is neglected and the region where it is important .",
    "it is with this argument that perlstein and berk @xcite challenged the results in @xcite , where the eigenmodes were assumed to decay to zero sufficiently far away from the resonant surface ( i.e. at the _ entrance _ of the landau damping region ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite sustained that the correct boundary conditions should allow for `` outgoing waves '' which would transport their energy outwards where it would eventually be dissipated by wave - particle interactions .",
    "this simple correction led to a new dispersion relation predicting unstable normal eigenmodes ( more unstable than the convective modes ) , thus resurrecting the `` universal '' instability .",
    "ten years later , two independent groups @xcite came to the conclusion that the electron dynamics was not properly treated in @xcite ( the principal part of the plasma dispersion function was not included , an inheritance from @xcite ) . with `` outgoing waves '' and the complete electron response , under no condition normal eigenmodes",
    "could be found in the sheared slab .",
    "these results led to the apparent conclusion that the `` universal '' instability was not so universal after all .    with the realization that the collisionless `` universal '' mode is stable in sheared magnetic fields ,",
    "the only piece of physics missing was the effect of the collisions , which was studied in @xcite .",
    "this was done on the basis that , in drift wave dynamics , dissipative effects in the collisional regime play a destabilizing role similar to resonant electron - wave interactions in the collisionless regime @xcite . in these papers",
    "the approach is completely fluid ( no wave - particle interactions ) , an `` outgoing wave '' boundary condition is used and the problem was solved with both perturbative techniques ( separating the resistive layer from the outer solution ) and wkb methods .",
    "the surprising result was that the resistivity increases even further the stability of the system .",
    "however , other effects such as toroidicity @xcite or coupling to trapped electrons @xcite can overcome the magnetic shear stabilization and produce linearly unstable modes .",
    "in addition , drift waves can be metastable and sustain turbulence through non linear coupling @xcite .",
    "the work that we present is an ideal continuation of this line of research .",
    "in particular , we describe how wave reflection in a finite size system can destabilize the resistive `` universal '' instability . differently from the standard calculations , the boundary conditions that we use could be interpreted as an overlapping of `` outgoing '' and `` ingoing '' waves which create an unstable standing wave in the plasma .",
    "our analysis is performed in the framework of a linearised reduced two fluid model in which finite resistivity is included and wave particle interactions are neglected . both our model and some of the analytical techniques that we use have similarities with those employed in @xcite , although the final conclusions are opposite ( because of different boundary conditions ) .",
    "the most straightforward application of our results is to numerical simulations , which are intrinsically bounded systems .",
    "also periodicity in the cross field direction , a common boundary condition in codes , would entrap energy and produce the unstable standing wave that we describe below .",
    "in addition , our boundary conditions might also be compatible with the energy exchange that occurs between coupled resonant surfaces in toroidal geometry @xcite , so that the results of our simple slab analysis could have counterparts in realistic plasmas .",
    "we investigate a reduced electrostatic two - fluid model , with isothermal electrons , cold ions and valid for small but finite @xmath0 .",

    "_ @xcite and are consistent with those employed in previous studies of the `` universal '' instability @xcite .",

    "both coordinates are normalized with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "the time is normalized with respect to the alfven time , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is a characteristic density and @xmath24 is the ion mass ) .",
    "more details on the normalizations and on the physics described by the different terms can be found in @xcite .",
    "note that our model is an extension of the well known hasegawa - wakatani equations @xcite , that are retrieved in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "in other words , with respect to @xcite , we treat the parallel compressibility in the density equation in a more complete way , allowing the coupling with the parallel ion velocity .    assuming that the perturbations can be expressed in the form , @xmath26 , and linearizing the equations we obtain : @xmath27 where : @xmath28 and the prime symbol represents derivation with respect to @xmath19 . in the last equation , we have introduced the electron diamagnetic frequency ( normalized to the alfven frequency , @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
    "this quantity describes the equilibrium density gradient ( assumed to be locally constant ) through the length scale @xmath32 ( remember that @xmath33 represents derivation with respect to the _ normalized _ radial coordinate ) .",
    "the normalized diamagnetic frequency is another dimensionless parameter , which controls the dynamics of the system together with the other three introduced above .",
    "note also that all the quantities with a hat symbol are further normalized with respect to @xmath34 .",
    "this notation will be dropped in the following but @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 should always be assumed thus normalized unless otherwise stated .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be sheared so that the equilibrium component of @xmath38 depends on @xmath19 and it vanishes at @xmath39 [ @xmath40 around the resonant surface , using a taylor expansion ] , while @xmath41 is a constant .",
    "this also implies that the parallel wave number of the perturbation is given by : @xmath42 since @xmath43 and @xmath44 is taken to be an ignorable direction .",
    "the problem [ 7]-[9 ] is completely defined only when the boundary conditions are imposed , which , as discussed in the introduction , can strongly affect the final result . while the `` outgoing wave '' boundary conditions would require a solution that carries energy outwards , we impose that the wave is completely reflected at a finite distance @xmath45 from either side of the resonant surface , which is equivalent to setting @xmath46 . therefore , the energy does not leak out of the system , not differently from a configurations with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath19 ( which would lead to very similar conclusions as discussed in the appendix ) .",
    "we solved eqs.[7]-[9 ] in various limits in order to clarify the effect of the different terms . in some cases , it is possible to obtain an exact solution of the problem , while in others , the solution can only be found by making use of small parameters and applying perturbative techniques .    for convenience , and similarly to @xcite ,",
    "the potential @xmath47 is rewritten in the following form : @xmath48 with : @xmath49      to introduce the problem , we first study the dispersion relation in the limit of zero magnetic shear .",
    "this can be done by assuming a constant parallel wavelength , @xmath50 .",
    "this approximation removes all the radial dependencies from the equilibrium coefficients of the equations , thus allowing a fourier transformation also in the @xmath19 direction .",
    "the problem becomes scalar and trivial to solve once @xmath19 is replaced by @xmath51 and @xmath52 by @xmath53 in eqs.[7 ] and [ 9 ] .",
    "the dispersion relation is : @xmath54 where @xmath55 . in order to find a simple solution of this equation , we assume @xmath56 , and we expand in this small parameter , so that @xmath57 , with @xmath58 of order @xmath35 .",
    "this gives : @xmath59 where the solution with the plus sign in eq.[9c ] describes a resistive instability driven by the density gradient .",
    "note that in the case @xmath60 we recover the standard drift waves , while for @xmath61 we find sound waves .",
    "equation [ 9a ] has a third solution , which is singular for @xmath62 , but it is stable and therefore not interesting .",
    "the growth rate in eq.[9c ] gives some insight on the nature of the instabilities we discuss in this paper .",
    "they are resistive ( for @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) and driven by the density gradients ( through @xmath37 ) .",
    "the same features are observed also in the presence of magnetic shear , as the following sections show .",
    "at low temperature @xmath66 and @xmath0 are small and they can be neglected in eq.[9 ] so that : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are evaluated at @xmath25 . in this limit ,",
    "eq.[7 ] coupled with eq.[11 ] has an exact solution in terms of whittaker functions @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are complex integration constants",
    ".    modes with even and odd parity with respect to @xmath19 are characterized by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "the first condition corresponds to : @xmath76 while the second gives : @xmath77 imposing also the reflecting boundary condition , we obtain the dispersion relation @xmath78 , where the plus and minus signs are for odd and even modes , respectively . in the limit of small resistivity , @xmath79 ,",
    "this simplifies to : @xmath80 .",
    "we use now approximate relations to find the zeros of the bessel function @xcite , obtaining the dispersion relation : @xmath81 , with @xmath82 and the usual parity convention for the plus and minus sign . using the definition of @xmath83",
    ", we find : @xmath84 where we have used the fact that @xmath85 implies that @xmath86 and therefore @xmath87 . in the previous expressions , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the growth rate of the mode and its rotation frequency .",
    "equation [ 31 ] shows that , in the spectrum , the unstable eigenvalues are located on a curve that does not depend on the resistivity , but only on the diamagnetic frequency .",
    "consequently , also the growth rate of the fastest growing mode depends only on @xmath37 : @xmath90 .",
    "note also that both even and odd modes lie on the same curve , described by eq.[31 ] .",
    "finally , it is important to remark that the complex frequency of the single modes retains a dependency on @xmath35 and their growth rate vanishes in the zero resistivity limit ( when all the modes collapse on the point @xmath91=[0,-\\omega_*]$ ] ) or in the infinite resistivity limit ( when all the modes collapse on the point @xmath91=[0,0]$ ] ) .      for @xmath63 eqs.[35b]-[35f ]",

    ", the condition @xmath93 translates into @xmath94 so that the mode either rotates , but does not grow , or vice versa .",
    "the condition on @xmath95 , analogous to eq.[32 ] , would give : @xmath96 as the right - hand side of the previous equation is negative defined , the only acceptable solution is @xmath97 , which leads to @xmath98 and implies no growing modes .",
    "this result implies that in the fluid limit the resistivity is a key ingredient to destabilize the modes discussed in this paper .",
    "a proper investigation of the effect of finite system size in collisionless regimes would require a kinetic treatment which is beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "as suggested by the previous sections , a finite resistivity is essential to produce unstable modes in finite size fluid systems .",
    "this contrasts with earlier analytic results @xcite , which used outgoing wave boundary conditions and predicted stability and even a damping due to @xmath35 . we now want to asses the properties of the unstable modes when all the physics is included in the problem",
    "unfortunately , in this case an exact solution of eq.[7]-[9 ] is not available . on the other hand , an asymptotic matching approach , similar to the one used in @xcite , provides an approximate solution .",

    "it is also interesting to note that small @xmath1 even and odd modes can invert their stabilization trend and form a second unstable branch with relatively small growth rate ( especially for the even modes ) but less effected by the magnetic shear ( see the odd @xmath218 mode in fig.[fig4 ] ) .     for the the same parameters as fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the mode numbers go from 0 to 14 for the even modes and from 1 to 15 for the odd and increase from the bottom curve to the upper.,height=302 ]    in general , as @xmath154 is increased and the even modes approach their marginally stable state , their rotation frequency matches the diamagnetic frequency , as can be seen in fig.[fig4b ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the second unstable branch described above is associated to quickly rotating modes with @xmath219 , and has therefore a different character .",
    "the situation is different for the odd modes , which do not stabilize at a specific rotation frequency .",
    "on the other hand , also the odd modes enter the second unstable branch when their frequency is higher than @xmath220 .     as a function of @xmath212 and @xmath1 .",
    "the five slices correspond to different @xmath216.,height=302 ]     for odd modes.,height=302 ]    figure [ fig6 ] and [ fig6b ] show contour plots of @xmath202 for the even and odd modes as a function of @xmath221 and @xmath154 for @xmath222 and five values of @xmath216 . only contour levels for @xmath223",
    "are plotted , so that the upmost line in each slice marks the marginally stable conditions .",
    "these figures reveal that the shear stabilization is more efficient at larger @xmath216 .",
    "both small and large @xmath1 perturbations ( i.e. small and large @xmath224 ) are more effectively damped than intermediate mode numbers .",
    "in addition , the mode numbers of the most resilient modes shift to larger values as @xmath216 increases .",
    "note also that the windows of shear destabilization discussed above occur only for the even modes and that are more effective for @xmath225 and less significant for smaller and larger values of @xmath216 .",
    "the new branch of the odd modes is clearly displayed in the low @xmath1 region of fig.[fig6b ] , where it becomes more prominent as @xmath216 is increased .     as a function of @xmath154 and @xmath216 .",
    "the squares represent the vales for @xmath201 and are compared with the theoretical curve shown as a dash - dotted line ( see text ) .",
    "the circles mark the stabilization threshold and are interpolated by eq.[72 ] .",
    "all the curves at different @xmath216 are projected on the @xmath226 plane for easier comparison.,height=302 ]     for the odd modes .",
    "the circles are interpolated by eq.[73],height=302 ]    it is interesting to determine the behaviour of the most unstable mode as a proxy of the overall stability of the equilibrium . in figs.[fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] we plot @xmath227 as a function of @xmath154 and @xmath216 for the even and odd modes . in the plane @xmath201",
    "we have added a dashed line representing the theoretical predictions given at the end of secs.[small_res ] and [ small_res_even ] , finding in both cases a good agreement . for the even modes , the maximum growth rate shows an approximately linear decay as a function of @xmath154 , while for the odd modes the damping is well represented by a cubic function . to facilitate the comparison between these curves , we duplicated them on the @xmath226 plane .",
    "the critical @xmath154 for the complete stabilization of the modes as a function of the system size is well represented with a power law decay . in particular",
    ", we find that our numerical results are well matched by : @xmath228 for the even modes and : @xmath229 for the odd modes .",
    "note the relatively weak exponent in both expressions , suggesting that the critical value remains significant even in large systems .",
    "these two expressions are probably the most important result of the present work as they suggest that the unconditional drift wave stability obtained in @xcite is exclusive to infinite systems in which all the energy is dispersed through the boundary conditions .",
    "equations [ 72 ] and [ 73 ] and the numerical data they represent are plotted in the @xmath230 plane of figs.[fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .",
    "in all the limits discussed , a combination of density gradients , finite resistivity and finite system size can destabilize a spectrum of unstable modes .",
    "the effect of the magnetic shear is generally stabilizing , although relatively small values of it can make some of the modes more unstable ( this effect never occurs for the fastest growing mode ) .",
    "the destabilization is due to the fact that the reflecting boundary conditions that we are imposing trap the energy of the waves .",
    "the same effect would therefore occur in periodic configurations , which are often used in numerical simulations ( see the appendix ) .",
    "it is not uncommon to find in literature works that employ numerical domains of a few tens of @xmath66 and relatively small @xmath154 , compatible with a significant spectrum of unstable modes .",
    "one example is @xcite in which turbulence is driven by the nonlinear version of the modes presents here .",
    "our work suggests that reflecting or periodic boundary conditions can destabilize or enhance the growth rate of the drift waves and therefore affect the anomalous transport estimated in numerical simulations .",
    "a real plasma , however , is an open system in which the energy is , in principle , not bounded to a specific region .",
    "nevertheless , the destabilizing mechanism that we described could play a role in a number of realistic situations .",
    "for example , plasma inhomogeneities can reflect part of the energy back to its source ( i.e. the resonant surface ) , similarly to what would happen to a pulse travelling in a rope consisting of two sections of different thickness . as the reflection would not be perfect",
    ", we expect that the calculations we presented would describe the worst case scenario ( i.e. the highest limit for the growth rate ) .",
    "in addition , in toroidal systems , different poloidal modes are connected with each other through curvature coupling .",
    "this would allow modes that resonate at different positions to exchange energy so that an outgoing wave emitted on one resonant surface might look like an ingoing wave for a neighbouring surface , as originally proposed by taylor @xcite . using this picture ,",
    "our calculations in the simpler and more intuitive slab geometry helps to clarify the mechanism which destabilizes drift waves in toroidal configurations @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath45 would represent the distance between two resonant surfaces .",
    "it is important to notice that , for the instability to occur , the energy reflection must take place before the wave reaches the region where the ion landau damping is strong .",
    "this region is characterized by the requirement that @xmath231 , where @xmath232 and @xmath233 is the ion thermal velocity ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the nature of the problem is therefore determined by the length scale @xmath234 and the condition @xmath235 is necessary for instability .",
    "note that assuming @xmath236 , we have that @xmath237 . in the particular case of cold ions treated in this paper @xmath238 , thus assuring that our calculation is consistent .    in our model ,",
    "the role played by the resistivity is non trivial .",
    "indeed , it is essential in order to drive the unstable modes and appears in the equations in the form of a singular perturbation . in this respect ,",
    "the unstable drift waves we discussed are similar to the resistive tearing modes @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the resistivity can also provide a dissipation mechanism and , if too large , it can even damp the perturbations . as noticed at the end of section [ seciva ] , in the @xmath239 regime the growth rate vanishes for both @xmath63 and @xmath240 .",
    "the damping effect becomes also visible in the case of infinite systems , such as those examined in @xcite , where the resistivity is stabilizing the modes .",
    "our work is limited by the fact that we used a simple fluid model .",
    "finite larmor radius effects are restricted by the conditions @xmath241 and for @xmath242 so that the modes analysed are correctly described if their mode number is relatively small .",
    "electron inertia is neglected , together with electron wave particle interactions .",
    "this prevents us from properly treating collisionless regimes which , within our model are stable but might become unstable upon reintroduction of these effects .",
    "the calculation is electrostatic an approximation that is not justified in the edge region of the fusion devices @xcite .",
    "interesting physics might occur when tearing modes are coupled to the modes described in this paper .",
    "in particular , we expect density driven ( not current driven ) magnetic islands , resulting from the electromagnetic version of the odd parity modes ( which would have even electromagnetic flux at the resonant surface ) .",
    "this @xmath243 independent modes might be related to the microtearing modes .",
    "this problem will be addressed and discussed in a subsequent article .",
    "we investigated the linear stability of finite size resistive inhomogeneous plasmas in a fluid approximation .",
    "the eigenmodes of the unstable drift waves , or universal instabilities , that we have analysed are standing waves generated by the reflective boundary conditions that are applied at a finite distance from the resonant surface .",
    "the study of the effect of these boundary conditions on the stability of the equilibrium was the main scope of the work presented .",
    "we found that the wave reflection provides a robust destabilization mechanism , which can persist also in relatively large systems .",
    "the general dispersion relation characterising the modes was given in eq.[61 ] .",
    "this expression , however , is difficult to interpret and requires simplifications in order to make its physics more transparent .",
    "four dimensionless parameter , @xmath244 , @xmath154 , @xmath245 and @xmath216 , govern the problem and determine the complex frequency of the modes .",
    "several limits of eq.[61 ] were investigated by exploiting the smallness of some of the above mentioned parameters .",
    "in particular , we were able to find exact analytic solutions in the regime @xmath246 , which were reported in eqs.[31 ] and [ 32 ] and in the regime @xmath247 , described in eqs.[35 ] .",
    "these simple studies allowed us to determine that the system can indeed be unstable when is bounded at a finite distance @xmath45 and that its drive mechanism is the density gradient , combined by a finite resistivity .",
    "it is important to notice that , the in the limit @xmath248 , eq.[61 ] correctly becomes the dispersion relation derived in @xcite for infinite systems with outgoing wave boundary conditions , which predicts stability .    for small but finite values of @xmath169 , eq.[61 ] becomes eq.[63a ] and eq.[62a ] for even and odd instabilities respectively .",
    "these expressions are still implicit in the complex frequency and the stabilization and destabilization mechanisms are difficult to identify . finally , by taking their limit for small @xmath154 we arrived to eq.[62d ] and eq.[68 ] which describe a spectrum of unstable odd and even modes .",
    "the important effect of the magnetic shear could not be cast in a simple analytic form ( but it is rigorously contained in eqs.[63a ] and [ 62 ] ) and we therefore resorted to a numerical characterisation ( sec.[fbn ] ) . in particular , we found that the growth rate of the most unstable mode is reduced by a finite magnetic shear , the critical value of which is finite and depends on the position of the wave reflection ( see eqs.[72 ] and [ 73 ] ) .",
    "this is probably our most important result as it shows that unconditional stability is a peculiar feature of the infinite systems and is not reproduced in more general configurations .    under the condition that the at least partial wave reflection occurs before the mode",
    "can be damped by wave - particle interactions , we therefore expect to find unstable modes driven by density gradients in the presence of finite ( albeit relatively small ) magnetic shear . in other words ,",
    "our conclusion is that the universal instability can exist in realistic plasmas and definitely in numerical simulations .",
