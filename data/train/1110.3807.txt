    "therefore , lorentzian lines are expected to be observed well before the lc peak for type iin lsne .",
    "the lc evolution of type ii lsne is also consistent with our models .",
    "in our models for both type iin and type iil lsne , the forward shock stays in the dense wind until the lc peak . as the wind with @xmath64 is shocked with the timescale of @xmath48 , the dense wind adiabatically cools down after the lc peak .",
    "thus , the lcs of type ii lsne are supposed to follow the shell - shocked diffusion model presented by @xcite .",

    "however , it should be noted that the model is too simplified and many effects which can not be treated by the formulation of @xcite are ignored in the model .",
    "for example , the model assumes a constant opacity and it ignores the presence of a recombination wave which is supposed to be created in the diffusing shocked shell .",

    "@xmath45 of both @xmath97 and @xmath102 models are almost consistent with those estimates .",
    "lack of the lorentzian h balmer lines before the lc peak is another important difference between type iil lsn 2008es and type iin lsn 2006gy . for the case of the flat density slope , the wind optical depth remains to be very large until the forward shock reaches the wind surface ( figure [ fig4 ] ) .",

    "for the case of the shock breakout inside the dense wind @xmath25 , the lorentzian spectral lines might be able to be observed just before the lc peak when a suitable optical depth is realized .",

    "this configuration corresponds to the shock breakout at the surface and exactly the same as what is suggested by @xcite .",
    "an important difference between our treatment of the shock breakout in a dense wind from those of the previous works is that we adopt equation ( [ breakout ] ) for the shock breakout condition instead of equation ( [ tsb ] ) .",
    "if we use equation ( [ tsb ] ) , the differences caused by the different density slopes are missed .",
    "for example , with equation ( [ tsb ] ) , we do not expect to see narrow spectral lines from the dense wind after the lc peak of all lsne with shock breakout in the dense wind and they are all expected to be observed as type iil sne .",
    "this is because the forward shock is regarded to go through the entire wind at the lc peak in equation ( [ tsb ] ) .",
    "the different density slope in the dense wind is naturally expected to be caused by the non - steady mass loss of the progenitor just before the explosion . if type iil lsne are actually caused by the shock breakout in the wind with @xmath5 , it indicates that non - steady mass loss producing the flat dense wind @xmath110 may take place just before the explosions of some massive stars .",
    "in addition , our model for type iin lsn 2006gy prefers @xmath111 because @xmath45 of the @xmath72 model may be too small to account for the lc of sn 2006gy after the peak .",
    "this also supports the existence of the non - steady mass loss at the pre - sn stage of the massive stars .",
    "@xcite show that the density slope of the wind estimated from x - ray observations of type iin sne is inconsistent with @xmath112 .",
    "they show that type iin sne do not usually come from the steady wind with @xmath112 .",
    "x - ray luminous type iin sne are presumed to be originated from relatively dense winds with high mass - loss rates . although the wind densities of these sne are not high enough to be lsne , it is highly possible that the dense winds from higher mass - loss rates also result in flat or steep density slopes .",
    "the presence of the two kinds of slopes can end up with two different kinds of type ii lsne .",
    "so far , we just consider a single slope for the dense wind .",
    "one essential difference between type iin and type iil lsne is the existence of the spatially - large optically - thin region in the wind of type iin lsne which can make narrow p - cygni profiles .",
    "although we show that large @xmath3 can make such spatially - large optically - thin region with the optically thick region inside , the similar condition can also be achieved by assuming the two components in the wind , i.e. , optically thick ( inside ) and thin ( outside ) regions with any density slopes .",
    "the two - component wind configuration is suggested for , e.g. , type iin sn 1998s @xcite .",
    "both models can explain type iin lsne .",
    "in either case , the p - cygni profiles can be observed not only after but also before the lc peak . currently , there are no spectral observations of type iin lsne before the lc peak with resolutions sufficient to resolve the narrow p - cygni profile and the high resolution spectroscopic observations before the lc peak are important to reveal the wind surrounding lsne .",
    "our model can not be simply extended to the spectral evolution of other kinds of lsne without h lines .",
    "especially , type ic lsne with fast lc decline show , e.g. , si and o lines which are not seen in types ii lsne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although it is possible that the shock breakout in a dense wind also occurs in type ic lsne as is suggested by @xcite , it seems to be difficult to attribute the difference between type ic lsne and type ii lsne only to the density slope of the dense wind .",
    "for example , the composition of the wind is presumed to be quite different between type ic and type ii lsne . if the shock breakout in the dense wind is also taking place in type ic lsne , narrow spectral lines from the materials other than h may be observed .",
    "while we focus on the origin of type iil lsne in this paper , the understanding of other type iil sne , i.e. , less - luminous type iil sne , is also lacking .",
    "currently , there are many models for type iin sne but only a few models exist for type iil sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although the diversity in the wind condition may be related to other type iil sne , there can be other important , but currently ignored , ingredients for the full understanding of type iil sne .",
    "we investigate the effect of the non - steady mass loss on the shock breakout in the dense wind .",
    "the non - steady mass loss varies the density slope of the wind @xmath113 and the density slope alters the ratio of the diffusion timescale in the optically thick wind ( @xmath48 ) and the shock propagation timescale of the entire wind ( @xmath50 ) after the shock breakout in the wind .",
    "both timescales are comparable @xmath114 for @xmath4 and @xmath6 becomes smaller as @xmath3 gets larger .",
    "this is because the last scattering surface of the dense wind locates farther inside from the wind surface for the wind with the steeper density gradient ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the difference can only be obtained by the careful treatment of the shock breakout condition in the dense wind ( section [ sec2 ] ; equation ( [ breakout ] ) ) .",
    "if the two timescales are comparable @xmath114 , the forward shock goes through the entire wind just after the lc reaches the peak with the timescale @xmath48 . in this case , no signature on the spectra from the wind is expected to be observed especially after the lc peak because the entire wind is already shocked after the lc peak . on the other hand ,",
    "if the two timescales are different ( @xmath58 ) , the shock continues to propagate in the wind after the lc peak and the unshocked wind remains after the lc peak .",
    "thus , narrow p - cygni profiles from the wind are expected to be observed even after the lc peak .",
    "the former case corresponds to type iil lsne and the latter to type iin lsne .",
    "the difference in the density slope can also account for the lack of the lorentzian emission profiles in type iil lsne .",
    "our results imply that the luminosity of type iil lsne can be explained in the context of the shock interaction between sn ejecta and the dense wind even if they do not show the signature of the wind in their spectra .",
    "we propose that the difference between type iin and type iil lsne can stem from the density slope of the dense wind which results from the non - steady mass loss of their progenitors .",
