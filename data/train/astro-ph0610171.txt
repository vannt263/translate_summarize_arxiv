    "the connection between the morphology of a galaxy and the density of its environment ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , measured in a variety of ways , is an important clue to the physics of galaxy formation , and forms a readily observable quantity that can be compared with simulations .",
    "numerous physical processes affect the evolution of a galaxy as a function of its density environment .",
    "the debate is ongoing as to which of these are intrinsic to the galaxies at formation and which are the result of later evolution .",
    "the relative importance of different processes depends on the density of the environment .",
    "for example , in clusters infalling galaxies are subject to ram - pressure stripping and galaxy harassment . in groups , mergers , interactions and strangulation",
    "are more important .",
    "it is thought that ellipticals formed their stars early , exhausting their gas supply and are now passively evolving in dense environments , whereas spirals formed their stars more slowly , continuing to the present day and becoming subject to the physical processes described on infall into denser environments as the structure evolved .",
    "we do not attempt to provide a full reference list for physical processes here , but recent reviews of the subject include @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , the morphology of the galaxies is affected in ways not necessarily correlated with the effect on spectral properties or colour .",
    "one can therefore investigate the morphology - density and colour - density relations and subtract the two to see if a residual relation remains .",
    "if so , then there is an intrinsic effect of density that is not a result of a more fundamental process which causes the other relation .",
    "a particular example of this is the hypothesis that the properties of galaxies within a dark matter halo depend only on the mass of the halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this can be tested both for colour and for morphology , although here we do not specifically relate our results to haloes .",
    "many results support this assumption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the question is not yet necessarily settled as @xcite find that the morphology and luminosity are more fundamental . similarly , @xcite study the abell 901/902 supercluster and find that the local environment is more important than the global for morphology , but @xcite study numerous superclusters in the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite and find that both the cluster and supercluster environment influence morphology .",

    "they found a pronounced bimodal distribution well - fit by a sum of two gaussians . at fixed luminosity ,",
    "the mean colours of the two distributions were approximately independent of environment , but the red fraction strongly increased with density .",
    "the density measure used was the projected distance to the fifth nearest neighbour in a redshift slice of width @xmath2 .",
    "the part of our work dealing with @xmath0 significantly parallels this work , although for a sample size containing three times as many galaxies .",

    "@xcite use an adaptive kernel estimate of density and the morphological separation via colour gradient of @xcite and find little residual dependence of properties on environment at fixed luminosity and morphology , except for a sharp decrease in late types at the bright end .",
    "some of these results are described further in  [ subsec : comparison ] below .    here",
    ", we use the fourth data release ( dr4 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to investigate the colour - density and morphology - density relations in a large volume - limited sample .",
    "we divide the sample by density and luminosity and investigate the trends of colour and morphology as a function of each , fitting gaussians to the bimodal distributions in colour and morphology .    the sample size , quality of photometry and corresponding spectra enable robust conclusions to be drawn from the data .",
    "however , the available resolution limits us to simple measures of colour and morphology . accordingly , as done by previous authors , we use the @xmath0 colour , inverse concentration index , @xmath3 and the srsic index , @xmath4 , each single - number axisymmetric measures of galaxy properties .",
    "however , in addition to this , we supplement the morphological measures with the hubble type assigned by an artificial neural network ( ann , * ? ? ?",
    "this assigns t types 06 , corresponding to e , s0 , sa , sb , sc , sd and i m , to a limiting magnitude of @xmath5 ( compared to @xmath6 for @xmath0 , @xmath3 and srsic @xmath4 ) .",
    "the hubble type utilises more information from an image , for example spiral arm structure , and as such may show patterns unseen in the @xmath3 and srsic @xmath4 .",
    "given the wide usage over time of this measure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it is important that its usefulness is investigated in this context : if the results using the simple hubble type used here are not useful even with the quality and quantity of the data we utilise , this will emphasize the requirement for different and more detailed measures of morphology for progress to be made .",

    "the targeting pipeline @xcite chooses targets for spectroscopy from the imaging .",
    "a tiling algorithm @xcite then assigns the spectroscopic fibres to the targets , the main source of incompleteness being the minimum distance of 55 arcsec between the fibres .",
    "this causes about 6% of galaxies to be missed ; those that are will be biased towards regions with a high surface density of galaxies .",
    "the algorithm gives a more uniform completeness on the sky than a uniform tiling by taking into account large scale structure , but the effect is still present .",
    "the other main source of incompleteness is galaxies blended with saturated stars , which is a 1% level effect .",
    "the overall spectroscopic completeness is therefore estimated to be over 90% @xcite .    the sdss galaxies with spectra consist of a flux - limited sample , main , with a median redshift of 0.104 @xcite ; a luminous red galaxy sample ( lrg ) , approximately volume - limited to @xmath19 @xcite ; and a quasar sample @xcite .",
    "the limiting magnitude for the main spectra is @xmath6 , which is substantially brighter than that for the imaging so the redshift completeness is almost 100% .",
    "a typical signal - to - noise value is @xmath20 per pixel and the spectral resolution is 1800 .",
    "the redshifts have an rms accuracy of @xmath21 .",
    "we use galaxies from the main galaxy sample .",
    "the data are extracted from the new york value - added galaxy catalogue ( vagc , * ? ? ?",
    "they are masked , extinction- and k - corrected in the same way as the datasets in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b06 ) .",
    "there is no correction for evolution , but as the redshifts are limited to @xmath1 its effects are not large .",
    "similarly , there is no correction for dust , but this is mitigated by the requirement that the galaxy axis ratio be less than that of an e7 galaxy , as described in b06 .",
    "the masking of the dataset as in b06 leaves a sample of 489,123 galaxies .",
    "these are matched to the galaxies in the pittsburgh - cmu value added catalogue ( vac , http://nvogre.phyast.pitt.edu/dr4_value_added ) .",
    "the matches were carried out using the unique identification , both in object and date of observation , provided by the spectroscopic plate , mjd and fibre values for each object .",
    "the matches were made in order to utilise their measures of the distance from each galaxy to the nearest survey edge , which use a sophisticated algorithm taking into account the full survey mask .",
    "galaxies measured by the vac as being nearer to a survey edge than their nth nearest neighbour are excluded to prevent the densities being biased downward near the survey edge or at the higher redshifts in the sample .",
    "we do , however , calculate our own environmental densities , as the vac density sample is restricted to the range @xmath22 to gain an improved measure of the star formation rate , which is not considered here .",
    "we follow the method of b04 : the density is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the distance to the @xmath25th nearest neighbour within @xmath26 in redshift .",
    "this is used to minimize contamination from interlopers . here",
    "the value of @xmath25 used is 5 , following b04 who choose this value to approximate @xcite who uses @xmath27 before correction for superimposed galaxies .",
    "we bin the sample in steps of 0.5 over the range @xmath28 , a factor of 1,000 in density .",
    "we set a limiting absolute magnitude for galaxies to be counted as neighbours of @xmath29 , corresponding to one magnitude fainter than the value of @xmath30 found for the overall schechter fit to the galaxy luminosity function of b06 .",
    "the corresponding limiting redshift , at which a galaxy of this magnitude has an apparent magnitude @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "this gives a sample volume - limited to a distance comparable to the @xmath33 of b04 .",
    "we also require @xmath34 to exclude very local objects .",
    "we measure densities for galaxies in the range @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 , binning in steps of one magnitude .",
    "this again is similar to the range of @xmath37 of b04 .",
    "we use @xmath0 colour following b04 and @xcite , who find that the galaxy population is well described as the sum of two gaussians in @xmath0 , with an optimal colour separator of 2.22 @xcite .",
    "we use the model colours from the same dataset as b06 , extinction- and k - corrected , as in that paper , to a rest - frame band - shift of @xmath38 , denoted throughout in the plots by @xmath39 , and in the text by @xmath0 .",
    "the model colours are derived from the sdss model magnitudes .",
    "for each galaxy these are derived from the best fitting of a de vaucouleurs @xcite or exponential profile @xcite .    for morphology , we use three measures : the inverse concentration index , @xmath3 , the srsic index , @xmath4 and the hubble type .",
    "the @xmath3 and srsic index provide a measure of morphology that , while simple , is available for the full @xmath40 sample .",
    "@xmath3 is directly from the sdss dr4 and is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the @xmath43 light petrosian radius ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the inverse is used because it has the range 01 .",
    "the srsic index , from the vagc , is the exponent in the formula for a generalised galaxy light profile given by @xcite , or more recently in e.g. @xcite .",
    "because @xmath4 is an exponent , and the bimodality shows more clearly when it is done so , @xmath4 is binned logarithmically , as with the density . as with the colours ,",
    "these are binned appropriately , giving bins of @xmath44 in steps of 0.07 and @xmath45 in steps of 0.2 .",
    "we truncate the srsic index at @xmath46 to avoid a spike in the number of galaxies in the vagc data with @xmath47 .",
    "their data is also truncated at @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "parameters other than colours are measured in the @xmath14 band , since this band is used to define the aperture through which petrosian flux is measured for all five bands .",
    "the ann morphologies used were also the same as those in b06 , assigned as in @xcite and updated as described in b06 .",
    "the types assigned correspond to the hubble types e=0 , s0=1 , sa=2 , sb=3 , sc=4 , sd=5 and im=6 .",
    "as described in b06 , there is bias away from the ends of the scale , particularly for late types .",
    "this is probably due to the dominant contribution of the concentration index in the training set , which shows a similar bias , and the relative lack of types of sd or later in the training set , about 5% of the total @xcite in part due to the @xmath14 band selection of the sdss instead of the more commonly used bluer bands .",
    "hence the latest types assigned have @xmath50 . fig .",
    "[ fig : galaxies ] shows a random sample of five galaxies from each t type , rounded to the integers 04 .",
    "we bin the ann morphologies in five bins from @xmath51@xmath52 .",
    "the colours are also binned in five bins . unlike the other measures presented , the limiting magnitude for the ann morphologies is @xmath5 , as this was the faintest level to which the visually assigned training set was generated . of",
    "the galaxies studied here , 13,655 have a value for @xmath53 and a valid density .",
    "combined with the absolute magnitude limit of @xmath54 , these limits ensure that there is no extrapolation from the ann training set in apparent or absolute magnitude .    for each set of measurements ,",
    "the galaxies are required to have values within the ranges of the bins of all quantities that are binned , i.e. density , luminosity , and one or both of colour and morphology .",
    "this ensures that each related figure is showing the same galaxies .",
    "the resulting samples consist of 79,553 galaxies for @xmath0 , 79,606 for @xmath3 , 75,861 for srsic index and 13,655 for @xmath53 .",
    "for the residuals in @xmath0 and morphology , requiring both colour and morphology to be within the bin ranges reduces the sample sizes to 79,495 , 75,753 and 13,638 respectively .",
    "the data points for the histograms of colour and morphology for bins of @xmath55 and @xmath56 are fitted with a double gaussian using a simplex search algorithm over the ranges @xmath57 , @xmath44 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the number of galaxies outside these ranges is small , being less than 1% of the total .",
    "the fits involve six parameters and are given by @xmath60 where the @xmath61 are gaussians with mean @xmath62 and standard deviation @xmath63 and @xmath64 and @xmath65 are scalars . whereas b04 constrain the @xmath63 values of the gaussians to be functions of @xmath56 only , here",
    "we do not apply any restrictions on the parameters of the two gaussians in one plot relative to any others .",

    "it is clear that there is a broad division into two populations .",
    "this division justifies the treatment below of the galaxies as two populations modelled by a double gaussian , which is used in  [ subsec : gaussian][subsec : residual ] below to quantify the trends seen in more detail .    in fig .",

    "what does change radically is the relative numbers of galaxies in each population , which is emphasized here by the normalisation applied to the contours in each panel .",
    "blue colours and diffuse morphologies dominate in galaxies of low luminosity in low density environments .",

    "[ fig : t contour ] shows that there are again similar patterns in @xmath53 morphology .",

    "as expected , the fraction of blue galaxies decreases with density .",
    "the position of the blue peak moves redwards from @xmath79 to @xmath80 and that of the red peak stays approximately constant , with just a slight reddening from @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",
    "unlike the peaks , the position of the minimum between the two distributions stays constant , although in the higher density and luminosity bins the exact position of the minimum is unclear .",
    "versus luminosity , a similar trend is seen with the red peak moving slightly bluewards and dropping in fraction with decreasing luminosity and the blue peak becoming bluer .",
    "bright galaxies at @xmath83 are relatively rare as are faint galaxies due to the @xmath6 limit for spectra .",
    "the figure represents an update of fig . 1 of b04 , using dr4 rather than dr1 and with the differences described in  [ sec : data ] above .",
    "as mentioned , b04 find that at fixed luminosity the mean colours of the two distributions are nearly independent of density , with just a weak trend for colours to become redder at high densities , but that the fraction of red galaxies rises sharply at all luminosities .",

    "the lack of ( or less clear ) division into a bimodal population suggests that if galaxies really are divided into just two dominant populations then either ( 1 ) the @xmath53 is insensitive to it , spreading between the two ; ( 2 ) that @xmath53 is more sensitive to transitional states between the two , such as s0 galaxies , than colour , or ( 3 ) the @xmath53 is an intrinsically ` fuzzy ' measure , resulting in a inevitable spread across types .",

    "@xcite present the morphology - density relation for the sdss edr .",
    "they assign morphology using the inverse concentration index , as used here , and a preliminary version of the texture parameter described by @xcite .",
    "the latter is corrected for elliptical isophotes and gives an improved correlation to visual morphology .",
    "the galaxies are divided into early , intermediate , early disc and late disc .",
    "the sample is volume - limited to @xmath104 in the redshift range @xmath105 and contains 7,938 galaxies .",
    "this compares to our values of @xmath29 , @xmath106 and 13,655 galaxies .",
    "the same @xmath107 , @xmath108 euclidean cosmology is used . their density estimator is three dimensional .",
    "they find the expected trend of increasing early - type fraction with increasing density , and also two characteristic scales , giving three density regimes . in the lowest density regime ,",
    "the relation is less noticeable . in the intermediate density regime",
    ", intermediate type galaxies increase with density and spirals decrease . in the densest regime , the intermediate types decrease and the early types increase .",
    "thus the morphology is little affected in the low density regime , then subject to a mechanism which inhibits star formation and turns spirals into intermediate types in the intermediate density regime , then a third process decreases these types and increases early types in the dense regime .",
    "our work is consistent with this , with the bridge between the two bimodal populations resembling the intermediate types described here .",
    "it is difficult to compare quantitatively , however , as the density measures are different .",
    "@xcite study numerous galaxy properties as a function of environment in various volume - limited samples containing up to 80,479 galaxies for @xmath109 using a subset of the sdss dr5 .",
    "the galaxy properties studied include the @xmath39 colour and morphology assigned using the colour gradient method of @xcite .",
    "their measure of density is obtained using an adaptive smoothing kernel , so again an exact quantitative comparison with our results would be difficult .",
    "their fig .",
    "9 shows the fraction of early - type galaxies ( as defined in @xcite ) as a function of density and luminosity .",
    "the result shows the same trends as our fig .",
    "5 , with a monotonic increase in early - type fraction with density and luminosity , and the trend lines separated by luminosity approximately parallel to each other . however",
    ", they also fix both luminosity and morphology and then find little residual dependence of properties on environment , except for a sharp decrease in late types at the bright end .",
    "considering the number of galaxies , the variety of their properties and environments and the quality of the sdss data , the rest - frame colour histograms are well fit by a simple sum of two gaussians .",
    "this result is also seen by b04 and others and strongly suggests two underlying populations of galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the patterns seen in the lfs in b06 ( their figs .",
    "2 , 3 , 4 and 6 show the lf bivariate with @xmath53 , @xmath3 , srsic @xmath4 and @xmath39 respectively ) . there , an early morphological type , concentrated , early spectral type , red , high srsic index population of galaxies is evident and the lfs binned in absolute magnitude and plotted against their second parameter often show bimodality .",
    "one of the main questions asked in this paper is whether the morphology reveals anything that the colours do not .",
    "compared to @xmath0 , the @xmath3 and srsic @xmath4 also show clearly bimodal distributions , although the @xmath3 plot becomes unimodal at fainter magnitudes and low densities .",
    "there are no obvious residual relations when those due to colour are removed , thus these measures of morphology appear not to be predictive of environment beyond their correlation to colour .",
    "when the @xmath53 morphology - density relation is plotted the distributions are less bimodal , ranging from looking similar to the plots for colour to being not bimodal at all .",
    "there are various possible reasons for this , including ( 1 ) the morphology may be less sensitive to the processes producing the bimodal population in colour , being intrinsically spread when compared to the colour - producing physics ; ( 2 ) there may be more than two populations , the third or higher to which colour may not be sensitive ( an example might be s0 galaxies , which are almost as red as ellipticals ) ; or ( 3 ) the neural network morphological types might be spread or biased versus the true types . the last point is not thought to be likely @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to distinguish between the intrinsic spread or more populations possibilities , although the fact that some of the bins are more bimodal than others favours the third population idea . here",
    "neither possibility is ruled out and indeed both could be occurring .",
    "more detailed investigation of the morphology - colour - density relationship may be useful , but it may remain the case that the morphologies are simply intrinsically too ` fuzzy ' to show the underlying populations as clearly as the colour .",
    "that said , @xmath53 has larger error bars , so the formal goodness of fit is not necessarily worse than that for @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this spreading of hubble types between the two populations is also seen by various other workers . in the millennium galaxy catalogue ( mgc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite study a sample of 3314 galaxies with eyeball hubble types at @xmath110 and find that , while types e / s0 ( bulges ) exclusively occupy the early - type peak and sd and later ( discs ) the late - type peak , the sa ",
    "sc , which are a mixture of bulge and disc , are spread between the two peaks .",
    "also in the mgc , @xcite study a well - defined sample of 350 galaxies and find , using multivariate statistical analysis of the galaxy properties , that only two populations , corresponding to early and late types , are justified , and the late types ( sa  irr ) are smoothly spread within the late - type region of parameter space . in a sample of 1,246 galaxies with hubble types from the revised shapely - ames catalogue ,",
    "@xcite similarly find a continuum of hubble types but a bimodality in colour .    in a sample of 22,121 galaxies from the third reference catalogue of bright galaxies",
    ", @xcite finds that the best three parameters with which to classify galaxies are mass , star formation and merger history .",
    "the hubble type correlates most strongly with stellar mass , @xmath111 and @xmath112 colour .",
    "they also ( his fig .",
    "10 ) confirm the intrinsic spread in morphology when compared to other properties such as colour , showing that morphology is at least to some extent independent of the other parameters .",
    "@xcite discuss the work in @xcite and b04 and agree with the interpretation of morphology , in the sense that ` whatever processes give rise to the blue / red distribution should also give rise to _ distributions _ in morphology ' , although they go on to say that ` thus , s0 or sa galaxies could have a probability of belonging to one or the other distributions and should not be considered as classes ' .",
    "the physics giving the bimodal population in colour is thought to be that red galaxies have a passively evolving old stellar population and are formed by major mergers .",
    "the blue galaxies are undergoing star formation and less violent accretion events .",
    "galaxies can change from blue to red and when they do they do so rapidly , leaving few galaxies in between the two populations . b04",
    "go on to propose that ` most star forming galaxies today evolve at a rate that is determined primarily by their intrinsic properties , and independent of environment ' , which is consistent with the results here .",
    "the morphology may be seeing extra physics at work , for example ram - pressure stripping of gas from a galaxy infalling into a cluster can turn a spiral into an s0 rather than an elliptical , even though they are almost as red .",
    "s0s are sufficiently common that they should show up as a component in the plots in this paper if they indeed form a component distinct from other galaxies . in comparison to simulations , only recently have semi - analytic models begun to produce bimodal populations matching those observed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so there may still be much to be gained by a detailed intercomparison between the two .",
    "the ann types are biased away from very early or late types , but not to an extent large enough to affect the overall trends seen here .",
    "this is thought to be due to the importance of the concentration index in the training set , which has a similar bias .",
    "a larger training set for morphology is needed , particularly for very late types of type scd or later , corresponding to @xmath113 .",
    "our training set was based on the sdss edr version of the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "however , their published version , while based on dr3 and 40% larger at 2658 galaxies instead of 1875 , would be unlikely to significantly improve our results due to the intrinsic spread in @xmath53 and the @xmath14-band object selection of the sdss , which limits the scd or later types to 5.2% of the sample .",
    "they compare this to 10.6% from the earlier b - band study of @xcite .    here",
    "the model @xmath0 colour was used .",
    "@xcite showed that the core @xmath0 , measured using the psf colour , provides a cleaner separation for their sample when used in conjunction with the srsic index .",
    "the same may be true here if that @xmath0 were used , although the model @xmath0 is cleaner than the petrosian @xmath0 , for which we also generated results .",
    "@xcite also argue that the two fundamental components are , rather than red and blue galaxies , bulges and discs .",
    "this is consistent with the results here .",
    "however , it is not necessarily that simple , as @xcite differentiate classical and pseudobulges , which have different formation mechanisms , and find that , for types sa - sbc for a given bulge - to - total light ratio , the former are predominantly in red galaxies and the latter in blue , i.e. , the bimodal distribution is not simply due to the bulge to disk ratio .",
    "galaxy properties are studied as a function of environment in the sdss , specifically the relations between @xmath0 restframe colour , morphological type and the environmental density .",
    "the colour is given by the restframe value of @xmath0 .",
    "the morphology is in the form of the inverse concentration index , @xmath3 , the srsic index , @xmath4 and the hubble t type , @xmath53 , the latter assigned by a trained artificial neural network .",
    "the density is the @xmath94 surface density of galaxies measured by the fifth nearest neighbour brighter than an @xmath14 band absolute magnitude of @xmath114 .",
    "the range of density probed covers all environments from the cores of rich clusters to the field .",
    "the colour results are similar to those of @xcite ( b04 ) but here these are extended to galaxy morphology .",
    "subdivision of the population by density and luminosity shows a clear bimodal distribution in the colour - morphology plane . for each subsample",
    "we fit the colour and morphology by a sum of two gaussians . the well - known colour - density and morphology - density relations",
    "the colour is well fit by the gaussian sum , confirming two underlying populations , one red and one blue , as seen by b04 .",
    "the mean colour of the red population is approximately constant but the blue population gets slightly redder with increasing density .",
    "the relations are seen at high significance over the range of densities probed , thus confirming that they extend into the field and are not just present in galaxy clusters .",
    "compared to @xmath0 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the @xmath53 morphology is less obviously fit by the sum of two gaussians , suggesting one or more of the possibilities ( 1 ) three or more populations ( e.g. early , lenticular and late ) , ( 2 ) sensitivity of the morphology to processes which do not affect the colours , or ( 3 ) a higher intrinsic spread in morphology compared to two underlying populations and physical processes .",
    "while the @xmath3 and srsic @xmath4 to some extent separate the two main galaxy populations , certainly more cleanly than the hubble type , both still suffer from extensive overlap in the populations . figs .",
    "[ fig : ci contour][fig : t contour ] show that , rather than using a single colour or morphology , improved separations should be obtained using a division in the plane of colour and morphology rather than any single measure . in its simplest form in figs . [",
    "fig : ci contour][fig : t contour ] , this would correspond to the allowance of an oblique line as a separator instead of an axis - parallel line ( c.f .",
    "6 of @xcite , fig .",
    "10 of @xcite , or fig .",
    "15 of @xcite , which also show this planar distribution ) .",
    "the colour - density relation divided into bins by absolute magnitude reproduces the results of b04 : the mean colours are independent of density for fixed luminosity but the red fraction increases with increasing density .",
    "the fraction of red galaxies increases approximately linearly with density , with parallel slopes of lower fraction for decreasing luminosity .",
    "the dispersion in colour for each population is low for red galaxies , increasing with decreasing luminosity and decreasing with density for low luminosity . for blue galaxies",
    "it is significantly higher increasing at low luminosity with density . at high luminosity",
    "there is now a significant trend with density .",
    "the morphology - density relations divided in this way are similar if the early - type galaxies are red .",
    "the early - type galaxy fractions increase in a similar way to the fraction of red galaxies but the trends are noisier .",
    "the mean types versus density are similar to colour but the late types do not as obviously get earlier with density , consistent with the colour having a stronger dependence on density than morphology . the dispersions show few significant trends with density .    in @xmath0",
    "there is a clear residual relation of galaxies for both blue and red galaxies with density even after the reddening due to the increase in early types is removed .",
    "this suggests that colour has a stronger dependence on density than morphology , in agreement with other studies .    for each of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath53 ,",
    "there is no evidence of a residual trend once that due to variation with colour is removed .",
