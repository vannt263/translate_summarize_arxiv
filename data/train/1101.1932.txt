    "similar considerations could be used for tiling the undirected forms of the graphs .",
    "we begin by defining some notation .",
    "first we define a ( directed ) de bruijn graph .",
    "the de bruijn graph @xmath7 of degree @xmath4 and diameter @xmath5 is a digraph with @xmath8 vertices .",

    "this leads naturally to an inductive construction of @xmath13 as a family of iterated line digraphs .",
    "a ( directed ) kautz graph @xmath14 of degree @xmath4 and diameter @xmath15 can be defined similarly as a digraph with @xmath16 vertices labeled by strings @xmath17 where the integers @xmath18 are taken base @xmath19 , but subject to the condition that adjacent integers must be distinct .",
    "the edges of @xmath14 are given in a similar fashion to ( [ eq : dbe ] ) by @xmath20    some simple examples of de bruijn and kautz graphs for small values of the degree @xmath4 and diameter are depicted in figures  [ f : dk22]-[f : dk32 ]    ( 200,100)(- 100,- 50 ) ( 10,10)(0,0 ) ( -70,-50)(0,0)(a ) ( 70,-50)(0,0)(b )    ( 200,100)(- 100,- 45 ) ( 5,15)(0,0 ) ( -77,-50)(0,0)(a ) ( 77,-50)(0,0)(b )    kautz graphs and de bruijn graphs both have uniform in - degree and out - degree @xmath4 .",

    "this basic method , described in @xcite , is used in @xcite to construct a lower bound on the edge bisection width of de bruijn and kautz graphs .",
    "consider a tiling of the de bruijn graph @xmath7 by tiles of size @xmath56 .",
    "for a given tile @xmath42 , consider the @xmath73 paths of length @xmath5 which go from a node in @xmath42 to a node in the de bruijn graph outside tile @xmath42 .",
    "each of these must cross at least one edge which begins at a node in @xmath42 and ends at a node outside @xmath42 .",
    "we refer to such at edge as an edge `` leaving '' the tile @xmath42 .",
    "each edge leaving the tile is traversed by at most @xmath74 of the paths under consideration ( since the edge fixes @xmath15 of the @xmath75 @xmath76 s defining the path , but may appear at any of @xmath5 places in the path ) .",
    "thus , the number of edges leaving the tile ( @xmath77 ) is at least @xmath78 for any choice of paths , and for any tile @xmath42 .",

    "* corollary * for fixed @xmath4 and large @xmath57 the lower bound on the number of edges leaving the tile goes asymptotically as @xmath80    * proof * :    by taking @xmath81 , we have @xmath82 in section [ sec : efficient ] we explicitly construct a class of tilings which realize this asymptotic bound to within a factor of 2 .",
    "the asymptotic lower bound we have found here for the number of broken edges is similar in form to that found in @xcite for bisection of de bruijn and kautz graphs .",
    "those authors found that the edge bisection width @xmath83 satisfies the asymptotic inequalities @xmath84 note that the asymptotic form of the lower bounds agrees for @xmath85 , where the tiling and bisection problems are equivalent .",
    "in this section we prove a necessary condition which a tile of size @xmath56 must satisfy to lead to a scalable tiling .",
    "we then prove a related but slightly stronger sufficient condition for scalable tilings , by giving a general construction of a class of tilings based on any tile which satisfies the sufficient condition .",
    "we begin with a few definitions    * definition * : a _ stratification _ of a directed graph @xmath38 is a map @xmath86 from the vertices of @xmath38 into the integers such that for every edge @xmath33 in @xmath38 , we have @xmath87    we refer to @xmath88 as the _ level _ of the vertex @xmath35 in the stratified graph @xmath38 . by convention , we take the smallest level in a stratification to be 0 by shifting all levels equally .",
    "we refer to a graph which admits a stratification as _ stratifiable_.    * definition * : a _ loop _ is a directed graph which is topologically equivalent to a circle .",
    "note that the edges in a loop need not have compatible orientations .",
    "it is straightforward to show that a loop is stratifiable if and only if it contains an equal number of edges of each orientation .",
    "for example , the loop defined by the graph containing 3 vertices @xmath89 and edges @xmath90 is unstratifiable since a stratification would give @xmath91 from the first two edges and @xmath92 from the third edge .    * lemma 1 * : a graph @xmath38 is stratifiable if and only if it contains no unstratifiable loops as subgraphs .    * proof * : if @xmath38 contains an unstratifiable loop @xmath93 then @xmath38 is clearly not itself stratifiable since any stratification of @xmath38 would provide a stratification of @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath38 contains no unstratifiable loops , then we can explicitly construct a stratification of @xmath38 by choosing a single reference vertex in each connected component of @xmath38 and assigning the level of each other vertex @xmath94 in @xmath38 by implementing the rule ( [ eq : stratification - rule ] ) on each of the edges needed to reach @xmath94 on any path from a reference vertex , allowing the path to traverse edges in either direction . in the absence of unstratifiable loops , this assignment is path independent and",
    "provides a stratification of @xmath38 .",
    "we can now prove the following    * theorem 2 * : a necessary condition for a tile @xmath42 of size @xmath95 to give scalable tilings of @xmath7 and @xmath14 for all @xmath96 is that @xmath42 must be stratifiable .    * proof * : we begin by assuming that @xmath42 is unstratifiable and therefore contains an unstratifiable loop .",
    "we will show that this assumption leads to the conclusion that @xmath42 can not be used to construct scalable tilings , thus proving the theorem by contradiction .    assuming that a given tile @xmath42 contains an unstratifiable loop @xmath93 of length @xmath97 , we write @xmath93 in terms of the sequence of vertices in @xmath42 it traverses .",

    ". in particular , there will be @xmath103 nodes @xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "choose any such node @xmath108 which can be written as @xmath109 for some fixed @xmath110 .",
    "then we can define a loop in @xmath7 through @xmath111 whose vertices must satisfy @xmath112 since @xmath113 , when we follow the loop around , the string of characters defining @xmath114 has been shifted to the left @xmath115 times .",
    "but we have returned to @xmath114 after going around the full loop ; this implies that the bulk of the word @xmath116 is invariant under shifting left by @xmath117 .",
    "specifically , @xmath118 but only @xmath119 nodes have this property ( such nodes are completely defined by giving @xmath120 ) , so we can not have @xmath103 nodes with @xmath121 when @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the assumption of an unstratifiable loop is incompatible with the assumption of a scalable tiling for @xmath42 , so we conclude that if @xmath42 can be used to construct a scalable tiling it can not contain an unstratifiable loop , and therefore must be stratifiable .",
    "the theorem is thus proven .",
    "the condition of stratifiability is not by itself sufficient to guarantee that a tile gives rise to a scalable tiling . in some cases ,",
    "stratifiable loops can form obstructions to the construction of a tiling .",
    "we now will proceed to prove that scalable tilings can be constructed on stratifiable tiles with certain types of loops .",
    "first , however , we need a few more definitions and a lemma .",
    "* lemma 2 * : a tile of size @xmath123 giving scalable tilings of @xmath46 and @xmath14 for @xmath96 must be a stratifiable subgraph of @xmath124    * proof * : the tile must be stratifiable by theorem 2 .",
    "it must be a subgraph of @xmath125 since it must tile @xmath46 with @xmath126 . note that since @xmath123 , the subgraph contains all vertices of @xmath124 , but",
    "will only contain a subset of the edges .",
    "we can thus associate with any scalable tiling of a de bruijn or kautz graph @xmath127 or @xmath14 a map @xmath128 . for the tilings which we will construct",

    "property when @xmath131    note in particular that if @xmath129 has both the parent and child distribution properties , then for any vertex @xmath132 with @xmath133 , there is a unique parent @xmath134 of @xmath35 with @xmath135 and a unique child @xmath136 of @xmath35 with @xmath137 for each @xmath138 .",
    "we now prove by example that there exist maps @xmath129 with @xmath127 or @xmath14 which have both the parent and child distribution properties , for any @xmath96    for a de bruijn graph @xmath7 , we begin by defining the @xmath139th _ discrete differentials_. for each vertex @xmath140 we define @xmath141 let us fix @xmath142 and take @xmath143 .",

    "the parallel routing property can also be seen to follow immediately from the fact that @xmath66 is a graph homomorphism .",
    "we have now provided results which make it possible to systematically search for optimal solutions to problem 3 . we know",
    "that for tile size @xmath123 , scalable tilings are given by stratifiable subgraphs of @xmath210 .",

    "we conclude this section with some further comments .",
    "first , we note that the discrete differential construction above is not the only way to realize a map @xmath129 with the parent and child distribution properties .",
    "indeed , consider any function @xmath212 with the following properties :    * for each @xmath213 @xmath214 gives a one - to - one map from @xmath215 ( _ i.e. _ , for fixed @xmath150 , @xmath216 takes different values for each @xmath217 ) * for each @xmath218 @xmath219 gives a one - to - one map from @xmath215 ( _ i.e. _ , for fixed @xmath217 , @xmath216 takes different values for each @xmath150 )    if we replace @xmath220 in ( [ eq : dcc ] ) with any other function @xmath221 with these properties , we see that the associated map @xmath222 still has the child and parent distribution properties when @xmath38 is either a de bruijn or kautz graph .",
    "using such a more general map in the construction of theorem 3 provides a more general class of constructions of scalable tilings with the parallel routing property .",
    "note however that not every graph homomorphism of the form @xmath223 has the parent and child distribution properties .",
    "for example , while the map @xmath224 defined by taking a contiguous subset @xmath225 of characters in the string @xmath226 is a homomorphism , it does not have these properties , and indeed can not be used to define a tiling . to see this clearly in a specific simple case ,",
    "consider the case @xmath227 .",
    "we can not tile the 27-node de bruijn graph @xmath228 using tiles with vertices addressed by @xmath229 .",
    "for example , the 3 parents of the vertex @xmath230 have coordinates @xmath231 .",
    "these vertices all have the same value of @xmath232 , so the graph homomorphism taking @xmath233 does not have the parent distribution property .",
    "assume now for example that our tile includes the edge @xmath234 .",
    "the vertex @xmath235 , which should be associated with the vertex @xmath236 on the tile has no parent with @xmath237 , so the edge @xmath234 can not be contained in the tile .",
    "similar problems arise with any other edge , so we can not tile @xmath228 with tiles having vertices addressed by @xmath238 and more than 0 edges .",
    "in this section we describe tilings of generalized de bruijn and kautz graphs .",
    "so far , we have discussed only de bruijn and kautz graphs of sizes @xmath8 and @xmath239 respectively .",
    "generalizations of the de bruijn and kautz graphs to other sizes are described in @xcite .",
    "we show here that the construction of the previous section gives tilings by tiles of size @xmath240 for generalized de bruijn and kautz graphs with @xmath241 vertices for any integer @xmath97 .      a generalized de bruijn graph of degree @xmath4 having @xmath242 vertices can be defined by taking the directed graph on vertices @xmath243 with edges @xmath244 if @xmath245 , it is easy to see that this definition agrees with the one in ( [ eq : dbe ] ) by simply taking @xmath226 to be the base @xmath4 representation of the integer @xmath65 for each vertex @xmath65 .",
    "multiplication by @xmath4 simply shifts the base @xmath4 representation left by one digit , adding @xmath246 shifts in an arbitrary new digit @xmath247 and modding by @xmath248 truncates to @xmath5 digits base @xmath4 .",
    "more generally , we can write any @xmath249 in the form @xmath250 where @xmath251 and @xmath252 and @xmath4 are relatively prime , _ i.e. _ @xmath253",
    ". we can then represent any vertex @xmath254 in mixed - base form as @xmath255 as before , the transformation rule associated with edges ( [ eq : gdb ] ) shifts the @xmath150 s left .",
    "this transformation rule takes @xmath256 where @xmath257 since @xmath4 and @xmath252 are relatively prime , multiplication by @xmath4 is invertable mod @xmath252 , so that for any fixed @xmath258 the map defined in ( [ eq : fmap ] ) from @xmath259 is a one - to - one map .",
    "in particular , given @xmath260 there exists a unique @xmath261 such that ( [ eq : fmap ] ) is satisfied .",
    "this demonstrates that the map from the generalized de bruijn graph with @xmath242 vertices to the regular de bruijn with @xmath8 vertices given by dropping the first digit @xmath262 in ( [ eq : db - mixed ] ) has the parent distribution property ( [ eq : pdp ] ) .",
    "this map also clearly has the child distribution property ( [ eq : cdp ] ) , which follows from the fact that the children of any node with mixed - base representation @xmath263 are just @xmath264 with @xmath265 given by ( [ eq : fmap ] ) and @xmath266 .",
    "since this map has both the parent and child distribution properties , so does any map to a smaller de bruijn formed by the composition of this map with a map @xmath267 also having the parent and child distribution properties .",
    "this shows that the tiles which can be used to construct tilings of standard de bruijn and kautz graphs in theorem 3 of the previous section can also be used to tile generalized de bruijn graphs .",
    "we give some examples of such tilings in section [ sec : examples ]      similar to the generalized de bruijn graphs defined through ( [ eq : gdb ] ) , a kautz graph of degree @xmath4 having @xmath242 vertices can be defined by taking the directed graph on vertices @xmath243 with edges @xmath268 to relate this to the standard kautz graph in the case @xmath269 , we again introduce a mixed mode representation for each vertex @xmath65 , writing @xmath270 with @xmath271 .",
    "we denote the digits in this mixed mode representation by @xmath272 where the last digit is @xmath273 if @xmath5 is odd , and @xmath274 if @xmath5 is even .",
    "the barred digits are defined to be @xmath275 , giving a shift register representation of the vertices . from ( [ eq : gk ] ) we see that the graph edges are given by @xmath276 where @xmath277 in particular , if we choose @xmath278 , we have @xmath279 , so @xmath280 , which is precisely the transformation rule on edges in ( [ eq : relabeling ] ) if we identify @xmath281 . thus , when @xmath278 we have the standard kautz graph , while for other @xmath252 we have a generalization .    as in the previous subsection",
    ", the invertibility of multiplication by @xmath4 mod @xmath252 guarantees that the map to a @xmath8 node de bruijn given by dropping the first digit @xmath262 in the mixed mode representation ( [ eq : gk - mixed ] ) has the parent and child distribution properties , and therefore the generalized kautz graphs can also be tiled using the methods of the previous section .",
    "examples are given in the following section .",
    "in this section we give some explicit examples of tilings constructed using the discrete differential method of theorem 3 .",
    "let us first consider tilings of de bruijn graphs with @xmath51 by tiles of size 4 .",
    "the de bruijn graph @xmath282 is shown in figure  [ f : dk22 ] . up to graph isomorphisms there are 4 kinds of loops in this graph : @xmath283 , \\;\\;\\ ; [ 00 \\rightarrow 01 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 00 ] , \\;\\;\\ ; [ 00 \\rightarrow 01 \\leftarrow 10 \\rightarrow 00 ] , \\;\\;\\ ; [ 00 \\rightarrow 01 \\rightarrow 11 \\rightarrow 10 \\rightarrow 00 ] , % % \\label{eq:}\\ ] ] where the second and third loops differ only in the orientation of the link connecting @xmath236 and 10",
    ". all these loops are non - stratifiable .",
    "thus , there are no stratifiable tiles given by subgraphs of @xmath282 with more edges than the tile with 3 edges : @xmath284 this tile therefore gives a scalable tiling which solves problem 3 for @xmath285 . as an example of a tiling using this tile ,",
    "consider the tiling of @xmath286 using the map @xmath66 described using discrete differentials ( [ eq : dd - map ] ) .",
    "this tiling is depicted in figure  [ f : d23 ] . in this figure",
    "the numbers in brackets are the addresses @xmath287 for each node as in ( [ eq : labeling - d ] ) .",
    "the colored / bold links are those realized on a tile @xmath42 described by ( [ eq : tile-22 ] ) .",
    "let us now consider simple examples of a kautz graph tiling with @xmath288 .",
    "the optimal size 4 ( @xmath289 ) tile for @xmath51 again has no loops and has only 3 edges .",
    "we can , for example choose the stratified subgraph of @xmath282 containing edges @xmath290 , with @xmath291 .",
    "we can use the discrete differential map ( [ eq : dd - kautz ] ) @xmath292 to label the vertices of the kautz graph @xmath293 by @xmath294 .",
    "the tiling associated with this map is depicted in figure  [ f : k23 - 4 ] , where nodes are labeled by @xmath295 ( the nodes are , however , ordered according to the index @xmath65 from ( [ eq : gk ] ) ) . in this figure , again colored / bold links are realized on a tile @xmath42 .",
    "the direction of each link is indicated by using dotted lines on the outgoing part of the link and solid lines on the incoming part of the link .    for @xmath51 ,",
    "up to relabeling there is only one function of the form ( [ eq : f ] ) with the desired properties , which is the one used in the definition ( [ eq : dcc ] ) of discrete differentials . for @xmath296 ,",
    "it is easy to check that up to relabeling of the integers , which is a symmetry of both the de bruijn and kautz graphs , there are precisely two distinct functions with the desired properties : @xmath297 and @xmath298 either of these functions can be used to construct tilings with @xmath296 .",
    "now , for @xmath296 , consider the tile with @xmath299 .",
    "the de bruijn graph here is just the 3 vertices @xmath300 with edges going from each vertex to each other vertex .",
    "the largest subgraph without directed loops has two edges , such as @xmath301 .",
    "this defines the best tile for a scalable tiling .",
    "now consider @xmath289 .",
    "a systematic analysis of possible stratifiable subgraphs of @xmath302 shows that the maximum number of edges compatible with stratifiability is 11 , which can be realized for example by the tile depicted in figure  [ f : tile-32 ] .",
    "this tile has 4 loops of length 4 ( of which 3 are homotopically independent ) , all of which are of height 1 .",
    "tilings of the generalized de bruijn and kautz graphs with 18 nodes by two copies of this tile are shown in figures  [ f : d9 - 18 ] and  [ f : k9 - 18 ] . in these figures",
    "the node numbers are the numbers @xmath65 used in the description of generalized de bruijn and kautz graphs in section [ sec : generalized ] .",
    "we have carried out a systematic analysis of all tiles for small values of @xmath47 .",
    "we have computed the optimal tiles by performing a complete search over all possibilities in all cases where @xmath303 .",
    "our results are tabulated here .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this table we denote with an asterisk ( * ) cases where the tile is known to be optimal .",
    "the @xmath304 tile with 42 internal edges may also be optimal ; we have not found a better tile using heuristic search methods . for most of the other small tiles ,",
    "we have found slightly better tiles than those constructed using this method with brute force or greedy algorithm searches , or by slight modifications of the score - based stratification algorithm described above ; for example as mentioned above for the @xmath305 tile we have found a tile with 150 internal edges .",
    "for larger tiles , we do not know of any general method for generating tiles with significantly more internal edges . as we now discuss",
    ", we expect that the asymptotic behavior of these tiles may be the optimal achievable .",
    "note , however , that for larger values of @xmath4 the approach to the asymptotic form is slower and the tiles produced by this method are somewhat sub - optimal .",
    "in particular , when @xmath4 is large and @xmath57 is small , many nodes have no digits @xmath306 , which leads to extra broken edges",
    ". this might be improved by some heuristic method combining such nodes into sub - tiles which are then attached to increase total edge numbers .",
    "but , as @xmath71 , for any fixed @xmath4 the fraction of such nodes goes to 0 exponentially as @xmath307^m$ ] , so this issue does not affect the asymptotics .",
    "note that in @xcite a somewhat similar approach was taken to tiling degree 2 de bruijn graphs @xmath308 . in the language of score - based tiles used here ,",
    "the tilings described in that paper can be defined by assigning a score of @xmath309 when @xmath310 and @xmath311 otherwise , with ties broken by choosing @xmath139 to be the largest @xmath65 with @xmath309 .",
    "as described in @xcite , this gives a tile for @xmath312 with @xmath313 internal edges ( compared to 42 from the table above for the system defined here ) .",
    "the tiles described in @xcite also do not have good asymptotic behavior , although as mentioned in that paper a generalization of their approach to match longer sequences can improve behavior in a fixed range of @xmath5 .",
    "we now analyze the asymptotic behavior of the number of broken edges in the @xmath4-ary expansion score - based tiles for fixed @xmath4 as @xmath314 .",
    "we find that these tiles have the same asymptotic form for the number of broken edges as the lower bound ( [ eq : lower - bound ] ) , multiplied by an overall factor of @xmath315 .",
    "this asymptotic behavior can be understood from a simple idealized model for the score - based tiles .",
    "we give a simple proof of the asymptotics of the number of broken edges in this idealized model , and then describe how the tiles just defined deviate from the idealized model and the consequences of these deviations for the asymptotic form of the number of broken edges . in section [ sec : numerical - asymptotics ] we numerically analyze the score - based tiles and compare to the theoretical asymptotics .",
    "consider an infinite random walk on the de bruijn graph @xmath124 underlying a given tile .",
    "such a random walk will on average traverse each edge an equal number of times , so the fraction of edges traversed which are broken will be equal to the fraction of broken edges on the tile . in an idealized model of the score - based tile system described in the previous subsection , we assume that each node of size @xmath57 has scores @xmath316 which are uniformly and independently distributed random numbers between 0 and 1 .",
    "we assume that the scores are completely local , so that a node with the score sequence @xmath317 has children with score sequences @xmath318 for various values of @xmath319 . in the idealized model we can associate the random walk on the de bruijn graph underlying the tile with an infinite sequence of numbers @xmath320 , each chosen from a uniform random distribution on the set @xmath321 .",
    "the values of @xmath195 correspond to the sequence of scores @xmath322 on the nodes encountered in the random walk ( while for @xmath316 we used the convention that the smallest @xmath323 determined the level of a node , we reverse this convention for the @xmath183 s to simplify the computations below ) . in this idealization",
    "we ignore correlations between the values of @xmath316 at different points @xmath65 , so each @xmath195 is chosen independently from the uniform distribution .",
    "we associate each `` node '' in the random walk with a subsequence of @xmath57 numbers @xmath324 @xmath325 . in this model , there are no ties .",
    "an edge ( @xmath326 , @xmath327 ) is broken only if either @xmath181 or @xmath328 is greater than all of @xmath329 .",
    "heuristically , the chances of either occurrence are @xmath330 , giving a probability of broken edges of @xmath331 .    to make this computation more precise , for each consecutive subsequence of @xmath57 numbers @xmath324 @xmath332 representing a node we assign a level @xmath139 where @xmath333 is the largest value in the subsequence .",
    "we thus have a sequence of values @xmath334 defining the positions of the largest @xmath183 s in each subsequence @xmath335 .",
    "if a value @xmath333 is the largest @xmath183 in subsequence @xmath335 , and also is the largest @xmath183 in @xmath336 , then @xmath337 .",
    "we say that the sequence has a `` broken edge '' at position @xmath65 when @xmath338",
    ". we can now show    * theorem 4 * in this idealized model , as @xmath71 the probability of a broken edge asymptotically approaches @xmath331 .    * proof *    consider the set of `` local maximum '' @xmath195 s which are maximum values in some subsequence @xmath339 in which they are contained .",
    "there is a broken edge precisely when the maximum @xmath183 in one subsequence @xmath335 is replaced by a new maximum @xmath340 in the subsequence @xmath336 .",
    "thus , the frequency of broken edges is the same as the frequency of local maxima . for a given number @xmath183",
    "we can determine the probability that it is the largest @xmath183 in a window of size precisely @xmath246 .",
    "for example , @xmath341 is the largest in a window of size precisely 1 when @xmath342 .",
    "this occurs with probability @xmath343 .",
    "@xmath183 is the largest in a window of size precisely 2 when either @xmath344 or the symmetric condition with @xmath345 but @xmath346 .",
    "the probability that @xmath183 is largest in a window of size 2 is therefore @xmath347 .",
    "a similar set of conditions give @xmath246 independent cases with probability @xmath348 where @xmath183 is the maximum in a window of size @xmath246 .",
    "integrating over all possible @xmath183 , the probability that a given @xmath183 will be largest in a window of precisely size @xmath246 is @xmath349 = \\frac{2}{(m + 1 ) ( m + 2 ) }   \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the frequency of local maxima is then @xmath350 this proves that in the idealized model the frequency of broken edges is @xmath351 .",
    "this result in the idealized model suggests that the smallest fraction of broken edges we can achieve in a tile based on local patterns in the node address is asymptotically @xmath331 .",
    "now let us consider the relevant differences between the idealized model and the @xmath4-ary score - based tiles defined in the previous subsection .",
    "there are three primary ways in which the score - based tiles we have defined deviate from the idealized model .",
    "first , there are some situations in which different positions have the same score @xmath352 for a fixed node .",
    "second , the scores are not completely independent .",
    "third , the scores @xmath316 depend on multiple local symbols @xmath353 , and therefore in particular the score associated with a point @xmath65 in a node does not necessarily stay invariant in the children of that node we have @xmath354 along an edge @xmath33 whenever the final symbol in @xmath34 is not @xmath355 .",
    "let us treat these deviations from the idealized model in order .",
    "first , consider the situation of ties .",
    "generally , ties will increase the frequency of broken edges .",
    "for example , consider the variation on the above model where @xmath195 is chosen randomly from a uniform distribution on the discrete set @xmath356 , and ties are broken by choosing @xmath334 to be the smallest @xmath139 with the maximum value of @xmath333 in the set @xmath335 .",
    "then when @xmath357 , the frequency of broken edges will be @xmath358 .",
    "( the approach taken in @xcite is an extreme example of this ; their rule for constructing tiles can be formulated in the language of scores as described above by taking a score which is either @xmath309 if @xmath359 or @xmath311 otherwise .",
    "this gives a frequency of broken edges of 1/4 for large @xmath57 . )",
    "as noted above , for the @xmath4-ary score based tiles defined in [ sec : score - tiles ] , ties only occur for nodes with @xmath360 . the total number of nodes where such ties occur is @xmath361 the fraction of nodes where ties happen therefore decreases exponentially in @xmath57 as @xmath362^m\\ll 1/m$ ] when @xmath71 .",
    "the consequences of ties are therefore negligible in the asymptotic behavior of the number of broken edges .",
    "next , let us consider the other two issues : the lack of independence between nearby scores and the non - invariance of scores when edges are followed .",
    "each of these effects arises from dependence of the score @xmath316 on all the symbols @xmath363 for any @xmath364 . from the form of",
    "( [ eq : phi - score ] ) we see that the effect of @xmath363 on the score @xmath316 is suppressed exponentially as @xmath365 . for a node in a tile of size @xmath57 , the average spacing between the scores of the @xmath57 different positions @xmath65 is @xmath330 .",
    "thus , the impact of @xmath363 becomes negligible compared to this spacing when @xmath366 . another way to see",
    "this is to note that the smallest @xmath323 will arise from the longest sequence of 0 s in the node which is preceded by the symbol @xmath355 . as @xmath71",
    ", the average number of sequences of @xmath97 zeros in a random node address goes as @xmath367 .",
    "thus , we expect @xmath368 sequences of @xmath369 0 s but @xmath370 sequences of @xmath371 times this many 0 s .",
    "so again , the number of relevant digits in determining the minimum @xmath323 is of order @xmath372 .",
    "the relevant correlation distance between @xmath323 s is thus also @xmath369 .",
    "similarly , when a new digit sequence giving the lowest @xmath323 is being shifted in from the right , asymptotically of order @xmath372 digits must be shifted in to realize the smaller value of @xmath323 .",
    "the upshot of this analysis is that there are corrections to the asymptotic form of the idealized model of order @xmath373 when we consider the score - based tiles described above .",
    "the most important of these effects is the delay by @xmath369 digits in shifting in a new score @xmath316 . when @xmath374 , @xmath316 will be higher than the appropriately shifted value in any of the descendants of a given node due to the boundary condition @xmath375 for @xmath376 described below ( [ eq : phi - score ] )",
    "this means that the effective size of the window associated with the tile is really @xmath377 , which contributes a correction term of order @xmath373 to the asymptotic form of the fraction of broken edges @xmath331 for the idealized model demonstrated in theorem 4 .",
    "because all of these effects are either exponentially suppressed in @xmath57 or suppressed by a factor of @xmath373 relative to the leading @xmath331 , none of these effects will modify the asymptotic form of the number of broken edges for the score - based tiles described above .",
    "we now verify this analysis with numerical computation .      to verify the asymptotic analysis performed in the previous subsection , and the validity of the approximations made in going from the score - based tiling system to the idealized model , we have done a numerical analysis of the number of broken edges for tiles with small @xmath4 and reasonably large @xmath57 .",
    "this data corresponds closely with the theoretical analysis just performed .    in figure",
    "[ f : numbers-2 ] we have graphed the logarithm of the number of broken edges in the 2-ary expansion score - based tiles for @xmath378 .",
    "the number of broken edges in these tiles matches very closely to the theoretically estimated fraction of @xmath331 , and lies above the asymptotic form of the minimum fraction @xmath330 .",
    "note that for @xmath379 , the number of broken edges exceeds the fraction @xmath331 of the total number of edges .",
    "this is compatible , however , with the expected @xmath373 form of the corrections to the asymptotic form computed above . for @xmath379",
    "the computed number of broken edges lies between the asymptotic form @xmath331 and the log - corrected asymptotic form @xmath380 .    for tiles with @xmath296 we have a similar close match to the asymptotic fraction @xmath331 of broken edges ,",
    "as depicted in figure  [ f : numbers-3 ] .    to summarize , from our analysis of an idealized model",
    ", we expect that a fraction of @xmath331 broken edges is asymptotically the optimum which can be achieved based on a local pattern for level determination .",
    "we have constructed a family of tiles which realize this asymptotic form , and are thus asymptotically optimal for local pattern - based tile structures .",
    "this asymptotic result differs from the lower bound computed in section [ sec : asymptotic ] by a factor of 2 .",
    "we suspect that it is not possible to find tilings with an asymptotic fraction of less than @xmath331 broken edges , based on our asymptotic analysis and brute force and greedy algorithm analysis of small tiles , but we have not proven this conclusively . any mechanism for constructing tiles with an asymptotic fraction of",
    "@xmath381 broken edges with @xmath382 would require a means of determining the level of each node based on global properties of the @xmath383 node address , like some kind of global hashing function , rather than a determination of level based on local patterns such as we have considered here .",
    "the results of this paper give not only a theoretical understanding of how de bruijn and kautz graphs can be decomposed into isomorphic subgraph tiles , but also a concrete approach to constructing such tilings .",
    "computer systems containing thousands of individual processing elements need efficient communication networks to minimize overhead in passing data between the processors . because of their high degree of connectivity , de bruijn and",
    "kautz graphs are very well suited to such large scale processing networks .",
    "the practical problem of wiring together many processors in such a network is substantially simplified by the approach of combining multiple processing units into tiles with isomorphic wiring , and then combining the tiles as we have described in this paper .    in principle , the methods described in this paper can be used to design wiring systems for computing systems at a range of scales . for",
    "any given size of system , the tradeoff between communication and processing power will affect the choice of degree @xmath4 , and practical design considerations will affect the choice of tile size @xmath56 .",
    "the results described here should be useful in determining the complexity of wiring needed for any such system design .",
    "in particular , the lower bound on edges connecting tiles derived in section [ sec : asymptotic ] gives an absolute lower limit on the complexity of wiring necessary for such a system .",
    "the explicit tile constructions given here give concrete examples of wiring patterns which can be used for such systems .",
    "the feasibility of a practical implementation of the tiling methods developed in this paper is demonstrated by the sicortex , inc .",
    "family of cluster computer systems @xcite . the internal communication network in these systems is based on a degree @xmath296 kautz digraph .",
    "circuit boards contain processor notes connected in a stratified subgraph of a degree 3 , diameter 3 de bruijn digraph , so that a full kautz graph of any desired size can be wired by connecting identical boards as described in theorem 3 , taking advantage of the parallel routing property .",
    "in this paper we have developed a systematic approach to partitioning de bruijn and kautz graphs into isomorphic subgraph `` tiles '' connected by a minimal number of additional edges .",
    "these results utilize the common mathematical structure underlying de bruijn and kautz graphs , and shed light on the structure of these graphs and their generalizations .",
    "the tilings we have constructed here have practical application to the construction of massively parallel computer systems .",
    "we have given necessary and sufficient conditions for constructing efficient tilings , we have characterized optimal tiles in terms of de bruijn graphs of the size of the desired tile , and we have constructed an asymptotically optimal class of tilings .",
    "we have not , however , found a general method for explicitly constructing provably optimal tiles of arbitrary size , nor have we found a general formula for the number of internal edges achievable by an optimal tile of arbitrary size .",
    "we leave these open problems for future work ."
