    "interferometers are widely used for astronomical observations as they provide high angular resolutions and large collecting areas .",
    "existing interferometers in the radio ( e.g. the very large array ( vla ) , the berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) , etc . ) and in the optical band ( e.g. , the center for high angular resolution astronomy ( chara ) , the palomar testbed interferometer , the keck interferometer , the very large telescope ( vlt ) interferometer , etc . )",
    "will soon be complemented by new facilities such as the expanded very large array ( evla ) , the square kilometer array ( ska ) , the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , and the low frequency array ( lofar ) .",
    "interferometers are now also being developed to produce maps of the cosmic microwave background on small scales ( e.g. , the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) , the array for microwave background anisotropy ( amiba ) , the very small array ( vsa ) , etc ) .",
    "interferometric arrays , however , do not provide a direct image of the observed sky , but instead measure its fourier transform at a finite number of discrete samplings , or ` @xmath0 ' points , corresponding to each antenna pair in the array .",
    "the image in real space must therefore be reconstructed from the @xmath0 plane by inverse fourier transform while deconvolving the effective beam arising from the finite sampling ( see thompson et al .",
    "1986 , perley et al .",
    "1989 , and taylor et al .",
    "1999 for reviews ) .",
    "for this purpose several elaborate methods have been developed .",
    "for instance , the commonly used cleaning algorithm implemented in the nrao aips software package ( hogbom 1974 ; schwarz 1978 ; clark 1980 ; cornwell 1983 ) , relies on successive subtraction of real - space delta functions from the @xmath0 plane .",
    "another method is based on maximum entropy ( e.g. , cornwell & evans 1985 ) and consists of finding the simplest image consistent with the @xmath0 data .",
    "these methods are well - tested and appropriate for various applications ; however , the methods are non - linear and do not necessarily converge in a well - defined manner .",
    "consequently , they are not well - suited for quantitative image shape measurements requiring high precision . in particular , weak gravitational lensing ( see mellier 1999 ; bartelmann & schneider 2000 for reviews ) requires the statistical measurements of weak distortions in the shapes of background objects and thus can not afford the instabilities and potential biases inherent in these methods . while interferometric surveys offer great promises for weak lensing ( kamionkowski et al .",
    "1998 ; refregier et al 1998 ; schneider 1999 ) , a different approach for shape measurements is therefore required to achieve the necessary accuracy and control of systematics .    in this paper , we present a new method for reconstructing images from interferometric observations .",
    "it is based on the formalism introduced by refregier ( 2001 , paper i ) and refregier & bacon ( 2001 , paper ii ) , in which object shapes are decomposed into orthonormal shape components , or ` shapelets ' .",
    "the hermite basis functions used in this approach have a number of remarkable properties which greatly facilitate the modeling of object shapes .",
    "in particular , they are invariant under fourier transformation ( up to a rescaling ) and are thus a natural choice for interferometric imaging .",
    "we show how shapelet components can be directly fitted on the @xmath0 plane to reconstruct an interferometric image .",
    "the fit is linear in the shapelet coefficients and can thus be performed by simple matrix multiplications . since the shapelet components of all sources are fitted simultaneously ,",
    "cross - talk between different sources ( e.g. , when the sidelobe from one source falls at the position of a second source ) are avoided , or at least quantified .",
    "the method also provides the full covariance matrix of the shapelet coefficients , and is robust .",
    "we also show how the complex effects of bandwidth smearing , time averaging and non - coplanarity of the array can be easily and fully corrected for in our method .",
    "our method is thus well - suited for applications requiring unbiased , high - precision measurements of object shapes .",
    "in particular , we show how the method can be combined with the results of paper ii to provide a clean measurement of weak gravitational lensing with interferometers .",
    "we test our methods using both observations from the first radio survey ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ; white et al . 1997 ) and numerical simulations corresponding to the observing conditions of that survey .",
    "we also show how our method can be implemented on parallel computers and discuss its performance in comparison with the cleaning method .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ shapelets ] , we first summarize the relevant features of the shapelet method . in  [ method ] , we describe how shapelets can be applied to image reconstruction with interferometers . in  [ results ] , we discuss tests of the method using both simulated and real first observations . in",
    " [ lensing ] we show how our method can be used for weak lensing applications . our conclusions are summarized in ",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "we begin by summarizing the relevant components of the shapelet method described in paper i. in this approach , the surface brightness @xmath2 of an object is decomposed as @xmath3 where @xmath4^{\\frac{1}{2}}}\\ ] ] are the two - dimensional orthonormal hermite basis functions of characteristic scale @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the hermite polynomial of order m , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the basis is complete and yields fast convergence in the expansion if @xmath5 and @xmath9 are , respectively , close to the size and location of the object .",
    "the basis functions can be thought of as perturbations around a two - dimensional gaussian , and are thus natural bases for describing the shapes of most astronomical objects .",
    "they are also the eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) , allowing us to use the powerful formalism developed for that problem .",
    "a similar decomposition scheme using laguerre basis functions has been independently proposed by bernstein & jarvis ( 2001 ) .",
    "the hermite basis functions have remarkable mathematical properties .",
    "in particular , let us consider the fourier transform of an object intensity , @xmath10 .",
    "it can be decomposed as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 are the fourier - transforms of the basis functions , which obey the dual property @xmath13 from the orthonomality of the basis functions , the coefficients are given by @xmath14 this invariance ( up to a rescaling ) under fourier transformation ( eq .  [",
    "[ eq : duality ] ] ) makes this basis set a natural choice for interferometric imaging .",
    "in this section , we describe how shapelets can be applied to interferometric imaging .",
    "we first briefly discuss how images are mapped onto the @xmath0 plane by interferometers .",
    "we also show how the @xmath0 plane can be binned into cells to reduce computation time and memory requirements .",
    "we then describe how the shapelet coefficients can be directly fit onto the binned @xmath0 plane using a linear @xmath1 procedure .",
    "finally , we describe how the resulting shapelet coefficients can be optimally combined to reconstruct the image , to co - add several pointings , and to measure shape parameters .",
    "an interferometer consists of an array of antennae whose output signals are correlated to measure a complex ` visibility ' for each antenna pair ( see thompson et al .",
    "1986 , perley et al .",
    "1989 , and taylor et al .",
    "1999 for reviews ) .",
    "each visibility is then assigned a point on the ` @xmath0 plane ' corresponding to the two - dimensional spacings between the antennae . in practice ,",
    "the visibilities are close to , but not exactly equal to a two - dimensional fourier transform of the sky brightness . within the conventions of perley ,",
    "schwab & bridle ( 1989 ) for the vla , the visibility measured for the antenna pair @xmath15 at time @xmath16 and at frequency @xmath17 is indeed given by @xmath18},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the surface brightness of the sky at position @xmath20 with respect to the phase center , and @xmath21 is the ( frequency - dependent ) primary beam .",
    "for the vla , the primary beam power pattern can be well - approximated as the bessel function @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath17 is the observation frequency and @xmath24 is the position offset from the phase center ( condon et al .",
    "the @xmath25 coordinates are given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the wavelength of observation , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the hour angle and declination of the phase center , and @xmath30 are the coordinate differences for the two antennas .",
    "the latter are measured in a fixed - earth coordinate system , for which the sky rotates about the @xmath31 axis .",
    "note that the @xmath32 positions of the visibilities define the synthesized beam pattern .",
    "since the @xmath32 coordinates are entirely determined by the antenna positions , source coordinates , and time and frequency of the observations , the synthesized beam is precisely known for interforemeters .    only in the absence of a primary beam ( @xmath33 ) , for observations at zenith ( @xmath34 ) , and for small displacements from the phase center ( @xmath35 ) , does the visibility reduce to an exact fourier transform of the intensity . furthermore , the visibilities are measured in practice by averaging over small time and frequency intervals .",
    "the resulting averaged visibility is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the time and frequency window functions , respectively , and are normalized as @xmath39 . because the time and frequency intervals are typically very small , this double integral",
    "can be evaluated by taylor expanding @xmath40 about the central values @xmath41 and @xmath42 of the window functions . for square - hat window functions of width @xmath43 ( exact ) and @xmath44 ( approximate ) , respectively , we obtain @xmath45 + \\cdots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when the telescope points to a fixed location on the sky , the hour angle of the phase center changes as @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the angular frequency of the earth . on the other hand ,",
    "the declination @xmath29 of the phase center remains constant .",
    "the above expression for @xmath48 can thus be computed analytically , leaving the two - dimensional @xmath49-integral to evaluate numerically .",
    "note that this provides a direct and complete treatment of primary beam attenuation , time - averaging , bandwidth smearing and non - coplanarity of the array .",
    "these effects are difficult to correct for in the context of the standard cleaning method .      in practice",
    ", the number of visibilities per observation is large ( @xmath50 ) . directly fitting the shape parameters to all @xmath0 points",
    "would thus require prohibitively large computing time and memory .",
    "instead , we use a binning scheme to reduce the effective number of @xmath0 points without loosing information . in the @xmath0 plane",
    ", we set a grid of size @xmath51 and average the visibilities inside each cell , where @xmath52 is one - half of the intended field of view , and the factor @xmath53 accounts for the nyquist frequency .",
    "the choice of @xmath54 is designed both to minimize the number of cells and to avoid smearing at large angular scales , which would otherwise act like an effective primary beam attenuation .",
    "we thus calculate the average visibility in the @xmath0 cell @xmath55 ( of size @xmath54 ) as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of visibilities in the cell .",
    "this is the data we will use to reconstruct the image .",
    "we now wish to model the intensity @xmath58 of each source @xmath59 as a sum of shapelet basis functions @xmath60 centered on the source centroid @xmath61 , and scale @xmath62 .",
    "our goal is to estimate the shapelet coefficients @xmath63 of the sources given the binned @xmath0 data @xmath64 .",
    "( we will describe how the centroid and shapelet scales are chosen in practice in  [ sim ] ) . in principle , the full @xmath0 plane provides complete shape information for the sources .",
    "however , due to the finite number and non - uniform spacings of the antennae , the @xmath0 ( fourier ) space is poorly sampled , thus hampering the decomposition .",
    "this prevents us from performing a simple linear decomposition as is done with optical images in real space ( see paper i ) .",
    "this problem can be largely resolved by making a linear fit to the @xmath0 plane with the shapelet coefficients as the free parameters .    for this purpose ,",
    "the first step is to compute the binned visibilities @xmath65 corresponding to each shapelet basis functions @xmath66 for each source @xmath59 .",
    "this can be done by first computing the time- and frequency - averaged visibility @xmath67 by setting @xmath68 in equations  ( [ eq : v_ij ] ) and ( [ eq : v_ij_bar ] ) . to prevent potential biases introduced by the binning scheme",
    ", we evaluate the basis functions at every visibility point and then average them inside each cell to compute @xmath65 just as in equation  ( [ eq : v_c ] ) .",
    "note that this ensures that the systematic distortions induced by the primary beam , bandwidth smearing , time - averaging and non - coplanarity can all be fully corrected in our method .",
    "the next step is to form and minimize @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the data vector , @xmath71 is the theory matrix , and @xmath72 is the parameter vector . the covariance error matrix @xmath73 = \\left\\langle ( { \\mathbf d } - \\langle { \\mathbf d } \\rangle)^{t}{(\\mathbf d } - \\langle { \\mathbf d } \\rangle ) \\right\\rangle\\ ] ] for the binned visibilities can be estimated in practice either from the distribution of the visibilities in each bin or from the error tables provided by the interferometric hardware .",
    "because the model is linear in the fitting parameters , the best - fit parameters @xmath74 can be computed analytically as ( e.g. , lupton 1993 ) @xmath75 the covariance error matrix @xmath76 $ ] of the best - fit parameters is given by @xmath77 this provides us with an estimate for the shapelet coefficients for each source and for their full covariance matrix .",
    "note that all sources are fitted simultaneously thus avoiding ( or at least quantifying ) potential cross - talk between different sources ( e.g. , when a sidelobe from one source falls at the position of a second source ) .",
    "the coefficient covariance matrix can also be used to determine degeneracies produce by the finite @xmath0 sampling of the array .",
    "now that we have derived estimates @xmath78 for the shapelet coefficients @xmath79 for each source in a pointing , we can combine them to construct an image and to compute useful quantities such as the fluxes , centroids and sizes of the sources .",
    "we first consider the practical problem of co - adding several pointings to derive an optimal image of a source .",
    "let @xmath80 be the coefficients of a source derived from pointing @xmath81 , and let @xmath82 be the associated covariance error matrix ( from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cova ] ) ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the error in the co - added coefficients @xmath78 will be minimized if they are given by the weighted sum @xmath83 the covariance error matrix @xmath84 $ ] of the co - added coefficients are then given by @xmath85    we can then find an optimal weighting to reconstruct the image of a source from the estimated coefficients @xmath78 . to do so we seek the reconstructed coefficients given by @xmath86 the weights @xmath87 are chosen so that the reconstructed image @xmath88 is ` as close as possible ' to the true image @xmath89 , in the sense that the least - square difference @xmath90 ^ 2 =     \\sum_{\\mathbf n } [ f^{r}_{\\mathbf n } - f_{\\mathbf n } ] ^{2}\\ ] ] is minimized .",
    "it is easy to show that this will be the case when @xmath91 where the right - hand side provides an approximation which can be directly derived from the data .",
    "this weighting amounts to wiener filtering in shapelet space , in analogy with that performed in fourier space ( see , e.g. , press et al .",
    "figures [ fig : sim ] and [ fig : data ] show several reconstructed images using this weighting scheme . note that this produces an estimate for the _ deconvolved _ image of the source . for display purposes , it is sometimes useful to smooth the reconstructed image by a gaussian kernel ( the restoring beam in radio parlance ) .",
    "this can easily be done in shapelet space by multiplying the coefficients by the analytic smoothing matrix described in paper i.    while wiener filtering yields an optimal image reconstruction , it is _ not _ to be used to measure source parameters such as flux , centroid , size , etc . instead , an unbiased estimator for shape parameters can be derived directly from the shapelet coefficients ( see paper i ) .",
    "for instance , an estimate for the flux @xmath92 of a source is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 if @xmath95 and @xmath96 are both even ( and vanishes otherwise ) .",
    "the variance uncertainty in the flux is then simply @xmath97 = { \\mathbf a}^{t } { \\mathbf w } { \\mathbf a},\\ ] ] which provides a robust estimate of the signal - to - noise snr@xmath98 $ ] of the source .",
    "similar expressions can be used to compute the centroid and rms size of the source .",
    "this can be easily generalized to compute in addition the major and minor axes of the source and its position angle .",
    "note that these expressions are , again , estimates for deconvolved quantities .",
    "as an application , we consider the first radio survey ( becker et al . 1995 ; white et al .",
    "1997 ) , being conducted with the vla at 1.4 ghz in the b configuration . for this survey ,",
    "the primary beam fwhm is @xmath99 30@xmath100 and the angular resolution is @xmath101 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the survey currently contains about @xmath102 sources with a @xmath103 flux - density limit of 1.0 mjy over @xmath104 deg@xmath105 ; the mean source redshift is @xmath106 .",
    "observing time has been allocated to extend its coverage to 9,000 deg@xmath105 . the survey is composed of 165-second ` grid - pointings ' with a time - averaging interval @xmath107 seconds .",
    "it was conducted in the spectral synthesis mode , with a channel bandwidth of @xmath108 3 mhz . because this wide - field survey was performed in the snapshot mode ,",
    "its @xmath0 sampling is very sparse .",
    "this makes shape reconstruction particularly challenging for first , providing a good test for our method .    as explained in ",
    "[ interferometers ] , higher order effects such as bandwidth smearing and time - averaging produce small distortions in the reconstructed image shapes if they are left uncounted for .",
    "these must be carefully corrected for high - precision statistical measurements of object shapes such as those required in weak lensing surveys .",
    "the effects are , however , very small and not noticeable on an object - by - object basis .",
    "for the purpose of this test , we thus ignore these effects and instead focus on the dominant factor in shape reconstruction , the finite and discrete @xmath0 sampling .          as a first test",
    ", we generated simulated vla data using the observational parameters of first .",
    "a grid pointing was generated at zenith with 33 5-second time - averaging intervals and 14 3-mhz channels in the b configuration .",
    "simulated sources were randomly distributed within 23@xmath100.5 of the phase center , the cutoff adopted for creating the final co - added first maps ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ) ; the number density , flux density and size distributions chosen for the sources were similar to sources in the first catalog .",
    "after generating the visibilities , we added uncorrelated gaussian noise to the real and imaginary component of each @xmath0 data point , with an rms of @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the total number of visibilities .",
    "the real - space rms noise @xmath111 was set to @xmath112 mjy beam@xmath113 , which is somewhat higher than the typical first noise level , @xmath99 0.2 mjy beam@xmath113 .",
    "we then simultaneously fitted all 23 sources in the grid pointing directly in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "we imposed the constraint that that source intensities are real ( i.e. , non - imaginary ) .",
    "each source @xmath59 was modeled as a shapelet with scale @xmath62 , maximum shapelet order @xmath114 , and center position @xmath115 . in principle , it is possible to determine these parameters with a source detection algorithm which directly uses shapelets .",
    "one can , for instance , tile ground - state shapelets with different sizes in the @xmath0 plane , and thus detect sources with different sizes .",
    "however , this is computationally expensive and , since the first catalog is conveniently available , we have not implemented this algorithm .    instead",
    ", good choices for these parameters were derived from the first catalog , which lists basic shape parameters for each source , such as its centroid , flux density , major and minor axes , and position angle , all obtained from an elliptical gaussian fit .",
    "the shapelet position @xmath115 was simply set to the centroid position from the catalog .",
    "the choices for the shapelet scales @xmath62 and maximum shapelet orders @xmath114 were derived as follows .",
    "as described in paper i , the hermite basis functions have two natural scales : @xmath116 corresponding to the overall extent of the basis functions , and @xmath117 corresponding to the smallest - scale oscillations in the basis functions .",
    "these scales are related to the shapelet scale and maximum order by @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "as @xmath120 increases , the large - scale size of the shapelet grows , while its small - scale features become finer .",
    "the shapelet thus becomes more extended both in real and in fourier space .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath116 to be the rms major axis from the first catalog , and @xmath117 to correspond to the longest baseline of the vla : @xmath99 1@xmath121.8 ( rms ) in real space .",
    "this provides us with a choice for @xmath122 and for @xmath123 for each source .    solving equation  ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) ,",
    "we then obtain the shapelet coefficients and the covariance matrix using equations  ( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : cova ] ) .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim ] , where the input images ( before the addition of noise ) , inverse fourier - transformed @xmath0 data ( ` dirty ' images ) , and shapelet - reconstructed images ( with weiner filtering , see  [ weighting ] ) of three of the sources are shown .",
    "each image shown is 32@xmath121 across and the resolution is about 5@xmath121.4 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the poor @xmath0 sampling of first and the effect of noise are evident in the dirty images .",
    "for both resolved ( left panels ) and unresolved or marginally resolved ( right panels ) sources , the reconstructions agree with the inputs very well .",
    "the more complicated structure in the central panel is not fully recovered by shapelets .",
    "this is expected , since the small - scale structure of the source is not resolved and therefore can not be fully recovered in the reconstruction .",
    "the comparison between the input and shapelet - reconstructed flux density for all sources in the grid pointing is shown in figure  [ fig : flux ] .",
    "the shapelet flux density is given by equation  ( [ eq : flux ] ) and its 1@xmath124 error by equation  ( [ eq : error ] ) .",
    "the source flux densities are well - recovered by the shapelets in an unbiased manner .",
    "note the range of error bars at a given input flux is due to the range of source sizes .",
    "for instance , for an input flux density of about 2 mjy , the source with a relatively large error bar has a major axis of about @xmath125 ( fwhm ) , while those with small error bars are unresolved or barely resolved ( major axis fwhm @xmath126 ) . in general",
    ", we find the shapelet reconstruction from the sparsely sampled and noisy simulated data to be in good agreement with the input ( noise - free ) image .",
    "note that our method can be used to identify and discard spurious sources arising from sidelobes and other artifacts in the dirty image .",
    "indeed , when we place an extra shapelet centered at a random positions in the field , the coefficients of that shapelet are consistent with zero .    0.1 in   0.1 in      next ,",
    "we test our method by applying it to one of the first grid pointings ( 14195 + 38531 ) . for this purpose",
    ", we selected all sources within 23@xmath100.5 of the phase center from the first catalog with a measured flux density limit ( i.e. , including the primary beam response ) of 0.75 mjy .",
    "for each of the resulting 23 sources , we use the source major axis to estimate @xmath5 and @xmath120 as described in the previous section .",
    "we then simultaneously fit all the sources for the shapelet coefficients directly in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "note that the shapelet coefficients obtained are deconvolved coefficients .",
    "figure  [ fig : data ] shows the reconstruction of three representative sources in the bottom panels . also shown for comparison",
    "are the images of the sources constructed using the standard aips clean algorithm with a cleaning limit of 0.5 mjy ( central panel ) , along with the dirty images ( top panel ) .",
    "each panel is 32@xmath121 across and the fwhm of the first resolution is 5@xmath121.4",
    ". the shapelet method does not involve image pixels in the modeling ; one is therefore free to specify the pixel size when constructing the images . here",
    "the dirty and cleaned images have pixel sizes of 1@xmath121.8 , while the shapelet images have pixel sizes of 1@xmath121 and thus show finer details . for demonstration ,",
    "the shapelet reconstructions have been weiner - filtered using the resulting covariance matrix . for a direct comparison , they have also been smoothed with a gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 2@xmath121.3 , reproducing the restoring beam of the cleaned image .",
    "we find that the shapelet reconstructions compare well with the cleaned images .",
    "in further tests , we have encountered cases where a bright source ( @xmath127 mjy ) lies in or near a grid pointing .",
    "we have found that the presence of the bright source does not affect the fit of the other sources in the grid in a noticeable way .",
    "our method can thus well handle the dynamical range of the first survey , which spans more than 3-orders of magnitude . for fainter sources ( @xmath128 mjy ;",
    "i.e. , detection snr @xmath129 ) , the reconstructions are rather poor at times , in contrast to those for brighter sources ( which are almost always well fitted ) .",
    "this is of course reasonable , given the larger impact of noise for faint sources .",
    "in figure  [ fig : cova ] we display a portion of the covariance matrix for the shapelet coefficients for the nine sources in the pointing with the highest peak flux densities .",
    "the horizontal and vertical lines separate the nine sources .",
    "the diagonal line from the lower - left to the upper - right corner represents the variance of the shapelet coefficients .",
    "the block - diagonal boxes are the covariance matrix of the coefficients of the nine sources .",
    "the off - diagonal blocks quantify the cross - talk between sources .",
    "note that the correlation between coefficients are roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the variance .",
    "figure  [ fig : cova_s4 ] shows the error in the shapelet coefficients ( n1,n2 ) of the source shown in the left panels of figure  [ fig : data ] .",
    "( these errors are the diagonal segment of the 4@xmath130 diagonal box counting from the lower left in fig .",
    "[ fig : cova ] ) .",
    "in general , we find that higher-@xmath131 coefficients tend to be noisier .",
    "this is expected since convolution ( or , equivalently , @xmath0 sampling ) suppresses the small scale information encoded by coefficients with large @xmath131 ( see paper i ) .",
    "the covariance matrix thus provides us with useful information on the error in each coefficient , and quantifies cross - talk between coefficients both within and among sources .",
    "since the shapelet coefficients of all sources are simultaneously fit to a large number of visibilities , the computing memory required for the calculation is not negligible .",
    "we have implemented the method on the uk cosmos sgi origin 2000 supercomputer , which has 64 r10000 mips processors with a shared - memory structure .",
    "numerically , the shapelet coefficients can be obtained by performing simple matrix operations as in equation  ( [ eq : f ] ) , or by solving the linear least - squares problem , @xmath132 , using matrix factorization or singular value decomposition , and assuming that the data covariance matrix @xmath133 is diagonal .",
    "both methods can be efficiently parallelized . with our binning scheme , the run - time memory required for this particular first grid pointing was about 700 mb , for 23 sources and a total of 177 shapelet parameters .",
    "the cpu time required was about 26 seconds with 10 processors or about 5 minutes in scalar mode .",
    "for other grid pointings with different numbers of sources , the computation time ranges between 20 and 60 seconds with 10 processors , with a run time memory between 0.5 to 1.5 gb .",

    "there are a number of reasons to try to extend these studies to interferometric images in the radio band .",
    "firstly , the brightest radio sources are at high redshift , thereby increasing the strength of the lensing signal .",
    "secondly , radio interferometers have a well - known and deterministic convolution beam , and thus do not suffer from the irreproducible effects of atmospheric seeing .",
    "thirdly , existing surveys such as the first radio survey ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ; white el al .",
    "1997 ) provide a sparsely sampled but very wide - area survey , which offers the unique opportunity to measure a weak lensing signal on large angular scales ( kamionkowski et al .",
    "1998 ; refregier et al . 1998",
    "; see also schneider ( 1999 ) for the case of ska ) .",
    "finally , surveys at higher frequencies or in more extended antenna configurations could potentially yield very high angular resolution and are not limited by the irreducible effects of the seeing disk in ground - based optical surveys .",
    "because the distortions induced by lensing are only on the order of 1% , the shapes of background objects must be measured with high precision .",
    "in addition , systematic effects such as the convolution beam and instrumental distortions must be tightly controlled . for this purpose",
    ", a number of shear measurement methods have been developed .",
    "the original method of kaiser , squires & broadhurst ( 1995 ) was found to be acceptable for current cluster and large - scale structure surveys ( bacon et al .",
    "2000b ; erben et al .",
    "2000 ) , but are not sufficiently reliable for future high - precision surveys .",
    "consequently , several other methods have been proposed ( kuijken 1999 ; kaiser 2000 ; rhodes , refregier & groth 2000 , berstein & jarvis 2001 ) .",
    "recently , refregier & bacon ( 2001 , paper ii ) developed a new method based on shapelets and demonstrated its simplicity and accuracy for ground - based surveys .",
    "it is thus straightforward to apply this method to interferometric measurements .",
    "indeed , the shapelet coefficients @xmath79 which we derive from the fit on the @xmath0 plane ( after co - adding if required ) are already deconvolved from the effective beam and can thus be directly used to estimate the shear .",
    "this can be done using the estimators for the shear components @xmath134 and @xmath135 which are given by ( see paper ii ) @xmath136 where the sum is over even ( odd ) shapelet coefficients for @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) and the brackets denote an average over an ( unlensed ) object ensemble .",
    "the matrix @xmath137 is the shear matrix , and can be expressed as simple combinations of ladder operators in the qho formalism .",
    "these estimators for individual shapelet components are then optimally weighted and combined to provide a minimum - variance estimator for the shear .",
    "this permits us to achieve the highest possible sensitivity ( while remaining linear in the surface brightness ) by using all the available shape information of the lensed sources .    in kamionkowski",
    "( 1998 ) and refregier et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , it has been shown that the first radio survey is a unique database for measuring weak lensing by large - scale structure on large angular scales . in a future paper , we will apply the method described here to this survey , search for the lensing signal , and , from its amplitude , derive constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "we have presented a new method for image reconstruction from interferometers .",
    "our method is based on shapelet decomposition and is simple and robust .",
    "it consists of a linear fit of the shapelet coefficients directly in the @xmath0 plane , and thus permits a full correction of systematic shape distortions caused by bandwidth smearing , time - averaging and non - coplanarity .",
    "because the fit is linear in the shapelet coefficients it can be implemented as simple matrix multiplications .",
    "it provides the full covariance matrix of the shapelet coefficients which can then be used to estimate errors and cross - talk in the recovered shapes of sources .",
    "we have shown how source shapes from different pointings can be easily co - added using a weighted sum of the recovered shapelet coefficients .",
    "we have also described how the shapelet parameters could be combined to derive optimal image reconstruction , photometry , astrometry and pointing co - addition .",
    "our method can be efficiently implemented on parallel computers .",
    "we find that a fit to all the sources in a first grid pointing takes about 1 minute on an origin 2000 supercomputer with 10 processors ( 10 minutes in scalar mode ) . because we are fitting all sources simultaneously",
    ", 0.5 to 1.5 gb of memory is required .    to test our methods , we considered the observing conditions of the first radio survey ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ; white et al .",
    "1997 ) whose snapshot mode yields a sparse sampling in @xmath0 space . using numerical simulations tuned to reproduce the conditions of first",
    ", we find that the sources are well - reconstructed with our method .",
    "we have also applied our method to a first snapshot pointing and found that the shapes are well - recovered .",
    "the reconstruction of our method compares well with the clean reconstruction , without suffering the potential biases inherent in the latter method .",
    "our method is thus well - suited for applications requiring quantitative and high - precision shape measurements .",
    "in particular , our method is ideal for the measurement of the small distortions induced by gravitational lensing in the shape of background sources by intervening structures .",
    "such a measurement from cleaned images may well not be practical since the systematic distortions induced by that method are very difficult to control .",
    "( one could perhaps imagine running numerical simulations to calibrate the shear estimator , but this would be both computationally expensive and rather uncertain ) .",
    "we have shown how our results can be combined with the shear measurement method described in refregier & bacon ( 2001 ) to derive a measurement of weak lensing with interferometers .",
    "this is facilitated both by the fact that our recovered shapelet coefficients are already deconvolved from the effective ( dirty ) beam , and as a consequence of the remarkable properties of shapelets under shears .",
    "our method therefore opens the possibility of high - precision measurements of weak lensing with interferometers . while to date all weak - lensing studies",
    "have been carried using optical data ( and therefore in real space ) , an interferometric measurement of weak lensing in the radio band is very attractive ( kamionkowski et al .",
    "1998 ; refregier et al . 1998",
    "; schneider 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , the lensing signal is expected to be larger because radio sources have a higher mean redshift .",
    "in addition , such a measurement would not suffer from the irreproducible effects of atmospheric seeing .",
    "instead , the effective ( dirty ) beam is fully known for interferometers and the noise properties of the antennas are well - understood . as a result",
    ", the impact of systematic effects , the crucial limitation in the search for weak lensing , are expected to be lower with radio interferometers . in a future paper",
    ", we will describe our measurement of weak lensing by large - scale structure with the first survey using the present method .",
