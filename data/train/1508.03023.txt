    "electron diffraction probes are sensitive to such reconstructions . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] , both rheed , performed after growth at high temperature , and leed , performed at low temperature , indicate that some sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 samples with low doping levels show a @xmath54 surface reconstruction not observed by bulk x - ray diffraction . within the ionic limit at low doping ,",

    "we argue below that the observed @xmath54 reconstruction is most likely a result of the polar surface of sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , and that a polar catastrophe is avoided in this material by the formation of ordered oxygen vacancies on the topmost cuo@xmath4 plane .",

    "the measured sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 films are terminated with a cuo@xmath4 layer , and the extra rheed streaks associated with the reconstruction , shown in fig .",
    "[ figure6](b ) , become more intense during the vacuum annealing step that occurs at the end of film growth .",
    "this strongly suggests that the reconstruction is related to the removal of oxygen from the topmost cuo@xmath4 plane .",
    "indeed , half an oxygen vacancy per unit cell will change the net charge of the terminal cuo@xmath4 atomic layer from @xmath60 to @xmath59 , resulting in a cancellation of the divergent electric potential associated with alternating charged layers @xcite . under this constraint ,",
    "only one structure is consistent with a @xmath54 symmetry .",
    "one orientation of this structure is displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] , with three others related by in - plane 90@xmath17 rotations .",
    "the measured widths of both rheed streaks and leed spots indicate that such oxygen vacancy ordering persists over an in - plane length scale of at least @xmath2610 unit cells .",
    "we emphasize that the clear @xmath61 diffraction peaks in leed measurements definitively rule out the possibility that the surface consists of domains of @xmath62 and @xmath63 reconstructions , a fact greatly limiting the set of possible oxygen vacancy structures to consider . if a single domain of our proposed model existed on the film surface , an anisotropic leed structure factor would be observed . because we instead observe four - fold symmetric diffraction patterns , the films likely contain domains of all four rotational orientations .",
    "higher doping levels lead to better metallic screening of the polar electric potential divergence , and the band gap of a material can play a large role in its polar reconstruction @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural to expect the tendency towards a polar surface reconstruction to be diminished at higher doping levels .",
    "indeed , we note that for @xmath64 , about half of films showed evidence of a reconstruction either by rheed or leed , while for @xmath65 , only one out of eight films showed the phenomenon .",
    "the observed film - to - film variability at fixed doping may be related to the fact that the formation of long - range structural order at the surface of the film , necessary for observing the reconstruction with diffraction probes , is likely sensitive to temperature , oxygen partial pressure , and other growth parameters .",
    "fermi surface map for a sr@xmath66la@xmath67cuo@xmath2 film taken at 20 k showing spectral weight within @xmath68 mev and normalized to a featureless background at high binding energy .",
    "the fermi surface is composed of small electron pockets centered at @xmath37 and equivalent points .",
    "weak spectral weight visible at @xmath31 and @xmath9 is a result of shadow band reflections ( shown by yellow arrows ) due to a @xmath54 surface reconstruction in this film . ]    despite a dramatic reconstruction of the terminal cuo@xmath4 surface in sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , arpes measurements are mostly consistent with a pristine unreconstructed material , with the fermi surface enclosing the correct luttinger volume .",
    "figure [ figure8 ] shows a fermi surface map for an @xmath48 sample , identical to the top panel of fig .",
    "[ figure2](b ) , where there is some evidence of a @xmath54 reconstruction in the form of weak shadow bands at @xmath31 and @xmath9 . with this exception ,",
    "the arpes data can be analyzed without considering the reconstruction .",
    "if the model presented above is correct , the large number of oxygen vacancies on the film surface will naturally alter the valence states of the topmost copper and oxygen atoms , moving their energies away from the fermi level .",
    "low - energy photoemission on such films will therefore effectively probe the first buried cuo@xmath4 plane in the material .",
    "this will slightly suppress the photoemission intensity near the fermi level because photoelectrons must travel through the top atomic layer before leaving the sample , explaining the high relative background intensity that is observed in the photoemission data of all sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 films studied .",
    "oscillations of the intensity of the [ 10 ] diffraction rod ( rheed oscillations ) at the start of film growth .",

    "( b ) stable oscillations for a film grown on ( 110 ) gdsco@xmath5 .",
    "diagrams at right illustrate individual atomic layers for a two unit cell thick film , with arrows representing the growth direction . ]    recently , ref",
    ".   predicted that ultrathin films of polar srcuo@xmath4 grown on nonpolar srtio@xmath5 substrates would exhibit a thickness - controlled transition from a chain - type structure for @xmath69 unit cells to the infinite - layer structure for @xmath70 unit cells .",
    "[ figure9 ] shows , we observe evidence for such a transition in rheed oscillations during the growth of the first few unit cells of srcuo@xmath4 on ( 001 ) srtio@xmath5 .",
    "the first four unit cells consistently show a different pattern of oscillations , and only after deposition of the fourth unit cell do the typical oscillations begin .",
    "interestingly , when films are grown on polar ( 110 ) gdsco@xmath5 substrates , this behavior is suppressed and the first four deposition periods show oscillations qualitatively similar to those at later times . this atomic reconstruction , occurring during the formation of the first few unit cells of srcuo@xmath4 , is likely related to electrostatic instabilities of both the film and the substrate .",
    "this may explain why film growth on a polar substrate such as gdsco@xmath5 results in qualitatively different rheed oscillations even during deposition of the first atomic layers .",
    "in conclusion , we have used _ in situ _ arpes in conjunction with molecular - beam epitaxy to study the doping evolution of thin films of the infinite - layer electron doped cuprate sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 . at low doping ,",
    "a dispersive lhb characteristic of cuprate parent compounds is observed . with the addition of electron carriers , a transition from charge - transfer insulator to metallic superconductor is observed as spectral weight , first appearing at @xmath37 , gradually fills in the charge - transfer gap .",
    "most notably , we observe the coexistence of a remnant lhb with the coherent low - energy states , even for @xmath18 . electron diffraction was used to study the @xmath54 polar surface reconstruction observed in low - doped films .",
    "this reconstruction can be explained with a simple model by considering the polar nature of sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 . finally , we have presented evidence supporting the theoretical prediction of a thickness - controlled transition in ultrathin films of sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 grown on nonpolar substrates .",
    "our work shows that strong local correlations , forming a remnant lhb , remain important in the cuprates even at high electron - doping levels .",
    "furthermore , it appears that in films of sr@xmath0la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 in the ionic limit at low doping , a polar catastrophe is avoided via a structural rather than an electronic reconstruction .",
