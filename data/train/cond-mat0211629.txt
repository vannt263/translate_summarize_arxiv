    "the kondo - lattice model ( klm)@xcite is surely one of the most intensively discussed models in solid state theory .",

    "the latter give rise to permanent magnetic moments which are described as quantum mechanical spins .",
    "characteristic model properties result from an interband exchange , which is written as an intra - atomic interaction of strength @xmath1 between the conduction electron spin @xmath2@xmath3 and local - moment spin @xmath4 :    @xmath5    the index @xmath6 refers to the lattice site @xmath7 . according to the sign of the exchange coupling @xmath1 , a parallel ( @xmath1@xmath80 ) or an antiparallel ( @xmath1@xmath90 ) alignment of itinerant and localized spin is favoured with remarkable differences in the physical properties .",

    "the importance of such effects can impressively be demonstrated by the exactly solvable limiting case of a single electron in an otherwise empty conduction band , interacting with a ferromagnetically saturated spin system @xcite recently we proposed a dmft - based approach to the klm with quantum spins using a fermionization of the local spin operators ( @xmath16=1/2 ) . even for rather moderate exchange coupling",

    "the second point concerns the polaron band , which for less than half - fillings is never occupied ( fig .",
    "[ qdos_nscan_t10 ] ) .",
    "the chemical potential is always in the lowest subband reaching its upper edge for @xmath19@xmath171 . at the same moment the polaron band disappears . the chemical potential jumps into the uppermost subband for more than half - fillings guaranteeing therewith particle - hole symmetry .",

    "in such a case the local spin defines the quantization axis .",
    "when we speak of _ up spin band _ or _ down spin band _ we refer the electron spin to an external axis .",
    "however , in the strong coupling regime the relative orientation of the electron spin in the local frame is decisive for the excitation energies .",
    "the lowest subands , up - spin as well as down - spin , consists of states where the excited electron enters directly or after magnon emission ( absorption ) the local frame parallel to the local spin .",
    "if it arrives at the local frame antiparallel to the local spin then it goes into the second low - energy subband centered at @xmath125(@xmath16 + 1 ) .",
    "there is a slight probability that the electron is not trapped by the localized spin but rather propagating with high mobility through the spin lattice .",
    "then the total magnetization @xmath66 will become decisive as effective quantization axis , leading to a mean - field type behaviour of the quasiparticle according to the first term in the self - energy  ( [ eq : sigmaansatz1 ] ) .",

    "the positions of the bands are hardly affected by temperature as one might expect because of the first term in the self - energy  ( [ eq : sigmaansatz1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmaansatz2 ] ) , respectively . for strong exchange couplings the second term , which incorporates all the spinflip processes , dominates .",
    "as explained just before , the local frame is decisive being of course unaffected by temperature .",

    "there is a remarkable @xmath31-dependent shift of spectral weight . for a @xmath31-vector from the bottom or from the top of the respective quasiparticle subband",
    "the magnetic polaron is rather stable , while experiencing substantial damping in between . in systems with stronger exchange couplings ( @xmath1=0.4",
    "ev ) the polaron peak , negligibly damped and hardly dispersive , splits off the scattering part .",
    "it contributes to a very narrow quasiparticle subband ( see fig .",
    "[ qdos_jscan_tc ] ) .",
    "and three values of @xmath31 along the ( @xmath128)-direction .",
    "parameters : @xmath129 ev , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 k.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    by use of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : n_sigma ] ) and ( [ eq : delta_sigma ] ) we can eventually evaluate the average spin - dependent particle density @xmath97 and the mixed correlation @xmath98 , and therewith the conduction band polarization , @xmath130 and the spin scalar product which appears in the exchange hamiltonian ( [ eq : hsf ] ) : @xmath131 a typical example ( @xmath1=1  ev , @xmath19=0.5 ) is plotted in fig .  [ corr_functions ] . we recognize that even for strong couplings the electron spin polarization is far from being complete .",
    "no more than 70% polarization are observed .",
    "this again strongly contradicts other treatments of the klm.@xcite the higher correlation functions @xmath132 and @xmath133 exhibit a distinct temperature - dependence , while the sum of both makes the spin - spin scalar product  ( [ eq : spin_scalar ] ) almost temperature - independent .",
    "we have presented an interpolating self - energy approach to the many - body problem of the _ correlated kondo - lattice model _ which interpolates between a maximum number of rigorous statements and exact limiting cases of the ( in general ) not exactly solvable model .",
    "correlations between the band electrons are accounted for by an on - site coulomb interaction of hubbard type . in this paper",
    "we were not interested in the investigation of how the band electron correlations effect the magnetic stability within the klm , as was done , for instance , in ref .  .",
    "a corresponding study of the ( self - consistent ) magnetic part is currently being done and will be presented at a later stage . here",
    "the mentioned correlations simply help to avoid unphysical double occupancies of lattice sites as energetically favored excitations and to separate respective quasiparticle subbands .    in our theory",
    "the strongly exchange coupled system is accounted for by the exact zero - bandwidth limit for all temperatures and band occupations .",
    "the weakly coupled system is addressed by second order perturbation theory ( projection - operator technique ) for all temperatures and bandwidths . for further interpolation between the limits we used the exact but non - trivial results for the special case of a single electron ( hole ) in an otherwise empty ( fully occupied ) band interacting with a ferromagnetically saturated spin system .",
    "this special case exhibits practically all typical elementary processes that determine the physics of the cklm .",
    "it holds for all coupling strengths and bandwidths .",
    "finally we guaranteed the correctness of spectral moments via fitting free parameters in the self - energy ansatz .",
    "the energy spectra show strong dependencies on temperature and band occupation , particularly in the strongly exchange coupled regime which is thought to be relevant for the _ colossal magnetoresistance materials _ as well as for manganese - doped gaas ( _ spintronics _ ) . in our opinion",
    "the results clearly demonstrate the importance to retain the quantum nature of the localized spins . to replace them , for technical reasons , by classical spins",
    "appears to be inadequate .",
    "it must be considered as a shortcoming of the approach that the local moment magnetization had to come into play only as an external parameter , which can give rise to certain inconsistencies .",
    "it is planned for the future to incorporate the local moment system into the self - consistency circle .",
    "this work was prepared as an india - germany partnership program sponsored by the volkswagen foundation .",
    "financial support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft within the sonderforschungsbereich 290 is also gratefully acknowledged as well as support by the friedrich - naumann foundation for one of us ( j.k . ) ."
