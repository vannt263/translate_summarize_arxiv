    "einstein s model for brownian motion suggests that the particle under scrutiny moves ballistically between collisions with the molecules of the surrounding medium . as the medium becomes more rarified , the free path of the particle increases until the particle becomes ballistic on a macroscopic scale .",
    "superfluid helium at low temperatures behaves as a vacuum that supports a gas of phonons whose density changes with temperature as @xmath3 .",
    "if one uses a brownian particle , whose size is much smaller than the wavelength of phonons @xmath4 , the particle will experience rayleigh scattering with the cross - section @xmath5 .",
    "overall , the free path of such brownian particle @xmath6 would scale as @xmath7 , and its behaviour could be scanned through many orders of magnitude of @xmath6 in a narrow temperature range .",
    "this would allow the regime between ballistic motion and diffusion to be studied .",
    "one candidate for such a brownian particle is the helium excimer molecule he@xmath8 in the triplet ( @xmath9 ) state , which in liquid helium forms a cavity ( `` bubble '' ) with a diameter@xcite of @xmath10=1.3 nm .",
    "this is much smaller than the bubbles of 4 nm in diameter formed around free electrons in helium , and much smaller than the average wavelength of phonons ( @xmath1160 nm at @xmath12200mk ) .",
    "the molecules form as a result of recombination of positive and negative ions@xcite .",
    "they were shown to be entrained by the moving normal component in superfluid helium at high temperatures@xcite .",
    "their relatively long half - life@xcite of ( 13@xmath132)s in superfluid is attributed to the forbidden transition to a lower energy state , which requires a spin flip@xcite .",
    "the experimental cell of 0.6litres in volume was filled with ultrapure @xmath1he ( concentration of @xmath14he was@xcite @xmath15 ) and cooled down with a dilution refrigerator .",
    "the sketch of the experimental setup is presented in fig .",
    "the molecules were generated using field emission from a tungsten tip@xcite into superfluid helium .",
    "only moderate electric currents of up to @xmath22na and short pulses of 50ms were used to suppress the formation of turbulent tangles in the superfluid .",
    "the corresponding negative tip voltages were up to @xmath16v .",
    "two grounded grids in front of the tip were used to collect electrons .",
    "the molecules travelled a distance of @xmath17 cm through the superfluid helium , and their arrival was registered at a detector comprising a copper plate and a stainless steel grid separated by thin ( 50@xmath18 m ) kapton strips . a voltage of @xmath19=-1.2kv was applied to the grid , so that the detector electric field was @xmath20v / cm .",
    "when the molecules collide with a metal surface , they are ionized or knock an electron out of the metal and the electric field separates the opposite charges or the electron from its image . the collected electron",
    "current was amplified at room temperature using a sr570 current preamplifier .",
    "the measured time constant of the preamplifier was 5.5ms , so the setup was capable of resolving average velocities of up to 10 m/s .",
    "the experiments were carried out at two pressures in the cell : @xmath210.1bar and @xmath215.0bar .",
    "examples of the obtained signals at low temperatures are presented in fig .",
    "[ fast ] . for unknown reasons the amplitude of the signals at 5.0bar was significantly smaller for a similar tip current .",
    "the time of flight was found to be independent of the amplitude of the tip current , and translated into average velocities of 1.7 m/s and 2.4 m/s for the pressures of 0.1 and 5.0bar correspondingly .",
    "the time of flight here is defined as the time at the maximum of the peak minus the halfwidth of the injection pulse ( 25ms ) and minus the time constant of the preamplifier ( 5.5ms ) .",
    "signals at higher temperatures are shown in fig .",
    "the fast peak on both signals is probably due to photons emitted by atoms in short - lived excited states , which could lead to photocurrent .",
    "the amplitude of the signals and the time of flight did not change up to temperatures of 110 and 150mk for signals at 0.1bar and 5.0bar respectively . above those temperatures the amplitude started to decrease and the time of flight and the linewidth , defined as the signal width at half the maximum ,",
    "this is illustrated in more detail in figs .",
    "[ tof ]  and  [ ampl ] for the data obtained at @xmath22bar .",
    "similar dependences were observed at @xmath215.0bar .",
    "in order to obtain the diffusion coefficient , we recourse to the calculation of mobility of an electron bubble in superfluid @xmath1he performed by baym et al.@xcite .",
    "as the radius of the excimer bubble is much smaller than that of the electron bubble , we can neglect the resonant scattering , which is important for phonons of wavelength comparable to the size of the bubble , and also neglect the compressibility of the bubble .",
    "the analogue of mobility for neutral particles is the factor of proportionality between the drift velocity and the force exerted on the excimer :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the speed of sound in helium and @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "formula  ( [ bb ] ) coincides with the result of baym et al.@xcite in the limit @xmath26 .",
    "the momentum relaxation time @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the effective mass of an excimer .",
    "it equals the sum of the hydrodynamic mass of the bubble and the mass of two @xmath1he atoms : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the liquid density .",
    "the momentum relaxation distance is of order @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the characteristic velocity of an excimer .",
    "the excimers can not be treated as ballistic particles when @xmath6 becomes comparable to the size of the cell @xmath345.5 cm .",
    "this gives the characteristic temperatures for the onset of the crossover regime as @xmath35mk and @xmath36mk for @xmath22bar and 5.0bar correspondingly .",
    "similar temperatures were observed in the experiment .    the diffusion coefficient is given by @xmath37 , so that the mean diffusion time over the distance @xmath38 is equal to    @xmath39    this time is calculated without any fitting parameters and compared to the measured time of flight in fig .",
    "[ diff ] ( dashed line ) .",
    "the diffusion regime at @xmath215.0bar failed to develop in full before the signal disappeared , but the temperature dependences for both pressures in the intermediate regime are consistent with the @xmath40 power law .",
    "we do not have a suitable theory on hand and this fact is yet to be explained .",
    "an interesting fact is that the measured average velocities of the molecules in the ballistic regime were smaller than their calculated thermal velocities @xmath41 . at @xmath42mk",
    "the mean thermal velocities of excimers are 4.4 m/s ( 4.3 m/s ) for @xmath43=0.1bar ( 5.0bar ) , while in the experiment mean velocities of the excimers at low temperatures were 1.7 m/s ( 2.4 m/s ) for @xmath43=0.1bar ( 5.0bar ) .",
    "perhaps the excimers do not have time to thermalise after they have been formed ( at low temperatures @xmath44 ) : the most probable mechanism for the creation of molecules is recombination of positive ions and electrons , so that the resulting momentum is the sum of the momenta of the components ( which , in turn , were not necessarily thermalised ) .    in our treatment we did not take into account scattering from @xmath14he atoms . in the ballistic regime ,",
    "the collisions become important when @xmath45 is on the order of 1 atom per volume covered by an excimer trajectory @xmath46 , or @xmath47 . as",
    "phonon scattering intensifies , the trajectories of excimers become more complicated and the probability of collisions increases .",
    "it seems plausible that the excimer molecules cease to exist upon meeting a @xmath14he atom .",
    "indeed , the @xmath14he atom has a nuclear spin , which provides an interaction that might facilitate the electron spin flip required for the excimer to dissociate .",
    "also , @xmath14he atoms tend to condense on the surfaces of the bubbles , as they decrease the surface tension@xcite . in the case of the electron bubble ,",
    "the condensation energy@xcite is 0.25k per atom and is probably not very different for the excimer bubble . in our situation",
    "this means that the excimers , which had interacted with @xmath14he atoms , did not contribute to the observed signal and interaction with @xmath14he impurities can be safely ignored as far as the time of flight is concerned .",
    "the same argument applies to excimer - excimer collisions .",
    "the annihilation of excimers by @xmath14he impurities is consistent with the observed significant decrease in the excimer signal upon introducing @xmath48 of @xmath14he impurities .",
    "on the other hand , excimers were observed in @xmath1he with the concentration of @xmath14he on the order of @xmath49 at temperatures above 1k@xcite .",
    "this could be due to @xmath14he impurities not condensing on the bubble surfaces at high temperatures : condensed @xmath14he atoms spend longer times and are closer to the excited electron , which makes the spin - spin interaction more effective , and excimers more sensitive to @xmath14he impurities at low temperatures .",
    "we have observed three different kinds of transport of excimer molecules in superfluid @xmath1he : ballistic at low temperatures , diffusion at high temperatures ( where the time of flight is proportional to @xmath50 ) , and crossover between the two regimes at intermediate temperatures .",
    "we used a primitive analysis to calculate the diffusion coefficient and see a satisfactory agreement with the experiment .",
    "the calculated values for the temperature of crossover onset are consistent with measurements at both experimental pressures @xmath210.1bar and @xmath215.0bar .",
    "the time of flight of excimers in the crossover region was found to be proportional to @xmath40 , for which we do not yet have an explanation .",
