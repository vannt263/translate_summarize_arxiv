    "hard x - ray emission has long been used as the prime diagnostic tool to study particle acceleration and energy release in solar flares . from these x - ray observations",
    "the mean electron flux spectrum ( e.g. averaged over the x - ray emitting volume , see @xcite for details ) can be determined either through forward fitting @xcite or more advanced inversion techniques @xcite . at higher energies , typically above 10 - 20  kev , the observed hard x - ray spectrum is considered to be due to an accelerated population of electrons being stopped by the dense chromosphere via coulomb collisions @xcite .",
    "the spectrum below 10 - 20  kev normally originates from thermal coronal sources with temperatures of 10s mk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the reuven ramaty high energy solar spectrometer ( rhessi ) provides high resolution hxr spectra of solar flares @xcite , greatly improving on previous measurements @xcite .",
    "this high energy resolution spectra has allowed , for the first time , to scrutinize the x - ray and electron spectra in search for a non - powerlaw features , revealing vital clues about electron acceleration and transport . in some rhessi flares , the recovered mean electron flux spectrum demonstrates a local minima or _ dip _ between the non - thermal and the thermal components instead of a smooth transition @xcite .",
    "the presence of the dip , as a real physical feature of the electron spectra , has been questioned as in many cases it can be attributed to photospheric albedo , e.g. compton back - scattered x - rays @xcite . however a few events have been found in which after isotropic albedo correction @xcite , the x - ray spectrum is still relatively flat , so they could be fitted with a thick - target model single power - law spectrum with a low energy cutoff @xcite . in these flares a dip was not directly observed in the mean electron spectrum , but instead inferred from forward fitting a model with low energy cutoff to the x - ray spectrum .",
    "this model has a thermal component at low energies and at higher energies purely collisional thick - target model of a single power - law of accelerated electrons above a cutoff . in this thick - target scenario @xcite ,",
    "the dip in the mean electron spectrum originates from a positive slope at low energies developing below the cutoff as the accelerated electrons propagate from a coronal acceleration site downwards to the chromosphere , having coulomb collisions with the background plasma .",
    "if the dip is real it provides important insights into flare energetics since the energy in accelerated electrons is strongly dependent on the low energy cutoff .",
    "for any reasonable x - ray producing flare , non - collisional beam - plasma interaction is much faster than that via coulomb collisions @xcite .",
    "such processes are inferred to occur in downward propagating electron beams from radio observations of reverse slope drift burst in flares .",
    "although generation and escape of electromagnetic radiation from langmuir waves in a flaring plasma is not well understood .",
    "the role of wave - particle interactions in solar flares assuming stationary , time - independent injection of electrons have been considered analytically and numerically @xcite . @xcite",
    "have argued that the conditionally created distribution should be constantly being flattened by quasi - linear relaxation , while @xcite and @xcite suggest that although the wave - particle interactions have an important effect , the change of the electron spectra under stationary conditions should be minor .",
    "however , in a more realistic flare conditions the injection ( acceleration ) of electrons is likely to be highly intermittent @xcite with a number of short duration pulses is often observed @xcite , so the time - dependent solution of particle transport equations accounting for wave - particle interactions should be considered . additionally , the previous studies did not consider the spatial and temporal evolution of the beam from the coronal source down into chromosphere - a crucial aspect when considering the propagation of an electron beam in comparison to x - ray observations .",
    "+    the quasi - linear relaxation process of langmuir waves has been considered in higher velocity dimensions ( other than the parallel component considered here ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) but it has only been recently that the 2d system has been fully numerically solved @xcite .",
    "even then the evolution was considered in a spatially independent manner . in these studies",
    "it was found that the parallel component ( 1d ) is the fastest processes and likely to dominate the electron transport .    in this letter",
    "we take a step towards a more complete treatment of electron transport in solar flares by including the spatial evolution of beam - driven langmuir wave turbulence .",
    "we numerically study the system self - consistently , simulating the propagation of an electron beam from the coronal acceleration site down to the chromosphere , considering the truncated power - law spectrum frequently used for data interpretation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to investigate the evolution of the mean electron flux spectrum below this cutoff .",
    "we demonstrate that the positive slope of the mean electron flux is not present , when the response of the background plasma via langmuir waves to the propagating electron beam is taken into account .",
    "we also show that the injected electron spectrum flattens to a decreasing distribution due to collective interaction with plasma even for weak flares ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , we suggest that a flat spectrum ( with spectral index 0 to 1 ) down to thermal energies maybe a better approximation as opposed to the sharp cut - off in the injected electron spectrum .",
    "following the standard model approach for interpreting solar flare hard x - ray spectra , we assume the electron flux spectrum of injected ( flare accelerated ) electrons is a power law , @xmath0 , [ electrons @xmath1 s@xmath2 kev@xmath2 ] down to some energy @xmath4 , typically 10 - 20 kev . the initial 1d electron distribution function ( accelerated electron population ) subsequently is also a power - law in velocity @xmath5 , above a low energy cutoff @xmath6 with spectral index @xmath7 . for our simulations",
    "we consider such an initial electron distribution which is also spatially a gaussian of characteristic size @xmath8    @xmath9    normalised by the beam density @xmath10 .",
    "+    to self - consistently follow the temporal and spatial evolution of an electron beam from a coronal acceleration site , including the response of the thermal background plasma in the form of langmuir waves , we use the 1d equations of quasi - linear relaxation @xcite    @xmath11    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the electron distribution function [ electrons @xmath14 s ] , @xmath15 is the spectral energy density [ erg @xmath1 ] , @xmath17 is the wave number of a langmuir wave , @xmath18 is the background plasma density and @xmath19 is the local plasma frequency .",
    "the first component on the righthand side of equations ( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : w ] ) are the quasilinear terms that describes the resonant interaction between the electrons and langmuir waves , @xmath20 .",
    "also included are the coulomb collision dampening rate for both the electrons @xmath21 @xcite and waves @xmath22 @xcite . where @xmath23 is the coulomb logarithm",
    ", @xmath24 is the temperature of the background plasma and @xmath25 is the velocity of a thermal electron , @xmath26 is the boltzmann constant . also included in equation ( [ eq : w ] )",
    "is the landau dampening rate @xmath27 @xcite and the spontaneous emission @xmath28 @xcite .    in the simulations , we take @xmath29 , or @xmath30 from a cutoff of @xmath31 cm s@xmath2 , or @xmath32 kev , up to maximum of @xmath33 cm s@xmath2 .",
    "our simulation extends in velocity space from @xmath34 cm s@xmath2 ( taking @xmath35mk ) to @xmath36 cm s@xmath2 .",
    "the initial spatial scale of the beam is @xmath37  cm with density of @xmath38 cm @xmath39 .",
    "the initial number of electrons in this simulation is @xmath40 electrons , which is an approximation as we only have one spatial dimension to estimate the volume from , taking this as the @xmath41 , which is typically measured is x - ray imaging observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we have used a modest number of electrons , similar to that found in a small flare , or microflare , a typical a or b - class goes flare .",
    "since the rate of wave - particle interactions is proportional to electron beam density , the effects of wave - particle interaction will be present to a far greater extent in larger flares .",
    "we approximate the background plasma density @xmath18 assuming a constant of @xmath42cm@xmath39 at coronal heights , with a sharp density increase at the chromosphere level , with further steady hydrostatic increase towards the photosphere @xcite , see figure [ fig : density ] the initial electron beam is spatially centred at @xmath44  cm , see figures [ fig : fb ] and [ fig : fbw ] for details .",
    "+    the equations ( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : w ] ) are solved numerically using a finite difference method as described by @xcite .",
    "this is over a grid of 60 points in velocity space and 160 in position space .",
    "the fastest process here is the quasilinear relaxation , occurring on a timescale of @xmath45 seconds .",
    "therefore we numerically solve equations ( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : w ] ) using a time - step at least an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "the initial spectral energy density is taken to be the thermal background which has reached a steady - state through coulomb collisions and wave - particle emission / absorption .",
    "these simulations are ran for 1 second in simulation time , enough time for all of the electrons to reach the highest density region , lose energy and then leave the simulation grid , joining the thermal electrons .",
    "+   +      we start by simulating the propagation of the electron beam in the absence of waves , with only coulomb collisions acting on the electrons , following the standard thick - target model @xcite .",
    "namely , only solving equation ( [ eq : f ] ) and ignoring the first term on the righthand side , the wave - particle interactions .",
    "the resulting electron distribution @xmath46 for various times during the simulation is shown in figure [ fig : fb ] .",
    "the electrons with the highest velocities move quickly to lower heights where they encounter the sharply increasing background plasma density ( chromosphere ) below about 3 mm . here",
    "the coulomb collisions quickly cause the electrons to lose energy and eventually have velocities outside of the simulation grid . at lower energies",
    "the sharp initial low energy cutoff is smoothed out through coulomb collisions reducing the electrons velocity .",
    "the time averaged mean electron flux spectrum of purely collisional transport is shown in figure [ fig : nfv ] .",
    "this spatially integrated mean electron flux spectrum @xmath47 or @xmath48 is related to the simulated electron distribution @xmath13 as @xmath49 dx $ ] where @xmath50 is the cross - sectional area of the beam .",
    "we take this to be @xmath51 given our 1d simulation .",
    "the positive slope at low energies is clearly visible with the expected decreasing power - law above roughly the original low energy cutoff ( figure [ fig : nfv ] left ) .",
    "overplotted is an example model thermal spectrum to demonstrate how the local minima ( dip ) appears in the spectrum .",
    "a typical flare temperature of 10 mk is used , with a modest emission measure of @xmath52 cm@xmath39 to match the observations of the small flare we have simulated .",
    "this is a standard thick - target spectrum , which is used to fit and interpret x - ray spectrum .",
    "we now follow the beam propagating with langmuir waves generated by the background plasma in response to the beam , numerically solving both equations ( [ eq : f ] ) and ( [ eq : w ] ) .",
    "the resulting electron and spectral wave density distributions are shown in figure [ fig : fbw ] as a function of @xmath53 and @xmath54 for various times during the simulation .",
    "the electron distribution function @xmath13 quickly flattens to form a plateau - like distribution expected for beam - plasma interaction via plasma waves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the electrons together with the waves move down and eventually end up in the dense regions of the atmosphere , where the transport becomes dominated by collisions .",
    "the motion of the plasma turbulence ( figure [ fig : fbw ] ) is not due to the group motion of waves , which is negligibly small @xmath55 , but appears because the langmuir waves are locally generated and efficiently reabsorbed by the beam itself or collisionally by the surrounding plasma .",
    "the wave - particle interactions clearly changes the overall shape of spatially integrated electron flux spectrum , as shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : nfv ] .",
    "crucially , no positive slope is created in the non - thermal spectrum below the initial low energy cutoff , resulting in no dip in the overall model spectrum .",
    "this can be further seen when we consider the spectral index @xmath56 of the mean electron flux spectrum as a function of energy in figure [ fig : deriv ] . where as the beam only simulation produces a brief energy range where @xmath57 , it is always positive in the beam and wave case .",
    "the slightly reduced level of the mean electron flux spectrum also suggests that the generation of langmuir waves leads to additional energy losses by the beam ( into heating the background plasma ) and higher number of energetic electrons will be required to explain the same x - ray spectra .    the spectral index @xmath58 of the mean electron spectrum for the simulation with the electron beam only subject to coulomb collisions ( black line ) and with the beam - driven langmuir waves ( blue line ) .",
    "the dashed line indicates the total model spectra ( including thermal component ) demonstrating a local minima in the beam only case.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "considering both the temporal and spatial evolution , the mean electron flux spectrum is very sensitive to the generation of waves .",
    "the influence of wave - particle interactions is seen to flatten the spectral index of the electron spectrum @xmath59 below the break but also up to where the beam - plasma interaction time is faster than the electron cloud time size .",
    "the artificially introduced low - energy cutoff in the injected electron spectrum disappears not only in the local electrons distribution function but also in the spatially integrated electron spectrum once wave - particle interactions is taken into account .",
    "the character of beam propagation is close to the simulation results of beam transport along open field lines , where collisions are normally ignored @xcite .",
    "however , there are noticeable differences . in the simplistic treatment of spatially uniform beam , when all but quasilinear terms are ignored ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the generation of waves leads to an exact plateau distribution with @xmath60 .",
    "our simulations show that the spectral index , @xmath61 is more than zero , which is the result of collisions .",
    "similarly , @xcite show that the spatially integrated spectrum of particles will not deviate from a initial power - law , but only when processes leading to absorption of waves or removal of waves out of resonance are included .",
    "the simulations in this letter are for typical microflare parameters @xcite and given that the wave emission scales with the electron number density we would expect wave - particle interactions to have more significant , effect in large flares .",
    "large flares could constitute multiple intermittent bursts of accelerated electrons directed along possibly different magnetic field lines .",
    "the fast time variations in hard x - ray lightcurves @xcite indirectly support this idea .",
    "numerical simulations of reconnection suggest `` bursty '' electron acceleration @xcite and spatially fragmented electron acceleration @xcite which could result in electron propagation along the different lines .",
    "the footpoint motion often seen in solar flares @xcite also suggest that the electrons are consecutively injected onto field lines . in this scenario",
    "an ensemble of our simulations , multiple micro - beam injections , would lead to beam densities comparable to a large flare .",
    "the convergence of the magnetic field at chromospheric heights has been ignored in this work , however in our simulations the overall evolution of the energetic particles in the top part of a relatively dense loop , @xmath42  cm@xmath39 , is dominated by wave - particle interactions where the field is not converging .",
    "it is only in the denser chromosphere , where the field is likely to converge , that the collisions become dominant .",
    "the very fast flattening of the powerlaw distribution s low energy cutoff by the wave - particle interactions suggests that it is unlikely that such a cutoff could develop and is therefore an unwise initial distribution for any model of coronally accelerated electrons .",
    "the non - thermal distribution flattening at low energies as it transitions into the thermal distribution seems to be a realistic model .",
    "given how strongly the total energy in the accelerated elections depends on a cutoff , or its behaviour at low energies approaching the thermal distribution , this transition needs further study .",
    "the work presented here is a step towards a more complete treatment of electron transport in solar flares , moving from the standard thick target model ( 1d velocity with collisions only ) to beam - driven langmuir turbulence ( 1d velocity , 1d space , collisions and wave - particle interactions ) . in future work we need to extend this to consider 2 or higher dimensions of velocity space , the changing magnetic field , electron scattering as well as the transition between the accelerated beam and thermal distribution .    we would like to thank the referee for their constructive comments .",
