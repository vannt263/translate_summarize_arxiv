    "the magellanic clouds are a pair of satellite galaxies which are gravitationally bound to our own but which have structural and chemical characteristics differing significantly from each other , and from the milky way .",
    "these differences are likely to be reflected in the properties of different stellar populations .",
    "the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) is located at a distance of about 60 kpc ( harries , hilditch , & howarth 2003 ) and centred on a position of r.a .",
    "it is therefore close enough to be observed with modest ground based telescopes whilst at the same time providing an opportunity to study and compare the evolution of other galaxies .",
    "intensive x - ray satellite observations have revealed that the smc contains an unexpectedly large number of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ) . at the time of writing ,",
    "47 known or probable sources of this type have been identified in the smc and they continue to be discovered , although only a small fraction of these are active at any one time because of their transient nature .",
    "all x - ray binaries so far discovered in the smc are hmxbs ( coe et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "most high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) belong to the be class , in which a neutron star orbits an ob star surrounded by a circumstellar disk of variable size and density .",
    "the optical companion stars are early - type o - b class stars of luminosity class iii - v , typically of 10 to 20 solar masses that at some time have shown emission in the balmer series lines . the systems as a whole exhibit significant excess flux at long ( ir and radio ) wavelengths , referred to as the infrared excess .",
    "these characteristic signatures as well as strong h@xmath4 line emission are attributed to the presence of circumstellar material in a disk - like configuration ( coe 2000 , okazaki & negueruela 2001 ) .    the mechanisms which give rise to the disk are not well understood ,",
    "although fast rotation is likely to be an important factor , and it is possible that non - radial pulsation and magnetic loops may also play a part .",
    "short - term periodic variability is observed in the earlier type be stars .",
    "the disk is thought to consist of relatively cool material , which interacts periodically with a compact object in an eccentric orbit , leading to regular x - ray outbursts .",
    "it is also possible that the be star undergoes a sudden ejection of matter ( negueruela 1998 , porter & rivinius 2003 ) .",
    "be / x - ray binaries can present differing states of x - ray activity varying from persistent low or non - detectable luminosities to short outbursts . systems with wide orbits will tend to accrete from less dense regions of the disk and hence show relatively small outbursts .",
    "these are referred to as type i ( stella et al .",
    ", 1986 ) and usually coincide with the periastron of the neutron star .",
    "systems with smaller orbits are more likely to accrete from dense regions over a range of orbital phases and give rise to very high luminosity outbursts , although these may be modulated by the presence of a density wave in the disk . prolonged major outbursts , which are not confined to periastron passage , are normally called type ii ( negueruela 1998 ) .",
    "this x - ray object was discovered in archive data using an observation made by the chandra x - ray observatory on 4 july 2002 ( mjd 52459 ) ( edge et al . 2004 ) .",

    "sxp504 has been identified as an x - ray binary pulsar system in the smc ( edge et al .",
    "it appears to be typical of such systems insofar as the optical counterpart is a be star , but it is unusual because it is one of a minority of such objects that show visible peaks in the optical lightcurves at the binary period . the most comparable system in the smc is sxp756 which also has a long orbital period at 394 days as well as highly visible , but narrow and short lived , optical outbursts .",
    "the optical modulation is thought to arise when the neutron star in a highly eccentric orbit briefly interacts with be star disk at periastron . the tidal torque , which is strongest at this point , removes angular momentum from the outermost part of the disk , causing it to shrink and its density to increase . in addition",
    ", the two - armed spiral wave , which is excited at periastron , also enhances the disk density .",
    "if the disk is optically thin , the luminosity will also increase because the local emissivity is proportional to the square of the density .",
    "this occurs just after the periastron passage of the neutron star ( okazaki et al .",
    "the higher the orbital eccentricity , the more rapid and significant the luminosity increase is expected to be ( okazaki 2005 , in preparation ) .",
    "the subsequent decay of the optical outburst results from expansion of the disk by viscous diffusion and is necessarily slower .",
    "it follows that where the binary orbit is long and highly eccentric , the disk is almost unaffected for much of the orbital phase and the optical outbursts are likely to be more clearly marked .    the 268 day period detected in this system is visible as outburst peaks in both the ogle and macho lightcurves . the existence of these peaks has been confirmed by folding the data and revealing the pulse profiles .",
    "lomb - scargle analysis of the macho and ogle data has detected a period of @xmath21 days , which agrees closely with the observed period of the outburst intervals .",
    "all these observations can be described by an ephemeris of :    @xmath22    where t is the epoch of the outburst and n is the outburst cycle number .",
    "lomb - scargle analysis of the consolidated rxte observations has detected a period of @xmath10 days .",
    "furthermore the stronger x - ray detections of @xmath9 are nearly all very close to the peaks predicted by the optical ephemeris , but because of non - continuous x - ray coverage , others may well have been missed .",
    "the relationship between this orbital period and the pulse period of 504s is within the normal variance found in the corbet diagram ( corbet 1984 ) .",
    "these results , taken together , confirm that 268 days is the binary period of the system .",
    "they also provide an instructive example of the use of parallel and complementary long term x - ray and optical data in determining the orbital characteristics of an x - ray binary system .",
