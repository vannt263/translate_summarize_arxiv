    "in nuclear theory , the random - phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite has proven a valuable tool in the description of collective nuclear vibrations , foremost giant resonances . in its self - consistent version",
    ", it facilitates connections between the properties of such vibrations and the equation of state of nuclear matter .",
    "the self - consistent rpa for closed - shell nuclei is understood here as the formulation of rpa whereby the reference state is the solution of the hartree - fock ( hf ) equations for a given nuclear interaction or density functional , while the rpa residual interaction is derived from the same interaction or functional .",
    "we may denote this method by  hf - rpa \" .",
    "it can be argued that hf - rpa is not a self - consistent many - body method , in the sense that the hf solution differs from the correlated rpa ground state .",
    "as long as we are interested in ( long - range ) density fluctuations , however , and the hf ground state describes well the long - range spatial properties of nuclei , e.g. , the root mean square radius , the use of a correlated ground state in first - order rpa makes only a marginal difference  @xcite .",
    "this outcome validates the equations - of - motion philosophy  @xcite of working with low - rank ( in the many - body sense ) operators .",
    "the latter are obtained as ( double ) commutators of higher - rank operators and the sensitivity of their matrix elements to correlations in the ground state is reduced by comparison .",
    "hf - rpa is self - consistent in other important ways , though .",
    "the hf and rpa methods are intimately connected  @xcite : the hf equations , which constitute a variational problem , are equivalent to the stability condition of rpa  @xcite . if hf - rpa has imaginary solutions , these must signify a phase transition .",
    "for example , an imaginary @xmath0 solution to hf - rpa in a spherical basis indicates that the nuclear ground state for the given hamiltonian can not be spherical . in the absence of such instabilities ,",
    "the summed energy - weighted strength of a single - particle transition operator in rpa is determined by a specific expectation value in the hf ground state .",
    "symmetries which are broken by the hf ground state , such as translational invariance in the case of a localized nuclear wave - function , are restored by hf - rpa : spurious  excitations \" such as center - of - mass translations , are guaranteed to appear at zero excitation energy , according to thouless theorem  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the above formal and important properties , the hf - rpa method deserves the attribute  self - consistent \" .    among extensions of rpa to include more complex configurations we find the second ( or second - order ) rpa ( srpa )  @xcite , where the vibration operators are constructed not only with particle - hole ( @xmath1 ) , but also with two - particle - two - hole ( @xmath2 ) configurations .",
    "srpa accommodates collisional damping and has been used to describe the fragmentation width of resonances  @xcite .",
    "applications in metallic clusters exist as well  @xcite .",
    "recent formal progress includes the derivation of rearrangement terms to be taken into account when employing density - dependent forces  @xcite .",
    "early applications in nuclear physics  @xcite were realized in restricted @xmath2 spaces , comprising configurations energetically near the resonances of interest .",
    "the single - particle spectrum was typically that of a woods - saxon potential .",
    "often the ground state included correlations .",
    "ground - state correlations are particularly relevant for the description of gammow - teller and other low - energy resonances .",
    "formalisms going beyond rpa in the spirit of srpa are known as extended - rpa theories and are often formulated on a correlated ground state  @xcite .    in analogy to hf - rpa",
    ", one may speak of a  self - consistent \" hf - srpa , where the ground state is the hf solution .",
    "formal properties analogous to hf - srpa  @xcite have made the method particularly alluring and led to several recent applications  @xcite .",
    "the first fully self - consistent hf - srpa calculations , where all couplings in the hf solutions and the srpa matrix are described by the same hamiltonian , and the full @xmath1 and @xmath2 basis generated by the hf solution is used , were reported in @xcite .",
    "the promise , as it were , of hf - srpa was to provide a self - consistent framework for the description of a variety of nuclear vibrations using realistic , renormalized finite - range potentials , not fitted to hf or rpa results , and therefore not causing double - counting . besides increased computing power and new solution techniques , the calculations were made possible thanks to a two - body , finite - range potential , which does not cause divergencies .",
    "by contrast , applications with zero - range skyrme interactions must use a truncated @xmath2 space ; not only to minimize double counting of higher - order effects ( which is unavoidable ) , but also because there is no natural momentum cutoff .",
    "the above numerical applications  @xcite demostrated the formal properties of hf - srpa for the first time : the precise conservation of the energy - weighted sum rule despite a strong downward energetic shift of the dominant resonances ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; and the generation of self - energy corrections and fragmentation .",
    "unfortunately , they also revealed that the hf - srpa method results in spurious states at genuinely finite energy , and in unstable solutions , which within hf - rpa correspond to real low - energy collective vibrations .",
    "the above are in apparent contrast with the formal derivations of ref .",
    "@xcite , which follow from thouless theorem  @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present article to clarify the situation .",
    "it will be shown , with the help of illuminating numerical examples , that the problems encountered in refs .",
    "@xcite are inherent in the hf - srpa formalism ; that they do not contradict thouless theorem ; and that the contradiction with ref .",
    "@xcite is caused by the violation of the stability condition .",
    "in what follows , by  srpa \" we will mean  hf - srpa \" as a rule ",
    "similarly for rpa .",
    "it is important to first be aware of what has _ not _ been proven about srpa . as a result of not _ proving _ much yet , some arguments in sec .",
    "[ sec : formal ] and sec.[sec : violation ] may appear speculative .",
    "their relevance will become clear through the rest of sec .",
    "[ sec : stability ] , where the stability condition is addressed and thouless theorem derived and interpreted anew , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] , where numerical examples are analyzed .",
    "we provide an outlook in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider the srpa as it was formulated in , e.g. , ref .  @xcite . in brief , excited states @xmath3 of energy @xmath4 with respect to the ground state are considered as combinations of @xmath1 and @xmath2 configurations , @xmath5 the hf ground state is considered as the reference state .",
    "the arrays containing the forward @xmath6 and backward @xmath7 amplitudes are the solutions of the srpa equations in the @xmath8 space , @xmath9 the matrices @xmath10 ( hermitean ) and @xmath11 ( symmetric ) are block matrices in the @xmath8 space , @xmath12 in the above , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the usual rpa matrices in the @xmath1 space , the subscripts  @xmath15 \" or  @xmath16 \" denote the matrices coupling the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 spaces and the subscripts  @xmath17 \" denote matrices in the @xmath2 space . the matrix elements are defined as double commutators of the nuclear hamiltonian @xmath18 with the vibration creation and annihilation operators  @xcite . for two - body hamiltonians ( and a hf reference state ) we have @xmath19 the matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 are of dimension @xmath20 , where @xmath21 in an obvious notation . the usual tamm - dancoff approximations to rpa and srpa ( tda and stda , respectively ) are obtained by setting @xmath22 .",
    "they are hermitean eigenvalue problems of dimension @xmath23 ( first - order ) or @xmath20 ( second - order ) and with real eigenvalues .",
    "the @xmath24 ( s)rpa eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : srpa ] ) can be reduced to a problem of dimension @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the derivations of ref .",
    "@xcite can be used to analyze the properties of the srpa matrix in terms of the @xmath25 submatrices , when those are real ( for complex matrices see ref .",
    "in particular , we note that : i ) if both @xmath25 are positive - definite , all ( s)rpa solutions are real ; ii ) if one of the two matrices @xmath25 has one negative eigenvalue , we should expect a pair of imaginary ( s)rpa eigenvalues ; iii ) if both @xmath25 have one negative eigenvalue , we may expect a negative srpa eigenvalue with positive norm and a positive eigenvalue with negative norm ( a pair of _ antinormal _ solutions , as will be defined below ) .",
    "we may write the srpa problem also as an energy - dependent problem of dimension @xmath26 .",
    "for a two - body hamiltonian the srpa matrix is reduced to @xmath27 with @xmath28 . in the @xmath2 space",
    "we may introduce the representation which diagonalizes @xmath29 .",
    "then we have @xmath30_{ph , p'h ' }   = [ a_{11}]_{ph , p'h ' } + \\sum_{\\alpha}[a_{12}]_{ph,\\alpha } [ a^{\\dagger}_{12}]_{\\alpha , p'h ' } / ( e - e_{\\alpha})\\ ] ] where @xmath31 are the eigenvalues of @xmath29 .",
    "this equation proves useful in demonstrating the generation of srpa instabilities and energetic shifts .",
    "let us begin with rpa and introduce a single @xmath2 configuration of high energy ",
    "higher than most @xmath1 energies .",
    "certain matrix elements of @xmath13 ( including the diagonal ) will acquire energy - dependent contributions . for @xmath32 lower than typical @xmath2 energies , the contributions on the diagonal",
    "will all be negative , meaning that , on average , the eigenvalues of @xmath33 decrease .",
    "more than one @xmath2 configurations will enhance the effect on average , since @xmath2 energies are higher than @xmath1 energies on average .",
    "the above arguments sketch , albeit incompletely , why lower - lying rpa solutions , including spurious states , appear to shift to lower energies when the space is extended to srpa  @xcite .",
    "now suppose we are working with an operator such that , in rpa , @xmath34 is positive semi - definite and @xmath35 is positive - definite ( or vice versa ) .",
    "after introducing @xmath2 configurations , @xmath34 need not retain its positive semi - definitness , but could acquire a negative eigenvalue .    in this connection",
    "we point out that certain matrix elements in the srpa matrix do not affect the hf and rpa problems : in particular , the @xmath36 and @xmath37 matrix elements found in the @xmath38 matrix .",
    "this means that we can include randomly huge matrix elements in the @xmath38 matrix , thus dramatically altering the srpa outcome and even deliberately introducing negative eigenvalues , without ever seeing any effect in hf and rpa . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is proposed to exploit this apparent freedom to better constrain the interaction and moderate the energetic shifting of resonances .",
    "the point remains , that zero - energy spurious solutions and always - positive eigenvalues are not guaranteed in srpa and the reason lies in the formalism itself .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the energy - weighted sum associated with any single - particle excitation operator is the same in rpa and srpa , as long as the same hf reference state and the same @xmath1 space is used .",
    "an important outcome of the present work is to reconcile this well - known result with the appearance of finite - energy spurious states in srpa .",
    "a necessary condition for the hf solution to minimize the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the variational model space consisting of single slater determinants is that the ( first - order ) rpa stability matrix be positive semi - definite  @xcite . satisfying this condition by no means",
    "implies that the srpa stability matrix , namely a supermatrix comprising the rpa stability matrix , will be positive ( semi-)definite as well . as a result , and as already sketched , it remains perfectly possible to obtain srpa eigenstates with a ) imaginary ( even complex ) eigenvalues or b ) positive ( negative ) eigenvalues but with negative ( positive ) norm ( see eq .  ( 18 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite and remarks in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , contrary to common assumptions in the literature  @xcite , valid only for rpa .",
    "we will see numerical realizations of the above cases later on .",
    "the physical origin of the instability can be grasped with the help of the variational approach by da providencia  @xcite . for the reference state to minimize the expectation value of the hamiltonian",
    ", it is required that the 2nd and 3rd term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( 4 ) in @xcite vanish for all possible @xmath1 and @xmath2 variations .",
    "of course , in first - order rpa the @xmath2 amplitudes are set to zero from the beginning .",
    "the @xmath2 space is ignored .",
    "if the reference state minimizes the expectation value of the hamiltonian with respect to @xmath1 perturbations , then the rpa stability matrix is positive semi - definite , the first - order correction is zero , and the reference state satisfies the hf equations . on the other hand , for the reference state to minimize the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the @xmath8 space , the stability condition becomes that the srpa stability matrix be positive semi - definite and the first - order _ and _ the second - order correction vanish .",
    "this latter condition is simply impossible for a single slater determinant in all physical cases of interest .",
    "therefore , when we build the srpa matrix using the hf solution as the reference state , we have no grounds for expecting the stability matrix to be positive ( semi-)definite .",
    "it should come as no surprise if second - order perturbative corrections lower the ground - state energy with respect to hf .",
    "our contentions are not in contradition to the recent derivations of ref .",
    "@xcite , where positive semi - definitness was proven on the condition that a subtraction procedure be applied .",
    "our derivations for the usual srpa correspond to the case @xmath39 ( no subtraction ) in that work .",
    "the role of high - order correlations in satisfying the stability condition has been pointed out explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the indefiniteness of the stability matrix affects some of the derivations of sec .  5 in ref .",
    "the proof of orthogonality holds for all eigenvectors with real eigenvalues . for such vectors",
    "the normalization @xmath40 ( eq .  ( 22 ) in @xcite ) is possible .",
    "it does not follow automatically , however , that positive eigenvalues correspond to vectors of positive norm : if in @xmath41 ( eq .  ( 18 ) in @xcite ) the matrix is not positive definite , it is possible to find an eigenvector whose norm and eigenvalue have opposite signs  @xcite  it becomes , in fact , necessary",
    ". let us call such solutions antinormal for convenience .",
    "in particular , we may introduce the notation @xmath42 while greek letters @xmath43 will denote any kind of eigenvalue .",
    "it still follows that the norm can only be zero if @xmath4 is zero .",
    "it also follows that the set of srpa solutions is complete , as long as there are no zero - energy ( or complex ) solutions .",
    "the unity matrix in the complete @xmath24 space spanned by the solutions @xmath44 can be expanded as : @xmath45 it is straightforward to show that the above expansion acts as the unity matrix on any of the basis arrays .",
    "the total number of states is even : for each positive - norm solution there will be a negative - norm solution of _ opposite _ ( not necessarily _ negative _ ) energy .",
    "the variational principle proven in sec .",
    "5.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite is modified in the presence of antinormal solutions : then the lower limit is no longer @xmath46 , but a negative number , namely @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the highest one amongst positive antinormal eigenvalues .",
    "let us now prove eq .",
    "( 34 ) of ref .",

    "@xcite follows and our statement ( [ eq : ewsrnew ] ) has been proven .",
    "if the operator @xmath53 is a single - particle operator , @xmath2 configurations do not contribute in the evaluation of the right - hand side in the above equation .",
    "therefore , as already mentioned , the energy - weighted sum is the same in rpa and srpa , as long as the same hf reference state is used and the same @xmath1 space is considered . the same is true for the diagonal approximation to srpa , whereby the couplings within the @xmath2 space ( i.e. , in the @xmath29 matrix ) are neglected.we shall denote the diagonal approximation as srpa0 .",
    "thouless theorem on energy - weighted sum rules @xcite , i.e. , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ewsrnew ] ) above , has the important consequence that , when the ( stable ) hf solution is used as the rpa reference state , rpa solutions associated with broken symmetries ( translational and rotational invariance , in particular)the so - called _ spurious _ solutions  will appear at zero energy .",
    "the proof of the above statement can be cast as follows .",

    ". we shall call it , quite loosely , a _ spurious _ operator , for convenience .",
    "examples of spurious operators include the total , center - of - mass momentum , or the center - of - mass coordinate , @xmath55 , or the 3rd projection of the latter , which is a dipole operator .",
    "since the double commutator with the intrinsic hamiltonian vanishes , it follows that @xmath56 which is impossible if the stability matrix is trully positive - definite : the left - hand side would be bound from below by a positive number . since in rpa there",
    "can not be negative eigenvalues , the matrix must be positive semi - definite , i.e. , have a vanishing eigenvalue , @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding rpa eigenvector @xmath58 will be orthogonal to itself .",
    "the contribution of finite , positive - energy eigenvalues to the energy - weighted sum must vanish , hence no spurious strength can be found at finite energy ( we shall return to this point in relation to space completeness ) .    as already put forth in ref .",
    "@xcite , the above should hold for srpa too , provided that the srpa stability matrix were positive - definite .",

    "each of the other , physical states contributes very little spurious strength by comparison  but the energy - weighted sum of their spurious strengths is exactly the opposite of the spurious state s contribution .",

    "( [ eq : unity ] ) , which presumes completeness .",
    "one way to proceed is as follows .",
    "consider the sum of the intrinsic hamiltonian and a small admixture of a term , @xmath59 ( e.g. , @xmath60 may be the center - of - mass kinetic energy ) such that , for a spurious operator @xmath53 ( e.g. , a spatial operator acting on the center of mass ) , @xmath61 = \\epsilon_1 [ o , h ' ] \\rightarrow \\langle 0 | [ o , h , o ] | 0 \\rangle   = \\epsilon \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath62 are infinitesimal quantities .",

    "the point remains then that , in the limit of an intrinsic hamiltonian and a spurious operator , excitations of finite energy have no contribution to the rpa energy - weighted sum , owe it to the very small energy ( spurious ) or the very small transition matrix element ( physical ) .",
    "the rpa energy - weighted sum in the presence of broken symmetries has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , with emphasis on rotational symmetry .",

    "@xcite .    from the above",

    "it has been observed  @xcite , that very collective states ( giant resonances ) in srpa have lower energies than in rpa , but approximately the same strength .",
    "more to the point , it appears that the energy - weighted sum in the giant - resonance region must be lower in srpa than in rpa .",

    "upon exhaustion of the @xmath2 space the spurious state is found at @xmath101  mev .",
    "the value can be much more negative in larger harmonic - oscillator spaces : in ref  @xcite , for example , the positive - norm counterpart of the spurious state visible in fig .",
    "8 is found at about -7.5  mev .    since in this case @xmath10 and",

    "the points corresponding to rpa , namely @xmath105 in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1 ] , were obtained after scaling the residual interaction by 0.999 , which brings the spurious state to the real value of 18  kev .",
    "all other results were obtained without any scaling .",
    "first we observe that the srpa and srpa0 results practically coincide , as they should .",
    "we now look at the srpa(0 ) results as a function of @xmath97 , i.e. , as we enlarge the @xmath2 space .",
    "we observe readily that the total energy - weighted sums for all operators are the same in srpa(0 ) as in rpa , regardless of @xmath97 .",
    "the spurious state does not contribute to the sum for the intrinsic operator , while the spurious operator gets practically opposite contributions from the physical states ( not shown ) and from the spurious one , so that the shown total sum is practically zero regardless of @xmath97 .",
    "we observe , furthermore , that the _ total _ sum for the mixed operator is very close to that for the intrinsic operator , even though the contribution of the spurious state changes significantly  and , accordingly , the contribution of the physical states ( not shown ) changes in the opposite direction .",
    "finally , the spurious - state contribution to the mixed - operator sum equals its contribution to the spurious - operator sum ( @xmath106 is the spurious component of the mixed operator ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : m1 ]  ( b ) , the isoscalar operators @xmath107 ( mixed ) , @xmath108 ( spurious ) , and @xmath109 ( approximately intrinsic ) are examined .",
    "the conclusions are the same as for the isovector operators : all energy - weighted sums are practically the same in srpa(0 ) as in rpa , regardless of @xmath97 .",
    "the intrinsic - operator sum has practically no contribution from the spurious state , while the mixed - operator sum receives a negative contribution from the spurious state .",
    "the sums for the approximately intrinsic and mixed operators are slightly different already in rpa .",
    "again , the spurious - state contribution to the mixed - operator sum equals its contribution to the sum for the spurious operator @xmath108 .",

    "the opposite sign makes the total sum vanish .",
    "similarly , the contribution of physical states to the energy - weighted sum for a mixed operator is not the same as for the corresponding intrinsic operator .",
    "therefore in srpa(0 ) , unlike self - consistent rpa , the use of intrinsic operators is of essence .",

    "the occurance of complex states in the present application may be an artefact of the smaller basis .",
    "the presence of instabilities remains the persistent fact . in going from the 7-shell space to the 9-shell space ( both insufficient for convergence ) , the real part of @xmath130 shifts from @xmath133  mev to @xmath134 and 0  mev .",

    "it was found , that a large amount of spurious transition strength is exhausted by one antinormal state and the same energy - weighted amount is exhausted by the physical spectrum , so that the total energy - weighted summed strength vanishes .",
    "the present results further suggest that spurious admixtures are not of grave importance in the giant - resonance region , although they may be an issue for low - lying transitions ",

    ", the hf - srpa may retain its validity when certain conditions are met .",
    "existing studies employing exactly solvable models are inconclusive as regards the conditions in question  @xcite .",
    "apparently , the stronger the residual couplings in the hamiltonian ( and the resulting correlations ) are , the worse the agreement between srpa and the exact results is .",
    "the same holds for rpa , however , and for other extended formalisms .",
    "conclusive statements must therefore remain deferred . here",
    "we may propose as rather obvious conditions that the excitations of interest be described by single - particle operators ( e.g. , density fluctuations ) and can be shown to not be sensitive to ground - state correlations , and that corrected operators be used in the presence of spurious admixtures .",
    "the above seem to hold for the giant dipole and quadrupole resonances  @xcite , but not , for example , for @xmath136 transitions ( cf . the low - lying @xmath137 state of @xmath114ca ) which are strongly influenced by the depletion of the fermi sea .",
    "this issue deserves critical attention in applications of hf - srpa .    in the present work we have not employed three - body forces",
    "it is unlikely that the addition of three - body forces can eliminate the problematic formal properties of hf - srpa , since the hf solution will always be unstable against @xmath2 configurations . whether three - body or density - dependent forces moderate the instabilities , by introducing many more non - zero terms in the @xmath11 matrix , remains to be seen in large - scale calculations .",
    "a restricted @xmath2 space works to the same effect , as previous applications have shown  @xcite .",
    "a possibility not considered here is to employ a subtraction procedure  @xcite .",
    "this method seems attractive in the case of interactions which describe excitations well already on the level of rpa .",
    "then the purpose of srpa is solely to account for fragmentation .    for a wider range of applicability",
