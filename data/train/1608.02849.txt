    "a surface operator which we would like to study is a non - local defect with codimension-2 in four - dimensional gauge theories .",
    "this is a kind of disorder operators , like a t hooft line , which can not be expressed using fundamental fields in the theory rather should be specified by singular behaviors of them in approaching to the operators .",
    "this type of the operator in 4d is really special because the codimension is identical to the dimension supported by the operator , which is similar to the well - known fact that a gauge field has a classical ( anti)self - dual solution in the 4d gauge theory .",
    "the full characteristics of the surface operator as the disorder one is less understood than those of the order operator like a wilson line , though lots of attempts to completely classify the surface operator have been archived ( e.g. , see @xcite and a comprehensive review @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the surface operator can be used to investigate non - perturbative properties of the theories and uncover nontrivial consequences in the framework of the duality . in agt correspondence @xcite ,",
    "the insertion of the surface operator on the gauge theory side is interpreted as introducing a degenerate operator on the riemann surface @xcite , and this fact actually provides considerable aspects which we might not reach unless the surface operator is taken into account .    in this paper , we keep our attention on agt relation in the presence of the surface operator . this relation is originally encoded into m - theory where the 6d @xmath0 superconformal field theory as the worldvolume theory on multiple m5-branes is compactified on a four - sphere and a riemann surface . the surface operator which we mainly consider is naturally viewed as the boundary of a m2-brane ending on those m5 s which appear as a degenerate operator on the riemann surface .",
    "further , it is known that with utilizing string duality , agt correspondence is embedded into the system of @xmath1-fivebranes where we can apply the topological string computation . on the gauge theory side ,",
    "the topological string partition function just produces the 5d uplift of a nekrasov partition function which can really be reduced to the 4d one on the sphere . on the cft side ,",
    "the structure of the web digram for the @xmath1-fivebranes is mapped to the geometry of the riemann surface .",
    "in addition , the surface operator is encoded in this picture from the insertion of an extra d3-brane into the web diagram which corresponds to a lagrangian brane in the topological string .",
    "this relation through the web diagram in string theory is currently thought of as the 5d version of agt correspondence @xcite .",
    "there is another m - theory setup to understand the contribution from the m2 in more efficient way .",
    "this is named a m - string @xcite which is the boundary of the m2 suspended between two parallel m5 s ( the left side of figure [ proposal ] ) .",
    "it can be immediately seen that the m - string configuration is rewritten as the @xmath1-fivebrane web diagram again by using the power of string duality , and , accordingly , the refined topological string is used to calculate the partition function of the m - strings .",
    "it does not seem so simple that agt correspondence is interpreted as the language of the m - strings , however , in this work , we propose the m - string configuration which appropriately engineers agt correspondence in the presence of the surface operator .",
    "this new system includes an extra m5 in addition to the original m - strings , i.e. , the m2-m5 system on the flat background ( the right side of figure [ proposal ] ) , and this new m5 can geometrically engineer the surface operator via the geometric transition in the topological string @xcite . in other words , in the m - strings , the surface operator is realized not from the m2 in the usual m - theory construction of agt relation , but from the m5 intersecting with one of the original m5 in m - strings .",
    "we will discuss this point based on t - duality in section [ mstrings ] .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ surface ] , we shortly review how the surface operator is engineered via the geometric transition of the bubbling calabi - yau in the refined topological string . in section [ mstrings ]",
    ", it is explained that our m - string configuration with an additional m5-brane can produce the surface operator in agt correspondence .",
    "we exactly compute the contribution of this new m5 based on the refined topological vertex , which turns to be equivalent to the elliptic genus of the 2d @xmath2 @xmath3 theory as expected from the m - theory point of view . finally , we summarize the results and comment on several outlooks in section [ sum ]",
    ". the definitions of the refined topological vertex and the detailed computation of the m - strings are included in appendix [ convension ] .",
    "in agt correspondence @xcite , the presence of the surface operators in the 4d gauge theories is expressed just as the insertion of the degenerate operators on the riemann surface into the correlation function in cfts @xcite . the surface operator in agt relation is usually originated from inserting the m2-brane on m5-branes by hand . instead",
    ", we can built the situation in the presence of the surface operator by taking the specific limit via agt relation .",
    "on the cft side , a regular puncture in this limit turns to be a degenerate operator on the riemann surface , which means that the corresponding surface operator just arises in the 4d gauge theory .",
    "it is physically unclear in the field theory viewpoint why this may occur only with tuning the parameters to such special values .",
    "however , we can give somehow intuitive explanation for this construction of the surface operators @xcite by using the geometric engineering in the topological string theory @xcite .",
    "let us briefly review this prescription .",
    "we focus on one example from now on which will be used in the next section .",
    "the starting point is the so - called @xmath4 quiver gauge theory , a certain 4d @xmath5@xmath6@xmath5 gauge theory , which has the description of the @xmath7-fivebrane web diagram .",
    "the corresponding cft is on the torus with two primary fields ( punctures ) denoted by @xmath8 ( the left side of figure [ deglim ] ) , where @xmath9 represents the theory on the riemann surface with @xmath10 punctures and @xmath11 handles .",
    "then , the degeneration limit of @xmath8 which we consider to produce the surface operator insertion is , @xmath12 where , in the gauge theory language , @xmath13 is a su@xmath14 gauge holonomy and @xmath15 are masses of the matters corresponding to scaling dimensions in the cft .",
    "@xmath16 is one of @xmath17-deformation parameters .",
    "this is because , on flat background @xmath18 , the surface operator along @xmath19 is affected by an u@xmath20 rotation labelled by @xmath21 .",
    "then , @xmath8 in the limit results in @xmath22 with a degenerate operator , that is , the theory on the torus with one puncture and one degenerate field ( the right side of figure [ deglim ] ) .",
    "the dictionary of agt relation tells us that @xmath22 is mapped to the @xmath23 @xmath5 gauge theory with a surface operator on the gauge theory side .",
    "this 4d theory can actually be built also from the web diagram with the insertion of a lagrangian brane in the sense of the topological string .",
    "the reason for the appearance of the surface operator simply from the degenerate limit now becomes obvious in terms of the geometric transition in the web diagram , which we will explain in the next subsection .",
    "the geometric transition ( or the open / closed duality ) provides the connection between a brane and a background geometry .",
    "let us begin the argument with the web diagram shown in the left side of figure [ deglim ] known as the bubbling calabi - yau @xcite . on this diagram , khler parameters @xmath24 and",
    "@xmath25 which essentially characterize sizes of the branes are set in the standard way ( the left side of figure [ degenerate ] ) and reduce in the limit to @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we now consider the meaning of this specialization for the unrefined case ( @xmath29 ) . that @xmath30 becomes 1",
    "implies that the brane associated with this khler parameter reduces to the zero size , in contrasts , the nontrivial @xmath31 value turns to be the topological string coupling @xmath32 ( the left side of figure [ geosurface ] ) .",
    "then , we apply the geometric transition with this specific limit which translates the branes into the geometry .",
    "the diagonal one attached on the right leg in the left side of figure [ geosurface ] represents a @xmath33 with size @xmath32 , and after the transition this goes to the insertion of a lagrangian 3-cycle @xmath34 depicted by the dotted line in the right side of figure [ geosurface ] .",
    "the other attached on the left leg in the left side of figure [ geosurface ] shows the zero size @xmath33 , which leads to the lagrangian 3-cycle without the brane . according to the geometric transition",
    ", the toric brane realization of the surface operator in the closed topological string with the degenerate limit can be nicely explained by the open string topological string expressed as the insertion of the dotted line in figure [ geosurface ] .",
    "the elliptic uplift of the unrefined version of the degenerate limit is actually which can be verified from the cft via agt relation .    to justify this construction of the surface operator quantitatively",
    ", we move to the partition function of this web diagram which can be computed based on the refined topological vertex @xcite .",
    "the consequence of the specialization affects it as follows . after doing the limit",
    ", this partition function contains the factor @xmath35 where @xmath36 are young tableaux assigned in gluing the building blocks of the web diagram .",
    "it can be easily seen that this vanishes if @xmath37 includes even at most one box and @xmath38 has the box on the site @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , we just obtain the nontrivial result only when we restrict the case ( figure [ gluelim ] ) @xmath40 \\hspace{1em } ( n = 0 , 1 , 2 , \\cdots ) ,      \\end{aligned}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 $ ] is the young tableau of a column with @xmath10 boxes . with this limitation ,",
    "the refined topological string partition function turns to be the nekrasov partition function in the presence of the surface operator , called the ramified instanton partition function , for the @xmath42 @xmath5 gauge theory .",
    "also , it can be checked that it just matches the conformal block for the degenerate operator in @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "note that this prescription can be straightforwardly applied to more general bubbling calabi - yau s , but we still keep attention to the simplest case shown above for avoiding complexity of calculations .",
    "in the previous section , we reviewed the topological string realization of the gauge theory with the surface operator .",
    "then , it has been found that we can calculate the ramified partition function by using the refined open topological string on the certain non - compact calabi - yau manifold @xcite . in terms of the web diagram , this topological string theory is similar to the m - strings set up @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can expect that there is some relation between the m - strings and the refined open topological string theory .",
    "in this section , we consider the m - strings realization for this refined open topological string theory .",
    "then , we will find that , by inserting one more m5 brane to the originai m - strings set up , this topological string theory is dual to the m - strings set up .",
    "then , we calculate the partition function of the m - strings by using the refined topological vertex formalism , which leads to agt correspondence @xcite .      to begin with , we review the m - strings .",
    "let us consider @xmath43 m5-branes in the @xmath44 ale space and separate them by introducing @xmath45 m2-branes ( figure [ m - strings ] ) .",

    ". however , the calculation of this web diagram is rather complicated .",
    "instead , we propose an alternative method to calculate .",
    "the key ideas are agt correspondence in the presence of the surface operator @xcite and the bubbling calabi - yau @xcite shown in the previous section . as explained in the previous section , the fact that the insertion of the surface operator corresponds to the insertion of the degeneration field in agt correspondence is encoded into the topological string formalism ( fig.[agt ] ) with the limit of the khler parameters .",

    ", this gauge theory may be the @xmath70 @xmath3 gauge theory with an adjoint chiral multiplet and a fundamental chiral multiplet .",

    "the standard method in completing the integral with choosing appropriate paths is called the jeffrey - kirwan residue @xcite , but this calculation seems quite intricate .",

    "this agreement justifies our duality picture in the m - strings configuration which geometrically engineers the surface operator in agt relation .",
    "in summary , we found a new m - string configuration where an additional m5 intersecting with one of two parallel m5 s can geometrically engineer the surface operator in the 4d gauge theory via agt correspondence .",
    "based on the string duality chain , this m - theory picture is translated into the standard web diagram corresponding to the open topological string . therefore , the partition function of our m - strings under the twist can be evaluated by the refined topological vertex with the particular preferred direction .",
    "further , taking t - duality in the another direction provides the d1-d5 system on the @xmath82 ale space dual to our m - theory picture , which means that its partition function may also be identical to the elliptic genus of the 2d @xmath63 theory realized on d1 s .",
    "we gave a nontrivial support for our proposal to the m - strings by seeing the agreement of the partition function of the refined topological string with the elliptic genus .",
    "we would like to close the paper with some comments on interesting open questions .",
    "firstly , our result for the new m - strings system must be mathematically equivalent to the 5d nekrasov partition function derived in @xcite since physics does not depend on the selection of the preferred direction of the refined topological vertex .",
    "it is necessary to establish this equality to be able to support our proposal on agt correspondence .",
    "further , the geometric transition technique which we accepted can be applied to more general bubbling calabi - yau s , namely , it seems possible to generate wide varieties of agt correspondence in the presence of more general surface operators .",
    "secondly , although the bubbling geometry before the geometric transition is descended from m - theory on the @xmath82 ale space , the toric brane diagram after the geometric transition can be uplifted to m - theory on the flat space but with the extra m5 .",
    "there is no ambiguity in the meaning of the geometric transition from the standpoint of string theory , but it is obscure if the operation of the geometric transition connects two m - theory configurations on the absolutely distinct backgrounds . to answer how we can interpret it in the m - theory picture perhaps brings a new insight to m - theory .    finally , we need to establish the direct check of preserving @xmath63 supersymmetry from the viewpoint of d1 s on the @xmath82 ale space",
    ". this amount of supersymmetry is basically expected from the m - strings with the insertion of the m5 on the flat space , and in fact @xmath63 have been observed in @xcite for the m2-branes suspended between a flat m5-brane and a curved m5-brane , which are actually similar to our m - strings .",
    "however , the dual picture of the d - d5 system includes the orbifolded background , that is , the @xmath82 ale space . the way to put the branes on a orbifolded space is normally used to make supersymmetry be chiral as well as the original m - string configuration is dual to another d1-d5 system on the ale space whose worldvolume theory keeps @xmath83 @xcite , but this argument highly depends on which directions the background d5 s extend to . we wonder whether there is a essential connection of the m5 in our m - strings to the curved one in @xcite and would like to explicitly clarify the appearance of @xmath63 supersymmetry . those points become keys to verify our proposal .",
    "we hope that we can further report resolutions to the above issues in the near future .",
