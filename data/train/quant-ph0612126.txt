    "physical systems are described in terms of kinematical observables such as position , momentum , and spin . in the presence of symmetries , only a subset of those quantities ",
    "the physical observables  are physically relevant , as they too must obey the same symmetries .",
    "one way of obtaining physical observables is to use some systems as references relative to which the properties of other systems can be measured , yielding observables which are _ relational_. the state of the reference on its own can not be measured : only its correlations with other systems acquire physical meaning through direct measurements . in many circumstances , the existence of a suitable reference is conspicuous , often blurring the distinction between kinematical and relational observables .",
    "for example , the walls of a laboratory can be used to align a stern - gerlach apparatus to very high precision .",
    "this reference enables one to measure any component of an electron s spin , despite the rotational invariance of the underlying theory .",
    "while this statement may seem contradictory , it is only due to the fact that the reference was omitted from the description of the measured quantity .",
    "formally , the spin of the electron is only determined _ relative _ to the orientation of the measurement apparatus ( and ultimately the laboratory walls , the stars , etc . ) and all symmetries are respected . when the reference systems are classical , whether or not to include them in a given physical description is purely an aesthetic choice which has no impact on physical predictions @xcite .",
    "these  two sides of the same coin \" are analogous to doing calculations in electromagnetism with a special choice of gauge or using the gauge invariant language : each approach has its advantages .",
    "however , if the measuring device ( or at least certain essential parts of it ) are inherently _ quantum mechanical _ , these distinctions become more relevant . for example , it was pointed out long ago by wigner @xcite that a quantum mechanical conservation law places constraints on the ability to obtain precise measurements of certain observables ( see also the strengthening @xcite ) .",
    "similar arguments can be made for clocks , rods and gyroscopes , as they are also often taken for granted and omitted from the theoretical description of the situation at hand .    in this paper , we study a model of quantum measurement in which the task is to measure the angular momentum of spin-@xmath0 particles along some given direction , in the presence of a rotational symmetry .",
    "the information about the axis along which to measure is supplied by a quantum mechanical reference system .",
    "we will not only study the limitations this model places on performing perfect measurements  rather , we will focus on how the measurements affect the reference , and thus how they change the character of measurements performed with the same reference at later times .",
    "while omitting the description of the reference at hand is often entirely justified from a practical standpoint , this issue has been the source of a great deal of confusion and heated debates .",
    "one illustration , particularly disputed in the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) community , is the definition of an order parameter as either a local expectation or a correlation function .",
    "the former idea leads to the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite , where the field acquires a finite expectation value prohibited by the symmetry .",
    "the latter idea views one part of the bec as a reference relative to which the expectation of the field at another point in the bec can be measured , thus illustrating the importance of correlation functions @xcite .",
    "similar debates have taken place with regard to the phase of a laser field @xcite being either absolute or only defined relative to a reference pulse .",
    "another important example occurs in general relativity , where the group of symmetries consists of diffeomorphisms of spacetime .",
    "indeed , the issues concerning physical observables in general relativity are among the most profound in physics as they raise , among other things , questions regarding the measurability of time @xcite , as well as that of the spacetime metric @xcite itself . once again , some of these conceptual difficulties can be circumvented by a careful analysis of the role of the reference systems involved in our description of nature @xcite .",
    "we expect that resolving such foundational issues would be an important step towards the much - sought - after marriage between quantum mechanics and general relativity at the heart of current theoretical physics research .",
    "quantum mechanical descriptions of reference systems have revealed important physical consequences .",
    "these include the possibility of breaking certain superselection rules @xcite and the existence of an intrinsic decoherence in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "however , it is the study of quantum reference systems as _ physical resources _ that has recently received the most attention . indeed , using the tools of quantum information science , one can quantify the cost of establishing a reference between two distant parties @xcite , the cost of realizing a reference with a desired degree of accuracy @xcite , etc .",
    "( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "the latest addition to the theory of quantum reference systems is the study of their _ degradation _ under repeated measurements @xcite .",
    "indeed , the very act of using a reference to measure a system typically decreases the accuracy with which it can make a subsequent measurement on another system . studying specific models",
    ", the authors of @xcite came to the conclusion that this measurement accuracy typically decreases as the square - root @xmath1 of the number of measured systems @xmath2 , or in other words , that the so - called longevity of a reference is proportional to the square of its size . here",
    ", we revisit one of their models and analyze its dynamics in more detail .",
    "we show how their result follows from simple physical principles based on symmetries and conservation laws which are applicable even to general systems .",
    "we also find that the case analyzed by those authors is in fact quite singular and does not reflect the general behavior of a reference s longevity , which we instead find to scale _ linearly _ with its size in the generic case . as we observe in sec .",
    "[ sec : timea ] , this distinction exists because the source particles cause the reference to undergo a random walk whose dynamics are dominated by fluctuations when the source particles are unpolarized and by drift when they are polarized .",
    "the importance of studying quantum reference frame degradation stems not only from its repercussions on fundamental physics outlined above , but also from its relevance to realistic experimental settings ( see e.g.  @xcite for a description of experimental realizations relatively similar to our theoretical idealization ) .",
    "in particular , such effects are likely to play an important role in the realization of quantum information processors .",
    "we will elaborate on this aspect in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : model ] sets the stage by introducing the model that we study and describing the task it is meant to accomplish .",
    "[ sec : asymptotic ] presents an analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the reference system .",
    "the following section studies the thermalization time required to reach this asymptotic state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : non - eq . ] , we derive semi - classical equations of motion that model the dynamics of the reference system during the equilibration process .",
    "the last section summarizes our results and discuss some of their implications .",
    "our primary object of study is essentially a gyroscope , i.e.   a physical system that singles out a particular direction in three - dimensional space . in principle",
    ", an ideal ( classical ) gyroscope would allow an experimenter to measure the spin of a spin-@xmath0 _ source _ particle along the axis of rotation of the gyroscope .",
    "the quantum analog of a gyroscope is a system with a large amount of spin ; we henceforth refer to such a system as a _",
    "reference_. the state of the reference is described by a density matrix @xmath3 on the spin-@xmath4 irreducible representation ( irrep ) of @xmath5 . throughout",
    ", we will consider @xmath4 , or equivalently the dimension @xmath6 , as an indication of the _ size _ of the reference .",
    "ideally , the reference will be in a coherent state and will thus have a maximal amount of angular momentum concentrated in some direction @xmath7 .",
    "we only allow the experimenter to operate on the system and the reference in a rotationally invariant manner .",
    "thus , the only non - trivial observable to which the experimenter has access is the total angular momentum of the source particle and reference . when used in this fashion",
    ", the quantum reference differs from its classical counterpart in two fundamental ways :    1 .   the measurements will only be an approximation of what would be obtained by using the corresponding classical reference .",
    "each time the reference is used , it suffers an inevitable  back - action \" which ultimately changes the character of future measurements .    in any practical scenario , this reference would in general consist of a _",
    "composite _ system , e.g.  composed of the many electron spins of a ferromagnet .",
    "that only the @xmath5 degrees of freedom represented by @xmath3 are of interest implies that we are assuming that all the constituent particles of the gyroscope are used in a symmetric manner , and so can be considered as a single particle with large angular spin @xmath4 , such as a rydberg atom .",
    "other interactions will typically lead to a shorter longevity of the reference , but we are here interested in the fundamental upper bound which physics places on its longevity .    while the physics we analyze is independent of any background reference frame , our mathematical analysis requires us to choose one .",
    "this artificial background coordinate frame should be thought of as a choice of gauge with respect to which the underlying physics is insensitive . in terms of these background coordinates ,",
    "the @xmath5 generators of the reference are kinematic observables which we denote @xmath8 .",
    "these operators satisfy ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath9 = i\\epsilon^{ijk}l_k \\label{eq : su2}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the completely antisymmetric tensor for which @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding raising and lowering operators @xmath12 satisfy @xmath13 = 2 l_z , \\hspace{.3 in } [ l_z , l_\\pm ] = \\pm l_\\pm .",
    "\\label{eq : ladder}\\ ] ]    consider now a source which emits spin-@xmath14 particles , each described by the same density matrix @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding angular momentum operators @xmath16 also satisfy the commutation relations given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : su2 ] ) .",
    "the constrained relational observable allowing us to measure the spin of the particle relative to the quantum reference is the square of the total spin operator @xmath17 .",
    "since @xmath18 and @xmath19 are in the center of the algebra , @xmath20 ( and arbitrary functions thereof ) is the only non - trivial operator that can be measured in our toy universe .",
    "measurement of this observable projects the combined state of the system and the reference onto an eigenspace of @xmath21 with eigenvalue @xmath22 , where @xmath23 . after this measurement",
    ", we assume that the measured source particle is discarded and that the measurement result is forgotten ; in other words , the measurement scheme is non - adaptive .",
    "while it is an interesting question whether or not the history of results from subsequent measurements could potentially be used to give a more accurate description of the dynamics of the reference , we do not consider such approaches in this paper .",
    "we now describe the measurement induced on the source particle by the joint measurement of @xmath20 .",
    "this projective measurement on the combined system induces a positive operator valued measurement ( povm ) on the source .",
    "to find an expression for this povm , we begin by writing the respective projections onto the @xmath24 irreps as @xmath25 the measurement @xmath26 induced on the source is now given by a partial trace over the reference , which yields @xmath27 note that the measurement depends only on the expectations @xmath28 of the angular momentum of the reference .",
    "defining the 3-vector @xmath29 , whose norm is bounded by 1 , this becomes @xmath30 thus , we see that the relational observable is approximating a measurement of the spin of the source particle along the axis @xmath31 , or rather , of the observable @xmath32 . in the classical limit , where @xmath33 , the povm elements become the spectral projectors associated to the observable @xmath34 , and",
    "so the measurement is perfect .",
    "suppose that we set out to measure the the spin of the source along the direction @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , we seek to measure the projections @xmath36 as we have seen , the measurement @xmath26 which will actually be performed by our method will rather be an imperfect simulation of @xmath37 .",
    "there are various operational criteria which can be defined to judge the quality of this simulation .",
    "one such measure @xcite is the probability of correctly identifying a maximally polarized source which is prepared along the directions @xmath38 with equal probabilities .",
    "this average success probability depends linearly on the inner product @xmath39 and can be written as @xmath40 other figures of merit could be considered , such as the worst - case success probability for identfying the above source states , or perhaps another average error in which those source states appear with unequal probabilities .",
    "it is however easy to see that these criteria differ from @xmath41 by @xmath42 and are thus essentially equivalent .",
    "there are two distinct properties of the reference that contribute to @xmath39 . on the one hand",
    ", the length of @xmath43 could be less than 1 .",
    "indeed , when @xmath44 and @xmath43 are aligned , we find that @xmath45 .",
    "this is the scenario that was studied in @xcite and leads to a  fuzzy \" measurement  a mixing of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 measurement outcomes . on the other hand , @xmath44 and @xmath43",
    "may be misaligned , where the reference singles out a direction that differs from the direction we initially set out to measure . in this case , the reference still leads to precise measurements ; they just do nt happen to coincide with what we are interested in .",
    "an important result that we will establish here is that degradation of a reference under repeated uses typically lead to misalignment rather than fuzzy measurements .",
    "the authors of @xcite defined the _ longevity _ of the reference to equal the number of times that the reference can be used before the above figure of merit drops below some constant value .",
    "they found that the longevity of a reference , when used to measure unpolarized source particles , scales quadratically with the size of the reference .",
    "we will see that even if the source particles are only slightly polarized , a sufficiently large reference will typically have a longevity which scales _ linearly _ with its size .      in this section",
    "we derive exact expressions for the disturbance experienced by the reference after being used to measure a source particle .",
    "we will find that just as the induced povm on the source particle depends only on the average angular momentum @xmath48 of the reference , this back - action can be expressed as a _ quantum channel _ , or completely positive trace preserving ( cptp ) map , which depends only on the average angular momentum @xmath49 of the source . since @xmath50 a measurement of the total angular momentum is equivalent to the two - outcome von neumann measurement @xmath51 .",
    "suppose the reference and source begin in the respective states @xmath3 and @xmath15 , after which the above joint measurement is performed and the source particle is discarded .",
    "this process causes the reference state to undergo a discrete time evolution given by the cptp map @xmath52 using ( [ projections ] ) , we may express this channel as @xmath53 it is clear that this expression is independent of the particular choice of background coordinates . for a polarized source ,",
    "we choose our background coordinate system so that @xmath15 commutes with @xmath54 , allowing us to write @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in this case , eq .  ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) can be written @xmath57 while not immediately clear from this expression , @xmath58 is invariant under rotations about the @xmath59 axis because the only symmetry breaking in ( [ eq : channel1 ] ) comes from the polarization of the source particles . in the event that the source particle is completely unpolarized , this implies that the action of the channel @xmath58 is rotationally invariant . in this case",
    ", @xmath58 reduces to an instance of the so - called  spin-@xmath4 \" channel introduced in @xcite .",
    "a more useful expression for @xmath58 can be obtained by straightforward manipulations which lead to @xmath60    when the reference is used to consecutively measure @xmath2 source particles , each of which is in the state @xmath15 , it will experience a disturbance which is described by the channel @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the usual composition .",
    "we may think of @xmath2 as a natural ( discrete ) time parameter for our problem and write the state of the reference after it has been used to measure @xmath2 particles as @xmath63 .",
    "these dynamics are the central interest of this paper .",
    "the dynamics of the reference implies a time dependence of its angular momentum @xmath64 $ ] . note that because the total angular momentum is a constrained relational observable , the measurement process preserves angular momentum",
    "it may however create a flow of angular momentum from the reference to the source particles .",
    "this explains the time dependence of @xmath65 .",
    "this time dependence will in turn induce a time dependence of the actual povm @xmath66 which is performed on the source particle at time step @xmath2 via eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lp],[eq : lm ] ) .",
    "thus , the quality of the measurements obtained by repeatedly using the same reference may in general _ degrade _ over time .",
    "we will now analyze the asymptotic state of the reference as @xmath67 .",
    "this is an important first step in understanding the general dynamics of a reference . in particular ,",
    "if the asymptotic state of the reference induces good measurements of the source , we may conclude that it has an infinite longevity .",
    "we may think of the stream of source particles as an infinite bath with which the reference interacts .",
    "the von neumann entropy of the bath particles is given by @xmath68 where for scalar @xmath69 , we have written @xmath70 for the binary shannon entropy .",
    "we may assume that the polarization of the source particles is induced by an external magnetic field of strength @xmath71 which is aligned with the positive @xmath59 axis .",
    "in this case , the average energy of each bath particle is equal to @xmath72 . in units",
    "where @xmath73 , we therefore conclude that the bath is at inverse temperature @xmath74 on physical grounds , we expect the reference to thermalize with the bath after being used to measure a large number of particles .",
    "the asymptotic partition function is thus anticipated to be @xmath75 leading to the asymptotic reference state @xmath76 . in the next subsection",
    ", we prove that this corresponds to the asymptotic state by showing that it is the unique fixed point of the quantum channel @xmath58 .",
    "meanwhile , let us investigate the usefulness of this asymptotic state to serve as a reference .",
    "clearly , the angular momentum @xmath77 of the reference in its asymptotic state is along the @xmath59 direction .",
    "thus , if the original purpose of the reference was to measure the spin of the source particles along an axis that differs significantly from @xmath59 , we conclude that it will fail to do so asymptotically simply because it will be misaligned .",
    "on the other hand , if the reference is meant to measure the spin of the source particles _ along their axis of polarization _ , then it may continue to serve this purpose in its asymptotic state . from our discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : merit ] , we know that the figure of merit is in this case given by the length of the vector @xmath78",
    ". the expectation of the @xmath59 component @xmath79 of the asymptotic reference s angular momentum , as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath80 , is given by @xmath81 using ( [ eqn : beta ] ) , we may rewrite this expression in terms of the source polarization @xmath82 to obtain @xmath83 note that this expression is an antisymmetric function of @xmath82 .",
    "in particular , the asymptotic reference state is well - defined when @xmath84 by continuity . in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal ] , we have plotted the normalized quantity @xmath85 for various reference sizes @xmath4 . from this , we can compute the figure of merit @xmath86 .",
    "observe that the case of an unpolarized source ( i.e.  @xmath87 ) is quite singular and leads to a completely different physical behavior of the reference than in the generic case .",

    "the transition sharpens as the reference s size increases , with a width of roughly @xmath95 , and to first order , we find that the slope of @xmath79 is either @xmath4 or @xmath95 accordingly . in the macroscopic limit , any source polarization induces a full reference polarization.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]      to check that the reference asymptotically reaches the thermal state discussed in the previous section , one can resort to a brute - force calculation that @xmath96 is a fixed point of @xmath58 .",
    "another instructive way to see this begins by writing @xmath3 in the basis @xmath97 which diagonalizes @xmath98 . by inspecting eq .",
    "[ alternateform ] , we see that @xmath58 does not mix the various diagonals of @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath99 for nonnegative numbers @xmath100 satisfying @xmath101 one may further check that this bound is saturated only when @xmath102 . therefore , when @xmath103 , these weights correspond to subnormalized conditional probabilities which asymptotically annihilate the off - diagonal terms of @xmath3 .",
    "abbreviating @xmath104 we may express the action of @xmath58 on diagonal states ( those which commute with @xmath98 ) as @xmath105 the conditional probabilities can be directly evaluated using eq .",

    "so far , we have derived expressions for the asymptotic state of the reference and have characterized its ability to measure the spin of the source particles in this state .",
    "we will now analyze how much time it takes for the reference to reach this asymptotic state . in circumstances where the asymptotic state is not a useful resource",
    " i.e. when it becomes misaligned or fuzzy  this thermalization time will set a fundamental upper bound on the longevity of the reference .      here , we give a straightforward derivation of a lower bound on the thermalization time , using only basic symmetry arguments .",
    "since measuring the total angular momentum of the combined system is a rotationally invariant process , it preserves angular momentum . to significantly disturb the state of a reference with large angular momentum requires  kicking it \" with comparable amount of angular momentum .",
    "when each source particle is in a state with angular momentum @xmath82 , the total angular momentum of the source particles is a binomial random variable .",
    "therefore , the _ typical _ states of @xmath2 source particles will have a total angular momentum given by @xmath112    in the case of an unpolarized source ( @xmath113 ) , the physical requirement to disturb the state of the reference leads to a number of measured particles @xmath114 ; the disturbance is due to _ fluctuations _ of the source s angular momentum .",
    "this explains the main results of @xcite . on the other hand , when the source is sufficiently polarized ( @xmath115 ) ,",
    "the disturbance is no longer dominated by fluctuations but rather by the bias , or drift , leading to a longevity @xmath116 .",
    "this argument is not restricted to the particular @xmath5 model we have been studying here ; it should extend to arbitrary reference systems as well .",
    "in particular , when the source particles are in random states , the expectation value of any traceless local operator will grow as the square - root of the number of particles .",

    "we showed that the measurement which is actually performed on the source depends only on the angular momentum of the reference .",
    "we then derived expressions for the quantum channel which describes the back - action on the reference and showed that its unique fixed point is a thermal state .",
    "it is also possible to characterize the asymptotic state of the reference as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the projector onto the ( @xmath177 dimensional ) symmetric subspace of @xmath178 .",
    "this expression is insightful when the reference is a composite system made up of @xmath179 spin-@xmath0 particles , as one can imagine that the particles of the reference get  exchanged \" with those of the source , while remaining in the spin-@xmath4 representation .",
    "we then estimated the amount of time it takes to approach the thermal state . for a polarized source",
    ", we saw that the thermalization time scales _ linearly _ with the size of the reference .",
    "the implications of this for the longevity of the reference are two - fold .",
    "if the source and reference begin in alignment , the longevity will be _ infinite _ for a sufficiently large ( but still finite ) reference size .",
    "this is because the asymptotic state will still have most of its angular momentum pointing in the original direction . in all other cases with a polarized source",
    ", the reference will reorient itself to become aligned with the source after a time that scales linearly with its size .",
    "we also gave a physical mechanism describing the main result from @xcite : for an unpolarized source , the thermalization time scales _ quadratically _ with the reference size because the dynamics is dominated by fluctuations rather than by drift .",
    "therefore , its longevity enjoys the same scaling .",
    "however , we saw that this type of behavior is quite non - generic ; unless the angular momentum of the source is _ exactly _ zero , a sufficiently large ( but finite ) reference will asymptotically retain a near maximal amount of angular momentum .",
    "the quadratic scaling , on the other hand , requires a precisely tuned source , reminiscent of the effort needed to ensure that a statistical system remains in the vicinity of its critical point .    finally , we initiated the analysis of the non - equilibrium dynamics of the reference , giving a semiclassical equation for the time - evolution of the reference .",
    "in particular , we found that if the reference begins in a coherent state , it will essentially remain in a coherent state throughout its evolution , provided that the source particles are not anti - parallel to the initial state of the reference .",
    "here , the reference simply rotates itself toward the final state in an essentially _ deterministic _ fashion .",
    "thus , while it loses its ability to perform the measurement for which is was originally intended , it will always be reasonably good at performing _ some _ particular measurement ( which is predicted by our equation ) at any given time .",
    "for an even better understanding of the semi - classical dynamics , it would be beneficial to also have an equation for the time evolution of the length @xmath147 of the reference , or at least to obtain an analytic bound on its minimal value throughout its evolution .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "our analysis is relevant for the realization of quantum information processors . for micro - fabricated architectures ,",
    "some components of the measurement device can be subject to quantum fluctuations and will thus feature effects similar to those analyzed in this paper .",
    "most schemes for fault - tolerant quantum computation ( see e.g.  @xcite ) utilize repeated measurements for syndrome extraction and post - selected state distillation . moreover , the measured particles will typically exhibit a strong bias ( e.g.  syndromes are more likely to be 0 than 1 ) , inducing a rapid degradation of the reference . on the other hand",
    ", it may also be possible to utilize such a source bias for stabilizing a reference , allowing sufficiently accurate measurements to be performed throughout an arbitrarily long computation .",
    "one could imagine extending the analysis put forth in this paper in a number of ways .",
    "for example , the reference could be used to measure the angular momentum of particles in higher representations of @xmath5 .",
    "additionally , more complicated lie groups could be substituted ; repeating our analysis in such cases would involve even further generalizations of channels studied in @xcite . as many of our arguments are based on general physical principles , we expect that the same scaling properties derived here would apply in those cases as well .",
