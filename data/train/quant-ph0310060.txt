    "it is well known that quantum theory allows for the implementation of cryptographic tasks with a degree of information - theoretic security that can not be achieved classically , with key distribution being the most famous example @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting among these tasks are the so - called  post - cold - war \" applications of cryptography , wherein two remote and mistrustful parties seek to cooperate towards some end .",
    "examples of these are bit commitment @xcite , strong coin flipping @xcite , weak coin flipping @xcite , bit escrow @xcite , and two - party secure computation @xcite . in this paper , we focus on elucidating a certain primitive we have identified as accounting for the ability of certain quantum two - party cryptographic protocols to outperform their classical counterparts .",
    "we begin by recalling a more familiar such primitive , specifically _ state estimation _",
    "@xcite : a system is prepared in one of a set of states , and passed on to an estimator . typically , the task of the estimator is to try , as best as possible , to determine which of the states describes the system .",
    "imagine , however , that the estimator is asked to announce his guess of the state and then is asked to resubmit the system , which is subsequently subjected to a pass / fail test for still being in the initially prepared state . in this case , the estimator s task is to guess the state without disturbing it . ] by doing nothing to the system , the estimator can make a random guess and avoid creating any disturbance .",
    "however , it is well known that any interaction with the system that leads to a greater probability of guessing correctly will necessarily also lead to a disturbance of the state @xcite .",
    "this phenomena is extremely important - for instance , it underlies the possibility of quantum key distribution .",
    "the focus of this paper is the task of passing a test for a target state , even though the system upon which the test is performed must be submitted prior to learning the target state s identity .",
    "we call this task _ state targeting_. state targeting is built of the same elements as the sort of state estimation task just discussed : there is a system and a set of states , one of which is distinguished",
    ". there is also a classical announcement of a state drawn from the specified set , and the most desirable announcement is an announcement of the distinguished state .",
    "finally , there is a pass / fail test on the system .",
    "what is different in state targeting is how these elements are organized , and the fact that the person implementing the task ( the player ) _ submits _ rather than _ receives _ the quantum system .",
    "more explicitly , a state targeting task proceeds as follows . at the outset",
    ", there is an unknown target state , drawn from a known set of states .",
    "the player submits a system , and only after doing so does she learn the identity of the target state . at this point ,",
    "the player must announce a state from the original set ( not necessarily the target state ) , and the system is subjected to a pass / fail test for the announced state .",
    "success is defined as announcing the target state and subsequently passing the test for this state .",
    "the player can always make a random guess of the target state initially , and thereafter announce this state and be sure to pass the test for this state .",
    "this will lead to some finite probability of announcing the target state while avoiding any risk of failing the final test .",
    "however , it turns out that any attempt to make the probability of announcing the target state greater than what is achieved with this trivial scheme results in a non - zero probability of failing the final test .",
    "this phenomena is analogous to the unavoidable disturbance that comes with information gain in state estimation .",
    "as one might expect , it too has interesting applications in quantum cryptography .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we provide a simple cryptographic motivation for our study , namely , a weak coin flipping(wcf ) protocol wherein one of the party s cheating strategies is an instance of state targeting .",
    "we also define the task of state targeting in greater detail than has been done in the introduction . in section iii , we consider state targeting where the target state is drawn uniformly from a pair of pure states .",
    "we determine the maximum probability of success , and investigate the rate at which the probability of failing the final test increases with the probability of success .",
    "section iv generalizes the notion of state targeting by allowing for the possibility that the player simply declines from announcing a state .",
    "this allows the player to achieve some non - trivial degree of success without running any risk of failing the final test .",
    "( this is analogous to the fact that some information gain without disturbance becomes possible in state estimation if one has the option to sometimes decline from resubmitting the system for testing . )",
    "this variant of the state targeting task is also shown to have a cryptographic motivation in terms of a weak coin flipping protocol . in section",
    "v , we optimize this variant in the case where the target state is drawn uniformly from a pair of pure states .    in the second half of the paper , we consider state targeting for mixed states .",
    "this requires a careful consideration of what to use as a test for a mixed state , and so we begin in section vi by addressing this question . in section vii",
    ", we consider the success that can be achieved in state targeting between a pair of mixed states , and in section viii , we examine the case where the player is allowed to sometimes decline from being tested .",
    "section ix refines the analogy that exists between state targeting and state estimation by focusing on a variant of state estimation , which we call state spying , wherein the estimator must resubmit the system for testing .",
    "we consider the applications of our results on state targeting and discuss some open problems in section ix .",
    "finally , in section x , we consider the classical analogue of state targeting , which highlights the inherently quantum mechanical features of this task .",
    "to emphasize the importance of state targeting in cryptography , and to motivate the sorts of problems that we shall address , it is useful to have an example of a protocol that makes use of this task . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce a very simple protocol for the two - party cryptographic primitive of weak coin flipping(wcf ) @xcite @xcite . here , two separated and mistrustful parties wish to engage in communication to generate a random bit , the value of which will fix a winner and a loser , in such a way that each party can be guaranteed that if they follow the honest protocol , the other party is limited in the extent to which they can bias the value of the bit in their favor .",
    "the simple weak coin flipping protocol we consider makes use of a pair of non - orthogonal pure states @xmath0,@xmath1 .",
    "if both parties are honest , it proceeds as follows .    *",
    "weak coin flipping protocol 1 *    alice chooses a bit @xmath2 uniformly from \\{0,1 } , prepares @xmath3 and sends the system to bob .",
    "bob chooses a bit @xmath4 uniformly from \\{0,1 } and announces it to alice ( one can think of this as bob s guess of the value of @xmath2 ) .",
    "alice announces @xmath2 to bob    bob tests the system for being in the state @xmath3 .    if at step ( 4 ) , the system fails bob s test , then alice is caught cheating . otherwise , if @xmath5 then bob wins , while if @xmath6 , then alice wins .",
    "alice may cheat by preparing the system in an arbitrary state of her choosing at step ( 1 ) , and making whatever announcement she pleases at step ( 3 ) .",
    "bob may cheat at step ( 2 ) by performing a measurement upon the system , and using the outcome to inform his decision of what @xmath4 to announce .",
    "the extent to which bob can cheat when alice is honest depends on the extent to which he can correctly estimate which of a pair of non - orthogonal states applies to the system , in order to make the best possible guess of @xmath2 and maximize his probability of making @xmath5 .",
    "the problem of state estimation has been extensively studied , and consequently the solution can be found in the literature @xcite . on the other hand , the extent to which alice can cheat when bob is honest depends on the extent to which she can pass a test for the state opposite to the one bob guessed , despite not knowing what bob s guess will be when she submits the system .",
    "we can state this as follows : her target state is determined by bob s announcement , which only occurs after she has submitted the system .",
    "this is a simple instance of state targeting .",
    "note that alice s announcement in step ( 3 ) of the protocol determines what state bob is to test for .",
    "alice can only win the coin flip if she announces a bit @xmath2 that is unequal to @xmath4 .",
    "however , if she announces @xmath7 without having initially prepared @xmath3 , then she runs a risk of failing bob s test .",
    "of course , alice may sometimes prefer to pass a test for the non - target state rather than failing the test for the target state .",
    "as such , she may not always ask bob to test for the target state .",
    "the task faced by a dishonest alice in our simple wcf protocol is just one instance of state targeting .",
    "more generally , a state targeting task is defined as follows :    alice submits a system to bob .",
    "alice learns the identity of the target state .",
    "alice announces a state to bob ( not necessarily the target state ) .",
    "bob performs a pass / fail test for the announced state .",
    "the possible outcomes are :    * alice announces the target state and passes bob s test * alice announces the target state and fails bob s test * alice announces a non - target state and passes bob s test * alice announces a non - target state and fails bob s test     success \" in state targeting is to achieve outcome ( a ) .",
    "thus , we can quantify the degree of success by the probability of this outcome .",
    "we call this probability alice s _ control _ we shall be interested in determining the maximum control achievable in state targeting .",
    "there are several ways in which alice might not succeed . in cryptographic applications ,",
    "it is reasonable to expect that failing one of bob s tests has a greater cost than passing the test for a non - target state , since the former indicates that alice has cheated .",
    "thus , it is useful to consider the total probability of failing bob s test , which is the sum of the probabilities for outcomes ( b ) and ( d ) .",
    "we call this probability alice s _ disturbance_.",
    "it is sometimes useful for alice to sacrifice some control to lower her disturbance .",
    "thus , we shall be interested in determining the minimal disturbance for a given control , which we refer to as the optimal _ control - disturbance trade - off_.",
    "consider the example of state targeting that is provided by our simple weak coin flipping protocol , namely , one wherein the target is selected uniformly from a pair of pure states , @xmath8 . if alice simply wishes to maximize her probability of announcing the target state and passing bob s test , that is ,",
    "if she is unconcerned about the relative probabilities of outcomes ( b),(c ) and ( d ) , then she should always announce the target state .",
    "her most general strategy at step ( i ) is to prepare the system in a ( possibly mixed ) state @xmath9 . in this case ,",
    "alice s control is c=_0||_0+_1||_1.noting that this can be rewritten as @xmath10 , it is clear that the maximum control is simply the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath11 and is achieved by choosing @xmath9 to be the associated eigenvector .",
    "explicitly , the maximum control is @xmath12 and the state that achieves it is    normalization factor , and the phases have been chosen so that @xmath13 is real .",
    "since the hilbert space spanned by any pair of pure states is two - dimensional , it can be represented using the bloch sphere picture . within this picture ,",
    "@xmath14 is represented by the point that lies halfway between the points representing @xmath0 and @xmath1 on the geodesic that connects them , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ blochmaxcontrol ] .     and @xmath1 .",
    "the state @xmath14 is the one that alice must submit to achieve her maximal control .",
    "if she submits the state @xmath15 , then she can achieve some non - trivial control at the cost of some disturbance by steering to a particular convex decomposition of the state prior to her announcement .",
    "the pair of states @xmath16 indicate the elements of a convex decomposition that alice might use where the target state is @xmath0 . in general the optimal state to submit in order to minimize her disturbance for a given control lies between @xmath15 and @xmath14.,width=226 ]      by achieving her maximum control ,",
    "alice runs a risk of failing bob s test .",
    "since she always announces the target state in this case , outcomes ( c ) and ( d ) never occur and her probability of failing bob s test ( her disturbance ) is simply the difference between 1 and her maximum control , that is , @xmath17 . if , on the other hand , alice exerts her trivial control of 1/2 by preparing @xmath0 or @xmath1 with equal probability and then announcing this state regardless of the identity of the target state , she creates no disturbance .",
    "we can imagine , however , that situations may arise wherein alice decides to achieve some non - trivial but non - maximal control .",
    "it is useful therefore to determine the minimal disturbance for every achievable degree of control .",
    "since we find that this function is monotonically increasing , it also specifies the maximum control for a given disturbance .",
    "we begin by making the observation that a second strategy for alice which achieves the trivial control with no disturbance is for her to couple the system she sends to bob with an ancilla that she keeps , thereby preparing the entangled state @xmath18 when it comes time to announce a state to bob , she simply measures the ancilla in the @xmath19 basis , registers the bit value @xmath2 of the outcome , and announces @xmath3 .",
    "in this situation the reduced density operator for the submitted system is latexmath:[$\\rho_h = \\frac{1}{2}| \\psi_0 \\rangle \\langle \\psi_0    on the bloch sphere by the point which lies halfway along the line joining the points corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath1 - this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ blochmaxcontrol ] .",
    "alice can now use the following trick to increase her control beyond the minimum value .",
    "suppose bob announces that the target state is @xmath0 .",
    "alice then implements a measurement on her ancilla of some basis distinct from the @xmath21 basis .",
    "this collapses the state of the submitted system to @xmath22 with some probability @xmath23 and to @xmath24 with probability @xmath25 ) .",
    "an example is depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "we assume that of the two states , @xmath22 has the greater overlap with @xmath0 ( as is the case in the figure ) , so that alice announces @xmath0 upon obtaining the outcome associated with @xmath22 , and she announces @xmath1 upon obtaining the outcome associated with @xmath24 .",
    "if the target state is @xmath1 , she exerts a similar strategy , collapsing the state of the submitted system to a different pair of states , @xmath26 or @xmath27 , with probabilities @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .    by this strategy",
    ", alice achieves a control of [ ccc ] c= q||_0|^2 + p||_1|^2 .",
    "her disturbance , which is her total probability of failing bob s test , is d&=&[q(1-||_0|^2)+(1-q)(1-||_1|^2 ] + & + & [ p(1-||_1|^2)+(1-p)(1-||_0|^2 ]    one might worry that of all the convex decompositions of @xmath15 , only some can be realized by performing a measurement on the ancilla . if this were the case , then this subset of convex decompositions would have to be characterized before we could proceed with the optimization .",
    "however , this is not a concern , because as is shown in refs . @xcite and @xcite ( and generalized to non - extremal decompositions in @xcite ) ,",
    "_ every _ convex decompositions of a mixed state can be achieved by some measurement on the ancilla .",
    "thus , we can vary over all convex decompositions with the assurance that there is a measurement that will achieve it .",
    "assuming @xmath0 and @xmath1 are non - orthogonal , @xmath15 lies off the centre of the bloch sphere , and consequently @xmath22 and @xmath24 ( which define the convex decomposition of @xmath15 ) can be chosen such that @xmath30 ; this follows from the fact that @xmath15 is geometrically closer to @xmath22 than to @xmath24 in the bloch sphere .",
    "similarly , alice can ensure that @xmath31 . despite the fact that alice has a non - unit probability of passing bob s test",
    ", her overall probability of success can increase .",
    "we do not expect that @xmath15 will correspond to the optimal @xmath9 for every value of the control that alice may wish to achieve .",
    "indeed , we already know that in order to achieve her maximum control , she must submit a different state , indicated by @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ blochmaxcontrol ] .",
    "thus we expect the optimal @xmath9 to be an interpolation between @xmath15 and @xmath14 as we increase @xmath32 from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "so , we must perform two optimizations : an optimization over the state @xmath9 of the submitted system , and an optimization over the convex decomposition of @xmath9 she should realize prior to announcing to bob which state he should test for .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the optimal @xmath9 has a bloch vector that bisects the bloch vectors representing @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and that the optimal convex decomposition to realize when @xmath1 is the target state is simply the mirror image in the bloch sphere of the optimal convex decomposition when @xmath0 is the target state , so that @xmath35 .",
    "these simplifications leave us with a two parameter optimization problem : the one parameter corresponding to the length @xmath36 of the bloch vector representing @xmath9 , the other parameter corresponding to the angle between the bloch vectors representing @xmath0 and @xmath22 .",
    "although , we have not been able to perform this optimization analytically for very value of @xmath37 . the curve  ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ tradeoff ] depicts the optimal tradeoff for @xmath38 .",
    "in the context of the wcf protocol presented earlier , it may sometimes be the case that the consequences for alice if she is caught cheating are sufficiently dire that she wishes to avoid this outcome at all costs .",
    "the question then becomes whether this is enough to guarantee that she follow the honest protocol .",
    "for the case of two non - orthogonal target states , if alice submits some state distinct from one of these possibilities , then regardless of what she announces , she has a non - zero probability of failing bob s test .",
    "the only way to be certain to pass bob s test is to submit one of these states and to announce the same state , that is , to follow the honest protocol and achieve the trivial control of 1/2 .",
    "this is reflected in curve ( a ) of fig .",
    "( [ tradeoff ] ) by the fact that for every value of control greater than 1/2 the disturbance is non - zero .    nonetheless , there are useful versions of the task of state targeting wherein alice has the option of declining from announcing a state to bob , and in such cases , alice _ can _ achieve greater than the trivial control without incurring any disturbance .    we again introduce a simple wcf protocol as motivation .",
    "this differs from the previous one in that both alice and bob are tested for cheating , which results in a protocol that offers fewer cheating possibilities for bob , but more for alice .",
    "if both parties are honest , the protocol proceeds as follows .",
    "+ * weak coin flipping protocol 2 *    * alice chooses a bit @xmath2 uniformly from \\{0,1 } , prepares @xmath3 and sends the system to bob . *",
    "bob chooses a bit @xmath4 uniformly from 0,1 and announces it to alice ( one can think of this as bob s guess of which state alice submitted ) .",
    "* alice announces @xmath2 to bob + * if * @xmath5 , then * bob returns the system to alice , and alice tests the system for being in the state @xmath3 . + * else * , if @xmath6 , then * bob tests the system for being in the state @xmath3 .",
    "+ if at step ( 4 ) the system fails alices(bob s ) test , then bob(alice ) is caught cheating . otherwise , if @xmath5 then bob wins , while if @xmath6 , then alice wins .    as before , alice may cheat by preparing the system in an arbitrary state of her choosing , and making whatever announcement she pleases .",
    "the difference is that if she announces @xmath5 , then she is not tested by bob .",
    "this suggests a more general type of state targeting task , which differs from the one outlined in section [ motivating ] insofar as step ( iii ) is replaced by :    alice has the option of either ( a ) announcing a state to bob ( not necessarily the target state ) , or ( b ) declining to announce a state to bob .",
    "there is also an additional possible outcome relative to the version from the last section , namely :    alice declines to announce a state to bob .",
    "because of this additional outcome , alice can make her disturbance strictly zero while still achieving a non - trivial control .",
    "we call this _ disturbance - free state targeting_. the control that alice achieves by implementing her best disturbance - free state targeting is still defined as her probability of achieving outcome ( a ) .",
    "we call this her _ disturbance - free control _ , and denote it by @xmath39 .",
    "( an analogous quantity is defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is called alice s _ threshold for cheat - sensitivity_. )    the possibility of disturbance - free state targeting is analogous to something that occurs in _ unambiguous discrimination _ of pure states@xcite .",
    "( the latter is a procedure which either discriminates the states without any probability of error , or else simply returns the result `` inconclusive '' . )",
    "if the inconclusive outcome is _ not _ obtained , then the pure state with which the system was prepared is known with certainty , and can be re - prepared , so that a test for the initial state can be passed with certainty .",
    "if the inconclusive result _ is _ obtained , then the estimator declines from having the system tested .",
    "thus , the existence of an inconclusive outcome allows for the possibility of information gain without disturbance .",
    "analogously , the option to decline from being tested allows for non - trivial control without disturbance .",
    "we now demonstrate how disturbance - free state targeting is achieved in the case where the target state is chosen uniformly from two non - orthogonal pure states .",
    "the technique is similar to the one used to minimize the disturbance for a given control .",
    "alice initially couples the submitted system to an ancilla ( which she keeps ) so that the state of the pair is entangled . after learning the identity of the target state , she measures her ancilla in such a way that the state of the submitted system is updated according to a convex decomposition that contains the target state .",
    "if it happens to collapse to the target state , then she announces the target state , and is certain to pass bob s test .",
    "if it collapses to another state , then she simply declines to announce a state to bob .",
    "the fact that such a scheme can achieve a control greater than 1/2 can be seen by considering fig .",
    "( [ unambigbloch ] ) .",
    "if the state @xmath9 that alice submits falls between @xmath15 and the completely mixed state ( the centre of the bloch sphere ) , and she steers to a two - element convex decomposition containing the target state , then because @xmath9 is necessarily geometrically closer to the target state than to the other element of the decomposition , and because greater geometric proximity represents a greater probability of collapsing to that element @xcite , it follows that the probability of announcing the target state is necessarily greater than 1/2 .",
    "we now proceed to find the maximum probability of disturbance - free state targeting .",
    "we must vary over both the convex decompositions for a fixed submitted state , and over the submitted states .    in the first optimization",
    ", we seek to find the largest probability with which the target state appears in a convex decomposition of the submitted state .",
    "a corollary we prove in section ( [ dfst2mixed ] ) establishes that the maximum probability of collapsing the state @xmath9 to the state @xmath40 is .",
    "given that the target state is equally likely to be @xmath0 or @xmath1 , the disturbance - free control for a submitted state @xmath9 is [ expression4dfcontrol ] c _ = +    we can now consider the optimization over @xmath9 . since there is clearly no advantage to preparing a @xmath41 outside of the subspace spanned by @xmath42 and @xmath43 the problem can be entirely formulated in a two - dimensional hilbert space , so that we may use the bloch sphere representation of states .",
    "the optimization is done in appendix [ dfcontrol ] .",
    "the maximum disturbance - free control is found to be [ maxdfcontrol ] c^ _ _ c _ = .    the strategy that achieves this control requires alice to prepare a mixed state of the form @xmath44 where = 1- ( 1- ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the maximum disturbance - free control , eq .",
    "( [ maxdfcontrol ] ) , is less than the maximum control , eq .",
    "( [ maxcontrol ] ) , for any pair of states .",
    "thus , to avoid creating a disturbance , alice must pay a price in control .",

    ", the disturbance will be non - zero only for controls greater than the disturbance - free control .",

    "we consider this tradeoff in the simple case of two pure states .",
    "suppose that alice has submitted some @xmath9 and now learns that the target state is @xmath0 .",
    "as described in section [ cversusd ] , she can make a measurement on the ancilla which collapses the submitted system to either the state @xmath22 ( with probability @xmath23 ) or to state @xmath24 ( with probability @xmath50 ) .",

    "first of all , unlike the latter tests , alice can only pass this test with certainty if the state of the submitted system was @xmath56 .",
    "more importantly , it can be shown that for every convex decomposition test , there is a purification test that is equally or more difficult to pass .",
    "this is proven in appendix [ convspur ] .",
    "notwithstanding this fact , in the context of state targeting between a pair of mixed states , it is often possible to find a pair of convex decomposition tests that yield a maximum control as low as the maximum control for a pair of purification tests .",
    "an example is offered by the coin flipping protocols proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and in ref .",
    "@xcite , where alice s optimal cheating strategies are state targeting procedures that achieve the same control .",
    "because of the practical difficulty of generating , preserving and measuring entangled states , it is likely that , other things being equal , a pair of convex decomposition tests is preferable to a pair of purification tests for use in a cryptographic protocol",

    "it is clear that convex decomposition tests can not do better than purification tests and therefore for the rest of this paper we focus on the latter .",
    "we begin by motivating the generalization of state targeting to mixed states by describing another improvement on our simple weak coin flipping protocol .",
    "the protocol is defined in terms of a pair of states @xmath70 and @xmath71 on a bi - partite system , where the parts are denoted by @xmath66 and @xmath65 .",
    "if both parties are honest , it proceeds as follows .    *",
    "weak coin flipping protocol 3 *    alice chooses a bit @xmath2 uniformly from \\{0,1 } , prepares the system @xmath67 in the state @xmath72 and sends @xmath65 to bob .",

    "alice announces @xmath2 and sends the system @xmath66 to bob .",
    "bob tests the system @xmath67 for being in the state @xmath72 .",

    "@xmath72 is a purification of @xmath76 .",
    "thus , bob s test at step ( 4 ) is a purification test for @xmath76 .",
    "it should now be clear that alice s task when cheating is an instance of state targeting with two mixed target states , since the state @xmath76 that alice would like to pass a test for is determined by bob s announcement , which occurs after she has submitted system @xmath65 .    note that if @xmath70 and @xmath71 are taken to be product states , this protocol reduces to wcf protocol 1 . making use of entangled @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( equivalently , mixed @xmath74 and",
    "@xmath75 ) provides an improvement over wcf protocol 1 insofar as it provides better simultaneous security against alice and bob .",

    "@xcite ) , and the fact that the greatest fidelity for a given trace distance is achieved when @xmath74 and @xmath75 are mixed @xcite .    the only aspect of the definition of state targeting ( section  [ motivating ] ) that must be changed to accommodate the possibility of purification tests for mixed states is that at step ( iii ) , when alice announces a state to bob , she must also supply him with a message system , so that he may measure whether the submitted and message systems together are in a purification of the state announced .    in this section",
    "we explain the most general strategy which alice can employ in order to obtain non - trivial control in state targeting between two mixed states .    in order to increase her control",
    ", it may be to alice s advantage to make random choices .",
    "as is well known however@xcite , alice loses nothing by making these choices at a _ quantum _ level - that is , by entangling the system @xmath67 with an ancillary system @xmath77 which she retains .",
    "in general therefore , she will be preparing the system @xmath78 in an entangled state @xmath79 . the reduced density on the system @xmath65 which is submitted to bob is then @xmath80 .",
    "thus , in this case alice has submitted @xmath41 to bob .    prior to alice announcing to bob which state he should test for , she may implement a transformation on the systems @xmath81 that remain in her possession ( this includes the possibility of a measurement , since alice loses nothing by keeping the outcome at the quantum level ) .",
    "the most general transformation is described by a completely positive trace - preserving linear map . however , by neumark s theorem @xcite , an equivalent transformation can always be achieved using a unitary map and a larger ancilla .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , we can assume that alice implements a unitary transformation @xmath82 , where the subscript @xmath83 indicates that the operation which alice performs will generally depend on which of the states , @xmath74 or @xmath75 , is the target state .",
    "we denote by @xmath84 the probability that alice passes a test for @xmath76 , given that she submitted @xmath41 to bob and employs the interaction @xmath85 prior to sending @xmath66 to him .",

    "we are therefore performing an optimization of the form ( i ) above .",
    "when alice succeeds at passing a test for a state @xmath56 , we say that she has _ unveiled _ @xmath56 .",
    "this terminology is suggested by the application of state targeting to bit commitment .",
    "we wish to determine the maximum probability with which alice can pass a test for @xmath88 , i.e. unveil @xmath56 , given that she has submitted @xmath89    by the definition of a purification test , when alice wishes to unveil @xmath56 , she must send a message system @xmath66 to bob , who will then test whether the composite @xmath67 is in a particular purification @xmath90 of @xmath88 . as it turns out , the particular purification of @xmath56 that is used in the test does not affect the difficulty of the task .",
    "suppose for the moment that alice does not use an ancilla , and instead simply prepares @xmath67 in the pure state @xmath91 and implements a unitary @xmath92 on @xmath66 alone .",
    "in this case , the optimization problem reduces to finding the maximum probability with which a purification on @xmath67 of @xmath9 can pass the test for being a purification on @xmath67 of @xmath93 , and the solution is given by _",

    "this upper bound is sometimes saturated , for instance , when the two states are confined to a 2-d hilbert space with one being pure and the other being the completely mixed state .",
    "to motivate our study of state targeting , we have introduced a variety of weak coin flipping protocols wherein alice s cheating strategies are instances of state targeting .",

    "we shall call this task _ state spying_.    we begin by contrasting state spying to state discrimination .",
    "the latter is what occurs in the wcf protocols where bob is not tested . here",
    ", a cheating bob is faced with the following situation .",
    "alice has submitted a system prepared in one of a pair of states , and bob seeks to guess which state this was .",
    "thus , he seeks to maximize his information gain , specifically , his probability of correctly estimating the state that alice submitted . on the other hand , in the protocols where bob is required to return a quantum system to alice",
    "whenever he guesses correctly , he is faced with a different task : to gain information while avoiding , as best as possible , having alice detect this fact .",
    "specifically , bob seeks to maximize his probability of correctly estimating the state and passing alice s test .",
    "we call this task _ state spying _ because the job of a spy is not simply to gain information , but to do so without the adversary being aware of this fact .",
    "the simplest version of the state spying task proceeds as follows :    alice submits a system in some state , called the prepared state , to bob .",
    "bob implements a measurement on the system(possibly trivial ) and forms an estimate of the prepared state , called the guessed state .",
    "bob announces the guessed state .",
    "bob returns the system to alice , and alice performs a pass / fail test for the prepared state .",
    "the possible outcomes are :    bob announces the prepared state and passes alice s test    bob announces the prepared state and fails alice s test    bob announces a non - prepared state and passes alice s test    bob announces a non - prepared state and fails alice s test in state spying , `` success '' is to achieve outcome ( a ) . pursuing the spying metaphor , we call the probability of achieving outcome   ( a ) the _ intelligence_. another probability that is of interest is the probability of failing alice s test , i.e. the sum of the probabilities of outcomes ( b ) or ( d ) .",
    "we call this the _ disturbance . _    in the introduction",
    ", we provided a brief description of how state spying is similar to state targeting .",
    "the analogy is clearer if one compares the above definition of state spying with the definition of state targeting provided in section [ motivating ] .",
    "moreover , just as it is useful for security analyses of two - party protocols to determine the maximal control , the maximum disturbance - free control and the optimal control - disturbance trade - off , so too is it useful to determine the maximum intelligence , the maximum disturbance - free intelligence , and the optimal intelligence - disturbance trade - off .    for pure states ,",
    "the maximum probability of success in disturbance - free state spying is equal to the maximum probability of success in error - free state discrimination , since someone who has achieved success in an error - free discrimination procedure knows the identity of the prepared state , and consequently can always re - prepare the state and pass a test for it with certainty .",
    "mixed states can be incorporated into the notion of state spying in exactly the same manner in which they are incorporated into state targeting .",
    "as we have shown , a test for a purification of a mixed state is the most difficult test to pass , and consequently is the most interesting test to consider . in this case",
    ", the system that alice submits to bob will be entangled with one that remains in her possession .",
    "because of this entanglement , successful error - free state discrimination does not imply successful disturbance - free state spying .",
    "although it is possible to achieve error - free discrimination of mixed states with some probability @xcite , having classical knowledge of which mixed state was prepared is insufficient to re - prepare a purification of that state .",
    "there are clearly many interesting questions that remain to be answered about the task of state spying .",
    "it is obvious that the security analyses of the wcf protocols we have presented throughout the paper require determining the optimal degree of success that can be achieved in a variety of state targeting tasks .",
    "this is also true for the security analysis of protocols for other two - party cryptographic tasks such as strong coin flipping @xcite , partially binding and partially concealing bit commitment @xcite , and bit escrow @xcite .",
    "_ quantum _ two - party protocols are especially significant because in classical information theory there are no two - party protocols which offer information - theoretic security , that is , security which relies on the laws of physics rather than on computational intractability assumptions . in the quantum context , there exist two - party protocols that can guarantee to each party that if they follow the honest protocol , their opponent can not bias the outcome against them more than a certain amount @xcite .",
    "moreover , there exist quantum protocols that can guarantee to each party that if their opponent cheats , then there will be a non - zero probability of detecting this fact@xcite .",
    "we call these two types of security _ bias - resistance _ and _ cheat - sensitivity _ respectively .",
    "our results have bearing on both .",
    "specifically , the maximum control specifies the degree of bias - resistance , while the maximum disturbance - free control , and the optimal control - disturbance trade - off specify the degree of cheat - sensitivity that is offered by a protocol .",
    "the problem we have considered here can be generalized in many ways .",
    "first , one could consider the case where the prior probabilities of different states being the target state are unequal .",
    "most of our results are easily generalized to this case .",
    "second , one could consider different sorts of tests , in particular , tests that are not associated one - to - one with states , in the sense that such a test could be passed with certainty by more than one state .",
    "for instance , one could consider support tests and convex decomposition tests for mixed states ( defined in section [ tests ] ) .",
    "some results on the degree of control that can be achieved in state targeting for convex decomposition tests can be found in refs .",
    "finally , one could imagine that the target state ( or target test ) could be chosen from a set of states ( tests ) with more than two elements .",
    "answering such questions will shed light on whether various existing protocols for two - party cryptographic tasks can be improved by modifying the sort of state targeting that is faced by a cheater .",
    "we have presented an introduction to a quantum information theoretic primitive we term _",
    "state targeting_. we have argued that this is a primitive task in quantum information , in the same sense that _ state estimation _ is a primitive task .",
    "indeed , we have shown that state targeting has a natural dual in the context of state estimation , namely , the task of _ state spying _ , which occurs when the estimator is interested in gaining information about a system while minimizing the disturbance that this entails .",
    "we have solved a variety of optimization problems associated with state targeting . in the process , we have derived a generalization of uhlmann s theorem and have shown how the fidelity can arise in a natural operational context .",
    "we end by identifying which aspects of state targeting can be deemed truly quantum .",
    "if one adopts the view that quantum states are states of knowledge , rather than physical states @xcite , what is analogous to a quantum state in classical mechanics is a probability distribution , and what is analogous to non - orthogonality of quantum states is non - disjointness of probability distributions , where two distributions are non - disjoint if there exists a non - empty subset of the physical state space to which they both assign non - zero probability .",
    "a pair of non - disjoint distributions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ liouvillestates ] .    by the lights of this analogy",
    ", the task of state estimation has a natural classical analogue .",
    "specifically , the task of correctly identifying which of a non - orthogonal pair of quantum states describes a system is analogous to the task of correctly identifying which of a non - disjoint pair of probability distributions describes a classical system , that is , of identifying whether the system was prepared by drawing its physical state at random from one or another of a pair of non - disjoint probability distributions . just as the quantum discrimination task can not be accomplished with certainty , neither can this classical discrimination task .",
    "the reason is that the physical state of the system has some probability of lying in the overlap of the two probability distributions ( the region @xmath161 in fig .",
    "[ liouvillestates ] ) , and this is consistent with both preparations .",
    "thus , even a measurement that completely determined the physical state of the system could not reveal which preparation was implemented .",
    "nonetheless , just as in quantum mechanics , there is a probability greater than 1/2 of a correct estimation , and a non - zero probability of error - free discrimination .",
    "specifically , if one measures the physical state of the system , and finds it in the region outside the overlap of the distributions ( outside of @xmath161 ) , then one knows with certainty which distribution describes the system .",
    "similarly , there is a classical analogue for the task of state targeting .",
    "the target quantum state is replaced by a target probability distribution .",
    "alice submits a system to bob , then learns the identity of the target distribution , announces a distribution to bob , and bob tests the submitted system for being described by the announced distribution .",
    "the simplest way for bob to test for a distribution is to test the system for being in the support of the distribution , that is , for being in the subset of the physical state space that is assigned non - zero probability by the distribution .",
    "for instance , one tests for @xmath162 by verifying whether @xmath128 lies in region @xmath163 , depicted in fig .",
    "[ liouvillestates ] .",
    "it is now clear that alice can achieve some non - trivial control .",
    "for instance , if she initially submits a system prepared according to @xmath164 , but the target distribution is @xmath165 , then she still has some probability of passing a test for @xmath165 . specifically , her probability is the integral of @xmath164 in the region @xmath161 .    for both state estimation and state targeting",
    ", there are differences between what can be achieved in the quantum and the classical contexts .    in the case of estimation of classical probability distributions",
    ", one does not necessarily alter the probability distribution by acquiring information about it , and thus one does not alter the probability of passing subsequent tests . for instance , if the distribution is @xmath162 , then the fact that someone measures whether @xmath128 is in the interval @xmath166 or not does not change the fact that the system will be found in the interval @xmath163 when tested . on the other hand , gaining information about which of a pair of non - orthogonal states describes a quantum system _ does _ influence the probability that this system will subsequently pass a test for the state in which it was initially prepared .    in the case of classical distribution targeting ,",
    "there is a strategy that allows one to pass the test for the target state with certainty .",
    "for instance , if the target distribution is one of @xmath164 or @xmath165 , then alice can simply prepare the system in a physical state @xmath167 and be certain to pass both the test for @xmath164 ( being in the interval @xmath166 ) and the test for @xmath165 ( being in the interval @xmath168 ) .",
    "one can say that alice achieves _",
    "complete control _ in this case . on the other hand , in the quantum case ,",
    "such complete control is not possible because no quantum state can pass the test for each of two non - orthogonal pure states with certainty .",
    "thus , if one takes the view that quantum states are states of knowledge , what is surprising about quantum state estimation is not that one can not achieve an error - free discrimination of non - orthogonal states with certainty but rather that one can not gain information without incurring a disturbance .",
    "similarly , what is surprising about quantum state targeting is not the possibility of achieving a non - trivial control , but rather the impossibility of achieving complete control , that is , the impossibility of achieving successful state targeting with probability 1 , since this is what one would expect from examining the analogous classical task .    recognizing this difference between the classical and quantum tasks is likely to be useful in devising quantum information processing protocols that are provably superior to their classical counterparts .    c. h. bennett and g. brassard , in _ proc .",
