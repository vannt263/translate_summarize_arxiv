    "sno detects electrons and neutrons from , respectively , charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) interactions of neutrinos on deuterons , as well as neutrino - electron elastic scattering ( es ) interactions , in one kilotonne of d@xmath7o contained in a 12  m diameter acrylic vessel ( av ) .",
    "these interactions are observed via cherenkov light detected by 9456 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) mounted on a 17.8  m diameter support structure . by comparing the observed rates of these interactions",
    ", sno has demonstrated that a substantial fraction of the @xmath8b electron neutrinos produced in the sun transform into other active neutrino flavors  ( @xcite ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the predictions of neutrino oscillations  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sun generates energy by nuclear fusion ; protons combine to form helium in reactions that release neutrinos .",
    "the primary solar fusion process is a series of reactions known as the pp chain .",
    "five reactions in the pp chain produce neutrinos ; the highest energy neutrinos are those from the _ hep _ reaction : @xmath9he + p @xmath10 @xmath11he + e@xmath12 + @xmath5 .",
    "the endpoint of the _ hep _ neutrino spectrum is 18.77  mev and lies above that of the @xmath8b spectrum , which is approximately 15  mev .",
    "the flux of _ hep _ neutrinos ( _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) is currently predicted to be @xmath13  @xmath2s@xmath3  ( @xcite ) , which is small compared to the fluxes from the other neutrino - producing reactions in the pp chain , including the @xmath8b flux which has been measured to be @xmath14  @xmath2s@xmath3  ( @xcite ) . the dominant contribution to the uncertainty in the _ hep _",
    "neutrino flux prediction is @xmath15 from the calculation of the nuclear matrix elements  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the previous best upper limit on the _ hep _ neutrino flux is @xmath16  @xmath2s@xmath3 at the @xmath17 confidence level ( cl ) , based on measurements with the super - kamiokande detector  ( @xcite ) . after accounting for neutrino oscillations ,",
    "this limit can be interpreted as an upper bound on the total flux of _ hep _ neutrinos of @xmath18  @xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "currently , only one reaction ( @xmath8b ) from the pp chain has been uniquely observed and measured experimentally .",
    "an observation of _ hep _ neutrinos would give further confirmation of the pp chain as the primary solar energy generation mechanism and would allow further tests of the solar model .",
    "neutrinos produced in core - collapse supernovae also contribute to the energy region above the @xmath8b endpoint .",
    "the current generation of neutrino detectors can detect the transient signal from a supernova in the milky way , but the expected signal from a supernova in a more distant galaxy is fewer than one event .",
    "neutrinos from all extragalactic supernovae since the beginning of the formation of stars in the universe constitute the diffuse supernova neutrino background ( dsnb ) , which may be detectable .",
    "model predictions range from 0.19 to 1.49  @xmath2s@xmath3 for the @xmath5 component of the dsnb flux in the neutrino energy range 22.9  mev @xmath6 36.9  mev ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the best upper limit on the @xmath19 component of the dsnb flux is 1.2  @xmath2s@xmath3 at the 90@xmath4 cl for @xmath20  mev , based on measurements with the super - kamiokande detector  ( @xcite ) .",
    "while an indirect limit on the @xmath5 component of the dsnb flux can be inferred from this ( @xcite ) , the previous best direct upper limit is @xmath21  @xmath2s@xmath3 for neutrino energies 25  mev @xmath6 50  mev , based on measurements with the mont blanc liquid scintillator detector  ( @xcite ) .    a search for _ hep _ and dsnb neutrinos has been performed by counting the numbers of events in predefined energy intervals ( signal boxes ) above the @xmath8b endpoint .",
    "the most sensitive signal boxes for this analysis were selected by evaluating the predicted signal and background levels before examining the data . given the predicted signal and background levels in the signal boxes , limits on the flux of _ hep _ and dsnb neutrinos are set using a modified feldman - cousins technique .",
    "the following sections describe the data set , detector response , determination of the backgrounds , analysis procedures and the limits obtained for the _ hep _ and dsnb neutrino fluxes .",
    "the data included in these analyses were collected during the initial phase of sno operation , during which the detector contained pure d@xmath7o .",
    "the data were collected from 1999 november 2 until 2001 may 28 and comprise 306.4 live days corresponding to an exposure of 0.65 kilotonne - years  ( @xcite ) .",
    "since results from this phase were last published , numerous improvements have been made to the analysis tools , many of which were used in the analysis of data from phase two  ( @xcite ) , for which two tonnes of salt were dissolved in the heavy water .",
    "further improvements were applied in this analysis , the most significant of which was improved estimation of the effective electron kinetic energies ( @xmath22 ) of the events , based on the optical paths to each operational pmt .",
    "other enhancements include improved handling of false hits due to cross - talk between electronics channels and an improved accounting of working pmts using both neutrino and calibration data to track bad channels .",
    "however , the vertex reconstruction algorithm was the same as that used in previous phase one analyses , in which events were reconstructed under the assumption that they are due to single electrons .",
    "this is more suited for the reconstruction of _ hep _ and dsnb events than the algorithm used in phase two .",
    "after the application of the new analysis tools , events inside the kinetic energy window of 12  mev @xmath0 35  mev were not examined until the _ hep _ and dsnb signal boxes had been selected .",
    "in addition to the event selection discussed in  @xcite , which includes a selection that removes michel electrons with visible precursors , selection criteria were applied to remove backgrounds from atmospheric neutrino interactions . as the _ hep _ and",
    "dsnb signals are expected to be single electron events , these backgrounds can be reduced significantly by removing events which correlate in time with neutrons , electrons or @xmath23-rays . consequently , any candidate event that appeared within 250  ms of another with @xmath24  mev and a reconstructed vertex inside the av was removed .",
    "in addition , two kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) tests were applied : one to test the azimuthal symmetry of the pmt hits about the reconstructed event direction ; the other to test the compatibility of the angular distribution of pmt hits with that expected from a single electron . in the signal boxes , the selections on pmt hit isotropy and the prompt light fraction",
    "were further tightened with respect to previous sno analyses ( @xcite ) .",
    "this was possible in this analysis due to the higher energies of the candidate events .",
    "the combined event selection reduced the expected number of atmospheric neutrino events in the _ hep _ signal box by a factor of 29 and by a factor of 77 in the dsnb signal box .",
    "the signal acceptance of the combined event selection is @xmath25 for _ hep _ and @xmath26 for dsnb events , measured using calibration source data and simulation .",
    "to understand the signals and backgrounds in this analysis , it is important to measure the energy response and uncertainties in the signal boxes",
    ". the energy response can be parameterized by a gaussian of resolution @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the true kinetic energy of the electron . in sno analyses ,",
    "monte carlo simulation is used to estimate the response of the detector to different particles .",
    "the propagation of electrons , positrons and @xmath23-rays is carried out using egs4  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the energy scale and resolution of the sno detector have typically been measured using 6.13  mev @xmath23-rays from a @xmath29n source  ( @xcite ) . at the higher energies more characteristic of this analysis , michel electrons from muon",
    "decays and a pt ( @xmath9h(p,@xmath23)@xmath11he ) source ( @xcite ) , which produces 19.8  mev @xmath23-rays , were used to complement the @xmath29n measurements .",
    "using simple event selection criteria , including one based on the time between events , 135 michel electrons were identified in the data .",
    "potential deviations in energy scale and energy resolution between data and simulations were assumed to be linear functions of energy .",
    "these functions were fit with a maximum likelihood technique using data from @xmath29n and pt sources as further constraints .",
    "the results were used to refine the energy scale and resolution estimates and to measure their uncertainties at the analysis thresholds .",
    "an energy scale uncertainty of @xmath30 and a resolution uncertainty of @xmath31 were estimated at the _ hep _ threshold of 14.3  mev . at the dsnb threshold of 21  mev , an energy scale uncertainty of @xmath32 and",
    "a resolution uncertainty of @xmath33 were estimated .",
    "correlations between these quantities were included in the final analysis .",
    "additional non - gaussian tails to the resolution function were also considered , but were found to be insignificant .",

    "the position resolution at 15  mev is @xmath34  cm and the angular resolution is ( @xmath35 . these were measured using a combination of @xmath29n source data and simulation .",
    "the same fiducial volume , defined by events reconstructed within a distance of 550  cm from the center of the detector , was selected .",
    "the uncertainty on the expected number of events within the fiducial volume due to vertex accuracy was @xmath36 .",
    "three distinct classes of background are considered : @xmath8b neutrino interactions , atmospheric neutrino interactions and instrumental backgrounds .",
    "figure  [ fig : hep_ene_pdfs ] shows the simulated energy spectra of the signals and backgrounds , normalized to their expected rates .",
    "the simulated effective electron kinetic energy spectra of the signals and backgrounds of interest in the _ hep _ and dsnb analyses . also shown are the data in the range 6  mev @xmath0 12  mev which are used to normalize the @xmath8b electron and neutron distributions .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino background is made up of a number of different signals : neutrons at low energies ; @xmath23-rays from nuclear de - excitations at intermediate energies ; and michel electrons and cc interactions of atmospheric @xmath5 and @xmath37 on deuterons at higher energies .",
    "the dsnb model in this figure is the @xmath38  mev model from  @xcite .",
    "the third class of background , instrumental backgrounds , which is not shown in this figure is negligible.,width=316 ]    electrons from @xmath8b neutrino interactions are the dominant ( 97@xmath4 ) background for the _ hep _ analysis but are a negligible background for dsnb .",
    "these events can reconstruct into the _ hep _ signal box due to the finite energy resolution of the detector .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath8b background depends on the details of the detector response and is very sensitive to the energy scale and resolution at threshold . in the cc interaction ,",
    "by which sno predominantly detects the @xmath8b and _ hep _ neutrinos , there is a strong correlation between neutrino and electron energy .",
    "this , in addition to a cross section that rises with the square of the energy rather than linearly , provides a clearer distinction between the two neutrino spectra in the region of the @xmath8b endpoint than is possible with the es interaction .",
    "the @xmath8b background also depends on the details of the shape of the detected electron spectrum .",
    "the @xmath8b neutrino spectrum from  @xcite was assumed along with its quoted uncertainties .",
    "neutrino oscillations were taken into account by correcting and combining the electron spectra from cc and es interactions using the energy - dependent @xmath5 survival probability from the joint solar neutrino and kamland ( @xcite ) oscillation analysis presented in  @xcite .",
    "additional spectral adjustments were included to account for cc interactions on @xmath39o , radiative corrections to the cc deuteron cross section  ( @xcite ) and the acceptance of the event selection .",
    "the expectation for the hep signal is constructed in the same way using the neutrino spectrum from @xcite with corrections from @xcite .    after the determination of the @xmath8b signal shape , its normalization was determined using data at lower energies , where the _ hep _ signal is insignificant . in an energy window of 6  mev @xmath0 12  mev , 2006 events were observed . to determine normalizations , these data were fit using a maximum likelihood technique with probability density functions ( pdfs ) for the @xmath8b electrons ( cc and es signals ) and neutrons ( nc signal and background ) .",
    "the distributions used in this fit were functions of event energy and direction with respect to the sun ( @xmath40 ) . the results of this fit were then used to estimate the @xmath8b contribution inside the signal boxes .",
    "atmospheric neutrino interactions produce a second class of background events .",
    "they are the dominant background in the dsnb signal box and come from several sources :    * electrons from low energy ( @xmath41 100  mev ) charged - current @xmath5 and @xmath42 interactions ; * michel electron events , where the precursor muons ( and pions ) are below the cherenkov threshold and do not trigger the detector ; * 15.1  mev @xmath23-rays from de - excitation of an excited state of @xmath43c created via a nuclear cascade from neutrino interactions on @xmath29o ; * mis - identified non - electron events .    for low energy atmospheric @xmath5 and @xmath42 , the flux prediction from  @xcite",
    "is used , which has an uncertainty of @xmath44 .",
    "only charged current interactions on deuterons , with cross sections from  @xcite and  @xcite are considered ; the contributions from other interaction types are not significant .",
    "the interactions of these neutrinos constitute @xmath45 of the dsnb background , but are insignificant in the _ hep _ signal box .",
    "events from the latter three sources are associated with atmospheric neutrinos of higher energy ( @xmath46 100  mev ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations were used to generate atmospheric neutrino interactions in the sno detector with statistics equivalent to 500 times the expected number of events .",
    "for this purpose , the package nuance  ( @xcite ) was used , with the bartol04 flux prediction for sudbury  ( @xcite ) . the flux uncertainty in the neutrino energy range that contributes to the background is @xmath47 .",
    "the events generated by nuance were then propagated and fully simulated in the sno monte carlo , from which background predictions were obtained after application of the event selection .",
    "to assess uncertainties these events were divided into three categories . the first category , @xmath48 quasi - elastic ( qe ) cc events , is the primary source of untagged michel electrons and originates from neutrinos in the energy range 150 to 250  mev .",
    "the uncertainty on the cross section in this energy region is @xmath44  ( @xcite ) .",
    "these michel electrons comprise 80@xmath4 of the dsnb background .",
    "for the second category , 15.1  mev @xmath23-ray events , there is no data in the literature on production rates and , thus , a 100@xmath4 uncertainty was assigned to the production rate predicted by nuance , which uses the calculation of @xcite .",
    "these @xmath23-rays constitute half of the atmospheric background in the _ hep _ analysis , but due to the magnitude of the @xmath8b background constitute only 1.5@xmath4 of the total _ hep _ background .",
    "the final category comprises qe nc events and interactions that produce pions , to which a cross section uncertainty of @xmath49 is assigned  ( @xcite ) .    there is an additional uncertainty applicable to the latter two categories of atmospheric neutrino interactions . a comparison of events from data and the simulation has shown that the simulation underestimates the production of correlated neutrons .",
    "it is unclear if this is due to errors in the prediction of primary neutron production or in the transport of hadrons in the simulation .",
    "however , there is good agreement between data and monte carlo for correlated electron events .",
    "events in the simulation are re - weighted in such a way that the average neutron multiplicity is changed to better match the data .",
    "this results in a change to the background rejection rate in the simulation due to time correlated neutrons .",
    "this correction results in an additional uncertainty of @xmath50 in the rate of atmospheric background events inside the signal box that are not due to qe cc interactions .",
    "after application of the event selection to remove events with correlated neutrons , electrons and gamma - rays the atmospheric background in these analyses is reduced by a factor of two .    to verify the predictions for the atmospheric neutrino background , data outside the signal box in the energy range 35  mev @xmath0 55  mev were examined .",
    "this energy range was selected to be most sensitive to the main component of the atmospheric neutrino background : the michel electrons . in this energy range , 0.28 michel electrons and 0.05 electrons from low energy",
    "charged - current atmospheric neutrino interactions are expected .",
    "one event was observed , consistent with the predictions of the simulation . inside this energy range ,",
    "the effect of the event selection on events correlated with neutrons , electrons or @xmath23-rays was also examined .",
    "two such events were observed , each consistent with being an otherwise untagged michel electron preceded by a @xmath23-ray from the de - excitation of the nucleus participating in the primary neutrino interaction .",
    "no events were observed that are correlated with neutron or electron events .",
    "these results are also consistent with the predictions of the simulation .",
    "the final class of backgrounds is associated with instrumental effects such as electronic pickup or static discharge from the pmts . for these events ,",
    "an upper limit of 0.002 events is set in an energy range of 6  mev @xmath0 35  mev using the technique described in  @xcite .",
    "this analysis is not sensitive to the isotropic acrylic vessel background ( iavb ) ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "to predict the number of iavb events that pass the signal event selection , the 13 iavb events clearly identified in the data by simple criteria are scaled via monte carlo simulation .",
    "a limit of @xmath51 iavb events in the energy range of 14  mev @xmath0 35  mev is inferred at the @xmath17 cl .",
    "the analysis was designed to construct confidence intervals on the neutrino fluxes using a modified feldman - cousins approach  ( @xcite ) .",
