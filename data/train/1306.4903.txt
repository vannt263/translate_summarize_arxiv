    "the process of spontaneous parametric downconversion ( spdc )  @xcite has been used for the generation of paired photons in many recent experiments , ranging from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics  @xcite to implementations of quantum information processing protocols  @xcite . in this process a laser pump beam illuminates a second - order non - linear crystal , where individual pump photons are annihilated giving rise to the emission of signal and idler photon pairs . in particular , these photon pairs exhibit a rich transverse spatial structure  @xcite , which forms the subject matter of the present study .",
    "photon pairs entangled in the spatial degree of freedom , including the specific case of entanglement in orbital angular momentum  @xcite , are of interest because each photon can be described by a multi - dimensional hilbert space  @xcite compared to the case of polarization which is limited to a dimension of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "spatially - resolved single - photon detection in the transverse momentum domain yields the angular spectrum ( as ) of the spdc bi - photon field , which for type - i spdc has a well - known annular shape .",
    "if a single photon is detected at a certain location in the as with transverse momentum value @xmath1 , the conjugate photon can be detected in coincidence around the location which fulfills transverse momentum conservation , i.e. with transverse momentum value @xmath2 .",
    "this forms the basis for a second measurement of interest , in which the idler photon is detected at a certain transverse momentum value and where spatially - resolved coincidence detection of the signal photon yields the _ conditional _ angular spectrum ( cas ) , which may be thought of as the shape of the heralded signal - mode photon  @xcite .",
    "an idealized plane - wave pump in the process of spdc leads to strict transverse momentum correlations , so that each individual idler - mode @xmath3-vector in the as is correlated to a single signal - mode @xmath3-vector , yielding a delta - like cas . in contrast , for a realistic experimental situation involving finite transverse dimensions of the pump beam , these transverse momentum correlations are no longer strict , i.e. each individual idler - mode @xmath3-vector is correlated with a _",
    "spread _ of signal - mode @xmath3-vectors , so that the cas acquires a certain width .",
    "the properties of spatially - entangled spdc photon pairs , including the as and cas , are determined on the one hand by the transverse electric field distribution of the pump , and on the other hand by the nonlinear crystal properties , including crystal dispersion , length and poynting vector walk off .",
    "the manner in which the pump transverse spatial properties are mapped to those of the spdc photon pairs has been studied in a number of papers  @xcite .",
    "it is known that for a sufficiently short crystal , the spatially - resolved rate of signal - idler coincidences is fully determined by the pump transverse electric field distribution  @xcite . within this limit",
    ", it thus becomes straightforward to engineer photon pairs to have a particular spatial character , as determined by the pump .",
    "this forms the basis for a large body of work , which seeks to exploit particular types of spatial correlations present in spdc photon pairs .",
    "indeed , the short - crystal approximation has been used in the context of the implementation of quantum information processing protocols , in experiments which exploit the orbital angular momentum of spdc photon pairs  @xcite , in ghost imaging and diffraction experiments  @xcite , as well as in a variety of other recent experiments  @xcite . however , for a sufficiently long crystal or for a sufficiently focused pump beam , the photon pair properties are no longer solely determined by the pump spatial distribution .",
    "the objective of this paper is to provide an understanding of the spdc photon - pair properties in general , including situations for which the short - crystal approximation can and can not be used , as well as of the boundary between these two regimes .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of the cas and of how the as properties are derived from those of the cas , paying special attention to crystal length effects .",
    "we show that the cas is given by the product of two separate functions , one which is related to the pump as , and another one which is related to the properties of the nonlinear crystal , including length , dispersion and poynting vector walkoff . in our study of crystal length effects , we show that a critical length @xmath4 exists , which depends on the degree of pump focusing , so that for @xmath5 , crystal length effects can be neglected , and the cas is fully determined by the pump as ; we show that in this case the cas is a displaced version of the pump as .",
    "we also show that for @xmath6 , the cas is determined both by the pump as and the crystal properties . in this latter case , we show that the cas becomes elongated to a degree related to the crystal length and tilted according to the location of the fixed detector , leading to azimuthal distinguishability .",
    "we have carried out experimental measurements of the as and cas , exhibiting excellent agreement with numerical simulations based on our spdc theory , which is general enough to include essentially all experimental aspects of interest , i.e an arbitrary pump spatial distribution , spatial and spectral filtering of the spdc photons , crystal dispersion , poynting vector walkoff , and the spatial extent of detectors . in particular , we have performed a careful experimental / numerical exploration of the as and of the cas , where we vary the degree of pump focusing  @xcite in order to explore and contrast the resulting behavior in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 regimes . our theory presented here explains the azimuthal distinguishability evident in the cas measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite , making it clear that this distinguishability is a crystal - length effect which appears only for sufficiently long crystals ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "this paper leads to a quantitative and qualitative understanding , not available in previous works , of how the spatial character of spdc photon pairs is determined by nonlinear crystal properties in addition to the pump angular spectrum , which should be useful for the design of photon pair sources for specific applications .",

    "we are interested in studying the transverse spatial structure of the emitted photon pairs , specifically through spatially - resolved photon counting experiments .",
    "standard fourier optics techniques may be used in order to probe this structure in either the transverse position , or the transverse wavevector momentum domains .",
    "specifically , a map of counts as a function of the signal- and idler - mode transverse wavevector may be obtained by a detection scheme with transverse spatial resolution on the fourier plane located a distance of one focal length @xmath37 from a lens of focal length @xmath37 , itself placed a distance @xmath37 from the spdc crystal . if two detectors are placed on the fourier plane so that they collect photons with transverse wavevectors @xmath38 and @xmath39 and frequencies @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the rate of signal and idler coincidences is given by    @xmath42 , and @xmath43 may be replaced by @xmath44 . assuming detectors with ideal transverse wavevector resolution , and integrating over the spectral content of the photon pairs , it may be shown that the rate of coincidences can then be written as follows    @xmath45    thus , the rate of coincidences can be factored into two contributions . on the one hand ,",
    "@xmath46 is related to transverse phasematching and is fully determined by the pump angular spectrum . on the other hand , @xmath47 is related to longitudinal phasematching and is determined by the crystal , including the effects of the crystal length , dispersion and poynting vector walkoff .",

    "let us consider the limit in which the pump beam is in the form of a plane wave , with transverse wavevector @xmath52 .",
    "in this case , the function @xmath53 becomes    @xmath54    this equation tells us that if a single idler photon is detected at @xmath55 , the conjugate photons may be found at @xmath56 so that transverse momentum is exactly conserved .",
    "note , however , that the probability of observing photon pairs at two such conjugate points is limited by the function @xmath57 , i.e. by the existence of longitudinal phasematching at these two transverse wavevector values .",
    "let us now consider the more general case where the pump is given by a superposition of plane waves , i.e. for which the pump as is no longer a delta function . in this case ,",
    "if a single photon is detected at @xmath55 on the transverse wavevector space , the conjugate photons may be found _ around _",
    "@xmath58 with an uncertainty which grows with the width of the pump angular spectrum .",
    "we then refer to the function @xmath59 , which determines this uncertainty , as the conditional angular spectrum ( cas ) of the signal photon , conditioned on the detection of a single idler photon with transverse wavevector @xmath60 .",
    "the function @xmath61 , which for a sufficiently broad @xmath62 represents the signal - photon cas , is a displaced version of the pump as , centered at @xmath63 .",
    "specifically , let us consider the case where the pump beam is in the form of a gaussian beam with widths @xmath64 and @xmath65 along the @xmath66 and @xmath67 directions . in this case",
    ", @xmath53 is given by    @xmath68    in terms of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 components of the vector @xmath30 .",
    "as the pump beam is increasingly focused , corresponding to smaller values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the pump as becomes broader also leading to a broader cas , as limited by the function @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the strict one - to - one transverse momentum signal and idler correlations which appear in the plane - wave pump limit become weaker as the pump is increasingly focused .",
    "so far we have considered idealized detection of the signal and idler modes involving a single transverse wavevector value . however , in a realistic experimental implementation , the transverse dimensions of the detectors used for the signal and idler modes are non - vanishing .",
    "suppose that the transverse wavevector acceptance of each detector is characterized by functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the signal and idler modes respectively , where each of the detectors is centered at @xmath72 ( with @xmath12 ) .",
    "then , the resulting coincidence rate obtained with these detectors can be written as    @xmath73    let us now turn our attention to single - channel counts , i.e. obtained through a single detector .",
    "the rate of single - channel counts obtained by a detector placed so that it selects single photons with transverse wavevector @xmath38 and frequency @xmath40 , is given by @xmath74 was derived , the rate of single - channel detection is related to the cas through the following simple relationship    @xmath75    the above quantity represents the transverse - wavevector distribution , or angular spectrum ( as ) , of the spdc photon pairs .",

    "[ e : as : pr ] , which show this annular structure , and how it differs in the two regimes of interest , namely those for which the short - crystal approximation can and can not be used .    in the case of a non - ideal detector characterized by an acceptance function @xmath70",
    ", the signal - mode angular spectrum may be written as    @xmath80    for the discussion of the experimental results , below , it is useful to consider the single - channel and double - channel detection rates as a function of the transverse coordinates on the fourier plane , behind an @xmath37-@xmath37 optical system , i.e. @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "if the signal and idler modes each involve a single emission frequency , then these functions are simply scaled versions of their counterparts in the wavevector domain , according to the transformation @xmath83 \\bm{\\rho}^\\bot_\\mu$ ] ( with @xmath12 ) , where @xmath37 is the focal length used in the @xmath37-@xmath37 optical system , i.e. each transverse position on the fourier plane corresponds to a specific transverse momentum value .",
    "however , because this transformation is frequency - dependent , if the emitted modes contain a spread of frequencies the rate of single - channel detection in the position and wavevector domains are not simply scaled versions of each other . when carrying out simulations , care must be taken to integrate the functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 over the detected spectral components .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : geometry ] we show the geometry of the spdc emission annulus for non - collinear type - i spdc from a negative uniaxial , specifically beta barium borate ( bbo ) , crystal .",
    "we denote by @xmath84 the wavevector corresponding to the central direction of propagation of the pump beam , by @xmath85 the pump poynting vector , and by @xmath86 the crystal axis .",
    "note that the angular separation between @xmath85 and @xmath84 is due to poynting vector walkoff .",
    "we also show two pairs of signal and idler rays born at two distinct planes , projected on the @xmath67-@xmath87 and @xmath66-@xmath87 planes . as may be appreciated in the figure , because photon pairs are born along the path of @xmath85 , on the @xmath67-@xmath87 plane the two upper rays have a greater separation from @xmath85 compared to the two lower rays , while the two corresponding separations are equal on the @xmath66-@xmath87 plane .",
    "this leads to an asymmetry in the emission annulus .",
    "note that while for the above argument , we have implicitly assumed a transversely well - localized pump beam , the pump beam in fact has horizontal and vertical widths @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "if these widths are considerably larger that the lateral ray displacement @xmath88 , the annulus asymmetry is in fact suppressed . in other words , this asymmetry is visible only for a sufficiently focused beam so that @xmath89 .",
    "note that this asymmetry , mediated by pump focusing and poynting vector walkoff , is the origin of so called `` hot spots '' which have been observed in the spatial flux distribution of type - ii parametric downconversion  @xcite .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxspdc ] we show simulations of the as for the case of a gaussian beam pump , based on numerical integration of eqns .  [",
    "e : cas : pr ] and [ e : as : pr ] .",
    "the as is shown as a contour plot for two different degrees of focusing ( @xmath90 m , @xmath91 m for panel a and @xmath92 m , @xmath93 m for panel b ; note that these choices of beam widths correspond to experimental situations presented below ) . for these plots",
    "we have assumed a @xmath94 mm long bbo crystal cut at @xmath95 , for non collinear type - i phasematching .",
    "note that while the annulus is symmetric , with a constant width , in the case of panel a , it becomes asymmetric with an azimuthally - varying width for panel b , as indeed is to be expected from the argument in the previous paragraph .",
    "this annulus asymmetry apparent in the single - channel counts spatial distribution also translates into azimuthal distinguishability of the photon pairs around the annulus ( i.e. into an azimuthal variation of the orientation and width of the cas )  @xcite . in order to illustrate this , in both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxspdc ] we also show the cas corresponding to @xmath96 points ( shown as white dots ) chosen to be angularly equidistant on the left - hand side of the angular spectrum . for three of these points ( top , left and bottom ) we show in addition plots of the @xmath46 and @xmath47 functions , the product of which yields the cas .",
    "note that the as asymmetry may be explained in terms of clipping of the @xmath46 function by the @xmath47 function .",
    "for example , for a fixed detector at the top of the annulus , the corresponding cas in a focused pump regime is narrowed by the horizontal structure of the @xmath47 function .",
    "thus , the as at the top of the annulus given as the integral over all @xmath39 values of the cas will have a lower value compared , say , to the diametrically opposed portion of the annulus where this clipping does not occur . as will be discussed below ,",

    "it is interesting to relate the cas in the spontaneous case which we study in this paper , to the size of speckles obtained in the spatial intensity distribution in the case of high - gain , i.e. stimulated parametric downconversion  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "spdc photons with a given transverse angular momentum @xmath101 within the as can serve as a seed for parametric amplification , leading to the appearance of coupled speckles at @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "according to the analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite , the mean speckle area ( also sometimes referred to as coherence area ) , is inversely proportional to the pump beam transverse area , an effect which mimics the observed dependence of the area in transverse momentum space of our cas on the focusing strength .",
    "note on the one hand that the function @xmath47 depends only on crystal properties ; in particular , its width is determined by the crystal length @xmath103 with longer crystals yielding narrower widths .",
    "note on the other hand that the function @xmath46 depends only on pump properties , and its width corresponds to the pump angular width , i.e. it is determined by the degree of pump focusing .",
    "thus , for a given degree of pump focusing there is a critical crystal length @xmath4 such that for @xmath104 the function @xmath47 is wider than the function @xmath46 so that the latter fully determines the cas .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath105 , the cas is determined by both of these functions together , i.e. by crystal properties in addition to pump properties .",
    "note from fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxspdc ] that a plot of the function @xmath47 yields a stripe which is horizontally - oriented at the top and bottom of the annulus , with a larger width at the top , and which is oriented diagonally at other annulus locations , with a maximum tilt at the left and right .",
    "this azimuthal variability of the function @xmath47 is the origin of the azimuthal distinguishability of photon pairs . in particular ,",
    "areas outside of the structure of function @xmath106 , which may be diagonal , are `` removed '' from the plot of function @xmath107 and can yield a narrowed and tilted cas .",
    "it is thus interesting to consider the as and cas in the short - crystal regime ( @xmath108 ) . in this limit ,",
    "the @xmath69 function is much broader than the @xmath109 function , so that the conditional angular spectrum is determined by the latter , according to    @xmath110    note that because the cas in eq .",
    "[ casshort ] depends only on the pump as , it is azimuthally invariant .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the amplitude underlying this conditional angular spectrum . in the case of ideal idler detection involving a single transverse wavevector @xmath111 and frequency @xmath112 , and within the short crystal regime",

    "note that the resulting pump beamwaist is not necessarily precisely centered with respect to the crystal ; while in our theory , the as and cas depend on the beam radii @xmath64 and @xmath65 at the beamwaist , these functions do not depend on the beamwaist location with respect to the crystal s center plane  @xcite",

    "[ e : as : pr ] ; for convenience , we have also labeled these plots with the transverse momentum values at the degenerate spdc frequency .",
    "note that because the transverse dimensions of the fiber used for photon collection is negligible compared with the width of the as annulus , in computing our numerical simulations we have used the expression corresponding to delta - like detectors on the fourier plane ( eq .

    "the third and fourth panels in each block show projected angular spectra obtained by adding together values along columns of this grid , to obtain the horizontal projected as , and likewise obtained by adding together values along rows of this grid in order to obtain the vertical projected as .",
    "we employ these projected angular spectra for a careful comparison between measurements and simulations ; note that while we could also use for this purpose a `` slice '' obtained for fixed @xmath158 ( or fixed @xmath159 ) , the projected angular spectra lead to considerably more counts per grid location , and therefore to better statistics .",
    "the continuous lines represent the corresponding numerical simulations , where the as has been integrated over the @xmath159 coordinate to obtain the horizontal projected as , and over the @xmath158 coordinate to obtain the vertical projected as . in general terms it may be seen that increasing the degree of pump focusing ( or decreasing @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) leads to an increasingly asymmetrical as , along the vertical direction , with a larger width at the top of the annulus than at its bottom ; note that , in contrast , the widths at the left and right of the annulus are comparable .",
    "as discussed above , this as asymmetry appears for parameter combinations in the regime @xmath6 .",
    "this asymmetry , which is related to poynting vector walkoff , is clear from the vertical projected as which exhibits a wider and shorter right - hand peak compared to the left - hand peak .",
    "in contrast , the horizontal projected angular spectrum is symmetric , both peaks exhibiting identical heights and widths .",

    "note that the agreement between the experimental measurements and the numerical simulations is excellent .",
    "let us now turn our attention to coincidence counts , i.e. to measurements of the _ conditional _ angular spectrum .",
    "as in the case of our measurements of the as , we have undertaken measurements for the four experimental situations from table  [ table ] .",
    "likewise , for each of these four cases we have carried out a corresponding numerical simulation .",
    "these results are shown in figure  [ fig : doubles ] , which is organized in four blocks , for each of the focusing strengths from table  [ table ] .",

    "the first panel represents a measurement of the conditional angular spectrum , shown in six gray levels , as indicated by the gray level bar on the left . for these measurements ,",
    "data was taken on a transverse position grid , located around the transverse position conjugate to the position of the idler - mode fiber .",
    "each grid point represents a particular transverse position @xmath150 of the fiber tip , which corresponds for spdc frequency @xmath40 to a transverse momentum value @xmath151 \\bm{\\rho}_{s0}^\\bot$ ] .",
    "we have used a counting period of @xmath139 seconds at each point for measurements @xmath152 , and of @xmath160 seconds at each point for measurement @xmath154 .",
    "these counting periods reflect the fact that for a greater degree of focusing , the counts become spread out over a greater transverse area , so that the level of counts at each grid point is reduced .",
    "a grid spacing of @xmath161 m is used for measurements @xmath152 and of @xmath162 m is used for measurement @xmath154 . the white frame which encompasses the region with counts represents the range of transverse positions where data was taken ; for positions outside of this frame , the coincidence counts were fixed to zero in the plots .",
    "we show the transverse dimensions of the fiber core used for photon collection through a white disk appearing near the bottom - left corner of each panel .",
    "it may be appreciated that the transverse extent of the collection fiber can be significant compared to the width of the measured cas .",
    "in contrast , note that in the case of the as ( single - channel counts ; fig  [ fig : single - channel ] ) , the transverse dimensions of the fiber may be neglected , since they are much smaller than the width of the as annulus .",
    "in fact , a white disk which represents the fiber core transverse dimensions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : single - channel ] , although it is difficult to see due to its small size .",
    "the second panel in each block represents the corresponding numerical simulation , where we have scaled the maximum number of counts to coincide with the experimentally - obtained maximum number of counts .",
    "note that for these simulations we have assumed that the spatial filter functions @xmath163 and @xmath164 are gaussian with a full width at @xmath120 of @xmath142 m .",
    "the specific simulation carried out yields @xmath165 by numerical integration of a version of eq .",
    "[ e : cas ] written in terms of transverse position ; for convenience , we have also labeled these plots with the transverse momentum values at the degenerate spdc frequency .",
    "note that because in the case of the cas the transverse width of the fiber is significant , in computing our numerical simulations , we have used eq .",
    "[ e : cas ] , which takes into account the transverse extent of detectors on the fourier plane , rather than eq .",
    "[ e : cas : pr ] which assumes delta - like detectors .",
    "note also that in the case of coincidence counts , there are no background counts ; the plots show the actual number of counts without subtracting a background level .",
    "the maximum number of coincidence counts decreases as the strength of focusing is increased so that the data is of greater quality for lower focusing strengths .",
    "the third and fourth panels in each block show projected conditional angular spectra obtained by adding together values along columns of this grid , to obtain the horizontal projected as , and likewise obtained by adding together values along rows of this grid in order to obtain the vertical projected as . as in the case of single - channel counts we employ these projected angular spectra for a careful comparison between measurements and simulations .",
    "the continuous lines represent the corresponding numerical simulations , where the angular spectrum has been integrated over the @xmath159 coordinate to obtain the horizontal projected as , and over the @xmath158 coordinate to obtain the vertical projected as .",
    "as can be appreciated , the agreement is excellent .",
    "it is clear from our experimental and numerical results that an increased level of pump focusing broadens the cas , and that for a sufficiently long crystal ( @xmath6 ) , the cas may become tilted . indeed , as expected from our theory , the cas in fact corresponds to a displaced pump angular spectrum , which for @xmath6 may become clipped by function @xmath47 and can then become tilted .",
    "thus , a greater degree of pump focusing leads to a broader pump angular spectrum , and this in turn leads to a broader cas .",
    "note that for , both , the as and cas measurements , in the case of measurement @xmath154 , i.e. the most highly focused case that we have considered , the agreement is not as optimal as for measurements @xmath152 . we have observed that despite the use of spatial filtering through a single mode fiber , for an increasing degree of focusing , the pump beam acquires additional structure and becomes progressively less gaussian .",
    "since our theory assumes a perfectly gaussian pump beam , this explains the observed slight discrepancy between theory and experiment for measurement 4 .",
    "we have presented a theoretical and experimental exploration of the joint effects of the pump transverse electric field distribution and of the non - linear crystal on the properties of photon pairs generated by spontaneous parametric downcinversion ( spdc ) .",
    "we have focused this analysis on the angular spectrum ( as ) and on the conditional angular spectrum ( cas ) of the spdc photon pairs .",
    "we have shown that the cas may be written as the product of two functions , one which is related to transverse phasematching and depends on pump properties , and another one which is related to longitudinal phasematching and depends on nonlinear crystal properties .",
    "we have shown that a critical crystal length @xmath4 exists , which depends on the degree of pump focusing , such that for @xmath5 the cas is fully determined by the pump as , and that for @xmath6 the cas is determined jointly by crystal and pump properties . for a gaussian beam pump , @xmath4 turns out to have an essentially linear relationship with the beam radius .",
    "thus , the condition @xmath131 divides the @xmath129 parameter space into two separate parameter subspaces , where @xmath5 leads to a symmetric as and to an azimuthally invariant cas , and where @xmath6 leads to an asymmetric as and to a cas which varies in width and orientation around the spdc annulus .",
    "we have also presented experimental measurements of the as and cas for photon pairs generated through type - i non - collinear spontaneous parametric downconversion .",
    "these measurements were carried out by spatially - resolved photon counting , and by coincidence spatially - resolved photon counting , respectively .",
    "we have presented experimental data for the as and cas , along with corresponding numerical simulations based on our theory , for four different experimental configurations amongst which the degree of pump focusing is varied .",
    "a comparison of our experimental measurements with our numerical simulations leads to excellent agreement .",
    "of the four experimental configurations used , two are in the regime @xmath5 , one is near @xmath131 , and one is in the regime @xmath6 .",
    "our measurements show that , as expected from our theory , pump focusing leads to an asymmetric broadening of the as , and to a broadening and tilting of the cas .",
    "physically , the broadened as is a consequence of the greater spread of pump transverse wavevectors , resulting in phasematching for a greater spread of signal and idler transverse wavevectors .",
    "this results in broadening of the conditional angular spectrum , so that each idler - mode @xmath3-vector is correlated to a spread of signal - mode @xmath3-vectors , while this correlation is one - to - one in the idealized case of a plane - wave pump .",
    "we believe that these results will lead to an enhanced quantitative and qualitative understanding of the spatial properties of type - i , non - collinear spontaneous parametric downconversion photon pairs and to an important tool for source design .",
