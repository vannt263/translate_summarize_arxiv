    "since we are exploiting the @xmath3 and @xmath4 appearance channels , the observables that we use in our numerical analysis are the number of expected electron neutrino and antineutrino events . for the central values of the already measured oscillation parameters ,",

    "<S> the sign of the atmospheric mass splitting @xmath7 with respect to the solar doublet is one of the unknowns within the neutrino sector , i.e. we do not know if the neutrino mass spectrum is normal ( @xmath14 ) or inverted ( @xmath15 ) . the best fit point for the combined analysis of solar neutrino data  @xcite together with kamland reactor data  @xcite is at @xmath16 ev@xmath17 and @xmath18 . the 90% c.l . </S>",

    "<S> the efficiencies of such a detector for @xmath5 ( @xmath26 ) identification is approximately @xmath27 and the background is typically two - thirds from electron ( anti)neutrinos in the beam produced from muon and kaon decays and one third from neutral current events faking electron neutrinos . </S>",

    "<S> the statistics at the far detector is governed by the product of three parameters : the total number of protons on target ( @xmath30 ) , the detector mass ( @xmath31 ) , and the detector efficiencies to @xmath5 ( @xmath26 ) identification ( @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we have studied the physics potential of three different experimental scenarios :    * * small : * as a first step , we consider a * `` small '' * experimental setup without a proton driver . </S>",

    "<S> * medium : * we study a possible upgrade of the * small * configuration , referred to as the * `` medium '' * experimental setup by increasing the statistical figure of merit by a * factor of five*. this statistics factor could be accomplished if the mass of the liquid argon detector is upgraded to 45 kton without a proton driver in three and a half years running in each polarity . or , equivalently , the same statistics could be achieved in the @xmath36a experiment running for four and a half years with a proton driver in each polarity ( i.e. four and a half years of neutrino and four and a half years of antineutrino data taking ) . with a proton driver </S>",
