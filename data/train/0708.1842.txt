    "recent advances in the fabrication and precise control of nanoscale electronic systems lead to an increased interest in the study of many body effects in quantum dot structures .",
    "the anderson single impurity model @xcite was extensively explored to successfully understand electronic correlations in small single , or double quantum dot structures . in general , single or double",
    "quantum dot configurations provide the ideal systems to study many body effects .",
    "for example , single dot configurations allow the realization of the kondo regime of the anderson impurity @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , double quantum dot ( dqd ) configurations provide the ideal candidate for the study of the many body effects associated to both kondo effect and rkky interaction @xcite .",
    "the connection of several quantum dots ( qd ) gives rise to remarkable phenomena due to the interplay of electron correlations and interference effects which depend on how the dots are arranged .",
    "one possible configuration is the double quantum  dot ( dqd ) system , where the dots are connected to the same leads and between them .",
    "recently , dias da silva _",
    "et al_. @xcite studied a dqd with one dot in the kondo regime and the other close to the resonance with the connecting leads .",
    "one of the most interesting results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite is the finite temperature analysis of the parallel t - shape double dot configuration with one dot disconnected from the leads ( fig .",
    "[ system ] ) using the idea of interference between resonances . in such a configuration , the active dot a",
    "is directly connected to the left and right leads and to a side dot s. they showed that when the side dot s is coupled to the leads only through the active dot a , the kondo resonance from the side dot s develops a sizable splitting even if there is no magnetic field in the system .",
    "this band filtering produced by the connected dot preserves the kondo singlet and at finite temperature the magnetic moment is completely screened .",
    "[ 0.5 ]    the calculation of system s conductance is of major interest both for single and double quantum dots configurations . for double quantum dot configurations",
    "the problem was considered extensively using different methods , however , the results presented by different authors are in agreement only partially @xcite .",
    "the system s electronic conductance is realized through the active dot a , however , the presence of the side dot s will influence the total conductance of the parallel t  shaped quantum dot system @xcite .",
    "the suppression of the system s conductance at low temperatures can be understood if two possible conduction paths are considered , a direct path through the active dot a ( @xmath0 ) and an indirect path through the side dot s ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "new features have been pointed out by takazawa _",
    "@xcite in connection with the inter  dot coupling strength @xmath2 and the values of the energies of the active dot @xmath3 and the energy of the side dot @xmath4 . for the case",
    "@xmath5 the occurrence of a non trivial suppression of the conductance was associated with a fano  like effect between two distinct channels , i.e. , the direct kondo resonance of the active dot a and the indirect resonance via both the active and side dots .",
    "an interesting feature of the system was discussed by cornaglia and grempel @xcite and by zitko and bonca @xcite using the new idea introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite known as the two - stage kondo effect , a behavior obtained for a dot in a strong magnetic field .",
    "shape dqd close to half  filling has a similar behavior for small inter  dot coupling @xmath2 , the possibility of a two - stage kondo effect leading to a nonmonotonic behavior of the conductance as function of the gate voltage and magnetic field . at large inter  dot coupling @xmath2 the magnetic moments of the two quantum dots",

    "the conductance varies monotonically at low temperature .",
    "one of the main results from @xcite is the calculation of the conductance @xmath6 in terms of the spectral density of the active dot a interacting with the side dot s. the zero temperature conductivity depends on the total number of electrons in the two dots , i.e. , the active dot a and the side dot s.    here , we present a @xmath7 k calculation for the dc conductance of the t - shaped quantum dot system",
    ". our analysis will start from a general hamiltonian describing the possible interactions in the double quantum dot system , i.e. , interactions inside each component dot , inter  dot interactions , and interactions with the reservoirs .",
    "previous results obtained by cornaglia and gempel @xcite give the system s conductance in terms of the total electron density in the system .",
    "however , as we will prove later in the paper , there are additional contributions related to the inter  dot electron ",
    "electron interaction which were not included in ref .",
    "we will also consider the system s conductance in the presence of a magnetic field whose role is to remove the spin degeneracy for the possible bound states in the active and side dots .",
    "all our calculations are performed in the @xmath7 k limit , so finite temperature effects will be neglected .",
    "the relevance of temperature effects due to the different kondo regimes can be evaluated by calculating the self energies of the electrons using the equation of motion method with an appropriate decoupling , however , the finite temperature conductance of the system will be the subject of another investigation @xcite .",

    "accordingly , the behavior of the system s conductance depends on the selection of the constituent dots and on the external applied bias .",
    "for example , in figure [ figconductance ] we plotted the value of the relative conductance , @xmath48 , as function of the relative inter dot coupling @xmath49 for various values of the relative energy level of the side dot and a fixed value of the relative energy level in the active dot .",
    "such graphic representations of the t - shape dqd conductance as function of various interaction energies in the system allow the optimal selection of the active and side dots .",
    "our plotting assumes fixed values for the energy levels inside the active and side dot .",
    "this assumption may be questionable as for many - body effects in the system the initial energy of the bound states in the two component dots will be changed ; however , in most of the real situations the corrections due to the self - energy on the value of the two bound states , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are small , and in a first approximation they can be neglected .",
    "tsvelik and wiegmann calculated the self - energy due to the coulomb interaction @xmath31 @xcite and proved that the real part of the self - energy depends linearly on frequency @xmath50 . at @xmath7 , in the fermi liquid approximation , the main contribution to the self - energy comes from the term @xmath51 and accordingly it can be neglected .",
    "[ 0.85 ] , for various values of the side dot energy level ( full line - @xmath52=@xmath53 , dashed line - @xmath52=@xmath54 , dotted line - @xmath52=@xmath55 ) and fixed energy value for the active dot ( @xmath56).,title=\"fig : \" ]    on the other hand eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) gives a direct relation between the system s self energy and the total number of electrons in the constituent dots . as a result",
    ", the conductance of the t - shape dqd system can be expressed also using the total number of electrons in the active and side dots . a straightforward calculation , which implies eqs . ( [ density ] ) and ( [ cond1 ] ) ,",

    "however , for the side dot , which is not directly connected to the leads , the changed of the bound state energy is much smaller that for the active dot , and such a dependence can be neglected .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) is an exact result which describe the dependence of the system s dc conductance on the total number of conduction electrons . from the experimental point of view",
    "the total number of electrons in the system is controlled using the applied external bias .    in the absence of an external magnetic field , when the two considered dots are unpolarized ( @xmath60=@xmath61 ) the normalized conductance @xmath62 can be written as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the total number of electrons in the active and side dots .",
    "it is easy to see that the zero temperature conductance of the t - shape dqd system vanishes when the total number of available electrons in the active and side dots is even .",
    "this result was already predicted in ref .",
    "our calculation for the system s conductance also accounts for the intra and inter dots electron  electron interactions . for a finite occupancy of the t - shape dqd system ,",
    "i.e. , integer number of electrons occupy the two possible energy levels , the correction term will cancel ( @xmath65 for @xmath43-integer ) .",
    "however , this fact is not an indication that the electron - electron interactions in the system can be neglected , the available number of electrons on the active and side dots being strongly dependent on these interactions and on the applied , external bias .",
    "a different situation occurs when the degeneracy of the active and side quantum dots is removed .",
    "for example , when a small magnetic field is applied , the t - shape dqd becomes polarized and the possible energy levels become spin dependent . in this case",
    ", the system s dc conductance becomes @xmath66\\nonumber\\\\ & & + { \\frac}{t^2}{\\delta e_s(0)}\\sin{(\\pi n)}\\cos{(\\pi m)}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 represents the system s magnetization . for any even number of electrons in the system ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 )",
    ", the magnetization value reduces to the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath69 case , i.e. , @xmath71 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the number of electrons in the system is odd , a different behavior of the magnetization should be expected , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "once again , the interaction term in the conductance will vanish for an integer number of electrons in the system .",
    "in this work we analyzed the conductance of a t - shape dqd . our main result is a generalization of the unitary rule of the single - level anderson impurity problem for the case of a t - shape dqd .",
    "the system s conductance depends on various interactions inside the component dots , and on the value of the energy levels in the active and side dots .",
    "tuning these interactions allow a direct control of the system conductance .",
    "we also presented a calculation of the system conductance in terms of the occupancy of the two possible energy levels in the active and side dots .",
    "a similar calculation was also presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , our result includes contributions related to the inter - dot interaction , @xmath2 . in the @xmath73 limit",
    "we recover the result presented in ref .",
    "additionally , we proved that such a term can be disregarded when the energy levels in the t - shape dqd system are occupied by an integer number of electrons . on the other hand , even at @xmath7 k or at small , but finite temperatures , when fluctuations are important , the occupancy of the energy levels can be non - integer , and in such situations the interaction correction to the system s conductance becomes important . the differences between our calculation and the one presented in ref .",
    "@xcite are a consequence of how the general current passing through the system was calculated .",
    "the result presented by cornaglia and grempel @xcite only accounts for the electron density in the active dot , and accordingly the conductance is calculated considering the inter - dot interaction small , the system behaving like a single dot with an electron occupancy @xmath74",
    ". such a result will be valid only in the limit @xmath75",
    ".    sweeping the gate voltage into and trough an odd valley in this model , corresponds to sweeping the energy of the active dot from above @xmath47 to below @xmath76 in the course of which the total number of electrons @xmath77 changes smoothly from @xmath78 to @xmath79 .",
    "we can obtain three different regimes for the system as function of various interaction parameters : ( i ) the  empty - orbital \" when @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; ( ii ) the  mixed - valence \" in which the number of electrons @xmath77 begin to increase due to strong charge fluctuations ; and ( iii ) the  local moment \" regime , in which the number of electrons @xmath77 approaches 1 and the local levels acts like a local spin in one of the dots , or in both",
    ". the latter regime can give rise to kondo correlations , and the system has to be studied at finite temperature .",
    "our calculation is done in the @xmath7 k limit , however it may be extended to finite temperatures , @xmath82 k. in this limit , the imaginary part of the self - energy @xmath83/t_{k}\\longrightarrow 0\\;,\\ ] ] when @xmath50=@xmath78 and the real part of the self - energy is constant .",
    "the temperature scale , @xmath84 , is set by the kondo effect and for the active dot can be calculated following the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the t - shape dqd system is a very promising quantum dot configuration , both from the fundamental physics and possible applications point of view .",
    "systems involving single or multiple quantum dots may provide many opportunities for strong interaction effects studies .",
    "also they may provide the optimal environment for the study of the kondo effect , or of the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yoshida interaction among local spins .",
