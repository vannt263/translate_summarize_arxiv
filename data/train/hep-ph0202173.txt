    "the experimental studies of nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) collisions at the sps and rhic provide a rich information on hadron observables ( multiplicities and momentum spectra ) .",
    "an extensive experimental program is motivated by a possibility to create a new state of matter  the quark gluon plasma ( qgp )  in a laboratory .",
    "any theoretical description of the qgp requires a macroscopic approach : statistical mechanics to describe the static properties of the matter and hydrodynamics to describe the system evolution . the equilibrium hadron gas ( hg ) model describes remarkably well the hadron multiplicities measured in pb+pb and au+au collisions at top sps ( @xmath1  gev per nucleon pair ) @xcite and rhic ( @xmath2  gev ) @xcite energies , where the creation of qgp is expected .",
    "the hg model assumes the following formula for the hadron thermal multiplicities in the grand canonical ensemble ( g.c.e . ) : @xmath3^{-1}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the system volume and temperature , respectively , @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote particle masses and degeneracy factors .",
    "the particle chemical potential @xmath8 in eq.([stat ] ) is defined as @xmath9  , where @xmath10 denote the baryonic number strangeness and charm of particle @xmath11 .",
    "the baryonic chemical potential @xmath12 regulates the baryonic density of the hg system whereas strange @xmath13 and charm @xmath14 chemical potentials should be found from the requirement of zero value for the total strangeness and charm in the system ( in our consideration we neglect small effects of a non - zero electrical chemical potential ) .",
    "the total multiplicities @xmath15 in the hg model include the resonance decay contributions : @xmath16 where @xmath17 are the corresponding decay branching ratios .",
    "the hadron yield ratios @xmath18 in the g.c.e .",
    "are the functions of @xmath5 and @xmath12 and are independent of the volume parameter @xmath4 .",
    "the temperature parameters extracted from fitting the multiplicity data are approximately the same for the sps and rhic energies : @xmath19  mev @xcite .",
    "this value is close to an estimate of the temperature @xmath20 for the qgp ",
    "hg transition obtained in lattice qcd simulations at zero baryonic density ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one may therefore argue that qgp formed at the early stage of a+a reaction hadronizes into a locally equilibrated hg , and the chemical composition of this hadron gas is weakly affected by the subsequent hadron rescatterings .",
    "the production of charmonium states @xmath0 and @xmath21 have been measured in a+a collisions at cern sps over the last 15 years by the na38 and na50 collaborations .",
    "these studies were mainly motivated by the theoretical suggestion @xcite to use @xmath0 meson as a probe for deconfinement in a+a collisions .",
    "recently the thermal model @xcite and the statistical coalescence model ( scm ) @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for the charmonium production in a+a collisions were formulated .",
    "the total @xmath0 multiplicity , @xmath22 , in the thermal model @xcite is given by eq .",
    "( [ dec ] ) , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are calculated according to eq.([stat ] ) and @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 are the decay branching ratios of the excited charmonium states into @xmath0 .",
    "the thermal model @xcite predicts that at high collision energies the @xmath0 to @xmath30 ratio is independent of @xmath31 and the number of nucleon participants @xmath32 .",
    "this is because both @xmath33 and @xmath34 multiplicities are proportional to the system volume and the hadronization temperature is expected to be approximately constant at high collision energies .",
    "the scm @xcite assumes that charmonium states are formed at the hadronization stage .",
    "this is similar to the thermal model @xcite .",
    "however , in the scm the charmonium states are produced via a coalescence of @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( anti)quarks created by the hard parton collisions at the early stage of a+a reaction .",
    "the number of created @xmath37 pairs , @xmath38 , in hard parton collisions , differs in general from the result expected in the equilibrium hg .",
    "one needs then a _ charm enhancement _ factor @xmath39 @xcite @xcite in the hg model . ] to adjust the thermal hg results to the required average number , @xmath40 , of @xmath37 pairs .",
    "the open charm hadron yield is enhanced by a factor @xmath39 and charmonium yield by a factor @xmath41 in comparison with the equilibrium hg predictions .",
    "this leads to a difference between the thermal model and scm predictions for charmonia multiplicities .    the canonical ensemble ( c.e . ) formulation of the scm is @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the hg multiplicities of all particles with hidden and open charm , respectively .",
    "the canonical suppression factor @xmath45 in eq.([ncc1 ] ) is due to the exact charm conservation ( see e.g. , @xcite , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the modified bessel functions ) .",
    "if @xmath48 is known , eq.([ncc1 ] ) can be used to find the charm enhancement factor @xmath39 and calculate then the @xmath0 multiplicity : @xmath49 where @xmath22 is the total ( thermal plus excited charmonium decays ) hg @xmath0 multiplicity .",
    "note that the second term in the right - hand side of eq.([ncc1 ] ) gives only a tiny correction to the first term , i.e. most of the created @xmath37 pairs are transformed into the open charm hadrons .",
    "eqs.([ncc1],[npsi ] ) lead then to : @xmath50 @xmath51    eq.([ncc1 ] ) assumes an exact conservation of @xmath52 and ` statistical fluctuations ' of @xmath53 numbers .",
    "a more accurate treatment with ` dynamical ' ( poisson - like ) distribution of @xmath54 leads to @xcite : @xmath55 eq.([jpsi ] ) coincides with eqs.([ncc1],[npsi ] ) at both @xmath56 and @xmath57 limits ( see eqs.([npsi1],[npsi2 ] ) ) .",
    "this is because at @xmath56 the probabilities to create zero , @xmath58 , and one , @xmath59 , @xmath37 pairs are only important . on the other hand , at @xmath60 the statistical and dynamical fluctuations of @xmath54 both obey the poisson law distribution .",
    "the centrality dependence of @xmath61 in a+b nucleus - nucleus collisions can be calculated in glauber s approach , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the impact parameter , @xmath64 is the nuclear overlap function and @xmath65 is the @xmath66 production cross section for nucleon - nucleon collisions . as discussed in ref.@xcite , the deconfined medium can substantially modify charm production at the sps , i.e. , @xmath65 in a+b collisions can be different from the corresponding cross section measured in a nucleon - nucleon collision experiment .",
    "the present analysis treats @xmath65 at the sps energy as a free parameter .",
    "its value is fixed by fitting the na50 data .    in the na50 experiments @xcite the drell - yan muon pair multiplicity ( either measured or calculated from the minimum bias data )",
    "is used as a reference for the @xmath0 `` suppression pattern '' .",
    "the number of drell - yan pairs is also proportional to the number of primary nucleon - nucleon collisions : @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the nucleon - nucleon production cross section of @xmath69 drell - yan pairs .",
    "the prime means that the pairs should satisfy the kinematical conditions of the na50 spectrometer .",
    "as the drell - yan cross section is isospin dependent , an average value is used : @xmath70 . for the case of pb+pb collisions , @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath73b @xcite .",
    "the quantity to be studied is the ratio @xmath74 @xmath75 is the decay probability of @xmath0 into @xmath76 .",
    "only the fraction @xmath77 of @xmath76 pairs satisfying the kinematical conditions of the na50 spectrometer can be registered .",
    "we treat @xmath77 in eq.([rb ] ) as one more model free parameter .    in the na50 experiment ,",
    "the neutral transversal energy @xmath78 of produced particles was used to measure centrality of the collisions .",
    "this variable , however , provides a reliable measure of the centrality only if it does not exceed a certain maximum value : @xmath79 gev ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the average number of participants is a linear function of the transversal energy , @xmath80 , in the domain @xmath79  gev ( @xmath81  gev ) . at @xmath82",
    "gev the number of @xmath83 does not change essentially as @xmath78 grows .",
    "therefore , the data at @xmath84 gev do not represent a centrality dependence of the @xmath0 suppression pattern but rather its dependence on fluctuations of the stopping energy at approximately _ fixed _ number of participants .",
    "the influence of such fluctuations on @xmath0 multiplicity can be studied in the framework of the scm model @xcite .",
    "+   fig .  1 : the dependence of the @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio on the transversal energy .",
    "the normal nuclear suppression curve is obtained at @xmath85  mb .",
    "the scm lines are calculated using eq.([rb ] ) .",
    "the vertical line shows the applicability domain of the scm , @xmath86 .",
    "the scm fit of the na50 data with eq.([rb ] ) is shown in fig .  1 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "the model parameters are : @xmath87 with @xmath5 and @xmath12 fixed by hadron yield data .",
    "the model requires rather large enhancement for the open charm production ( up to a factor of about @xmath88 within the rapidity window of the na50 spectrometer ) .",
    "a direct measurement of the open charm in pb+pb at cern sps by na60 would allow to test this prediction .",
    "the scm does not describe the na50 data at small values of @xmath78 ( the peripheral collisions with @xmath89  gev ) .",
    "this can be also seen from the @xmath90 data . for @xmath91",
    "mev the value of the thermal ratio is @xmath92 .",
    "this is in agreement with data in pb+pb collisions at sps for @xmath86 , but is in contradiction with data in p+p , p+a and very peripheral a+a collisions .",
    "this fact was first noticed in ref .",
    "the number of directly produced @xmath37 pairs at the rhic energies can be estimated in the pqcd approach and used then as the input for the scm .",
    "the pqcd calculations for @xmath93 production cross sections were first done in ref.@xcite . for the cross section @xmath94 of the charm production in p+p collisions",
    "we use the results presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "this leads to the value of @xmath95  mb at @xmath96  gev and the @xmath31-dependence of the cross section for @xmath97  gev is parameterized as @xcite : @xmath98 with @xmath99  @xmath73b , @xmath100  gev , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the number of produced @xmath37 pairs in a+a collisions is proportional to the number of primary n+n collisions , @xmath103 , which in turn is proportional to @xmath104 @xcite : @xmath105 where @xmath106  mb is the inelastic n+n cross sections , @xmath107  barn@xmath108 .",
    "the results of the scm can be studied analytically according to eqs.([npsi1],[npsi2 ] ) in the limiting cases of small and large numbers of @xmath48 . for @xmath109",
    "one finds : @xmath110 where we use the energy dependence of the pion multiplicity per nucleon participant @xmath111 @xcite which approximately works in the sps",
    " rhic energy region .",
    "the behavior ( [ lim1 ] ) corresponds to the @xmath0 suppression : the ratio @xmath112 decreases with increasing of both @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this takes place at the sps : this energy is still too `` low '' as @xmath113 even in the most central pb+pb collisions .",
    "however , the behavior of the @xmath0 to @xmath54 ratio is changed dramatically at the rhic energies @xcite ( see fig .  2 and ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    in central au+au collisions at",
    "@xmath96  gev the expected value of @xmath114 is essentially larger than unit . for @xmath115 one finds ( @xmath116 ) : @xmath117",
    "in ref.@xcite we formulated the hypothesis that the kinetic freeze - out of @xmath0 and @xmath21 mesons takes place directly at hadronization .",
    "the effect of rescattering in the hadronic phase was recently studied within a `` hydro + cascade '' approach @xcite .",
    "a+a collisions are considered there to proceed in three stages : hydrodynamic qgp expansion ( `` hydro '' ) , transition from qgp to hg ( `` switching '' ) and the stage of hadronic rescatterings and resonance decays ( `` cascade '' ) .",
    "the switching from hydro to cascade takes place at @xmath119 , where the spectrum of hadrons leaving the surface of the qgp  hg transition is taken as an input for the subsequent cascade calculations .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite suggest that the transverse momentum spectra of @xmath120 is only weakly affected during the cascade stage and give therefore a straightforward measure of the collective hydro velocity at the ` switching ' surface @xmath119 . in ref .",
    "@xcite we demonstrated that in pb+pb collisions at 158  a@xmath121gev the @xmath118-spectra of @xmath122 @xcite can be explained simultaneously with the @xmath118-spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath21 mesons @xcite using the same set of the hadronization parameters . assuming the fluid freeze - out at constant temperature @xmath5 , the transverse mass spectrum of @xmath123-th hadron species in cylindrically symmetric and longitudinally boost invariant fluid expansion equals approximately to ( see ref .",
