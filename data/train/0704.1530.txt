    "the current great interest in the @xmath10-nucleus interaction exists because of the attractive nature of the @xmath5 interaction in the s - wave @xcite , and the consequent possibility of the existence of quasi - bound , virtual or resonant @xmath10-nucleus states @xcite .",
    "the exact nature of these states , of course , depends upon the precise knowledge of the @xmath5 scattering matrix at low energies . as the @xmath1 is a highly unstable meson ( lifetime @xmath11 ) , this precise information is difficult to obtain directly .",
    "it can only be obtained from the eta producing reactions through the final state interaction . with this motivation , starting with the early experiments near threshold at saclay on the @xmath12 and the @xmath13 reactions , measurements have been carried out near threshold and beyond at jlich and uppsala using the cosy and celsius rings respectively . in this series of experiments , the recent data on the @xmath0 reaction using the wasa / promice setup at the celsius storage ring of the svedberg laboratory , uppsala are thematically complete and",
    "cover the excess energy , q , ( @xmath14 ) ranging from around threshold to 107 mev .",
    "the data @xcite ( integrated over other variables ) include the invariant mass distribution over the whole excess energy range for the @xmath2 , @xmath15 and @xmath6 systems and angular distributions for the proton , deuteron and the eta meson . like the @xmath12 reaction , the ( inclusive )",
    "@xmath2 invariant mass distribution exhibits a large enhancement near threshold and hence appears promising to study the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "the @xmath15 and @xmath6 invariant mass distributions do not show any such enhancement .",
    "all observed angular distributions are nearly isotropic .    like in our earlier studies on the @xmath12 reaction our primary aim in this paper is to investigate the above mentioned data on the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution to obtain a better understanding of the @xmath16 as well as the @xmath2 interaction .",
    "we speculate , from our experience on the study of the @xmath17 reaction @xcite , that in the region of low @xmath2 relative energy this set of data will be mainly determined by the @xmath2 interaction , though the three - body nature of the final state may introduce some uncertainty in this conclusion .",
    "we present a study of the @xmath18 reaction which includes the effect of the final state interaction .",
    "we have investigated two possible diagrams for the production mechanism : the direct mechanism and the two step process of @xmath1 production .",
    "the direct mechanism proceeds via an intermediate @xmath19 reaction with one of the nucleons in the deuteron as a spectator .",
    "the @xmath1 meson in the two step model is produced in two steps , namely , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , hence involving the participation and sharing of the transferred momentum by three nucleons .",
    "the two step model for @xmath1 production was first used in @xcite and the data on the @xmath22 reaction was well explained .",
    "the vertices at the two steps have been described by the corresponding off - shell @xmath23-matrices .",
    "the @xmath23-matrix for @xmath21 is taken from a coupled channel calculation @xcite , and that for @xmath20 is obtained from the said program provided by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the final state interaction between the @xmath1 and the deuteron",
    "is explicitly incorporated through an @xmath7 @xmath23-matrix , @xmath24 .",
    "this @xmath23-matrix , which is required to be half - off - shell , is described in two ways .",
    "one choice involves taking a  factorized form \" which is given by an off - shell form factor multiplied by an on - shell part given by an effective range expansion up to the fourth power in momentum .",
    "the parameters of this expansion have been taken from an existing recent relativistic faddeev equation solution for the @xmath4 system @xcite corresponding to different @xmath5 scattering amplitudes .",
    "the off - shell form factor will be described in the next sections and is chosen to have a form without any adjustable parameters .",
    "the second prescription involves solving few body equations within the finite rank approximation ( fra ) to obtain @xmath24 .",
    "this approach has been used in literature for the @xmath2 , @xmath25he and @xmath26he systems @xcite .",
    "we perform calculations for both the prescriptions using different models of the elementary coupled channel @xmath1-nucleon @xmath23-matrix which characterize them .",
    "the interaction between the @xmath10 meson and the proton in the final state , to a certain extent is contained implicitly in our calculations .",
    "this is due to the fact that we describe the @xmath21 vertex by a @xmath23-matrix , which has been modeled to include the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "this off - shell @xmath23-matrix treats the @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 channels in a coupled channel formalism @xcite and reproduces the experimental data on this reaction very well .",
    "the effect of @xmath6 final state interaction ( fsi ) is incorporated in the spirit of the watson - migdal fsi prescription @xcite , in which our model @xmath0 production amplitude is multiplied by a factor which incorporates the fsi between the proton and the deuteron .",
    "this factor is taken to be the frequently used @xcite inverse jost function , @xmath30^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath31 is the relative @xmath6 momentum .",
    "the assumption implicit in this approximation that the mechanism for the primary reaction be short ranged is very well fulfilled in the @xmath10-production reactions .",
    "the momentum transfer in these reactions near threshold is around 700 mev / c .",
    "we include fsi for both doublet ( @xmath32 ) and quadruplet ( @xmath33 ) @xmath6 states .",
    "the @xmath1-nucleon @xmath23-matrix , which characterizes our calculations , is not precisely known .",
    "recent theoretical works on the @xmath34 reaction @xcite conclude that the data on this reaction can be reproduced with the strength of the real part of the @xmath1-nucleon scattering length ranging between 0.42 and 0.72 fm . in our earlier work on the @xmath22 reaction @xcite",
    ", we found a good agreement with data , with the real part of the scattering length taken to be around 0.75 fm .",
    "this value was also found to be in agreement with the @xmath34 data in a @xmath35-matrix calculation of the final state @xmath7 interaction in @xcite .",
    "the same authors as in @xcite , recently performed a fit to a wide variety of data which includes the @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 reactions and gave their best fit value of the @xmath1-nucleon scattering length , @xmath40 to be @xmath41 fm @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 effective range parameters are given in @xcite for @xmath40 up to @xmath42 fm .",
    "hence , in the present work we perform calculations with different models of the @xmath5 interaction , which correspond to three different values of the @xmath5 scattering length , ranging from @xmath43 fm to @xmath42 fm .",
    "we find that the cross sections calculated using the two - step model and the above inputs for the final state interaction reproduce most of the features of the experimental data reasonably well .",

    "@xcite the contribution of three different diagrams , namely , the pick - up ( a direct one - step mechanism of @xmath1 production ) , the impulse approximation and the two - step mechanism ( here the @xmath1 meson is produced in two steps via the @xmath44 and @xmath21 reactions ) to the cross section for the @xmath9 reaction is determined .",
    "the authors in @xcite conclude that the impulse approximation is in general negligible as compared to the other two diagrams , the two - step mechanism is dominant in the near threshold region and the contribution of the pick - up diagram ( referred to as the direct mechanism in the present work ) increases with energy and matches the two - step contribution at an excess energy of @xmath45 mev .",
    "the latter conclusions regarding the contributions of the two step and pick up diagrams are in contrast to the findings of the present work as well as to existing literature on similar kind of reactions .",
    "we note here that the authors in @xcite do not include the final state interaction in their calculations in any way .",
    "they treat the kinematics and the dependence of the pion propagator ( appearing in the two step model ) on the fermi momenta in an approximate way .",
    "the @xmath23-matrices which enter as an input to the two step model are simply extracted from experimental cross sections and are hence not proper off - shell @xmath23-matrices . as a result of the above approximations , the authors in @xcite do not reproduce the observed enhancement in the @xmath2 invariant mass distribution near threshold , and unlike the observed isotropic distributions , find anisotropy in their calculated angular distributions .    the contribution from the direct mechanism ( or the so - called pick - up diagram of @xcite ) to the total cross sections",
    "is found to be about four orders of magnitude smaller than the two - step contribution at threshold in the present work .",
    "the one - step contribution does increase with energy ( as also found in @xcite ) , however , even at the highest energy for which data is available ( @xmath46 mev ) it remains two orders of magnitude smaller than that due to the two - step model .",
    "this is in contrast to the observations in @xcite , where the two processes give comparable contributions at high energies .",
    "the difference of orders of magnitude between the two processes can be understood as a result of the large momentum transfer , @xmath47 , in the one - step process .",
    "this @xmath47 , which is very large in the threshold region ( @xmath48 mev / c ) continues to be large even at high energies .",
    "for example , it is @xmath49 mev / c even at the highest beam energy of 1096 mev .",
    "this finding of ours is very similar to the previous studies of the reactions involving high momentum transfer .",

    "yet another calculation @xcite of the cross section for the @xmath51he @xmath52 reaction ( where @xmath53 ) the two - step model was found to describe the data on these reactions up to @xmath54 gev quite well . in @xcite , in connection with the @xmath55 reaction , the authors claim that for a beam energy of 1 - 3 gev , the one - step mechanism predicts 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller cross sections as compared to the two - step mechanism .",

    "the large effect of @xmath6 fsi in the region of small @xmath162 , however , may not be taken with confidence as the value of @xmath160 in this region is large ( as shown in fig .",
    "3 ) , where the s - wave effective range expansion ( eq .",
    "( [ pde ] ) ) for the calculation of jost function might not be sufficient . in any case , it appears that the effects of both the @xmath7 and the @xmath6 fsi on the @xmath7 invariant mass distribution are significant .",
    "if we disregard the calculated @xmath6 effect for small @xmath162 , the @xmath7 and @xmath6 fsi dominate in regions well separated from each other .",
    "apart from the fsi , another important ingredient of our calculations is the two - step description of the production vertex .",
    "because of the large momentum transfer , we believe , as has also been stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the angular distribution of the outgoing particles is probably more sensitive to the description of the production vertex .",
    "inclusive angular distributions have been measured for all the three outgoing particles in the @xmath168 reaction . in fig .",
    "7 , we show the calculated angular distributions for all the three outgoing particles along with the measured distributions .",
    "we show results without any fsi , with @xmath7 fsi and with @xmath7 and @xmath6 fsi both included .",
    "as each angle has contribution from a range of @xmath161 as well as @xmath160 , the calculated results include integration of the cross section over these variables .",
    "we find that the observed nearly isotropic nature of the experimental angular distributions for the proton , deuteron and eta already gets reproduced by the plane wave calculations .",
    "the effect of both @xmath7 and @xmath6 fsi is large and persists over all the angles .",
    "their inclusion brings the magnitudes of the proton and deuteron angular distributions near to experiments .",
    "the magnitude of the eta distribution , however , does not seem to be affected much with the fsi .",
    "experimental data also exist on the total cross section . in fig .",
    "8 , we compare the total cross sections calculated including both the @xmath7 and @xmath6 fsi with the measured cross sections .",
    "the results are shown with the factorized form of @xmath7 fsi with deuteron form factor for the set corresponding to @xmath5 scattering length equal to @xmath169 fm . as we see , the calculated cross sections are in good agreement with the experimental data .    in fig .",
    "8 we also give the cross sections calculated for the one - step direct mechanism ( fig .",
    "2 ) mentioned in the previous section . near threshold , these cross sections are about four orders of magnitude below those obtained from the two - step model and two orders of magnitude smaller in the high energy range . as mentioned in the introduction , this observation is similar to that in other works involving large momentum transfer reactions @xcite , and is understandable because the momentum transfer continues to be large ( @xmath49 mev / c ) in the @xmath170 reaction even at an excess energy as large as 100 mev .",
    "now we make an observation about the importance of off - shell scattering in treating @xmath7 fsi near threshold . the scattering part of the @xmath7 wave function ( eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) ) , gets contributions from the off - shell as well as the on - shell scattering in the nucleus . to see quantitatively the relative importance of these two contributions to the cross section for the @xmath168 reaction , in fig .",
    "9 we show their contributions separately in the @xmath7 invariant mass distribution .",
    "these results include only the @xmath7 fsi generated from the factorized prescription using rfe and the deuteron form factor for the @xmath7 @xmath23-matrix .",
    "we find that near threshold the off - shell scattering completely dominates the threshold enhancement . at higher excess energy ,",
    "as expected , the on - shell contribution takes over .",
    "finally we show the nature of agreement of our calculated results with the invariant @xmath7 mass distribution . in fig .",
    "10 , we compare the calculated results including both the @xmath7 and @xmath6 fsi with the experimental results .",
    "the results are for a@xmath164 = 1.07 + i0.26 fm calculated with the factorized prescription using rfe and the off - shell factor generated from the deuteron form factor . as we see",
    "the overall agreement is reasonably good .",
    "the invariant @xmath7 mass distribution in the @xmath171 reaction has been studied by describing the production mechanism in terms of a two step model with a pion being produced in the intermediate state .",
    "the @xmath7 final state interaction ( fsi ) has been included in ( a ) a factorized form involving an on - shell @xmath24 and two types of off - shell form factors and ( b ) by solving few body equations within the fra .",
    "the @xmath6 fsi is included through a jost function .",
    "the conclusions of this investigation can be summarized as :    1 .   experimentally observed large enhancement in the cross section near small @xmath7 excess energy , @xmath162 is reproduced by the @xmath7 fsi .",
    "the rise in the cross section at large @xmath162 ( which corresponds to a range of small momenta , @xmath160 ) can be accounted for by the @xmath6 fsi .",
    "2 .   quantitative reproduction of the large enhancement requires @xmath7 fsi corresponding to large values of @xmath40 . in the present calculation it is around 1.07 + i0.26 fm .",
    "the calculations successfully reproduce the observed isotropic angular distribution of the proton and the deuteron in the final state .",
    "the total cross sections for the @xmath167 reaction are also well reproduced .",
    "the off - shell part of the @xmath7 scattering dominates near threshold .",
    "the results for two different choices of the off - shell extrapolation factor in the factorized form of the @xmath7 fsi are similar .",
    "the authors wish to thank r. a. arndt for providing the computer codes for evaluating the @xmath44 @xmath23-matrix .",
    "this work is done under a research grant by the department of science and technology , government of india .",
