    "triangle singularities , discussed long ago by landau  @xcite , are catching the attention of hadron physicists recently .",
    "the large amount of phenomenology gathered in different facilities studying intermediate energy reactions and hadron spectra has widened the range of possible cases where triangle singularities are relevant . in essence",
    "the singularities appear from feynmann diagrams with three particles in a loop when the particles are placed on shell and the momenta are colinear . yet",
    ", some condition is also necessary for the singularity to appear and it is that the mechanisms reflect a classical problem in which the external particle @xmath10 decays into @xmath11 and @xmath12 , particle @xmath11 decays into @xmath13 and an external particle @xmath14 and then @xmath12 and @xmath13 fuse to give an external particle @xmath15 .",
    "this is the content of coleman - norton theorem  @xcite .",
    "a very simple analytical way to see when the triangle singularity appears can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a critical discussion of the suggestion made in refs .",
    "@xcite associating the narrow peak of the pentaquark @xmath16 observed in the lhcb collaboration  @xcite to a triangle singularity is made .",
    "recent examples of relevant triangle singularities can be seen in the @xmath17 and @xmath18 decays  @xcite , the latter one violating isospin , which is abnormally enhanced due to the triangle singularities  @xcite .",
    "another example is the case of the  @xmath19 \" claimed as a new resonance by the compass collaboration  @xcite , which , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite and shown explicitly in refs .",
    "@xcite , represents the decay mode of the @xmath7 into @xmath20 due to a triangle singularity coming from the @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 combining to give the @xmath24 .",
    "a more recent example is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the enhancement in the cross section of the @xmath25 reaction around the @xmath26 center of mass energy @xmath27 mev is associated to a triangle singularity stemming from the formation of a resonance called @xmath28 that is dynamically generated from the vector - baryon interaction  @xcite .",
    "this resonance finds support in the @xmath29 reaction close to the @xmath30 and @xmath31 thresholds  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the theoretical analysis ) . for the present problem",
    "the resonance decays into @xmath31 , then @xmath5 and the @xmath32 merge to give the @xmath33 .    in this work",
    "we wish to show that a peak appears precisely at @xmath3 mev due to a process induced by the nearby @xmath34 going to @xmath35 , @xmath5 and @xmath36 merging into the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "the strength of the peak will have the same quantum numbers as the resonance from which it comes from , but the singularity appears at @xmath3 mev , producing a peak that has given rise to the claim of the @xmath8 resonance  @xcite .",
    "the information on the @xmath8 in the particle data group book ( pdg )  @xcite is scarce .",
    "it has been seen in a few experiments and the mass and width are quoted as @xmath37 mev and @xmath38 mev , respectively .",
    "the decay modes reported are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , but one finds there @xmath44  @xcite , @xmath45  @xcite , @xmath46  @xcite , @xmath47  @xcite , from which one concludes that the sum of branching fractions of all decay channels where the resonance is observed , is only a small fraction of the total .",
    "the main decay mode is still not identified . from the study presented here",
    "we would conclude that the main decay mode of the peak should be the @xmath9 , which can be seen in @xmath48 channel , a decay mode not investigated so far .",
    "the tensor mesons have been for a long time an example of a successful classification in @xmath49 multiplets with a @xmath50 structure  @xcite . however , the low lying tensor mesons , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 qualify well as dynamically generated states from the vector - vector interaction  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a list of reactions supporting this picture ) . in this sense",
    ", the @xmath52 is mostly made from @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "if we allow this resonance to decay into @xmath54 , then @xmath5 and @xmath55 ( with a mass slightly above the mass threshold of @xmath56 ) , we find a triangle singularity at @xmath3 mev .",
    "since the width of the @xmath52 is only @xmath57 mev , the strength of this resonance at @xmath3 mev is very small and the chances of the singularity at @xmath3 mev to show up due to the decay of the @xmath52 in that particular channel are very dim . yet ,",
    "an inspection of the pdg shows that in between the @xmath52 and @xmath8 there are two @xmath58 resonances , the @xmath59 and @xmath34 . due to the proximity of the mass of the @xmath34 to the @xmath3 mev",
    ", this latter resonance has more chances to influence the @xmath3 mev region .",
    "the @xmath34 is also not a very well studied resonance , but the decay modes @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath40 have been observed .",
    "if the @xmath34 couples to @xmath62 , then it should also couple to @xmath54 , which guarantees that it also decays into @xmath63 if @xmath64 via @xmath65 exchange .",
