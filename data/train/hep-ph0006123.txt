    "neutrino astronomy is now an emerging field and entails the need to have improved flux estimates as well as a good understanding of relevant detector capabilities for all flavor neutrinos , particularly in light of the recent growing experimental support for flavor oscillations @xcite .",
    "several high - energy cosmic neutrino ( @xmath1gev ) detectors based on under water / ice muon detection are now at proposal or construction stages @xcite and alternative techniques for @xmath2  gev neutrinos are being considered through coherent radio @xcite or acoustic @xcite pulses as well as through horizontal air shower measurements with conventional arrays @xcite or with fluorescent light either from the ground @xcite or from orbiting detectors @xcite . a number of astrophysical high - energy neutrino sources , such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ,",
    "have been discussed in the literature and predicted to produce fluxes that could be detected in some of these detectors @xcite . in the event of a successful detection of high - energy astrophysical neutrinos the range of parameter space for flavor oscillations that can be tested",
    "could be considerably enhanced provided a flavor identification can be done .",
    "cosmic tau neutrinos are possibly the easiest flavor to identify above 10@xmath3 gev .",
    "two ideas have already been put forward based on the short decay lifetime of the @xmath4 produced in charged current interactions .",
    "there is a suggestion of measuring 10@xmath3 gev @xmath5 flux through double shower ( _ double bang _ ) events in under water / ice erenkov telescopes @xcite .",
    "a more recent suggestion is to detect a small pile up of upgoing @xmath6-like events in the 10@xmath7 10@xmath8  gev range with a fairly flat zenith angle dependence @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the lpm effect , that lengthens electromagnetic showers in water and ice , has been suggested to separate electron neutrino charged current interactions from the rest .",
    "this could be done with erenkov light detectors or with the radio technique for energies above @xmath9 gev @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that a combination of several of such techniques will allow the establishment of neutrino flavor ratios at energies above @xmath10  gev .",
    "we will concentrate on cosmic tau neutrino detection in this article . specifically",
    ", we discuss in some detail , the prospects for detection of high - energy cosmic tau neutrinos originating from the cores of agn .",
    "we consider vacuum flavor oscillations as an example to illustrate the possibility offered by detectors in construction to distinguish between different neutrino flavors . for absolute event rates we use upper limit flux calculations as an example @xcite and",
    "consider @xmath11km@xmath12 detector sizes which are now being planned @xcite .",
    "both the energy ranges of interest and the relative numbers of @xmath4- and @xmath6-like event rates are however independent of the assumed normalization of the neutrino fluxes .",
    "we show that for the chosen neutrino flux , a km@xmath13 size surface area under ice / water erenkov light neutrino detector may be able to either set useful upper limits or may obtain first examples of the high - energy tau neutrinos originating from this cosmologically distant astrophysical source .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii , after a brief discussion of intrinsic production mechanisms of high - energy muon and tau neutrinos in agns , we estimate the relevant vacuum flavor oscillation probability . in section iii , we discuss in some detail the detection technique making use of the double shower structure of the tau neutrino charged current interactions and calculate the expected event rates for a typical km@xmath12 surface size under water / ice detector . in section iv , we summarize our results .",
    "agns are the brightest objects in the sky and high - energy photons reaching tens of thousands of gev have been observed from them .",
    "this is commonly interpreted as an indication that some kind of fermi acceleration is taking place . in conventional models , electrons are the particles that get accelerated . it has been argued that if fermi mechanisms are able to accelerate electrons in these objects , protons could also be accelerated by them . in proton acceleration models ,",
    "the photons arise from neutral pion decays either in @xmath14 or @xmath15 collisions .",
    "if this is true , electron and muon neutrinos are also expected to be produced at similar flux levels from charged pion decays .",
    "neutrino detection can provide the signature for proton acceleration in agn and it is one of the main goals of neutrino detectors in construction and design stages .",
    "for an update review of various @xmath16 and @xmath17 flux estimates from agns in @xmath18 and @xmath15 collisions ( as well as from some other interesting astrophysical / cosmological sites ) , see @xcite . we will here explore the expected tau neutrino fluxes intrinsically produced in the collisions and how these fluxes can vary in a possible neutrino oscillation scenario .",
    "in @xmath18 collisions , high - energy @xmath16 and @xmath17 are mainly produced through the resonant reaction @xmath19 .",
    "the same collisions will give rise to a greatly suppressed high - energy @xmath5 ( and @xmath20 ) flux mainly through the reaction @xmath21 .",
    "the production cross - section for @xmath22 is essentially up to three orders of magnitude lower than that of @xmath23 production for the relevant center of mass energy scale .",
    "moreover the branching ratio of @xmath24 to decay eventually into @xmath5 ( @xmath20 ) is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than for @xmath23 to subsequently decay into @xmath16 and @xmath17 through @xmath25 .",
    "these two suppression factors along with the relevant kinematic limits give approximately the ratio of intrinsic fluxes of tau neutrinos and muon neutrinos as : @xmath26 .    in @xmath15 collisions",
    ", the @xmath5 flux may be obtained through @xmath27 .",
    "the relatively small cross - section for @xmath22 production together with the low branching ratio into @xmath5 implies that the @xmath5 flux in @xmath15 collisions is also suppressed up to @xmath28 orders of magnitude relative to @xmath16 and/or @xmath17 fluxes .",
    "the situation is quite similar to the prompt atmospheric @xmath5 flux calculation ; the result is basically a rescaling of the prompt @xmath17 flux from the decay of charmed @xmath29 s and results in a negligibly small @xmath5 flux for the energies under discussion @xcite .    in proton acceleration models the intrinsically produced tau neutrino flux",
    "is thus expected to be very small , typically a factor between @xmath30 and @xmath31 relative to electron and muon neutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "however , recent experimental measurements of atmospheric neutrinos suggest that neutrinos could just have vacuum flavor oscillations and the tau neutrino flux would be dramatically enhanced .",
    "it has been pointed out that there are no matter effects for high - energy cosmic tau neutrinos originating from cores of agns primarily because of relatively small matter density in the vicinity of core of the agn for all relevant @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we will restrict the following discussion to vacuum oscillations between two flavors , @xmath17 and @xmath5 , for simplicity .",
    "the flavor precession probability for non vanishing vacuum mixing angle is obtained from the effective hamiltonian matrix in the two flavor basis @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 the neutrino energy , leading to the well known result : @xmath38 if we take the values of @xmath39 and @xmath32 suggested by recent superkamiokande data ( @xmath40 ev@xmath13 ) @xcite and @xmath41 100 mpc ( 1  pc @xmath42 cm ) as a representative distance between the agn and our galaxy , then the above rapidly oscillating probability averages out to @xmath43 for all relevant neutrino energies to be considered for detection .",
    "very similar fluxes of muon and tau neutrinos would thus be expected .",
    "let us further note that after averaging the @xmath44 given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) is independent of not only @xmath37 but also @xmath32 and thus leads to a constant suppression of high - energy cosmic muon neutrino flux .",
    "the deficit measured by superkamiokande in atmospheric muon neutrino flux may currently be explained either through @xmath45 or through @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is a sterile neutrino is now being disfavoured @xcite . ] . in the first case and for high - energy neutrinos originating at cosmological distances ,",
    "the ratio @xmath48 is close to 1/2 .",
    "therefore , a ratio different from 1/2 excludes this possibility .",
    "high - energy cosmic tau neutrino detection could be achieved by making use of the characteristic double shower events @xcite or by the pileup effect expected as they travel through the earth @xcite .",
    "such events could be seen in conventional neutrino telescopes and in principle also with other alternative techniques that have been proposed .",
    "we will discuss in some detail the possibility of detecting double shower events for conventional underground telescopes by estimating rates using the the fluxes of ref .",
    "@xcite and the oscillation probability addressed in the previous section .",
    "this is intended to provide a reference calculation .",
    "the downgoing cosmic tau neutrinos reaching close to the surface of the detector may undergo a charged current deep inelastic scattering with nuclei inside / near the detector and produce a tau lepton in addition to a hadronic shower .",
    "this tau lepton traverses a distance , on average proportional to its energy , before it decays back into a tau neutrino and a second shower most often induced by decaying hadrons .",
    "the second shower is expected to carry about twice as much energy as the first and such double shower signals are commonly referred to as double bangs . as tau leptons are not expected to have further relevant interactions ( with high - energy loss ) in their decay timescale , the two showers should be separated by a _ clean _",
    "@xmath6-like track @xcite .",
    "we are going to restrict our estimate to downgoing neutrinos as at these energies tau neutrinos that go through the earth interact .",
    "effectively the process of interaction and tau decays can be regarded as an energy degradation to the range @xmath49  gev @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the two shower signature will be difficult to be resolved below @xmath50gev ( see below ) .    for downgoing cosmic tau neutrinos , the _",
    "double bang _ event rate in water / ice is estimated using @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the area of the neutrino telescope and @xmath53 gives the probability that a tau neutrino of energy @xmath37 produces two contained and separable showers with the tau lepton energy greater than @xmath54 .",
    "it is given by : @xmath55 \\frac{\\mbox{d}\\sigma^{cc}(e , y)}{\\mbox{d}y},\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the avogadro s number , @xmath57 is the density of the detector medium , @xmath58 is the charged current @xmath59 differential cross - section , @xmath60 is the fraction of neutrino energy that is transferred to the hadron in the laboratory frame .",
    "@xmath29 is the detector length scale which we fix to be @xmath11 km and the tau lepton range @xmath61 which must be contained within @xmath29 is given by : @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( 5 ) , @xmath63 is the lifetime and @xmath64 is the mass of the high - energy tau lepton .",
    "the lower limit of integration in eq . ( 3 ) is @xmath65 .",
    "we take @xmath66 greater than @xmath67 gev because at this energy the tau lepton range ( separation between the two showers ) in water is @xmath68 100 m which allows a clear separation between the two showers . the upper limit of integration in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is taken to be @xmath69  gev as for energies above it the tau lepton range exceeds the telescope size ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    finally in eq . ( 3 ) , d@xmath70d@xmath37 is the differential high - energy tau neutrino flux and is obtained by multiplying @xmath71 given by eq .",
    "( 2 ) with d@xmath72/d@xmath37 for @xmath73 taken from @xcite . in fig .",
    "2 , we depict downgoing differential event rates for double shower events using the parton distributions mrs r@xmath74 from @xcite for km@xmath13 under water neutrino telescopes as an example . we have checked that other modern parton distributions give quite similar events rates and are therefore not depicted here .",
    "we have taken into account the fact that @xmath75 of the times the tau decay does not induce any shower .",
    "for comparison we also plot the @xmath76-like event rate induced by muon neutrinos .",
    "note that these @xmath77 and the tau neutrino interactions in which the tau lepton decays outside the detector volume have identical ( @xmath76-like ) experimental signature .",
    "the signature of double shower events depends on the detector capabilities for shower identification and energy resolution and difficulties can be envisaged .",
    "we have used 100  m as the minimum distance to resolve two showers , what is quite conservative in view of typical spacing between optical modules in an under water / ice detector . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the dependence of shower size and shower separation on neutrino energy @xmath37 in ice and in water for which we have used the parametrization of @xcite . as",
    "shower size is basically proportional to energy , the size of the second shower is on average a factor of 2 higher than the first one ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this value results by taking into account the relevant kinematics of the allowed decay channels and the corresponding branching ratios and using the average energy transfer @xmath78 . the @xmath60 distribution and decay kinematics will lead to a spread in this ratio . while @xmath79 enhances the energy ratio of the second and first showers to a value of about 6 , for @xmath60 values higher than 0.4",
    "the ratio of the two shower sizes starts to be lower than unity obscuring the tau neutrino signature .",
    "another relevant point is the evaluation of the backgrounds , a double shower signature not induced by a tau neutrino . as it was discussed in @xcite such probability",
    "is very small and should not affect the detection of the high - energy cosmic tau neutrino .",
    "also one should take into account the possibility that the muon component of a single cascade induced from a muon or an electron neutrino charged / neutral current interaction can be confused with the second shower of the tau lepton decay",
    ". however , in this case the size of the second shower is smaller than the first one which should be sufficient to distinguish it from a tau neutrino event .",
    "thus , the selection criteria of amplitude of second shower greater than the first one typically by a factor of @xmath68 2 , depending on @xmath60 value , essentially makes the observation background free .",
    "the high - energy neutrino telescopes have quite small double shower event rates ( yr@xmath80sr@xmath80 ) due to small high - energy intrinsic tau neutrinos flux , thus any observed change in this situation may provide indirect evidence of neutrino mass . a corresponding comparable change in this situation",
    "is currently not expected from variations of astrophysical model inputs .",
    "the almost simultaneous measurement of the two showers may provide useful information on the incident neutrino energy as well as the @xmath60 distribution .",
    "summarizing , in the context of relevant backgrounds , we envisage essentially the simultaneous presence of two types of events ( with different topologies ) serving as background for the tau neutrino induced contained but separable double showers connected by a @xmath6-like track such that the amplitude of the second shower is typically 2 times the first one .",
    "the first type of background events are due to relatively long ( @xmath68 10 km ) range muons passing through the detector identified as @xmath6-like tracks .",
    "their estimated number is given by the upper slanted curve in fig .",
    "the second type of background is the single showers due to charged / neutral current interactions .",
    "these may be estimated as 1/10 of the continuous @xmath6-like tracks .",
    "thus , the signature of the tau neutrinos as emphasized earlier remained distinct from these two type of backgrounds .",
    "we emphasize that within the respective energy window , the essential factor in prospective detection of contained but separable double shower events connected by a @xmath6-like track as a signature of tau neutrinos is the _ difference _ in the incident tau neutrino energy dependences on spread and separation of the two showers .",
    "this _ difference _ is also clearly crucial for separating the tau neutrino events from the ( relatively abundent ) @xmath6-like events .",
    "the intrinsic fluxes of the high - energy cosmic neutrinos originating from proton acceleration in cores of agns are estimated to have typically the following ratios : @xmath81 .",
    "thus , if an enhanced @xmath82 ratio ( as compared to no precession situation ) is observed _ correlated _ to the direction of source for high - energy cosmic neutrinos , then it may be an evidence for vacuum flavor oscillations of neutrinos induced by non zero vacuum mixing angle depending on the finer details of the relevant high - energy cosmic neutrino spectra . for vacuum flavor oscillations of high - energy cosmic neutrinos ,",
    "the relevant range of neutrino mixing parameters are : @xmath83 ev@xmath13 with @xmath84 .",
    "we have identified the incident tau neutrino energy range and the relevant neutrino mixing parameters which may give rise to high - energy cosmic tau neutrino induced downward contained but separable double shower events . for @xmath85",
    ", a km@xmath13 detector may be able to obtain first examples of downgoing high - energy cosmic tau neutrinos through contained but separable double shower events or may at least provide some useful relevant upper limits .",
