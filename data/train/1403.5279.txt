    "in the last decades much research into thin magnetic films has been driven by several interesting properties associated with interfaces involving magnetic materials .",
    "the key to the understand these magnetic structures is the knowledge about the basic energies involved .",
    "there are three basic energy concepts : exchange , dipolar and anisotropy energies .",
    "the first controls the magnetic ordering , the second controls the form of the magnetic structures and the latter controls the preferred orientation . both are phenomenological descriptions of fundamental correlations and energies associated with the electronic and crystalline structure of the material",
    ". we must also take into account the surface effects on the magnetic properties because they become increasingly important when the particle size decreases .",
    "systems with reduced dimensionality show properties different from the bulk materials due to finite - size effects . in particular , magnetic ordering temperature and magnetocrystalline anisotropy were shown to be size dependent in many materials .",
    "one of the most important effects studied is the exchange - bias(eb ) effect , discovered in 1956 @xcite .",
    "the eb effect occurs due to exchange coupling between ferromagnetic(fm ) and antiferromagnetic(afm ) .",
    "its signature is a shifted hysteresis loop dislocated from zero field .",
    "the shift is attributed to the frozen in global unidirectional anisotropy of the system .",
    "several interesting properties are obtained from hysteresis loop as the remanent magnetization which is a residual magnetization in the material when the aligning field is reduced to zero , the coercive field required for canceling the residual magnetization and the saturation field which is the field required for forcing all magnetic moments of the sample to point in the direction of the external field .",
    "these features make the exchange bias effect an efficient and reliable way for pinning ferromagnetic layers in spin - valves .",
    "consequently it is largely exploited in technological applications , such as magnetic sensors and data storage devices . at the same time , several aspects of this effect are still unclear from a microscopic point of view , mostly due to different exchange coupling between ferromagnetic(fm ) and antiferromagnetic(afm ) layers and it is difficult to obtain a unique theory @xcite .    in this work",
    "we report a spin dynamics simulation to study the magnetic behavior of a fm layer put over the ( 100 ) face of an uncompensated@xcite afm substrate both with a bcc structure .",
    "the scope of this article is to discuss the role of the exchange interaction across the interface when we insert an anisotropy in the classical xyz heisenberg model to calculate the interactions between the magnetic moments in the fm / afm interface . in the next session",
    "we show our theoretical model .",
    "our system was divided into three regions : fm region , afm region and the int region ( fm / afm interface ) .",
    "the schematic view is represented in the figure [ system1 ] .",
    "theoretically we can consider a pseudo - spin hamiltonian model to describe the system . in this work we use the following hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath0 \\label{hamiltonian }   - \\nonumber \\\\   & - & j_{int}\\sum_{<i , j>~ \\varepsilon~int } ( \\lambda_x s_i^x s_j^x + \\lambda_y s_i^y s_j^y + \\lambda_z s_i^z s_j^z )    \\label{hamiltoniana }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 denotes the spin components at lattice site @xmath2 with the normalization @xmath3 , @xmath4 denotes the neighbor spin , @xmath5 is the exchange coupling constant for fm , @xmath6 is the giromagnetic ratio for fm and afm , @xmath7 is the exchange coupling constant for afm , @xmath8 is the uniaxial anisotropy constant for afm in the x - axis , @xmath9 is the external magnetic field with @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the bohrs magneton . the constants @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 describes the strength of the exchange coupling anisotropy in the fm / afm interface . without loss of generality we can set @xmath15 ,",
    "thus the energy of system will be given as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "for typical value @xmath15mev , the @xmath16 value is about of @xmath17 t or @xmath18koe .",
    "+ we restrict our attention to the case where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the interaction in the interface is of the kind antiferromagnetic with a anisotropic behavior .",
    "the choose those parameters will determine an easy - axis or easy - plane behavior@xcite . looking the equation [ hamiltonian ] , we can note that when @xmath23 , the system has a easy - axis behavior and the energy is minimized in x - direction . if @xmath24 , the behavior is easy - plane and the energy is minimized when the magnetization is in the yz - plane . when @xmath25 we have an isotropic heisenberg model . +",
    "spin dynamics can be described phenomenologically through the well - known landau - lifshitz equation @xcite : @xmath26 , \\label{eqdemov}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the damping parameter . in this work",
    "we use @xmath29 and the adams - moulton predictor - corrector method @xcite to solve this equation .",
    "in this section we show our results for the isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "we present in figure [ his_iso ] the hysteresis loop for the @xmath30-component of magnetization ( @xmath31 ) . in this figure",
    "the total number of fm and afm layers are , respectively , @xmath32 and @xmath33 in figure [ his_iso1800 ] , and @xmath34 and @xmath33 in figure [ his_iso2700 ] .",
    "the numerical calculation is done as follows : an initial configuration is chosen as shown in the figure [ system1 ] .",
    "then an external magnetic field is applied in the @xmath30-direction ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "this field is turned on at time @xmath36 and changed in steps of size @xmath37 . for each value of the magnetic field",
    "@xmath38 time steps are performed in order to equilibrate the system .",
    "when the fm layers reached the saturation the magnetic field is increased or decreased until these layers saturates in the inverse direction .",
    "it is observed that increasing the number of fm layers , the eb effect decreases .",
    "these behaviors are in accordance with the results found in the literature @xcite . using the results from the figure [ his_iso ] we can measure the exchange - bias field @xmath16 and the coercive field @xmath39 which are shown in next section . +      according to the model of meiklejohn - bean@xcite the exchange - bias field is given by @xmath40 figures [ hebxjac1800 ] ( @xmath32 ) and figure [ hebxjac2700 ] ( @xmath34 ) show our results to @xmath16 and @xmath39 as function of @xmath12 .",
    "as can be observed in the figure [ hebxjac1800 ] , the behavior of the @xmath16 as a function of the @xmath12 is linear for values up to approximately @xmath41 .",
    "note that this results are consistent with the theoretical result ( continuous line ) .",
    "+    however , in the figure [ hebxjac2700 ] , the expected linear behavior is obtained just for small values of the @xmath42 . among various conditions",
    "it is assumed in meiklejohn - bean s approach that the magnetization of the fm layer rotates rigidly .",
    "this condition is satisfied just for thin films . for thick films this condition is not fulfill since each fm layer present a different magnetization direction during the rotation .",
    "we can understand it looking at the eb effect mechanism .",
    "this effect is due to an effective field caused by the fm / afm interface .",
    "this effective field depends mainly on the direction of the spins and the exchange interactions on the interface .",
    "it lose strength on uppers layers ( far away from the interface ) due the low - range caracter of the exchange interaction .",
    "it means that each fm layer `` sees '' a different magnetic field .",
    "therefore the condition of rigid rotation can not be fulfill since the effective local field is not the same for all fm layers .",
    "this loosely rotation also explain the difference of the dependence of the coercive field behavior with @xmath12 on the applied field direction . for negative external field @xmath43",
    "is almost the same for all @xmath12 values . for the positive external field",
    "one can observe a dependence on @xmath43 with @xmath12 . once the effective field points on @xmath44-direction it will contribute ( compete ) with positive ( negative ) external field . for negative external field",
    "the magnetization of the uppers layers gyrates first than the lowers one . for thick films uppers layers",
    "domain the total magnetization , so the effect due the interface is negligible . on the other side , due the contribution of the fields , the effect",
    "due the interface can be easily propagate through the fm layer for positive external field .",
    "of course not as easily as on thin films .",
    "however in the limit of bulk materials one can overlook interface effects and eb no longer happens .",
    "+   +      in this section we show our results for the anisotropic heisenberg model .",
    "we set @xmath20 and varied the parameters @xmath12 , @xmath45 and @xmath14 .",
    "all results was obtained to a system of dimensions @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "we present in figure [ heb_x_jint ] our results of @xmath16 as function of @xmath12 to several values of @xmath45 and @xmath14 . in figure [ heb_x_jint_lambz0 ] ( figure [ heb_x_jint_lamby0 ] )",
    "we set @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath48 and @xmath50 ) and varied @xmath45 ( @xmath14 ) in order to study the anisotropy parallel ( perpendicular ) to the interface . for @xmath51 ( @xmath52 )",
    "we have an easy - plane anisotropy which favors the spin alignment in the xy - plane ( xz - plane ) . increasing @xmath45 ( @xmath14 ) this anisotropy tends to behavior like an easy - axis one in the @xmath53-direction ( @xmath54-direction ) .",
    "due the high uniaxial anisotropy on the substrate the afm moments are almost stuck on @xmath30-direction .",
    "so this direction dominates the interface exchange . between this and that the effective field at the interface have a high component on @xmath30-direction . during the process of reversing the magnetization",
    "was observed a small component of the effective field in other directions .",
    "the anisotropy is important in this process . in order to minimize the energy , if we have an easy - plane anisotropy this component can point in any direction of the plane . on the other hand , if we have an easy - axis anisotropy this component point in the direction of the easy - axis .",
    "the combination of the external field and the effective field determines the direction that the magnetics moments will precess around , during the inversion of the magnetization .",
    "this is a coupled process , when the spins precess it also change the axis of precession .",
    "we are going to talk about this precession on the next section .",
    "thereby there is no difference considering @xmath55 or @xmath56 easy - axis anisotropy , neither @xmath53 or @xmath54 as easy - axis anisotropy , as can be seen .",
    "we show in figure [ hc_x_jint ] our results for the coercive field @xmath43 .",
    "one can observe that , for intermediate @xmath12 values , @xmath43 decreases when anisotropy parameter @xmath45 or @xmath14 increases .",
    "we are going to explore this region on the next section .",
    "+     +    figure [ histereses_lamby_jint=0.5 ] shows the hysteresis loop to @xmath57 , @xmath20 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . how can be observed the hysteresis loop becomes asymmetrical in the ascending magnetization .",
    "the result ( not shown ) is similar when @xmath20 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 or @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath61 or @xmath64 , @xmath20 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the hysteresis loop becomes asymmetric when the value of the anisotropy is increased .",
    "analysing the figure [ histereses_new_lambz ] we can understand the magnetization behavior during the hysteresis loop .",
    "the black curve is the magnetization in the @xmath30-direction ( @xmath65 ) , the red curve is the magnetization in the @xmath53-direction ( @xmath66 ) and the dashed blue curve is the magnetization in the @xmath54-direction ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "figure [ histereses_new_lambz]@xmath68 shows the magnetization for a system without anisotropy in the @xmath55-plane and we can observe the coherent magnetization precession @xmath66 e @xmath67 for fields close to coercive field .",
    "we identified two distinct behavior which cause asymmetric loop .",
    "first , to @xmath69 ( figure [ histereses_new_lambz ] ) , the magnetization filed oscillates around the x - direction drawing a cone whose base radius increase proportionately to value of anisotropy .",
    "this change causes the magnetization to spiral in toward the effective field altering the precession rate .    ,",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the values of the anisotropy are shown in the figure . in this case",
    ", we change the anisotropy in the @xmath54-direction .",
    "the behavior is similar to the previous case but the precession is around the @xmath53-direction.,width=272 ]    second , to @xmath70 ( figure [ histereses_new_163_lambz ] ) , the component @xmath66 almost reaches the maximum value of saturation and and oscillates around the @xmath54-direction in the ascending magnetization before the point @xmath71 instead of oscillates around the @xmath30-direction as in the case of the figure [ histereses_new_lambz ] . in this case the dynamic behavior of the hysteresis loop can be separated in a precession around the @xmath30-direction ( region close to the point @xmath72 and @xmath73 of the figure [ histereses_new_163_lambz ] ) and a precession around the @xmath54-direction ( region @xmath74 of the figure [ histereses_new_163_lambz ] ) . in both cases , the change in coherent magnetization precession is responsible for asymmetric hysteresis loop @xcite .",
    "investigations has shown that the magnetic hysteresis can be either by coherent rotation or by the nucleation and growth of reverse domains ( domain - wall motion ) .",
    "when the hysteresis is a mixture those processes the symmetry of the hysteresis loop is broken . in our simulation",
    "this asymmetry comes just from anisotropy in the interface that change the local field in the afm / fm interface causing a variation of the direction of the axis about which the magnetic moment can rotate in the ascending magnetization . in the descending magnetization , the local field in the @xmath30-direction is strong enough to does not alter the precession .",
    "+ in the figure [ histereses_direcoes_lamby ] is shown the magnetization to an anisotropy in the @xmath54-direction . in this case , the precession is around the @xmath53-direction in the ascending magnetization and the magnetization behavior is similar to the previous cases . to @xmath75 and @xmath76",
    "the magnetic behavior is similar to that found in the figure [ histereses_direcoes_lambxy ] .",
    "we have made spins dynamics simulations considering an anisotropic exchange energy between fm / afm layers .",
    "we verified that a strong anisotropy along a given direction induces a torque on the magnetics moments that rotates the magnetization field directly toward the effective magnetic field affecting the precession rate , thereby causing the magnetization field to move directly into alignment with the effective field more and more rapidly until rotating them towards that direction .",
    "therefore , a magnetization rotation is induced by the addition of an anisotropy in the fm / afm interaction affecting the symmetry of the hysteresis loop .",
