    "quasi - local series expansions  expansions in the separation of two points @xmath1 and @xmath2  are a frequently used tool for calculations of fields on curved spacetimes . often , as a final step in the calculation , the coincidence limit , @xmath3 , is taken . in these cases , the precise convergence properties of the series is of little interest",
    ". however , there are cases where we would like the points to remain separated @xcite . in particular , we are motivated by the calculation of the _ quasilocal _ ( ql ) contribution to the scalar self - force @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) on a scalar particle , @xmath4 where @xmath5 ) describes the worldline of the particle .",
    "this requires a quasi - local expansion of the retarded green function , @xmath6 , which is a solution of the scalar wave equation with point source , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the curvature coupling constant and @xmath9 is the ricci scalar . as expression requires the green function for the points separated up to an amount @xmath10 along a world - line , it begs the question : how large can the separation of the points be before the series expansion is no longer a valid representation of the green function ?    to the authors knowledge , this question has not yet been quantitatively answered .",
    "it is well known that the hadamard parametrix for the green function ( upon which quasi - local calculations are based ) is valid provided @xmath1 and @xmath2 lie within a _ _ normal neighborhood _ _ and @xmath2 lie within a _ causal domain _  a _ convex normal neighbourhood _ with causality condition attached .",
    "this effectively requires that @xmath1 and @xmath2 be connected by a unique non - spacelike geodesic which stays within the causal domain .",
    "however , as we expect the term _ normal neighbourhood _ to be more familiar to the reader , we will use it throughout this paper , with implied assumptions of convexity and a causality condition.[def : causal domain ] ] @xcite .",
    "however , this does not necessarily guarantee that a series representation will be convergent everywhere within this normal neighborhood . in fact",
    ", we will show that the series is only convergent within a smaller region , the size of which is given by the _ circle of convergence _ of the series .",
    "however , this does not preclude the use of the quasi - local expansion to calculate the green function _ outside _ the circle of convergence ( but within the normal neighborhood ) . as we will show , pad resummation techniques , which have been extremely successful in other areas @xcite , are also effective in extending the series beyond its circle of convergence .    in this paper",
    ", we will focus in particular on calculating the green function for two spherically symmetric spacetimes : schwarzschild and nariai .",
    "the nariai spacetime  @xcite arises naturally from efforts to consider a simplified version of schwarzschild @xcite .",
    "it retains some of the key features of schwarzschild ( such as the presence of an unstable photon orbit and a similar effective radial potential which diminishes exponentially on one side ) , but frequently yields more straightforward calculations .",
    "this makes it an ideal testing ground for new methods which are later to be applied to the more complicated schwarzschild case . in the present work",
    ", we will use the line element of the static region of the nariai spacetime ( with cosmological constant @xmath11 and ricci scalar @xmath12 ) in the form @xmath13 where @xmath14,\\phi\\in [ 0,2\\pi)$ ] . in this form , it yields a wave equation with potential which is seen to closely resemble that of the schwarzschild metric , @xmath15    in sec .  [ sec : wkb ] we use an adaptation of the hadamard - wkb method developed by anderson and hu @xcite to efficiently calculate the coordinate series expansion of @xmath0 to very high order for both nariai and schwarzschild spacetimes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : convergence ] we use convergence tests to determine the radius of convergence of our series and show that , as expected , it lies within the convex normal neighborhood .",
    "we also estimate the local truncation error arising from truncating the series at a specific order . using the method of pad approximants",
    ", we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : pade ] how the domain of validity of the coordinate series can be extended beyond its radius of convergence to give an accurate representation of @xmath0 to within a small distance of the edge of the normal neighborhood .",
    "for the present quasilocal calculation , we need to consider the retarded green function only for the points @xmath1 and @xmath2 lying within a _ normal neighborhood_. this allows us to express the retarded green function in the hadamard parametrix @xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is analogous to the heaviside step - function ( i.e. @xmath18 when @xmath2 is in the causal past of @xmath1 , @xmath19 otherwise ) , @xmath20 is the standard dirac delta function , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are symmetric bi - scalars having the benefit that they are regular for @xmath3 , and @xmath23 is the synge @xcite world function ( i.e. , half the square of the geodesic distance ) . the term involving @xmath24 is only non - zero for null connected points whereas the quasi - local self - force calculation which motivates us requires the green function within the light - cone only .",
    "we will therefore only concern ourselves here with the calculation of the function @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are close together suggests that an expansion of @xmath0 in powers of the separation of the points , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the angular separation of the points , may give a good representation of the function within the quasi - local region .",
    "note that , as a result of the spherical symmetry of the spacetimes we will be considering , the expansion coefficients , @xmath27 , are only a function of the radial coordinate , @xmath28 .",
    "anderson and hu @xcite have developed a hadamard - wkb method for calculating these coefficients .",
    "they applied their method to the schwarzschild case and subsequently found the coefficients to @xmath29 order using the _ mathematica _ computer algebra system @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we adapt their method to allow for spacetimes of the nariai form , ( [ eq : nariai - le ] ) .",
    "in particular , we consider a class of spacetimes of the general form @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate , @xmath28 , and previously anderson and hu had set @xmath33 , but allowed @xmath34 and @xmath35 to be independent functions of @xmath28 .",

    "we have expressed @xmath0 as a power series in the separation of the points .",
    "this series will , in general , not be convergent for all point separations  the maximum point separation for which the series remains convergent will be given by its _ radius of convergence_. in this section , we explore the radius of convergence of the series in the nariai and schwarzschild spacetimes and use this as an estimate on the region of validity of our series .",
    "for simplicity , we will consider points separated only in the time direction so we will have a power series in @xmath154 , @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a real function of the radial coordinate , @xmath28 only .",

    "this gives us another estimate of the radius of convergence .",
    "again , in practice the last calculated term in the series will give a good estimate of the limit .",
    "it may appear that only the ( better behaved ) root test is necessary for estimating the radius of convergence of the series .",
    "however , extra insight can be gained from including both tests .",
    "this is because for the power series , the ratio test typically gives values _ increasing _ in @xmath92 while the root test gives values _ decreasing _ in @xmath92 , effectively giving lower and upper bounds on the radius of convergence .",
    "the hadamard parametrix for the retarded green function , ( [ eq : hadamard ] ) , is only guaranteed to be valid provided @xmath1 and @xmath2 are within a _ normal neighborhood _ ( see footnote [ def : causal domain ] ) .",
    "this arises from the fact that the hadamard parametrix involves synge s world function , @xmath163 , which is only defined for the points @xmath1 and @xmath2 separated by a _",

    "this turns out to not be the case , although it is still helpful to give consideration to @xmath164 as it should place an upper bound on the radius of convergence of the series .",
    "the normal neighborhood size will be given by the minimum time separation of the spacetime points such that they are connected by two geodesics .",
    "for typical cases of interest for self - force calculations there will be a particle following a time - like geodesic , so @xmath164 will be given by the minimum time taken by a null geodesic intersecting the particle s world - line twice .",
    "in typical black hole spacetimes , this geodesic will orbit the black hole once before re - intersecting the particle s world - line .",
    "another case of interest is that of the points @xmath1 and @xmath2 at constant spatial points , separated by a constant angle @xmath165 .",
    "initially , ( i.e. when @xmath166 ) , the points will be separated only by spacelike geodesics . after sufficient time has passed for a null geodesic to travel between the points ( going through and angle @xmath165 , they will be connected first by a null geodesic and subsequently by a sequence of unique timelike geodesics .",
    "since the geodesics are unique , @xmath164 will not be given by this _",
    "null geodesic time .",
    "rather , @xmath167 will be given by the time taken by the _",
    "second _ null geodesic ( passing through an angle @xmath168 ) .",
    "this subtle , but important , distinction will be clearly evident when we study specific cases in the next sections .",
    "knowledge of the radius of convergence alone does not give information about the accuracy of the series representation of @xmath0 .",

    "@xcite considered only the first two terms in the series when producing these estimates . since we now have a vastly larger number of terms available , it is worthwhile considering these again to determine the accuracy of the high order series .        allowing only the time separation of the points to change ,",
    "there are two cases of interest for the nariai spacetime :    1 .",
    "the static particle which has a normal neighborhood determined by the minimum coordinate time taken by a null geodesic circling the origin ( @xmath171 ) before returning .",

    "instead , it is the the next null geodesic , which goes through @xmath178 , that gives the normal neighborhood boundary .",
    "[ enum : static - nariai - angle ]    in both cases , the coordinate time taken by the null geodesic to travel between the points is given by @xcite @xmath179      for the nariai spacetime , the ratio test suffers from difficulties arising from zeros of the terms in the series .",

    "in this paper we have presented an extension of the hadamard - wkb method of anderson and hu @xcite to the nariai spacetime .",
    "we have also demonstrated the use of an alternative wkb method @xcite , which allows very high order terms in the taylor series to be calculated efficiently ( on a computer ) for schwarzschild , nariai and other spherically symmetric spacetimes .",
    "this allowed the series expansion of @xmath0 ( appearing in the hadamard parametrix of the green function ) to be computed to significantly higher order than was done previously in refs .",
    "these high order expansions facilitated an investigation of the convergence properties of the series .",
    "we also demonstrated the huge benefit of pad approximants to improving the domain and convergence of the series .",
    "this paper serves a dual purpose    1 .   to discuss the calculation of the quasilocal green function in nariai spacetime , as required by ref .",
    "2 .   to investigate the potential for applying the same techniques in the schwarzschild spacetime , with the goal of computing an accurate quasilocal green function for use in a matched expansion calculation of the self - force .",
    "we have found that , using pad approximants , it is possible compute the quasilocal green function in nariai spacetime to high accuracy to within a short distance of the normal neighborhood boundary . even without the use of pad approximants ,",
    "the taylor approximated series gives good accuracy within a large part of the quasilocal region .",
    "this gives confidence in their use for matched expansion calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite .    with regard to the schwarzschild case , we find that the quasilocal calculation of the green function is in good standing and should be usable in matched expansion calculations once techniques for computing the ` distant - past ' green function have been fully developed .",
    "both pad and taylor sequences remain convergent within a large part of the normal neighborhood .",
    "the use of pad approximants is not quite as successful as for the nariai case , but we remain optimistic that knowledge of the structure of the singularities in schwarzschild may allow for the use of _ improved _ pad approximants as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : padeschw ] .",
    "the orders of the series calculated for nariai ( @xmath265-th ) and schwarzschild ( @xmath266-nd ) were the maximum possible within a reasonable time ( @xmath267 day on a modern linux desktop ) .",
    "although these are considerably high order series , one may still wonder whether they are sufficiently high for matched expansion calculations .",
    "it is clear from sec .",
    "[ subsec : pade - convergence ] that the higher order terms only have a significant contribution near the radius of convergence ( for the taylor series ) or normal neighborhood boundary ( for the pad approximant ) . as the hadamard parametrix is only valid within the normal neighborhood , we consider the fact that the pad approximant is accurate to within a short distance of the normal neighborhood boundary to be confirmation that the series has been calculated to sufficiently high order ( in particular for the nariai case ) . additionally , within the matching region used in ref .",
    "@xcite for nariai , we clearly have computed a sufficient number of coefficients to give the green function to high accuracy .",
    "we can be optimistic that this is also the case for schwarzschild : the quasilocal series is accurate long after the time when the quasinormal mode sum is expected to be convergent ( @xmath268 , for the case of a static particle at @xmath256 considered here ) .",
    "our analysis has remained focused primarily on the case of one dimensional series .",
    "this was done for reasons of simplicity and clarity . for multi - dimensional series , one could re - express each of the coordinates in terms of a single parameter , as was done in sec .",
    "[ sec : convergence ] for the case of a circular geodesic in schwarzschild .",
    "alternatively , one could make use of the extension of the pad approximant to double and higher dimensional power series as developed by chisholm @xcite .",
