    "many gamma ray bursts ( grb s ) emit photons with very high observed energies ( @xmath1 1 mev ) .",
    "if the expansions of the bursts were non - relativistic , then the optical depth to the high energy photons would be so large that these photons could not be observed .",
    "this is the `` compactness problem '' ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "three basic processes contribute to the optical depth of high energy photons : ( a ) annihilation of pairs of photons into @xmath2 pairs ; ( b ) scattering of photons by either the @xmath3 or the @xmath4 created by the annihilation of photon pairs ; ( c ) scattering of photons by the electrons which are associated with baryons that may be present in the exploding ejecta .    since the optical depth from each of these three processes decreases with increasing lorentz factor ( @xmath0 ) of the expansion , the requirement that the burst be optically thin yields a lower limit on @xmath0 .",
    "in the following sections , we calculate the appropriate lower limits on @xmath0 .",
    "we then evaluate these lower limits for several bursts during which high energy photons were observed .",
    "it is assumed that the photon spectrum at high energies is a truncated power law .",
    "this can be regarded as an approximation to the high energy portion of the popular @xcite parameterization .",
    "thus , the spectrum ( i.e. the observed number of photons per unit time per unit area per unit energy ) is given by @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the observed photon energy , and , unless explicitly stated otherwise , all energies throughout this paper refer to their values in the observer s reference frame .",
    "the factor @xmath7 is a normalization factor .",
    "the exponent @xmath8 is typically between 2 and 3 ; a value greater than 2 implies that most of the energy is in low - energy photons .",
    "the energy @xmath9 is the highest energy for which photons were observed .",
    "very often , it is the energy above which the photon flux is too small to be detected @xcite .",
    "the spectrum turns over below @xmath10 , which is typically around 0.1 - 1 mev , although the exact value will not be needed in this paper .    of particular interest in the calculations below",
    "will be the total number of emitted photons which have energies greater than @xmath6 , if the burst emits for an observed time @xmath11 ( where @xmath11 is set by the variability timescale as seen in batse light curves , for example ) .",
    "this number , @xmath12 , is obtained by integrating the spectrum with respect to @xmath6 , and then multiplying by @xmath11 and @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the distance to the grb ) , yielding @xmath15 throughout this paper , we assume spherical symmetry ( at least within the beaming angle @xmath16 ) .",
    "in addition , for clarity , we neglect corrections due to cosmological redshift in the text .",
    "however , these corrections will be included in table  ( 1 ) which summarizes the main results .",
    "now , in the frame of the emitting material , where the photons are assumed to be roughly isotropic , a photon with energy @xmath17 can annihilate a second photon with energy larger than @xmath18 , yielding an electron - positron pair , where @xmath19 is the electron mass .",
    "when the energy of the second photon is around @xmath18 , then the cross - section for this process is approximately the thomson cross - section , @xmath20 .",
    "the cross - section falls off as a power - law of the annihilating photon energy if its energy is significantly larger than this value , and it is zero when its energy is below this value .",
    "the combination of these effects leads to an averaged cross section of about @xmath21 , assuming an @xmath22 spectrum @xcite .",
    "if the emitting material is moving towards the observer with a lorentz factor @xmath0 , then the photons are blueshifted by @xmath0 .",
    "thus , a photon with detected energy @xmath23 can only annihilate photons whose detected energies are larger than @xmath24 . since most of the photons are at small energies , the photon with the highest energy will be most susceptible to annihilation by other photons .",
    "thus , a lower limit on the lorentz factor can be obtained by requiring that the photon with energy @xmath9 will have optical depth smaller than unity .    to calculate this optical depth",
    ", we note that when the expansion is spherically symmetric ( at least within the beaming angle @xmath16 ) , the burst expands to a radial distance of about @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "this is true ( within numerical factors of order unity ) independent of the details of either the expansion scenario or of whether the emission is from internal or external shocks .",
    "now , if @xmath26 is defined as the energy of the photon which annihilates @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath27 , then there are @xmath28 photons which can annihilate the @xmath9 photon .",
    "thus , the optical depth is @xmath29    finally , inserting the expression for @xmath12 ( equation  [ eq : ngte ] ) into the above equation yields @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a dimensionless quantity which will appear again below .",
    "physically , it is the optical depth for a photon with energy @xmath32 in a mildly relativistic fireball ( i.e. with expansion speed @xmath33 , but with @xmath0 not much larger than unity ) .",
    "it is evaluated with observationally plausible values in equation  ( [ eq : numtauhat ] ) .",
    "the requirement that @xmath34 leads to the limit @xmath35    the interpretation of the above calculation can be facilitated by defining a characteristic photon energy , @xmath36 .",
    "this energy is defined as follows : the number of photons with energy greater than @xmath36 is such that , if each of these photons were assigned a cross - section equal to @xmath37 of the thomson cross - section , then they would be optically thick , i.e. , @xmath38 since the number of photons decreases with increasing energy , the requirement that the optical depth of the photon with energy @xmath9 be less than unity is simply the requirement that @xmath39from which equation  ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) follows directly .    table ( 1 ) summarizes the main results of this paper . in this table , the corrections due to cosmological redshift ( @xmath40 ) have been added .",
    "these corrections may be obtained by considering equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) .",
    "there are three redshift effects .",
    "( i ) in calculating @xmath28 , one needs to convert from the number of observed photons per unit area to the total number of photons at the source : instead of multiplying by @xmath13 , one should multiply by the appropriate surface area of a sphere which is centered at the burst , i.e. by @xmath41 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath42 is the luminosity distance .",
    "( ii ) due to cosmological time dilation , @xmath43 in the denominator of equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) .",
    "note that when ( i ) and ( ii ) are combined , the explicit factors of @xmath44 cancel , although there is still a redshift dependence through the luminosity distance .",
    "( iii ) due to the redshift of photon energies , the photon which annihilates the @xmath9 photon need only have an energy greater than @xmath45 in order to exceed the threshold for pair creation , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "when this is inserted this into @xmath28 in equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) , and combined with ( i ) and ( ii ) , the result is that @xmath47 .",
    "the physical mechanism presented in this section has been used in a number of previous papers to place a lower limit on the lorentz factor .",
    "however , in most of these papers , we found that the dependence of the optical depth on the lorentz factor was incorrect .",
    "this incorrect dependence results in a limit on @xmath0 which is too large by a factor of , typically , 2 or 3 .",
    "the correct dependence is given in equation  ( [ eq : tau1 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite considered the case when @xmath22 , and both obtained @xmath49 instead of the above scaling @xmath50 when @xmath22 .",
    "( see figure  ( 2 ) in the former reference and equation  ( 12 ) in the latter reference . )",
    "both of these papers used an incorrect expression for the dependence of the optical depth on the cross - section . in equation",
    "( 5 ) of @xcite , and in equation  ( 4 ) of @xcite , there should be an extra factor of @xmath51 multiplying the cross - section , where @xmath52 is the angle between annihilating photons .",
    "this extra factor is in addition to the dependence of the cross - section on @xmath52 .",
    "it accounts for the fact that , if two photons are traveling nearly parallel to each other , then they are unlikely to interact  in the limit that they are exactly parallel ( @xmath53 ) , they will never interact . since , approximately , @xmath54 , this accounts for the difference between these authors results and ours .",
    "@xcite presented an expression for the optical depth which is proportional to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the radius of the burst ( their equation  ( 41 ) , for example ) .",
    "this is in agreement with our expressions .",
    "however , they then claimed that @xmath56 is proportional to `` one or two powers '' of @xmath0 .",
    "they finally concluded , in their section  3.3 , that @xmath57 is more appropriate , yielding @xmath58 , and used that for their numerical results .",
    "however , as long as the burst is spherically symmetric within the angle @xmath16 , the only possibility is @xmath59 . while the numerical coefficient in this equation is uncertain , the exponent on @xmath0 is not .",
    "the relevant quantity is the number of photons per unit area at the source .",
    "one could also use @xmath57 , which is the transverse size seen by a given observer , in the denominator of equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) , but then only the photons emerging from the transverse area should be used in the numerator . the number of these photons is correspondingly reduced by @xmath60 , and our equation  ( [ eq : tau ] ) remains valid .",
    "in addition , we note that the dependences on cosmological redshift are incorrect in @xcite .",
    "the correct dependence for the optical depth is @xmath61 , assuming that it is the luminosity distance which is used .",
    "the resulting dependence on redshift of the lower limit on @xmath0 is as listed in table  ( 1 ) .",
    "our calculation is similar in spirit to that presented in the review article of @xcite ( his equation  ( 10 ) ) .",
    "however , when calculating the number of photons , he used the total number of photons emitted throughout the burst , whereas it is more appropriate to consider only the number of photons emitted during the variability timescale @xmath11 .",
    "after correcting for this , his estimate of the optical depth is similar to ours ( assuming @xmath8 in his equation  ( 10 ) is our @xmath62 , rather than as defined in his equation  ( 2 ) ) .    finally , @xcite calculated the optical depth , but in a scenario which is different than ours .",
    "specifically , they assumed that the emitting material consists of rigid blobs which move with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath0 , such as would be the case for a relativistically moving star .",
    "therefore , their limit depends only on the luminosity and not on the timescale of variability .",
    "they obtained @xmath63 , which is correct for their scenario , but which differs from our result by one power of @xmath0 .",
    "while the aforementioned papers presented more detailed scenarios for the expansion of the burst than presented here , differing scenarios would change our parameter @xmath64 by factors which are of order unity .",
    "however , the dependence of the minimum @xmath0 on @xmath64 is very weak@xmath0 is proportional to @xmath65 when @xmath22and thus these factors of order unity have little effect on the limit on @xmath0 .",
    "we prefer to leave the expansion scenario vague , largely because there are too many alternatives , each of which would produce a different factor of order unity in @xmath64 , and none of which would significantly affect the minimum @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , when we compared our result with the more detailed model of @xcite ( but with their @xmath0-dependence corrected ) , we found that our lower limit on @xmath0 exceeded theirs by less than around 30% for typical values of @xmath8 .      in the above calculation of the limit on @xmath0 ,",
    "two implicit assumptions have been made .",
    "first , it was assumed that @xmath66 , i.e. that the photon which annihilates the @xmath9 photon does not have an energy which is smaller than the low - energy break in the photon spectrum . in terms of observed quantities , this condition can be written as @xmath67 ( assuming that @xmath68 ) .",
    "it is easily satisfied for all of the bursts which we have considered ( except for the burst from which tev photons may have been detected ; see section  ( [ sec : obsres ] ) , below ) .",
    "if it is not satisfied , then the limit on @xmath0 depends on the behaviour of the photon spectrum below @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , if the number of photons is dominated by the high end of this part of the spectrum ( i.e. by photons whose energies are around @xmath10 ) , then the condition to be optically thin is @xmath69 ; this leads to @xmath70 .",
    "conversely , if the number of photons is dominated by the low end of this part of the spectrum , then the limit which has been calculated in this section in equation  ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) is applicable as long as it is this part of the spectrum which is used to calculate @xmath64 ; i.e. in equation  ( [ eq : tauhat ] ) , the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 should be defined by requiring that the spectrum below @xmath10 is @xmath71 .",
    "second , it was assumed that the photon with energy @xmath9 can annihilate a second photon whose energy is equal to its own ( i.e. @xmath72 ) , and thus that photons which annihilate the @xmath9 photon have a minimum energy which is less that @xmath9 .",
    "if , conversely , the lower limit on @xmath0 obtained in equation ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) does not satisfy this constraint ( i.e. if @xmath73 ) , then the @xmath9 photon can only annihilate photons with energies larger than itself . since we do not observe these photons , we can only speculate about their existence .",
    "we consider two alternatives .",
    "a first alternative is that the grb does not produce any photons whose energies would be observed to be larger than @xmath9 ( independent of any optical depth considerations ) .",
    "this alternative implies that the limit on the lorentz factor is @xmath74 however , it seems unlikely that this limit would be valid for most bursts : since @xmath9 is often the energy above which the extrapolated photon flux would be too small to be observed , it would be overly coincidental if @xmath9 were also the energy above which the intrinsic photon spectrum ( i.e. before optical depth considerations ) were cut off .",
    "a second alternative is that this intrinsic spectrum has no cutoff at very high energies .",
    "we consider this to be the more realistic of the two alternatives . in this case",
    ", the limit calculated previously in equation  ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) would be valid .",
    "however , if this second alternative is true , then there is a more stringent bound on @xmath0 which will be discussed in the following section .",
    "the photons which annihilate each other produce electron - positron pairs .",
    "these pairs can , in turn , compton scatter other photons .",
    "now , we can approximate the number of electron - positron pairs by the number of photons which both ( i ) have energy greater than @xmath76 , sufficient to `` self - annihilate '' ; and ( ii ) are optically thick to pair creation . the burst will be optically thin if the number of these pairs is smaller than @xmath77 ( as defined in equation  [ eq : ethick ] ) .",
    "equivalently , the burst will be optically thin if @xmath78 , i.e. if @xmath79 where @xmath64 has been defined in equation ( [ eq : tauhat ] ) . for simplicity , in the above calculation we implicitly took the compton cross - section to be 11/180 @xmath20 , instead of the correct value @xmath20 .",
    "when we use this correct value , the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : gamma2 ] ) is increased by the numerical factor @xmath80 , a correction which we will ignore .    in table",
    "( 1 ) , the dependence of @xmath81 on cosmological redshift is obtained by replacing @xmath0 by @xmath82 .",
    "finally , we note that if limit  b did not hold , then the burst would be optically thick to all photons , and not just to those photons which have high energies .",
    "limit  a is the requirement that @xmath83 ; limit  b is the requirement that @xmath84 .",
    "thus , limit  b is more important than limit  a if @xmath85 ( or , equivalently , @xmath86 ) .",
    "this is simply the requirement that the photon with energy @xmath9 can not self - annihilate . in terms of observed quantities ,",
    "this condition that limit  b be more important than limit  a may be written as @xmath87 .",
    "finally , it should be emphasized that limit  b implicitly assumes that the intrinsic photon spectrum ( before optical depth considerations ) can be extrapolated to the energy which corresponds to @xmath81 .",
    "although @xmath81 is unobservable when limit  b is applicable , we believe that this assumption is reasonable .",
    "if there are baryons in the grb , then a third limit on @xmath0 may be obtained by considering the scattering of photons by electrons which are associated with these baryons .",
    "several previous papers have used this limit ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "our calculation assumes that the energy in photons is less than @xmath0 times the baryon rest mass energy , which is valid in scenarios where the baryons are cold ( such as internal shock models ) .",
    "however , this assumption is not valid in some scenarios , such as external shock models where the electrons are heated to equipartition with the baryons  in which case the energy in photons is @xmath88 times the baryon rest mass energy .",
    "in addition , for these models , one must use the klein - nishina cross - section instead of the thomson cross - section which we use below .",
    "thus , the validity of this limit is restricted .",
    "the optical depth due to compton scattering off of the electrons which are associated with baryons is , with similar assumptions which led to equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the number of baryons .",
    "now , a lower limit on @xmath90 can be obtained when the total energy in photons is less than the kinetic energy of the baryons , i.e. @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the proton mass . with equation ( [ eq : ngte ] ) for @xmath12 ,",
    "the optical depth due to the minimum number of baryons is @xmath93 .    to compare with limit  b ( equation  [ eq : gamma2 ] )",
    ", we write the resulting limit on @xmath0 as follows : @xmath94^{1\\over 5}$ ] . however , since @xmath95 is typically very small ( around @xmath96 or @xmath97 ) , the quantity in square brackets is typically smaller than unity , and limit  c can be ignored .",
    "table  ( 2 ) lists the relevant limits for a number of bursts . the quantity @xmath64 which is in the table has been defined in equation ( [ eq : tauhat ] ) .",
    "numerically , @xmath98 \\ , \\label{eq : numtauhat}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the observed number of photons per second per @xmath100 per mev at the energy of 1 mev , i.e. @xmath101 mev@xmath102 sec @xmath100 .",
    "both limit  a and limit  b are listed in the table . clearly ,",
    "only the larger limit is relevant ; it is listed in boldface .",
    "we re - emphasize that it is being assumed that the intrinsic photon spectrum ( i.e. before optical depth effects ) can be extrapolated to very high energies . in particular , when limit  b is relevant , the photon spectrum is extrapolated to @xmath103 . however , when limit  a is relevant , the spectrum need not be extrapolated past the observed energy @xmath9 .    from the first set of seven bursts in table  ( 2 ) , very high energy photons were observed .",
    "the parameters for the first six of these bursts were tabulated in @xcite .",
    "the data originally come from egret , except for grb  910601 , where comptel data give stronger constraints . from bursts with measured redshifts ,",
    "the redshift @xmath104 is a plausible estimate .",
    "this corresponds to a luminosity distance of @xmath105 gpc ( when @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 km sec@xmath109 mpc@xmath109 , which are the generally accepted values for the cosmological parameters ) . note that the luminosity distance is nearly proportional to @xmath110",
    "this implies that both limit a and limit b are roughly proportional to @xmath44 ; and , for example , the limits would be doubled if the bursts had @xmath111 .",
    "we set the variability time @xmath112 sec , because batse detects variability down to this timescale , which is comparable to batse s resolution time .",
    "the seventh burst , grb  990123 , had its redshift measured to be @xmath113 , which corresponds to a luminosity distance of 11.8 gpc .    for the remainder of the bursts in table  ( 2 ) , not many high energy photons were observed . to estimate the quantity @xmath99 in equation ( [ eq : numtauhat ] )",
    ", we use batse data .",
    "in particular , defining @xmath114 as the fluence in photons with energy greater than 300 kev , and @xmath115 as the duration of the burst during which 50% of the fluence is observed , we use the approximation @xmath116    the middle set of bursts in table  ( 2 ) are three grb s which had measured redshifts , and which had relatively large total energies .",
    "in addition to the expression for @xmath99 above , we used @xmath112 sec and @xmath117 . with this value of @xmath9 ,",
    "it is possible that these bursts are non - relativistic , if one assumes that the intrinsic photon spectrum is cut off above @xmath9 .",
    "nonetheless , under the reasonable assumption that the intrinsic photon spectrum continues to very high energies , then the resulting limits are as listed in table  ( 2 ) for two possible values of @xmath8 .",
    "note that limit  b is always more significant than limit  a for these bursts , mainly due to the low assumed value of @xmath9 .",
    "the final two grb s have unusual properties .",
    "the first of these is grb  980425 , which was a nearby low - energy burst ; it was nearly coincident with the supernova sn  1998bw @xcite .",
    "we evaluate @xmath64 for this burst using the same method as was used in the previous three bursts with redshifts . however , we use @xmath118 sec because the light curve for this burst was smooth on timescales smaller than this .",
    "the second of the unusual bursts is grb  970417a , from which tev photons may have been detected @xcite .",
    "we use batse data , together with @xmath112 sec and @xmath119 .",
    "this value for @xmath40 is an upper limit based on the opacity due to starlight @xcite .",
    "then , for this burst , @xmath120 , where @xmath121 . since , in addition , the photon spectrum is cut off below @xmath10 , the limit on @xmath0 is obtained by considering all of the photons in the burst .",
    "the requirement on the lorentz factor is thus @xmath122 ( section  [ sec : dota ] ) .",
    "the resulting limit on @xmath0 is listed in table  ( 2 ) . in our calculation for this burst ,",
    "we assume that the optical depth is below unity for all photon energies up to tev .",
    "we derived three limits on the lorentz factor @xmath0 , based on the requirement that grb s be optically thin .",
    "our order of magnitude calculations are unaffected by the details of the scenario and our lower limits apply to internal as well as external shocks , assuming spherical symmetry within an opening angle of @xmath16 .",
    "limit  a was obtained by considering the annihilation of pairs of photons ; limit  b was obtained by considering the scattering of photons by pair - created e@xmath75 ; limit  c was obtained by considering the scattering of photons by electrons which are associated with baryons .",
    "it was shown that , as long as the intrinsic photon spectrum ( i.e. before optical depth effects ) can be extrapolated to very high energies , limit  c is nearly always less important than limit  b. table  ( 1 ) summarizes the results for limits  a and  b.    we evaluated limits  a and  b for a few selected bursts ( see table  2 ) .",
    "our numerical results for limit  a are not very different from the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "while correcting their dependence of optical depth on lorentz factor reduced the lower limit on @xmath0 by a factor of a few , our use of larger distances ( because of recent redshift measurements ) partially compensated for this .    with the anticipated launch of the gamma ray large area space telescope ( glast ) in 2005 , the limits presented in this paper",
    "may be improved .",
    "since cut - offs in the photon spectrum at high energies have usually not been observed , the values of @xmath9 which we have used in this paper are lower limits , set by instrumental sensitivity .",
    "glast will be able to detect photons up to 300 gev , with sensitivity much better than that of egret ( http://glast.stanford.edu/mission.html ) .",
    "if glast does not observe a cut - off , then compared with our assumed value for the maximum observed energy photon from bursts with measured resdshifts ( i.e. @xmath117 ) , @xmath9 would be increased by a factor of nearly @xmath123 . since our limit a is proportional to @xmath124 ( when @xmath22 ) , our limits could be increased by a factor of around 10 , yielding lower limits on lorentz factors of nearly 1000"
