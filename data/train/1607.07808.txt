    "ferromagnetic hetero - structures ( fmh ) are integral spintronic elements that play a critical role in various spin transport phenomena .",
    "fmh have been used as a platform for practical spintronic devices , such as spin - hall @xcite and spin - orbit - based memories @xcite , anomalous hall , and topological hall - based sensors @xcite . in such systems ,",
    "the spin density can be detected by many methods , such as magneto - optic kerr effect ( moke ) @xcite , ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) @xcite , and electrical measurements @xcite . in the characterization of the fmh devices , a spatial resolution of the spin distribution up to",
    "the order of @xmath0 has been achieved by moke @xcite , and up to sub-@xmath0 using magnetic force microscopy ( mfm ) @xcite . however , with the advancement of device fabrication at nanoscale , it requires detection and imaging technique that can provide nanoscale resolution as well as high sensitivity .",
    "recently , the nitrogen - vacancy centers ( nvc s ) in diamond have been employed as extremely sensitive vector magnetic field sensors operating at room temperature and capable of nanoscale spatial resolution @xcite .",
    "nvc s are atomic - scale defects which are formed either naturally or by implantation , using high - energy nitrogen ion beam @xcite , annealing @xcite , and nitrogen doping @xcite .",
    "the nvc spin states are split under the influence of an external magnetic field .",
    "such spin - splitting selectively suppresses optical fluorescence , making it possible to achieve measurements of the magnetic field through optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) @xcite .    in conventional magnetometry experiments",
    "@xcite , the distance between the nvc and the detected magnetic moment @xmath1 of an electron is large enough so that only the zeeman effect has to be considered .",
    "the zeeman effect arises from dipole - dipole interaction which is long range by nature . in sensing the magnetic field profile ,",
    "a higher spatial resolution can be achieved if the sensor is brought closer to the detected system @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it has been recently shown that the diamond could be reduced to nanometer scale @xcite and an nvc could be positioned at a distance of @xmath2 nm below the diamond surface @xcite , thus minimizing the separation between the nvc sensor and the target spin .",
    "however , when the sensor is positioned very close to the sample , the electron in nvc can interact with the electron in the sample through the exchange mechanism , in addition to the usual dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "in contrast to the dipole interaction , the exchange effect is short range because it depends on the overlap of the nvc wavefunction with that of the magnetic moment @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is important to explore the full nature of electron - electron interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ , both the dipole coupling and the exchange coupling , when the nvc is placed in close proximity to the fhm .",
    "recently , the exchange interaction between the ferromagnetic tip and the magnetic sample has also been considered in magnetic exchange force microscopy ( mexfm ) @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , the exchange interaction between proximal nvc spins and fmh spins , has not been considered in nv - based magnetometry .",
    "this study will thus be highly relevant for advancing nv - based magnetometry towards its ultimate spatial resolution .",

    ", the depletion region can be reduced by increasing the doping concentration or by applying gate voltage across the fmh / diamond interface @xcite .",
    "given the fmh / nvc distance achievable by today s technology of about 1 - 2 nm , a barrier height ( with respect to the fermi level of fmh ) of less than 0.5 ev will already result in the exchange energy surpassing the magnetic energy ( see fig .",

    "both magnetic and exchange energies are estimated to be at the order of a few hundred mhz of the 2.87 ghz zero field splitting of the nvc . for separation distance more than 2 nm , the exchange energy rapidly decreases to zero , at a much faster rate than the dipole coupling energy .",
    "this is consistent with prevailing experimental focus on using only the magnetic energy in describing the results of the magnetometry experiments . considering ongoing progress in development of etching and lithography tools which become increasingly capable of producing hetero - structures with small distances between nvc and the interface",

    ", the exchange coupling can exist between any pair of nvc - fmh spins .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the exchange coupling quickly diminishes as the distance increases .",
    "therefore , the exchange coupling between nvc spin and its nearest fmh spin takes the dominant role . assuming the spin distribution in fmh layer is @xmath3 , and a nvc is placed at position @xmath95 , the total exchange energy is then @xmath96 , with @xmath97 , which means that the exchange coupling between nvc and fmh is mainly dependent on the local spin density at the nvc position",
    "however , the dipole field is significant even at long range , and the zeeman splitting of the nvc ground state is induced by the combined exchange and dipole field .",
    "in contrast to the exchange field , the total dipole field induced by the fmh layer on the nv spin is the sum @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the dipole field induced by fmh spin @xmath100 .",
    "the dipole field is dependent on the distance @xmath85 between nvc and fmh layer for a certain nvc orientation .",
    "meanwhile , the exchange coupling @xmath101 is not only dependent on the nvc - fmh distance @xmath102 , but also on properties of the fmh / diamond junction such as barrier potential ( @xmath52 ) and depletion width ( @xmath54 ) , see figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "this enables us to tune the exchange coupling and the exchange field by modifying the barrier potential or depletion width , but still keeping the dipole field constant .",
    "based on the above , we will now show that the spin distribution in fmh layer can be read out locally .",
