    "dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies of the local group are believed to be among the most dark matter dominated objects in the universe .",
    "their masses have important implications for the problem of the missing satellites .",
    "the carina , fornax , sculptor and sextans dsph galaxies , all known for a few decades , are classic , well studied examples of this family of stellar systems . although generally believed to be strongly dark matter dominated , their actual mass - to - light ratios are still very uncertain . while the tidal origin of their large velocity dispersions is almost certainly ruled out , their formation scenarios are still debatable .",
    "the accuracy of mass determinations of dsph galaxies can only be improved by increasing the size of kinematic samples used in the modelling .",
    "recently , new measurements of radial velocities for the four dwarfs were published by walker , mateo & olszewski ( 2008a ) , significantly increasing the number of stars with measured velocities ( by an order of magnitude in the case of fornax ) . in this letter",
    "we use these data to constrain the total mass and velocity anisotropy of the dwarfs .",
    "our method relies on the modelling of the velocity moments , the dispersion and kurtosis of the line - of - sight velocity distribution by solutions of the jeans equations ( okas 2002 ; okas , mamon & prada 2005 ) .",
    "an underlying assumption of such an analysis is that in spite of being tidally affected by the gravitational field of the milky way the dwarfs can still be approximated as self - gravitating , virialized systems . an important first step in the analysis is to use a reliable procedure for the removal of interlopers : the unbound stars from the milky way and the tidal tails of the dwarfs .",
    "we will show that for all the dwarfs the data are well reproduced by models where mass traces light and the velocity anisotropy parameter is constant with radius .    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 8.3 cm    all the assumptions adopted here have been verified by @xmath1-body simulations performed within the framework of the tidal stirring scenario ( mayer et al .",
    "such simulations show that dsph galaxies form effectively from initial stellar disks embedded in dark matter haloes by tidal interactions .",
    "the products of such evolution have mass - to - light profiles and anisotropy parameters almost constant with radius ( klimentowski et al . 2007 ; mayer et al .",
    "2007 ) . in spite of losing considerable fractions of mass by tidal forces ,",
    "such objects are still gravitationally bound and their velocity moments can be reliably reproduced by equilibrium models yielding realistic mass and anisotropy estimates ( klimentowski et al .",
    "2007 ; okas et al . 2008 ) . since tidal tails in the immediate vicinity of the dwarfs",
    "are most likely oriented along the line of sight and are quite dense ( klimentowski et al .",
    "2008 ) , we can however expect significant contamination of kinematic samples by unbound stars .",
    "still , such contamination can be effectively removed by an iterative procedure based on a maximum velocity available to a given star ( den hartog & katgert 1996 ; klimentowski et al . 2007 ; wojtak et al .",
    "figure  [ vr ] presents the kinematic data sets for the four dwarfs from walker et al .",
    "( 2008a ) . in each panel the dots correspond to heliocentric velocities of the stars as a function of their distance from the galaxy centre .",
    "the positions of the centres and the distances of the dwarfs were adopted from mateo ( 1998 ) except for fornax , where a newer estimate of the centre by walcher et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , which agrees well with the one of coleman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , was used .",
    "all these values are listed in table  [ adopted ] . the velocity range shown in fig .",
    "[ vr ] corresponds to a cut - off of about @xmath2 with respect to the mean velocity of the galaxy , where @xmath3 is the velocity dispersion in the centre , where the contamination is low .",
    "colour - coded in the figure are the results of the interloper removal scheme applied to the data .",
    "the procedure , first proposed by den hartog & katgert ( 1996 ) and applied to galaxy clusters , relies on rejecting stars with velocity exceeding the maximum velocity available to a star at a given projected distance from the centre .",
    "the maximum velocity is estimated by assuming that the star is on a circular orbit with velocity @xmath4^{1/2}$ ] or falling freely in the galaxy s potential with velocity @xmath5 . the mass profile needed for the calculation of the velocities",
    "is estimated in each iteration using the standard mass estimator @xmath6 derived from the virial theorem ( heisler , tremaine & bahcall 1985 ) .",
    "the procedure has been tested on mock data sets generated from @xmath1-body simulations and shown to effectively remove most of unbound stars while rejecting very few bound ones ( klimentowski et al .",
    "2007 ; wojtak et al . 2007 ) .",
    "note that the efficiency of the procedure is not restricted to systems where mass follows light and it does not impose such models ( klimentowski et al . 2007 ; snchez - conde et al . 2007 ) .",
    "the results of the application of the procedure to the present data are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vr ] so that the blue dots show the stars accepted in the final iteration while the red ones indicate those rejected by the procedure . within the velocity and distance ranges shown in the figure we identified 700 , 2445 , 1281 and 412 members respectively for carina , fornax , sculptor and sextans . in the following analysis we will only use these cleaned ( blue ) samples .",
    "we have verified that the procedure does not depend on the initial velocity cut - off , i.e. identical final samples are obtained if the initial velocity cut - off is @xmath7 or @xmath8 with respect to the galaxy mean .    note that our dynamical interloper removal scheme is more restrictive ( i.e. it rejects more stars ) than the method of sample selection based on metallicity indicators discussed by walker et al .",
    "( 2008b ) .",
    "the latter is intended to identify all the present as well as former stellar members of the dwarf so in principle it rejects only the contamination from the milky way stars . on the other hand",
    ", our scheme rejects also the stars that were stripped from the dwarf due to tidal interactions , which now populate the tidal tails and are no longer good tracers of the dwarf galaxy potential .    in order to calculate the velocity moments we binned the data so that we had 70 , 200 , 100 and 40 stars per bin respectively for carina , fornax , sculptor and sextans . from the data grouped in this way , the profiles of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath9 and kurtosis @xmath10 were calculated using standard unbiased estimators of these moments ( see okas et al .",
    "the dispersion data points @xmath9 were assigned sampling errors of size @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of stars per bin . instead of kurtosis",
    "@xmath13 we use the kurtosis - like variable @xmath14 which has a gaussian sampling distribution contrary to the kurtosis @xmath13 .",
    "the values of @xmath15 were obtained with the correction of the standard estimator of kurtosis @xmath16 by the bias due to the low number of stars per bin so that @xmath17 where @xmath18 and 2.93 respectively for @xmath19 and 200 .",
    "the sampling errors of @xmath15 are @xmath20 and 0.00914 for the same values of @xmath12 .",
    "these numerical values were estimated by monte carlo sampling of data from near - gaussian distribution similar to the one described in the appendix of okas & mamon ( 2003 ) .",
    "the profiles of the velocity moments obtained for the data cleaned of interlopers ( blue dots in fig .",
    "[ vr ] ) are plotted together with their sampling errors in figs .",
    "[ vd ] ( velocity dispersion ) and [ vk ] ( kurtosis ) .",
    "we can see that they are all slowly decreasing with radius so our method of member selection leads to significantly different dispersion profiles than in the case where no such dynamical scheme is applied and the profiles turn out to be flat ( walker et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "= 8.3 cm    = 8.3 cm",
    "the data shown in figs .  [ vd ] and [ vk ] were modelled by adjusting the projected solutions of the jeans equations ( see okas 2002 ; okas et al .",
    "2005 ) assuming that the mass distribution follows the light and the anisotropy parameter @xmath21 is constant with radius .",
    "the shape parameters of the distribution of light ( i.e. the srsic radius @xmath22 and the srsic parameter @xmath23 ) and the total apparent magnitude were adopted from irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) and are listed in table  [ adopted ] .",
    "the table also gives the total luminosity for each galaxy , adjusted to the distances adopted here .",
    "the listed errors in total luminosity include the errors in apparent magnitude as well as distance .",
    "the lines plotted in figs .  [ vd ] and [ vk ] show the best - fitting solutions of the jeans equations .",
    "the red lines ( for fornax not visible as overplotted by the blue line ) correspond to the best models when only the dispersion was fitted .",

    "( 2007 ) from the analysis of velocity dispersion using similar data sets , but with different member selection and assuming nfw dark matter profiles .",
    "as already mentioned , their less restrictive member selection method leads to flat velocity dispersion profiles which indeed can be reproduced by extended dark matter haloes .",
    "our results agree however with the masses they estimate for the inner parts of the dwarfs .    in order to illustrate the differences in our approaches to interloper rejection we performed a similar modelling for fornax as before but on a sample selected with the traditional constant velocity cut - off of @xmath60 km s@xmath61 with respect to the galaxy mean velocity .",
    "as expected , the velocity dispersion and kurtosis profiles are now flat and constant @xmath62 models do not provide very good fits .",
    "when fitting only the dispersion the best - fitting parameters are @xmath63m@xmath64 ( @xmath65m@xmath29l@xmath64 ) , @xmath66 with @xmath67 , when fitting both dispersion and kurtosis we find @xmath68m@xmath64 ( @xmath69m@xmath29l@xmath64 ) , @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "the differences with our estimates in table  [ fitted ] are not very large , especially when both moments are fitted .",
    "this is due to the fact that contamination increases the values of both dispersion and kurtosis while their dependence on anisotropy is different ( see the discussion in okas et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "it may seem that the number of stars we rejected as interlopers ( see fig .",
    "[ vr ] ) is large , especially for fornax .",
    "note however , that significant contamination is expected for many of the dwarfs since for realistic , eccentric , cosmologically motivated orbits their tidal tails are oriented approximately towards the milky way ( so towards the observer ) for almost all positions along the orbit except close to the pericentre , where the dwarfs spend only a small fraction of the orbital period ( klimentowski et al .",
    "the new kinematic data sets for the carina , fornax , sculptor and sextans allowed us to determine the mass of the dwarfs with unprecedented precision . in the case of fornax , with the largest sample , the mass is determined with better than 5 percent accuracy .",
    "this is due to the very small sampling errors of velocity moments .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios are much worse constrained because of rather large errors in the determination of luminosity . in spite of these",
    ", a dichotomy is seen among the studied dwarfs : while fornax and sculptor have a mass - to - light of the order of 10 solar units , carina and sextans have significantly higher values of 66 and 97 .",
    "although these high values still bear an error of about 50 percent , they can not be reconciled with any stellar population values thus signifying that these two dwarfs are highly dark matter dominated and similar in this respect to the draco dwarf ( okas et al . 2005 ) .    our mass and mass - to - light determination for carina agrees within errors with previous estimates obtained from the total velocity dispersion by muoz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and mateo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) if we take into account their different assumptions about the parameters of the luminosity distribution . for fornax",
    "the present estimates are somewhat lower than the previous ones ( walker et al .",
    "2006a ; klimentowski et al .",
    "2007 ; okas , klimentowski & wojtak 2007 ) .",
    "okas et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found @xmath62 of the order of 11 and isotropic orbits from a similar analysis as presented here but based on @xmath72 stars from walker et al .",
    "( 2006a ) , a number an order of magnitude smaller than presently available .",
    "the anisotropy determined here is weakly tangential ; note however that although the orbits are still quite close to isotropic , isotropy is excluded at @xmath8 level .    in the case of sculptor",
    "our @xmath62 estimate is an order of magnitude lower than the most recent one by battaglia et al .",
    "( 2008 ) who find @xmath73 at the distance of 1.8 kpc , but agrees well with earlier estimates by queloz , dubath & pasquini ( 1995 ) and armandroff & da costa ( 1986 ) .",
    "the reason for this large discrepancy lies in the selection of the data as well as in models used .",
    "note that the fraction of stars discarded by our interloper removal scheme ( fig .",
    "[ vr ] ) is large in the case of sculptor so the data are highly contaminated leading to larger velocity dispersion found by battaglia et al .",
    "the contamination probably comes from the tidal tails of the dwarf : as discussed by coleman , da costa & bland - hawthorn ( 2005 ) the tails are not visible in photometric studies so they must be oriented along the line of sight thus contributing significantly to the kinematics ( klimentowski et al .",
    "in addition , the data sample of battaglia et al . extends to larger distances from the centre of the dwarf than the one studied here , making the contamination even more probable .",
    "this manifests itself in the flat rather than decreasing velocity dispersion profile suggesting the presence of an extended dark matter halo with a slowly decreasing density profile that can indeed lead to the inference of large @xmath62 values at large distances .",
    "the mass - to - light ratio for sextans estimated from the total velocity dispersion by hargreaves et al . ( 1994 ) is 94 solar units ( when translated to our adopted luminosity ) in perfect agreement with our value of 97 .",
    "these values are significantly higher than those estimated by suntzeff et al .",
    "( 1993 ) who find @xmath62 of the order of @xmath74 .",
    "we thus confirm that this dwarf is indeed very strongly dark matter dominated .",
    "our determined mass also agrees with the rough estimate by kleyna et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who found the mass in the range @xmath75m@xmath64 assuming isotropic orbits in the jeans equation . in agreement with walker et al .",
    "( 2006b ) we find however no evidence for the presence of a cold kinematic core in sextans claimed by kleyna et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "we conclude that for all four dwarfs the data are satisfactorily reproduced by models where mass traces light and the anisotropy is close to zero or weakly tangential .",
    "both these findings yield support to the formation scenarios based on the so - called tidal stirring model ( mayer et al .",
    "the model predicts that an extended dark matter halo initially present in a dwarf galaxy is strongly stripped due to tidal interactions with the milky way ( kazantzidis et al . 2004 ) and the final product we see today should have dark matter distributed in a similar way as the stars up to distances where the tidal tails start to be visible ( klimentowski et al .",
    "2007 ; mayer et al .",
    "the stellar orbits are expected to be weakly tangential , e.g. in the simulation of klimentowski et al .",
    "( 2007 ) the final stage has mean @xmath76 ( see also their fig .",
    "4 ) , of the same order as the values estimated here .",
    "the tidal scenario also predicts that some remnant rotation could be expected in the dwarfs at present , however , contrary to the previous claims e.g. for carina ( muoz et al .",
    "2006 ) and sculptor ( battaglia et al . 2008 ) no significant rotation is found in the data studied here .",
