    "it is well - established that the universe is currently undergoing accelerated cosmological expansion .",
    "observational evidence for the accelerated expansion comes from supernova type ia ( snia ) apparent magnitude measurements as a function of redshift @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy data @xcite combined with low estimates of the cosmological mass density @xcite , and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) peak length scale estimates @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism responsible for this accelerated expansion is not yet well characterized .",
    "the `` standard '' general relativistic model of cosmology has an energy budget that is currently dominated by far by dark energy , a negative - pressure substance that powers the accelerated expansion .",
    "( another possibility is that the above observations are a manifestation of the breakdown of general relativity on large cosmological length scales . in this paper",
    "we assume that general relativity provides an adequate description of gravitation on cosmological length scales . )",
    "dark energy can vary weakly in space and evolve slowly in time , though current data are consistent with it being a cosmological constant . for recent reviews see @xcite .",
    "there are many dark energy models under discussion ( for recent discussions see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the current `` standard '' model is the @xmath0cdm model @xcite where the accelerated cosmological expansion is powered by einstein s cosmological constant , @xmath0 , a spatially homogeneous fluid with equation of state parameter @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the fluid pressure and energy density ) . in this model",
    "the cosmological energy budget is dominated by far by @xmath3 , with cold dark matter ( cdm ) being the second largest contributor .",
    "the @xmath0cdm model provides a reasonable fit to most observational constraints , although the `` standard '' cdm structure formation model might be in some observational trouble ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the @xmath0cdm model raises some puzzling conceptual questions .    if the dark energy density slowly decreased in time ( rather than remaining constant like @xmath3 ) ,",
    "the energy densities of dark energy and nonrelativistic matter ( cdm and baryons ) would remain comparable for a longer period of time , and so alleviate what has become known as the @xmath0cdm coincidence puzzle .",
    "in addition , a slowly decreasing effective dark energy density , based on a more fundamental physics model that is applicable at an energy density scale much larger than an mev , could result in the current observed dark energy density scale of order an mev through gradual decrease over the long lifetime of the universe , another unexplained feature in the context of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "thus a slowly decreasing dark energy density could resolve some of the puzzles of the @xmath0cdm model .",
    "the xcdm parametrization is often used to describe a slowly decreasing dark energy density . in this parametrization",
    "the dark energy is modeled as a spatially homogenous ( @xmath4 ) fluid with an equation of state parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the pressure and energy density of the @xmath4-fluid .",
    "when @xmath9 , the xcdm parametrization reduces to the complete and consistent @xmath0cdm model .",
    "for any other value of @xmath10 the xcdm parametrization is incomplete as it can not describe spatial inhomogeneities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here we study the xcdm parametrization only in the spatially - flat cosmological case .    the @xmath11cdm model  in which dark energy is modelled as a scalar field @xmath11 with a gradually decreasing ( in @xmath11 ) potential energy density @xmath12 ",
    "is the simplest complete and consistent model of a slowly decreasing ( in time ) dark energy density . here",
    "we focus on an inverse power - law potential energy density @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a nonnegative constant .",
    "when @xmath15 the @xmath11cdm model reduces to the corresponding @xmath0cdm case . here",
    "we only consider the spatially - flat @xmath11cdm cosmological model .",
    "it has been known for some time that a spatially - flat @xmath0cdm model with current energy budget dominated by a constant @xmath0 is largely consistent with most observational constraints ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "sneia , cmb , and bao measurements mentioned above indicate that we live in a spatially - flat @xmath0cdm model with nonrelativistic matter contributing a little less than 30 % of the current cosmological energy budget , with the remaining slightly more than 70 % contributed by a cosmological constant .",
    "these three sets of data carry by far the most weight when determining constraints on models and cosmological parameters",
    ".    future data from space missions will significantly tighten the constraints ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , at present , it is important to determine independent constraints that can be derived from other presently available data sets .",
    "while these data are not yet as constraining as the sneia , cmb and bao data , they potentially can reassure us ( if they provide constraints consistent with those from the better known data ) , or if the two sets of constraints are inconsistent this might lead to the discovery of hidden systematic errors or rule out the cosmological model under consideration .",
    "other data that have been used to constrain cosmological parameters include galaxy cluster gas mass fraction ( e.g. , ) , gamma - ray burst luminosity distance ( e.g. , ) , large - scale structure ( e.g. , @xcite ) , strong gravitational lensing ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and angular size ( e.g. , @xcite ) data . while the constraints from these data are less restrictive than those derived from the sneia , cmb and bao data , both types of data result in largely compatible constraints that generally support a currently accelerating cosmological expansion .",
    "this gives us confidence that the broad outlines of the `` standard '' cosmological model are now in place .",
    "measurements of the hubble parameter as a function of redshift , @xmath16 , have also been used to constrain cosmological parameters ( see @xcite for a review ) . a variant of this test uses lookback time data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "building on the work of @xcite , simon @xcite used the differential ages of 32 passively evolving galaxies to determine 9 @xmath16 measurements in the redshift range @xmath17 .",
    "cosmological constraints derived using these data are described in @xcite ; more recent references may be traced through @xcite .",

    "@xcite sample to 11 measurements of @xmath16 in the redshift range @xmath18 .",
    "these data have been used for cosmological tests by shafieloo & clarkson @xcite .",
    "it has become common to augment the s10 data with the gaztaaga ( 2009 , hereafter g09 ) @xcite estimates of @xmath16 determined from line - of - sight bao peak position observations . these data , listed in table 1 ,",
    "have also been used to constrain cosmological parameters ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein )",
    ". there are problems with a number of these analyses .",
    "some of them include both the g09 data points at @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( which we use here ) , as well as the g09 single summary data point at @xmath21 that is based on exactly the same data as the two individual points .",
    "in addition , a number of these analyses either ignore the g09 systematic errors or incorrectly account for them .",
    "we account for the g09 statistical and systematic errors by combining them in quadrature ; the g09 data points we list in table 1 are identical to those used by ma & zhang @xcite and zhang et al .",

    "in this paper we use the 13 s10 and g09 @xmath16 measurements listed in table 1 to constrain the @xmath0cdm and @xmath11cdm models and the xcdm parametrization .",
    "the resulting constraints are compatible with those derived using other techniques .",
    "we also use these @xmath16 data in combination with bao and sneia measurements to jointly constrain cosmological parameters in these models . adding the @xmath16 data tightens the constraints , somewhat significantly in some parts of parameter space for some of the models we study .",
