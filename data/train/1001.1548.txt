    "the past decade has seen much research activity devoted to extending quantum mechanics into the complex domain @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that dirac hermiticity may be generalized to include complex non - dirac - hermitian hamiltonians that are @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "( a hamiltonian is _ dirac - hermitian _ if @xmath1 , where @xmath2 represents combined complex conjugation and matrix transposition .",
    "a hamiltonian is @xmath0 symmetric if it is invariant under combined spatial reflection @xmath3 and time reversal @xmath4 . )",
    "these complex hamiltonians are physically acceptable because ( i ) their eigenvalues are all real , and ( ii ) they generate unitary time evolution @xcite .",
    "research on @xmath0 quantum mechanics has revealed interesting and surprising new phenomena , and in the past year some of these new phenomena have actually been observed in laboratory experiments @xcite .    motivated by a desire to understand @xmath0 quantum mechanics better , there has been a significant body of research on complex classical mechanics .",
    "conventional classical mechanics is the study of the real solutions to hamilton s equations of motion . in the recently established field of _",
    "complex classical mechanics _ , we expand this study to include _ all _ solutions , complex as well as real , to hamilton s equations @xcite .",
    "complex classical mechanics has proved to be useful , in part because it provides a heuristic explanation of the quantum @xmath0 phase transition between a _ broken _ @xmath0-symmetric phase ( where some of the quantum eigenvalues are real and some are complex ) and an _ unbroken _ @xmath0-symmetric phase ( where all of the quantum eigenvalues are real ) . in the broken phase of @xmath0",
    "quantum mechanics the classical trajectories are open , and in the unbroken phase the classical trajectories are closed and periodic @xcite .",
    "bohr - sommerfeld quantization clarifies the association between complex energy and open classical trajectories versus real energy and closed classical trajectories .",
    "this association , which is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , arises because the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition contains a path integral along a closed contour : @xmath5 .",
    "evidently , this quantization condition can only be applied if the classical orbits are closed .",
    "studies of complex classical trajectories have also led to studies of probability densities in the complex plane , which in turn have given rise to the formulation of a complex correspondence principle @xcite .",
    "in addition , studies of complex classical mechanics have proved to be useful in their own right and may lead to a deeper understanding of the transition from nonchaotic to chaotic behavior @xcite .",
    "one particularly interesting area of research concerns the generalization of complex classical mechanics from real to complex energy .",
    "it can be argued that because of the time - energy uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics , @xmath6 , one can not measure an energy with absolute precision unless one has an infinite amount of time in which to perform the measurement .",
    "we then suppose that this uncertainty in the value of the energy exists in classical mechanics and further assume that this uncertainty @xmath7 may be complex .",
    "the surprise is that generalizing complex classical mechanics from real to complex energy produces a theory that exhibits many of the qualitative features of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the principal effect of extending the energy from real to complex values is that particle trajectories @xmath8 , which are curves in the complex-@xmath9 plane , cease to be closed .",
    "for example , while the particle trajectories for the classical anharmonic - oscillator hamiltonian @xmath10 are all closed when the energy @xmath11 is real , the trajectories are open and spiral outward to infinity when @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "more interestingly , while the trajectories @xmath8 for a double - well anharmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath13 are closed in the complex-@xmath9 plane , they are no longer closed when @xmath11 is complex . however , the remarkable property of these trajectories is that they do not spiral outward to infinity .",
    "rather , they run back and forth endlessly from the vicinity of one well to the vicinity of the other well in a fashion that is reminiscent of quantum tunneling .",
    "to be specific , if a particle is initially in the classically allowed region on the real axis in the left well , the particle spirals outward , crosses the imaginary axis , and then spirals _ inward _ into the right well .",
    "then , the particle spirals outward again and visits the left well .",
    "thus , the two wells in the potential act like strange attractors .",
    "this oscillatory process continues forever , but the trajectory never crosses itself .",
    "this complex double - well classical system is different from the corresponding quantum - mechanical system in that a trajectory can not cross itself unless the classical trajectory is periodic , and thus a classical particle on an open trajectory can never revisit any point in the complex plane .",
    "however , many features of quantum mechanics are mirrored in the properties of this classical behavior .",
    "for example , as the imaginary part of the classical energy increases , the characteristic `` tunneling '' time ( the time required for the particle to spiral inward and outward around a pair of turning points ) decreases inversely , just as one would expect of a quantum particle . as in the case of quantum tunneling",
    ", the particle spends a long time in proximity to a given pair of turning points before crossing the imaginary axis to the other pair of turning points . on average",
    ", the classical particle spends equal amounts of time on either side of the imaginary axis .",
    "furthermore , the pattern of trajectories changes qualitatively as the real part of the energy is varied . for some regions of @xmath14",
    "the trajectories form a parity - symmetric pattern and these energy regions interlace with other regions of @xmath14 for which the trajectories form a parity - anti - symmetric pattern .",
    "having observed the tunneling - like behavior of a classical particle with complex energy in a double well , it is natural to ask what happens to a particle in a periodic potential .",
    "an electron in a crystal lattice is described by such a potential .",
    "an elementary physical system that also has a periodic potential consists of a simple pendulum in a uniform gravitational field @xcite . without loss of generality",
    "we take the pendulum bob to have mass @xmath15 , the string to have length @xmath16 , and the uniform gravitational to have field strength @xmath17 .",
    "if the gravitational potential energy of the system is zero at the height of the pivot point of the pendulum and if @xmath9 represents the angle through which the pendulum bob swings , then the hamiltonian @xmath18 for the pendulum is @xmath19 the classical equations of motion for this hamiltonian are @xmath20    the hamiltonian @xmath18 for this system is a constant of the motion , and thus the energy @xmath11 is a time - independent quantity . if we take the energy @xmath11 to be real , we find that the classical trajectories are confined to cells of horizontal width @xmath21 .",
    "this is the periodic analog of the double - well anharmonic oscillator . if the energy of the classical particle in a periodic potential is taken to be complex , the particle hops from well to well in analogy to the behavior of a quantum particle in a double well .",
    "this hopping behavior is a deterministic random walk @xcite .",
    "the most dramatic analogy between complex classical mechanics and quantum mechanics is established by showing that there exist narrow conduction bands in the periodic potential for which the complex classical particle exhibits unidirectional hopping and the quantum particle exhibits resonant tunneling .",
    "the behavior of such a classical particle is discussed in detail in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a lengthy numerical analysis was done that shows that the classical conduction bands have a narrow but finite width ( see fig .",
    "the edges of the conduction bands are sharply defined .",
    "potential . hopping behavior",
    "is indicated by a hyphen - and conduction is indicated by an x. the symbol & indicates that no tunneling takes place ; tunneling does not occur for energies whose imaginary part is close to 0 . in some regions of the energy plane very intensive numerical studies were done and the x s and - s are densely packed .",
    "this picture delineates the features of band theory : if the imaginary part of the energy is taken to be @xmath22 , then as the real part of the energy increases from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , five narrow conduction bands are encountered .",
    "these bands are located near @xmath25 .",
    "this picture is symmetric about @xmath26 and the bands get thicker as @xmath27 increases .",
    "a total of 68689 points were classified to make this plot . in most places",
    "the resolution ( distance between points ) is @xmath28 , but in several regions the distance between points is shortened to @xmath29 .",
    "note that the band edges are clearly and sharply defined . ]",
    "having studied the behavior of a particle in a trigonometric periodic potential , it is natural to generalize this analysis by considering the behavior of a particle in an elliptic potential .",
    "elliptic functions are doubly - periodic generalizations of trigonometric functions .",
    "also , they are analytic except for simple poles , and this allows us to continue analytically the classical trajectories into the complex plane .",
    "the specific hamiltonian that we have chosen to examine is the obvious generalization of the hamiltonian in ( [ e1 ] ) : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a _ cnoidal _",
    "function @xcite . when the parameter @xmath32 , the cnoidal function reduces to the singly - periodic function @xmath33 and when @xmath34 the cnoidal function becomes @xmath35 . when @xmath36 , the cnoidal function is periodic in both the real and imaginary directions and it is meromorphic .",
    "( a _ meromorphic _ function is analytic in the finite-@xmath37 plane except for well - separated pole singularities . )",
    "the real part of the cnoidal potential @xmath31 is plotted in fig .",

    "the turning points are indicated by small squares and the pole singularities of the cnoidal function are indicated by small circles . in the right pane",
    "the particle trajectory is superimposed on a three - dimensional relief plot of the real part of the cnoidal function . ]",
    "the classical particle trajectories satisfy hamilton s equations @xmath41 the trajectories for @xmath42 are elaborate in that the classical particles can move vertically as well as horizontally .",
    "figure [ f2 ] shows a typical trajectory of a particle having complex energy .",
    "the energy of the particle is @xmath40 and @xmath43 .",
    "we know from ref .",
    "@xcite that if @xmath32 , the particle will spiral outward from a pair of turning points and then hop horizontally to an adjacent site on the real-@xmath9 axis .",
    "it is remarkable that even though @xmath44 is very small , the particle moves vertically .",
    "thus , giving the parameter @xmath44 a nonzero value represents a singular perturbation of the hamiltonian in ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ f2 ] shows the real part of the cnoidal function @xmath45 plotted as a function of complex @xmath9 .",
    "the poles of the cnoidal function appear as chimneys in both the positive and the negative directions .",
    "note that the path of the particle rolls around the singularities until it is captured by a pair of turning points in another cell .",
    "the particle spirals inward around these turning points and then spirals outward again before leaving the cell and heading to another .",
    "the novelty of the cnoidal potential is that complex classical - mechanical particles may hop from cell to cell in both horizontal and vertical directions .",
    "while this motion appears to be two - dimensional , we emphasize that the hamiltonian in ( [ e3 ] ) has only one ( complex ) degree of freedom .    what happens to the trajectory of the particle in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] if we follow it for a longer period of time ?",
    "figure [ f3 ] shows the trajectory for @xmath46 .",
    "observe that the particle is temporarily captured by 16 cells in this time period .",
    "these cells are numbered in the order in which their turning points capture the particle , where by _ capture _ we mean that the particle spirals around the turning points in that cell .",
    "after the particle leaves cell 1 , it is temporarily captured by the turning points in cell 2 , which is northeast of and adjacent to cell 1 .",
    "similarly , cell 3 is northeast of and adjacent to cell 2 .",
    "however , the particle then jumps nonadjacently to cell 4 , passing briefly through cells 2 , 5 , and 1 , without being captured by the turning points in these cells .",
    "note that the particle in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] is never captured by the same pair of turning points twice .",
    "the behavior of this complex self - avoiding trajectory is typical of a particle whose energy lies in a conduction band .",
    "it is not easy to verify it , but a careful examination of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] shows that the energy @xmath47 lies in the middle of a conduction band .",

    "each cell contains one pair of turning points . )",
    "the particle spirals out of cell 1 and is captured by the turning points in cell 2 .",
    "it then escapes from these turning points and is captured by the turning points in cell 3 , and so on .",
    "note that cell 1 is adjacent to cell 2 , and that cell 2 is adjacent to cell 3 , but that cell 3 is _ not _ adjacent to cell 4 .",
    "the path shown in this figure reaches cell 16 at @xmath48 . the particle shown in this figure",
    "is never captured by the same pair of turning points twice .",
    "this is because the energy of the particle lies in a conduction band , as one can see from a careful examination of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . ]    to see how the trajectory of a particle behaves when the energy of the particle is not in a conduction band , we change the energy of the particle in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] to @xmath49 .",
    "this energy lies outside a conduction band , and consequently the particle can be recaptured by pairs of turning points . in particular",
    ", one can see in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] that as @xmath50 runs from @xmath51 to @xmath52 the particle is captured twice by the turning points in six cells .",
    "this particle appears to be executing a two - dimensional deterministic random walk .",
    "except that the energy of the particle is @xmath53 .",
    "this energy does not lie in a conduction band , and consequently the particle is captured twice by several pairs of turning points .",
    "the turning - point captures are labeled sequentially by the numbers in the circles . as an example of a double capture , when the particle is captured for the sixteenth time , it is in the same cell as it was during its fourteenth capture .",
    "note that complex trajectory never crosses itself . ]    to compare in greater detail the differences between conduction - band and nonconduction - band trajectories , we investigate two trajectories that arise from the initial point @xmath38 when @xmath54 . for the first trajectory",
    "we take the energy to be @xmath55 and for the second trajectory we take the energy to be @xmath56 .",
    "an examination of fig .  [ f1 ] shows that in the former case the energy is in a conduction band and in the latter case the energy is not . in fig .",
    "[ f5 ] we plot both trajectories for @xmath57 .",
    "the first trajectory moves off in a northwesterly direction and never returns . in the left pane of fig .",
    "[ f5 ] we show the first fourteen captures .",
    "the right pane shows the second trajectory .",
    "this trajectory begins to revisit cells starting with its seventh capture .",
    "we emphasize that the trajectory never crosses itself .",
    "( left pane ) and @xmath56 ( right pane ) in a cnoidal potential with @xmath58 .",
    "both trajectories begin at @xmath38 and run from @xmath59 until @xmath60 . in the left pane the energy is in a conduction band and the trajectory",
    "never revisits any cell , but in the right pane the energy is not in a conduction band and the trajectory is recaptured by previously visited turning points . ]",
    "there are two possible ways for a trajectory to turn around when the energy of the particle is not in a conduction band .",
    "these are shown in the middle and right panes of fig .",
    "[ f6 ] . in all three panes in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] a trajectory begins at the lower end of the figure and moves upward . in the left pane",
    "the trajectory loops around the two turning points and encounters a pole singularity , which deflects the trajectory upwards into the next cell .",
    "the next two panes show trajectories that are deflected downward by a pole singularity ; these trajectories will be recaptured by a previous pair of turning points .",
    "the trajectory in the middle pane differs from that in the right pane in that it encircles the lower turning point in an anticlockwise direction and thus it continues downward to the _ left _ of the original upward trajectory .    .",
    "all three trajectories begin at the lower end of the figure . in the left pane",
    "the trajectory loops around a pair of turning points ( small squares ) and is then deflected by a pole singularity ( small circle ) upward into the next cell .",
    "the other two panes show the different ways for the trajectory to turn back on itself . ]    to investigate what happens at the edge of a conduction band , we have done a detailed numerical study of trajectories of particles having the same imaginary energy component @xmath61 but different real energies for a given value of @xmath44 and @xmath62 .",
    "we have then determined the time required for a particle trajectory to turn around as the real part of the energy nears the edge of a conduction band .",
    "one would expect that it takes longer for the particle trajectory to turn around , as it does in the right pane of fig .",
    "[ f5 ] , when the real part of the energy approaches the band edge . measuring the precise turn - around time",
    "is difficult , and to do so we must look for turn - around behavior of a consistent type ; we have chosen to look for the behavior shown in the _ right _ pane of fig .",
    "[ f6 ] . in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] we plot the turn - around time @xmath63 as a function of the real part of the energy while holding the imaginary part of the energy constant .",
    "the band edge is located at @xmath64 .",
    "the dotted curve is a fit to the data points of the form @xmath65     for a complex trajectory near the edge of a conduction band .",
    "the complex cnoidal potential has @xmath54 and @xmath63 is plotted as a function of the real part of the energy of the particle . the imaginary part of the energy is held constant for all data points at @xmath66 .",
    "the turn - around time becomes infinite at the edge of the conduction band @xmath67 .",
    "the dotted line is the fitting curve in ( [ e5 ] ) . ]",
    "there is a deep connection between quantum mechanics and complex classical mechanics . in the complex domain",
    "the classical trajectories exhibit a remarkable behavior that is analogous to quantum tunneling and periodic potentials exhibit a surprising and intricate feature that closely resembles quantum band structure .",
    "we have seen in this paper that the classical bands , just like the quantum bands , have finite width and well - defined sharp edges .",
    "the complex trajectories of a particle in a doubly - periodic potential can exhibit a wider range of qualitative behaviors than those of a particle in a singly - periodic potential partly because there is a two - dimensional array of cells containing pairs of turning points and also because doubly - periodic potentials have singularities .",
    "we have observed the following features : ( i ) the path of a particle can go both vertically and horizontally as the particle visits the cells in the complex-@xmath9 plane ( see fig .",
    "( ii ) when a particle is captured by a pair of turning points in a cell , the number of turns in the inward and outward spirals does not change from cell to cell , and thus there is a characteristic capture - and - escape time ( see figs .",
    "[ f2][f4 ] ) .",
    "this time depends on the energy of the particle and on the value of @xmath44 .",
    "( iii ) if the energy of the particle does not lie in a conduction band , the particle can be captured by pairs of turning points multiple times ( see fig .  [ f4 ] ) .",
    "( iv ) the particle trajectory is continuous , and therefore each new cell that a particle visits is adjacent to the previous cell .",
    "however , the particle is not always captured by the turning points in an adjoining cell ; captures may occur nonlocally ( see fig .",
    "( v ) finally , when the energy of a particle lies in a conduction band , the particle is never captured twice by any pair of turning points .",
    "however , the trajectory of the particle is not necessarily unidirectional ; the particle may exhibit elaborate kinds of zigzag motions as it drifts through the lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) .",
    "a difficult and so far unanswered question is , does a complex classical particle whose energy is not in a conduction band undergo a two - dimensional random walk in a doubly - periodic potential as it visits the cells in the lattice ?",
    "the answer to this question is not obvious because the trajectory of the particle can not cross itself .",
    "however , this does not mean that the particle must hop from cell to cell in a self - avoiding manner .",
    "numerical studies suggest that it is still possible for the particle to visit cells repeatedly and in any order .",
