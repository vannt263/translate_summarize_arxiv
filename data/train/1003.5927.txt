    "in plasma physics , line - tying refers to the presence of conducting walls enclosing the magnetized plasma of interest with a non - vanishing component of the magnetic field normal to the wall .",
    "line - tying is usually employed as an idealization of the boundary condition in some astrophysical plasmas , where the plasma density varies several orders of magnitude over a short distance .",
    "for example , the magnetic field lines in the coronae of stars and accretion disks are rooted in the dense , highly conducting gas below . in the limit of infinite density contrast",
    ", the dense gas may be treated as a conducting wall at which the field lines are tied .",
    "line - tying imposes a strong constraint on the plasma motion , therefore in general is stabilizing .",
    "this is particularly true in the case of ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) . in ideal mhd ,",
    "magnetic field lines are frozen - in to the plasma flow .",
    "if the footpoints of magnetic field lines are not moving , i.e. , the wall is rigid , then the footpoint mapping following the field lines from one end to another is conserved . in resistive mhd",
    ", magnetic field lines are allowed to slip though the plasma on a resistive time scale . in this sense ,",
    "the line - tying becomes imperfect , and the stabilizing effect becomes less stringent .",
    "it has long been speculated that solar coronal loops can remain stable for longer than typical mhd instability time scale due to line - tying stabilization .",
    "@xcite    line - tying may also be used in a broader context with a flow imposed on the boundary , to model the convection on the solar surface or the rotation of accretion disks .",
    "the imposed flow shuffles the footpoints of magnetic field lines , twists up and entangles them , thereby converting the kinetic energy of the flow into the magnetic energy in the field .",
    "release of the stored magnetic energy powers some of the most splendid plasma phenomena such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) .",
    "dissipation of the magnetic energy on smaller scales is thought to be the energy source of the coronal heating . in a seminal paper ,",
    "parker argued that when the magnetic field line topology becomes complicated due to the footpoint shuffling , tangential discontinuities ( current sheets ) inevitably will form.@xcite in the presence of dissipative mechanisms such as resistivity , tangential discontinuities will be smoothed out and the magnetic energy will be turned into heat .",
    "parker coined the term `` topological dissipation '' to describe this process .",
    "following parker s original suggestion , many authors @xcite have shown by direct numerical simulation that random shuffling of the coronal magnetic field lines by photospheric motions progressively increases the current density , resulting in sporadic energy release .",
    "the key ingredient of parker s scenario of coronal heating is the ubiquitous presence of current sheets in a magnetized plasma . to illustrate his point , parker considered a uniform magnetic field @xmath0 line - tied to conducting plates at @xmath1 , which represent the photosphere .",
    "motions in the photosphere displace the field - line footpoints and entangle the field lines .",
    "suppose we freeze the footpoints and let the system relax to the minimum energy state under the condition of preserving all the ideal topological constraints .",
    "parker argues that in general the minimum energy state must contain tangential discontinuities . since its first appearance in ref .",
    "@xcite , this simple setting has become the `` standard model '' of the parker problem .",
    "the property that magnetostatic equilibria tend to form tangential discontinuities is stated as a magnetostatic theorem in parker s book.@xcite although parker gives compelling physical arguments in support of the theorem , no rigorous proof is given .",
    "parker s claim has stimulated considerable debate that continues to this day@xcite , without apparent consensus .",
    "the point of contention is whether or not a magnetic field with neither null points , nor separatrices , nor closed field lines can develop tangential discontinuities . it is well established that null points , separatrices , or closed field lines are the preferential sites for current sheet formation when a system undergoes some instabilities or is deformed via boundary conditions.@xcite in the parker problem , however , none of these structures are present .",
    "van ballegooijen was the first to question parker s claim .",
    "he demonstrated by an analytical argument that the equilibrium will always be continuous , unless the footpoint mapping is discontinuous.@xcite subsequently , several authors have found smooth equilibria using either linear theories for small footpoint displacements or lagrangian numerical relaxation schemes for nonlinear problems .",
    "@xcite however , as pointed out by ng and bhattacharjee,@xcite van ballegooijen s argument is valid only for simple current sheets ; it fails if a current sheet has multiple branches joined together ( see figure 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ng and bhattacharjee also proved a theorem which asserts that there is at most one smooth equilibrium for any given smooth footpoint mapping .",
    "it follows that if a smooth equilibrium becomes unstable , there is no other smooth equilibrium the system can relax to ; therefore the system must relax to an equilibrium with tangential discontinuities .",
    "the theorem of ng and bhattacharjee is within the framework of reduced magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) , which assumes the existence of a strong guide field.@xcite it also assumes double - periodicity in the plane perpendicular to the guide field .",
    "it is not known at the present time whether the result can be generalized to full mhd or more general boundary conditions , although aly @xcite appears to have taken an important step towards that goal .",
    "lagrangian relaxation studies indeed suggest current sheet may form under certain circumstances,@xcite although it is rather difficult to draw decisive conclusions from numerical studies due to limits of spatial resolution .",

    "[ sec : openissue ] .",
    "a line - tied screw pinch is often employed as a model of solar coronal loops . assuming that the plasma pressure is negligible , in cylindrical coordinates @xmath2",
    ", the equilibrium magnetic field is @xmath3 which satisfies the force balance equation@xmath4 in a periodic pinch of length @xmath5 , we may decompose the plasma displacement @xmath6 into fourier basis in both @xmath7 and @xmath8 directions .",
    "therefore we consider an eigenmode of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the growth rate , and both @xmath12 and @xmath13 are integers .",
    "the @xmath14 internal kink mode is unstable if the safety factor @xmath15 drops below unity within the plasma and increases with radius .",
    "unstable modes have helical symmetry , depending on @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the combination @xmath16 , and possess a so - called resonant surface @xmath17 , on which @xmath18 . due to the constraint of periodicity",
    ", the resonant surface must also be a rational surface on which magnetic field lines are closed .",
    "the driver of the instability lies within @xmath19 , and the radial component of the plasma displacement nearly vanishes outside it .",
    "it has been shown that the thin transition layer near @xmath19 predicted from linear theory corresponds to an infinite current sheet in finite amplitude theory , at least within the framework of reduced , ideal mhd.@xcite in a line - tied pinch , the boundary condition constrains the plasma displacement @xmath6 to zero at @xmath1 .",
    "therefore a fourier decomposition can no longer be done in @xmath7 , and the eigenvalue problem is inherently two - dimensional ( 2d ) . at a fundamental level , there is a deeper issue . in a line - tied screw pinch ,",
    "all magnetic field lines are topologically equal ; they all go from one end plate to another ( assuming @xmath20 everywhere )",
    ". therefore the notions of rational surfaces and resonant surfaces are no longer valid .",
    "a question is : is there still a steep gradient in the eigenmode , as in the periodic counterpart ? and if the answer is yes , where will the steep gradient be ?    in ref .",
    "@xcite a detailed study of the line - tied internal kink mode has been carried out .",
    "it was found that the fastest growing internal kink mode in a line - tied system possesses a steep internal layer .",
    "the internal layer is located at the resonant surface of the fastest growing periodic mode in an _ infinitely _ long system ( i.e. , @xmath21 is a continuum ) .",
    "however , the internal layer in a line - tied system is smoother than its periodic counterpart . only in the limit",
    "@xmath22 does the former approaches the latter .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : kink - eigen ] , which shows the radial displacement @xmath23 and parallel current @xmath24 of eigenmodes for different @xmath5 along the midplane @xmath25 , as compared to its periodic counterparts .",
    "similar results have been found in refs . @xcite for different equilibria and ref .",
    "@xcite including finite pressure effects .",
    "there is a critical length @xmath26 for the instability .",
    "when @xmath27 the internal kink is stabilized .",
    "the critical length @xmath26 is approximately given by    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath19 are the growth rate and the resonant surface of the fastest growing periodic mode , respectively , and",
    "@xmath30 is the @xmath7 component of the alfvn speed .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the heuristic stability criterion that the unstable mode is stabilized when the alfvn transit time along the loop is less than the inverse of the growth rate in a periodic system .",
    "once the critical length @xmath26 is known , the growth rate @xmath11 for a system of length @xmath5 can be determined by solving the equation @xmath31 in the limit @xmath22 , the growth rate @xmath32 .",

    "often the coronal loop length and the axial field @xmath37 are given , and the azimuthal component @xmath38 is generated by applying some footpoint twisting .",
    "then we can ask the following question : what is the critical twisting angle @xmath39 for the loop to become unstable ? from @xmath36 we have the critical tilt angle @xmath40 when @xmath5 is given .",
    "that corresponds to a critical twisting angle@xmath41 the precise value of the critical tilt angle @xmath42 depends on the profile .",
    "for the profile @xmath43 , which was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , the critical tilt angle at @xmath44 is approximately given by @xmath45 the critical tilt angle depends on the aspect ratio @xmath46 rather weakly . for a coronal loop with @xmath47 , the critical tilt angle @xmath48 , which is approximately @xmath49 . for a shorter loop with @xmath50 ,",
    "the critical tilt angle is about @xmath51 ; whereas for an extremely long loop with @xmath52 , the critical tilt angle is about @xmath53 .",
    "these numbers are in reasonable agreement with estimates obtained from balancing the poynting flux from the coronal base and the observed coronal loss rate , which give a tilt angle ranging from @xmath54 to @xmath55.@xcite      when a small but finite resistivity @xmath56 is included in the theory , line - tying becomes imperfect . in ref .",
    "@xcite , delzanno _",
    "et al_. studied the resistive effects on line - tied internal kink modes .",
    "they found that when the system length @xmath5 is greater than the ideal critical length @xmath57 , the mode growth rate is similar to the ideal one . however",
    ", resistivity can make a system with @xmath58 unstable .",
    "interestingly , the critical length of a resistive system @xmath59 is found to be independent of @xmath56 .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we studied the effects of line - tying on the resistive tearing instability in slab geometry .",
    "the equilibrium has a strong guide field @xmath37 along @xmath7 , and @xmath60 changes direction across a current layer around @xmath61 .",
    "two conducting plates at @xmath1 provide the line - tied boundary condition .",
    "this configuration is ideally stable , but can be unstable to the tearing mode when @xmath62 .",
    "the instability is studied within the framework of the rmhd equations.@xcite after proper normalization , the magnetic field and the velocity can be expressed in terms of the flux function @xmath63 and the stream function @xmath8 as @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",

    "the system is unstable to the tearing mode with a growth rate @xmath74 in the asymptotic limit @xmath75 . with line - tying",
    ", fourier decomposition along @xmath7 is not possible and a two - dimensional eigenvalue problem has to be solved . in this case , the system is unstable only when @xmath5 is greater than a critical length @xmath26 , which is found to be independent of @xmath56 .",
    "however , near marginal stability , the linear unstable mode grows slowly , and plasma inertia can be neglected everywhere . with this `` force - free '' approximation ,",
    "the growth rate @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath56 .",
    "when @xmath5 is sufficiently long , plasma inertia can no longer be neglected within the resistive layer . in this regime , the line - tied growth rate approaches the periodic one , and the @xmath74 scaling is recovered .",
    "the transition from the force - free regime to the inertia dominated regime occurs at a transition length @xmath76 which scales as @xmath77 .",
    "notice that without line - tying , the force - free approximation only applies in the outer region ; in the resistive layer , plasma inertia ( or viscosity ) has to be included , otherwise the equations become singular at the resonant surface where @xmath78 . in a line - tied system , on the other hand , it is possible that the force - free approximation is applicable over the whole domain , provided that the mode grows slowly .",
    "this is because that there is no resonant surface in a line - tied system , and the equations are not singular even without plasma inertia .",
    "the resistive layer persists even with line - tying .",
    "however , line - tying effects make the resistive layer smoother ; when the system length @xmath5 becomes longer , the resistive layer becomes steeper .",
    "this general trend , as shown in figure [ fig : resisitive - layer ] , resembles that in the internal layer of the ideal internal kink mode .",
    "similar results have been found in cylindrical geometry by delzanno _",
    "et al_. @xcite",
    "a question that remains open is the nonlinear saturation of ideal internal kink mode in a line - tied screw pinch .",
    "after the onset of the instability , if we let the magnetic field relax to a minimum energy state but preserve all the ideal topological constraints , will it develop a tangential discontinuity ?",
    "this is an excellent setting for testing parker s conjecture , as the initial condition contains neither null points nor separatrices nor closed field lines . in a periodic pinch",
    "the answer to the question is yes , as shown by rosenbluth _",
    "et al_. that a helical ribbon - like current sheet will form at the resonant surface , which is also a rational surface.@xcite in a line - tied system , the answer is not so clear .",
    "the steep gradient in the line - tied eigenfunction ( figure [ fig : kink - eigen ] ) suggests that a thin current filament will form .",
    "indeed , a helical thin current filament has been observed in several nonlinear simulations .",
    "@xcite however , whether it is a current singularity or not is very difficult to settle by a numerical calculation . we have seen that line - tying in general has the effect of smoothing out the internal layer of the linear eigenmode ; it may have a similar effect to the nonlinear saturation and turn a current singularity into a thin current layer with a finite width .",
    "if this turns out to be the case , we may expect the current layer to become thinner as the system length becomes longer , assuming that the equilibrium profile remains unchanged .",
    "the theorem of ng and bhattacharjee , as discussed in the introduction , asserts that if a smooth equilibrium becomes unstable , the system must relax to an equilibrium with tangential discontinuity . according to the theorem",
    ", it appears that the ideal internal kink mode will develop a current sheet .",
    "however , the theorem does not apply to the present case for the following reasons .",
    "first , the theorem is proved within the framework of rmhd , in which the ideal internal kink mode is marginally stable . to capture the internal kink mode one has to carry out the expansion to higher orders .",
    "this also raises the question whether the theorem can be generalized to full mhd or not , as some unstable modes are clearly missing in rmhd .",
    "second , the proof assumes double periodicity in the perpendicular plane , and a screw pinch does not belong to this category .",
    "recently , in a series of papers @xcite , low and coauthors have tried to demonstrate unambiguously the formation of current singularities using what they call `` topologically untwisted fields '' , which , in the context of force - free fields , is synonymous with potential fields .",
    "that is , they limit themselves to a special subset of force - free fields which contains no electric current . in this case",
    ", the magnetic field can be expressed as @xmath79 with some potential @xmath80 , where @xmath80 satisfies @xmath81 because @xmath82 is divergenceless . in a simply connected , compact domain ,",
    "@xmath80 is uniquely determined up to an additive constant if the normal derivative of @xmath80 is specified on the boundary .",
    "therefore , a potential field is uniquely determined by prescribing the normal component of @xmath82 ( @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the unit normal vector ) on the boundary . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors consider a potential field in a cylinder of finite length as an initial condition ; the normal component of the field is nonzero only at the top and the bottom of the cylinder .",
    "the cylinder is then compressed to a shorter length . because the whole process is governed by the ideal induction equation , the normal component of the field remains the same . by making a _",
    "key _ _ assumption _ that the field will remain potential during the process , they circumvent the complicated problem of solving for the various stages of quasi - static evolution , and simply calculate the magnetic field in the final state as the potential field which satisfies the boundary conditions .",
    "they then numerically calculate the magnetic field line mapping from one end to the other , for both the initial and the final states .",
    "they find that for a three - dimensional ( 3d ) field , the field line mapping , and hence , the topology , is changed . because an ideal evolution preserves the magnetic topology ,",
    "the authors claim that the field must evolve into a state which contains tangential discontinuities ; furthermore , singularities may form densely due to the ubiquitous change of the field line mapping .",
    "the assumption that the field will remain potential during the compression , however , is not proven in their work .",
    "the reasoning behind the assumption could be understood as follows .",
    "consider a magnetic field line ( the base field line ) and a neighboring field line which is infinitesimally separated from it . as we follow along the field lines , in general the neighboring field line winds around the base field line at a rate @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the arc length along the field line and @xmath8 is the azimuthal angle of the displacement vector between the two field lines relative to a comoving reference frame . here",
    "the comoving reference frame is specified by three mutually perpendicular vectors at each point along the field line .",
    "one of the vectors is tangent to the field line , while the other two follow parallel transport along the field line .",
    "( see appendix [ sec : comovingframe ] for the detail of how parallel transport is defined .",
    "one also should not confuse the azimuthal angle @xmath8 here with the angle of rotational transform in a toroidal device , where the base field line is a closed loop . for the rotational transform ,",
    "the well - known frenet - serret frame is a good reference frame .",
    "the frenet - serret frame does not follow parallel transport in case the base field line has a nonvanishing torsion",
    ". see appendix [ sec : comovingframe ] for further discussion . ) in general , different neighboring field lines have different winding rates .",
    "however , for a force - free field satisfying@xmath87 with @xmath88 , it can be shown that the averaged local winding rate over all neighboring field lines is related to @xmath89 as ( see appendix [ sec : comovingframe ] for a derivation ) @xmath90 this simple relation shows that parallel current is related to the winding between neighboring field lines .",
    "for a potential field , which satisfies @xmath91 everywhere , the average local winding rate @xmath92 is equal to zero .",
    "this justifies the use of the term `` untwisted fields '' for potential fields .",
    "intuitively , it would appear to require a nonzero vorticity on the boundary , which is absent in a simple expansion or compression , to twist up the field .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that a potential field will remain potential during a simple expansion or compression .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , an explicit counterexample is constructed in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) slab geometry .",
    "the counterexample demonstrates that a potential field can evolve to a smooth , non - potential field under simple expansion or compression .",
    "the construction is summarized as follows .",
    "consider a 2d configuration in cartesian geometry , with @xmath93 the direction of symmetry .",
    "a general magnetic field may be expressed as @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 . for a force - free field",
    ", @xmath97 and @xmath63 must satisfy the grad - shafranov equation@xmath98 where @xmath89 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ffa ] ) is equal to @xmath99 in this representation . if the field is potential , then @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "let us consider a force - free field bounded by two conducting surfaces at @xmath25 and @xmath102 , with all field lines connecting one end plate to the other .",
    "the footpoint mapping from one end to the other is characterized by @xmath63 on the boundaries , as well as the axial displacement along @xmath93 when following a field line from the bottom to the top : @xmath103 here @xmath104 is the line element on the @xmath105 plane , and the subscript @xmath63 indicates that the integration is done along a constant @xmath63 contour .",
    "let the initial condition be @xmath106 with a system length @xmath107 .",
    "suppose the system has undergone a simple expansion or compression such that the system length changes to some @xmath108 .",
    "since ideal evolution preserves the footpoint mapping , the flux function @xmath63 on the boundaries and the axial displacement @xmath109 must remain unchanged . to determine the final force - free equilibrium",
    ", we must solve the two coupled equations @xmath110 and    @xmath111    subject to the conditions @xmath112 , @xmath113 , where the axial displacement @xmath109 is determined from the initial condition .",

    "topologically , the geometry is equivalent to the space between two concentric , infinitely long cylinders , therefore not simply connected.@xcite consequently , specifying the normal component of the magnetic field on the boundary does not uniquely determine the potential field .",

    "this is the topic of the next section .",
    "the governing equation for quasi - static evolution driven by boundary motions was derived by van ballegooijen ( vb ) @xcite within the framework of rmhd .",
    "this is under the assumption that the characteristic time scales of the boundary motions are much longer compared to the alfvn transit times , therefore the system remains force - free for all time to a good approximation . here",
    "we generalize the vb equation to full mhd without assuming any asymptotic ordering .",
    "we assume that the system satisfies the force - free condition ( [ eq : ffa ] ) for all time .",
