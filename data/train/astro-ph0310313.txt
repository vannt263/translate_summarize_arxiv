    "the _ rntgen x - ray satellite ( rosat ) _ observations of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) have revealed a wealth of diffuse and compact x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "many large diffuse x - ray sources have sizes greater than 100 pc .",
    "some of these diffuse sources are associated with superbubbles and supergiant shells , and others seem to originate from fields unbounded by interstellar structures identifiable at optical or radio wavelengths @xcite .    among the large diffuse x - ray sources , we have identified two objects whose diffuse x - ray emissions have ring morphologies and",
    "are centered on point sources .",
    "these two objects are intriguing because they are not bounded by superbubbles and the relative locations of the point source and the diffuse x - ray emission appear to suggest a physical association .",
    "the first object , at 5@xmath107@xmath236@xmath3 , @xmath068@xmath447@xmath552@xmath6 ( j2000 ) , is projected in the vicinity of the superbubble n103 surrounding the star cluster ngc1850 .",
    "a detailed analysis of this object shows that the large x - ray ring , 150 pc in diameter , is most likely a supernova remnant ( snr ) formed in the low - density halo of the lmc and the central point source might be an x - ray binary in the cluster hs122 , but the relationship between the snr and the x - ray binary is uncertain @xcite .",
    "the second object , shown in figure 1 , is projected on the eastern rim of the supergiant shell lmc-3 @xcite .",
    "its @xmath795 angular diameter corresponds to @xmath7140 pc , if it is in the lmc at a distance of 50 kpc @xcite .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) mosaic @xcite in figure 1b shows semi - circular diffuse x - ray emission centered on the point source rxj053335@xmath06854.9 at 5@xmath133@xmath236@xmath3 , @xmath068@xmath454@xmath555@xmath6 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the _ rosat _ high resolution imager ( hri ) mosaic @xcite in figure 1c , having a much higher angular resolution , shows diffuse x - ray emission in an east - north - west arc centered on the point source .",
    "rxj053335@xmath06854.9 is coincident with a 14th mag stellar object in the digitized sky survey ( dss ) . to determine the origin of the diffuse x - ray emission",
    ", we have analyzed the _",
    "rosat _ observations in conjunction with optical images and high - dispersion , long - slit spectra of the underlying 10@xmath8 k ionized interstellar gas . to determine the nature of the point source ,",
    "we have examined both the photometric and spectral properties of its optical counterpart , and compared them with the spectral properties of the x - ray source .",
    "the results of our analysis are reported in this paper .",
    "_ rosat _ observations of rxj053335@xmath06854.9  and its surrounding diffuse x - ray emission have been made with both the pspc and the hri detectors .",
    "the pspc is sensitive in the energy range 0.12.4 kev and has a 45% spectral resolution with on - axis angular resolution of @xmath725@xmath6 at 1 kev .",
    "the hri is sensitive at 0.12.0 kev ; it has a negligible spectral resolution , but a high on - axis angular resolution of 5@xmath6 .",
    "we have retrieved all _ rosat _ observations where rxj053335@xmath06854.9  falls within 45@xmath5 and 20@xmath5 from the field center for the pspc and hri , respectively .",
    "these observations are listed with their exposure times , locations , original targets of the observations , and the offset of rxj053335@xmath06854.9   from the field center in table 1 .",
    "note that for all pspc observations , rxj053335@xmath06854.9  lies either close to or outside the circular window support structure of 40@xmath5 diameter .",
    "for the former , the wobbling of the telescope moves the source in and out of the shadow of the window support ring and decreases the number of counts , while for the latter the detector sensitivity is reduced and the point spread function is degraded at large off - axis angles .",
    "therefore , we used the pspc observations to carry out only the spectral analysis and used the higher resolution hri observations for morphological analysis and comparisons with optical images .",
    "we have used the pros software package within iraf for spatial and spectral analyses of these observations . to improve the s / n , we merged the pspc observations centered on sn1987a with exposure times @xmath99 ks ( see table  1 ) to produce a 90 ks equivalent exposure , and extracted spectra from the combined data for further analysis .",
    "the other pspc data were deemed to be less useful and were not used .",
    "optical images were taken at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) with a ccd camera on the curtis schmidt telescope .",
    "the observations were part of the magellanic cloud emission - line survey ( mcels ) by @xcite .",
    "the detector was the site2048 # 5 ccd .",
    "its 24 @xmath10 m pixel size corresponds to 23 .",
    "images were obtained with the following filters and exposure times : h@xmath11  ( @xmath12 = 6568  , fwhm = 28  ) , 150 s ; [ ]  ( @xmath12 = 5023  , fwhm = 40  ) , 600 s ; [ ]  ( @xmath12 = 6738  , fwhm = 50  ) , 600 s ; green continuum ( @xmath12 = 5130  , fwhm = 155  ) , 300 s ; red continuum ( @xmath12 = 6852  , fwhm = 95  ) , 300 s. the h@xmath11 , [ ] , and red continuum images were obtained on 1998 november 27 , and the [ ]  and green continuum images were obtained on 2000 december 30 .",
    "the emission - line images of rxj053335@xmath06854.9  and its vicinity are presented in figure 2 .      to determine the radial velocity of the optical counterpart of rxj053335@xmath06854.9  and to examine the kinematics of the 10@xmath8 k ionized gas underlying the diffuse x - ray emission , we obtained high - dispersion spectroscopic observations using the echelle spectrograph on the blanco 4  m telescope at ctio on 2002 june 24 .",
    "the spectrograph was used with the 79 line  mm@xmath13 echelle grating and the long - focus red camera in the single - order , long - slit mode . this observing configuration",
    "provided a reciprocal dispersion of 3.4   mm@xmath13 and covered the h@xmath11 and [ n  ii ] @xmath146548,6584 lines over a slit length of @xmath73@xmath5 .",
    "the site2048 @xmath15 ccd used has a pixel size of 24 @xmath10 m , which corresponds to @xmath73.7 km  s@xmath13  pixel@xmath13 along the dispersion direction and @xmath16 pixel@xmath13 along the slit .",
    "the slit width was @xmath17 and the resultant instrumental fwhm was 15 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "the angular resolution , determined by the seeing , was 2@xmath18 .",
    "the slit was oriented at pa = @xmath19 and the total integration time was 900 s.",
    "the x - ray point source rxj053335@xmath06854.9  is projected within the lmc and apparently surrounded by the diffuse x - ray arc . below we discuss the nature of the diffuse emission and the point source individually .",
    "the circular boundary of the diffuse x - ray emission surrounding rxj053335@xmath06854.9  suggests that the hot gas may have been energized by a supernova explosion at its geometric center .",
    "the angular radius varies from 4@xmath5 on the east side to 55 on the west side .",
    "this diffuse x - ray emission region does not show morphological correspondence with optical emission . as shown in figure 2 , long",
    "( @xmath20 20@xmath5 ) optical filaments exist but are associated with the supergiant shell lmc-3 and do not delineate the x - ray emission region . from the morphology alone ,",
    "the hot gas responsible for the diffuse x - ray emission does not appear to be associated with the cooler gas responsible for the optical emission .",
    "it is unlikely that this diffuse x - ray source is associated with a snr in the galactic plane ( within 500 pc ) , because its linear size ( @xmath212 pc ) implies a very young age and it would have been much brighter .",
    "the probability is also small for this source to originate from a snr in the galactic halo , because massive stars do not reside in the halo and the low stellar density in the halo implies a very low type ia supernova rate . on the other hand ,",
    "its projected location in the lmc is within a large - scale star - forming region where the supernova rate is expected to be high ; therefore , it is most likely that a snr in the lmc is responsible for this diffuse x - ray emission . the linear radius of the x - ray emission region , 6082 pc , is larger than those of most snrs , a few tens of pc in diameter , but is reasonable for snrs formed in a low - density medium .",
    "the physical conditions of the x - ray - emitting gas can be derived from the observed x - ray spectra , which are a convolution of the intrinsic spectra , the intervening interstellar absorption , and the pspc response function .",
    "the contribution of the absorption and response function to the spectra is energy - dependent , therefore it is necessary to model the spectra in order to determine the temperature and emission measure of the x - ray sources .",
    "the diffuse emission appears to originate from hot ionized gas therefore we used the @xcite models of thin plasma emission and the @xcite models of absorption to simulate the observed spectra , and determined the best fit by @xmath22 minimization .    the best - fit model for the background - subtracted pspc spectrum ( see figure 3a ) gives a plasma temperature of @xmath23 0.3 kev , an absorption column density of @xmath24 @xmath25 , and a normalization factor @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "this plasma temperature is within the range commonly seen in snrs .",
    "the rms electron density can be determined from the normalization factor @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the electron density of the plasma , @xmath30 is the volume of the x - ray - emitting plasma , and @xmath31 is the distance to the x - ray source . assuming a filled hemispherical emitting volume with a 70 pc radius , the rms @xmath29 is @xmath70.03 @xmath32 , which is lower by at least an order of magnitude than most snrs in the lmc .",
    "if the volume filling factor @xmath33 of the x - ray - emitting plasma is less than 1 , the density would be @xmath34 times higher , but still lower than those of most snrs .",
    "the total thermal energy of the hot gas is @xmath35  ergs .",
    "the unabsorbed x - ray flux for the diffuse emission is @xmath36 ergs @xmath25 s@xmath13 , and the x - ray luminosity is @xmath37 ergs s@xmath13 in the 0.52.0 kev band .",
    "both the thermal energy and x - ray luminosity are similar to those observed in mature magellanic cloud snrs @xmath38 yr of age @xcite .",
    "the physical properties of the diffuse x - ray emission around rxj053335@xmath06854.9  are fully consistent with those of a mature snr in a low - density medium , much like the large x - ray ring around rxj050736@xmath06847.8 @xcite .",
    "the low density of the ambient interstellar medium explains the large size and the absence of a detectable optical shell .",
    "the association of the diffuse x - ray arc with a snr is further supported by the high - velocity ionized gas detected in our echelle observation .",
    "the echellogram in figure 4 shows two nebular components .",
    "the first component has a fairly uniform surface brightness and a nearly constant velocity , at @xmath39 = 279@xmath404 km  s@xmath13 , along the entire slit length .",
    "this component originates from a large - scale diffuse ionized medium in the lmc .",
    "the second component is blue - shifted from the stationary component , and the velocity offset varies from @xmath2150 km  s@xmath13 at 05 south of rxj053335@xmath06854.9  to @xmath7100 km  s@xmath13 at 18 north of rxj053335@xmath06854.9 .",
    "the high - velocity features are fainter than the large - scale diffuse component so that only the brightest feature , @xmath41 south of the star , can be identified with a filament in the emission - line images ( compare figures 2 and 4 ) .",
    "the spatial scale and magnitude of velocity offset of this nebular component are similar to those seen in snrs in the lmc @xcite .",
    "it is possible that this high - velocity nebular component is associated with the snr responsible for the diffuse x - ray arc .",
    "while the snr is in a low - density medium in general , there may exist small dense clouds which are shocked and give rise to the high - velocity nebular emission .",
    "the scarcity of the dense clouds in a low - density medium prevents the formation of a dense snr shell structure .",
    "the x - ray point source rxj053335@xmath06854.9  appears to be coincident with a 14th mag star shown in the dss .",
    "the position of rxj053335@xmath06854.9  measured from the hri image ( rh600640n00 ) is 5@xmath133@xmath2360 , @xmath068@xmath454@xmath555@xmath6 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the star has been cataloged in the guide star catalog 2.2 as gsc2.2 s013200256362 at 5@xmath133@xmath2352 , @xmath068@xmath454@xmath554@xmath6 ( j2000 ) , in the 2 micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) as psc 05333511@xmath06854544 at an almost identical position , and in the us naval observatory - a2.0 catalog as usno - a2.0 0150 - 03257930 at 5@xmath133@xmath2353 , @xmath068@xmath454@xmath554@xmath6 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the apparent offset between the x - ray source and the optical star , 45 , can be accounted for by the uncertainty in the aspect solution of the _ rosat _ pointing .",
    "therefore , we consider the x - ray and optical sources coincident .",
    "the photometric measurements of the star given by the catalogs are : @xmath42 and @xmath43 in usno - a2.0 ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 in gsc 2.2 ; and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 in 2mass .",
    "the colors of this star , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , are consistent with a red star with a spectral type of m2m3 @xcite .",
    "as the distance to this star is unknown , it can be a supergiant in the lmc , a giant in the galactic halo , or a dwarf in the solar neighborhood .",
    "these three possibilities can be distinguished by the radial velocity ( @xmath39 ) of the star : @xmath7300 km  s@xmath13 in the lmc , moderate to high velocities in the galactic halo , and low velocities in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we have extracted a sky - subtracted spectrum of this star from our echelle observation and plotted it in figure 4c .",
    "the most prominent spectral feature of the star in this wavelength range is the h@xmath11  emission line at @xmath52 km  s@xmath13 , or @xmath53 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "this small radial velocity strongly argues for this star to be located in the solar neighborhood .",
    "thus we further conclude that the star is a dwarf m2m3 star with h@xmath11  emission , one of those commonly called dme stars . adopting a dwarf luminosity class , the distance to the star",
    "is found to be 6080 pc .    to determine whether rxj053335@xmath06854.9  and the star are physically associated , we examine the x - ray spectral properties .",
    "the background - subtracted pspc spectrum of rxj053335@xmath06854.9  in figure 3b displays a spectral shape typical for stellar coronal emission . as dme stars",
    "are known to exhibit coronal activity , it is likely that rxj053335@xmath06854.9  and this dme star are physically associated .",
    "we have used the thin plasma emission model of @xcite to fit the pspc spectrum .",
    "the best - fit model gives a plasma temperature of @xmath54 kev and an absorption column density of @xmath55 @xmath25 .",
    "the small absorption column density indicates a small distance . adopting the distance of the dme star , 6080 pc ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity of rxj053335@xmath06854.9  is ( 23)@xmath56 ergs  s@xmath13 in the 0.52.0 kev range .",
    "this x - ray luminosity is completely consistent with those expected from dme stars @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the x - ray point source rxj053335@xmath06854.9is physically associated with the dme star .",
    "_ rosat _ observations of the lmc have revealed a large diffuse x - ray arc in projection around the point source rxj053335@xmath06854.9 .",
    "the relative locations of the diffuse and point sources suggest that they might originate from a common supernova explosion .",
    "we have analyzed the physical properties of the diffuse x - ray emission and determined that it is most likely a snr in a predominantly low - density medium .",
    "we have also analyzed the x - ray and optical observations of rxj053335@xmath06854.9  and concluded that it is a dme star in the solar neighborhood .",
    "therefore , these two x - ray sources are physically unrelated . as dme stars are the most prevalent stellar x - ray sources in the solar neighborhood @xcite , and as the cooling time for a snr in a low - density medium",
    "is long , the probability for the superposition of a nearby dme star with a large snr in the lmc is not negligible .",
    "the project was partially supported by the nasa grant nag 5 - 8104 .",
    "the optical images from the magellanic cloud emission - line surveys were obtained with support from the dean b. mclaughlin fund at the university of michigan and nsf grant ast-9540747 .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and the digital sky survey produced at the space telescope science institute under u.s .",
    "government grant nag w-2166 .",
