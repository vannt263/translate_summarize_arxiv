    "provided low - energy supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite is realized in nature , the next generation of colliders , the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite and the international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite are likely to copiously produce susy particles and will allow for precise measurements of their properties . once susy is established experimentally , it is the main task to explore the unknown mechanism of susy breaking ( ssb ) . while specific models of susy breaking , like e.  g.  minimal supergravity ( msugra )  @xcite can be tested against the data in a relative straight - forward manner ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) , an exploration of the parameters of the general minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite parameter space is significantly more ambitious . a first step in this direction has been done in @xcite where a fit of the real and flavour - diagonal mssm parameters has been performed using minuit @xcite .",
    "the use of minuit implied some restrictions , e.  g.  the starting point for the fit has to be close to the real values and also the correlation matrix depends significantly on the starting point due to the large number of parameters .",
    "these limitations can be overcome by the methods presented in @xcite and it is among the aims of this paper to demonstrate this in detail .    the general mssm lagrangian contains more than 100 new parameters which are only related to each other through the unknown ssb mechanism . many of these new parameters are cp - violating complex phases which are to some extent limited by the absence of neutron and electron electric dipole moments  @xcite and flavour - nondiagonal couplings which are bounded by the absence of flavour - changing neutral currents both in the quark and lepton sector  @xcite .",
    "it seems therefore justified to initially consider a somewhat constrained mssm with real parameters and flavour - diagonal couplings .",
    "furthermore universality of the first and second generation parameters appears to be a reasonable approximation while large yukawa couplings lead to significant differences for the third generation . applying these constraints ,",
    "the number of free parameters is reduced to 19 , including the top quark mass as a parameter to account for parametric uncertainties . while still many , these parameters may be confronted with an even larger number of independent observables at the lhc and ilc .",
    "thus it is of high interest how well this 19-dimensional parameter space can be restricted with future measurements .",
    "the experimental collabarations atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite at the lhc have performed detailed simulations of the possibilities to extract mass information from their future data , predominantly from the reconstruction of kinematic end - points of involving leptons and jets in cascade decays of gluinos and squarks  @xcite produced in proton proton collisions at 14  tev centre - of - mass energy .    at a future electron positron collider for collision energies up to 1  tev , the international linear collider ( ilc ) ,",
    "the kinematically accessible part of the superpartner spectrum can be studied in great detail due to favourable background conditions and the well - known initial state  @xcite .",
    "the attempt of an evaluation of the mssm lagrangian parameters and their associated errors is only useful if the experimental errors of the future measurements are known and under control .",
    "the by far best - studied susy scenario to serve as a basis for such an evaluation is an msugra - inspired benchmark scenario , the sps1a scenario . for this scenario with a relatively light superpartner spectrum , a wealth of experimental simulations exists and",
    "has recently been compiled in the framework of the international lhc / ilc study group  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we take a point close in parameter space which is consistent with low energy data and respects the dark matter constraints .",
    "we perform a global fit of the 19 parameters to those expected measurements augmented by possible measurements of topological cross - sections ( i.  e.  cross sections times branching fractions ) that will be possible at the ilc with polarised beams . since a detailed experimental simulation for some measurements is lacking , we estimate their uncertainties conservatively from the predicted cross - sections and transferring experimental efficiency from well - studied cases .    while at leading order , certain subsets of the parameters of the lagrangian only influence certain subsets of observables ( e.  g.  only three parameters determine the masses of the charginos ) this block - wise diagonal mapping of parameters to observables no longer holds at loop - level . at loop - level , in principle each observable depends on each lagrangian parameter , thus making the extraction of the parameters much more involved .",
    "this is particularly striking in the supersymmetric higgs sector where due to the large third generation yukawa couplings , radiative corrections to the mass of the lightest higgs boson are in general of the order of 30  % to 50  % .",
    "however , also for the superpartner properties radiative corrections become important as soon as experimental precision enters the percent level which is clearly the case for many of the measurements possible at the lhc and in particular at the ilc .",
    "the calculation of higher - order corrections to susy observables has started in many sectors , see e.  g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for an overview .",
    "however , a coherent framework for these corrections and a study of the transformation of the parameters defined in different renormalisation schemes has only started recently in the framework of the supersymmetry parameter analysis ( spa ) project @xcite .",
    "as theoretical basis for the global fit presented in this paper we use the calculations as implemented into the program spheno  @xcite . in spheno ,",
    "the masses and decay branching fractions of the superpartners are calculated as well as production cross sections in @xmath9 collisions .",
    "the calculation of the masses is carried out in the @xmath10 scheme and the formulae for the 1-loop masses are used as given in ref .  @xcite . in the case of the higgs boson masses , the 2-loop corrections as given in ref .",
    "@xcite are added .",
    "the calculation of the branching ratios is performed at tree - level using however running couplings evolved at the scale corresponding to the mass of the decaying particle . in case of the cross sections tree - level formulae",
    "are used except for the production of squarks in @xmath11 annihilation where the formulae of ref .",
    "@xcite are used .",
    "in addition we have added isr corrections as given in @xcite . for the evolution of parameters between various energy scales",
    "the 2-loop rges as given in @xcite are used .    in this paper",
    "we present the result of a global fit of the mssm lagrangian parameters at the electro - weak scale for a slightly modified sps1a benchmark scenario using the program fittino  @xcite . for a similar program see @xcite .",
    "previous evaluations of the errors of those parameters  @xcite did not attempt to develop a strategy to extract those parameters from data without _ a priori _ knowledge .",
    "within fittino , special attention is given precisely to this task , i.  e.  to find the parameter set which is most consistent with the data before a careful evaluation of errors and correlations is performed .",
    "the obtained parameters are then evolved to high energy scales , e.  g.  a gut scale , taking into account all correlations between the errors .",
    "this is done within the bottom - up approach , e.  g.  no assumptions regarding the underlying high energy model are used . for further details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : fitprocedure ]",
    "we shortly describe the approach used in fittino . in section",
    "[ sec : sps1aprimefit ] , the modified sps1a benchmark scenario ( sps1a ) and assumptions for the input observables are explained .",
    "the results of the fit and the error evaluation method are summarized in section  [ sec : unsmearedfitresultssps1aprime ] .",
    "the extrapolation of the obtained fit parameters and their errors to high energy scales is carried out in section  [ sec : extrapolation ] . a fit within the msugra framework",
    "is perfromed in section  [ sec : msugrafit ] and conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "from the numerous fitting options provided by fittino we have chosen the following fit procedure to extract the low - energy lagrangian parameters .",
    "first start values for the parameters are calculated using tree - level relations between parameters and a few observables  @xcite . for fits with many parameters",
    "these values are not good enough to allow a fitting tool like minuit  @xcite to find the global minimum due to the amount of loop - level induced cross - dependencies between the individual sectors of the mssm .",
    "therefore , in a second step , the parameters are refined , using a simulated annealing approach  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the parameter values are close to the global minimum so that a global fit using minuit can find the exact minimum in a third step . to determine the parameter uncertainties and correlations many individual fits with input values randomly smeared around their true values within their uncertainty range",
    "are carried out .",
    "the parameter uncertainties and the correlation matrix are derived from the spread of the fitted parameter values .",
    "the advantages of this approach are :    * all available measurements can be used at once to extract the maximal possible information from the data .",
    "* no _ a priori _ knowledge is required for the fit .",
    "the calculation of tree - level start values is a time - saving way to obtain reasonable start values for the fit .",
    "a brute force scan of the parameter space would not be feasible for a large set of parameters .",
    "* correlations between input observables can easily be taken into account .",
    "the results presented in this article were obtained with fittino version 1.1.1 .",
    "more detailed information on the algorithms used by fittino can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the sps1a inspired scenario studied in this article is defined by the following high - scale parameters @xcite : @xmath12 as opposed to sps1a @xcite , sps1a has the advantage that it is fully consistent with all available measurements including cosmological data @xcite .",
    "although in the definition of this scenario , gravity mediated susy breaking ( msugra ) is assumed , no assumption on the susy breaking mechanism is made in the reconstruction of the lagrangian parameters .",
    "this generality entails the introduction of many soft susy breaking parameters .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the parameters are reconstructed at the low - energy scale without unnecessary assumptions and can subsequently be extrapolated to the high - scale to learn about the susy breaking mechanism ( `` bottom - up '' approach ) @xcite .",
    "the current version of fittino ( version 1.1.1 ) is able to fit all low - energy susy parameters of theories fulfilling the following properties :    * there is no cp violation in the susy sector of the theory , i.  e.  all phases vanish . *",
    "no inter - generation mixing is present . *",
    "mixing within the first and second generation is zero .    with these assumptions ,",
    "24 susy parameters remain from the initial 105 parameters in the general case .    for the fit presented here ,",
    "the 24 mssm parameters available in fittino have been further reduced .",
    "we assume that the first and second generation sparticle masses are almost degenerate which is motivated by the fact that no deviation from sm predictions have been found up to now in low energy data , e.  g.  in kaon physics @xcite . in the squark sector ,",
    "one unified squark mass parameter @xmath13 is assumed for the superpartners of the left - handed u , d , s and c quarks and one mass parameter @xmath14 is used for the superpartners of the right - handed light quarks . using all assumtions , 18 free mssm parameters are left . for the fit , the low - energy parameters calculated from equations  [ eq : sps1aprimestart ] to [ eq : sps1aprimeend ]",
    "are slightly modified so that this unification is exact .",
    "additionally , the top quark mass @xmath15 is fitted to account for parametric uncertainties .    instead of the trilinear couplings @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ,",
    "the parameters @xmath19 are fitted in order to reduce correlations with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "a number of anticipated lhc and ilc measurements serve as input observables to the fit . for the ilc , running at centre - of - mass energies of 400 gev , 500 gev and 1 tev is considered with 80  % electron and 60  % positron polarization .",
    "the predicted values of the observables are calculated using the following prescriptions :    * * masses : * the experimental uncertainties of the mass measurements are taken from @xcite . for the lhc",
    ", the mass information is extracted from measurements of edge positions in mass spectra . in the gaugino and higgs sector",
    "the precision is driven by the ilc , for strongly interacting susy particles by the lhc .",
    "the benefit of combined analyses at lhc and ilc is taken into account . * * cross - sections : * only @xmath11 cross - sections are included in the fit . however , the measurement of absolute cross - sections is impossible for many channels , in which only a fraction of the final states can be reconstructed .",
    "therefore , absolute cross - section measurements are only used for the higgs - strahlung production of the light higgs boson , which is studied in detail in  @xcite . * * cross - sections times branching fractions : * since no comprehensive study of the precision of cross - section times branching fraction measurements is available , the uncertainty is assumed to be the error of a counting experiment with the following assumptions : * * the selection efficiency amounts to 50  % . * * 80  % polarization of the electron beam and 60  % polarization of the positron can be achieved . * * 500  fb@xmath22 per centre - of - mass energy and polarization is collected . *",
    "* the relative precision is not allowed to be better than 1  % and the absolute accuracy is at most 0.1  fb to account for systematic uncertainties .",
    "+ all production processes and decays of susy particles and higgs bosons are used which have a cross - section times branching ratio value of more than 1  fb in one of the @xmath11 polarization states ll , rr , lr , rl at @xmath23  gev and lr or rl at @xmath24  gev and @xmath25  gev . * * branching fractions : * the four largest branching fractions of the lightest higgs boson are included .",
    "the uncertainties on the higgs branching fractions are taken from  @xcite . * * standard model parameters : * the present uncertainties for @xmath26 and @xmath27 are used as conservative estimates .",
    "the uncertainty for the top mass @xmath28 is assumed to be 50  mev  ( experimental )  @xcite and 100  mev  ( theoretical )  @xcite . * * mixing angles : * for tree - level estimates of @xmath29 , @xmath21 and the parameters of the gaugino sector the chargino mixing angles @xmath30 and @xmath31 are used .",
    "their values are reconstructed using tree - level relations from chargino production cross - sections at different beam polarizations @xcite .",
    "no use is made of those observables in the fit .",
    "the fit result is independent of their assumed uncertainties .    in order to check the influence of theoretical uncertainties on the fit results ,",
    "the fit has been performed twice , once with experimental uncertainties only and a second time with experimental and estimated theoretical uncertainties . to be conservative",
    "we take present theoretical uncertainties . as an estimate ,",
    "the scale uncertainties as given in  @xcite are used for the mass predictions which also induce a shift in the edge observables .",
    "they are obtained by varying the scale , where the parameters are decoupled from the rge running and the shifts to the pole masses are calculated , from @xmath27 to 1  tev . in this way one gets an estimate of the missing higher order corrections for the shift from the running mass to the pole mass .",
    "here we use the complete 1-loop formulae given in @xcite for the susy masses and in addition the 2-loop corrections for the higgs sector as given in @xcite .",
    "the experimental and theoretical contributions are added in quadrature .",
    "the assumed experimental and theoretical uncertainties for the masses are listed in tables  [ tab : inputssps1aprime ] and [ tab : theoinputssps1aprime ] . for the cross - section and cross - section times branching fraction measurements ,",
    "the smallest allowed relative precision is raised to 2 % for the fit including theoretical uncertainties ( as opposed to 1 % for the fit without theoretical uncertainties ) .",
    "the full list of observables used in the fit and their uncertainties can be obtained from  @xcite .",
    "the input observables described in section  [ sec : inputs ] are used to determine the susy lagrangian parameters in a global fit under the assumptions mentioned in section  [ sec : assumptions ] . in total 18 susy parameters",
    "remain to be fitted .",
    "in addition to those , the top mass @xmath28 is fitted , since it has a relatively large uncertainty and strongly influences parts of the mssm observables .",

    "the errors obtained from subsector fits do not express a probability to find the true parameter values within the uncertainty range .",
    "uncovering these shifts by looking at the @xmath1 of the fit is unlikely in reality since a degradation of @xmath60 , which is the largest @xmath1 enhancement observed in above fits , might still yield a reasonable @xmath1 value for the fit with its 85 degrees of freedom . in any case , as this example shows , a precision determination of the susy lagrangian parameters requires a comprehensive global fit using inputs from all sectors of the theory and fitting parameters from all sectors of the theory .",

    "here we use two - loop rges for the evolution @xcite . the evolution of the parameters from the electroweak scale to the gut scale",

    "[ fig : running ] where the gut scale is defined as the scale where the @xmath61 gauge coupling @xmath62 coincides with @xmath63 gauge coupling @xmath64 ( using the proper normalisation @xmath65 ) and the value for the electroweak scale is given by @xmath66 .",
    "the latter value is motivated by the expectation that at this scale the effect of missing higher order corrections in the calculation of @xmath67 , which is most probably the most precisely measured mass , is minimized .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : running ] a the evolution for the gaugino parameters @xmath68 is presented .",
    "they are clearly under excellent control allowing for precise tests concerning their unification at @xmath69 .",

    "[ fig : running ] b and c the running of the scalar mass parameters are shown .",
    "the slepton mass parameters are under excellent control whereas the squark and the higgs mass parameters are signifcantly worse .",
    "part of this difference can be traced back to the structure of the rges as explained in detail in the second paper of @xcite .",
    "in addition the analysis used here does not coincide with ones presented in @xcite and @xcite : in @xcite and @xcite it has been assumed that all @xmath70 parameters meet within 1-sigma as up to now no good proposal exists for a precise measurement of @xmath71 .",
    "as we did not use this assumption in this study we find significantly larger errors for the third generation squark mass parameters and the higgs parameters .",
    "using this assumption or , equivalently , having tools at hand which allow for a better determination of @xmath17 , the error bands get significantly reduced as can be seen in fig .",

    "[ fig : running ] we also show the case that today s theoretical uncertainties are taken into account ( dashed lines ) . in case of the gaugino mass parameters the effect is so small that it can not be seen in the plot ( see also tab .",
    "[ tab : unsmearedfitresultsps1aprime ] ) .",
    "note that the smallness of the theoretical uncertainty on the gluino mass is due to the fact that the squarks have a similar mass .",
    "it gets larger if there is a significant hierarchy between these particles , e.  g.  in focus point scenarios .",
    "one sees that the main effect is on the parameters of the third generation sfermions and the higgs mass parameters .",
    "the main reason for this is that the error on @xmath39 and @xmath72 get considerably larger once the theoretical uncertainties are taken into account .",
    "this figure clearly shows that there is a strong need to further increase accuracies of the theoretical predictions .",
    "instead of determining the full spectrum of the general low - energy lagrangian parameters and inferring the high - scale mechanisms from them , the parameters of a more restrictive high - scale scenario can be fitted directly to the observables .",
    "this section presents an example for the msugra scenario sps1a , using the same set of observables as described in section  [ sec : inputs ] .",
    "the parameters of the scenario are @xmath20 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the latter has been fixed to 1 for this exercise .",
    "since there are only four continuous parameters , the fit converges without complex fitting techniques and the uncertainty determination is stable .",
    "the fit results for the simulated lhc+ilc measurements from section  [ sec : unsmearedfitresultssps1aprime ] and observables set to the exact prediction of the msugra model are given in table  [ tab : msugrafitresults ] , along with results for a fit just using the lhc observables in the fit . as an additional lhc measurement , the ratio of higgs couplings as simulated in @xcite has been used . for the lhc@xmath0ilc measurements , due to the much more constrained theoretical parameter space",
    ", the precision on the parameters is much better than for the general low - energy model ( see table  [ tab : unsmearedfitresultsps1aprime ] ) .",

    "+    an important test is , however , to determine how well the experimental results can be used to determine deviations from a specific high - scale model such as msugra .",
    "therefore the msugra high - energy parameters have been fitted to the observables from the sps1a inspired scenario used in section  [ sec : sps1aprimefit ] , which is only slightly modified to obtain exact unification in the first two generations of squarks and sleptions . for this case , the total @xmath1s from the two fits indicate that the lhc@xmath0ilc measurements are precise enough to discriminate the modified scenario from exact msugra ( @xmath77 , 144 n.d.f . ) , while the lhc measurements alone do not allow this insight ( @xmath78 , 25 n.d.f . ) .",
    "the lagrangian parameters of the mssm assuming universality for the first and second generation and real parameters but without assumptions on the susy breaking mechanism are correctly reconstructed without usage of _ a priori _ information .",
    "this has been achieved using precision measurements at the lhc and ilc as input to a global fit exploiting the techniques implemented in the program fittino .",
    "most of the lagrangian parameters can be determined to a precision around the percent level .",
    "for some parameters an accuracy of better than 1  per mil is achievable if theoretical uncertainties are neglected . as a ( very ) conservative estimate",
    "we have re - done the fit using today s theoretical uncertainties .",
    "as expected it turns out that they can significantly deteriorate the precision of the lagrangian parameter determination .",
    "more work is needed to improve the accurary of theoretical predictions in order to fully benefit from the experimental precision .",
    "the only parameter which can not be strongly constrained by the observables used in the presented fit is @xmath39 resulting in a precision of only 25  % for this parameter which translates into an uncertainty of 130  % on @xmath17 .",
    "the strong ( inter - sector ) correlations between the fitted parameters underline the importance of performing a global fit including all sectors of the theory . as shown , fits in parameter subspaces can lead to significant biases and wrong uncertainty estimates .",
    "the fitted parameters at the electroweak scale have been extrapolated to high scales using the bottom - up approach taking into account all correlations between the errors .",
