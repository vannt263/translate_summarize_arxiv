    "<S> we report the experimental observation of multiple dispersive waves emitted in the anomalous dispersion region of an optical fiber from a train of dark solitons . </S>",
    "<S> each individual dispersive wave can be associated to one particular dark soliton of the train , using phase - matching arguments involving higher - order dispersion and soliton velocity . for a large number of dark solitons ( @xmath0 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we observe the formation of a continuum associated with the efficient emission of dispersive waves .    </S>",
    "<S> a bright temporal soliton propagating in the anomalous dispersion region of an optical fiber and in the neighbourhood of the zero - dispersion wavelength ( zdw ) is known to emit a resonant radiation across the zdw ( in normal dispersion region ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical picture associated to this process is as follows : a resonant frequency belonging to a part of the soliton spectral tail overlapping with the normal dispersion region is radiated in the form of a dispersive wave ( dw ) , satisfying a phase - matching condition involving higher - order dispersion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this process has been studied extensively from theoretical and experimental points of views , in particular in the context of supercontinuum generation in photonic crystal fibers ( pcfs ) in which it plays a crucial role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , this process has been shown to occur with non - solitonic pulses propagating in normal dispersion region , thus exciting resonant dws in the anomalous dispersion region @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical explanation for this observation has been provided soon after in terms of phase - matching between the shock - wave front produced from wave breaking in normally dispersive fibers and the resonant dw @xcite . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> phase - matching arguments have to account for the group velocity of the shock front @xcite , whose effect , in the case of anomalous dispersion and bright solitons , is usually negligible with respect to the one of higher - order dispersion .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a few early theoretical studies revealed that dark solitons propagating in normal dispersion region may also radiate resonant dws under the action of third - order dispersion @xcite , which can even initiate the formation of a continuum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , the interaction between a dark soliton and an external dispersive wave has been numerically studied in @xcite . besides these few theoretical studies </S>",
    "<S> , the generation of dws from dark solitons has not been much investigated and has never been observed experimentally .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we report the first experimental observation of the emission of dws from a train of dark solitons . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical analysis reveals that each emitted dw can be identified to one particular dark soliton of the train using a phase - matching relation involving higher - order dispersion and dark soliton velocity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , following numerical predictions from @xcite , we provide an experimental demonstration of the formation of a spectral continuum formed by dws emitted by multiple dark solitons .    a simple method to generate a train of dark soliton consists in launching two delayed co - propagating pulses in a normally dispersive optical fiber @xcite . at the initial stage of propagation , </S>",
    "<S> the two pulses temporally broaden and acquire a linear chirp due to dispersion and self - phase modulation . </S>",
    "<S> once they overlap in time , they interfere forming a pulse with sinusoidally modulated intensity . with further propagation </S>",
    "<S> , this temporal modulation nonlinearly reshapes producing a train of isolated dark pulses , asymptotically approaching fundamental dark solitons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dark pulses behave as quasi - dark solitons , but they are not fundamental dark solitons in the strict sense . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , they either accelerate or decelerate on a variable background and their darkness ( or rather greyness ) changes with propagation . in the following , we chose to term them dark solitons anyway , for the sake of simplicity and clarity .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : setup ] shows a scheme of the experimental setup we have implemented to use this technique . </S>",
    "<S> a ti : sa oscillator delivers gaussian pulses with a full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) duration of 140 fs tunable around 800 nm at 80 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the pulses pass through a variable attenuator made of a half - wave plate and a polarizer and they are directed into an unbalanced michelson interferometer producing a pair of delayed pulses , with a delay adjustable by moving one of the mirrors with a micrometer screw . in each arm , a quarter - wave plate is used to adjust the polarization state resulting in the power control of each pulse after a polarizer placed at the interferometer output . </S>",
    "<S> the final half - wave plate fixes the polarization state of the two pulses to a neutral axis of the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the pulse duration and delay at the fiber input are measured with a noncollinear autocorrelator and the corresponding spectrum is measured with an optical spectrum analyzer . </S>",
    "<S> figures [ fig : setup](b ) and ( c ) show respectively the typical autocorrelation trace and spectrum of the input pulse pair used for the generation of the dark soliton train in the fiber . in this example , the delay was about 500 fs .        the next step of our study is to design a fiber suitable for ( i ) the generation of a train of dark solitons from two delayed 140 fs pulses and ( ii ) the subsequent emission of dws from this dark soliton train . </S>",
    "<S> the fiber must be normally dispersive to allow the formation of dark solitons and its zdw must be close to the emission wavelength of our ti : sa oscillator to allow dw emission . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore used a pcf whose guiding properties were calculated using the empirical model from ref .  </S>",

    "<S> the optimal pump conditions ( wavelength , power , delay ) and fiber properties ( length , dispersion , nonlinearity ) were determined from numerical simulations using the following generalized nonlinear schrdinger equation ( gnsle ) : @xmath1 where the dispersion operator @xmath2 takes into account the full dispersion profile of the fiber and @xmath3 is the nonlinear parameter . </S>",
