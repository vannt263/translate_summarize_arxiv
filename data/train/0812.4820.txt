    "the cern programme in experimental kaon physics of the last decade has been carried out by the na48 series of experiments .",
    "na48 has accomplished several physics subprogrammes based on data taken with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and neutral hyperon beams in 19972004 .",
    "the principal components of the experimental setup ( modified and upgraded in the course of operation ) are a beam line followed by a vacuum decay volume , a magnetic spectrometer consisting of four drift chambers , a trigger scintillator hodoscope , a liquid krypton electromagnetic calorimeter , a hadron calorimeter , and and a muon detector  @xcite .",
    "the present paper reports a number recent precise measurements of cp violation ( cpv ) parameters : 1 ) the indirect cpv parameter @xmath0 with @xmath5 decays ; 2 ) the direct cp violating charge asymmetries of dalitz plot slopes @xmath6 in @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays .",
    "[ eta ] the interest in a precise measurement of the indirect cpv parameter @xmath9 stems , in particular , from the fact that its recent measurements by ktev and kloe experiments published in 2004 and 2006 , respectively , differ by @xmath10 , or more than four standard deviations , from the previous world average .    the na48 measurement of @xmath0  @xcite is based on a data set taken during two days of dedicated running in 1999 . the directly measured quantity is the ratio of the decay rates @xmath11 ; these decays are characterized by similar signatures involving two reconstructed tracks of charged particles . then @xmath0 is computed as @xmath12 in this approach the @xmath2 and @xmath3 lifetimes @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and the branching fractions @xmath15 and @xmath16 are external inputs taken from the best single measurements .",
    "the data sample contains about @xmath17 2-track triggers .",
    "event selection is similar for the @xmath5 and @xmath18 modes .",
    "a crucial difference is electron vs pion identification based on the ratio of particle energy deposition in the em calorimeter to its momentum measured by the spectrometer ( expected to be close to 1 for electrons ) .",
    "particle identification efficiencies were directly measured and corrected for .",
    "samples of @xmath19 @xmath5 and @xmath20 @xmath21 candidates were selected , with about @xmath22 background contamination in each .",
    "acceptance corrections and background subtraction were performed by monte carlo simulation .",
    "trigger efficiencies were measured directly with the data and corrected for .",
    "the most relevant systematic uncertainties come from precision of simulation of kaon momentum spectrum , precision of radiative corrections , and precision of trigger efficiency measurement .",
    "the final result is @xmath23 this leads , subtracting the @xmath24 direct emission contribution , but retaining the inner bremsstrahlung contribution , to @xmath25 finally , the cp violation parameter is computed according to ( [ eta - main ] ) to be @xmath26 the result in in agreement with the recent kloe and ktev measurements , while it contradicts the 2004 pdg average .",
    "the latter disagreement is understood to be due to the improved treatment of the radiative corrections in the recent analyses .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath8 decays are among the most promising processes in kaon physics to search for cpv phenomena .",
    "the decay density is parameterized ( up to radiative and @xmath28 rescattering effects studied separately  @xcite ) by a polynomial expansion @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 are the so called linear and quadratic dalitz plot slope parameters ( @xmath33 ) , and the two lorentz invariant kinematic variables @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined as @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the charged pion mass , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the kaon and pion four - momenta , the indices @xmath40 correspond to the two pions of the same electrical charge , and the index @xmath41 to the pion of different charge .",
    "a non - zero difference @xmath42 between the slope parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 describing the decays of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , is a manifestation of direct cp violation expressed by the corresponding slope asymmetry @xmath47 the above slope asymmetry is expected to be strongly enhanced with respect to the asymmetry of integrated decay rates .",
    "a recent full next - to - leading order chpt computation  @xcite predicts @xmath6 to be of the order of @xmath48 within the sm .",
    "calculations involving processes beyond the sm  @xcite allow a wider range of @xmath6 , including substantial enhancements up to a few @xmath49 .",
    "a measurement of the quantity @xmath6 was performed with a record data sample collected in 200304 with simultaneous @xmath45 and @xmath46 beams  @xcite .",
    "the measurement method is based on the study of ratios of @xmath34 spectra of @xmath45 and @xmath46 decays , and exploits cancellations of major systematic effects due to the simultaneous collection of @xmath45 and @xmath46 decays , and regular inversions of magnetic fields in the beam line and the spectrometric magnet , which allows achieving @xmath50 precision .",
    "the event samples are practically background - free , and contain @xmath51 @xmath27 candidates , and @xmath52 @xmath8 candidates ( the @xmath45/@xmath46 flux ratio , on which however the results do not depend , is 1.8 ) .",
    "the cp violating charge asymmetries of the linear slope parameter of the dalitz plot of the @xmath27 and @xmath8 decays were measured to be @xmath53 the archived precision is more than an order of magnitude better that those of the previous measurements . the results do not show evidences for large enhancements due to non - sm physics , and can be used to constrain certain sm extensions predicting enhanced cpv effects .",
    "a number of recent measurements of cpv parameters in kaon decays by the na48 collaboration at cern are presented .",
    "the achieved precisions are similar to or better than the best previous ones .",
