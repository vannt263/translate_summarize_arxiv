    "it has long been recognized ( see tyson _ et al_.  1984 ) that the gravitational field of a cluster acts on the images of distant galaxies by changing their orientation so that their major axes tend to become perpendicular to the direction of the center of the cluster . in turn",
    "( see kaiser & squires 1993 ) the mean ellipticity of the galaxy images can be used to measure the shear of the lens , a quantity related to the two - dimensional mass distribution ( projected along the line of sight ) . by now a number of reconstruction techniques have been proposed and tested ( see , e.g. , kaiser _",
    "et al_.  1995 ; seitz & schneider 1996 ; hoekstra _ et al_. 1998 ) .    in the reconstruction process ,",
    "information on the ratio of the distances from the observer to the source galaxies and from the lens to the galaxies is used . in practice , in the limit where the galaxies are much farther than the lens ,",
    "the reconstruction process becomes independent of the distance of the source galaxies ( schneider & seitz 1995 , seitz & schneider 1995 ) .",
    "this , of course , is very useful , as usually the redshifts of the sources are not available . if this limit can not be taken ( as it happens if the cluster itself has a relatively high redshift , e.g. , @xmath0 )",
    ", then one has to take into account the different redshifts of the background galaxies .",
    "the result of the gravitational lensing _ does depend _ on the geometry of the universe .",
    "seitz & schneider ( 1997 ) have shown that it is possible to reconstruct the mass distribution of the lens provided that both the probability distribution of galaxy redshifts and the geometry of the universe are known ( e.g. , the values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in the standard friedmann - lematre cosmology ) .",
    "if other data ( in particular , the angular sizes and luminosities of the source galaxies ) are taken to be available , then the problem of the joint determination of the galaxy redshift distribution and of the lens mass density , for an assumed geometry of the universe , can be solved using the so called `` lens parallax method '' ( bartelmann & narayan 1995 ) .",
    "this latter method is based on the decrease of the surface brightness of galaxies and on the corresponding increase of the lens strength with redshift .",
    "a third possibility , of determining the properties of the lens and the geometrical characteristics of the universe from an assumed knowledge of the distances to the source galaxies , is not natural because of the prohibitive demands posed by the measurement of a large number of redshifts .",
    "however , this last option is actually most natural _ in principle _ , given the fact that redshifts are the quantities that can be best measured _",
    "directly_.    in recent years the technique to obtain photometric redshifts ( baum 1962 ) has been greatly improved and tested .",
    "a large number of photometric redshifts of very faint sources ( @xmath3 ) can be obtained without additional telescope time ( with respect to imaging ) . for the hubble deep field more than one",
    "thousand photometric redshifts have been estimated ( lanzetta _ et al_.  1996 ) . moreover",
    ", the technique can be rather accurate ( provided that a good set of filters is used ) . for example , in a first test on a sample of 27 galaxies in the hubble deep field , by comparison with the spectroscopic redshifts now available , more than @xmath4 of the photometric redshifts have errors @xmath5 , and all redshifts have errors @xmath6 ( hogg _ et al_. 1998 ) .",
    "this suggests that in a not far future we might use photometric redshift information for galaxies lensed by a cluster .    in this paper",
    "we show how we can determine both the lens mass distribution and the geometry of the universe if the redshifts of the source galaxies are known .",
    "the method outlined here could be used , in a friedmann - lematre universe , to get information on the density parameter @xmath1 and on the cosmological constant parameter @xmath2 , or could be used to test different cosmologies . at this stage",
    "the study proposed here may be seen as a `` thought experiment '' because of the very high number of redshifts that are found to be required in order to constrain the geometry significantly .",
    "we will show below that the galaxies that one should observe can hardly be found behind a single cluster at the magnitudes currently attainable .",
    "however , it is possible to combine data from different clusters .",
    "combining the study of @xmath7@xmath8 clusters would lead to statistically meaningful constraints .",
    "with such a device , the application of the present method might even become feasible in a not too far future .",
    "surprisingly , simulations show that the method applied to observations considered to be realistic for current plans of the next generation space telescope ( ngst ) should provide significant constraints on the cosmological parameters even if based on a single cluster .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 we recall the main lensing equations generalized to sources at different distances and introduce the `` cosmological weight , '' a quantity that gives the strength of the lens scaled to the relevant distances involved . the reconstruction of the cluster mass distribution and of the cosmological weight is described in sect .",
    "section  4 addresses the issue of the invariance properties associated with the reconstruction analysis .",
    "section  5 introduces the determination of the cosmological parameters by recognizing the limits on the measurement of the cosmological weight .",

    "so far , we have assumed that the shear map @xmath78 , the mass distribution @xmath85 , and the cosmological weight @xmath23 can be determined uniquely .",
    "unfortunately , two invariance properties affect the lensing equations and leave the reconstruction process ambiguous .",
    "the first property is the well known `` sheet - invariance '' ( kaiser & squires 1993 ; schneider & seitz 1995 ) . in the weak lensing limit",
    ", this affects only the dimensionless mass density @xmath85 and has a simple interpretation .",
    "if we add a homogeneous `` sheet '' to the mass density all equations remain unchanged .",
    "the second invariance property , that we call `` global scaling invariance , '' is a new feature associated with the process of the joint determination of the lens mass density and of the cosmological weight .      in this limit",
    "the two invariance properties refer to the transformations ( sheet ) @xmath95 and ( global scaling ) @xmath96 we note that , in the weak lensing limit , the two invariance properties are _ decoupled _ , in the sense that the first involves only the dimensionless density and the second is met in the determination of the cosmological weight ( see sect .",
    "3.1 ) even without considering the estimation of the dimensionless density .",
    "in the general case , the two invariance properties are _ coupled _ , because all three basic quantities @xmath89 , @xmath63 , and @xmath94 have to be determined jointly .",
    "in particular , when the lens is not weak , a new undesired source of uncertainty in the determination of the cosmological weight is introduced by the sheet invariance itself .",
    "the sheet invariance arises because of the differential relation between @xmath78 and @xmath85 .",
    "let us recall the method used to obtain the dimensionless density map @xmath85 from the shear @xmath78 .",
    "first the vector field ( kaiser 1995 ) @xmath97 is calculated from the shear map . as shown by a simple calculation ,",
    "this vector field is the gradient of the mass density , i.e.  @xmath98 .",
    "hence , from the shear @xmath63 , the density @xmath89 can be determined only up to a constant .",
    "this is the usual sheet invariance in the weak lensing limit , where the shear is the observed quantity .    in the general case",
    "one can not measure @xmath78 directly because eq .",
    "( [ gamma - s ] ) , used to obtain the shear , involves the dimensionless mass density .",
    "in addition , a simple generalization to a relation @xmath99 ( see kaiser 1995 and paper  ii ) is not available because of the presence of the cosmological weight ( see , however , seitz & schneider 1997 for an approximate relation ) . thus an iterative process is needed . in the iteration , the arbitrary constant used to invert the vector field @xmath100 into the density map @xmath89 and the cosmological weight act in a complicated manner , which is hard to describe analytically .",
    "if the lens is sub - critical and if the cosmological weight is left unchanged ( i.e.if the outer iteration is not performed , see sect .",
    "3 ) , the sheet invariance can be expressed by ( see appendix  a ) @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the average over the redshifts .",
    "a similar expression has been found by seitz & schneider ( 1997 ) , by considering the sheet invariance in a different context ( the lens reconstruction for a population of galaxies with known redshift distribution ) .",
    "unfortunately , even under the above special conditions , if one introduces the transformation ( [ fischio / fiasco ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ w - s ] ) , the resulting measured cosmological weight @xmath23 changes in a complicated manner .",
    "it can be shown that the related transformation for the cosmological weight can not be reduced to a simple scaling @xmath103 .",
    "the global scaling invariance property is a the same as that encountered in the weak lensing limit ; but here we recall that the three quantities @xmath63 , @xmath94 , and @xmath89 have to be determined jointly .",
    "in particular , if we consider the transformation @xmath104 all equations remain unchanged .",
    "we observe that a similar invariance property is met when one derives information on the geometry of the universe from the separation of multiple images produced by a strong lens .      in conclusion , there are two invariance properties , sheet and global scaling invariance . in the general case ,",
    "both invariance properties affect the determination of the cosmological weight @xmath23 : the global scaling acts as a simple scaling , while the sheet invariance acts in a different and a priori unknown manner .",
    "therefore , to the extent that the impact of the sheet invariance remains out of control , any determination of the cosmological weight would be useless .",
    "this implies that when the lens is not weak we can choose between two possibilities .",
    "either we discard the central part of the cluster , leaving only the parts where the lens is weak , or we must find a way to break the sheet invariance .",
    "as discussed by seitz & schneider ( 1997 ) , there are several possible ways to break the sheet invariance .",
    "a simple and useful method is based on the _ magnification effect _",
    "( broadhurst _ et al_.1995 ) , i.e.  on the observed ( local or total ) number of galaxies . in the case of a single redshift source population ,",

    "( we note that the classification of an observed image is easy once the critical lines can be determined empirically . )    in view of the above discussion , in the following we will always consider either the weak lensing limit or the general case with the sheet mass degeneracy broken .",
    "simulations show that , for the present problem , a ( not too `` strange '' ) lens with @xmath114 everywhere can be considered to be weak , i.e.  to meet the asymptotic requirements @xmath115 .",
    "the global scaling invariance , instead , will be addressed explicitly in the analysis , i.e.  it will be considered present and not broken .",
    "one might think that the global scaling invariance could be broken simply by the use of the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath23 at @xmath116 , i.e.  by setting the cosmological weight equal to unity at high redshifts .",
    "unfortunately , the asymptotic regime is reached only slowly .",
    "thus only galaxies at very high redshifts ( say @xmath117 ) would be useful , which is practically beyond the limits of observations . still , in the discussion of the simulations ( see sect .",
    "6 ) , we will show that the fact that the global scaling invariance , in contrast with the sheet invariance , can be reduced to a simple scaling , allows us to proceed to a meaningful determination of the cosmological parameters ( once the sheet invariance is assumed to be broken ) .",
    "in fact , we will fit the _ shape _ of the measured cosmological weight with a set of cosmological weights ( corresponding to different cosmological parameters ) , leaving unspecified the _ scale _ of the function .",
    "in principle , given a determination of the cosmological weight function @xmath23 from the procedure outlined in sect .",
    "3 , it is straightforward to derive information on the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 that characterize the assumed friedmann - lematre cosmology . in particular , we may resort to a simple least squares or maximum likelihood method .",
    "such a method is able to lead not only to `` point estimations '' of the cosmological parameters , but also to `` interval estimations , '' based on the identification of the relevant `` confidence level '' regions ( see appendix  d ) . in practice , difficulties arise because the determination of @xmath23 will remain incomplete :    * the _ scale _ of the cosmological weight is expected to be _ unknown _ , because of the global scaling invariance described in sect .  4 . * the measurement of @xmath23 is going to be restricted to a _ limited redshift interval _ and we anticipate to be able to do so with only _ limited redshift resolution_. * the measurement of @xmath23 , resulting from the study of a finite number of source galaxies , is going to be affected by _ statistical errors_.    therefore , we now need to determine , for every cosmological model , both the expected _ measured _ cosmological weight @xmath118 and the related error ( covariance matrix ) . as we described in paper  ii , since we are dealing with _ functions _ , either of space @xmath85 or of redshift @xmath23 , the covariance matrix analysis has to be extended to the related two - point correlation functions .",
    "these calculations can be carried out either analytically ( see appendix  c ) or numerically , through monte carlo simulations . in any case , we may anticipate that while an error on the expected measured @xmath119 introduces a _ bias _ in the estimation of the cosmological parameters , an error on the ( co)variance of the cosmological weight is only bound to increase the expected variance of the cosmological parameters thus determined , which is not critical for point estimations .",
    "we refer to a cluster at redshift @xmath120 .",
    "different geometries of the universe set different values for the critical density @xmath121 .",
    "in particular , calling @xmath122 the reduced hubble constant , the case @xmath123 , @xmath31 has @xmath124 , while the case @xmath125 , @xmath126 has @xmath127 . in the following",

    "a wide set of simulations show that the method produces significant results if the number of galaxies studied is a few thousand or more .    the first part of the reconstruction deals with the shear @xmath78 and with the mass distribution @xmath85 .",

    "simulations show that the number of outer iterations needed to obtain a good estimation of the cosmological weight is very low , say @xmath194 , because the method is able to give the correct shear map after the first inner loop .",

    "the estimated cosmological weight @xmath69 ( solid lines in fig .",
    "4 ) is smooth on the characteristic scale of @xmath80 ( see eq .  ( [ < w > ] ) ) ; because of this , it remains at a finite value at @xmath195 .",
    "moreover , as expected , the error on the cosmological weight increases slightly for @xmath12 near @xmath9 and more for high values of @xmath12 , where the number of galaxies decreases ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "in particular , the smoothing of the cosmological weight is very important near the cluster , at @xmath196 , where the true cosmological weight vanishes abruptly .",

    "we argue that @xmath204 can be considered as a lower bound for the applicability of our method .",
    "these figures also show that , unless an exceedingly high number of source galaxies is available , point estimation is not very meaningful .",
    "in fact , these examples show that the minimum of the @xmath205 function can occur quite far from the true values of the cosmological parameters . on the other hand , for not unreasonable ( see discussion in sect .",
    "7 ) values of @xmath58 , the method does _ constrain _ the cosmological parameters .",
    "if additional a priori conditions are included ( e.g. , if the universe is taken to have @xmath31 ) , parameters can be constrained rather efficiently .    in order to check the distribution of @xmath201",
    ", we have repeated a large number of times the entire process , using each time a different set of source galaxies .",
    "the measured probability distribution of @xmath201 for different values of @xmath58 is shown in figs .  7 and 8 .",
    "in these figures , the histograms show the number of simulations that have produced a value of @xmath201 in the corresponding interval .",
    "intervals are chosen so that the theoretical number of events per bin is constant . from these and other results not shown",
    "it is clear that @xmath201 tends to a chi - square distribution with two degrees of freedom only for a very large number of galaxies @xmath58 , say @xmath206 . in contrast , for `` small '' values of @xmath58 the observed distribution is ( approximately ) consistent with a chi - square with one degree of freedom .",
    "this suggests that , when the number of galaxies is small , a new approximate invariance may be present .",
    "the method is able to break this invariance for larger values of @xmath58 .",
    "this behavior is also suggested by the shapes of the confidence regions of figs .  5 and 6 .",
    "in fact , the confidence regions obtained have a characteristic shape approximately following the lines @xmath207 .",
    "thus our method should be able to constrain well the curvature @xmath208 , while the quantity @xmath209 should remain practically unknown , at least when the number @xmath58 of galaxies used is not too high .",
    "this approximate invariance may explain the behavior of the quantity @xmath201 for finite @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , if the invariance were exact , @xmath201 would be expected to follow a chi - square distribution with ( only ) one degree of freedom .",
    "this is indeed observed for @xmath210 .",
    "thus in order to draw the confidence regions , one should use the results of monte carlo simulations , unless the number @xmath58 of galaxies is _ very _ large .",
    "the contours presented in this paper have been obtained from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the use of the asymptotic limit would have led indeed to _ larger _ confidence regions .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the applicability of our method to observations .",
    "as noted earlier , the main difficulty with our method is probably the high number of galaxies ( and redshifts ) needed to obtain significant constraints on the geometry of the universe .    in order to show that the examples chosen for our simulations can be considered to be not unrealistic ,",
    "we first note that the required density of galaxies is between @xmath211 and @xmath212 galaxies per square arcminute .",
    "this density is certainly too high for current instruments .",
    "in fact , the current achievable density of galaxies ( with `` reasonable '' integration times ) is of the order of @xmath213 galaxies per square arcminute ( clowe _ et al_. 1998 ) , and this number is only likely to double with the advanced camera on hst .",
    "however , current estimates for ngst ( stiavelli _ et al_. 1997 ) give more than @xmath214 galaxies per square arcminute .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the baseline for the camera currently considered for ngst is about @xmath215 , not far from the value used in our simulations ( @xmath216 ) .",
    "a second difficulty with the method proposed here is the large number of redshifts required .",
    "as suggested in the introduction , photometric redshifts might be used . in this case , however , sizable statistical errors on the measured redshifts are expected . at this stage , for simplicity , such errors have not been taken into account in the simulations , but they obviously should be considered in detail before applications are tried .",
    "( we note also that errors on the measurement of ellipticities may have an impact , especially if small and weak source galaxies are used . )",
    "another important ingredient is the cluster chosen in our simulations . in an einstein - de  sitter universe with @xmath136",
    ", the cluster would have a mass within a @xmath137 aperture of about @xmath217 .",
    "we may compare our cluster with the x - ray cluster ms @xmath218 located at @xmath219 ( luppino & kaiser 1997 ) ; weak lensing estimates for this cluster give a mass within @xmath137 in the range @xmath220 and @xmath221 , depending on the assumed redshift distribution for the source galaxies .    in conclusion",
    ", the proposed method should give interesting results if applied to ngst observations .",
    "of course , several refinements and improvements would be required for the purpose .",
    "for example , as suggested in the introduction , the use of several clusters should provide tighter constraints on the cosmological parameters .",
    "broadly speaking , the use of @xmath222 similar clusters should make the errors on the cosmological parameters smaller by a factor @xmath223 .",
    "however , for this purpose the method should be generalized to be applied to different clusters at different redshifts ( actually , we expect that if the redshifts of the clusters are different , more information on the geometry of the universe is available )",
    ". we should also keep in mind that , intuitively , the use of several clusters may introduce additional difficulties , much like the case of a single cluster with pronounced substructure .",
    "finally , we should stress that a potential problem for the application of our method could be that of multiple lensing .",
    "in fact , if weak lensing analysis is used ( in order to solve the problem of the sheet invariance ) , `` tidal '' effects of other clusters ( or from large scale structures ) could become important and may jeopardize the applicability of the method . on the other hand , it is often very hard to break the sheet invariance . in view of the above considerations",
    ", it would be very interesting to develop a method able to overcome these problems , possibly by decoupling the sheet and the global scaling invariance properties .",
    "in this paper we have proposed and discussed a method , based on weak lensing and redshift observations , to reconstruct the lens mass distribution and to obtain , at the same time , information on the geometry of the universe .",
    "simulations based on the homogeneous friedmann - lematre models have shown that the method is viable when the number of source galaxies is sufficiently high . in principle , the same method could be extended to other cosmological models , provided that the angular diameter - distance relation be available ; some of these would be harder to handle because they involve a larger number of free parameters ( e.g. , the inhomogeneous `` in average '' friedmann - lematre models ; see kayser _",
    "et al_.  1997 ) .",
    "in this paper we have used a `` parameter - free '' approach in the determination of the cosmological weight .",
    "in fact , in the reconstruction process we have tried to determine the values of @xmath23 for a number of different redshifts ( 25 in our simulations ) , without any assumption on its shape .",
    "a different method could have been used , namely the direct determination of the cosmological parameters without the intermediate determination of the cosmological weight @xmath23 ( parametric approach ) . in this case",
    "the cosmological parameters could have been estimated using , for example , a maximum likelihood method . a similar dichotomy exists between parametric and non - parametric mass reconstructions .",
    "we have decided to use here the non - parametric approach as more `` conservative , '' but it would be interesting to develop a parametric method in detail for comparison .",
    "one improvement that could be made on the current method is based on more direct use of the shear in the determination of the cosmological weight ( see eq .",
    "( [ w ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , the complex shear @xmath78 is not an independent quantity , in the sense that a relation between its partial derivatives holds ( i.e. , @xmath224 ; see paper  ii for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "hence it is natural to expect that the inclusion of an additional relation , not considered in the present paper , could improve the determination of @xmath23 .",
    "this might be implemented by resorting to a maximum likelihood approach for the measurement of the shear map .",
