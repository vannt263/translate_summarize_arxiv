    "products of common envelope evolution play important roles in many areas of modern astronomy , e.g. stellar black hole binaries as laboratories for general relativity , double - degenerate white dwarf binaries as potential progenitors of type ia supernovae , or double - degenerate neutron star binaries as progenitors of short gamma ray bursts .",
    "the fundamental concept of the formation of such systems is well established : once the more massive star in a main - sequence binary evolves into a red giant , unstable mass transfer is initiated at a rate that exceeds the eddington limit of the companion star , and leads to the formation of a common envelope around the giant core and its less massive main sequence companion @xcite .",
    "drag forces between the binary components and the material of the envelope lead then to a dramatic decrease of the binary separation , and the orbital energy released due to the shrinkage of the orbit eventually expels the envelope exposing a post common - envelope binary ( pceb ) .    pcebs continue to evolve to even shorter orbital periods through angular momentum loss given by magnetic braking and/or gravitational wave emission , and may either undergo a second common envelope , leading to double - degenerate pcebs , or enter a semi - detached state and appear as cataclysmic variables , super - soft x - ray sources , or x - ray binaries . because of the complex physical processes , and wide range of physical and time scales involved in the common envelope evolution , our understanding of this important phase is still very poor , and severely under - constrained by observations .    among the variety of pcebs , white dwarf - main sequence ( wdms )",
    "binaries are intrinsically the most common , and structurally simplest population , and hold a strong promise to provide crucial observational input that is necessary for improving the theory of close binary evolution @xcite .",
    "wdms binaries descend from main sequence binaries where the primary has a mass @xmath2 . in the majority of cases ( @xmath33/4 )",
    "the initial main sequence binary separation is large enough for the white dwarf precursor to evolve in the same way as a single star @xcite , and consequently the orbital period of these systems will increase because of the mass loss of the primary . in the remaining @xmath31/4 of the cases ,",
    "the system enters a common envelope , leading to a drastically shorter orbital period .",
    "the orbital period distribution of the entire population of wdms binaries is therefore expected to be strongly bi - modal , with the short orbital period pcebs clearly separated from the long orbital period wdms binaries that did not undergo common envelope evolution .",
    "this seems to be confirmed by a recent high - resolution imaging campaign of 90 white dwarfs with known or suspected low - mass stellar and sub - stellar companions @xcite .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been very efficient at identifying large numbers of wdms binaries @xcite , with 1602 systems in data release ( dr)6 @xcite .",
    "intense radial velocity studies have led to the identification of a large number of pcebs among the sample of sdss wdms binaries @xcite .",
    "a few examples of the work already done with both the entire sample of sdss wdms binaries , as well as the subset of systems identified to be pcebs is the identification of many eclipsing pcebs , important for testing the models of stellar structure @xcite ; observational constraints on the efficiency of the common envelope @xcite ; strong evidence for a discontinuity in the strength of magnetic braking near the fully convective boundary @xcite ; and an unambiguous demonstration that the majority of low - mass ( he - core ) white dwarfs are formed in binaries @xcite .    here ,",
    "we present the final catalogue of wdms binaries identified from sdss ( dr7 ) spectroscopy , discuss the global properties of the 2248 systems , and describe a public interactive on - line data base of spectroscopic sdss wdms binaries .",
    "during its first phase of operations , 2000 to 2005 , sdss - i mainly obtained spectra of galaxies and quasars selected from 5700 square degrees of imaging .",
    "the corresponding data largely dominate the dr6 of sdss @xcite . from 2005 to 2008 , sdss - ii carried out three distinct surveys :    * the sloan legacy survey , that completed the original ( mainly extragalactic ) sdssi imaging and spectroscopic goals ; * segue , ( the sdss extension for galactic understanding and exploration , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that probed the structure and history of the milky way , obtaining additional imaging over a large range of galactic latitudes as well as spectroscopy for @xmath4 stars ; * and the sloan supernova survey , that carried out repeat imaging of the 300 square degree southern equatorial stripe to discover and measure supernovae and other variable objects .",
    "the final data product of sdssi and most of sdssii is dr7 @xcite .",
    "the different design of sdssii and in particular the inclusion of a dedicated target selection for wdms binaries in segue significantly changes the resulting wdms binary star content compared to dr6 .",
    "below we review the two main channels that led to wdms binary spectra taken by sdss .",
    "the main science driver of sdssi has been to acquire spectroscopy for magnitude - limited samples of galaxies @xcite and quasars @xcite .",
    "because of their composite nature , wdms binaries form a `` bridge '' in colour space that connects the white dwarf locus to that of low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the blue end of the bridge , characterised by wdms binaries with hot white dwarf and/or late type companions , strongly overlaps with the colour locus of quasars , and was therefore intensively targeted by sdss spectroscopy . in contrast , the red end of the bridge is totally dominated by wdms binaries containing cool white dwarfs , and excluded from the quasar program .",
    "some additional wdms binaries were directly selected for sdss spectroscopy following the selection criteria of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these criteria are based on the idea that a wdms binary needs to be both red ( main sequence ) and blue ( white dwarf ) , which is only true for a relatively small fraction of possible wdms binary colours . in particular , systems in which one of the stellar components dominates the emission",
    "are excluded . in summary",
    ", the overall sdssi spectroscopic sample of wdms binaries @xcite is heavily biased against wdms binaries containing cold white dwarfs and/or early - type secondaries , just as @xcite found for the pre - sdss sample .      within sdssii",
    ", the legacy project is expected to identify wdms binaries with similar properties , and at a similar rate as within sdssi . however ,",
    "segue included a small number of projects targeting specific classes of objects , and we have developed a colour selection to find wdms binaries containing either cool white dwarfs and/or early m - dwarf / late k - dwarf companions , i.e. a population of wdms binaries that has been consistently under - represented in the sdssi and all the previous surveys .    to that end",
    "we simulated @xmath5 colours of wdms binaries spanning a broad range in white dwarf effective temperatures ( @xmath6k ) and companion star spectral types ( k0m6 ) ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "absolute johnson @xmath7 magnitudes for white dwarfs and for m / k dwarfs were taken from an updated version of @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the combined @xmath7 magnitudes were converted to @xmath5 using the empirical colour transformations of @xcite .",
    "fig.[g : segcol ] shows the loci of the synthetic sdss wdms binary colours in three different colour - colour diagrams ( @xmath8 vs. @xmath9 , @xmath9 vs. @xmath10 , and @xmath10 vs. @xmath11 ) and demonstrates that systems dominated by the thermal flux of the secondary star can be separated from quasars ( yellow dots ) , main sequence stars ( grey dots ) , and wdms binaries dominated by the thermal flux of the white dwarf by applying the following cuts :"
