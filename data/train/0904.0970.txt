    "one of the important fields of modern ionospheric investigations is the study of small - scale irregularities in e- and f- layers of the ionosphere , that affect radiowave propagation and functionality of different hf and uhf radiotools .",
    "one of the most investigated types of irregularities is e- and f- layer irregularities produced as a result of growth of two - stream and gradient - drift instabilities .",
    "the theory of such instabilities is under development for a long time but still is not finished @xcite .",
    "the usual condition for the growth of such irregularities is the requirement of different velocities of electrons and ions , most significant at altitudes 80 - 120 km . at these heights ions",
    "are unmagnetized - their motion is controlled by neutral component motion . at the same time the electrons motion is controlled by auxiliary electric and magnetic fields - electrons are magnetized @xcite .",
    "but it is clear that this requirement significantly limits the validity region of the current instabilities theories , that is why it is important to obtain a theory of ionacoustic instabilities without this limitation ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "as basic equations for obtaining dispersion relation we will use two - fluid magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations in form @xcite :    @xmath0    where @xmath1 , normalized elastic collision frequencies :    @xmath2    @xmath3 is effective mass of charged particles during elastic collisions with neutrals ( for electrons @xmath4 is very close to electron mass , for ions @xmath5 could vary around half of ion mass ) :    @xmath6    and @xmath7 - elastic collision frequency of the ions ( electrons ) with neutrals .",
    "we also suppose here that the charged particles do not interact with each other through the collisions and interact only through electromagnetic field .",
    "we also exclude all the viscidity effects , that usually are not taken into account @xcite . in this case",
    "we take into consideration ( following to the @xcite ) only elastic collisions . in detail",
    "the approximations used are listed in appendix a. most of these approximations are valid at heights below 200 km both for quiet and disturbed ionospheric conditions .",
    "it must also be noted , that we throw out a lot of terms from the mhd equations ( [ eq:2.1.1 ] ) : ambient magnetic @xmath8 and electric @xmath9 fields are supposed to be constant ; any magnetic field variations are not taken into consideration ; gravitation field is not taken into consideration ; recombination and ionization processes are not taken into consideration ; neutral component motion is neglected .",
    "this allows us to neglect a lot of instabilities and effects ( see , for example @xcite ) and simplify the analysis .",
    "zero order approximation connects nondisturbed ( quasihomogeneous and static ) values of the particles density @xmath10 , average motion speed @xmath11 , ambient electrical @xmath9 and magnetic @xmath8 fields and collision frequencies .",
    "when density , fields and collision frequencies are given , the zero order approximation defines average motion speed of charged particles in any point of space and time .    as one can see from ( [ eq:2.1.1 ] ) , the zero - order approximation is defined by the system :    @xmath12    in the simplest case of weak velocity gradients , when we could neglect lagrange term @xmath13 , the system ( [ eq:3.2.1 ] ) has a well known solution @xcite :    @xmath14    where operators of diffusion @xmath15 , thermodiffusion @xmath16 and conductivity @xmath17 are :    @xmath18\\label{eq:3.2.3}\\ ] ]    @xmath19\\label{eq:3.2.4}\\ ] ]    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    and functions @xmath26 are tabulated ( for example in @xcite ) for taking into account not only mhd effects , but kinetic effects too .",
    "it is important to note that for our next consideration the exact expression ( [ eq:3.2.2 ] ) for zero - order solution is not very significant for us , and below we only suggest that the solution @xmath27 exists and is unambiguously determined by its arguments .",
    "so by the zero - order solution we mean an equation ( [ eq:3.2.1 ] ) that defines an average motion speed @xmath11 as a function of ambient conditions and which could be solved analytically ( [ eq:3.2.2]-[eq:3.2.8 ] ) in simple cases or numerically in more complex cases .",
    "one of standard approaches to the mhd equations analysis is a geometrooptical ( go ) approximation , the validity of which is defined by smallness of the parameter    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is irregularities wave vector and @xmath30 typical range of changes of parameter @xmath31 ( for example electron density ) .",
    "when the go approximation is valid , the solution for small variations of the parameters @xmath32 can be found in form :    @xmath33    geometrooptical phase @xmath34 ( or eikonal ) for plane waves is related to wave vector @xmath29 and complex frequency of the wave @xmath35 by the following definitions :    @xmath36    the first approximation gave us the system of equations :    @xmath37    where , by taking into account the zero - order approximation ( [ eq:3.2.1 ] ) :    @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    @xmath45    to make the following analysis easier , the system ( [ eq:3.3.1 ] ) is written in operator form , where operators @xmath46 are matrix operators in partial derivatives over the eikonal @xmath47 .",
    "it is clear that in this form the system looks pretty simple and solvable .",
    "from ( [ eq:3.3.1 ] ) one can see that the system is linear and , in case of existence and uniqueness of the inverse operator @xmath48 ( [ eq:3.3.7 ] ) it can be solved . after excluding @xmath49 from ( [ eq:3.3.1 ] ) the equation connecting the density @xmath50 and electric potential @xmath51 variations has the following form :    @xmath52    where coefficients are :    @xmath53    and @xmath54 - an arbitrary function of arbitrary parameters that does not have zero values at the investigated region .",
    "now we can recall that our plasma has two types of particles and its characteristics are defined by the system of equations :    @xmath55    sometimes , for example , when analyzing thermal variations of electron density ( that cause incoherent scattering ) , the self - coordinated term @xmath56 in ( [ eq:3.4.3 ] ) can not be neglected - scatterers size has order of debye length and this term becomes significant .",
    "but in this very task we can neglect this term , following to many authors ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that existence of solution of ( [ eq:3.4.3 ] ) is determined by consistency of these equations .",
    "the consistency condition in our case has the following form :    @xmath57    it connects different partial derivatives over the eikonal @xmath47 with each other and can be referred as dispersion relation . as one can see , the dispersion relation has symmetrical ( as it was expected earlier ) form .",
    "it is clear that existence of dispersion relation and its exact form ( [ eq:3.4.4 ] ) depend on existence and properties of inverse operator @xmath48 .",
    "as it has been shown in appendix b , the inverse operator can be easily found in case when lagrange term @xmath58 in @xmath59 can be neglected .",
    "below we call this approximation as irregularities under approximation of quasihomogeneous velocity ( iaqv ) . as preliminary analysis has shown , this approximation is valid for wavenumbers 0.1 - 10 @xmath60 under most ionospheric conditions at altitudes below 200 km and for variations of average parameters not faster than 100 m ( for faster changes the go approximation becomes incorrect ) .    in the iaqv approximation",
    "the inverse operator @xmath59 has the following simple form :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 - unity vector in direction of @xmath63 ( and antiparallel to the magnetic field ) .",
    "it must be noted that iaqv approximation does not mean neglecting the lagrange term @xmath64 in basic equations ( [ eq:2.1.1 ] ) , but only neglecting @xmath65 term in operator @xmath59 ( [ eq:3.3.7 ] ) , all the other terms are the same .",
    "summarizing , the dispersion relation in iaqv approximation has the following form ( [ eq:3.4.4 ] , [ eq:3.3.3]-[eq:3.3.9 ] , [ eq:3.5.1 ] ) .",
    "let us briefly analyze the structure of the dispersion relation by defining function that does not have zeroes :    @xmath66    this leads to the following coefficients of the dispersion relation ( [ eq:3.4.4 ] ) :    @xmath67    when taking into account ( [ eq:3.3.3]-[eq:3.3.9 ] ) it becomes clear that coefficients ( [ eq:4.1.2 ] ) are polynomials over the @xmath68 and have the form :    @xmath69    from this consideration it becomes clear that dispersion relation ( [ eq:3.4.4 ] ) is a 6th order polynomial over the @xmath68 and has no more than 6 solutions .      to simplify the solution technique in homogeneous case , in the work @xcite",
    "a new complex variable was defined :    @xmath70    in our inhomogeneous case we define the following new variables :    @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    @xmath74    in this case the operators ( [ eq:3.3.3]-[eq:3.3.9 ] ) become :    @xmath75    @xmath76    @xmath77    @xmath78    @xmath79    @xmath80    @xmath81    where * is a complex conjugation .",
    "summarizing , the dispersion relation has the form ( [ eq:3.4.4 ] ) , where its coefficients are defined by ( [ eq:4.1.2],[eq:4.2.2]-[eq:4.2.12 ] )",
    "the vectors @xmath82 in dispersion relation are parallel in case of homogeneous ionosphere and not parallel in case of inhomogeneous ionosphere . after substituting @xmath82 ( [ eq:4.2.7]-[eq:4.2.9 ] ) into ( [ eq:4.1.2 ] ) and taking into account the properties of vector product we obtain the following :    @xmath83    the first two terms in each relation ( [ eq:4.2.17 ] ) are the terms that correspond both to the inhomogeneous and homogeneous dispersion relations , the last terms correspond only to changes of dispersion relation due to inhomogeneities presence .",
    "it is clear that in both cases ( gradients are parallel to the magnetic field and gradients are perpendicular to the magnetic field ) the difference between dispersion relation for homogeneous case and for inhomogeneous one does exist .",
    "but if the gradients are weak enough ( or wavenumbers are high enough ) we can neglect the changes of dispersion relation and solve only simplified one , that corresponds to the homogeneous case :    @xmath84    as one can see , this approximation is valid , when :    @xmath85    @xmath86    @xmath87    the condition ( [ eq:4.2.18b ] ) is equivalent to the go validity condition ( [ eq:2.2.1 ] ) :    @xmath88    the condition ( [ eq:4.2.18c ] ) is valid when analyzing scattering almost perpendicular to the magnetic field or when gradients are sufficiently small :    @xmath89    and the last condition ( [ eq:4.2.18d ] ) is valid when gradients are small enough :    @xmath90    so the condition ( [ eq:4.2.18b ] ) is always valid , condition ( [ eq:4.2.18c ] ) is valid when we investigate the instabilities near the perpendicular to the magnetic field and the condition ( [ eq:4.2.18e ] ) becomes only critical limitation for the approximation ( [ eq:4.2.18 ] ) of initial formula ( [ eq:4.2.17 ] ) .      to create a correct dispersion relation for heights 80 - 200 km",
    "we should choose the correct approximations for ionospheric plasma .",
    "the most important plasma parameters are thermal velocities , hyrofrequencies and frequencies of collisions with neutrals .",
    "these approximate parameters are shown at the table 1 ( calculated for mid - latitude ionosphere using models msis , igrf and iri )    we also suggest that wavenumbers are within 0.1 - 10 m ( sounding frequencies 15 - 1500mhz ) , and drift velocities @xmath11 do not exceed 3000 m/s .",
    "it is clear , that at altitudes 80 - 200 km the following approximations are valid : @xmath91 - electron hyrofrequency much higher than their thermal speed ; @xmath92 - electron hyrofrequency much higher than their average speed ( even in disturbed conditions ) ; @xmath93 - electron thermal speed much higher than their average speed ; @xmath94 electron - neutral collision frequency is much higher than ion - neutral one ; we also use weakly inhomogeneous ionosphere approximation : @xmath95    below there is a list of traditional approximations that are valid for e - layer @xcite , but is not valid for the whole region 80 - 200 km : @xmath96 - is not valid for ions at altitudes above 120 km , not valid for electrons at heights above 180 km under very disturbed conditions ; @xmath97 - is not valid for disturbed conditions ; @xmath98 - is not valid above 120 km ; @xmath99 - is not valid at and below 80 km .",
    "it also must be noted that during high disturbances the effective ion - neutral collision frequency @xmath100 , that is used in dispersion relation , becomes dependent on electron density gradient and average ions velocity ( [ eq:4.2.5 ] ) and might be increased ( or decreased ) depending on the ion motion direction and gradients .",
    "it should be also noted that for high velocities the effective ion - neutral collision frequency @xmath100 at heights approximately above 140 - 160 km can become zero or negative .",
    "so , in this case the traditional approximation @xcite of low doppler drifts @xmath101 is also invalid .      by substituting ( [ eq:4.2.6],[eq:4.2.10],[eq:4.2.11 ] ) into ( [ eq:4.2.18 ] ) and after neglecting same non - zero multipliers :    @xmath102    where    @xmath103    is hyrofrequency .",
    "let us define new index @xmath104 to describe another charged component : @xmath105 .",
    "after defining the new parameters    @xmath106    @xmath107    we will obtain the relations for second charged component as a function of the same parameter @xmath108 :    @xmath109    below we will analyze the dispersion relation ( [ eq:3.4.4 ] ) in form :    @xmath110    where    @xmath111    by substituting ( [ eq:4.3.2],[eq:4.3.5 ] ) into ( [ eq:4.3.6 ] ) , after neglecting non - zero multiplier , for single - charged ions ( @xmath112 ) ( most frequent approximation in this region of altitudes ) the dispersion relation becomes the final one :    @xmath113    where    @xmath114    and other parameters are defined by ( [ eq:4.2.2]-[eq:4.2.5],[eq:4.3.4],[eq:4.3.4b ] ) and by solution of the zero - order approximation ( [ eq:3.2.1 ] ) .    from obtained solution @xmath115 of dispersion relation ( [ eq:4.3.7 ] ) for given altitude dependence of the parameters one can always obtain the actual irregularity frequencies and decrements using relation :    @xmath116    from the dispersion relation ( [ eq:4.3.7],[eq:4.3.8],[eq:4.3.1 ] ) it becomes clear that in the first approximation the presence of gradients @xmath117 of electron density logarithm change decrement ( imaginary part of @xmath118 ) , changes effective collision frequencies for ions with neutrals and makes them anisotropic at high altitudes .",
    "all these changes are proportional to the scalar product of the gradient of the electron density logarithm and average electron velocity .",
    "actually this fact contradicts with current theories suggesting that in most cases only the electron density gradients perpendicular to the magnetic field must be taken into account @xcite , since there could be conditions when @xmath11 is not perpendicular to the magnetic field , for example in case of non - perpendicular magnetic and electric fields .        the dispersion relation ( [ eq:4.3.7 ] )",
    "has 6 solutions , and in basic case all the solutions can be found only numerically .",
    "lets find the simplest approximate solution - nearest to zero .",
    "the solution nearest to zero has a clear physical sence : in absence of average plasma drifts and gradients plasma can be supposed as static and irregularities should be static , i.e.    @xmath119    in presence of weak drifts and gradients we can suppose that the solution is close to zero .    to find the solution nearest to zero we will use zero order newton solution ( see , for example @xcite ) :    @xmath120    by substituting the basic relations :    @xmath121    @xmath122    the low - frequency branch ( [ eq:4_.3.16],[eq:4_.3.7],[eq:4_.3.8 ] ) is pretty complex so we will investigate it at different ionospheric heights .",
    "let us analyze the branch ( [ eq:4_.3.16],[eq:4_.3.7],[eq:4_.3.8 ] ) for the typical ionospheric heights 80 - 120 km . within standard for e - layer assumptions of @xmath123 , magnetized electrons and unmagnetized ions , and neglecting @xmath124",
    ", we obtain following equations for function and its first differential ( neglecting in first differential by all the terms , proportional to @xmath125 or @xmath126 , based on suggestion that doppler shifts for ionacoustic or average velocities are sufficiently small in comparison with @xmath100 ) :    @xmath127    @xmath128    from ( [ eq:5.3],[eq:5.1 ] ) and newton method ( [ eq:4_.3.16 ] ) we obtain the solution , nearest to zero :    @xmath129    considering ( [ eq:4.3.1 ] ) we obtain the following solution for plasma irregularities :    @xmath130    @xmath131    in gradient - free case the solution ( [ eq:5.6 ] ) looks exactly as the standard one @xcite , in presence of gradients the solution differs from the standard one , most probably due to custom direction of gradients and custom orientation of velocities .",
    "let us analyze the branch ( [ eq:4_.3.16],[eq:4_.3.7],[eq:4_.3.8 ] ) in case of sufficiently high altitudes , when both types of charged particles are magnetized ( i.e. from about 130 - 140 km ) . at high altitudes we can neglect the difference in electron and ion velocities in comparison with their absolute values ( both components are magnetized and move with almost the same velocities ) :    @xmath132    supposing @xmath133 , and when investigating wavevectors perpendicular to the magnetic field , the solution becomes simplier :    @xmath134    @xmath135    after simple arithmetic and by taking into account magnetized plasma and typical ionospheric conditions ( @xmath136- electrons ) :    @xmath137    we have :    @xmath138    @xmath139    taking into account the typical ionospheric conditions :    @xmath140    @xmath141    @xmath142    from ( [ eq:4.3.20 ] ) the condition for the growing solution @xmath143 becomes :    @xmath144    where    @xmath145    is the so called coefficient of ambipolar diffusion @xcite .    for typical ionospheric conditions the growth condition ( [ eq:4.3.21 ] ) can be estimated as :    @xmath146\\left|\\overrightarrow{k}\\right|^{2}\\label{eq:4.3.22}\\ ] ]    the spectral offset for these irregularities ( [ eq:4.3.20 ] ) is exactly the doppler drift in crossed fields ( and defined by zero - order solution ( [ eq:3.2.1]-[eq:3.2.2 ] ) ) :    @xmath147    it is necessary to note that the solution is obtained in weak gradients approximation ( [ eq:4.2.18e ] ) valid when :    @xmath148    it should be noted that possible relation of the ambipolar diffusion with irregularities existence at these heights has been noted in @xcite , but the problem was not investigated in detail .",
    "the close condition for irregularities growth at high altitudes @xmath149 was also obtained by @xcite , but with another proportionality coefficient @xmath150 and in qualitative analysis of a model case .",
    "due to the solution ( [ eq:4.3.20 ] ) corresponds to the same branch ( [ eq:4_.3.16],[eq:4_.3.7],[eq:4_.3.8 ] ) as well - known gradint - drift instabilities ( [ eq:5.6],[eq:5.7 ] ) , below we will call this kind of solition as fully magnetized gradient - drift instabilities ( fmgd ) to stress that this is the same gradient - drift branch but in a bit different conditions .",
    "starting from early 1960s @xcite at equatorial hf and uhf radars researchers observe an unique type of echo , the so called 150 km equatorial one .",
    "there are some theories to explain it ( for example @xcite ) , but the exact physical mechanism of it is still unclear @xcite .",

    ", some modelling has been done using the latest internation refference ionosphere ( iri-2007 ) model .",
    "the height and time dependence of the electron density gradients are most important for the generation of this type of irregularities .",
    "we have analyzed 13 years period ( 1990 - 2002 ) using iri model ( for typical non - disturbed conditions @xmath155 ) and obtained the following results .    at fig.1",

    "as one can see , the time dependence of the gradients has a most intensive maximum between 14:00 and 19:00 ut ( 9:00 - 14:00lt ) .",
    "this also corresponds well with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the dependence of irregularities frequency ( [ eq:4.3.23 ] ) corresponds well with the empirical models @xcite and allows to interpret the experimental data as doppler frequency offset due to electron drift in crossed fields .    according to the experimental observations , the echo starts with @xmath158 , according to our calculations",

    ", the acoustic - gravitational waves will produce gradients more than @xmath154 , and this will produce this type of irregularities even at lower velocities , for example at @xmath158 . another possible mechanism that will lower the velocities necessary for generation of the instability is an observation of high step - like gradients at these heights from the rocket data ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "they should also produce the increase of @xmath156 high enough for lowering the speed limit .    summarizing all",

    "in the paper within the approximation of the two - fluid magnetohydrodynamics and geometrooptical approximation the dispersion relation ( [ eq:4.3.7 ] , [ eq:4.3.8 ] , [ eq:4.2.2]-[eq:4.2.5 ] ) at 80 - 200 km altitudes was obtained .",
