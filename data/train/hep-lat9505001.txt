    "while some investigations have been devoted to the polymer expansion of the fermion determinant in the case of staggered fermions @xcite@xcite to date almost no attention has been paid to the corresponding case of wilson fermions @xcite due to the additional difficulties involved in general . however , while in the strong coupling limit the system with staggered fermions ( qcd , qed ) reduces to a pure monomer - dimer system @xcite the same is not true for wilson fermions as the investigation of salmhofer @xcite demonstrates .",
    "the equivalence of the strong coupling lattice schwinger model with wilson fermions to a self - avoiding loop model enables certain methods used in other branches of physics , e.g. in condensed matter physics ( polymers , defect mediated phase transitions ) and in cosmic string physics , to be exploited in its investigation @xcite@xcite . at the same time , its equivalence ( in another language ) to some 8-vertex model @xcite makes further results available . + self - avoiding loop models @xcite , @xcite have a long history due to their prominent role in polymer physics as well as their attraction as a simple problem of non - markovian nature .",

    "it is established that the phase transition is ising - like , i.e. , the model experiences a second order phase transition with exactly the same critical exponents as the regular ising model . by the argument of universality",
    "we may conclude that neighbouring models which lie on the same critical line exhibit the same behaviour .",
    "this in particular concerns the ordinary loop model ( @xmath50 ) and the strong coupling schwinger model ( @xmath0 ) . for the ordinary loop model this has been confirmed by mc investigations in the past @xcite . for the strong coupling schwinger model",
    "this consideration specifies the so far unknown character of the phase transition and confirms the recent suggestion that the transition might be a continuous one @xcite .",
    "+ in order to extend the understanding of the self - avoiding loop model with variable bending rigidity at criticality let us consider the central charge @xmath159 of the corresponding conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "helpful information can be obtained most easily for the free fermion model considered in sect .",
    ", it seems worthwhile mentioning that the regular ising model can be understood as a special free fermion model @xcite .",
    "a preliminary investigation along the lines given for the ising model in @xcite indicates that the self - avoiding loop model with bending rigidity @xmath2 can be represented at the critical point @xmath125 by just one massless ( continuum ) majorana fermion ( as in the special case of the ising model just one half of the fermionic modes needed to express the partition function becomes massless at the critical point . ) .",
    "consequently , this suggests that the critical self - avoiding loop model at the free fermion point is equivalent to a @xmath4 cft .",
    "the central charge can not change continuously on the critical line in the neighbourhood of the free fermion model , therefore cft s corresponding to the self - avoiding loop model with variable bending rigidity should all be expected to exhibit @xmath160 .",
    "this of course entails that the strong coupling schwinger model at criticality should be equivalent to a @xmath160 cft .",
    "consequently , in accordance with zamolodchikov s c - theorem @xcite , @xcite , @xmath161 is related to a flow from the 6-vertex model ( @xmath128 ) having @xmath162 @xcite , @xcite towards a model with @xmath160 ( as discussed in general terms by salmhofer @xcite ) .",
    "+ we are going to test the above insight now by calculating the central charge for the strong coupling schwinger model .",
    "this can be done most easily by considering the model on a strip of width @xmath163 and length @xmath164 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the central charge is related to the partition function ( on a torus ) by the formula ( @xmath59 is the ( bulk ) free energy density on the infinite plane )    0.em    @xmath165\\over b}&= & af(z_{cr},1/2)\\ + \\ c\\",

    "the exact partition functions available on a @xmath166 torus @xcite , and on @xmath167 , @xmath168 tori @xcite are suited . in fig .",
    "6 we have plotted the function    @xmath169\\ -\\ ab\\ f(z,1/2)\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the @xmath167 , @xmath168 tori in dependence on @xmath19 ( @xmath170 has been inserted ) .",
    "@xmath171 has been calculated by means of the @xmath166 partition function . for sufficiently large @xmath172 the function @xmath173",
    "should be expected to approach the value of the central charge at the critical point .",
    "however , one has to be aware of the fact that on the very narrow ( with respect to @xmath163 ) tori considered massless and massive fields can contribute comparable amounts to the casimir energy .",
    "inasmuch as the central charge is calculated by means of eqs.([e1 ] ) , ( [ e2 ] ) from the casimir energy results obtained from very narrow tori may turn out misleading . in part , this is what we observe from fig .",
    "the result for the @xmath174 torus ( solid line ) rather suggests @xmath175 ( or some value close to it ) , however the torus is so narrow that massless and massive fields contribute comparably to the casimir energy .",
    "consequently , in agreement with our expectation @xmath4 for the wider @xmath176 torus ( dashed line ) we already observe a much smaller value of @xmath173 at the critical point .",
    "however , it turns out that the sizes of the tori for which the exact partition functions have been calculated so far in the literature are too small to allow any final conclusions for the central charge of the strong coupling schwinger model at criticality .",
    "only partition functions calculated on considerably larger lattices will allow to numerically test the prediction @xmath160 in a reliable way .",
    "+ 1.5em to conclude , the study of the self - avoiding loop model with variable bending rigidity presented in this article enhances the understanding of the critical behaviour of the strong coupling schwinger model with wilson fermions .",
    "we find that a second order phase transition which lies in the ising model universality class takes place at some finite value of the hopping parameter @xmath177 . using certain approximate analytic methods the value of the critical hopping parameter",
    "is confirmed to lie at @xmath3 in accordance with earlier numerical investigations @xcite , @xcite .",
    "certain arguments considered suggest that the strong coupling schwinger model at criticality is equivalent to a @xmath160 cft . + from a technical point of view , the present paper studies",
    "the application of the independent loop approximation to the qualitative and in part quantitative exploration of the phase structure of the self - avoiding loop model with variable bending rigidity in 2d .",
    "comparison with known numerical results @xcite shows that this method delivers a fairly correct picture for sufficiently low ( polymer ) loop densities .",
    "this is encouraging because the method is equally applicable to higher dimensions , while the analytic approach based on the exactly solvable free fermion model presented in section 4 is at least in part specific to 2d .",
    "this suggests that the independent loop approximation might successfully be applied also to analogous systems in higher dimensions ( e.g. , to strong coupling qcd in 4d where the critical hopping parameter has recently been studied by other methods @xcite ) .",
