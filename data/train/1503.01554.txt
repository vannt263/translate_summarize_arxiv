    "in the present paper we study interaction between fermions mediated by magnetic fluctuations in a vicinity of magnetic quantum critical point . to address this generic problem we consider a specific model of two holes injected into the bilayer antiferromagnet . the results presented below demonstrate that critical magnetic fluctuations lead to the long range coulomb - like attraction between the holes .",
    "our interest to this problem is motivated by cuprates .",
    "lying at the center of the debate of high-@xmath5 superconductivity is whether it originates from a fermi liquid or from a mott insulator .",
    "recent experimental data , including angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) support mott insulator scenario in underdoped cuprates and show transition from small to large fermi surface in the hole doping range @xmath6 , see refs .",
    "@xcite magnetic quantum oscillations ( mqo ) in underdoped yba@xmath7cu@xmath8o@xmath9 also support the small pocket scenario @xcite , in contrast to the large fermi surface observed on the overdoped side @xcite . besides that , existence of hole pockets is consistent with the picture of dilute holes dressed by spin fluctuations , based on doping a mott insulator .",
    "@xcite    optimally doped and overdoped cuprates do not have any static magnetic order . on the other hand ,",
    "the underdoped cuprates possess a static incommensurate magnetic order at zero temperature .",
    "a magnetic qcp separating these two regions was predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite at doping @xmath10 . in la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath13",
    "the qcp is smeared out because of disorder .",
    "however , in yba@xmath14cu@xmath15o@xmath9 the qcp is located experimentally with neutron scattering , nuclear magnetic resonance wipeout and muon spin rotation ( @xmath16 ) at doping @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "@xcite at larger doping , after crossing the qcp the ( quasi- ) static magnetic ordering vanishes and becomes fully dynamic .",
    "it is widely believed that superconducting pairing in cuprates is driven by a magnetic mechanism .",
    "the most common approach is based on the spin - fermion model in the frame of normal fermi liquid picture ( large fermi surface ) . within this",
    "approach electrons interact via exchange of an antiferromagnetic ( af ) fluctuation ( paramagnon ) .",
    "@xcite the lightly doped af mott insulator approach , instead , necessarily implies small fermi surface . in this case holes interact / pair via exchange of the goldstone magnon .",
    "@xcite due to the strong on - site hubbard repulsion both approaches result in the d - wave pairing of fermions .",
    "magnetic criticality can significantly influence superconducting pairing .",
    "this idea has been recently considered by wang and chubukov  @xcite in a context of electron doped cuprates .",
    "there are also some earlier works referenced in ref .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge all the previous works imply a normal liquid with large fermi surface .",
    "this might be a reconstructed fermi surface which emulates small hole pockets  @xcite , but still in essence this is a weak coupling normal fermi liquid like approach . a large fermi surface to a significant extent diminishes importance of the magnetic criticality for the pairing .    in this work",
    "we consider two holes injected in the 2d `` rigid '' mott insulator , so in essence our approach implies the small fermi surface and therefore strong coupling limit . in this case influence of the magnetic criticality on the coupling between two fermions",
    "is the most dramatic . as the mott insulator host we use the bilayer antiferromagnet with magnetic fluctuations driven by the interlayer coupling .",
    "we consider the bilayer model for the sake of performing a controlled calculation .",
    "however , we believe that conceptually our conclusions are equally applicable to the single - layer and multi - layer cuprates . the model presented here has only commensurate magnetic ordering , so we put aside incommensurability in the cuprates .",
    "the model under consideration demonstrates spin - charge separation at the qcp . @xcite",
    "it means delocalization of hole spin due to dressing by divergent magnon cloud .",
    "the effect of spin - charge separation points out to the nontriviality of the pairing problem .",
    "we are not familiar with any models that consider pairing of two fermions , that incorporate physics of spin - charge separation .    in order to probe the interaction between two fermions we consider spin fluctuations in the system , keeping the fermions to be immobile and spatially localized , just as magnetic impurities .",
    "@xcite because of the immobility , fermi statistics of the impurities is not actually relevant for our results , however for shortness we will call the impurities as `` fermions '' hereafter .",
    "our calculations show that the single magnon exchange is getting irrelevant close to the qcp .",
    "instead , we obtain strong inter - fermion attraction in singlet and triplet spin channel due to casimir effect .",
    "@xcite each of injected fermions ( holes ) builds up a `` bag '' of the quantum magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the fermions attract to each other , sharing common bag and reducing energy of the magnetic fluctuations inside of the bag .",
    "so - called `` spin - bag '' mechanism of attraction in the context of high-@xmath5 superconductivity in cuprates is familiar from the works of j. schrieffer _",
    "@xcite , that however did not account for the magnetic criticality , neither small fermi surface .",
    "the spin bag model has also conceptual similarity to qcd bag models for nucleon binding such as mit @xcite and chiral bags @xcite that have being extensively studied from 1970 s up to now .",
    "the structure of the paper is following . in the section [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce bilayer @xmath19 antiferromagnet , which is simple but instructive model and contains all essential physics of magnetic criticality . in the section [ sec : magnons_qcp ]",
    "we characterize magnetic quantum critical point driven by interlayer coupling @xmath20 and describe magnon excitations for undoped af in disordered phase in the frame of spin - bond mean field theory .",
    "next , in the section [ sec : hole - magnon_interaction ] we move to the hole - doped @xmath19 model and show how holes interact with magnons . in the section [ sec : hole - hole_interaction_mediated_by magnons ] , which is the main content of the paper , we consider hole - hole pairing problem at the qcp and show that pairing can not be described in terms of one - magnon exchange . in section [ sec :",
    "effective_theory_for casimir - like_interaction ] we develop effective theory for casimir interaction of the fermions , considering double - fermion `` atom '' which can be either in singlet or triplet state . in section [ sec : solution_to_dyson equation ] we present results of solution to dyson s equations for singlet and triplet green s functions and finally show how binding energy in both spin channels depends on inter - fermion distance @xmath4 .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions in the section [ sec : conclusions ] and provide supplementary material in the appendix .",
    "our model system is @xmath19 square lattice bilayer heisenberg antiferromagnet at zero temperature , where magnetic fluctuations are driven by interlayer coupling @xmath21 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : bilayer_af ] ) .     antiferromagnet model .",
    "two black dotes on the top layer represent holes.[fig : bilayer_af ] ]    the hamiltonian of the undoped host af reads @xmath22 the superscripts ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) in eq .",

    "the hamiltonian describes the antiferromagnetic coupling in the each layer as well as between the two layers .",
    "it is known that without holes ( half - filling ) the model has an @xmath29 magnetic qcp at @xmath30 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) separating the af ordered and the magnetically disordered phase of spin dimers . note that since we consider zero temperature case , the magnetic ordering in the af phase is consistent with the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "we dope the first layer with two holes .",
    "for simplicity we set hopping integrals equal to zero , therefore the holes are immobile .",
    "the holes interact with each other via magnetic fluctuations of the spins , i.e. exchanging by magnons .    in the subsections",
    "a and b of the current section we will briefly present formalism , which describes magnon excitations and hole - magnon interaction on the basis of the bilayer model . for more detailed explanations see @xcite ; a reader which is not interested in these technical details can go directly to the section [ sec : hole - hole_interaction_mediated_by magnons ] .",
    "magnetic excitations in the magnetically disordered phase are magnons , which are also in literature called triplons . in the present paper",
    "we will use terms magnons and triplons as synonyms . to describe the magnons we employ the spin - bond operator mean field technique .",
    "this approach has been previously applied to quantum disordered systems such as bilayer antiferromagnets , spin chains , spin ladders , kondo insulators etc.@xcite .",
    "it is known  @xcite that this simple technique gives the position of the qcp at @xmath31 , which is close to the exact value @xmath32 known from quantum monte carlo calculations @xcite , series expansions @xcite , and involved analytical calculations with the use of the brueckner technique @xcite .",
    "the spin - bond technique being much simpler than the brueckner technique has sufficient accuracy for our purposes .",
    "the bond - operator representation describes the system in a base of pairs of coupled spins on a rung , which can either be in a singlet or triplet ( triplon ) state .",
    "so , we define singlet @xmath33 and triplet @xmath34 operators that create a state at site @xmath25 with spin zero and spin one , which is polarized along one of the axises @xmath35 .",
    "the four types of bosons obey the bosonic commutation relations . to restrict the physical states to either singlet or triplet , the above operators are subjected to the constraint    @xmath36    in terms of these bosons ,",
    "the spin operators in each layer @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be expressed as    @xmath39    see ref .",
    "@xcite . substituting the bond - operator representation of spins defined in eq . into the @xmath40 in eq .",
    "we obtain    @xmath41    the hamiltonian ( [ eq : bondoperatorhamiltonian ] ) contains quadratic , cubic and quartic terms in magnon operators @xmath42 .",
    "the most important for us are the quadratic terms , because they provide quantum criticality . the only effect due to the nonlinear terms @xmath43 and",
    "@xmath44 is renormalization of parameters near the qcp , such as position of the qcp , magnon velocity , magnon gap and etc .",
    "this does not affect physics at the qcp , and therefore we will neglect these terms in further considerations .",
    "the next step for treating the hamiltonian ( [ eq : bondoperatorhamiltonian ] ) is to account for the hard - core constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) .",
    "it could be done by introducing infinite on - site repulsion of triplons ; however , this technique is quite involved .",
    "another , more simple , way is to employ mean - field approach , accounting for the constraint ( [ eq : constraint ] ) via a lagrange multiplier @xmath45 in the hamiltonian @xmath46 further analysis is straightforward .",
    "we replace singlet operators by numbers , @xmath47 ( bose - einstein condensation of spin singlets ) ; and diagonalize the quadratic in @xmath42 hamiltonian by performing the usual fourier and bogoliubov transformations    @xmath48    here @xmath49 is the number of spin dimers in the lattice ; the diagonalized hamiltonian reads @xmath50 where @xmath51 and coefficients @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",

    "we see that even at the qcp @xmath64 is close to unity , which again justifies smallness of the nonlinear terms @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the hamiltonian .",
    "the dispersion of magnons is @xmath65 in the vicinity of the wave - vector @xmath66 , here @xmath67 is the magnon gap and @xmath68 is the velocity of magnons @xmath69 , where the more precise value is @xmath70 , see ref .",
    "@xcite . in the af ordered phase",
    "the magnons are goldstone bosons and thus necessarily gapless . on the contrary , in the disordered phase",
    "the gap opens up and the spin - bond approach gives @xmath71 which is not far from the prediction for @xmath72 universality class systems @xmath73 with critical index @xmath74 ( see ref .",
    "so , the spin - bond method provides a reasonably accurate description of the qcp .",
    "we dope our system with two immobile holes , by removing two electrons from the upper plane of the bilayer antiferromagnet .",
    "hence we define the hole creation operator @xmath75 with spin projection @xmath76 by its action on the spin singlet bond @xmath77    @xmath78    where @xmath79 is vacuum .",

    "@xcite the spin of the hole is distributed in the power - law divergent cloud of magnons and in this sense is separated from the charge of the hole , localized on the hole s site . later in the paper we will show that the infrared divergence of the fermion - magnon coupling at the qcp results in strong power - law attraction between the fermions .",
    "importance of spin - charge separation for single - fermion problem at the qcp could be seen from analysis of analytical structure of the hole green s function .",
