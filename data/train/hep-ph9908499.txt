    "in order to look for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , low energy experiments can play an important role . various flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes in @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson decays and the muon anomalous magnetic moment could receive large contributions from loop diagrams of new particles .",
    "on - going experiments at kek and slac @xmath0-factories and the muon storage ring at bnl as well as future plans of @xmath0 and @xmath1 meson decay experiments therefore may be able to reveal physics beyond the energy scale which is currently accessible from direct particle search experiments .",
    "there have been extensive studies on fcnc effects in the supergravity model . in a supersymmetry ( susy ) model , the susy particles can give large contributions to various fcnc processes such as @xmath14@xcite , @xmath2@xmath3  and @xmath4@xmath5  mixings , @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "these contributions depend on the flavor mixing in the squark mass matrix which is _ a priori _ independent of the flavor mixing in the quark sector .",
    "in fact , fcnc processes can put strong constraints on these mixing parameters because arbitrary mixing parameters tend to give too large effects on , for instance , the @xmath4@xmath5  mixing amplitude if the susy particles exist below 1 tev . in the minimal supergravity model ,",
    "these dangerous fcncs are eliminated by the assumption that all squarks have universal susy breaking mass terms through the flavor - blind coupling of gravity interaction . in the previous publication @xcite",
    "we have investigated the @xmath2@xmath3mixing , the cp violating parameter of @xmath4@xmath5  mixing , @xmath6 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the model based on supergravity taking @xmath14  as one of phenomenological constraints .",
    "susy effects can increase the @xmath2@xmath3  mixing amplitude and @xmath6  by up to 20% in the minimal supergravity model .",
    "if we relax the strict universality of all scalar susy breaking masses at the gut scale so that we take the soft susy breaking scalar masses for the higgs fields different from that for squarks and sleptons , the maximal deviation becomes about 40% .",
    "the branching ratios for @xmath19  and @xmath20  can be suppressed by up to 10% compared to the sm predictions for the relaxed initial conditions while the deviation becomes only a few % in the minimal supergravity case .    in this paper , we perform quantitative study of fcnc processes in the supergravity model taking account of updated constraints on susy parameter space . among recent improvements on susy searches ,",
    "the susy higgs boson search in the lep  ii experiment turns out to give the most significant effect on constraining the susy parameter space .",
    "we show that possible deviation of the @xmath2@xmath3  mixing amplitude from the sm prediction becomes significantly reduced by the new constraint imposed by the higgs boson search , especially for a low @xmath7  region . taking into account the recent result of the higgs boson search ,",
    "the maximal deviation of the @xmath2@xmath3  mixing from the sm prediction is 12% in the minimal case and 25% in the nonminimal case for @xmath21 . if lep  ii does not find the lightest cp - even higgs boson below 105 gev , the deviation becomes 11% and 16% , respectively .",
    "we also consider the muon anomalous magnetic moment in the supergravity model .",
    "there have been many works on the muon anomalous magnetic moment in the mssm @xcite and in the supergravity model @xcite .",
    "it is known that this process gives a sizable deviation from the sm for large @xmath7 . at present , a possible new physics contribution to @xmath22 is estimated as @xmath23 @xcite . for the present higgs mass bound , we find that the susy contribution to @xmath22 can be @xmath24  @xmath25 for @xmath26 and therefore the muon anomalous magnetic moment becomes a useful constraint on the susy parameters when the on - going experiment improves the sensitivity by a factor of 1020 .",

    "previously in refs .",
    "@xcite the condition [ item : higgs ] did not give any impact to constrain the susy parameter space .",
    "due to the recent improvement of the higgs boson search at lep  ii @xcite , a sizable parameter space starts to be excluded .",
    "this will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "it is well known that there is a strict upper bound on the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass in the mssm @xcite . because the higgs search in the lep  ii experiment has reached to the sensitivity of 100 gev for the sm higgs boson and about 90 gev for the case of the lightest cp - even higgs boson in the mssm , a meaningful amount of the susy parameter space",
    "is already excluded @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector in the mssm consists of five physical mass eigenstates : two cp - even higgs boson @xmath66 and @xmath67 , one cp - odd higgs boson @xmath68 and a pair of charged higgs boson @xmath69 .",
    "there are two angles to specify the mixing in the higgs sector , namely , a ratio of two vacuum expectation values @xmath70 and the mixing angle @xmath71 for the two cp - even higgs bosons defined as @xmath72 where we have only kept the cp - even components of two higgs fields . in the mssm ,",
    "these masses and mixings are determined by two input parameters , for instance @xmath73 and @xmath74 , as well as stop and sbottom masses and mixing parameters through one - loop corrections to the higgs potential formula . in the supergravity model these masses and mixings at the electroweak scale are calculated by solving the rges from the initial conditions at the gut scale .",
    "the constraints on the susy parameter space from the lep experiments are expressed as an allowed region of two dimensional parameters , for instance @xmath75 , with different assumptions of the remaining parameters ( stop mass , _ etc . _ ) . in order to simplify the treatment in the numerical analysis we use the following procedure .",
    "we first take the experimental constraint in the space of @xmath73 and @xmath74 from ref .",
    "we require that the set of @xmath73 and @xmath74 calculated in the supergravity model is within the allowed region of this parameter space .",
    "strictly speaking , the allowed region slightly depends on the stop mass and mixing parameters through the angles @xmath71 and @xmath76 , but this dependence is not significant .",
    "in addition , except for a small parameter region in the case of a large @xmath7 , the cp - odd scalar mass becomes much larger than @xmath77 so that the property of the lightest cp - even higgs boson becomes very close to that of the sm higgs boson .",
    "in such a case the susy higgs boson search essentially gives the same lower bound of the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass as that of the sm higgs boson , and therefore almost independent of other susy parameters .    in the numerical calculation we use the analytic formula for the cp - even higgs mass matrix given in ref .",
    "this formula takes into account two - loop leading - log corrections and reproduces the next - to - leading - log results within a few gev for @xmath78 tev . as the present experimental constraint we require that the set of @xmath73 and @xmath74 is within the allowed region shown in fig .",
