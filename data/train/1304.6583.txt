    "a number of experiments using vertical organic spin valves ( osvs ) have been demonstrated over the past years , for example refs . [ ] . in many cases",
    "it is still unclear whether a tunneling based magnetoresistance effect ( tmr / tamr)@xcite or actual spin injection and consequently giant magnetoresistance ( gmr)@xcite is the origin of the observed effects . although the investigation of i / v - characteristics or the temperature dependence of the device resistance can give indications about the underlying transport mechanisms , final proof is still missing .",
    "further complications arise from the facts that charge injection into organic semiconductors is often based on tunneling@xcite and that intermixing of spin dependent transport and tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance@xcite can prevent a clear distinction between tmr and gmr .    in the advent of electrical spin injection into inorganic semiconductors a similar problem existed . especially in high mobility semiconductors stray magnetic fields originating from magnetic contacts can modulate intrinsic magnetoresistance effects and thus mimic the signature of spin injection . for electrically detected spin injection in inorganic semiconductors",
    "the final litmus test was the investigation of hanle precession in perpendicular magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "it can easily be shown that the principle of hanle precession @xcite is also applicable for organic spin valves , though with a slightly different result .",
    "the hanle effect itself is based on the precession of spins with the larmor frequency @xmath0 induced by a magnetic field @xmath1 which is oriented perpendicular to the spin :    @xmath2    @xmath3 is the electron rest mass , @xmath4 the electron s @xmath4-factor .",
    "thus the spin @xmath5 ( phase @xmath6 at time @xmath7 ) becomes time - dependent and can be described by :    @xmath8    usually spin polarized transport in organic or inorganic semiconductors is demonstrated in devices consisting of a non - magnetic transport layer placed between at least two ferromagnetic electrodes in a lateral or vertical arrangement , so called spin valve devices .",
    "the resistance @xmath9 of a spin valve device depends on the relative magnetization of the electrodes ( antiparallel @xmath10/parallel @xmath11 ) .",
    "provided that the electrodes exhibit different coercive fields , @xmath9 therefore can be adjusted by a magnetic field @xmath12 which is applied in the sample plane .",
    "+ if in a spin valve device spins actually are injected into the non - magnetic spacer layer the hanle effect can cause a change of the measured signal ( device resistance / current ) . the spins",
    "then precess in a magnetic field @xmath13 applied perpendicular to the sample plane while the in - plane field @xmath12 is kept constant at zero .",
    "this precession changes the relative orientation of the spins with respect to the magnetization of the electrodes .",
    "this change of the spins direction has the same consequences as a change of the electrodes magnetization and therefore can be detected in the measured signal .",
    "+ the results that can be obtained in a specific experiment investigating the presence of the hanle effect may be varying depending on the transport characteristics of the material under investigation",
    ". however the hanle effect always appears as spin - dephasing if rather large magnetic fields @xmath13 are applied . when @xmath13 , which causes the spin precession , is increased @xmath0 also gets larger , i.e. the precession gets faster .",
    "if @xmath0 is sufficiently high the single spins perform several full precessions during their transit through the layer under investigation . as the time @xmath14 which is needed for",
    "the transit through this layer can not be the same for every single spin in the material the spin - polarization of the total current averages out due to the precession .",
    "this loss of spin - polarization usually is called spin - dephasing@xcite . in materials in which the spin transport occurs rather incoherently ,",
    "i.e. the variation in @xmath14 is large , spin - dephasing can already be observed at small @xmath13 resulting in a simple quenching of the magnetoresistance .",
    "in contrast , if coherent spin transport is present large @xmath13 must be applied in order to observe the decrease in magnetoresistance while the coherent precession is observed as so called hanle oscillations@xcite of the resistance .",
    "[ fighanleex ] shows resistance traces that can be expected for measurements in perpendicular magnetic fields in a spin valve device in which the hanle effect is present and incoherent transport is dominating . to initialize this kind of measurement ,",
    "it is necessary to prepare the parallel ( antiparallel ) state resulting in a device resistance of @xmath11 ( @xmath10 ) at @xmath15 before the sweep of @xmath13 is started . for a spin valve for which @xmath16 as is typical for organic spin valves increasing @xmath13 results in a decrease of @xmath11 and in an increase of @xmath10 .",
    "both curves end up at the same intermediate resistance @xmath17 at sufficiently large @xmath13 . + it should be noted here that the observation of the hanle effect is the most robust proof for electrical spin injection and detection .",
    "other methods to demonstrate the injection of spin polarized carriers like faraday rotation in inorganic semiconductors@xcite or muon spin rotation@xcite or two photon photoemission @xcite in organic semiconductors ( oscs ) can be used as a proof for spin injection , however , they can not check whether an electrically detected spin valve signal originates from spin polarized carrier transport or from side effects .",
    "only the hanle effect provides the necessary proof that the signal truly originates from the electrical detection of spin polarized carriers .",
    "thus the investigation of the hanle effect by magnetoresistance measurements ( mr ) in perpendicular magnetic fields ( also named perpendicular geometry hereafter ) is an indispensable tool to interpret and understand the results of any spin valve experiment .",
    "+ so far , most of the experiments in which hanle effect and electrical spin injection is observed are reported for lateral spin valve devices with inorganic spacers ( si , gaas , graphene ) .",
    "our experiments comprise magnetoresistance measurements in perpendicular magnetic fields on a number of osv devices with a layer of an osc as the spin transporting material sandwiched between two ferromagnetic electrodes where the bottom electrode consists of @xmath18 ( lsmo ) and the top electrode is a ferromagnetic metal .",
    "the vertical arrangement of the devices functional layers as well as the choice of lsmo and co or co alloys as electrode materials is common to nearly all osvs reported so far .",
    "+ in the discussion about the hanle effect in vertical spin valves two arguments are often brought forward in order to explain the possible absence of spin precession : firstly @xmath13 might be shielded by the ferromagnetic electrodes layers in the vertical geometry thus impeding the spin precession by reducing @xmath13 to zero .",
    "secondly the thickness of the osc layer is usually small compared to the length of a spin - conducting channel in lateral spin valve devices . as a consequence",
    "the spin transfer from one electrode to the other ( e.g. represented by the transit time @xmath14 ) might occur on a timescale much shorter than the precession time of the spins if a perpendicular field in the @xmath19 regime is applied .",
    "+ we can , however , rule out these unwanted effects in our devices for two reasons .",
    "first the high in - plane shape anisotropy of ferromagnetic thin films resulting from their large volume magnetization ( @xmath20 for lsmo@xcite , @xmath21 for co @xcite and @xmath22 for cofe@xcite ) has to be taken into account . due to this shape",
    "anisotropy the magnetization remains completely in - plane , even for small perpendicular fields , preventing any shielding of @xmath13 .",
    "+ for the transit time the following estimation shows that indeed only rather small @xmath13 are needed for a sufficiently fast precession of the spins .",
    "assuming @xmath23 for any osc the precession time @xmath24 can be calculated from equ .",
    "[ eqlarmor ]    @xmath25    this yields @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath24 has to be compared to the transit time which is needed for a spin to travel through the osc layer with a thickness @xmath28 .",
    "we make a rough estimation for @xmath14 as well :    @xmath29    @xmath30 is the velocity of the spins , @xmath31 the electric field .",
    "typical values for an osv experiment are : mobility @xmath32 , @xmath33 and applied bias voltage @xmath34 . with these values",
    "we obtain @xmath35 from equ .",
    "[ eqtrans ] .",
    "thus even for thin osc layers the precession at small @xmath13 is sufficiently fast compared to the transit time to cause a spin - dephasing effect . at the same time",
    "the perpendicular field itself is far too weak to be shielded by the ferromagnetic electrodes .",
    "it should be noted that the mobility used for the calculation is an upper estimate and the mobilities that we expect to obtain in the experiment are considerably lower .",
    "+ furthermore we conclude from the comparison of @xmath24 and @xmath14 that the transport through the osc layer is so slow that we do not expect to see any hanle oscillations but only the hanle effect caused by the spin - dephasing ( see fig . [ fighanleex ] ) .",
    "this conclusion is additionally sustained by the fact that the charge transport in amorphous or polycrystalline osc layers is occurring by rather incoherent mechanisms like variable range hopping @xcite or multiple trapping and release@xcite .",
    "+ although no hanle effect as such has been observed in organic semiconductors , the demonstration of spin precession of conduction electrons in osc by paramagnetic resonance @xcite clearly shows that it the underlying physics is the same for organic and inorganic semiconductors .",
    "we have fabricated two sets of vertical spin valve structures with different osc materials as spacer layer which are also different concerning the electrodes and the fabrication process .",
    "+ the first material under investigation is the _",
    "n_-type osc _",
    "n , n_-bis(n - heptafluorobutyl)-3,4:9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic diimide [ ptcdi - c4f7 , fig .",
    "[ figmr](b ) ] which is used due to its excellent properties with respect to charge carrier mobility and stability in ambient conditions@xcite .",
    "ptcdi - c4f7 is a material well suited for spin valve applications as already has been shown in our previous work@xcite .",
    "the devices based on this material have a bottom contact made of @xmath36 thick lsmo layers , grown by pulsed plasma deposition@xcite on strontium titanate ( sto ) or neodymium gallate ( ngo ) substrates , and a cofe top contact .",
    "a series of devices with different osc layer thicknesses @xmath28 ranging from @xmath37 to @xmath38 was fabricated .",
    "+ for device fabrication with ptcdi - c4f7 as osc spacer , first ti / au metal stripes are deposited on the lsmo , using optical lithography , evaporation , and lift - off .",
    "these stripes serve as alignment marks and later as bondpads . a rectangular bottom contact",
    "is then patterned into the lsmo layer by optical lithography and dry etching , leaving the metal contact at one side of the rectangle .",
    "subsequently , the sample is inserted into the uhv - deposition chamber where a bake - out procedure is performed at 450 @xmath39c for 1 hour at an oxygen pressure of 10@xmath40 mbar , in order to compensate under - oxygenation which may occur during the processing .",
    "subsequently , the ptcdi - c4f7 layer and the metal top electrode are deposited under different angles of incidence through a shadow mask with a rectangular opening . after removing the sample from the uhv chamber ,",
    "ti / au stripes are deposited through a second shadow mask with striped windows .",
    "these metal stripes are later used as bond pads for the top contacts and also serve as an etch mask for the removal of the top electrode material between the stripes by dry etching .",
    "this approach provides clean , oxygen - free , and reproducible interfaces which are known to be crucial for working osv devices .",
    "+ furthermore we also fabricated devices with the well known and extensively investigated material tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)- aluminium(iii ) [ alq@xmath41 , fig . [ figmr](a ) ] , a low mobility amorphous _ n_-type osc .",
    "the fabrication process for these devices is different from the one for the ptcdi - c4f7 devices and will be explained in detail elsewhere .",
    "the main differences compared to the ptcdi - c4f7 devices are the fabrication method of the lsmo electrode ( thickness @xmath42 , grown by pulsed laser deposition ) and the patterning of the devices active area by means of lithography instead of shadow masks and dry etching .",
    "the thickness of the osc layer is ranging from @xmath43 to @xmath37 for the alq@xmath41 devices .",
    "+ the samples are characterized at various temperatures between @xmath44 and room temperature .",
    "preliminary investigations of the observed mr effects were done in either in a @xmath45he flow cryostate or a @xmath45he bath cryostate , both equipped with an external room temperature electromagnet ( @xmath46 respectively @xmath47 ) at various temperatures .",
    "the experiments in the perpendicular geometry were conducted at @xmath44 in a @xmath45he bath cryostate with a 3d vector magnet in which magnetic fields up to @xmath48 can be applied in any direction in space .",
    "fig . [ figmr ] shows typical magnetoresistance traces for both types of devices .",
    "the magnetoresistance trace of an alq@xmath41 based device ( present device : @xmath49 ) is shown in fig . [ figmr](a ) .",
    "the actual spin valve signal is very pronounced and almost no background effect is observed , only a small decrease of @xmath9 with increasing @xmath12 can be discerned .",
    "the spin valve effect itself is negative ( low resistance state appears for parallel magnetization of the electrodes @xmath10 ) .",
    "the change of the magnetization can be identified as sharp switching events in the mr trace .",
    "when @xmath12 is swept from high positive to high negative fields the first switching event leading to the low resistance state @xmath10 appears at small negative fields ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "this switching can be ascribed to the magnetization reversal of the lsmo electrode .",
    "the co electrode s magnetization is reversed at higher fields ( @xmath51 ) via multiple steps finally resulting in the high resistance parallel magnetization state @xmath11 again .",
    "the mr effect has a magnitude of mr@xmath52 at @xmath44 and @xmath53 and is symmetric with respect to @xmath54 , i.e. for the opposite sweep direction the same behavior is observed in the positive field range , .",
    "+ the magnetoresistance trace of a ptcdi - c4f7 based device ( present device : @xmath55 ) has a different shape [ fig . [ figmr](b ) ] .",
    "the observed effect with a total mr ratio of @xmath56 at @xmath44 and @xmath57 again is symmetric with respect to @xmath54 but has two distinct components . on one hand",
    "the mr trace comprises a non - linear background effect , increasing resistance with increasing @xmath12 , which is well known for various osv devices based on other oscs reported in the literature@xcite and can be explained by the magnetic electrodes being saturated at higher magnetic fields .",
    "the organic magnetoresistance effect@xcite ( omar ) can be excluded very likely as origin for the background signal in our devices as has been shown in previous studies@xcite . on the other hand",
    "we see the actual negative spin valve effect which is less pronounced compared to the alq@xmath41 osv due to the superimposed background signal .",
    "comparable to the alq@xmath41 device the first switching event from high ( @xmath11 ) to low resistance ( @xmath10 ) occurs at small @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath12 is further increased the magnetization reversal of the second electrode ( cofe ) occurs at @xmath58 which is lower than the magnetic field required to reverse the magnetization of the co electrode in the alq@xmath41 devices .",
    "+ the spin valve signals presented in fig .",
    "[ figmr ] have been studied extensively with respect to various parameters ( temperature , @xmath59 , @xmath28 ) , which will be presented elsewhere .",
    "nevertheless , these experiments did not yield reliable proof for the underlying transport mechanisms of the observed spin valve effects . as already mentioned above more information",
    "can be gained by measurements in perpendicular magnetic fields .",
    "+      in order to detect the presence of hanle precession it is necessary to apply the perpendicular magnetic field to the in - plane antiparallel magnetized and the in - plane parallel magnetized states of the spin valve , respectively .",
    "the fact that osv often exhibit a negative spin valve effect shows that sign and magnitude of the spin accumulation in the organic semiconductor can not be related to the magnetization states in a straightforward manner . + as a consequence it is not possible to predict whether the influence of spin precession on the two individual resistance states is equally strong .",
    "it is however obvious that the difference in resistance between the two states should diminish when hanle precession is present .",
    "thus it is important to investigate both remanent states in detail . in a recent publication@xcite",
    ", data has already been presented for magnetic field sweeps perpendicular to the sample plane , however , starting the sweep from perpendicular saturation . in our case",
    "the use of a 3d vector magnet allows us to prepare both remanent states individually by running a field sweep from parallel saturation to the desired state and then reducing the in - plane field to zero .",
    "subsequently the perpendicular field is applied and swept over the desired range .",
