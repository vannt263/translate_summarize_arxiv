    "in the past two decades , we have witnessed a tremendous improvement in the energy and momentum resolution of angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) , which is one of the most powerful experimental tools for investigating strongly correlated materials . in particular ,",
    "recent arpes spectra of high - t@xmath0 cuprates@xcite , alkali - doped fullerides@xcite , and manganites@xcite , have shown that the interplay of electron - electron ( e - e ) and electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interactions have an important role in the qualitative and quantitative understanding of the experiments . when considering systems of low dimensionality , the situation is even more complicated . in one dimension ( 1d )",
    ", the low - energy states separate into spin ( spinon ) and charge ( holon ) excitations that move with different velocities and are at different energy scales @xcite .",
    "spin - charge separation ( scs ) has been observed experimentally in semiconductor quantum wires@xcite , organic conductors@xcite , carbon nanotubes@xcite , and atomic chains on semiconductor surfaces@xcite .",
    "it has also been predicted that scs can be achieved in optical lattices of ultracold atoms@xcite .",
    "the phenomenon has been observed in photoemission experiments on quasi-1d cuprate @xmath1@xcite and on organic conductor ttf - tcnq@xcite .",
    "the coupling to the lattice is considered to be responsible for the unusual spectral broadening of the spin and charge peaks observed by arpes in these quasi-1d materials .",
    "recently , the interplay between spin , charge , and lattice degrees of freedom has also been investigated in the family of quasi-1d cuprates ca@xmath2y@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 , using high resolution resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs)@xcite .    in 1d systems and in the absence of e - ph interaction ,",
    "the spin excitations are described by a band whose curvature is proportional to the exchange energy scale @xmath6 , while the charge excitation dispersion width is comparable to the electronic hopping ( @xmath7 ) . moreover",
    ", the collective excitation spectrum of 1d systems presents spectral weight ( shadow bands ) at momenta larger than the fermi momentum @xmath8 due to their luttinger liquid nature .",
    "it is therefore of paramount importance to study the behavior of the photoemission spectrum of materials in which it is believed that a strong interaction with the lattice degrees of freedom is present . in particular , this aspect is not entirely understood and one expects that the interplay between e - e and e - ph interactions has a profound effect on scs and on the interpretation of the experiments .",
    "the basic lattice model used to describe e - e and e - ph interactions in 1d is given by the hubbard - holstein ( hh ) hamiltonian , which incorporates nearest - neighbor hopping , an on - site coulomb repulsion and a linear coupling between the charge density and the lattice deformation of a dispersionless phonon mode . within this model , the electronic spectral properties",
    "have been studied by ref . and , where the adiabatic limit ( phonon frequency smaller than the electronic hopping ) is mostly analyzed at half electronic filling in the regime of weak to intermediate e - ph coupling . in the first paper ,",
    "the authors use dynamical density matrix renormalization group ( d - dmrg ) and assess the robustness of scs against e - ph coupling , interpreting the spectral function as a superposition spectra of spinless fermions dressed by phonons . in particular , a peak - dip - hump structure is found , where the dip energy scale is given by the phonon frequency and originated from the charge - mediated coupling of phonons and spinons . in the second paper ,",
    "the authors use cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) and an optimized phonon approach observing that e - ph coupling mainly gives rise to a broadening of the holon band , due to the presence of many adiabatic phonons .",
    "in contrast to these previous studies , in this paper we consider the case of a finite hole doping ( or equivalently electronic density different from half - filling ) , a regime that could be currently accessible in the experiments@xcite .",
    "moreover , we systematically study the spectral properties as a function of the e - ph coupling and of the phonon frequency , focusing on the regime where phonon frequency is equal to the electronic half bandwidth @xmath9 ( larger than exchange energy @xmath6 ) . in order to address this problem",
    ", we numerically calculate the spectral function ( photoemission spectrum , pes ) of the hh model in 1d using the time - dependent dmrg@xcite ( tdmrg ) .",
    "the tdmrg is a robust and unbiased numerical technique for studying the dynamics of 1d quantum lattice models , that we apply in the presence of phononic degrees of freedom .",
    "we consider the regime in which a very large coulomb repulsion is present in order to avoid competition with other phases such as the cdw peierls state@xcite and to analyze the effects of a small exchange energy @xmath6 .",
    "one of the main observations is that the e - ph interaction induces a reduction of the spinon and the holon band amplitudes , from weak up to intermediate e - ph coupling . in this case",
    "phonons are mainly coupled to the charge degrees of freedom while the spinon is pretty much unaffected within good approximation .",
    "eventually , in the strong e - ph coupling regime , one observes that the separation of spin and charge spectral peaks is not appreciable anymore being spinon and holon bands merged in one main band .",
    "moreover , there is a transfer of spectral weight in side - bands separated from the main band by an energy difference approximately equal to the phonon frequency .",
    "therefore , for strong e - ph coupling , the system can be described as a polaronic liquid , with the spectral weight extended well beyond fermi momentum @xmath10 .    in order to interpret and understand these results , we develop a controlled analytical approach to obtain the spectral function . by construction , this approach is rigorously valid in the presence of an infinitely large coulomb repulsion , and a phonon frequency larger than the electronic hopping . in this regime , we approximate the ground state as a product of the ogata - shiba s wave - function@xcite resulting from the exact bethe ansatz solution of the @xmath11 hubbard model , and a noninteracting displaced phonon wave - function .",
    "this calculation provides a good qualitative and quantitative agreement with the tdmrg results in the weak and strong e - ph coupling regime . in this latter case ,",
    "the spectral side - bands at intervals of energy proportional to the phonon frequency are almost coincident within tdmrg and analytical approaches .",
    "finally , the pes is investigated with tdmrg decreasing the phonon frequency and exploring also the adiabatic limit . in this case , we reproduce the results of ref . finding the characteristic spectral peak - dip - hump structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii the hh model is briefly introduced ; in sec.iii the method employed to calculate the spectral function is presented . in sec.iv ,",
    "the numerical results obtained from the tdmrg are discussed and analyzed . in sec.v , an analytical method for calculating the spectral function , its validity , and comparison with the tdmrg results",
    "are discussed .",
    "we finally conclude discussing the implications of our results for the experiments .",
    "the hubbard - holstein model describes einstein phonons locally coupled to electrons described by the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "it can be written in the general form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hopping amplitude between nearest neighbor sites ( indicated by @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 is the on - site coulomb repulsion , @xmath16 is the phonon frequency , @xmath17 is the e - ph coupling constant , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) is the standard electron creation ( annihilation ) operator on site @xmath20 with spin @xmath21 ( @xmath22 indicates the opposite of @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 is the electronic occupation operator , and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the phonon creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "the planck constant is set to @xmath27 , the lattice parameter @xmath28 , and all of the energies are in the units of the hopping @xmath13 .",
    "it is well known that the hh model is extremely complicated and impossible to solve analytically .",
    "its phase diagram and ground - state static properties@xcite have been thoroughly studied in the literature , using different numerical techniques , including the dmrg@xcite .",
    "the main difficulty consists of handling the phononic degrees of freedom , that need to be described in principle by an infinite dimensional hilbert space at every lattice site .",
    "different truncation schemes for the phononic hilbert space have been proposed , including the possibility of using optimal phonon bases@xcite .",
    "still , solving the problem numerically remains remarkably time consuming , especially for the calculation of the dynamical properties such as the spectral function . in the next section , the pes of the 1d hh model",
    "is calculated using the tdmrg .",
    "the numerical results are then presented and compared with an analytical method we introduce in section v.",
    "in order to obtain dynamical properties of 1d quantum lattice models in the presence of phonons , several techniques such as dynamical dmrg@xcite and exact diagonalization combined with cluster perturbation theory have been used in the literature@xcite .",
    "in contrast to these approaches , here the pes is calculated using the tdmrg with krylov expansion of the time - evolution operator@xcite .",
    "the time evolution is computed using @xmath29 dmrg states and the bare phonon bases are truncated keeping up to 9 phonons per site . unless otherwise stated",
    ", a lattice with @xmath30 sites , @xmath31 electrons and open boundary conditions is considered . in order to calculate the pes",
    ", we measure the time dependent correlation function @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the ground - state of hamiltonian ( [ hh ] ) . @xmath33 and",
    "the ground - state energy are calculated using static dmrg .",
    "excited states @xmath34 and their time evolution @xmath35 are then calculated with the tdrmg . now ,",
    "since ground - state time evolute is trivial @xmath36 , we thus calculate eq.([pes ] ) simply as @xmath37 for @xmath38 .",
    "long time evolutions up to @xmath39 with time steps of @xmath40 are considered , and @xmath41 is obtained by a space - time fourier transform performed using a hann window function , giving a broadening of the spectral peaks approximately given by @xmath42 ( the details of the procedure are reported in ref . ) . here ,",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 are the momentum and energy of the electron .",
    "the properties of the pes are analyzed starting from ( @xmath45 ) and considering in particular @xmath46 . in this regime ,",
    "fig.[fig : pes_contour ] shows @xmath41 from weak e - ph coupling @xmath47 up to strong interaction @xmath48 .    in order to interpret the results in more detail , fig.[fig : cuts_omega2 ]",
    "is showing three vertical cuts at @xmath49 , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , and @xmath52 of the same spectrum .",
    "we note that the spectrum for @xmath47 is very similar to the @xmath53 pes ( not shown ) : it is very clear the presence of scs , where the spectral weight concentrated on the spinon and holon bands forming a triangular spectral structure between @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( fig.[fig : pes_contour ] ) .",
    "as expected for a luttinger liquid , the shadow bands extend beyond @xmath10 . a closer look at pes in fig.[fig : cuts_omega2 ] in this weak coupling regime , shows that for @xmath50 and @xmath49 phonon effects are negligible : one can observe clearly the higher spinon peak at the top of the spectrum ( at @xmath56 for @xmath57 ) , and a shifted holon peak .",
    "the e - ph effects are already present at this weak coupling for @xmath58 , where a shoulder on the left of the main peak correspondent to the shadow band is visible .    for @xmath59 ,",
    "phonon effects come already into play with very interesting features at all momenta .",
    "looking at fig.[fig : pes_contour ] , one can observe a reduction of the spinon and holon bandwidth , as the triangular spectral structure comprising the spinon and holon bands gets _",
    "squeezed_. an apparent suppression of the spectral weight or gap seems to appear at @xmath60 with the formation of a new band ranging from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , whose dispersion resembles those of the holon and shadow bands .",
    "the same characteristics are visible in fig.[fig : cuts_omega2 ] for @xmath49 , where the distance between the spinon peak and the holon peak is reduced and a side - band at the left of the holon peak is formed .",
    "this new spectral feature seems to originate from the holon band , while the height of the spinon peak is practically unchanged going from @xmath47 to @xmath59 .    at @xmath62 ,",
    "the progressive reduction of the electronic bandwidth ( both of the spinon and holon bands ) is even more evident , and the triangular spectral structure has almost collapsed . the new band formed at @xmath59 is now separated by a larger gap with respect to the main spectrum , while the spectral redistribution creates now a newer side - band whose width is smaller and ranging from @xmath61 to @xmath63 . as one can see , in fig.[fig : cuts_omega2 ] for @xmath49 , several side - bands separated in energy by a quantity proportional to @xmath64 are visible .",
    "the side - bands present no internal structure and suggest that , up to @xmath62 , they originate from the holon bands without contribution from the spinons .    for @xmath65 ,",
    "the original triangular feature in the pes is completely collapsed to a flat structure .",
    "also , if one looks at fig.[fig : cuts_omega2 ] for @xmath49 and @xmath57 for the same value of @xmath17 , the height of the first spectral peak is dramatically increased with respect to the case of @xmath62 .",
    "this indicates that one is entered in the strong e - ph coupling regime where the main band is followed by many side - bands coming from both holon _ and _ spinon bands .",
    "this description , as one can see in fig.[fig : pes_contour ] , is even more evident for @xmath66 , where the pes is broken in spectral lines whose weight decreases from the first structure to the followings and extends beyond the fermi momentum @xmath10 . besides , the separation between the holon and the spinon peak is not discernible anymore , suggesting that the system is going towards a state that can be described in terms of a spinless polaronic liquid where the spins are completely uncorrelated .",
    "indeed , for @xmath48 , the physics of phonon side - bands is dominating the pes , observing that the several spectral structures have a smaller width ( compared to @xmath66 results ) , bigger height , and that the first spectral structure has less weight than the second one .",
    "this is reproducing approximatively a transition to a gaussian distribution of the spectral weights typical of the polaronic regime .    in order to investigate",
    "further this behavior , we have studied the ground state density distribution function in momentum space @xmath67 and the spin - spin correlation function in real space , @xmath68 . as expected for correlated 1d systems , the density distribution function in momentum space shown in fig.[fig : nk ] presents a smooth decrease at the fermi momentum @xmath10 for all e - ph coupling values .",
    "we point out that the e - ph coupling reduces the decrease at @xmath10 and , globally , it broadens the density distribution function .",
    "eventually , for @xmath48 , one gets a gaussian profile with @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in panel(b ) of fig.[fig : nk ] , the spin - spin correlation function from the center of the chain is shown .",
    "up to @xmath66 , spin - spin correlations fast decay as a function of the distance from the center of the chain with approximately the same behavior . for @xmath48 , they decay even faster , showing evidence that , in the polaronic regime spin degrees of freedom are completely uncorrelated .    in order to get a better interpretation of the aforementioned results , in the next section an analytical approach for calculating the pes will be introduced , explaining the redistribution of the spectral weight in terms of phonon side - bands .    .",

    "the method consists of a variational canonical transformation originally proposed in ref .",

    "also , the optimized polaronic parameter @xmath83 ( see appendix [ appendix ] ) is describing the degree of polaron formation , that is the amount of spectral weight redistribution in phonon side - bands . in general",

    "the optimal shift is in total agreement with tdmrg results in the whole range of e - ph couplings .",
    "we can now briefly discuss the results described above making a contact with the experiments described in ref .. in this paper , the authors measure the rixs spectra of a family quasi 1d cuprates @xmath133 , an insulating system that can be doped over a wide range of hole concentrations .",
    "the experiment reveals a @xmath134 mev phonon ( energy larger than the typical transfer hopping @xmath13 along chains in quasi 1-d cuprates ) strongly coupled to the electronic state at different hole dopings .",
    "it is found that the spectral weight of phonon excitations in the rixs spectrum is directly dependent on the e - ph coupling strength and doping , producing multiple peaks in the spectrum with an energy separation corresponding to the energy of the quanta of the lattice vibrations , in a fashion similar to what we obtain in the present paper .",
    "we believe that , even in arpes spectra of these materials , phonon side - bands structures in the pes could be observable .",

    ", we observe a behavior different from that discussed in the previous section .",
    "for instance , at @xmath49 , a dip structure at the left side of the spinon peak is shifted by a quantity equal to @xmath135 , reproducing qualitatively the results discussed in ref .. in ref .",
    ", the interpretation of results starts from the consideration that , in absence of e - ph coupling , according to the bethe ansatz solution the pes is constructed by a superposition of a set of holon dispersions forming a cosine band with width @xmath136 .",
    "moreover , each holon dispersion is characterized by one spinon momentum . in the presence of e - ph interaction , due to spin - charge separation",
    "each holon couples with phonons independently and the pes is interpreted as a spectrum of spinless electron dressed by einstein phonons .",
    "this generates a split of the holon dispersion that is away from the top of the spectrum by a energy interval equal to @xmath16 , and a transfer of spectral weight to high energy giving a characteristic peak - dip - hump structure .",
    "our results are consistent with this picture , confirming that spin - charge separation is robust in this regime . actually , in contrast to what discussed in the previous section for @xmath46 , where polaronic effects dominate , when the phonon frequency is smaller than the hopping @xmath13 , the e - ph coupling effect gives rise to a dip in between the holon and spinon peak . moreover ,",
    "this spectral dip structure is furthermore shifted if @xmath64 is increased to @xmath137 ( see panel(b ) of fig.[fig : g1 ] for @xmath138 and @xmath49 ) . in this case , our data shows also a shoulder on the left side of the holon peak , in contrast to what found in ref .. in our calculation , this feature can be interpreted as the onset of phonon side - bands . increasing the phonon frequency to @xmath139 , several sidebands in the pes",
    "are found as discussed in the previous section .",
    "interestingly , at @xmath57 , instead of a dip , we find a peak separated from the spinon band by a energy distance equal to @xmath64 .",
    "eventually , at the fermi momentum and for larger frequencies , these features become part of the first and the higher side - bands .",
    "we have studied the spectral function of the 1d hh model using the tdmrg , in the limit of large coulomb repulsion , and away from electronic half - filling .",
    "the entire range of e - ph coupling , from weak to strong coupling @xmath17 , has been analyzed .",
    "our results indicate that , from weak to intermediate @xmath17 , scs is robust against e - ph coupling : the phonons couple mainly with charge degrees of freedom , leaving the spinon band almost unaffected . for sufficiently strong e - ph interaction ,",
    "the pes weight is redistributed in phonon side - bands , and the spinon and holon spectral features are not discernable anymore . in this regime , we support the numerical tdmrg results with an analytical variational calculation , approximating the wave - function as a convolution of charge , spin and phonon parts . in this case , a very good qualitative and quantitative agreement is obtained , and the system can be described as a polaronic liquid , with non - zero spectral weight at momenta larger than the fermi momentum .",

    "in this appendix we determine the variational parameters @xmath76 and @xmath77 appearing in the transformed hamiltonian eq.([trans_hh_1 ] ) of the main text .",
    "an effective electronic hamiltonian , @xmath140 , is used , which is obtained by averaging eq.([trans_hh_1 ] ) on the phononic vacuum of the transformed hilbert space , @xmath141 = \\langle o_{ph}|\\tilde{h}|o_{ph}\\rangle$ ] @xmath142=-t e^{-g^2 f^2 } \\sum\\limits_{<i , j > , \\sigma}(c^\\dagger_{i,\\sigma } c_{j,\\sigma } + h.c.)\\\\&&+ ( u-2 g^2 f^2 \\omega_0 ) \\sum\\limits_{i } n_{i,\\sigma } n_{i,\\bar{\\sigma } } + \\eta \\sum\\limits_i n_i   + l g^2 \\omega_0 \\delta^2 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter @xmath77 is simply obtained by using the hellmann - feynman theorem @xmath143 where @xmath98 is the total number of electrons , @xmath144 is the electronic density , and @xmath145 is the ground state of @xmath140 .",
    "now we are left only with the determination of the parameter @xmath76 , which will be found by solving the hamiltonian @xmath146=-t e^{-g^2 f^2 } \\sum\\limits_{<i , j > , \\sigma}(c^\\dagger_{i,\\sigma } c_{j,\\sigma } + h.c . ) \\\\ & & + ( u-2 g^2 f^2 \\omega_0 ) \\sum\\limits_{i } n_{i,\\sigma } n_{i,\\bar{\\sigma } } + g^2 \\omega_0 ( 1-f)^2 n^2/l + \\eta n , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by using the static dmrg and minimizing the ground - state energy of this new hamiltonian @xmath140 as a function of @xmath76 . for each set of values @xmath15 , @xmath13 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 ,",
    "considered in the original hamiltonian , we get an optimal polaronic parameter @xmath90 . in the panels ( a ) and ( b ) of fig.[fig : f_best_energy ] , the ground - state energy of @xmath147 $ ] as a function of @xmath76 for two different values of e - ph coupling @xmath148 and @xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath46 is shown .",
    "for @xmath149 the value of @xmath90 obtained is close to @xmath151 meaning that for these sets of parameters the system is near the polaronic regime , that ideally is expected to be reached for stronger e - ph coupling and phonon frequency . in panel ( c ) of fig.[fig : f_best_energy ] , the optimal polaronic parameter @xmath90 as a function of e - ph is shown as discussed in the main text ."
