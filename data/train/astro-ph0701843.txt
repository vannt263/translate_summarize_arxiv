    "the central molecular zone ( cmz ) of the galaxy , a region of radius @xmath2 pc , contains large amount of dense molecular gas ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ; e.g. , paglione et al . 1998 ) .",
    "it has also been observed that gas temperature is uniformly high in the cmz ( @xmath53060 k ; morris et al .",

    "the detection of @xmath9al @xmath10-ray line supports the occurrence of such energetic explosions ( von ballmoos , diehl , &  schonfelder 1987 ) . the widespread sio emission there has been understood as a result of large - scale shocks such as cloud - cloud collisions and/or fossil superbubbles ( martin - pintado et al .",

    "these suggest that the boisterous molecular gas kinematics in the cmz may be a result of violent release of kinetic energy by a number of supernova explosions .    to assess the effect of supernova explosions on the kinematics and physical conditions of the cmz , it is crucial to pick up supernova / molecular cloud interacting zone completely .",
