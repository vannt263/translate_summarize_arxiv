    "for example , in two or three dimensions where the energy levels can be highly degenerate , or in a homogeneous system where the energy spectrum is continuous , the chemical potential is far more likely to lie at , or very near to , an available energy level .",

    "the dashed horizontal line indicates the chemical potential @xmath124.,width=170 ]    to rephrase the argument , consider a group of @xmath181 states near the chemical potential that are on average half filled .",
    "in this case the states near the chemical potential are mutually coupled by the many - body pairing and the corresponding eigenstates can be assumed to be essentially symmetric in terms of the population of each single particle state .",
    "the probability of transferring the projectile particle , and a low - lying bound particle of opposite spin , to any of the half - filled levels is then amplified by a combinatorial factor increasing with @xmath182 , similar to the collective spontaneous emission ( dicke superradiance ) of light from a symmetrically excited atomic medium @xcite .",
    "the collective enhancement would be maximum at exactly half filling and the intermediate states populating @xmath102 and @xmath104 levels near @xmath124 would yield one strong resonance for every level @xmath103 , in agreement with the bcs mean - field prediction .",
    "additional resonances due to unpopulated @xmath102 and @xmath104 levels lying well above the chemical potential [ as in fig .",

    "this justifies the use of the self - consistent mean - field treatment as a symmetry breaking approach in the same spirit that the semiclassical approximation with a mean collective dipole is applied to the description of optical superradiance .",
    "we have considered single - particle scattering from a trapped two - component degenerate fermi gas when the projectile particle is identical to one of the confined species .",
    "our theoretical treatment is based on a configuration - interaction approach and we predict fano - type scattering resonances that are possible because of inter - atomic pairing .",
    "the scattering resonances are sensitive to the ground state properties of the trapped fermi gas and we have described the key features of the scattering resonances quantitatively .    we have also presented a bcs mean - field approach to the scattering problem and have shown that the non - number conservation of the theory leads to spurious scattering resonances .",
    "we have described in detail the breakdown of bcs theory for this case but have argued that in macroscopic systems where the energy spectrum is highly degenerate , or continuous , the bcs theory may be expected to give accurate results .",
