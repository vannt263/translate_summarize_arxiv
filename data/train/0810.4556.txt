    "sakurai s object is a highly evolved post - agb star that had begun to venture down the white dwarf cooling track when , in 1995 , it underwent sudden rebrightening @xcite due to a final helium shell flash , or very late thermal pulse ( vltp ) @xcite .",
    "since then , sakurai s object has undergone observable changes on timescales of weeks to months , providing an instance in which this very brief stage of evolution experienced by @xmath7 of intermediate - mass stars @xcite could be tracked over a period of only a few years .",
    "several phases of dust production followed the outburst , with a deep optical minimum beginning in early 1999 , such that any changes in the central star have since been inferred from radio and infrared observations @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations and modelling have revealed much about the dust shell formation and the outer regions of the ejecta [ e.g. @xcite ] .    using observations at 2.3  @xmath8 m from 1998 , @xcite modelled overtone co band absorption in the stellar atmosphere to determine a @xmath9c/@xmath10c ratio of @xmath11 , consistent with vltp nucleosynthesis .",
    "in order to follow the development of the ejecta , annual monitoring of the target in the near - infrared has been undertaken .",
    "the discovery of fundamental band ( 4.7  @xmath8 m ) lines of co in the wind was reported by @xcite , based on low resolution spectroscopy obtained in 2002 and 2003 .",
    "here we present the analysis of observations of the co fundamental lines in data obtained between 2003 and 2007 , mostly at higher resolution .",
    "all data presented here were obtained at the united kingdom infrared telescope on mauna kea , hawaii , using the facility spectrographs cgs4 and uist .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "low resolution spectra were predominantly obtained with uist , utilising the @xmath12 and @xmath13 slits , but in one instance ( 2005 august 3 ) cgs4 and its @xmath14 slit were used . for all observations",
    "the telescope was nodded in the standard abba pattern .",
    "standard stars were observed just prior to or after sakurai s object and at airmasses close to those of the target .",
    "the spectra of sakurai s object were ratioed by those of the appropriate calibration stars ( table 1 ) .",
    "flux calibration was performed utilising photometry of the standard stars and colour corrections based on @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibration was obtained from an arc lamp or from telluric absorption lines in the spectrum of the calibration star , and was accurate to better than 0.0001  @xmath8 m for the uist and low resolution cgs4 spectra .    in the case of the cgs4 echelle observations on 2004 june  10 ,",
    "three echelle settings were used with a slit width of @xmath15 to cover the wavelength range 4.68 - 4.77  @xmath8 m at a resolving power of 20000 ( 15  km  s@xmath6 ) . following data reduction",
    ", the three spectra were adjoined after applying small scaling factors to two of the spectra in order to match the continuum levels .",
    "wavelength calibration for these spectra was derived from telluric co lines and is accurate to 3  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ , < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab - par ]",
    "possible contributors to @xmath10c observed in the @xmath10co fundamental band lines are the interstellar medium , the pre - existing pn and the post - vltp ejecta from sakurai s object . the low @xmath17 ratio and high velocity of the material modelled here preclude origins in the ism [ @xmath18 @xcite ] or the evolved pn [ @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20  km  s@xmath6 @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite fitted synthetic spectra to ukirt echelle spectra of sakurai s object from 1998 , modelling the cool stellar atmosphere in the @xmath21 m region . using this technique",
    "they find an isotopic ratio of @xmath9c/@xmath10c @xmath22 in material close to the star , consistent with the vltp interpretation of sakurai s object . here",
    "we find a compatible @xmath9c/@xmath10c ratio in material observed outside the dust shell in 2004 .",
    "figure  [ fig - ratios ] shows model spectra produced by the spherically symmetric shell model described in section  [ sec - sphere ] for different @xmath9c/@xmath10c ratios , superimposed upon the echelle spectrum .",
    "the best fit found by the model is depicted by the solid red line , for a @xmath9c/@xmath10c ratio of 3.5 .",
    "the blue dotted line corresponds to @xmath23 , in which the @xmath10co lines are more pronounced than observed in sakurai s object ( r(4 ) and r(5 ) in particular ) , whereas in the green dashed line , corresponding to @xmath24 , the absorption features are weaker than observed and there is insufficient depression of the continuum level at wavelengths where a @xmath10co line is expected .",
    "the isothermal slab model is in agreement with the best - fit result of the spherically symmetric model , finding @xmath25 .",
    "c/@xmath10c ratios of 10 ( green dashed line ) , 1 ( blue dotted line ) and the best fit of @xmath9c/@xmath10c = 3.5 ( solid red line ) . ]      from the echelle spectrum we measure a fwhm of the co absorption features corresponding to a velocity broadening of @xmath26  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "a gas shell expansion velocity of @xmath27  km  s@xmath6 is obtained from the difference between the mean radial velocity of the blueward edge of the co lines ( @xmath28  km  s@xmath6 ) and the systemic radial velocity ( @xmath29  km  s@xmath6 ) .",
    "the absorption maximum occurs at @xmath30  km  s@xmath6 , while the mean fwzi measures @xmath31  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "thus , assuming spherically symmetric expansion , material contributing to the redward edge of the line is moving at @xmath32  km  s@xmath6 with respect to the observer , i.e. with a velocity of @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 away from the central star , at an angle close to the plane of the sky .",
    "similarly , the blueward edge ( @xmath33  km  s@xmath6 ) corresponds to gaseous motion along the line of sight to the observer .",
    "the fact that we see no emission from the limbs or the far side of the shell supports the model configuration of a star surrounded by concentric shells of dust and gas ; the inferior dust shell obscures the far side of the superior gas shell , hence we detect only the blueshifted gas along the line of sight and do not see the redshifted ( p cygni ) emission .      in 1998 march ,",
    "broad , blueshifted absorption of he  i ( @xmath34 m ) , which was absent from a spectrum of equal resolution obtained in 1997 july , was detected around sakurai s object @xcite .",
    "we assume the he  i and co - bearing materials were mobilised contemporaneously .",
    "taking an expansion velocity of 500  km  s@xmath6 from the time of he  i detection places limits on the outer gas shell radius of @xmath35  km in 2004 june ; increasing to @xmath36  km at the time of the most recent observation in 2007 .",
    "this recent gas radius is comparable with the range on the dust shell radius of @xmath37  km , modelled by @xcite , and approximately 17  times larger than the 1997 dust radius of @xmath38  km determined by @xcite .",
    "the consistent temperatures of co and the continuum source ( table  2 ) indicate at least partial mixing of the gas and dust ; we therefore take the radius of the co shell to be a good approximation for that of the dust shell .",
    "shock acceleration to @xmath39  km  s@xmath6 would result in dissociation of the co. the absence of co in the spectrum of sakurai s object in 1999 could be used to support a hypothesis of co destruction in the 1998 onset of the fast wind , recombining by the 2000 april observation @xcite .",
    "alternatively , we suggest gentle acceleration of the gas by the dust due to radiation pressure . in this scenario",
    "it is expected that some of the dust would precede and hence obscure the gas ; the co only becoming visible with expansion and thinning of the dust shell over time .    assuming a thin , spherically symmetric gas shell , and taking a column density of @xmath40  @xmath41 ( derived by the spherically symmetric shell model ) , we place limits on the total co ejecta mass of @xmath42  kg ( i.e. @xmath43  m@xmath4 ) , dependent on the date the wind commenced .",
    "significant asymmetry or asphericity of the nebular geometry [ e.g. @xcite ] would cause this value to vary .",
    "the equilibrium temperature of the dust at the radius determined in section  [ sec - co ] is @xmath44  k. this is based on assumptions of 1  @xmath8 m graphitic carbon grains @xcite ; a stellar luminosity of 3000  l@xmath45 @xcite and an effective temperature of 5200  k @xcite .",
    "an equilibrium temperature of 320  k at this radius would require an impossibly high luminosity ; a factor of @xmath46 greater than predicted by the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the co temperature of 320  k is also inconsistent with stellar radiation .",
    "this suggests some additional heating mechanism was operating prior to , and during , 2004 .",
    "the most likely mechanism would appear to be associated with collisional heating within the wind as dust and gas velocities equalise and turbulence dissipates .",
    "the kinetic energy in the outflow is more than sufficient to heat the material to the observed temperature .",
    "the flux density at @xmath47 m dropped by a factor of @xmath48 in the 14  months between observations in 2004 and 2005 .",
    "this decline corresponds to a drop in blackbody temperature of @xmath49  k , from 320  k in 2004 to @xmath50  k in 2005 , comparable with @xmath51  k determined by @xcite from @xmath52 observations at 20  @xmath8 m in 2005 april .",
    "this is a much larger drop than in the years just prior to and subsequent to 2004 - 2005 [ figure  [ fig - co1 - 5](a ) ] and may indicate the rapid weakening of this additional heating process .",
    "observations in the @xmath0 m region show weakening of the co and continued cooling of the dust surrounding sakurai s object between 2003 and 2007 , with a particularly marked temperature decrease between 2004 and 2005 .",
    "the 2004 dust temperature is @xmath53  k hotter than can be accounted for by stellar radiation alone .    from an echelle spectrum of",
    "co absorption features around @xmath54 m , we determine a wind velocity of @xmath5  km  s@xmath6 , which we use to estimate an outer gas shell radius of @xmath55  km ( @xmath56  r@xmath45 ) in 2004 . with consistent gas and dust temperatures ( @xmath57 and @xmath58  k , respectively ) , we believe the two components to be at least partially mixed . assuming continuous , uninterrupted expansion of the co away from the central star at constant velocity , the gas shell radius would have reached @xmath36  km ( @xmath59  r@xmath45 ) by the time of the most recent observation of sakurai s object in 2007 june .",
    "we measure a velocity of peak absorption of @xmath30  km  s@xmath6 , comparable with @xmath60  km  s@xmath6 obtained by @xcite for 2003 .    by modelling the co fundamental in a spherically symmetric shell of material surrounding sakurai s object , we have determined an isotopic ratio of @xmath61 .",
    "application of a simple isothermal slab model of absorbing co also yields @xmath62 .",
    "these results are consistent with earlier estimates of this isotopic ratio in this system @xcite .",
    "in particular , agreement with the atmospheric simulations of @xcite demonstrate this low ratio as being consistent with material having been ejected from the central star during the vltp event and being swept out with the fast wind , rather than forming part of the old pn , or existing in the intervening interstellar medium .",
