    "the formation of a coherent bose - einstein condensate from a thermal bose gas is a rich topic of ongoing research @xcite .",

    "a paradigm for this non - equilibrium phase transition is the formation of a homogeneous weakly - interacting bose gas starting from highly non - equilibrium initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the gas is modelled as a classical matter field described by the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "this field undergoes a universal self - ordering into a quasi - condensate , i.e. a coherent superfluid component , and a non - condensed , thermal component .",
    "phase dislocations that become entrapped within the quasi - condensate during this quench give rise to an irregular tangle of quantized vortex lines that permeate the system , as seen in fig .",
    "this corresponds to a state of superfluid turbulence . over time , this turbulent state relaxes , tending towards the vortex - free , partially - condensed equilibrium state of the finite - temperature bose gas .",
    "the aim of our work is to explore the nature of this state of superfluid turbulence , including the characteristics of its decay .",
    "is it similar to turbulence in ordinary ( classical ) fluids ?",
    "the question is natural , because tangles of quantized vortices created in superfluid helium by moving grids or propellers appear to obey classical scaling laws @xcite .    by examining the distribution of kinetic energy over the length scales , the velocity correlation function and the temporal decay of the vortex line density ,",
    "we show that the turbulence resulting from the thermal quench of a bose gas is very different from classical turbulence and any quasi - classical regimes of superfluid turbulence",
    ". instead , it shares key properties with a second state of turbulence @xcite which has also been observed in superfluid helium , called ` ultra - quantum turbulence ' , which has unusual non - classical properties .",
    "we model a weakly - interacting , homogeneous bose gas ( including thermal excitations ) by means of the classical field method @xcite .",
    "the gas is parametrized by a classical matter field @xmath0 , normalized to the total number of particles @xmath1 , and whose evolution follows the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xmath2    the cubic term accounts for the repulsive interactions between the particles , with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the particle mass and @xmath5 is the inter - particle _ s_-wave scattering length ( here @xmath6 ) .",
    "the total energy of the gas is @xmath7    the gpe is conventionally used to model a zero temperature condensate , but it is now established that , provided the modes of the gas are highly occupied , the gas evolves as an ensemble of modes , each of which follows ( to leading order ) the classical trajectory described by the gpe @xcite .",
    "various phenomena have been studied within this classical field formalism , including equilibration dynamics @xcite , critical temperatures @xcite , correlation functions @xcite , vortex nucleation @xcite and decay of vortex rings @xcite , as well as extensions to binary condensates @xcite .    a classical field @xmath0 representing @xmath8 particles is simulated in a cubic periodic box of volume @xmath9 .",
    "we make the gpe dimensionless using the natural units of the homogeneous system : particle number density is expressed in terms of the average value @xmath10 , length in terms of the healing length @xmath11 , speed in terms of the speed of sound @xmath12 , energy in terms of the chemical potential @xmath13 , and time in terms of @xmath14 .",
    "the time evolution is computed using a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme with time step @xmath15 on a @xmath16 grid with isotropic grid spacing @xmath17 .    to ensure that all numerically accessible modes are highly occupied",

    "the spatial grid discretization implies that high momenta are not described ; in effect an ultraviolet cutoff is introduced , @xmath22 for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and the maximum described wave vector amplitude is @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "the condensate fraction @xmath26 of the equilibrium state ( where @xmath27 is the density of the quasi - condensate , to be defined in section [ sec : quasicondensate ] ) is uniquely determined by the number density , @xmath28 , and the energy density , @xmath29 . in practice",
    "these values are controlled by a rescaling of the initial condition @xmath30 so as to modify the uniform value of @xmath31 in the initial condition , with a selection of high momenta coefficients @xmath20 set to zero in order to retain the same number density after rescaling .",
    "the process can be seen for the initial condition in figure [ fig2 ] .",
