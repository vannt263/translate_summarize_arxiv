    "correlations in the nucleus produce a substantial reduction of the occupation probability of single - particle ( sp ) shells with respect to the independent - particle model ( ipm ) prediction .",
    "a substantial part of this depletion is due to the coupling to high - lying excitations reached by the strong short - range and tensor components of the nucleon - nucleon interaction  @xcite . at low energy , the presence of various collective modes may result in a rearrangement of the sp strength distribution around the fermi energy  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , these features can be observed in the @xmath1 reaction as a reduction of the absolute spectroscopic factors for the knockout of a nucleon from a valence shell , as the strong fragmentation of the spectral strength for more deeply bound sp states , and by the appearance of small fragments associated with sp states that are empty in the ipm .",
    "studies of @xmath1 reactions have determined absolute spectroscopic factors in many closed - shell nuclei  @xcite demonstrating that the removal probability for nucleons from these systems is reduced by about 35% with respect to the shell - model predictions .",
    "more recently , also @xmath2 reactions , that involve the emission of two nucleons from the target , have also become feasible  @xcite .",
    "the latter were motivated by the possibility to directly study the high - momentum components , produced by short - range and tensor correlations ( srtc ) , between pairs of nucleons at low energy .",
    "such experiments are now able to disentangle the most relevant lowest states of the residual @xmath3 nucleus  @xcite which are also influenced by the presence of low - energy correlations .",
    "the theoretical study of one- and two - hole spectral functions to understand the results of the above reactions , usually requires substantial efforts in computational many - body physics and does not always give a complete explanation of the observed data .",
    "in particular , the nucleus of @xmath0 is still not completely understood at the microscopic level and theoretical calculations of its properties still fail in two ways .",
    "first , the experimental spectroscopic strength  @xcite for the knockout of a proton from both the @xmath4 and @xmath5 shells corresponds to about @xmath6 .",
    "the outgoing proton is described by a wave distorted by a complex optical potential which describes the corresponding elastic proton scattering data .",
    "this introduces an uncertainty in these spectroscopic factors since the @xmath1 reaction probes the interior of the nucleus , where elastic proton scattering is less sensitive .",
    "the inclusion of a relativistic description of the outgoing proton in the analysis of the data can further change these results somewhat  @xcite .",
    "an assignment of a 5 to 10% error for the absolute spectroscopic factors appears quite reasonable at this time .",
    "several studies have focused on the effect of short - range correlations  @xcite and computed spectroscopic factors directly for @xmath0 .",
    "all these works yield a strength reduction of about 10% in general agreement with expectations based on nuclear - matter calculations  @xcite .",
    "center - of - mass corrections are known to raise the spectroscopic factor by about 7%  @xcite , resulting in a substantial disagreement with data .",
    "the effects of long - range correlations ( lrc ) were studied in refs .",
    "the inclusion of lrc in these works is limited to the tamm - dancoff ( tda ) approximation for the intermediate two - particle@xmath7one - hole ( 2p1h ) and two - hole@xmath7one - particle ( 2h1p ) states in the nucleon self - energy using the g - matrix as a residual interaction .",
    "the reduction of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 spectroscopic factors due to these lrc is about 15% . in the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite , a combined treatment of lrc and srtc was obtained .",
    "the resulting @xmath4 and @xmath5 spectroscopic factors correspond to 77% and 76% of the sp strength , respectively , without inclusion of center - of - mass corrections .",
    "short - range effects were included by employing the energy - dependence of the brueckner g - matrix in the corresponding self - energy contribution .",
    "the resulting disagreement with the experimental data appears to be about 15 - 20% but some allowance for the uncertainty of the extraction of the spectroscopic factors should be factored in .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "@xcite clearly show that a substantial improvement can be obtained by the inclusion of lrc .",
    "looking at the overall picture , a comparison between the quoted results suggests that the quenching produced by srtc appears to be well established . at the same time , low - energy lrc are identified as an essential ingredient that is needed for a complete understanding of the discrepancy with the experimental data .    the second issue regarding @xmath0 concerns a satisfactory understanding of the fragmentation of the sp strength at low energy .",
    "the full one - hole spectral function for small missing energies was computed in ref .",
    "@xcite and the results were subsequently used as a starting point for the study of the @xmath8o(e , e@xmath9pp ) reaction  @xcite .",
    "the high - momentum components of the two - hole overlap function caused by short - range effects were also included by adding the proper defect functions computed directly for the @xmath0 nucleus  @xcite .",
    "these calculations led to a proper description of the experimental cross section for two proton emission  @xcite to the ground state of @xmath10 . in spite of these successes",
    ", the one- and two - hole spectral functions still miss some key features of the fragmentation and do not describe all the relevant low - lying states of the residual nuclei @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the experiments show that the spectral strength for the emission of a @xmath5 proton is fragmented in one big peak and a few smaller ones  @xcite .",
    "the latter are found at a slightly higher missing energy and carry a reasonable amount of strength : of the 60% observed mean - field strength , about 5% is distributed in these small peaks while the rest is in the main fragment .",
    "this feature is not reproduced by the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , where all the strength is concentrated in one single peak .",
    "other experimentally observed hole fragments , like the @xmath12 and @xmath13 found at about -17.4  mev missing energy , are not reproduced as well .",
    "analogously , the spectrum of @xmath10 contains two low - lying isovector @xmath14 levels , that can be reached by two - nucleon emission , but only one of them is reproduced by the above theoretical calculations .",
    "this missing state represents the main discrepancy between the theoretical and experimental @xmath8o(e , e@xmath9pp ) cross sections  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the transition to both of the @xmath14 states can be interpreted as the knockout of two protons from a @xmath4 and a @xmath5 state .",
    "although this has not been directly investigated before , it is natural to suppose a connection exists between the spectrum of @xmath10 and the fragmentation of the @xmath5 strength in @xmath11 .",
    "the presence of a very low - lying @xmath14 state in @xmath0 can also play a role .",
    "the fragmentation of the @xmath5 strength , in turn , can be interpreted as a @xmath5 hole on either the ground state of @xmath0 or one of its low - lying positive parity states . since these spectra and transition amplitudes are naturally linked to each other ,",
    "a formalism in which all of them are obtained in a self - consistent way is desirable , if not necessary , to resolve the above issues .",
    "such self - consistent calculations have sofar been restricted to second - order contributions to the self - energy using a skyrme force for the effective interaction  @xcite .",
    "such a treatment of lrc in @xmath0 is inadequate since it does not include any residual interaction between the intermediate 2p1h and 2h1p states in the self - energy .    the merit of the calculations of refs .",
    "@xcite was that the interaction between the 2p1h states ( and 2h1p states ) was summed to all orders .",
    "thus a simultaneous description of the effects of both particle - hole  ( ph ) and hole - hole  ( hh ) ( as well as particle - particle  ( pp ) ) collective excitations was achieved , including the interplay between them .",
    "these collective excitations , though , were accounted for only at the tda level .",
    "the simultaneous treatment of ph and pp(hh ) excitations is not a trivial problem and an extension of these calculations beyond tda presents serious difficulties  @xcite . on the other hand , in order to account for the coupling to collective excitations that are actually observed in @xmath0 it is necessary to at least consider a random phase approximation ( rpa ) description of the isoscalar negative parity states  @xcite . to account for the low - lying isoscalar positive parity states an even more complicated treatment will be required  @xcite .",
    "sizable collective effects are also present in the particle - particle ( pp ) and hh excitations involving tensor correlations for isoscalar and pair correlations for isovector states . also in this case , an rpa treatment would be relevant .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to extend the calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite to include such rpa correlations .",
    "a formalism has been proposed recently that allows the simultaneous inclusion of ph and pp(hh ) excitations at the rpa level  @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "the rpa collective excitations can be summed to all orders by solving a set of faddeev equations for the motion of 2p1h and 2h1p excitations .",
    "this is done within the framework of self - consistent green s function theory ( scgf ) in which the equations of motion are expressed in terms of the dressed ( fragmented ) sp propagator .",
    "the resulting self - energy contains the inclusion of these pp(hh ) and ph rpa phonons to all orders and therefore allows for an improved description of the influence of lrc on the sp propagator . in turn , the results for the hole ( and particle ) spectral functions can be employed in a subsequent dressed rpa ( drpa ) calculation and then iterated to investigate the effects of self - consistency on the fragmentation .    in sec .",

    "for the solution of the faddeev equations a g - matrix evaluated at a fixed starting energy was employed . in this case a value of -25  mev has been chosen as a suitable average of the most important 2h1p states which are of interest here .    by using an ipm propagator as input green s function , the bhf term  ( [ eq : bhf ] )",
    "was computed and the faddeev equations were solved to obtain the irreducible self - energy of fig .  [",
    "fig : selfenergy ] . from the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dys ] ) the sp spectral functions were obtained .",
    "the solution to the dyson equation  ( [ eq : dys ] ) contains a large number of fragments , most of which are quite small .",
    "a fully self - consistent solution requires a method in which the sp strength is binned over a large energy domain  @xcite .",
    "the number of poles and the resulting 2p1h and 2h1p are then too numerous for a practical solution of the faddeev equations . to obtain some insight into the effects of self - consistency we have chosen the following procedure to account for the fragmentation . for sp levels far from the fermi energy , we have kept two poles above and below the fermi energy , except for the @xmath58 and @xmath59 shells for which only one effective hole pole was kept . for the levels near the fermi energy , the quasiparticle ( hole ) fragment was kept , including its location and strength .",
    "when two effective poles on one side of the fermi energy were included , the fragment closest to the fermi energy was kept with its strength and the rest of the strength was collected at a location determined by weighing the remaining fragment energies with the corresponding strength .",
    "the resulting dressed propagator still contains all the relevant low - energy fragmentation and at the same time it has a number of poles small enough to be used as input in another faddeev drpa calculation .",
    "in performing the iterations , the ph drpa equations that give the spectrum of @xmath0 , generate an instability in the isoscalar @xmath60 channel .",
    "the rpa equations using ipm input do not generate this instability .",
    "no other instabilities are encountered in other channels , including pp or hh ones .",
    "naturally , the instability of the lowest ph @xmath60 state tends to disappear when a more negative starting energy is chosen for the g - matrix since such a choice reduces the attraction in this channel .",
    "since the first @xmath60 state is of particular importance , we decided not to discard it but to compute it in a regime were the instability disappears .",
    "a stable solution for the spectroscopic amplitudes of this state was obtained by solving the ph dpra equations with a g - matrix at a starting energy of -110  mev .",
    "the energy of the state was then kept fixed at the experimental energy of 6.05  mev .",

    "the values of the spectroscopic factors for the main particle and hole shells close to the fermi energy are reported in table  [ tab : ipmpeaks ] .",
    "the hole strengths given by tda are 0.775 for @xmath4 and 0.766 for @xmath5 , in close agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite ( to which the present tda calculation is equivalent ) . the introduction of rpa correlations reduces these values and brings them down to 0.745 and 0.725 , respectively .",
    "this result reduces the discrepancy with the experiment by about 4% and shows that collectivity beyond the tda level is relevant to explain the quenching of spectroscopic factors .",
    "it should be noted that the present rpa results describing the ph and pp ( hh ) spectrum suffer from the usual problems associated with rpa .",
    "one such feature , as already noted above for the ph @xmath60 state , is the appearance of at most one collective state for a given @xmath61 , whereas many low - lying isoscalar natural parity states are observed experimentally .",
    "this feature implies that especially the ph spectrum does not provide a very good description of the experimental data .",
    "one may therefore hope that further improvements of the description of the rpa phonons themselves will close the gap with the experimental data further .    together with the main fragments , the dyson equation produces also a large number of solutions with small spectroscopic factors .",
    "for the one - hole spectral function , this strength extends down to about -130  mev .",
    "this background partly represents the strength that is removed from the main peaks and shifted up to medium missing energies .",
    "the energy dependence of the g - matrix accounts for another 10% effect in pushing the strength of the mostly occupied shells to high energies in the particle domain .",
    "we note that the location of this strength can not be expicitly calculated in the present approach but corresponds to very large energies  @xcite .",
    "the occupation number coming from both the background contribution at negative energies , as well as the main hole fragments is displayed in table  [ tab : ipmstrengths ] for the most important shells . summing these numbers together with the occupation of the main peaks and weighing them by a factor of @xmath62 ,",
    "one gets a total number of particles equal to about 15 nucleons .",
    "this violation of particle number is a consequence of the energy dependence of the g - matrix .",
    "the remaining strength is then accounted for by the presence of high - momentum components due to srtc not explicitly calculated in the present scheme .",

    "the main peak of the @xmath5 remains at 0.722 but the appearance of the secondary fragment slightly increases the overall strength at low energy also .",
    "this behavior can be understood by realizing that with an ipm input most of the phonons are somewhat more collective than the ones obtained from employing dressed propagators with the exception of the special case of the ph @xmath60 . as a result",
    ", one can expect a reduced effect of rpa correlations when fragmentation is included in the construction of the phonons .",
    "this feature has also been observed in other self - consistent calculations of the sp spectral strength , for example in nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "obviously , this makes the disagreement with experiments a little worse and additional work is needed to resolve the disagreement with the data .",
    "nevertheless it is clear that fragmentation is a relevant feature of nuclear systems and that it has to be properly taken into account .",
    "it is also worth nothing that already after a few iterations , all the main quantities of table  [ tab:123itr ] tend to stabilize and sustain themselves in a self - consistent way .",
    "table  [ tab:123itr ] also shows the total number of particles obtained at each iteration ( derived by summing over the hole strength ) .",
    "this result corresponds to about 14.6 nucleons when fragmentation is included .",
    "this gives an estimate for the overall occupancy of high momentum states of about 10% , in agreement with direct calculations of srtc  @xcite .",
    "we observe that this estimate is different from the results for the ipm input quoted in table  [ tab : ipmstrengths ] .",
    "we associate this difference with the energy dependence of the g - matrix which is sampled differently in both cases . in the ipm calculation",
    "the lowest three shells are included at the harmonic oscillator level .",
    "upon iteration , which involves the changing bhf contribution , the admixture of the other @xmath37 and @xmath39 shells is included and will generate a slightly different effect related to the energy dependence of the g - matrix since different matrix elements are sampled in each case .",
    "we note here that for this reason there is also a distinct difference between the quasiparticle and quasihole strengths near the fermi energy as shown in table  [ tab : ipmpeaks ] of about 10% .",
    "this same difference appears in the summed strengths appearing in table  [ tab : ipmstrengths ] . in both cases there",
    "appears more strength in the particle domain that is appropriate for the effect of srtc . in the present approach we can not treat this effect for particle shells properly since the g - matrix can only be calculated reliably at negative energy .",
    "the derivative of the energy dependence of the g - matrix at energies relevant for particle states will therefore not reflect the true depletion due to srtc . for this reason the summed strength for the particle states is close to 1 in table  [ tab : ipmstrengths ] .",
    "the results of the third iteration are also given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdhsf ] for the relevant positive parity spectral functions .",
    "we note that the @xmath13 and @xmath12 hole fragments at -15  mev are no longer generated by these iterated calculations .",
    "also , as a consequence of dressing the input propagator , more poles are produced as solutions of the dyson equation  ( [ eq : dys ] ) .",
    "this allows for a better distribution of the @xmath13 strength at medium missing energies .",
    "similar results have been obtained in the self - consistent second - order calculation for @xmath65 in ref .",
    "presumably , a more complete representation of the strength in the input propagator would further improve the @xmath64 strength distribution .",
    "a deeper insight into the mechanisms that generate the fragmentation pattern can be gained by looking directly at the connection between the spectral function and some specific collective states . to clarify this point we repeated the third iteration using exactly the same input but without replacing the unstable ph @xmath60 state , which was instead discarded .",
    "the resulting @xmath39 hole spectral function is shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : no0 + ] . in this calculation",
    "no breaking of the @xmath5 peak is obtained .",
    "instead a single peak is found with a spectroscopic factor equal to 0.75 which corresponds to the sum of the two fragments that are obtained when the @xmath60 state is taken into account .",
    "this result can be interpreted by considering the @xmath5 fragments as a hole on the ground state and on the first excited @xmath60 state of the @xmath0 core , respectively .",
    "if the latter two levels are close enough to each other in the calculation , a mixing between the two configurations can occur and a second smaller fragment is generated .",
    "when the excited @xmath60 state is removed from the calculation or , like in the tda approach , is found far above the experimental energy , the calculation can reproduce only one single peak .",
    "obviously , it is understood from the dressed results of fig .",
    "[ fig : phsf ] that further improvements have to be made in other to describe properly the strength and the missing energy of the smaller fragments .",
    "a candidate to consider in this improvement is the role of the first @xmath14 state in @xmath0 , which can also couple to generate @xmath5 hole fragments but that was not included here since it can not be obtained by the present ph drpa calculation , at least not at low enough energy .",
    "the other two low - lying states of @xmath0 that may be of some relevance are the isoscalar @xmath67 and @xmath66 .",
    "these excitation are reproduced reasonably well by rpa type calculations  @xcite but are typically found at higher energies than the experimental ones . in the present case",
    "the third iteration gives 9.4 and 10.8  mev for @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively , which is about 3  mev above the experimental results .",
    "this points to a need for a more attractive g - matrix interaction .",
    "we mention here that the present g - matrix is calculated without any binding correction of the sp energies for particle states which could have some influence on the strength of the effective interaction .",
    "the lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : no0 + ] show the results for the even parity spectral functions that are obtained if the @xmath66 alone or both @xmath66 and @xmath67 are shifted down to their experimental values . in this case",
    ", a @xmath12 hole peak is obtained at low missing energy .",
    "this result is also quantitatively more satisfactory that what was obtained in the rpa calculation based on the ipm , since in this case it is found at -17.7  mev ( in agreement with experiment ) and with a spectroscopic strength of 0.5% .",
    "it is interesting to note that the shifting of the @xmath66 collective state does not produce any other noticeable change in the theoretical spectral function .",
    "the same applies if also the @xmath67 is shifted .",
    "it appears therefore that the main impediment for further improvements of the description of the experimental data is associated with the deficiencies of the rpa ( drpa ) description of the excited states .",
    "one important problem is the appearance of at most one collective phonon for a given @xmath68 combination .",
    "experimentally , several low - lying isoscalar @xmath60 and @xmath14 excited states are observed at low energy in @xmath0 as well as additional @xmath66 and @xmath67 states .",
    "a possible way to proceed would be to first concentrate on an improved description of the collective phonons by extending the rpa to explicitly include the coupling to two - particle@xmath7two - hole ( 2p2h ) states .",
    "such an extended rpa procedure has been applied in heavier nuclei with considerable success  @xcite . in order to be relevant for @xmath0 ,",
    "this approach requires an extension in which the coherence of the 2p2h states is included in the form of the presence of two phonon excitations .",
    "such contributions arise naturally when the response is calculated by using the baym - kadanoff construction of the irreducible ph interaction which is based on a self - consistent treatment of the self - energy  @xcite .",
    "in the present paper the faddeev technique has been applied to study 2h1p correlations at small missing energies for the nucleus of @xmath0 .",
    "the application of the faddeev method allows for the first time the treatment of the coupling of ph and hh collective modes within an rpa framework and to all orders in the nucleon self - energy .",
    "the resulting spectral function shows better agreement with experimental data than all previous calculations .",
    "additional encouraging results are obtained in the form low - lying positive parity fragments .",
    "these results were extended by recalculating the rpa phonons using the so - obtained fragmented sp propagator .",
    "the inclusion of this fragmentation in the phonons leads to the appearance of an additional @xmath5 fragment at low energy in agreement with experiment .",
    "other features , like the presence of positive parity @xmath69 and @xmath70 holes at -17  mev , can not be obtained when the present calculations are iterated .",
    "we have further identified the important role played by the low - lying ph states of @xmath0 .",
    "the low - lying @xmath60 appears to be at least partially responsible for the splitting of the @xmath5 strength at low energy , whereas the low - lying @xmath66 state plays a decisive role in the presence of @xmath12 strength at low energy .",
    "the results of the present calculations are therefore very sensitive to the quality of the rpa ( drpa ) description of the ph spectrum .",
    "it is well known that this description is as yet unsatisfactory but key ingredients for further improvements can be identified through the baym - kadanoff procedure based on self - consistent propagators .",
    "we therefore conclude that the present results show that further improvement in the understanding of the low - energy fragmentation can be gained . to do this ,",
    "the employed approximations need to correctly reproduce all the lowest ph collective modes .",
    "we therefore propose to first improve the quality of the rpa phonons before engaging in a fully self - consistent evaluation of the one- and two - hole spectral functions for @xmath0  @xcite .",
