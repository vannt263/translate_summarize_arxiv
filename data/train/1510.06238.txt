    "as progress of quantum theory @xcite moves far ahead , the speed of a quantum evolution gradually becomes a hot issue in the fields of quantum communication and quantum metrology .",
    "the @xmath0 time @xcite is referred to as the minimal evolution time of an arbitrarily driven open quantum system @xcite . to distinguish an initial state and a final state , a geometric approach is provided by the bures angle @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this feasible measure can deduce two types of @xmath0 time , @xmath2 , i.e. , mandelstam - tamm bound ( mt ) @xcite and margolus - levitin bound ( ml ) @xcite .",
    "very recently , some researchers have put forward other methods including fidelity approach @xcite , metric approach @xcite , one based on quantum fisher information @xcite . with respect to the above measurements ,",
    "@xmath2 is closely dependent on an actual driving time @xmath3 for an open system . as noted in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the situation @xmath4 , it indicates that the quantum evolution has no potential capacity for further acceleration .",
    "however , in the situation @xmath5 , the smaller ratio @xmath6 the greater this potential capacity for speedup will be . how to obtain a smaller quantum speed limit time with respect to a given driving time",
    "is a valuable question in the field of open quantum information processing . in response to this issue ,",
    "several feasible solutions are proposed such as changing environmental factors @xcite or initial state @xcite .",
    "for example , we can acquire acceleration of quantum evolution by strengthening the system - environment couplings @xcite or selecting some kinds of special state @xcite as an initial state . for explaining the mechanism for the speedup ,",
    "there is one viewpoint which is focused on the effects of non - markovianity @xcite for a dynamical map . according to some previous results",
    ", entanglement is thought of to be possible resources for the acceleration of the evolution @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the control of quantum systems by electromagnetic fields plays a significant role in a variety of applications of physics . as we know , the weak interaction between systems and environments is always unavoidable in real experiments .",
    "however , in this weak - coupling limit , it is difficult to engender the potential capacity to accelerate the evolution without any external operation",
    ". this motivates us to find out what kind of external conditions can be manipulated in order to induce the occurrence of quantum speedup potential in practical operations . to reasonably consider the effects of external driving and environment temperatures , we apply the second - order time - convolutionless master equation to describe the dynamical behavior of the system . in ultra - low temperature condition ,",
    "the single - excitation approximation used by @xcite is not enough .",
    "we make a weak - coupling approximation in order to use the lorentzian spectral density approach . in the following context",
    ", we will prove that high - excitation states of the system result in some high - frequency oscillating terms which can be neglected in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "besides it , we also consider another equivalent dissipation model to demonstrate the validity of weak - coupling approximation .    in this paper",
    ", we consider noninteracting two - level atoms driven by classical laser fields , which are respectively coupled to independent finite - temperature leaky cavities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model of a driven two - level system interacting with a thermal bosonic environment in weak coupling regime .",
    "the expression of the reduced density matrix for single system is obtained by the time - convolutionless quantum master equation under weak coupling approximation .",
    "the technique of operator projection for open dynamics is then used to derive a general evolution of @xmath7-particle open systems . in sec .",
    "iii , we define a @xmath2 measure based on trace distance . it is found out that the temperature of the reservoir and the driving strength of the laser field may give rise to the acceleration of quantum decoherence with respect to an excited state of single system .",
    "for a given driving time , the change of excited - state population dominates in the measure for @xmath0 time . with the consideration of multi - qubit entanglement of open systems , we study the scaling property of @xmath0 time .",
    "finally , a simple discussion concludes the paper .",
    "in many applications of quantum optics , a two - level atom coupled to a structural reservoir at finite temperature is referred to as a typical model .",
