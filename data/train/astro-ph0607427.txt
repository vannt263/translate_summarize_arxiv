    "as is well known for hundreds of years , the sky would be infinitely bright in optical light , if all space were homogeneously full of stars , and space were infinitely extended without any change in properties  @xcite .",
    "this reasoning can be applied to stars as well as to galaxies .",
    "this argument can also be applied to electromagnetic emissions and just as well to neutrino emission . the solution to olbers paradox",
    "is that space is not homogeneously full of identical distributions of stars or galaxies , and that the universe evolves quite strongly .",
    "this implies that the integral over the optical light of all galaxies has a finite sum , which does not exceed an observable level .",
    "clearly , given a proper sampling of galaxies , it is possible to determine this level . in some cases , there is a unique relationship between the optical light and the emission at some other wavelength .",
    "starting from this correlation , the summed emission from all galaxies over all history can be deduced and it is a simple function of the sum at optical wavelengths . the optical emission can certainly be replaced with the emission at some other electromagnetic wavelength , such as x - rays .",
    "equally , the correlated wavelength can be neutrino emission .",
    "if we now do not know what the sum of the emission is at the electromagnetic wavelength , but have limits , then a limit for the neutrino emission can be deduced a fortiori .",
    "vice versa , if we have a limit for the neutrino emission , a corresponding limit for the electromagnetic emission can be derived . in either case",
    ", it might happen , that we have a known background , and then can deduce whether this specific class of sources could possibly explain all background at the other `` wavelength '' .",
    "we start this argument with neutrinos , set a limit , and then derive a limit for the electromagnetic background .",
    "we could also start with the electromagnetic background , and then set a limit for the neutrino emission .",
    "so we have an _ olbers paradox for neutrinos_. this is the key point of this paper .",
    "more concretely , the interpretation of different amanda neutrino flux limits is done for different classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . in the case of a stacking analysis in which the strongest sources from the same class are selected ,",
    "a method for the interpretation of these limits as limits to the diffuse flux from the given source class is developed .",
    "additionally , future possibilities of second generation neutrino telescopes like icecube and km3net are examined .",
    "different source classes are discussed with respect to their distribution in the sky , i.e.  which sources are in the northern and which are in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the field of view for icecube respectively km3net is the northern respectively the southern hemisphere and their view of the sky is complementary .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ nu_models ] , the prevailing models are discussed according to the normalization options given by experimental observations of cosmic rays ( crs ) and photons at different wavelengths .",
    "it is essential to discuss in this context which stacking limit can be applied to what prediction .",
    "current neutrino flux limits are investigated in section  [ nu_limits : sec ] .",
    "a general ansatz for the interpretation of stacking limits as diffuse limits is presented here . in section  [ stack_results ] , the method is applied to amanda s limits which have been derived by stacking agn according to their electromagnetic output . the question which stacking limits apply to which normalization scenario",
    "is discussed in section  [ compare ] and it is examined how the limits constrain different models . in section  [ class_analysis ] , further source classes are examined according to the possibility of applying the stacking method for high energy neutrinos , i.e.  @xmath0  tev .",
    "in addition , a comparison of the contribution from the northern and southern hemisphere is done for various source classes in order to compare the capabilities of next generation s telescopes icecube and km3net .",
    "the results are summarized in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in some hadronic acceleration models it is assumed that for each class of agn , the electromagnetic emission is correlated to a neutrino signal .",
    "apart from individual normalization factors , the corresponding cosmological integrations are basically mathematically identical . in this section",
    ", the correlation between the emission of neutrinos and photons at different wavelengths will be discussed according to neutrino flux models which are currently being discussed in the literature .",
    "sources of electromagnetic tev emission can be interpreted as optically thin to photon - neutron interactions , @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in hadronic acceleration models . in such a scenario , charged cosmic rays ( crs ) are produced in the vicinity of the source through the decay of the escaping neutrons . in this case , the resulting neutrino energy density would be proportional to the extragalactic cr component measured at earth .",
    "a theoretical upper bound of such a contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux has been derived by mannheim , protheroe and rachen ( in the following referred to as the _ mpr bound _ ) , see @xcite . within the framework of the proton - blazar model , the neutrino flux from high - frequency peaked bl lacs ( hbls )",
    "has been calculated using the connection between cosmic rays and neutrino emission , see  @xcite .      in the case of optically thick sources ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "the photons interact with nucleons in the source before escaping at lower energies leading to the emission of sub - tev photons .",
    "therefore , the diffuse extragalactic background determined by the egret experiment  @xcite ( @xmath3  mev ) can be interpreted as an avalanched tev signal from blazars and can thus be used to normalize the neutrino flux from egret or comptel - type sources .",
    "again , mpr give an upper bound to the contribution from such sources in  @xcite , which is much less restrictive than the optically thin case .",
    "apart from the bound , a calculation of the maximum contribution from blazars is given in  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the contribution from hbls within the framework of the proton - blazar model , a contribution from the optically thick low - frequency peaked bl lacs ( lbls ) can be calculated using the egret diffuse extragalactic background for a normalization of the neutrino spectrum , see  @xcite . a model of @xmath4 interactions in agn and collisions of protons from the core with protons of the host galaxy",
    "is derived in  @xcite .",
    "this model will be referred to as _",
    "m95-a_. alternatively to optically thin sources with photon emission above @xmath5  mev , the environment can be optically thick allowing only photons below @xmath5  mev to escape . in that case",
    ", the neutrino signal can be normalized to the diffuse extragalactic contribution measured by comptel at energies in the range of @xmath6  mev  @xcite .",
    "this would enhance the contribution of neutrinos from @xmath4 by almost an order of magnitude as shown in  @xcite",
    ". we will refer to this model as _",
    "m95-b _ in the following .",
    "a model by  @xcite was originally using the diffuse cosmic x - ray background ( see sec .",
    "[ rosat_prediction ] ) and has recently been modified in a way that it is using the comptel diffuse background to normalize the neutrino spectrum  @xcite .",
    "this reduces the formerly very high contribution by a factor of 10 .",
    "in addition , oscillations have been taken into account which leads to a further reduction by a factor of 2 .",
    "the measurement of the diffuse extragalactic contribution in x - rays by rosat has raised the question whether it is produced by radio - weak agn .",
    "assuming that the x - ray emission comes from the foot of the jet , the x - ray signal would be accompanied by a neutrino flux . a model by  @xcite and an approach by  @xcite have been presented",
    ". an alternative scenario would be the up - scattering of thermal electrons via the inverse compton effect . in that case",
    ", the x - ray component would not be accompanied by a neutrino signal , see e.g  @xcite . until today",
    ", about @xmath7 of the diffuse x - ray signal has been resolved by rosat  @xcite , with the help of chandra and xmm - newton data , this number can be updated to @xmath8 , see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "more than @xmath9 of the diffuse background could be connected to the x - ray emission of active galactic nuclei most of which are radio weak .",
    "amanda s measurements of a diffuse neutrino flux did not yield a significant signal and constrains these models strongly .",
    "detailed examination of multi - wavelength observations have shown a correlation between the disk and jet power of active galactic nuclei , see  @xcite .",
    "this correlation can be used to determine the diffuse neutrino flux from fr - ii galaxies and flat spectrum radio quasars within the framework of the jet - disk symbiosis model  @xcite .",
    "the neutrino flux has been assumed to follow an @xmath10 spectrum which leads to a relatively high neutrino flux at energies above tev energies .",
    "assuming on the other hand a correlation between the radio spectral index and the index of the proton spectrum leads to an @xmath11 neutrino spectrum .",
    "since the flux is normalized at low energies , the contribution decreases significantly at higher energies with an increasing spectral index .",
    "the conversion of stacking limits into stacking diffuse limits is the main topic of this section .",
    "basically we use the contribution of the identified sources to the integrated background at a chosen electromagnetic wavelength to estimate by way of a physical model the corresponding ratio for neutrinos : what fraction of identified neutrino source candidates goes towards the integrated background ?",
    "it is important to note here that we use conservative estimates in order to obtain absolute , reliable upper limits . as limits to the flux of identified source classes we use the sample of agn classes from the amanda stacking analysis which",
    "is described in  @xcite .    to avoid any confusion of the notation",

    "the integral sample can improve the stacking analysis of hard x - ray sources which has been done with heao - a information .",
    "only three northern sources were reported from heao - a . for a diffuse interpretation , there are still too few sources in the sample , though .",
    "the catalog fr - i and fr - ii sources is restricted to values of @xmath158 .",

    "[ fr_ii_cat ] for fr - ii galaxies .",
    "the flux is totally dominated by the northern hemisphere .",

    "8 southern and 20 northern sources have been identified with the main contribution from the northern hemisphere .      in the sample of qsos",
    "as presented by  @xcite , there are only 3 sources in the southern hemisphere with a measured flux at the selection wavelength , @xmath161 m .",
    "the sample selection of the sample was done for @xmath162 , which only leaves a small window on the southern sky .",
    "while this source class is well - suited for the analysis of the northern hemisphere , there is too little data available in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the catalog of starburst galaxies includes 199 sources .",
    "while the most luminous sources are in the southern , the total flux is higher in the northern hemisphere , since 153 of 199 sources are located north .",
    "a stacking analysis has good potential for both hemispheres .",
    "in this paper , limits to the diffuse flux from seven different agn source classes could be derived from point source stacking limits from amanda .",
    "there is in many cases an additional constraint on flux models at the lowest energies : while the general diffuse limit is restricted to the energy band of @xmath22  gev to @xmath23  gev , the stacking limits reach down to @xmath163  gev . in many cases ,",
    "the diffusive factor can conservatively only be estimated .",
    "it is expected , that the additional diffuse component is much smaller than the values derived here as upper limits .",
    "a reduction of the diffusive factor would result in the improvement of the stacking diffuse limits .",
    "neutrino flux predictions normalized to the diffuse egret signal above @xmath5  mev use the assumption that the diffuse component is produced by unresolved agn , see  @xcite .",
    "thus , the egret stacking limit applies to such calculations .",
    "the limit falls short of the outline of two of the models , @xcite .",
    "the model of proton - proton interactions normalized to the egret diffuse results violates the limit at low energies around @xmath163  gev . at the highest energies , the stacking diffuse limit is more restrictive than the general diffuse limit and reaches below sensitivities of the maximum contribution from proton - photon interactions",
    ". a detection of a flux from optically thick blazars should be visible with second generation neutrino telescopes such as icecube .      in the case of x - ray agn , the limit",
    "strongly disfavors a hadronic model .",
    "it is an order of magnitude below the flux predictions . according to the strongly restrictive limit , neutrinos",
    "are not produced at the foot of agn jets in coincidence with x - rays .",
    "thus , the diffuse emission as measured by rosat is likely to be due to inverse compton radiation .    analyzing the correlation between the radio and neutrino emission from fr - ii galaxies and blazars ,",
    "the limit was used to constrain the optical depth of the sources . for fr - ii galaxies ,",
    "@xmath164 could be derived , while the upper limit for blazars is given as @xmath165 .",
    "thus , the detection potential for such a source class in icecube is very high , since within three years , icecube is sensitive to sources of optical depth with @xmath166 ( fr - ii ) resp .",
    "@xmath167 ( blazars ) .",
    "it was shown that a general diffuse analysis gives a high discovery potential for hidden tev sources : while tev photons are absorbed at high redshifts , neutrinos propagate freely . an upper limit to the neutrino flux from photon - resolved tev blazars",
    "is determined to be @xmath168    the considerations above show that an investigation of a neutrino signal can be used to help determining different intrinsic parameters of the source type considered . it could be shown that a stacking analysis yields valuable information on the diffuse contribution from theses sources .",
    "the detection probability is enlarged significantly in such an approach and there is a high detection potential with icecube and km3net . a cascade stacking analysis by these neutrino detection arrays should be considered in order to increase the sensitivity to ultra high energy neutrino fluxes as they are described by  @xcite .    apart from the catalogs which have already been used in the stacking analysis of amanda , further source classes are investigated here . the possibility of a stacking analysis of comptel sources is discussed in this paper as a first approach to examine optically thick sources with photon emission of @xmath146  mev . although no stacking diffuse limit can be derived yet due to the small percentage of resolved sources , future experiments such as glast at an energy range of @xmath169  gev  @xcite and mega at @xmath170  mev  @xcite give hope to resolve many more sources in the mev range .",
    "another interesting source class is the catalog of starburst galaxies . with the correlation between starforming regions and long duration gamma ray bursts ,",
    "an enhanced neutrino signal from starbursts can be expected .",
    "the prospects of icecube and km3net are different considering source stacking .",
    "most catalogs show a bias to one of the hemispheres .",
    "both neutrino detection arrays can be used to extract complementary information about the different source classes .    the upper limits derived in this paper constraint several prevailing neutrino flux models .",
    "this underlines the necessity of calculation on the basis of new developments within astroparticle physics and numerical approaches . a unified model concerning acceleration processes in agn",
    "would give the opportunity to examine a potential neutrino signal with respect to different agn classes within the same framework .",
    "the numerical results could be applied to individual sources and to diffuse flux measurements .",
