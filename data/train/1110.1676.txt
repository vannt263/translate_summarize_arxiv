    "blind source separation ( bss ) is a major area of research in signal and image processing .",
    "it aims at recovering source signals from their mixtures without detailed knowledge of the mixing process .",
    "applications of bss include signal analysis and processing of speech , image , and biomedical signals , especially , signal extraction , enhancement , denoising , model reduction and classification problems @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to study new bss methods for nearly degenerate data arising from nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy .",
    "the bss problem is defined by the following matrix model @xmath1 where @xmath2 .",
    "rows of @xmath3 represents the measured mixed signals , rows of @xmath4 are the source signals .",
    "the @xmath5 are sampled functions of an acquisition variable which may be time , frequency , position , wavenumber , etc , depending on the underlying physical process .",
    "hence there are @xmath6 samples in the measurements .",
    "the objective of bss is to solve for @xmath7 and @xmath4 given @xmath3 . in the context of nmr spectroscopy ,",
    "the mixing coefficients are not typically measured .",
    "this is where bss techniques become useful .",
    "the problem is also known as nonnegative matrix factorization ( nmf @xcite ) .",
    "similar to factorizing a composite number ( @xmath8 ) , there are permutation and scaling ambiguities in solutions to bss . for any permutation matrix @xmath9 and invertible diagonal matrix @xmath10 , ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 )",
    "is another pair equivalent to the solution @xmath13 , since @xmath14    various bss methods have been proposed relying on _ priori _ knowledge of source signals such as spatio - temporal decorrelation , statistical independence , sparseness , nonnegativity , etc , @xcite .",
    "recently there have been considerable interests for solving nonnegative bss problems , which emerge in computer tomography , biomedical image processing , nmr spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this work is originated from analytic chemistry , in particular , nmr spectroscopy .",
    "applications include identification of organic compounds , metabolic fingerprinting , disease diagnosis , and drug design . as chemical mixtures abound in human organs , for example , blood , urine , and metabolites in brain and muscles .",
    "each compound has a unique spectral fingerprint defined by the number , intensity and locations of its nmr peaks . in drug design",
    ", structural information must be isolated from spectra that also contain the target molecule , side products , and impurities .",
    "the different spectra come from fourier transform of nmr measurement of absorbance of radio frequency radiation by receptive nuclear spins of the same mixture sample at different time segments when exposed to high magnetic fields .",
    "the nmr spectra are nonnegative . besides , nmr spectra of different chemical compounds are usually not independent , especially as compounds ( component molecules ) have similar functional groups , the peaks overlap in the composite nmr spectra making it difficult to identify the compounds involved .",
    "ica - type approaches recover independent source signals and thus are unable to separate nmr source spectra .",
    "new methods need to be invented to handle this class of data .",
    "recently nonnegative bss has been attracted considerable attention in nmr spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "for example , naanaa and nuzillard ( nn ) proposed a nonnegative bss method in @xcite based on a strict local sparseness assumption of the source signals .",
    "the nn assumption ( nna ) requires the source signals to be strictly non - overlapping at some locations of acquisition variable ( e.g. , frequency ) . in other words ,",
    "each source signal must have a stand - alone peak where other sources are strictly zero there .",
    "such a strict sparseness condition leads to a dramatic mathematical simplification of a general nonnegative matrix factorization problem ( [ lmm ] ) which is non - convex . geometrically speaking",
    ", the problem of finding the mixing matrix @xmath7 reduces to the identification of a minimal cone containing the columns of mixture matrix @xmath3 .",
    "the latter can be achieved by linear programming .",
    "in fact , nn s sparseness assumption and the geometric construction of columns of @xmath7 were known in the 1990 s @xcite in the problem of blind hyper - spectral unmixing , where the same mathematical model ( [ lmm ] ) is used .",
    "the analogue of nn s assumption is called pixel purity assumption @xcite . the resulting geometric ( cone ) method is the so called n - findr @xcite , and is now a benchmark in hyperspectral unmixing .",
    "nn s method can be viewed as an application of n - findr to nmr data .",
    "it is possible that measured nmr data may not strictly satisfy nn s sparseness conditions , which introduces spurious peaks in the results .",
    "postprocessing methods have been developed to address the resulting errors .",
    "such a study has been performed recently in case of ( over)-determined mixtures @xcite where it is found that larger peaks in the signals are more reliable and can be used to minimize errors due to lack of strict sparseness .    in this paper , we consider how to separate the data if nn assumption is not satisfied .",
    "we are concerned with the regime where source signals do not have stand - alone peaks yet one source signal dominates others over certain intervals of acquisition variable . in other words , a dominant interval(s ) condition ( di ) is required for source signals .",
    "this is a reasonable condition for many nmr spectra .",
    "for example , the di condition holds well in the nmr data which motivated us .",
    "the data is produced by the so - called dosy ( diffusion ordered spectroscopy ) experiment where a physical sample of mixed chemical compounds in solvent ( water ) is prepared .",
    "dosy tries to distinguish the chemicals based on variation in their diffusion rates",
    ". however , dosy fails to separate them if the compounds have similar chemical functional groups ( i.e. , they have similar diffusion rates ) . in this application ,",
    "the diffusion rates of the chemicals serve as the mixing coefficients .",
    "this presents an additional mathematical challenge due to the near singularity of the mixing matrix .",
    "separating these degenerate data is intractable to the convex cone methods , thus we are prompted to develop new approaches .",
    "examination the di condition reveals a great deal about the geometry of the mixtures .",
    "actually , the scattered plot of columns of @xmath3 must contain several clusters of points , and these clusters are centered at columns of @xmath7 .",
    "hence , the problem of finding @xmath7 boils down to the identification of the clusters , and it can be accomplished by data clustering , for example , k - means . although the data clustering in general produces a fairly good estimate of the mixing matrix , its output deviates from the true solution due to the presence of the noise , initial guess of the clustering algorithm , and so on . in the case of nearly singular mixing matrix , a small perturbation can lead to large errors in the source recovery ( e.g. , spurious peaks ) . to overcome this difficulty and improve robustness of the separation , we propose two different methods .",
    "one is to find a better estimation of mixing matrix by allowing a constrained perturbation to the clustering output , and it is achieved by a quadratic programming . the intention is to move the estimation closer to the true solution . the other is to seek sparse source signals by exploiting the di condition .",
    "an @xmath0 optimization problem is formulated for recovering the source signals .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows ; in section 2 , we shall review the essentials of nn approach , then we propose a new condition on the source signals motivated by nmr spectroscopy data . in section 3 ,",
    "we introduce the method . in section 4 ,",
    "we further illustrate our method with numerical examples including the processing of an experimental dosy nmr data set .",
    "section 5 is the conclusion .",
    "we shall use the following notations throughout the paper .",
    "the notation @xmath15 stands for the @xmath16-th column of matrix @xmath7 , @xmath17 for the @xmath16-th column of matrix @xmath4 , @xmath18 the @xmath16-th column of matrix @xmath3 . while @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the @xmath16-th rows of matrix @xmath4 and @xmath3 , or the @xmath16-th source and mixture , respectively .",
    "this work was partially supported by nsf - adt grant dms-0911277 and nsf grant dms-0712881 .",
    "the authors thank professor a.j .",
    "shaka and dr .",
    "hasan celik for helpful discussions and their experimental nmr data .",
    "in the paper , we shall consider the determined case ( @xmath21 ) , although the results can be easily extended to the over - determined case ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "consider the linear model ( [ lmm ] ) where each column in @xmath3 represents data collected at a particular value of the acquisition variable , and each row represents a mixture spectrum . in this section , we shall first discuss the briefs of nn method , then introduce the new source conditions and the method .",
    "in @xcite , naanaa and nuzillard ( nn ) presented an efficient sparse bss method and its mathematical analysis for nonnegative and partially orthogonal signals such as nmr spectra .",
    "consider the ( over)-determined regime where the number of mixtures is no less than that of sources ( @xmath23 ) , and the mixing matrix @xmath7 is full rank . in simple terms ,",
    "nn s key sparseness assumption ( referred to as nna below ) on source signals is that each source has a stand - alone peak at some location of the acquisition variable where the other sources are identically zero .",
    "more precisely , the source matrix @xmath24 is assumed to satisfy the following condition    : for each @xmath25 there exists an @xmath26 such that @xmath27 and @xmath28    eq .",
    "( [ lmm ] ) can be rewritten in terms of columns as @xmath29 where @xmath30 denote the @xmath16th column of @xmath3 , and @xmath31 the @xmath32th column of @xmath7 .",
    "assumption nna implies that @xmath33 or @xmath34 .",
    "( [ lincomb ] ) is rewritten as @xmath35 which says that every column of @xmath3 is a nonnegative linear combination of the columns of @xmath36 .",
    "here @xmath37 $ ] is the submatrix of @xmath3 consisting of @xmath38 columns each of which is collinear to a particular column of @xmath7 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath39 are not known and have to be computed .",
    "once all the @xmath40 are found , an estimation of the mixing matrix is obtained .",
    "the identification of @xmath41 columns is equivalent to identifying a convex cone of a finite collection of vectors .",
    "the cone encloses the data columns in matrix @xmath3 , and is the smallest of such cones .",
    "such a minimal enclosing convex cone can be found by linear programming methods .",
    "mathematically , the following constrained equations are formulated for the identification of @xmath36 , @xmath42 then any column @xmath43 will be a column of @xmath36 if and only if the constrained equation ( [ lpnf ] ) is inconsistent . however ,",
    "if noises are present , the following optimization problems are suggested to estimate the mixing matrix @xmath44 a score is associated with each column .",
    "a column with a low score is unlikely to be a column of @xmath36 because this column is roughly a nonnegative linear combination of the other columns of @xmath3 . on the other hand",
    ", a high score means that the corresponding column is far from being a nonnegative linear combination of other columns .",
    "practically , the @xmath38 columns from @xmath3 with highest scores are selected to form @xmath36 , the mixing matrix .",
    "the moore - penrose inverse @xmath45 of @xmath36 is then computed and an estimate to @xmath4 is obtained : @xmath46 .",
    "nn method proves to be both accurate and efficient if nna condition holds .",
    "however , if the condition is not satisfied , errors and artifacts may be introduced because the true mixing matrix is no longer the smallest enclosing convex cone of columns of the data matrix .",
    "recently , the authors have developed postprocessing techniques on how to improve nn results with abundance of mixture data , and how to improve mixing matrix estimation with major peak based corrections @xcite .",
    "the work in @xcite actually considered a relaxed nna ( rnna ) condition    : for each @xmath25 there exists an @xmath47 such that @xmath27 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "simply said , each source signal has a dominant peak at acquisition position where the other sources are allowed to be nonzero .",
    "nna condition recovers if all @xmath50 .",
    "the rnna is more realistic and robust than the ideal nna for real - world nmr data @xcite .      motivated by the dosy nmr spectra",
    ", we propose here a different relaxed nn condition on the source signals .",
    "note that the rows @xmath51 of @xmath4 are the source signals , and they are required to satisfy the following condition : for @xmath52 , source signal @xmath53 is required to have dominant interval(s ) over @xmath54 , while @xmath53 is allowed to overlap with other signals at the rest of the acquisition region .",
    "more formally , it implies that source matrix @xmath4 satisfies the following condition    for each @xmath55 , there is a set @xmath56 such that for each @xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "we shall call this dominant interval condition , or di condition . fig .",
    "[ sourcecondition ] is an idealized example of three di source signals .",
    "in addition to the di source condition , the mixing matrix is required to be near singular .",
    "the motivation is the similar diffusion rates of the chemicals with similar structure .",
    "this poses a mathematical challenge to invert a near singular matrix , since a small error in the recovered mixing matrix might lead to a considerable deviation in the source recovery . among the singularly mixed signals ( or degenerate data ) ,",
    "in this paper we shall consider the following two types : 1 ) columns of the mixing matrix are parallel ; 2 ) one column of the mixing matrix is a nonnegative linear combination of others .",
    "case 1 is motivated by nmr of the chemicals with similar diffusion rate . we shall call this condition parallel column condition , or pcc .",
    "case 2 can also be encountered in nmr spectroscopy of chemicals , and we shall call it one column degenerate condition , or ocdc . please note that both pcc and ocdc should be considered to hold approximately in real - world data .",
    "now suppose we have a set of nearly degenerate signals from di sources .",
    "we require that compared to the size of dominant interval(s ) in the acquisition region , the source signals overlapping region is much smaller .",
    "in fact , this is a reasonable assumption for the nmr data which motivates us .",
    "more importantly , this requirement enables the success of the clustering method .",
    "next , we shall estimate the columns of mixing matrix @xmath7 by data clustering .",
    "the dominant interval(s ) from each of the source signals implies that there is a region where the source @xmath59 dominates others .",
    "more precisely , there are columns of @xmath3 such that @xmath60 where @xmath61 dominate @xmath62 , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "the identification of @xmath64 @xmath65 is equivalent to finding a cluster formed by these @xmath66 s in @xmath67 . as illustrated in the geometry plot of @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ sourcecondition ] , three clusters are formed .",
    "many clustering techniques are available for locating these clusters , for example , k - means is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well known clustering problem .",
    "we shall use k - means analysis in this paper because it is computationally fast , and easy to implement .",
    "consider an example of three di source signals with ocdc mixing matrix condition , the three centers are shown in fig .",
    "[ sourcecondition ] . for real - world data",
    ", we show an example of nmr spectra of quinine , geraniol , and camphor mixture in fig .",
    "[ real_data ] .",
    "the clusters in the middle implies that ocdc condition hold well for this data . apparently , nn method ( and other convex cone methods ) would fail to separate the source signals due to the degeneracy of the mixing matrix",
    ". it might be able to identify two columns of @xmath7 as the two edges , it by no means can locate @xmath7 s degenerate column .",
    "for the pcc degenerate case , clustering is also able to deliver a good estimation , even when the data is contaminated by noise .",
    "we show the results in fig .",
    "[ real_data_pcc ] where the three clusters are very close due to the pcc degeneracy .",
    "nn solution would deviate considerably from the true solution .",
    "for the data we tested , clustering techniques like k - means works well when the condition number of the mixing matrix is up to @xmath68 .",
    "though the solutions of mixing matrix by clustering methods are rather good estimation to the true solution , small deviations from the true ones will introduce large errors in the source recovery ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "next we propose two approaches to overcome this difficulty .",
    "both approaches need to solve optimization problems .",

    "<S> the motivation lies in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy , where a multiple mixture nmr spectra are recorded to identify chemical compounds with similar structures ( degeneracy ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been a number of successful approaches for solving bss problems by exploiting the nature of source signals . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , independent component analysis ( ica ) is used to separate statistically independent ( orthogonal ) source signals . however , signal orthogonality is not guaranteed in many real - world problems . </S>",
    "<S> this new bss method developed here deals with nonorthogonal signals . </S>",
    "<S> the independence assumption is replaced by a condition which requires dominant interval(s ) ( di ) from each of source signals over others . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the mixing matrix is assumed to be nearly singular . </S>",
    "<S> the method first estimates the mixing matrix by exploiting geometry in data clustering . due to </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy of the data , a small deviation in the estimation may introduce errors ( spurious peaks of negative values in most cases ) in the output . to resolve this challenging problem and improve robustness of the separation , </S>",
    "<S> methods are developed in two aspects . </S>",
    "<S> one technique is to find a better estimation of the mixing matrix by allowing a constrained perturbation to the clustering output , and it can be achieved by a quadratic programming . the other is to seek sparse source signals by exploiting the di condition , and it solves an @xmath0 optimization . </S>",
    "<S> we present numerical results of nmr data to show the performance and reliability of the method in the applications arising in nmr spectroscopy .    </S>",
