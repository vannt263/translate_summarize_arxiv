    "the fundamental group of the complement of plane curves is a very important topological invariant , which can be also computed for line arrangements . we list here some applications of this invariant .",

    "these results motivate the following definition :    let @xmath25 be a fundamental group of the affine or projective complements of some line arrangement with @xmath16 lines .",
    "we say that @xmath25 has _ a conjugation - free geometric presentation _ if @xmath25 has a presentation with the following properties :    * in the affine case , the generators @xmath26 are the meridians of lines at some far side of the arrangement , and therefore the number of generators is equal to @xmath16 . * in the projective case , the generators are the meridians of lines at some far side of the arrangement except for one , and therefore the number of generators is equal to @xmath27 . * in both cases , the relations are of the following type : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an increasing subsequence of indices , where @xmath30 in the affine case and @xmath31 in the projective case .",

    "based on the last definition , fan s result yields that if the graph associated to the arrangement is acyclic , then the corresponding fundamental group has a conjugation - free geometric presentation .    the following natural problem arises :    which line arrangements have a fundamental group which has a conjugation - free geometric presentation ?",
    "the aim of this paper is to attack this problem .",
    "the importance of this family of arrangements is that the fundamental group can be read directly from the arrangement or equivalently from its incidence lattice ( where the _ incidence lattice _ of an arrangement is the partially - ordered set of non - empty intersections of the lines , ordered by inclusion , see @xcite ) without any computation .",
    "hence , for this family of arrangements , the incidence lattice determines the fundamental group of the complement .",
    "we start with the easy fact that there exist arrangements whose fundamental groups have no conjugation - free geometric presentation : the fundamental group of the affine ceva arrangement ( also known as the _ braid arrangement _ , appears in figure [ ceva ] ) has no conjugation - free geometric presentation .",
    "this fact was checked computationally by a package called _ testisom _",
    "@xcite , which looks for isomorphisms ( or proves a non - isomorphism ) between two given finitely - presented group .",
    "note that the ceva arrangement is the minimal arrangement ( with respect to the number of lines ) with this property .",
    "our main result is :    the fundamental group of following family of real arrangements have a conjugation - free geometric presentation : an arrangement @xmath0 , where @xmath15 is a union of disjoint cycles of any length , has no line with more than two multiple points , and the multiplicities of the multiple points are arbitrary .",
    "we also give the exact group structure ( by means of a semi - direct product ) of the fundamental group for an arrangement of @xmath1 lines whose graph is a cycle of length @xmath2 ( i.e. a triangle ) , where all the multiple points are of multiplicity @xmath2 :    let @xmath0 be the real arrangement of @xmath1 lines , whose graph consists of a cycle of length @xmath2 , where all the multiple points are of multiplicity @xmath2 .",

    "there are some well - known families of arrangements whose lattice determines the fundamental group of its complement - the families of _ nice _ arrangements ( jiang - yau @xcite ) and _ simple _ arrangements ( wang - yau @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to study the relation between these families and the family of arrangements whose fundamental groups have conjugation - free geometric presentations , since for the latter family , the lattice determines the fundamental group of the complement too .",
    "we have the following remark :    the fundamental group of the arrangement @xmath35 ( appears in figure [ a_n ] ) has a conjugation - free geometric presentation ( this fact was checked computationally ) , but this arrangement is neither nice nor simple",
    ".    it will be interesting to find out whether our family of arrangements is broader than the family of simple arrangements , or whether there exists a simple arrangement whose fundamental group has no conjugation - free geometric presentation .",
    "[ rem_dehornoy ] it is worth to mention that conjugation - free geometric presentations are complemented positive presentations ( defined by dehornoy @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",

    "second , moving a line that participates in only one multiple point over a different line ( see figure [ triangle - line ] ) is permitted in the case of a triangle due to a result of fan @xcite that the family of configurations with @xmath1 lines and three triple points is connected by a finite sequence of smooth equisingular deformations .",
