    "an effective spin exchange between magnetic impurities diluted in a host metallic matrix is inhomogeneous and does not prefer either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic alignment of the impurity spins .",
    "it is hence natural to simulate such a magnetic behavior by a random distribution of the spin exchange as introduced by edwards and anderson.@xcite frustration in the spin exchange induced by static randomness has since then become the hallmark of microscopic models of spin glasses . due to complexity of spin - glass models , majority of theoretical research of spin glasses has concentrated on mean - field properties of the ising spin glass proposed by sherrington and kirkpatrick.@xcite although we have by now a consistent comprehensive solution of the sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model in form of the replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) scheme of parisi,@xcite there remain a few issues where a conclusive answer is still pending .",
    "one of unsettling features in spin - glass models is the way the mean - field solution and its interpretation are obtained . on one hand ,",
    "the replica trick and replicas of the spin variables are used to convert the static randomness to a dynamical , thermal - like averaging and to offer a necessary space for introduction of symmetry breaking order parameters .",
    "they are overlaps between different spin replicas @xmath1 .",
    "the brackets denote joint thermal and configurational averaging .",
    "the physical interpretation of the replica order parameters can , however , be reached only within a thermodynamic approach where a mean - field free energy is first constructed for typical configurations of the spin - exchange . in this thermodynamic approach pioneered by thouless , anderson and palmer ( tap)@xcite we have only local magnetizations @xmath2 , thermally averaged local spins , as order parameters for the ising spin glass . to complete the mean - field solution , a relation between the local magnetizations from the tap approach and the averaged replica parameters must be established .",
    "it was successfully done within the so - called cavity method with many metastable tap states.@xcite    the existence of a multiple of solutions to the tap equations has been demonstrated both directly@xcite and also indirectly.@xcite within the cavity method the parameters @xmath3 , overlaps between local magnetizations from different pure ( metastable ) states , were related to the rsb parameters @xmath4 .",
    "however , the order parameters from the rsb construction can generally be represented as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the overlap of local magnetizations between different spin replicas ( should not be identified with different metastable states ) and @xmath7 is the local overlap susceptibility .",
    "it is just only the special case of the non - replicated ising model ( @xmath8 ) where the overlap susceptibility in the tap construction with a single equilibrium state can be expressed via local magnetizations . if we investigate vector spin glasses@xcite or assume the existence of many quasi - equilibrium states we can not get rid of local susceptibilities as independent order parameters .",
    "it indeed appears that the local magnetizations @xmath9 of the tap theory fail in determining unambiguously the equilibrium thermodynamic states .",
    "it has been demonstrated by numerical means that there is a macroscopic portion of configurations of the spin exchange for which we are either unable to find a stable solution of the tap equations at low temperatures@xcite or we have paired stable and unstable solutions with nearly the same energies.@xcite it means that macroscopic parameters , temperature and external magnetic field , do not determine uniquely local magnetizations and it is unclear whether there is an equilibrium tap state at all temperatures . in such a case",
    "the tap free energy is no longer thermodynamically homogeneous and solutions of the tap equations depend on initial / boundary conditions .",
    "we have to introduce spin replicas and overlap local susceptibilities emerge as natural order parameters.@xcite    the aim of this paper is to trace down the genesis of the order parameters @xmath4 from the rsb scheme within the thermodynamic tap - like approach .",
    "in particular , we analyze the role of local magnetizations @xmath10 with their averaged overlaps @xmath11 and averaged local susceptibilities @xmath12 in the mean - field free energy of a general @xmath0-component spin - glass model with spin components @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "we employ the replicated tap theory from ref .   as the simplest example of an @xmath0-component spin model and find that not the local magnetizations and their averaged overlaps @xmath11 , but rather the overlap local susceptibilities @xmath12 seem to be relevant order parameters in the spin glass phase . to demonstrate this we first analyze two real replicas of ising spin variables . using the replica - symmetric ansatz we then",

    "is very general and covers vector spin models as well as replicated spin models that we will need for the investigation of thermodynamic homogeneity .",

    "the volume - dependence just compensates for the infinite range of the spin exchange . thereby the energy remains linearly proportional to the volume and we can expect that the mean - field solution emulates the thermodynamic properties of realistic models in a sense reliably or at least consistently .",
    "one of fundamental properties of thermodynamic systems is thermodynamic homogeneity .",
    "it says that thermodynamic potentials are products of the volume and functions where all extensive variables enter only via their spatial densities .",
    "thermodynamic homogeneity is normally expressed as the euler lemma @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an arbitrary positive number and the set @xmath23 covers all extensive variables , the thermodynamic potential @xmath24 depends on .",
    "only if this homogeneity condition is fulfilled by thermodynamic potentials we can prove the gibbs - duhem relation and the thermodynamic limit does not depend on the shape of the volume and on boundary / initial conditions .",
    "the simplest example of a thermodynamically inhomogeneous systems is the classical ideal gas with distinguishable particles ( gibbs paradox ) .",
    "thermodynamic homogeneity is a consequence of invariance of the thermodynamic limit of short - range models with respect to scalings ( contractions and dilatations ) of the phase space .",
    "since the spin - exchange in mean - field models is an extensive variable , it is not  priori evident whether also mean - field models should be thermodynamically homogeneous .",
    "the mean - field thermodynamics is well defined if the thermodynamic limit exists .",
    "mean - field thermodynamic potentials must be thermodynamically homogeneous to make the thermodynamic limit meaningful .",
    "scalings in the phase space of mean - field models are nonlinear transformations due to the volume dependence of the spin exchange , therefore they are replaced by replications of the phase - space variables when testing thermodynamic homogeneity . to introduce real replicas we use an identity for integer  @xmath25 : @xmath26^\\nu = \\text{tr}_\\nu \\exp\\left\\{\\beta\\sum\\limits_{a=1}^{\\nu}h^\\alpha\\right\\ } = \\text{tr}_\\nu \\exp\\left\\{\\beta\\sum\\limits_{a=1}^{\\nu } \\left(\\sum_{i , j } j_{ij}s_i^a s_j^a      + \\sum_i s_i^a\\right)\\right\\}$ ] , where each replicated spin variable @xmath27 is treated independently , i.  e. , the trace operator @xmath28 operates on the @xmath25-times replicated phase space .",

    "this is the eventual situation we would like to achieve also in spin - glass models .",

    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 generate the same macroscopic equilibrium state in thermodynamically homogeneous systems .",
    "thermodynamic homogeneity can be formulated also in the replica trick , where is is equivalent to invariance of the limit of the number of replicas to zero . if the system is thermodynamically homogeneous then the limits @xmath34 and @xmath35 must produce the same results .",
    "we hence can introduce real replicas also in the replica trick to test thermodynamic homogeneity there.@xcite",
    "models with @xmath0 independent spin components have the advantage that they can be treated in the same way as their replicated versions . the only difference is in the number of spin components and the way we perform the trace over spins .",
    "we hence will not specify the trace operator in this section and keep the result valid for all situations of interest .",
    "a mean - field theory is an approximation where the interacting part of the free energy is replaced by purely local terms .",
    "it can be achieved either by a volume - dependent scaling of a long - range exchange as in the sk model or we can consider the limit to infinite dimensions with appropriately rescaled short - range spin exchange in the edwards - anderson model .",
    "the best way to control a mean - field approximation is to employ a perturbation expansion in the spin exchange @xmath17 .",
    "the mean - field contribution is then the leading nonvanishing order in the long - range or infinite - dimensional limit .",

    "it will become evident from the construction that the result at the end will be independent of this artificial chemical potential .",
    "free energy is difficult in that the trace over the spin fluctuations makes an effective potential for the gaussian fields @xmath51 complicated .",
