    "a @xmath1-dimensional lorentz tube ( lt ) is a lorentz gas , in euclidean @xmath1-space , that is confined to a subset @xmath2 which is infinitely extended in one dimension .    as a prototype ,",
    "think of an infinite square - section cylinder in @xmath3 , in whose interior a countable number of convex scatterers are placed approximately with the same density ( see fig .",
    "[ hdtubes_hole ] ) .",
    "a material point travels inertially in the free region of @xmath2 , until it collides with either a scatterer or the boundary of @xmath2 ( from now on , the latter will be referred to as a scatterer as well ) . assuming the scatterer to be infinitely massive , the collision is totally elastic , i.e. , the outgoing velocity @xmath4 is derived from the incoming velocity @xmath5 by reversing the normal component of @xmath5 relative to the plane of collision .",
    "[ hdtubes_hole ]    in the terminology of dynamical systems , a system  like this is an _ extended semi - dispersing billiard_. the term ` extended ' refers to the fact that the configuration space is not compact and the relevant physical measureon it is infinite . also , it is a semi - dispersing billiard  because the particle undergoes a billiard - like dynamics with bouncing walls that are either flat or convex , as seen from the particle .",
    "( we invite the reader to avoid confusion with billiards that are semi - dispersing because the sectional curvature of the scatterers can be either positive or zero ; e.g. , 3d billiards with cylindrical scatterers . )",
    "it is a celebrated fact that semi - dispersing billiards give rise to chaotic dynamics @xcite  using the term ` chaotic ' in a very lax sense here  and so it seems sound to use models like this to study the motion of small particles ( e.g. , electrons ) in thin wires , in whose interior a configuration of obstacles ( e.g. , atomic nuclei ) makes the motion chaotic .",
    "( this was more or less lorentz s original motivation @xcite ; cf .",
    "also @xcite and references therein . )",
    "this note is a follow - up to an article that three of the present authors have published recently @xcite , where these types of systems are studied in two dimensions .",
    "we refer the reader to the introduction of that paper for a better description of the physical and mathematical motivations behind this research .    here",
    "we just outline our main result and its consequences in terms of the stochastic properties of the dynamics we consider .",
    "our chief interest , as far as this note is concerned , is in the recurrence of these types of systems .",
    "recurrence is the most basic property one needs to establish of extended systems in order to study their chaotic properties .",
    "( it is hard to claim that a certain dynamics `` randomizes '' the state of the system  more precisely , decorrelates it from its initial condition  if a non - negliglible part of the phase space is made up of trajectories that escape to infinity , thus giving no asymptotic contribution to the state of the system  in any given compact region . )    in fact , for our lts , we will see below that recurrence is a sufficient condition for a number of stronger ergodic  properties .    for these effectively one - dimensional systems one would expect recurrence to be a typical property . to make this point",
    ", we define a fairly large and representative measured family ( in the language of statistical mechanics , an _ ensemble _ ) of lts and ask if the typical element is recurrent , in the sense of poincar ( which coincides with the intuitive meaning of the word here ) .    the family is defined roughly as follows : the tube @xmath2 is made up of a countable number of congruent @xmath1-dimensional polytopes ( henceforth _ cells _ ) having two parallel and congruent facets ( henceforth _ gates _ ) , whereby each cell is attached to its two adjacent cells ( fig .",
    "[ hdtubes_hole ] is an example of this ) . in each cell",
    "we put a random  configuration of convex scatterers , according to a very general probability  law .",
    "each global realization of scatterers defines a different lt .",
    "this type of structure , in which one randomly chooses a dynamical system  and then follows its deterministic dynamics , is called ` quenched randomdynamical system ' .",
    "so what we have is a _ quenched random  lt_.    if the system  verifies some geometric conditions ( most of which are rather general , some less ) , we prove that almost surely , in the sense of the probability , the lt is recurrent .",
    "since it can be proved that a recurrent lt is also ergodic , and that suitable first - return maps are strongly chaotic ( at least @xmath6-mixing @xcite ) , an important corollary of our work is that the typical lt in our family is chaotic .",
    "as already mentioned , the main contribution of this paper is an extension of the results of @xcite to dimension @xmath7 .",
    "it is known by experts in the field that semi - dispersing billiards in dimension three and higher present specific subtleties and difficulties .",
    "therefore , we made an effort to detail the parts of the proofs that deal with such difficulties , while giving a looser exposition of the remaning arguments ( as they can be found elsewhere as well ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec - pre ] , which should be accessible to the reader with a minimal background in dynamical systems , contains the precise formulation of the results .",
    "section [ sec - sketch ] gives an outline of the main proof , partly referring to previous work by some of the present authors . in section [ sec - detail ] , which is the most technical part of the paper , we give precise proofs for the arguments that are specific to the systems at hand .",

    "whenever there is no risk of ambiguity , we drop the dependence on @xmath42 from all the notation . also , we call _ universal constant _ any bound that depends on none of the quantities explictly or implicitly involved in the inequality at hand , in particular on @xmath25",

    "@xmath25 and all @xmath62 , there is a non - singular trajectory entering @xmath63 through @xmath64 and leaving it through @xmath65 .",
    "the next and last assumption has to do with the well - known fact that a semi - dispersing billiard  is a discontinuous ( and indeed singular ) dynamical system .",
    "it will be formulated in full mathematical rigor in section [ sec - detail ] , after the necessary definitions are given . here",
    "we give a descriptive version which will be quickly understood by the `` hyperbolic  billiardist '' .",

    "it is apparent that , if the lt @xmath25 is recurrent , the first - return map onto @xmath78 is well - defined almost everywhere w.r.t .  the natural measure  on @xmath78 ( see below ) : we call this map @xmath79 .",

    "an important result is the following :    [ thm - erg ] if the lt @xmath25 is recurrent , then @xmath85 is ergodic .",
    "also , for any choice of @xmath76 as described above , @xmath87 is k - mixing ( thus mixing and ergodic ) .    combining theorems [ thm - main ] and [ thm - erg ] ,",

    "the proofs of theorems [ thm - main ] and [ thm - erg ] follows exactly the same strategy as the corresponding proofs in @xcite . for the convenience of the reader ,",
    "though , we are going to outline them in this section , with particular regard to theorem [ thm - main ] .",
    "some of the intermediate results will present complications due to the higher - dimensional setting .",
    "we will explain how to prove these results in closer detail in section  [ sec - detail ] .",
    "the reader is warned that there are a few changes of notation compared to @xcite .",
    "the first step of the proof of theorem [ thm - main ] consists in showing the hyperbolic  properties of _ each _ dynamical system  in the ensemble .",
    "so , for the time being , we fix @xmath45 and describe the lt @xmath25 by means of a certain poincar map which we introduce momentarily . for @xmath12 , denote by @xmath89 the collection of all the _ dispersing _ pieces of boundary in the cell @xmath14 ( it is important that @xmath90 be a whole ssav among those mentioned in ( a2 ) , and not just a portion of it ) . from our hypotheses , @xmath91 is bounded above by the universal constant @xmath92 .",
    "henceforth , we will indicate the index @xmath93 with the symbol @xmath94 , and the space of all such indices with @xmath95 .",
    "evidently , @xmath95 is countable . for @xmath96 , define @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 is the universal constant that appears in ( a4 ) .",
    "( again , @xmath100 is the inner unit normal to @xmath51 at the point @xmath50 . )",
    "all the above definitions clearly depend on @xmath25 : let us now reinstate this dependance in the notation and denote @xmath101 . by ( a4 ) , @xmath102 is a global cross - section for the flow @xmath103 .",
    "we call @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , its poincar map and the invariant measure  induced by the liouville measure  @xmath40 on @xmath102 ( of course , up to a constant factor , @xmath105 has the same density as the measure  @xmath80 introduced in section [ sec - pre ] ) .",
    "each dynamical system  thus defined possesses some basic hyperbolicand ergodic  properties which we now outline , in a rather undetailed way .",
    "[ thm - ltl ] the following holds for the dynamical system  @xmath106 :    * the system  is uniformly hyperbolic  w.r.t .",
    "the natural metric in @xmath102 .",
    "* there is a hyperbolic  structure , in the sense that there exists local stable and unstable manifolds ( lsums ) at a.e .",
    "point of @xmath102 . also , the two corresponding ( invariant ) foliations , when measured with a lebesgue - equivalent @xmath107-dimensional measure , are absolutely continuous relative to @xmath105 . * local ergodicity holds .",
    "this means that , for each @xmath94 , a.a .",
    "pairs of points in @xmath108 are connected by a chain of alternating lsums that intersect transversally .",
    "the intersection points can be chosen out of a predetermined full - measure  subset of @xmath108 .    in the second step of the proof",
    "we represent the lt @xmath25 in yet another way , which will be more convenient later on .",
    "what we do is , we introduce a different cross section for the same flow . for @xmath12 and @xmath109 , denote by @xmath110 the two _ gates _ to the cell @xmath14 and by @xmath111 be the inner normal to @xmath112 , relative to @xmath14 ( thus @xmath113 ) .",
    "consider @xmath114 that is , the collection of ( almost ) all line elements entering @xmath14 from the `` left '' or from the `` right '' , depending on @xmath115 .",
    "the global cross section that we use this time is @xmath116 while the corresponding poincar map we denote @xmath117 .",
    "the gates are sometimes referred to as _ transparent walls _ , because , in the theory of billiards , the corresponding map has virtually the same properties as an ordinary billiard  map , such as @xmath79 or @xmath104 . in particular , it preserves a measure  @xmath118 that has the same functional form as the measures @xmath80 and @xmath105 .",
    "we end up with the triple @xmath119 .",
    "notice that neither the phase space nor the measure  depend on @xmath25 , which is precisely what makes this dynamical system  more convenient than the one previously introduced ( and gives further justification as to why the whole ensemble is called ` quenched random  dynamical system ' : we have a family of maps that are defined on the same space and preserve the same measure ) .",
    "at this point , one might ask why the map @xmath104 was defined at all .",
    "the reason is , we needed to prove theorem [ thm - ltl ] first , in order to obtain the corresponding results for @xmath119 .",
    "in fact , it is not hard to verify that the latter system  inherits the hyperbolic  structure of the former : one constructs the local stable manifolds ( lsms ) and local unstable manifolds ( lums ) of @xmath120 as push - forwards , respectively pull - backs , of the lsms and lums of @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "this is possible because the first system  has fewer singular trajectories than the second so , for example , when a lsm of the second system  is pushed forward by the flow , no cuts occur at all positive times  ensuring that the defined push - forward is indeed a lsm .",
    "it is also rather easy to check that uniform hyperbolicity is maintained .",
    "the result that we are mostly interested in , however , is the analog of theorem [ thm - ltl]_(c ) _ :    [ thm - ltl2 ] the dynamical system  @xmath119 is locally ergodic  in the following sense : for any @xmath12 and @xmath121 , a.a .  pairs of points in @xmath122 are connected by a chain of alternating lsums that intersect transversally .",
    "the intersection points can be chosen out of a predetermined full - measure  subset of @xmath122 .    in the third step of the proof we use the so - called ` point of view of the particle ' ( pvp ) .",
    "it consists of a _ finite - measure _ dynamical system  that , together with a suitable observable , describes the dynamics of _ all _ the s in _ all _ the realizations of the lt .",
    "the idea is that , instead of following a given   from one cell to another , with every iteration of the dynamics we shift the lt in the direction opposite to the  s displacement , so that the point always lands in the same cell ( conventionally @xmath63 ) .",
    "we briefly outline the construction of this dynamical system , referring the reader to @xcite for more detailed explanations .",
    "let @xmath123 be the cross - section corresponding to the gates of @xmath63 , and @xmath124 the normalized billiard  measure  on it .",

    "trace the forward trajectory of @xmath127 until it crosses @xmath9 or @xmath10 for the first time ( almost all trajectories do ) .",
    "this occurs at a point @xmath128 with velocity @xmath129 .",

    "now , tolerating the abuse of notation whereby @xmath154 , let us think of the exit function  @xmath155 as an integer - valued observable of the dynamical system  just defined .",

    "since @xmath155 is bounded and has zero average ( this is clear by time - reversal symmetry ) , in order to derive theorem [ thm - main ] from proposition [ prop - rec ] , what remains to be shown is :    [ thm - pvp",

    "theorem [ thm - ltl]_(c ) _ ) is not known for general semi - dispersing tables , even in finite measure .",

    "@xcite .    for @xmath75 ,",
    "a complication arises that is sometimes referred to as the problem of _ astigmatism _ @xcite .",
    "it turns out that dispersing beams of trajectories that collide with a scatterer almost tangentially ( these are usually called _ grazing beams _ ) do not acquire much additional dispersion .",
    "this problem is circumvented if one prescribes that , a positive percentage of the time , any given trajectory undergoes a dispersing collision that has a non - negligible head - on component @xcite .",
    "assumption ( a4 ) guarantees this .",
    "in fact , @xmath182 is defined as the cross - section of all line elements on a dispersing boundary whose outgoing velocity has a sufficiently large component along the normal vector to the boundary .",
    "@xmath182 is thus a global cross section , with corresponding map @xmath183 .",
    "the same assumption also guarantees that , after @xmath60 returns to @xmath182 , a trajectory has traveled at least a distance @xmath59 , and thus ( by ( a3 ) as well ) has acquired enough hyperbolicity , relative to the so - called orthogonal jacobi metric in tangent space @xcite .",
    "but , on @xmath182 , because of the inequality in ( [ def - malpha ] ) , this metric is equivalent to the natural riemannian metric .",
    "therefore @xmath184 is uniformly hyperbolic . but",
    "this implies the same for @xmath183 , since the orthogonal jacobi metric is non - decreasing for tangent vectors corresponding to dispersing beams .    in order to give a rigorous formulation of assumption ( a6 ) and explain how it is used in the proof of theorem [ thm - ltl]_(b )",
    "_ , we need to lay out some facts and a bit of extra notation .",
    "it is common knowledge that billiard  maps such as @xmath183 are discontinuous .",
    "if @xmath185 is the initial condition of a singular trajectory that has a tangential collision or hits an edge before the next return to @xmath182 , then quite generally @xmath139 is a discontinuity point of @xmath183 .",
    "we call such @xmath139 a _ singular point _ for the map @xmath183 .",
    "( if @xmath139 is singular because of a tangential collision , it can be seen that the differential of @xmath183 blows up at @xmath139 , whence the term ` singular ' . )    in our case , given the peculiar choice of @xmath182 , cf.([def - malpha ] ) , we must consider as singular also those trajectories which , after a collision , have a velocity @xmath186 such that @xmath187 the corresponding line element @xmath138 is clearly a discontinuity point for the poincar map of @xmath182 .",
    "let @xmath188 denote the set of all singular points of @xmath183 and define @xmath189 .",
    "it is a well - known and easily derivable fact that @xmath190 is decomposed into smooth portions of codimension - one manifolds , each of which corresponds to a source of singularity ( a tangential scattering , an edge , or condition ( [ extra - si ] ) ) encountered before or at the next return to @xmath182 ; and to the _ itinerary _ of scatterers visited before that . by ( a2 ) and ( a4 ) , the number of scatterers ( and thus number of edges ) that can be visited before the next return to @xmath182 is bounded by a universal constant . therefore the number of smooth pieces that @xmath190 comprises is also bounded by a universal constant .",
    "moreover , since the lt is algebraic in the sense of ( a2 ) , an easy adaptation of the results of @xcite implies that @xmath190 is actually a finite union of ssavs , whose number is universally bounded .",
    "( the proof of the algebraicity of the singularity set , in @xcite , does not use in an essential way that the scatterer configuration is periodic there . )",

    "it is not hard to generate examples of lts satisfying ( a6 ) .",
    "for example , one can start with a periodic algebraic lt and then perform a ( quenched random ) _ algebraic perturbation_. by this we mean that the equations of the perturbed scatterers are polynomials whose coefficients are very close to the corresponding coefficients for the unperturbed cell .",
    "another easy example is the case where @xmath22 is finite . in that case , say that @xmath199 is contained in the cell @xmath14 .",
    "then , by ( a4 ) , @xmath190 is completely determined by the local configurations in the cells @xmath200 , with @xmath201 ( @xmath202 being a universal constant ) .",
    "but there are only finitely many possibilities for these local configurations , therefore ( a6 ) is implied by ( [ hd-10 ] ) .    the argument that proves theorem [ thm - ltl]_(b ) _ is virtually the same as in lem",

    "in this appendix we present an example of a three - dimensional lt that verifies all the assumptions of section [ sec - pre ] .",
    "we begin by constructing a template cell with its set of scatterers .",
    "then we check that the geometric assumptions ( a2)-(a4 ) hold for this cell .",
    "finally , we specify how to use that to construct a quenched random  lt that verifies all assumptions .",
    "the cell is a rectangular parallelepiped with a square base of side length 1 and with height @xmath232 . for the sake of the description , we embed this solid in the @xmath233-space : the square base lies in the @xmath234-plane , so that the edges of length @xmath235 are in the @xmath139-direction .",
    "we call the @xmath139-direction ` longitudinal ' and any direction orthogonal to it ` transversal ' .    puncture each square facet with a square hole of side @xmath236 , centered in the center of the facet .",
    "these holes take the role of the gates @xmath64 .",
    "populate the cell with the following scatterers : for each of the four edges of length @xmath235 , consider the cylinder of radius @xmath237 which has that edge as its axis .",
    "choose @xmath238 , so that the cylinders do not obscure the gates and intersect each other with a positive angle ( fig .",
    "[ ex_fig ] ) .",
    "the portions of the cylinders that are inside the cell are morally our scatterers . however , in order to satisfy assumption ( a3 ) , we modify these quarter - cylinders by adding a small positive curvature along the longitudinal direction .",
    "we do so in a way that in every transversal section we still have four quarter - circles whose radii satisfy the inequalities given earlier  in other words , we have a so - called _ diamond billiard _ ; cf.fig .",
    "for lack of a better name , we call the resulting solids ` cigars ' .          moreover , we insert a ` bulkhead ' in the middle of the cell , that is , we add an infinitesimally thin scatterer given by the intersection of the plane passing through the center of the cell and orthogonal to the vector @xmath239 , and the cell itself .",
    "we punch an off - center , small , polygonal hole through the bulkhead , so that it is possible to go from one `` chamber '' to the other , but no free ( i.e. , collisionless ) trajectories exist between the two gates of the cell .",
    "notice that by choosing the parameter @xmath235 large enough , we can ensure that the maximum number of consecutive collisions between the flat facets and the bulkhead is 3 .",
    "next , we argue that this setting verifies ( a4 ) .",
    "we say that a trajectory that hits a scatterer almost tangentially _ grazes _ it .",
    "so consider a trajectory that grazes a cigar . if this trajectory has a sizable transversal component ( compared to the longitudinal one ) then its projection on a transversal section is not far from a grazing   in a diamond billiard , which implies that the next bounce is not grazing .",
    "let us hence consider grazing trajectories that are almost longitudinal .",
    "in this case , within a certain ( bounded above ) time , the point will hit the bulkhead in such a way that the next collision is necessarily non - grazing and against a cigar , provided @xmath235 is not too small . on the other hand , since the `` transversal angle '' at each intersection point of two cigars is bounded below , no more that a bounded number of collisions can be performed in said time .",
    "these arguments will be made more quantitative below .    finally , the full lt is made up of random  algebraic perturbations ( in the sense of section [ sec - detail ] ) of this local configuration . if the perturbations are i.i.d .  in each cell , ( a1 )",
    "is obviously verified .",
    "if they are sufficiently small , ( a6 ) holds . as for ( a5 ) , it is not hard to see ( by ergodicity of the inner dynamics in a cell , if one will ) that this assumption is verified as well .          at the request of an anonymous referee , we give estimates for the universal constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 for this lt .",
    "we begin by considering a periodic tube made up of template cells that  contrary to what we have imposed earlier  have no longitudinal curvature .",
    "so the dispersing scatterers are truly cylindrical and , if we neglect the bulkheads , describe the same diamond in each transversal section ( fig .",
    "[ sect ] ) . call @xmath240 the angle at each vertex of the diamond ( so @xmath241 ) .",
    "fix @xmath242 , say , and @xmath243 .",
    "denote by @xmath244 and @xmath245 , respectively , the longitudinal and trasversal components of the velocity @xmath186 of the material point ( thus , @xmath246 ) .",
    "the longitudinal projection of a piece of trajectory that does not hit a bulkhead is a ( planar ) trajectory of the diamond billiard .",
    "consider a collision against a cylinder ( for the 3d billiard ) with outgoing velocity @xmath186 . denoting by @xmath247 the angle of incidence of @xmath186 w.r.t .",
    "the normal at the collision point and by @xmath248 the corresponing angle for the projected trajectory , we have @xmath249 .",
    "let us make a couple of observations on the dynamics in the diamond billiard . to start with , we subdivide its boundary in 4 ` zones ' , each zone being defined as the set of all the boundary points that are closer to a given vertex than to any other ( see fig .  [ sect ] ) .",
    "let @xmath250 , i.e. , @xmath251 is the minimum integer @xmath252 .",
    "it can be seen that any trajectory in the diamond can have at most @xmath251 consecutive collisions in the same zone , and at least one of them will have an angle of incidence @xmath253 ( to see this , just `` linearize '' the corners ) .",
    "also , the time between the first collision in a zone and the first collision in another is bounded below by @xmath254 ( this is the semilength of the biggest square inscribed in the diamond ) .",
    "coming to three - dimensional trajectories , we distinguish two cases : the trajectories with a good transversal component , defined by @xmath255 , and the other ones , which we call almost longitudinal . starting with either case , we want to find an upper bound for the time before the next `` head - on '' collision  the parameter @xmath99 that defines `` head - on '' , cf .",
    "( a4 ) , will de determined later . by time - reversibility , twice this upper bound will be a good estimate for @xmath59 .",
    "if a trajectory keeps a good transversal component during its entire visit in a single zone , we know from above that there will be a collision with angle of incidence @xmath256 , in a time less than @xmath257 ( @xmath258 is an estimate for the horizon of our billiard ) .",
    "if not , we eventually fall in the next case , which we consider right away .",
    "an almost longitudinal trajectory will remain such until it hits a bulkhead , and this occurs necessarily within a time @xmath259 .",
    "the next collision after that , given the inclination of the bulkhead and that @xmath242 , is against a cylinder , with @xmath260 .",
    "so , @xmath59 can chosen to be @xmath261 .",
    "during this time , the point can visit at most @xmath262 zones , therefore an upper bound for the number of collisions it can have is @xmath263 ( the first term estimates the collisions against the cylinders and the second term the collisions against the flat boundaries ) .",
    "we treat the original lt as a perturbation of the one just considered .",
    "if the radius of curvature of the cigars in the longitudinal direction is , say , larger than @xmath264 , multiplying the above estimates by 100 will certainly work .",
