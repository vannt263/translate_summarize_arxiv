    "understanding of the formation and the evolution of molecular clouds ( mc ) is of key significance in the theory of star formation . the early mc evolution , prior to subsequent processes of active star formation , allows for simplified physical modelling due to lack of feedback from the emerging stars . recent numerical simulations shed light on this epoch @xcite .",
    "its characteristic stages could be summarized as follows : i ) convergent flows in the warm neutral medium lead to local compressions and non - linear instabilities ; ii ) turbulent domains ( clouds ) of cold molecular gas form in the dense regions ; iii ) self - gravity in the cloud takes slowly over and local sites of gravitational collapse emerge ; iv ) global contraction of the cloud starts ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",

    "stars begin to form at stage iii ) of the mc evolution , as compressed cloud regions ( usually labelled ` clumps ' ) evolve and fragment to ( prestellar ) cores of typical size @xmath4  pc and densities @xmath5  @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "therefore the core mass function ( cmf ) is considered as a clue to the long - standing problem of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and its variations in different environments and star formation regions .",
    "indeed , the correspondence between the cmf and the imf is well established from dust continuum observations of nearby mcs and mc complexes . @xcite and @xcite derive cmfs that could be fitted by a single power - law function of slopes from -1.1 to -1.6 in the mass range @xmath7 , in agreement with the salpeter high - mass slope of the imf @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "other authors argue for a lognormal @xcite or a two power - law shape of the cmf that mimics the imf even better @xcite .",
    "their results are confirmed by @xcite who used a more reliable approach to obtain core masses from dust extinction measurements toward stellar background .",
    "the cmf in the pipe nebula derived by them is very similar to the imf but shifted to larger masses by a factor of 4  it appears that there is one - to - one correspondence between stars and prestellar cores , assuming star - formation efficiency ( sfe ) of @xmath9 25% .",
    "thus the above - mentioned works suggest that the distinct dense cores are direct progenitors of stars and that the imf and its characteristic mass are determined by turbulent fragmentation processes in mcs and their fundamental physics @xcite .",
    "the potential caveats of this approach are discussed by @xcite .",
    "however , the origin of the cmf from the mass distribution of the initially formed mc clumps is an issue that still needs further elucidation .",
    "the clump mass function ( clmf ) derived from co maps exhibits significantly shallower slope @xmath10 than the imf and lacks a characteristic mass @xcite in contrast to the characteristic mass @xmath11 of the imf . later observational studies allowed for more detailed mapping of mcs .",
    "emission from co molecules was found to trace lower density cloud regions .",
    "the use of other tracers like c@xmath12o and @xmath13co revealed structures with @xmath14  @xmath6  but essentially larger ( @xmath15  pc ) than prestellar cores  @xcite .",
    "such compact clumps ( ` dense mc cores ' ) encompass about 10% of the cloud mass .",
    "the derived clmfs could be represented by a single power - law or a combination of 2 or 3 power - law functions , with a steeper high - mass tail in comparison to the imf .",
    "numerical simulations of clump / core formation caused by supersonic turbulent fragmentation yield a clmf / cmf characterized by a continuum of slopes , with a high - mass tail steeper than @xmath8 @xcite .",

    "the type of the applied turbulent forcing plays also important role .",
    "compressive forcing produces a shallower high - mass part of the clump / core mass distribution compared to the solenoidal regime @xcite .",

    "similar behaviour is found by @xcite from extensive statistics of nearby star - forming regions although these authors obtain essentially steeper slope ( @xmath168 ) for @xmath169 .",
    "the case @xmath149 yields a combination of positive and flat slopes which could be considered also as a single flat intermediate - mass clmf ( fig .",

    ".  [ fig_m - l_pan ] ( right bottom ) shows that the corresponding mass ranges are @xmath172 and overlap partially with the mass range of the study of @xcite . to sum up",
    ", the best agreement between clmfs and observational cmfs is apparently achieved in cases @xmath73 ( @xmath167 ) and @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) which is confirmed also by comparison on size - mass diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig_l - m_pan ] ) .",
    "since @xcite derived cmfs of single clouds , we may speculate that a result from a statistical approach , combining data from more clouds , could be a two- or three power - law cmf . in that aspect ,",
    "the work of @xcite is instructive although we still lack an explanation of the steep slopes they derived for @xmath169 .",
    "their study encompasses objects of sizes , corresponding to our clumps ( @xmath173  pc ) , but the variety of their dynamical state is huge : starless , star - forming and cluster - forming cores . in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will address the problem , comparing the predictions of our model for chosen equipartition relation with cmfs derived from molecular - line and dust - continuum data for several galactic mcs , reflecting various physical conditions . within this work ,",
    "we simply point out that different models of cloud structure consistent with the study of @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mcs_kvar_pan ] ; cf . also fig . 1 in paper i ) lead to clmfs which are in a good general agreement with some observational cmfs ( fig .  [ fig_cmf_obs ] ) .",
    "we obtain quasi - lognormal shapes of the high - mass clmf only by restricting the upper scale @xmath157 of the hierarchy of clumps to very small values ( fig .",
    "[ fig_cmf_li_var ] ) .",
    "that result seems to contradict the mass distributions of cores / clumps obtained from numerical simulations of turbulent fragmentation for various different rms mach numbers @xcite and choices of turbulent forcing @xcite .",
    "however , self - gravity is not included in those simulations while it is a main factor in our approach to derive clmf from energy equipartition relations . as already commented above",
    ", a single power - law high - mass clmf is a universal feature , resulting from the balance between the gravitational and ( mainly ) turbulent energy in clumps .",
    "core mass distributions of lognormal shapes and with large widths were derived as well by @xcite from simulations , that include self - gravity .",
    "we believe their results are different because their objects are more compact and probably more evolved in comparison with the clumps in our consideration .    our discussion does not include cases with high turbulent forcing parameter ( @xmath174 ) where the compressive mode provides the main contribution to the turbulent energy @xcite .",
    "our approach is limited in that aspect since the increase of the stddev of the density distribution ( equation [ eq_sigma_pdf ] ) often yields unrealistically high typical clump masses @xmath154 in relation to the mass included within the volume of a given scale @xmath175 . that constrains the spatial range for a plausible derivation of the clmf .",
    "such solutions are obtained only for low @xmath176 and do not differ significantly from those derived for @xmath151 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_cmf_pan ] , upper panels ) : single power - low with slope about @xmath177 .",
    "nevertheless , the studied cases for @xmath151 are representative enough for the effect of the compressive mode on the clmf .",
    "by use of a statistical approach , we derived mass functions of condensations ( clumps ) which were formed through a turbulent cascade over a range of spatial scales @xmath0  pc during the early mc evolution .",
    "clumps are considered within the framework of paper i : as ensembles of objects in a state of equipartition between gravity and other forms of energy and obeying a power - law mass - density relationship @xmath178 .",
    "the functional form @xmath179 is determined by the chosen equipartition relation and the free parameters of the model : velocity scaling index @xmath180 and turbulent forcing parameter @xmath181 .",
    "the clump mass distribution at a fixed scale was obtained from the assumed lognormal density distribution and then the composite clump mass function ( clmf ) was derived by superposition of the clump mass distributions generated at the various different scales , assuming self - similar cloud structure .",
    "the obtained clmfs for different equipartition relations could be represented by series of power - law functions as intermediate - mass and high - mass parts are distinguished , with a characteristic mass @xmath124 that varies from a few to a few hundred @xmath139 .",
    "the high - mass clmf can be fitted by a power - law of average slope @xmath3 , typical for fractal clouds @xcite , with some variations ( @xmath182 ) when magnetic energy is included in the energy balance of the clumps . when derived from a ` virial - like ' equipartition without ( @xmath136 ) or with accounting for the thermal component of the velocity ( @xmath137 ) ,",
    "the intermediate - mass clmf could be represented by a single power - law of slope @xmath183 , in agreement with some observational clump mass functions ( cmfs ) .",
    "increase of the contribution of turbulent ( @xmath140 ) or magnetic energy ( @xmath149 ) against gravity in the clump energy balance leads to an intermediate - mass clmf which is a combination of two power - laws , except in the case of large velocity scaling index ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "the slope of the steeper part varies in a narrow range @xmath185 depending on the adopted equipartition .",
    "the other power law tends to flatten in case of purely solenoidal turbulent forcing ( @xmath147 ) and even has a positive slope when the equipartition @xmath141 is adopted .",
    "careful comparison with observationally derived mass functions of clumps , considerably larger than low - mass prestellar cores , would demonstrate the ability of our model to match the variety of physical conditions in galactic star - forming clouds .",
