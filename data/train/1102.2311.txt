    "the distant tully - fisher relation ( tfr ) has been extensively studied over the past two decades .",
    "one of its most intriguing property is that it shows a significantly larger scatter at high redshift compared to the local universe .",
    "this effect is seen both in b - band and in k - band ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , which indicates that it is not related to dust or stellar population effects .",
    "integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) now allows us to study the spatially - resolved kinematics of distant galaxies .",
    "first studies of the distant tfr using ifs revealed a correlation between the scatter of the k - band tfr at z@xmath00.6 and the dynamical state of galaxies , meaning that the larger the scatter in the tfr , the larger the dynamical disturbances observed in the galaxy kinematics @xcite .",
    "it was shown that once reduced to rotating disks , the z@xmath00.6 k - band tfr has the same scatter that the local relation , which indicates that the scatter in the distant tfr is indeed entirely due to kinematic disturbances , strong enough to destroy rotation on large spatial scales .",
    "this led @xcite to suggest that major mergers are the physical driver for such kinematic disturbances in a large fraction of z@xmath00.6 galaxies ( see also @xcite from a morphological point of view ) .",
    "interestingly , a new kinematic tracer called @xmath1 was proposed by @xcite .",
    "this tracer combines both the rotation velocity and the velocity dispersion , which makes it a tracer of the total kinematic energy .",
    "@xcite showed that , when applied to the tfr , one gets a new relation ( hereafter @xmath1-tfr ) , on which the scatter is significantly reduced compared to the `` regular '' tfr ( i.e. , when the rotation velocity only is considered ) .",
    "@xcite used hydrodynamical simulations to suggest that such an effect on the scatter could result from shocks in the gaseous phase during galaxy major mergers .",
    "these shocks would lead to a transfer of energy from bulk motions ( i.e. , large - scale rotation ) to random motions , occuring at smaller spatial scales .",
    "this transfer of energy translates into a drop in the rotation velocity as a function of time while the velocity dispersion increases , which results in @xmath1 staying constant at first order .",
    "this would explain why the @xmath1-tfr shows a much reduced scatter compared to the regular tfr .",
    "we studied both the stellar - mass ( smtfr ) and @xmath1-tfr in the images sample .",
    "the images sample is a representative sample of 63 m * emission line galaxies selected in four different fields of view ( i.e. , cfrs03 , cfrs22 , hdfs , and cdfs , see @xcite ) .",
    "all galaxies were observed using the flames / giraffe ifus , which allowed us to map their kinematics at relatively large spatial scales ( @xmath03.5 kpc / pix at z@xmath00.6 ) .",
    "we derived the rotation velocities using monte - carlo simulations , taking carefully into account beam smearing effects @xcite .",
    "stellar masses were obtained from ( dust and inclination corrected ) k - band luminosities and b - v colors using the @xcite simplified prescriptions .",
    "we assumed a diet salpeter imf , which , in combination to the @xcite prescriptions for stellar masses , has the interesting property of maximizing the stellar mass estimates , meaning that any other combination of stellar population model and imf would lead to smaller masses @xcite .",
    "this means that any shift obtained with this combination between the distant and local relation would be larger with any other combination .",
    "the derived smtfr at z@xmath00.6 is shown on the left panel of fig .",
    "1 . it confirms the results of @xcite , that the entire scatter of the distant relation is due to dynamically non - relaxed galaxies .",
    "once reduced to rotating disks , the smtfr is shifted downward by 0.34@xmath2 dex ( where the quoted errobars represent systematic uncertainties ) compared to the local relation , which suggests that intermediate - mass , emission line rotating disks grew up by a factor @xmath02 in stellar mass over the past 6 gyr .",
    "this shift is robust against both random and systematic uncertainties ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "similar results were obtained at z@xmath02.2 in the sins survey : @xcite found a z@xmath02.2 relation shifted downward by 0.41 dex compared to the location relation . at first sight , it might however be surprising to find a similar shift at z@xmath00.6 and z@xmath02 compared to the local relation .",
    "we showed in @xcite that this is linked to the local sample used to derive the shift in zero point .",
    "several widely used local comparison samples were indeed compared in @xcite , where it was shown that the @xcite ursa major sample is biased towards low - mass galaxies , when compared to the local velocity function .",
    "other samples , e.g. , the @xcite sample drawn from the ugc catalog or the @xcite drawn from the sdss , appear to more appropriate when one compares representative samples at different redshifts . in the images survey",
    ", we used the sdss sample as a reference , while the sins survey relied on the @xcite local smtfr , which was drawn from the @xcite sample .",
    "if one re - derives the shift between the z@xmath02.2 smtfr and the sdss smtfr relation , the resulting offset increases from @xmath00.4 to @xmath00.6 dex , i.e. , significantly larger than the shift of 0.36 dex found between the z@xmath00.6 smtfr and the local relation . when comparing the tfr between different redhifts , it is therefore very important to adopt representative samples , or at least samples which share the same properties in terms of mass and/or velocity distribution",
    ".    we also derived the @xmath1-tfr in the images sample ( see middle panel of fig .  1 ) , and confirms the results of @xcite , i.e. , the scatter is reduced by a factor @xmath02 compared to the regular smtfr .",
    "we also found observational evidence for the transfer of energy suggest by @xcite .",
    "one of the object in the images sample was indeed found to be caracteristic of the shrinking effect in the scatter due to the use of @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) : it was modeled in detail using hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite , who found that the best model for this object corresponds to a 3:1 major merger .",
    "we estimate gas masses in the images sample by inverting the schmidt - kennicutt law between star formation rate and gas mass densities @xcite .",
    "total sfrs were estimated by summing contributions from the uv and the ir , while total gas radii were estimated using giraffe - ifu [ oii ] maps carefully deconvolved from beam smearing effects ( see @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the ionized gaz radius is found to be on average @xmath030% more extended than the total uv radius , which suggests that another physical process than radiation from ob stars is ionizing gaz at large radii .",
    "we found observational evidence that shocks during major mergers could be this alternative driver @xcite .",
    "such a process could also be responsible for the increased velocity dispersion observed in z@xmath00.6 disks compared to local ones @xcite , as also observed in higher - redshif disks @xcite .",
    "galaxies at z@xmath00.6 show a median gas fraction of @xmath031@xmath31% .",
    "the same mean gas fraction was estimated independantly by @xcite relying on the evolution of the mass - metallicity relation combined with a closed - box chemical model .",
    "this suggests that systematic effects are probably limited and gives us some confidence in the estimated mass of gas in z@xmath00.6 galaxies .    the resulting baryonic tfr ( btfr ) is shown on the right panel of fig .  1",
    "this is the first time that the btfr is derived at high redshifts . on overall",
    ", it shows the same structure that the smtfr .",
    "however , conversely to the smtfr that is shifted downward by a factor @xmath02 in stellar mass , the btfr does not show any evidence for evolution in zero point compared to the local relation .",
    "this indicates that the reservoir of gas that has been converted into stars over the past 6 gyr was already gravitationnally bound to disks at z@xmath00.6 . as a consequence ,",
    "there is no need for external gas accretion , in qualitative agreement with cosmological simulations which predict that cold flows vanish at z@xmath41.5 in massive halos where such galaxies inhabit in @xcite .",
    "this does not mean that there is no gas accrection in these galaxies since within systematic uncertainties , there is room for cold gas accretion at a level of @xmath030% of the local baryonic mass , but there is presently no need for such an accretation , at least from a dynamical point of view .",
