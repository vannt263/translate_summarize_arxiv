    "let @xmath1 be a group and let @xmath2 be a family of subgroups of @xmath1 , that is , a collection of subgroups which is closed under taking subgroups and conjugation by elements of @xmath1 .",
    "a _ classifying space for the family @xmath3 is a @xmath1cw  complex @xmath4 _ with stabilisers in @xmath2 , such that for any subgroup @xmath5 the fixed point set @xmath6 is contractible .",
    "when the family @xmath3 consists of just a trivial subgroup , the classifying space @xmath7 is the universal free @xmath1space @xmath8 , and if @xmath3 consists of all finite subgroups of @xmath1 then @xmath7 is the so - called _ classifying space for proper actions _ ,",
    "commonly denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "recently , much attention has been attracted by the classifying space @xmath10 for the family of all virtually cyclic subgroups .",
    "one reason for studying @xmath10 is its appearance in the formulation of the farrell - jones conjecture concerning algebraic @xmath11- and @xmath12-theory ; see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the classifying space @xmath7 always exists and that it is unique up to a @xmath1homotopy equivalence @xcite .",
    "a concern is to provide specific models that are as  simple \" as possible .",
    "one , widely used , measure of such simplicity is the ( topological ) dimension .",
    "for example , having a low - dimensional model for @xmath10 enables one to better understand its homology that appears in the left - hand side of the assembly map in the formulation of the farrell - jones conjecture .",
    "low - dimensional models for @xmath10 were constructed for many classes of groups including hyperbolic groups @xcite , groups acting properly on @xmath0 spaces @xcite , and many two - dimensional groups @xcite . in all of these constructions",
    "the minimal dimension of @xmath10 is related to the minimal dimension of @xmath13 .",
    "however , the discrepancy between these two may be arbitrarily large @xcite .",
    "finally , it is an open question whether finite - dimensional models for @xmath10 exist for all groups admitting a finite dimensional @xmath13 .",
    "the main purpose of the current article is to construct low - dimensional models for @xmath10 in the case of groups acting properly on systolic complexes .",
    "a simply connected simplicial complex is _ systolic _ if it is a flag complex , and if every embedded cycle of length @xmath14 or @xmath15 has a diagonal .",
    "this condition may be treated as an upper curvature bound , and therefore systolic complexes are also called `` complexes of simplicial non - positive curvature '' .",
    "they were first introduced by chepoi @xcite under the name _ bridged complexes_. their @xmath16skeleta , _ bridged graphs _ , were studied earlier in the frame of metric graph theory @xcite .",
    "januszkiewicz- ' swiatkowski @xcite and haglund @xcite rediscovered , independently , systolic complexes and initiated the exploration of groups acting on them .",
    "since then the theory of automorphisms groups of systolic complexes is a powerful tool for providing examples of groups with often unexpected properties , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "an exotic large - scale geometric feature of systolic complexes is their",
    " asymptotic asphericity \"  asymptotically , they do not contain essential spheres .",
    "such a behaviour is typical for complexes of asymptotic dimension one or two , but systolic complexes exist in arbitrarily high dimensions .",
    "the asphericity property is the crucial phenomenon used in our approach in the current article .",
    "first , we use it to determine the large - scale geometry of the minimal displacement set of a hyperbolic isometry of a systolic complex .",
    "recall that an isometry ( i.e.  a simplicial automorphism ) @xmath17 of a systolic complex @xmath18 is called _ hyperbolic _ if it does not fix any simplex of @xmath18 .",
    "for such an isometry one defines the _ minimal displacement set _",
    "@xmath19 to be the subcomplex of @xmath18 spanned by the vertices which are moved by @xmath17 the minimal combinatorial distance .",
    "the minimal displacement set of a hyperbolic isometry of a uniformly locally finite systolic complex is quasi - isometric to the product @xmath20 of a tree and the line .",
    "this theorem can be viewed as a systolic analogue of the so - called product decomposition theorem for @xmath0 spaces ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem ii.6.8 ) . unlike the @xmath0 case where the splitting is isometric and it is realised within the ambient space , we provide only an abstract quasi - isometric splitting .",
    "this is mainly due to the lack of a good notion of products in the category of simplicial complexes .",
    "however , our theorem may be seen as more restrictive , since in the @xmath0 case instead of a tree one can have an arbitrary @xmath0 space .",
    "this restriction is used to determine the structure of certain groups acting on the minimal displacement set .",
    "if a group @xmath1 acts properly on a systolic complex , then one can easily see that the centraliser of a hyperbolic isometry acts properly on the minimal displacement set .",
    "if the action of @xmath1 is additionally cocompact , i.e.  @xmath1 is a _",
    "systolic group _ ,",
    "theorem a allows us to describe the structure of such centraliser .",
    "this establishes a conjecture by d.  wise ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture 11.6 ) .",
    "the centraliser of an infinite order element in a systolic group is commensurable with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the free group on @xmath23 generators for some @xmath24 .",
    "theorem b extends also some results from @xcite concerning normal subgroups of systolic groups .",
    "theorem a is the key result in our approach to constructing low - dimensional models for @xmath10 for groups acting properly on systolic complexes .",
    "we follow a `` pushout method '' to construct the desired complex using low - dimensional models for @xmath25 . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that if a group acts properly on a @xmath26dimensional systolic complex @xmath18 then the barycentric subdivision of @xmath18 is a model for @xmath25 .",
    "we then follow the strategy of w.  l \" uck @xcite used for constructing models for @xmath10 for @xmath0 groups .",
    "the key point there is , roughly , to determine the structure of the quotient @xmath27 of the normaliser of a hyperbolic isometry @xmath17 . using similar arguments as in the proof of theorem b",
    ", we show that this quotient is locally virtually free .",
    "this is a strong restriction on @xmath27 which leads to better dimension bounds , when compared with the @xmath0 case .",
    "let @xmath1 be a group acting properly on a uniformly locally finite @xmath26dimensional systolic complex .",
    "then there exists a model for @xmath10 of dimension    @xmath28    in section  [ sec : ex ] we provide several classes of examples to which our construction applies .    as a follow - up",
    ", we consider the family @xmath29 of all virtually abelian subgroups . to the best of our knowledge",
    "there have been no known general constructions of low - dimensional classifying spaces for this family , except for cases reducing to studying the family of virtually cyclic groups ( as in the case of hyperbolic groups ) . in the realm of systolic groups we are able to provide such constructions in the full generality .",
    "let @xmath1 be a group acting properly and cocompactly on a @xmath26dimensional systolic complex .",
    "then there exists a model for @xmath30 of dimension @xmath31 .",
    "the most important tool used in the latter construction is the systolic flat torus theorem @xcite . as an immediate consequence of the methods developed for proving theorem d , we obtain the following",
    ".    let @xmath1 be a group acting properly and cocompactly by isometries on a @xmath0 space @xmath18 of topological dimension @xmath32 .",
    "furthermore , assume that for @xmath33 there is no isometric embedding @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the euclidean space .",
    "then there exists a model for @xmath30 of dimension @xmath36 .",

    "classical examples of groups acting properly on systolic complexes are small cancellation groups @xcite .",
    "note that small cancellation groups are not always hyperbolic and only for some of them a @xmath0 structure is provided .",
    "there is a natural construction by d.  wise of a systolic complex associated to a small cancellation complex .",
    "therefore , theorem c and theorem d apply in the small cancellation setting .    in the current article",
    "we explore the more general and more powerful theory of _ graphical small cancellation _ , attributed to gromov @xcite .",
    "furthermore , instead of studying small cancellation presentations , we consider a slightly more general situation of graphical small cancellation complexes and their automorphism groups .",
    "our approach is analogous to the one by mccammond - wise @xcite in the classical small cancellation theory .",
    "we initiate the systematic study of graphical small cancellation complexes , in particular in section  [ sec : graphical ] we prove their basic geometric properties .",
    "the theory of groups acting properly on graphical small cancellation complexes provides a powerful tool for constructing groups with prescribed features .",
    "examples include finitely generated groups containing expanders , and non - exact groups with the haagerup property , both constructed in @xcite .    towards our main application , which is constructing low - dimensional models for classifying spaces",
    ", we define the _ wise complex _ of a graphical small cancellation complex .",
    "it is the nerve of a particular cover of the graphical complex .",
    "we show that the wise complex of a simply connected @xmath38 graphical complex is @xmath39systolic ( theorem  [ t : ss ] ) , and that the two complexes are equivariantly homotopy equivalent in the presence of a group action ( theorem  [ t : ghe ] ) .",
    "the latter result is achieved by the use of an equivariant version of the borsuk nerve theorem , which we prove on the way ( theorem  [ t : nerve ] ) . as a corollary",
    "we obtain the following .",
    "let @xmath1 be a group acting properly and cocompactly on a simply connected @xmath38 graphical complex for @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath1 acts properly and cocompactly on a @xmath39systolic complex , i.e.  @xmath1 is a @xmath39systolic group .",

    "we also recall a general method of constructing classifying spaces for the family of virtually cyclic subgroups developed in @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : minset ] we show that the minimal displacement set of a hyperbolic isometry of a systolic complex splits up to quasi - isometry as a product of a real line and a certain simplicial graph .",
    "section  [ sec : fillingradius ] is devoted to proving that this graph is quasi - isometric to a simplicial tree .",
    "the proof relies on the aforementioned asymptotic asphericity properties of systolic complexes . finally in section  [ sec : mainthm ] , using the method described in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] we construct models for @xmath44 and @xmath30 for groups acting properly on systolic complexes .    in the second part ( sections  [ sec : graphical][sec : dualisisystolic ] ) we study graphical small cancellation theory . in section  [ sec : graphical ] we initiate systematic studies of small cancellation complexes and show their basic geometric properties . in section  [ sec : dualisisystolic ] we prove that the dual complex of a graphical small cancellation complex is systolic .",
