    "because of relativistic beaming , jets greatly outshine their host galaxies thus making blazars unique laboratories for exploring jet structure , physics and origin .",
    "blazars emit strongly from radio through energies .",
    "their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) comprises two major continuum , non - thermal , components @xcite : the first , peaking in the ir - optical - range , is unambiguously identified as synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons .",

    "it is generally modeled as inverse compton ( ic ) scattering by the same electrons that produce the synchrotron emission .",

    "the frequency of the synchrotron peak ( @xmath0 ) has emerged as ( one of ) the most important observational distinction across the blazar family @xcite , leading to the classification of blazars as ` red ' or ` blue ' according to their sed ` color ' , the location of the peak .",
    "@xcite showed that blazar seds seem to change systematically with luminosity ; the most powerful objects are red , while blue seds are associated with relatively weak sources , a result supported by studies of high redshift blazars and of low power bllac objects ( see * ? ? ?",

    "another fundamental distinction among blazars concerns their ` thermal ' spectral properties , where they encompass a wide range of phenomenology , ranging from objects with featureless optical spectra ( bllac objects ) to objects with quasar  like ( broad ) emission line spectra ( flat spectrum radio quasars , fsrq * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "this distinction is likely to have an impact on the mechanisms of production of the component in different types of blazars , with bllacs being consistent with pure ssc , and fsrq with ec .",
    "in fact in most fsrqs the prominence of the thermal components with respect to the synchrotron emission suggests that ec must be dominant over ssc .",
    "the case for bllacs is more ambiguous . since particles in the active region ( blob ) in the jet would see the external radiation greatly amplified by relativistic aberration with respect to what we measure",
    ", the fact that we do not directly detect any thermal component may not necessarily mean that in the jet rest frame its intensity is not competitive with the internally produced synchrotron radiation .",
    "however , the broad band emission of tev detected bllac objects , like , is well modeled with pure ssc and stringent upper limits can be set on the contribution of ec to their seds @xcite .      rapid and large - amplitude variability is a defining observational characteristic of blazars .",
    "it occurs over a wide range of time - scales and across the whole electromagnetic spectrum @xcite .",
    "flux variability is often accompanied by spectral changes , typically more notable at energies around / above the peak of each sed component .",
    "multiwavelength correlated variability studies have been a major component of investigation of blazars , but because of observational limitations so far it has been focused on blue blazars .",
    "blue blazars / hbls indeed constitute a particularly interesting subclass , for their synchrotron emission peaks right in the band , and the high energy component reaches up to tev .",

    "the observed variability on time - scales of hours indicates that light crossing time effects _ within _ the active region are very important and must be dealt with .",
    "there are two main aspects related to photon travel times that are important for an accurate study .",
    "the first , which we can call ` external ' ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is a purely geometric effect that pertains to the impact of the finite size of the active region on the observed variability , namely the delayed arrival time of the emission from different parts of the blob , and consequent smearing of the intrinsic variability characteristics @xcite .",
    "it is relatively simple to implement .",
    "the second effect , internal , pertains to the impact of these same delayed times on the actual physical evolution of the variability ( as opposed to just our ` perception ' of it ) due to the changing conditions inside the active region .",
    "this effect constitutes the real challenge for proper multi - zone modeling . in this respect",
    "the most important issue is that of the photon diffusion across the blob on the electrons inverse compton losses .",
    "proper accounting of this effect is significantly more complex and computationally expensive , and traditionally neglected under the assumption that electron cooling is dominated by synchrotron losses .",
    "this is , however , a strong assumption , rarely valid , as suggested by the observation that the luminosity of the synchrotron components is at best of the same order as the ic component , more commonly lower .",
    "it has long been realized that a simple one - zone homogeneous model is not adequate to describe the temporal evolution of the blazar jets , and that lcte must be taken into account .",
    "@xcite suggested that the observed delay between and infrared variations in 3c273 could be related to the time necessary for the soft ( synchrotron ) photon energy density to build up as the they travel across the active region .",
    "some progress has been made to develop multi - zone models , though with limited success because the traditional analytical approach requires significant assumptions , such as simple geometries or assumptions about the relevance of different physical processes .",
    "the inclusion of just the external lcte is enough to yield new insights on ssc light curves , such as on the way the interplay between cooling / acceleration time - scales and source size affects the observed light curves as a function of energy and combination of the various time - scales @xcite .",
    "in all the cited cases the size of the active region and the duration of the injection of fresh particles are related through @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the radius of a sphere or the length of a cubic region .",
    "the geometry is characterized by a single length - scale .",
    "this kind of models , not accounting for internal lcte and non - locally - emitted radiation for ic emission , could yield correct results for the evolution of the electron distribution if synchrotron losses dominate , however even in this case their results for the evolution of the ic component are not realistic because they ignore the contribution of seed photons from other zones .",
    "@xcite and @xcite were the first to include the internal lcte to calculate the ic spectrum , for both ssc and external ic models .",
    "however , they did not properly account for it when calculating ic energy losses .",
    "their model is thus accurate only when synchrotron losses are dominant .",
    "observationally this corresponds ( approximately ) to cases where the peak of the lower energy component of the sed ( synchrotron ) is significantly brighter than that of the second peak ( ic ) .",
    "@xcite developed a model taking into account all the lctes , but specialized to an elongated ` pipe ' geometry .",
    "the geometry of the current implementation of their code is effectively one - dimensional .",
    "the lack of an actual transverse dimension represents a significant limitation when considering the lcte , considering because of relativistic aberration we are effectively observing a jet ( also ) from its side .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a more general and flexible code to simulate blazar variability , addressing and overcoming most of the limitations affecting previous efforts .",
    "the general features and assumptions of the code are illustrated in section ",
    "[ sec : code ] , followed by a comparison with the results of other codes to test its robustness in  [ sec : tests ] .",
    "in  [ sec : applications ] we present results of a few test cases based on the multiwavelength observations of in march 2001 .",

    "similarly , we do not use primes when the context is clear ( for instance in the discussion of the fokker ",
    "planck equation ) .     ]",
    "our code couples fokker  planck ( f - p ) and monte carlo ( mc ) methods in a 2 dimensional ( cylindrical ) geometry .",
    "it is built on the mc radiative transfer code developed by liang , bttcher and collaborators @xcite , parallelized by @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo method is ideal for multi - zone 2d/3d radiative transfer problems . due to its tracking of the trajectory of every photon , lcte",
    "are automatically accounted for , regardless of the geometry .",
    "we modified the parent code significantly in several aspects , to make it more general applicable , in particular to the physical conditions of the active region in a blazar jet .",
    "the code separates the handling of photon and electron evolution .",
    "the electron evolution is governed by the fokker ",
    "planck equation , as commonly done @xcite .",
    "photons are dealt with by the mc part of the code , which tracks photon production and evolution by different mechanisms , including ic scattering with the current electron population , _ and _ propagation .",
    "the code s basic structure and work flow is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : codeflow ] .",
    "there are two main loop structures .",
    "since the evolution of the electron distribution is faster than that of the photons , each mc cycle contains several f - p ( electron ) cycles .",
    "therefore the code has two main time - steps : a longer mc time - step ( @xmath11 ) , within which the f - p equation routine performs the evolution of the electron spectrum on shorter , variable length , time - steps ( @xmath12 ) . we describe them in more details in the next sections .      as illustrated in fig .",

    "the number of zones sets the resolution of the simulation for what concerns spatial inhomogeneities in the physical properties , either as directly set up or because of their different evolution ( radiation energy density will always develop a radial profile , in turn inducing a radial profile in the electron spectra ) . in the scheme adopted for this work the number of zones",
    "is also related to the duration of the monte carlo time - step ( see  [ sec : code : mc ] ) . for scenarios where",
    "the variability is produced by a perturbation crossing the simulation volume moving along the @xmath14 axis , spatial / temporal resolution in the @xmath14 direction is more important , hence we select a larger @xmath16 . for the simulations presented here",
    "our choice yields a monte carlo time resolution of @xmath19s in the observer s frame , adequate to model the 2001 data .",
    "it is possible to study faster variability , @xmath20 minutes as observed in pks2155@xmath21304 @xcite , by increasing the number of zones at the expense of increased computational time .",
    "it is worth noting that as long as the choice of @xmath15 , @xmath16 ensures that each zone is small enough to sample properly the variations on the physically relevant time - scales , the results of the simulations are substantially insensitive to these parameters .",
    "this geometrical setup is adequate for the case we want to study since the assumption is that the active region is a slice of a collimated jet . in principle , the code setup is flexible enough that slightly different geometries could be simulated via the parameter settings in each zone .",
    "each zone has its own electron population ( spectrum , density ) and magnetic field",
    ". they can be setup individually and their time evolution is independent from each other , except for the effect of mutual illumination .",
    "photons move freely among different zones , but the code assumes that electrons stay in their given zone and do not travel across zones ; the electron larmor radius is very small for the energies and ( tangled ) magnetic field strengths typical for the active region of a blazar jet , at least those studied here .",
    "for instance , for @xmath22 and @xmath23 g , @xmath24 cm , to be compared with source size of the order of @xmath25 cm .",
    "the radiation emitted by the blob is registered in the form of a pseudo - photon list ( see   [ sec : code : mc : mc_particles ] ) , with time , direction and energy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "all the calculations are done in the blob rest frame .",
    "the transformation of all the quantities into the observer s frame is performed afterwards .",
    "the output is analyzed using a separate post processing code to produce seds and light curves .",
    "since the product of the code is effectively a photon list , we have significant freedom in the choices of bin sizes for time , energy , and angle , mostly limited by statistics , much in the same way as for actual observations .",
    "hence , we can tailor the simulation results to the characteristic of the observations that we want to reproduce ( time binning , energy bands ) .    in all cases presented here ,",
    "the observed spectrum is obtained by integrating the beamed photons over a small solid angle centered around the angle @xmath26 between jet axis and observer , assumed as customarily to be @xmath27 , for which also @xmath28 .",

    "the mc part of the code uses the current electron distribution , as updated in the f - p section of the code .",
    "it includes all processes that involves changes in the radiation field , such as compton scattering and the production of new photons by various radiative processes , the most important of which for our case is synchrotron emission .",
    "other notable processes are pair production and annihilation , and synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "the mc time - step is currently a user - set parameter , part of a run input setup .",
    "it is adjusted depending on the geometry of the problem , shorter than the light crossing time of the smallest zone , and requirements of physical accuracy , for instance with respect to the fact that during each mc time - step the code does not change the electron distribution , which is evolved only during the f - p section of the code ( ensuring that @xmath30 for the highest energy electrons . )      since it is impossible to follow every individual photon a common technique used in radiative transfer problems is to group them into packets , pseudo - photons @xcite , to which we will refer as monte carlo particles .",

    "the mc particles are born in the volume through emission processes , primarily synchrotron radiation in our case .",

    "the position within a given zone , time within the current time - step , and travel direction of the mc particle when it is generated are drawn randomly from the appropriate probability distributions .    at every time - step ,",
    "each mc particle moves independently , with some probability of being ic scattered .",
    "absorption is handled as a decrease of the statistical weight of the mc particles .    when a mc particle reaches the volume boundary , it is recorded with the full information of the escape time , position , direction , and energy , forming a list of emitted photons",

    "a major difficulty of using the monte carlo method to model broadband ic emission , in the physical conditions typical of blazar jets , is the low pseudo - photon statistics at high frequencies .",
    "observations are affected by a very similar problem .",

    "when a photon ( for us a mc particle ) is scattered to the tev range , the energy of that mc particle will increase by about 911 orders of magnitude depending on whether it was an or optical photon , and its ` flux ' will decrease by the same factor mc particles in each bin .",

    "an additional challenge that we face is that the ic scattering probability is very small . under most reasonable conditions",
    "the active blob is very optically thin .    in order to mitigate these problems",
    ", we introduced a method relying on the splitting of mc particles .",
    "the basic idea is that since every mc particle represents a packet of real photons treated together , it is always possible to divide them into smaller packets .",
    "if this splitting is applied in appropriate conditions , it is possible to achieve a reasonable statistics on mc particles at high frequencies with reasonable computer resources .",
    "we have implemented mc particle splitting in three different instances within the context of the computation of ic scattering .    1 .",
    "the first splitting is applied to every mc particle when it is considered for ic scattering .",
    "it is split into a large number of identical subparticles ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the choice of this number depends on the trade off between improving the statistics of the high energy photon spectrum and cost in terms of computing resources ( time and memory ) , and it was based on empirical testing . whether a particle is scattered or not is determined by comparing the distance it would travel with a distance to the next scattering stochastically determined from its mean free path .",
    "every mc subparticle draws a separate random number , and in turn has its own probability of being scattered .",
    "all non - scattered mc subparticles are recombined into a mc particle , and travel to a new position .",
    "the subparticles that do scatter ( usually a small number ) will be scattered separately , to independent energies and directions ( but see below ) .",
    "this first splitting does not necessarily save a computational time , but it decreases dramatically the memory allocation requirement to achieve the desired statistics at the highest sed energies .",
    "the second instance of splitting is applied to mc ( sub)particles that are being scattered .",
    "they are divided into another large number ( @xmath78 ) , and each of these mc sub - subparticles will be scattered separately , to a frequency and direction uncorrelated with those of the other particles .",
    "this splitting allows us to concentrate computation cycles on the rare events of scatterings , which is what we are most interested in .",
    "3 .   even with this second splitting , at highest energies",
    "the statistics of the ic photon spectrum remains very poor . to alleviate this problem",
    ", we implemented a third instance of mc particle splitting .",
    "it is triggered when one of the already twice - split mc particles is scattered to very high frequency , above a threshold that is set a priori and constant for each run , tailored to the characteristics of the studied sed .",
    "this mc particle is split again , and each of its subparticles is re - scattered from the original frequency . that scattering is accepted only when the scattered frequency is higher than the preset threshold , otherwise it goes back and draws another random number .",
    "this third splitting offers the benefit of avoiding the use of a much larger number of subparticles in the second instance of splitting , and subsequently avoiding the production of a very large number of mc particles to be recorded in the computer memory .",
    "splitting causes the number of mc particles to grow during the simulation .",
    "nevertheless , the advantage over directly setting up the simulation with more mc particles is significant both in terms of number of mc particles and more importantly because the new mc particles are created where they are most needed , thus increasing greatly the efficiency of the code . in typical",
    "runs the increase in the number of mc particles due to the splitting is modest , of the order of 1020 per cent of the number of newly emitted synchrotron photons at each mc step .",
    "[ sec : code : changes : synchro_and_ic ]    although the f - p equation can calculate the time dependent evolution of the electrons with arbitrary spectrum , earlier versions of the code forced the decomposition of the electron population into a low - energy thermal population plus a high - energy power law tail .",

    "was computed with a single - zone homogeneous ssc model .",
    "the electrons are assumed to be continuously injected and reach a steady state @xcite . for this test , we take the equilibrium electron distribution calculated in the homogeneous code as our input electron distribution , and turn off the f - p evolution of the electrons .",
    "we cut the volume into several identical zones just to make use of the parallel structure of the code .",
    "since the single - zone model uses a spherical geometry , while our mc model uses a cylindrical geometry , we choose to use the same radius ( @xmath79 cm ) , but with the height of the cylinder @xmath80 , in order for the two models to have the same volume .",

    "this may constrain the characteristics of the particle injection , such as their spectrum ( shape and density ) and energy span . on the other hand ,",
    "the time dependent spectral behavior of blazars has led people to speculate that there is more than one component contributing to the blazar emission @xcite .",

    "we mostly focus on the and tev spectra .",
    "these features have been observed in several instances for , mostly cleanly in the case of the 2001 march 19 flare , and the other well studied tev detected blue blazars .",

    "the precise value of @xmath103 is however not well constrained by observations .",
    "the emission by electrons at @xmath111 would be below the optical band , where there is not much simultaneous coverage , and emission by much lower energy electrons would fall in a band ( @xmath112hz ) where observations suggest that the sed is dominated by radiation from other regions of the jet @xcite .",
    "moreover , cooling time - scales for electrons at those energies are long compared with the typical duration high - density multiwavelength campaigns ( see eq.[eq : tau_sync ] ) , making it difficult to set a constraint on @xmath103 based on variability .",
    "higher values of @xmath103 affect the synchrotron emission in the optical band and in turn the ic component , mainly in the gev band , and therefore we can assess their viability with current and future observations .",
    "given that during the 2001 campaign @xcite there seemed to be a modest level of variability in the optical band , @xmath113 , though not directly from observations simultaneous with the march 19 flare , we simulated scenarios where the injected electron population has a relatively low @xmath114 ( table  [ tab : model_parameters ] ) .",
    "we choose to truncate the electron distribution at this value also because the number of low energy electrons grows rapidly , thus increasing significantly the computational time without adding much to the investigation presented here ; as noted , emission from lower energy electrons would not be detectable , and they would not significantly alter the properties of the emission and its variability observed in blue blazars .",
    "this is of course an assumption that is valid for this work but that should be revisited , for instance for the study of red blazars .",
    "the spectral indices of the injected electron distributions @xmath105 or @xmath107 ( @xmath115 as expected for a cooling break ) are mostly constrained by the shape of the synchrotron sed at energies below the optical range .",
    "the preferred value for @xmath116 constitutes a somewhat hard spectrum but it is consistent with values discussed by several particle acceleration studies .",
    "in particular , stochastic ( 2@xmath117-order fermi acceleration ) and acceleration at relativistic shear layers have been suggested to produce very hard ( @xmath118 ) particle spectra @xcite .    in the context of this discussion",
    ", it is worth adding that we considered scenarios with and without a pre - existing population of relativistic electrons or an external ` diluting ' sed ( see  [ sec : applications : standard_case ] and  [ sec : applications : no_bkg_electrons ] for details ) , and their characteristics could be regarded as an additional degree of freedom of our modeling . in this respect , however , while a particular choice of values has some effect on the best parameters for the component responsible for the variability , its effect is fairly limited and the most important point is the existence or not of such secondary component ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "next , we illustrate some general arguments and estimates for values of the fundamental physical parameters . we then present and discuss the results obtained with the set of parameters that we deemed more successful , and in turn ` fit ' the seds and light curves of the 2001 march 19 outburst testing several different parameter combinations , including the possible dilution by emission from a different region of the jet not involved in the flare , and the presence of a pre - existing electron population in the region that becomes active .",
    "key parameters in the modeling of blazars with the ssc model include the lorentz factor , the magnetic field strength , the size of the volume , and the energy of the electrons that are responsible for the synchrotron peak of the sed , @xmath119 .",
    "this latter is associated with a break in the electron distribution or its maximum , depending on the spectral index .",
    "we use the observational results of @xcite as the benchmark of our analysis .",
    "there are several observed features that constrain the value of these parameters ( see previous section ) .",
    "additionally , independent estimates of the relativistic beaming parameters of blazars , from observed superluminal motion as well population statistics , yield lorentz factors of the order of tens @xcite . as we mentioned before",

    "assuming mono - energetic emission the relationship is @xmath123 . for @xmath124kev .",
    "parameterized , for simplicity we left out factors @xmath125 . ] on fiducial values for these three parameters the @xmath119 of the electrons emitting at the synchrotron peak is : @xmath126 if the ic component peak resulted from scattering of photons of the synchrotron peak in thomson regime we could directly infer the energy of the electrons emitting at both sed peaks as @xmath127 with @xmath128 is the peak energy of the ic component .",
    "however , as discussed by ( * ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "11 therein ) , the sed shape and variability time - scale observed in in 2001 favor parameters such that the scattering between electrons at @xmath119 and synchrotron peak photons at @xmath121 would happen in the k - n regime ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this case the ic peak energy would be largely independent of @xmath121 and the expression would instead be : @xmath129    requiring that the condition for thomson regime , @xmath130 ( where @xmath131 ) , holds true for @xmath132 and @xmath133 , one can derive a rough estimate of what ( @xmath7 , @xmath122 ) combination would be necessary to push into the thomson regime the scattering between @xmath119 and its own synchrotron photons , emitted at @xmath121 . @xmath134 as shown by @xcite , it is indeed possible to achieve an acceptable sed fit with high @xmath7 and @xmath122 .",
    "however , while this kind of model matches equally well a static sed , its smaller blob size and extreme lorentz contraction make it implausible when compared with more dynamic observational findings , beginning with the variability time - scales .",
    "the rest frame synchrotron cooling time can be expressed as function of electron energy and the magnetic field : @xmath135 or , more directly related to observables , in terms of observed photon energies : @xmath136 or , in the observer s frame , @xmath137 showing its dependence on the inverse square root of the energy of the observed photons .    a general constraint among the observed variability time - scale and source size and time - scale of the acceleration , injection or cooling process is : @xmath138 as noted in section[sec : code : changes : injection ] , in this work we take a simplified approach , whereby we do not specify the acceleration mechanisms underlying the particle injection , and we choose to link the injection time - scale to the geometry of the source , namely its dimension along the jet axis , @xmath8 .",
    "hence we have a simplified relationship with the observed variability , and considering that the 2001 march 19 flare has a flux doubling and halving time of the order of @xmath139s , we have approximately @xmath140 please note that this constraint could actually vary with the observed band because some time - scales are likely to be energy dependent .    if the ic cooling rate is similar to the synchrotron cooling rate @xmath141 .",
    "the condition @xmath142 translates into @xmath143    from the constraints and relationships illustrated above we infer that a good starting point to model the sed of is a combination of @xmath144 cm , @xmath145 g , @xmath146 , @xmath147 .    because of computational limitations we did not perform an actual fit to identify the best set of parameters values reproducing the sed and the flare evolution properties .",
    "we explored a limited range of values for @xmath2 , @xmath7 , @xmath102 around the values obtained from the above analysis , and focused on changes of the maximum electron energy @xmath104 and the injected power @xmath70 .",

    "the outburst is attributed to the injection into our active volume of a new population of higher energy electrons , with fixed injected spectrum ( power law with exponential cutoff ) .    in this first scenario",
    "the blob is not empty , but it is filled with a ` background ' population of electrons , homogeneous throughout the volume .",

    "4 .   since the active region",
    "was previously filled by a population of electrons emitting a lower luminosity slowly varying sed this scenario easily accounts for the modest variability in the optical band .",
    "while matching the observed spectra is relatively easy , for the spectrum we encountered the usual challenge : the observed spectrum is harder than what predicted by simulations @xcite .    in order to investigate these points in more details , we explored two alternative scenarios , which we discuss in turn below .      with a similar setup we tested a scenario",
    "in which there is no background electron population pre - existing in the blob . the steady broader band emission observed in the optical band",
    "is attributed to a component from a different region in the jet , which we will call ` foreground ' component .",
    "we assume that there is no interaction between the two regions .",
    "the ` foreground ' component is combined a posteriori with the radiation from the flaring blob , simply by adding it as a steady sed to the emission from the time dependent simulation .",
    "a very important difference with respect to the previous case is that photons from this component do not contribute to the ic emission by the freshly injected electron population .",
    "the volume size , geometry and doppler factor of the active blob are the same as for the previous case . because of the lack of extra local seed photons for the ic emission , in order to match the sed , in particular to boost the ic component with respect to the synchrotron one , it is necessary to decrease the magnetic field strength .",
    "the injection of electrons begins at @xmath158s .",
    "the injected distribution has a spectrum with @xmath101 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath168erg / s .",

    "+ the relative length of cooling and geometric time - scales is again an important factor , cleanly shown by the bands . in tev",
    "however this is compounded by the effect of lctes . the first steeper rise ( up to @xmath175ks ) of tev flux",
    "is driven by the increase of electrons as they are injected in the blob by the moving shock combined with the fact that we see a larger and larger fraction of the blob volume , modulated by external lcte ( see  [ sec : applications : geometric_effects ] ) .",
    "this is also signaled by the fact that the knee occurs at around the time when the observer would see the largest section of the blob ( red dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : empty_fg_lc]c ) . the slow rising , flat - top , phase ( @xmath176ks ) of the tev light curve is due to the increase of seed photons available at each location within the blob due to diffusion from the rest of the blob , delayed by internal lcte .",
    "it s a slow rise also because the high energy electrons responsible for most of the ic scattering to the tev band are already cooling rapidly . at some point",
    "the radiation energy density in each location in the blob will stop increasing because enough time has passed for photons to diffuse throughout the blob .",
    "after that time the evolution is simply determined by particle cooling and external lcte . because the electrons emitting the bulk of the observed tev flux have a cooling time larger than @xmath177 , in this case the tev flare decay shape",
    "is determined by cooling rather than lcte .",

    ", the flux - flux amplitude correlation is reproduced only partially .",
    "the trend is almost quadratic during the rising phase of the flare , and it turns to sub - linear on the decaying phase , after a short horizontal shift corresponding to the flat top of the tev light curve .",

    "also in this scenario we have not been able to produce tev spectra as hard as the observations and in the end we limited ourselves to matching the flux level at around 1tev .",
    "some of the differences with respect to the first case are ultimately due to the weaker magnetic field making synchrotron cooling time - scales @xmath178% longer : for the highest energy electrons emitting in and tev @xmath179 becomes longer than @xmath177 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the decrease of @xmath7 is dictated by observational constraints , namely the relative luminosity of the synchrotron and ic components and the need to compensate for the absence of the additional source of seed photons for ic scattering provided in case  1 by the co - located ` background ' component .",
    "this is in fact a good example of how the model is globally constrained .",
    "as we pointed out , in the previous two cases , the simulated sed in the tev range is softer than the observed spectra . to try to improve the match of the tev part of the sed , we considered a modified version of the first scenario .",
    "we increased the lorentz factor ( @xmath180 ) and decreased the magnetic field strength ( @xmath181 g ) , the goal being to move the inverse compton peak to higher energy while leaving the synchrotron peak approximately unchanged .",
    "the parameters are : @xmath182 cm , @xmath183 cm , @xmath181 g , @xmath184 . at @xmath151",
    "the ` background ' electrons have the same broken power law distribution as in the first case , but with lower number density , @xmath185@xmath156 .",
    "the volume is slightly larger yielding a total energy content of @xmath186ergs .",
    "the injected electrons have a power law distribution with @xmath101 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath187erg / s .",
    "injections starts in this case at @xmath188s .",
    "results are integrated over @xmath189 , which corresponds to a doppler factor range @xmath190 .",
    "seds , light curves , and vs. tev flux - flux correlation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bettersed_seds ] , and dcfs in fig .",
    "[ fig : dcf]e , f .",
    "the itemized summary of the main reference observations does not show improvements beyond the slightly higher vhe sed peak .    1 .   because of the larger doppler factor the electron emitting at the sed peaks have lower energy , which combined with a weaker magnetic field results in longer cooling time - scales ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : tau_sync_parameterized ] ) , in turn exceeding the source crossing time .",
    "this has the effect of increasing the asymmetry of the light curves in bands whose emission involves lower energy electrons and/or photons .",
    "the soft and tev light curves indeed have a slowly decaying tail .",
    "2 .   once again during the rising phase of the flare the -correlation is approximately quadratic , until the peak of the light curve . after the tev flare peak",
    "the correlation is approximately linear , as expected when the variation in both bands is driven only by the cooling of the ( same ) electrons , because the ic seed photons are emitted by particles with longer cooling time - scale .",
    "3 .   the results concerning time - lags are equivalent to those of the other scenarios , perhaps with a hint of a smaller lag between tev and softer",
    ". more extensive analysis would be necessary to quantify this possibility .",
    "4 .   the slight shift of the ic peak to higher energy enables a better match with the observed spectra , although the actual spectral indices of the simulated seds remain softer than the observed values .",
    "further increases of the doppler factor can still produce good seds , as long as we concurrently reduce the size of the volume .",
    "however , the light crossing time would rapidly become smaller than the observed flare duration , and it would have minimal impact on the observed phenomenology . therefore the observed flare shapes must represent the true acceleration and cooling of the electrons , and the symmetry of the light curves must be caused by similar heating ( or injection ) and cooling time - scales .",
    "there are complex geometry - related effects that have an impact not only on the shape of the observed light curve ( its symmetry ) , but can also leave an imprint on other observables such as time lags and energy - dependent flare shape . depending on how the particle injection and acceleration processes are distributed spatially , differences in physical time - scales for particles of different energy",
    "effectively may add a further geometric effect by inducing inhomogeneities ( stratification ) in the source ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we would like to illustrate with an extremely simple toy - model some aspects of the role of the geometry of the emitting region , and its interplay with some of the intrinsic physical time - scales , responsible for the fact that the peaks of the simulated light curves did not correspond to either the time when the shock exits the active region and injection is not present anywhere anymore , or to the time corresponding to the largest cross - section of the cylindrical volume along planes of equal observed times . in figures  [ fig : standard_lc]c ,  [ fig : empty_fg_lc]c ,  [ fig : bettersed_lc]c , these two times are marked as the second dashed grey line and the red - dotted line , respectively .",
    "moreover , the shift changes with the light curve energy band as noticeable in the case of light curves .    to illustrate how time shifts are caused by the different size of the observable regions filled with electrons contributing most of the emission at those frequencies , we consider a purely geometrical model solely based on the ` appearance ' of slices of different thickness through a cylinder .    like in our real blob model , a shock is traveling along the axis of symmetry of the cylinder turning ` on ' a thin local slice .",
    "each point of this slice stays ` on ' for a limited time , @xmath191 .",
    "we do not consider a variation of brightness with time , just an on / off state .",
    "we build light curves where ` flux ' is simply the size of the volume that is seen ` on ' by the observer at any given time . the ` on ' volume visible at each time from the observer point of view",
    "is computed taking into account light travel times and it cuts through the cylinder along planes yielding constant arrival time to the observer . for an observer viewing the cylinder at an angle @xmath192 with respect to its axis ,",
    "the loci of points whose photons he sees simultaneously are planes with an inclination @xmath193 with respect to the face of the cylinder ( @xmath194 with respect to the cylinder axis ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : toy_model_cartoon ] shows a 2d schematic of the geometry of the problem .    ) .",
    "the black rectangle represents a side 2d view of the cylinder , with @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( same aspect ratio of our simulations ) .",
    "the grey dashed line represents the ` shock front ' traveling at the speed of light through the cylinder , along its axis of symmetry , in the direction marked by the arrows .",
    "the green arrow represents the direction to the observer , while the green lines ( solid and dotted ) are planes perpendicular to the line of sight . in this example",
    "the viewing angle is @xmath197 .",
    "the red lines represent the loci of points whose photons reach the observer simultaneously , taking into account the  shock  travel distance / time until of their activation and the light travel time to the observer since that moment .",
    "the blue dashed lines illustrate this by showing three paths of equal length from the beginning of the ` flare ' .",
    "the red loci form an angle @xmath194 with the line of sight or , equivalently , an angle @xmath193 with the front face of the volume .",
    "[ fig : toy_model_cartoon ] ]    if the cylinder was moving with lorentz factor @xmath102 , because of relativistic aberration at a viewing angle @xmath198 we would be observing the radiation that in the comoving frame leaves the cylinder ` sideways ' , at 90@xmath199 from its axis . the observed frequencies would be blue - shifted and times compressed , but that would be simply a scaling factor applied uniformly to them and for convenience we can chose to use observed frequencies and times . therefore observing the toy - model at @xmath200 is equivalent to observing the relativistically moving blob at @xmath201 , and in turn this purely geometrical analysis captures some of the features of the realistic model studied in this paper .",
    "the results are illustrated in figure  [ fig : toy_model_lc ] . in the first panel",
    ", we show the general features of the light curves obtained with this model , most importantly the effect of the change in the duration @xmath191 . in figure",
    "[ fig : toy_model_lc]a we plot the curves for three cases , showing the shift of the flare peak to later time as @xmath191 increases . for very short",
    "@xmath191 the maximum is reached at the expected time , that is when size of the plane that is the locus of points simultaneously seen by the observer ( red lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : toy_model_cartoon ] ) is the largest possible for the given viewing angle . in general , however , the light curve peak will be shifted by @xmath202 .",
    "there is also a widening of the light curve , though much less noticeable than the peak shift .",
    "it is worth noting that at this extreme level of simplification geometric effects can not produce any asymmetry in the light curves .",
    "we tried to reproduce with this toy - model the light curves from the simulations of the first scenario presented here .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : toy_model_lc]b , c .",
    "the central panel shows the curves obtained by adjusting @xmath191 to match the peak time of the two light curves ( plotted with symbols ) , yielding a very satisfactory result for values around 0.35 and 0.65 @xmath177 .",
    "however the overall shape of the flares can not be matched well without adding a baseline component , to mimic in some way the fact that in the simulations the blob was already ` on ' at a low level prior to the beginning of the injection .",
    "we therefore added to the toy - model light curves a slowly decaying component , with an initial level such that the combination of the two components would match the data . since in the simulations",
    "the pre - existing component is left to evolve ( cool ) starting at the beginning of the active phase , here we let the baseline component decay too .",
    "the visual matching is not critically sensitive to the exact values of the decay slopes , and to make the model more constrained we forced them to be in a fixed ratio with respect to the chosen @xmath191 , by considering that the cooling times of the electrons emitting the baseline photons are also related to their energies . for the results shown in figure  [ fig : toy_model_lc]c the slope is equal to five times @xmath191 for both cases .    the synchrotron cooling time - scale for electrons emitting in the @xmath203kev and @xmath204kev bands , following the approximate expression of eq .",
    "[ eq : tau_sync_parameterized ] are @xmath205 , @xmath206 .",
    "given the steepness of the spectrum the emission in each band is dominated by the lower energy electrons , hence the longer @xmath6 is probably a more appropriate estimate .",
    "on the other hand , the above cooling time - scales only consider synchrotron cooling . including some additional loss due to",
    "ic would decrease the value of @xmath6 . in any case",
    ", the similarity between these crude estimates of cooling time - scales and the values of @xmath191 corroborates the success of the geometrical toy - model at fitting the simulation light curves .",
    "the ability of the purely geometrical toy - model to reproduce the two light curves is indeed remarkable .",
    "for this is facilitated by the fact that the synchrotron emission is independent on the internal delays due to photon diffusion that affect the evolution of the ic emission from the blob .",
    "it is not possible to apply a similar toy - model to the light curves .",
    "it is worth noting that although this test shows how dominant the effect of the geometry can be in shaping the light curve , at the same time we need to highlight that some geometry parameters , such as the ` thickness ' of the visible slices , are in effect determined by the physical conditions of the emission region .    in this respect",
    "it is interesting to note that , at least in the setup of the scenarios presented in this work , despite the apparent dominance of the source geometry the effect of the energy dependent physics - induced geometrical factors is detectable .",
    "hence multiwavelength datasets and time - resolved spectroscopy have the potential to disentangle them from the source geometry .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ]    we introduced a coupled fokker  planck and monte carlo code allowing us to study blazar phenomenology in unprecedented detail with a time dependent and multi - zone model properly taking into account all light travel time effects .",
    "we presented three test scenarios , aimed at modeling the variability exhibited by during the 2001 march 19 flare , and based on a relatively standard choice of parameters .",
    "the results of these tests are summarized in table  [ tab : scorecard ] , side by side with the features observed in the actual multiwavelength observations @xcite .",
    "there are a few fundamental issues that we wanted to address , which are common throughout the phenomenology of all well studied blue blazars .    1 .   the shape of the flares , often quasi - symmetric for a wide range of observational bands where the intensity variations are large ( the main ones being and ) .",
    "2 .   the characteristics of the correlation between and fluxes .",
    "there has been great interest in the slope of their relationship , in particular because of the observation of a quadratic , or higher order , relationship holding throughout some well sampled outbursts , challenging our understanding of the physical conditions and causes of the variability .",
    "3 .   the phase of the correlation between variations in different bands , namely the existence of time lags and their duration .",
    "none of the three test scenarios was able to reproduce all the characteristics of the 2001 march 19 flare .",
    "two features have been particularly challenging to match : the relationship between and tev fluxes on the decay phase of the flare , and the intra - band time lag .",
    "moreover , the shape ( symmetry ) of the flare light curves could be reproduced only by one of the three scenarios , case  1 .",
    "these aspects of phenomenology are among those more affected by the spatial extent and geometry of the source , whose influence varies with observed energy band because of the relative importance of geometrical and physical time - scales .",
    "the impact of the geometrical factor , both due to the source intrinsic structure and to the stratification of properties due to the physical processes , emphasizes the necessity of a code like the one we introduce here for modeling the variable high energy emission from blazar jets .",
    "the difficulty of producing a quadratic relationship between the fluxes in the and during the declining phase of the flare may indicate that radiative cooling can not fully explain the electron cooling mechanism .",
    "the delayed evolution of the seed photon field due to internal lcte compounds the problem .",
    "one alternative possibility could be a process causing energy loss over a wide range of electrons energies ( such that the ic seed photons are also affected ) on very similar / same time - scale , such as adiabatic cooling , which could be associated with expansion of the blob , or particle escape .",
    "they are often invoked in qualitative discussions and in the context of simpler models , treated by means of some phenomenological prescription .",
    "the addition of such mechanisms to the code in a proper astrophysical way is not immediate , but we are working on its implementation .",
    "the escape term present in the fokker - planck equation is actually neglected for these set of simulations . in a follow up",
    "work including particle acceleration and escape , this latter seems to be effective and we obtain a quadratic flux relationship and hard lags @xcite .",
    "about the effect of adiabatic expansion of the emitting blob , based on the simplified analysis of @xcite , @xcite , argue against its viability once the implications of this expansion on the magnetic field and particle cooling are taken into account .",
    "nevertheless , its effect should be assessed with actual time - dependent simulations of a source of finite size .    as to the hard intra - band lags , in section  [ sec : applications : geometric_effects ] by means of a toy - model we illustrated an important factor affecting observations of time - lags : source ` stratification ' combined with lcte induces a systematic soft lag .",
    "the simulations presented in this work do not include an acceleration term , hence the lack of hard lags is not a complete surprise .",
    "nevertheless , the induced systematic geometric soft lag introduces an additional constraint on viable electron acceleration and injection scenarios . in this respect ,",
    "the results of the above mentioned study focused on lags @xcite suggest that continuous acceleration , spatially extended ( diffuse diffusive acceleration due to turbulence , @xcite ) , may be necessary , possibly accompanied by an achromatic energy loss mechanism .",
    "it is interesting that this type of scenario seems to be able to produce also a quadratic /tev relationship throughout a flare .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of this analysis was the comparison between two possible hypotheses for the presence of an additional component contributing to the observed sed .",
    "the need for two components , a flaring and a quasi - steady one , to interpret some of the observations has become more evident with the improvement of multiwavelength observations ( for an interesting decomposition of a suzaku spectrum of see * ? ? ? * ) . disentangling these two components is necessary in order to understand the nature of the transient activity whose properties need to be seen more clearly .",
    "this decomposition might also yield information on the average properties of the relativistic jet , for which the less variable component might be more representative .",

    "this pre - existing component can be interpreted as due to the remnants of a previous outburst .",
    "ii ) that the secondary component is completely independent from the flare , and it contributes just a steady sed diluting the transient component from the observer point of view .",
    "our simulations offer some hints as to their viability , and they favor the first type of scenario .",
    "one fundamental difference between the two alternatives concerns the production of ic emission , the tev band .",
    "if the observed sed consists of the sum of two independent contributions , emitted by electrons at two different locations then the only seed photons for ic scattering will be those produced by the injected electrons themselves . starting from an empty blob , the energy density of synchrotron seed photons needs some time to build up , which naturally results in a delay in the variation of the ic scattered .",
    "this delay is caused by internal lcte and it turned out to be quite significant as illustrated by the tev light curve of case  2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : empty_fg_lc]c ) , yielding a flat - top flare not seen in observations . that tev light curve is in fact an excellent example of lctes at work and of the importance of a more advanced modeling code .",
    "naturally , the cases presented in this paper only represent an initial study aimed at investigating the importance of lcte which for the first time could be fully accounted for .",
    "these results can not be considered conclusive .",
    "nonetheless , despite their limited scope they make a strong case for a true time - dependent and multi - zone modeling .",
    "the three scenarios discussed can be generally regarded as homogeneous blob scenarios .",
    "the magnetic field is the same throughout the simulation volume , and isotropic . for what concerns electrons , the initial setup is homogeneous and the injection is identical in all zones",
    ". it is , however , worth emphasizing that during the evolution of the simulation electrons properties become inhomogeneous because of the different radiative cooling they experience in different zones .",
    "these simulations represent a first order implementation of a class of scenarios for blazar flares often discussed in the literature , envisaging a shock acting on a discrete blob / shell within the jet .",
    "we adopted a volume with relatively symmetric aspect ratio , to not depart too much from the sphere ` implied ' by one - zone models while making it possible to appreciate the effects of geometry , and attributed the flare to the injection of a fresh electron population .",
    "as discussed in sections  [ sec : applications : goals ] , [ sec : applications : parameter_choice ] , and [ sec : applications : parameter_estimates ] the main physical parameters are fairly well constrained and the results can be regarded as meaningful for what concerns the time - varying components of the model , as well as the nature of the secondary emission component .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper suggest that a simple injection in the radiating region of particles with a formed spectrum produced in a separate acceleration region whose emission is not significant , does not provide a satisfactory match with some basic observational facts .",
    "moreover , the comparison of the background and foreground component scenarios , in particular with respect to the tev evolution , clearly favoring the first one ( case  1 ) , suggests that if a flare is caused by a change affecting the electron population it may be necessary for it to happen on a relatively hot blob , acting on the same particles , re - accelerating them .",
    "this in turn would support a scenario where flares are not fully independent of each other but rather occur in the same region .",
    "we are working on a few directions of expansion of this investigation .",
    "the main immediate focus is on the two unsolved issues of hard intra - band lags and -tev flux correlation and we have introduced particle acceleration and escape @xcite .",
    "further areas of study concern inhomogeneities and different geometries , which can be easily studied with this code .",
    "we can introduce a spatial structure to the magnetic field , either static or changing according to some prescription , which could be motivated as caused by compression and amplification of the tangled field by a shock , and we plan to expand the code to deal with anisotropic magnetic field .",
    "we have started to simulate more ` exotic ' geometries , elongated or flattened blobs , and the effect of an energy release in a small sub - region ( bubble ) embedded in the simulated volume .",
    "a particularly timely line of investigation concerns red blazars like fsrqs . because the peak of their high energy component occurs in the less accessible mev ",
    "gev band , they have received much more limited attention , except at the time of _ egret _ , that however lacked the sensitivity to follow even bright sources throughout their full variability cycles .",
