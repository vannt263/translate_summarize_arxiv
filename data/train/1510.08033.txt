    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a promising candidate beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "dynamical susy breaking gives a beautiful explanation for the question why the electroweak scale is so small compared to the planck scale or the unification scale @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) and the gauge mediation mechanism  @xcite ( for reviews , see e.g. @xcite ) can naturally explain why dangerous flavor - changing neutral currents are highly suppressed .",
    "anomaly based on gauge mediation  @xcite are more convincing than those based on gravity mediation . this is because the light slepton and chargino / neutralino are always required . ]",
    "however , the observed higgs mass , 125 gev , may conflict to a minimal realization of such a scenario @xcite . to obtain the observed higgs mass in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , a significant radiative correction from top / stop loops",
    "@xcite are required , then , in the gauge mediation scenario , sparticle masses should be very large because there is no large stop trilinear coupling .",
    "the simplest modification would be to add a sm singlet chiral superfield @xmath0 .",
    "in such a model , the @xmath1 superpotential interaction provides an additional @xmath2-term contribution to the higgs potential and it can push the lightest higgs boson mass up without large stop contributions .",
    "this is known as the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) and have been widely investigated so far ( for reviews , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the additional @xmath2-term contribution to the higgs potential is appealing , the viable parameter space is restricted because large singlet couplings , e.g. , @xmath1 tends to blow up at high energy .",
    "furthermore , such a singlet extension of the gauge mediation scenario is not straightforward : since the singlet does not have any sm gauge charge , the susy breaking hardly mediates to the singlet sector , which makes it difficult to achieve the correct electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) ; therefore , further extensions , e.g. , introducing extra vector - like matter fields coupling to @xmath0  @xcite , invariant nmssm is solved with these new vector - like matter fields , which make @xmath3 anomalous . ] and the coupling between @xmath0 and messengers  @xcite have been studied .",
    "the solution may be  hidden \" . in this paper",
    ", we propose a possibility that the nmssm singlet is a meson in the hidden sector .",
    "this meson is composed by particles which are charged under a strong gauge symmetry as in fat higgs models  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the strong gauge symmetry provides a meta - stable susy breaking vacuum around the origin of the field space @xcite and messengers of gauge mediation also couple to the susy breaking sector @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 coupling is provided by integrating out some heavy particles charged under the strong gauge symmetry , then , the particle decoupling is also a trigger of the confining dynamics and creates a meta - stable susy breaking vacuum .    since the singlet is also a member of the hidden sector , the susy breaking can mediate to the singlet directly .",
    "in fact , the singlet receives the susy breaking at two loop and it plays an important role to achieve the correct ewsb in our scenario . although this is not a gauge - mediated susy breaking , such a soft mass of the singlet does not cause dangerous flavor - changing neutral currents either .",
    "supposing the tev superparticle mass spectrum , a viable susy breaking scale will be about @xmath4-@xmath5 tev in our scenario .",
    "this would be also an appealing prediction .",
    "such a @xmath4 tev susy breaking provides a cosmologically safe gravitino mass of order ev .",
    "a large @xmath1 coupling is possible because the singlet composite scale is not very far from the electroweak scale . also by the naturalness discussion of the ewsb  @xcite ,",
    "such a low messenger scale is favored because radiative corrections to the higgs potential can be relatively small due to the short running .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present our model and discuss the formation of the nmssm singlet and the dynamical susy breaking in that model .",
    "the mediation of the susy breaking to ordinary superpartners is also discussed . in section iii , we show expected mass spectra at the electroweak scale and investigate the phenomenology of the model . in section iv , we conclude the discussion and comment on possible future directions .",
    "in this section , we first present our model and describe the formation of the nmssm singlet and dynamical susy breaking at a meta - stable vacuum .",
    "a 2-loop radiative correction from the susy breaking sector generates a negative soft mass - squared for the singlet .",
    "we also explain gauge - mediated susy breaking for ordinary superparticles .",
    ".the matter content and charge assignment of a model of the composite nmssm with dynamical susy breaking and its gauge mediation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      before closing this section , let us discuss cosmological aspects and implications to the collider signals . in our model ,",
    "the gravitino mass is estimated as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a typical value of @xmath8 , provided @xmath9 .    to satisfy the warm dark matter constraint",
    ", the gravitino should be lighter than 16ev  @xcite , and in this range there is no constraint on the reheating temperature .",
    "then , the messenger scale is bounded from above as @xmath10 with @xmath11 which is required not to conflict with @xmath12 . on the other hand , to avoid the unstable susy breaking minimum with a life - time shorter than the age of the universe , the messenger scale should be  @xcite @xmath13 combining the above three conditions , we get the upper - bound on @xmath14 as @xmath15 for @xmath16 , it is difficult to satisfy this upper - bound taking into account null results of latest lhc susy searches . by demanding that the gluino mass , @xmath17 , be larger than 1.4 ( 1.6 )",
    "tev , the lower - bound on @xmath14 is @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , @xmath20 is required . with the very light gravitino ,",
    "the next - to - lightest susy particle ( nlsp ) , which is likely to be the stau in our model , decays promptly  @xcite . in our case , right - handed sleptons are almost degenerated in mass , and the strong constraint comes from the susy searches in final states with multi - jets , multi - leptons ( @xmath21 ) and missing transverse momentum  @xcite .",
    "the chargino needs to be heavier than 850 - 900 gev , resulting in the lower - bound on the gluino mass as @xmath22-@xmath23 tev with a gut relation among gaugino masses . here",
    ", @xmath17 is the gluino mass .    in the meantime , if the gravitino mass is in a range @xmath24 the gravitino can be a cold dark matter  @xcite with an appropriate reheating temperature or the late - time entropy production  @xcite .",
    "the lower bound on the gravitino mass in turn leads to the lower bound on the messenger scale : @xmath25 or equivalently @xmath26 in this case , the stability bound of the susy breaking minimum , eq.([eq : stability2 ] ) , is no longer important .",
    "note that the messenger scale can be still low as @xmath27 gev for @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ( see eq .",
    "( [ weff ] ) ) .    since the typical decay length of the nlsp is @xmath30 m , the stau nlsp",
    "is strongly constrained as @xmath31450 - 500 gev  @xcite , where @xmath32 is the ( lighter ) stau mass .",
    "therefore , the bino nlsp predicted with @xmath16 may be favored if the gravitino is the cold dark matter . in this case , the lhc signatures as well as limits of susy particle masses are similar to those in gravity mediation , and the strongest constraint comes from the susy searches with multi - jets and missing transverse momentum .",
    "so far , it is expected that @xmath331.4 - 1.6tev is required  @xcite , depending on the squark mass .",
    "finally , we show the typical mass spectra and fine - tuning measure @xmath34 in table  [ tab : sample point ] . at the point * i * with @xmath16 , the bino - like neutralino is the nlsp and @xmath35kev which enables us to explain the observed dark matter by the gravitino . as discussed above , the gravitino mass with @xmath36 ev",
    "is difficult to be achieved in this case . on the other hand , at the points @xmath37 , the stau is the nlsp ; therefore , @xmath36 ev is required to avoid the strong constraint on the stable stau without increasing the susy mass scale .",
    "in such a very light gravitino region , there is no constraint on the reheating temperature and the observed dark matter relic would be explained by another particle ( e.g. qcd axion ) .",
    "we have proposed a new scheme for the nmssm in gauge mediation , where in general the successful ewsb does not occur due to the absence of the soft susy breaking mass parameter for @xmath0 . in our framework",
    ", @xmath0 is a composite meson in the hidden qcd , which is responsible for the dynamical susy breaking .",
    "the required soft susy breaking mass for @xmath0 naturally arises after susy is broken dynamically , and the electroweak symmetry is successfully broken .",
    "although the uv lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ wmodel ] ) contains two singlets , it is possible to construct a model without singlets as shown in appendix a , where the required particle content becomes less . in this case",
    ", there are additional contributions to the soft masses for the singlet and higgs doublets , and all trilinear couplings .",
    "the stop , sbottom and stau masses are also modified .",
    "therefore , the quite different phenomenology is expected to appear .    as a concrete model of the dynamical susy breaking , we have utilized the iss model . however , it is possible to consider other dynamical susy breaking models .",
    "for instance , if the iyit model @xcite is adopted , a model similar to the dirac nmssm  @xcite appears as a low - energy effective theory  @xcite , which also increases the higgs boson mass in a similar but different way .",
    "it needs to be checked whether the correct ewsb is explained .    in our model",
    ", the gravitino can be either very light as @xmath38ev or @xmath30kev . in the former case",
    ", there is no upper bound for the reheating temperature , but the gravitino can not explain the observed dark matter abundance .",
    "one needs another candidate for a dark matter .",
    "for instance , the stable baryon in the hidden qcd may explain the observed abundance of the dark matter .",
    "in the latter case , the gravitino is cold enough and a dark matter candidate .",
    "although the gravitino tends to be over - produced in general , it is possible to fit for the standard cosmology if the late - time entropy production exists  @xcite .",
