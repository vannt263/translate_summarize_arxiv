    "high sensitivity parameter estimation is an active area of research in quantum physics .",
    "there is growing effort both theoretically and experimentally to use quantum properties of matter to improve the precision with which a given parameter may be estimated .",
    "these ideas have been used in several problems of practical interest ; namely , clock synchronization @xcite , reference frame alignment @xcite , phase estimation @xcite , frequency measurements @xcite , position measurements @xcite and magnetometry @xcite . the simplest procedure for parameter estimation uses a probe which is coupled to the external field ( @xmath0 ) to be measured by a hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "the probe is prepared in a well - known initial state and then interacts with the field for a time @xmath2 before the measurement of a suitable observable @xmath3 .",
    "the process is then repeated for a large number of times ( @xmath4 ) to improve statistics .",
    "many different strategies have been proposed to improve the sensitivity limit of the simple parameter estimation procedure  @xcite .",
    "for example , the probe can be a composite system @xcite or be augmented by ancillary systems used for multiple quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the external field hamiltonian can be manipulated by additional field - independent and controllable hamiltonians to obtain an effective hamiltonian @xmath5  @xcite . during the evolution time",

    "the only constraint on the metrology procedure is that a single measurement time is limited to @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption is physically motivated as any measurement process suffers from decoherence that limits the sensing time .",
    "the quantum cramer - rao bound gives a bound on the achievable sensitivity  @xcite . for any measurement scheme , if the largest and smallest eigenvalues of @xmath6 are @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , the optimum possible sensitivity is bounded by : @xmath9 where @xmath4 is the number of measurement runs and we set @xmath10 .",
    "this is very similar to the heisenberg limit for precision measurements with entangled states where in the heisenberg limit @xmath11 is related to the number of entangled spins used for the quantum measurement  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a new rigorous proof of this theorem .",
    "our approach is to reduce general parameter estimation problems often studied in the literature ( involving e.g. larger systems , mixed states or povms ) to the case of a two - level system .",
    "furthermore we extend the bound validity showing that multiple rounds of povms and feedback can not improve this limit .",
    "we first prove in section [ tls ] the sensitivity bound for a single povm measurement on an isolated two - level system in a pure state .",
    "the proof relies on the classical fisher information ( reviewed in the appendix ) , which provides a lower bound on the uncertainty of parameter estimation via multiple measurements in terms of the probabilities of various measurement outcomes .",
    "we then show in section [ nls ] that for the purposes of precision measurement a general @xmath4-level system prepared in a pure state is equivalent to a two - level system .",
    "specifically , we will demonstrate an explicit reduction of the @xmath4-level system to one of its two dimensional subspaces ; then extend these results to the case where a control hamiltonian is added to the field dependent hamiltonian ( @xmath12 ) by going to an appropriate interaction picture . by using `` convexity '' properties of fisher information and cauchy - schwartz inequalities ,",
    "we also prove in section [ mixed ] the bound for mixed states .    in section [ feedback ]",
    "we further prove that these results are still valid when feedback during the measurement and classical communication between different measurement rounds are available , situations where the cramer - rao bound has not been proved before .",
