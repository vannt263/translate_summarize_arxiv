    "<S> however , the new algorithm proposed recently by lscher @xcite has become attractive for it brings new views in full qcd simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the way it is implemented makes it suffer from the critical slowing down , which is mainly caused by the local heatbath update of the bosonic fields @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we want in lattice qcd to estimate the determinant of the quark matrix . for two </S>",
    "<S> degenerate quarks it can be written as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wilson matrix with @xmath5 let @xmath6 be an order @xmath7 polynomial with roots , @xmath8 , @xmath9 such that @xmath10 let @xmath11 be the error of the polynomial approximation , which is defined as @xmath12 lscher s original proposal uses the hermitian quark matrix @xmath13 and a real polynomial with complex conjugate roots . as we have proposed in @xcite , a non - hermitian approximation is expected to work better than the hermitian one .    </S>",
    "<S> the method consists in the following equalities : @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 [ d{\\phi}_k ]       e^{-{\\phi}_k^{\\dag } ( w - z_k)^{\\dag }                           ( w - z_k ) { \\phi}_k } \\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the rank of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we use as @xmath18 the chebyshev polynomials defined in the complex plane @xcite which have certain optimal properties .    </S>",
    "<S> as opposed to hmc , this method introduces a local effective quark action on both gauge and scalar fields @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , this allows a local monte carlo ( mc ) update of these fields . </S>",
    "<S> the most important question is which algorithm is cheaper . </S>",
    "<S> we answer this question by theoretical arguments and propose a global heatbath update for the scalar fields .    </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the volume ( @xmath20 ) and quark mass ( @xmath1 ) dependence of the cost , which we denote by @xmath21 ( denoting by @xmath20 both the volume and the rank of the matrix should not cause any ambiguity : they are proportional ) . clearly , each mc sweep has a cost proportional to the volume of the lattice , the number of the bosonic fields and the autocorrelation time @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we suppose that the gauge and scalar fields are updated locally by the heatbath algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the cost of the algorithm will scale like @xmath23 random walk arguments allow us to assume that @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the correlation length of the operator @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> then it is clear that @xmath27^{-1}||_2\\ ] ] where @xmath28 denotes the 2-norm of a matrix . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we need explicitly the roots of the chebyshev polynomial which are given by @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the center of the spectrum and @xmath31 is the focal distance of the ellipse that encloses the spectrum . in the asymptotic regime , as @xmath32 , the roots approach a dense set of points , the ellipse that passes through the origin </S>",
    "<S> . clearly we obtain @xmath33 which is independent of @xmath34 . assuming that the smallest singular value of @xmath4 behaves like @xmath35 we estimate the autocorrelation time to scale like @xmath36 on the other hand the dynamics of the gauge fields is coupled to that of the bosonic fields . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen if we look at the step size of one gauge field update . </S>",
    "<S> we use a slightly different argument of @xcite and write @xmath37 we see that for wilson fermions the bosonic part of the action is quadratic on gauge fields @xmath38 and the variance of the corresponding distribution is proportional to @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the step size of a gauge field update is proportional to @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> as result , the autocorrelation time will be proportional to @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> then the total cost of the simulation will scale like @xmath41 to see how the number of boson fields scales with the volume and the quark mass , we consider the error @xmath42 of the approximation : @xmath43 - 1\\ ] ] or in the eigenvalue basis @xmath44 - 1\\ ] ] let @xmath45 be an uniform upper bound for @xmath46 ( i.e. for each @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> then it can be easily shown that @xmath48 so that in the asymptotic regime ( @xmath7 large and @xmath45 small ) we obtain @xmath49 for chebyshev polynomials and small @xmath1 we have @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an @xmath52 real constant . in this way </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath53 keeping the approximation error constant this means that @xmath7 will scale like @xmath54 so that the total cost scales like @xmath55 the cost of the hmc algorithm scales at best like @xcite @xmath56 this shows that the lscher s algorithm scales better with the volume then hmc , whereas the opposite can be said for the scaling with the quak mass . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations of dynamical fermions for an @xmath57 gauge theory with the multi - boson algorithm and kramers algorithm show that they perform comparably , the latter being a bit faster @xcite , a fact that supports our argument .    </S>",
    "<S> however , one can try to reduce the autocorrelation time , so that the algorithm can compare favourably to hmc . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved by performing a global heatbath on the scalar fields .      </S>",
    "<S> consider a global heatbath update of the bosonic fields in the form @xmath58 this step is very costly because the inversion is not necessary well conditioned . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we propose a well conditioned inversion to take place : we use as a polynomial preconditioner the chebyshev polynomials @xmath18 of the multi - bosonic method and write the above global update as @xmath59 where @xmath60^{-1}\\ ] ] the factor @xmath61 , has its inverse in one of the factors of @xmath62 , so that we do not need to compute it . </S>",
    "<S> we have to invert instead the better conditioned matrix @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this computation has to take place anyway for the exact version of the multi - boson algorithm proposed in @xcite . if @xmath34 is the number of iterative steps for the above inversion to converge , its cost will scale like @xmath64 it remains to see how @xmath34 scales with the volume and the quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath63 is given by @xmath65 we had @xmath66 so that we obtain @xmath67 and the number of iterations @xmath34 scales like @xmath68 as the quark mass is fixed and @xmath7 grows , the matrix @xmath63 is well conditioned . in any case </S>",
    "<S> an optimal iterative solver requires a minimum number of steps to converge that grows like @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen for example by modeling our well conditioned problem as an inversion of the quark matrix in one dimension ( i.e. the quantum mechanics of a fermion particle ) . </S>",
    "<S> this problem can be solved by divide and conquer : by even - odd splitting the original lattice we obtain two decoupled sublattices , which of them can be split similarly in two sublattices and so on ( the first step as we know can be used in higher dimensions too ) . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the number of steps needed to arrive at one - site sublattices is @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this way , we finally get @xmath70 and the inversion cost will scale like @xmath71 the total cost scales like @xmath72 with @xmath73 , so that finally we obtain @xmath74    the cost of the algorithm with a global heatbath update of the scalar fields decreases by a factor @xmath1 . the overhead is a factor @xmath2 in the volume . since the arguments are given in the limiting case @xmath75 and @xmath32 , we expect the simulations to verify the above cost scaling in this limit </S>",
    "<S> . for moderate masses and number of bosonic fields the algorithm can scale better .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the above scaling analysis dos not take into account the prefactors in the cost of the inversion that can make the simulations expensive . </S>",
    "<S> we stress the fact that if the inversion techniques become less costly , the global heatbath algorithm can be a real alternative to the local one . </S>"
