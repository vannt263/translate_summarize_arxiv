    "quantum transport incorporating with initial correlations in nanostructures is a long - standing problem in mesoscopic physics.@xcite in the past two decades , investigations of quantum transport are mainly focused on steady - state phenomena,@xcite where initial correlations are not essential due to the memory loss effect .",
    "recent experimental developments allow one to measure transient quantum transport in different nano and quantum devices.@xcite in the transient transport regime , initial correlations could induce different transport effects . in this paper , using the exact master equation approach.@xcite we shall attempt to address the transient quantum transport incorporating with initial correlations .",
    "conventional approaches for studying quantum transport include the scattering theory,@xcite the nonequilibrium green function technique,@xcite and the master equation approach.@xcite in the steady - state quantum transport regime , the famous landauer - bttiker formula@xcite has been widely utilized to calculate successfully various transport properties in semiconductor nanostructures.@xcite in the landauer - bttiker formula , the transport current is given in terms of a simple transmission coefficient obtained from the single - particle scattering matrix .",
    "however , the scattering theory considers the reservoirs connecting to the scattering region ( the device system ) to be always in equilibrium and electrons in the reservoir are always incoherent .",
    "thus , the landauer - bttiker formula becomes invalid to transient quantum transport .",
    "the scattering theory method could be extended to deal with time - dependent transport phenomena , through the so - called the floquet scattering theory,@xcite but it is only applicable to the case of the time - dependent quantum transport for systems driven by periodic time - dependent external fields .    the nonequilibrium green function technique based on keldysh formalism@xcite has also been used extensively to investigate the steady - state quantum transport in mesoscopic systems , where the initial correlations were also ignored.@xcite in comparison with the scattering theory approach , the nonequilibrium green function technique provides a more microscopic picture to electron transport by formulating the transport current or more specifically the transmission coefficients in terms of the nonequilibrium electron green functions of the device system in the nanostructures.@xcite wingreen _ et al .",
    "_  extended keldysh s nonequilibrium green function technique to time - dependent quantum transport under time - dependent external bias and gate voltages.@xcite but in the keldysh formalism , nonequilibrium green functions are defined with the initial time @xmath0 , where the initial correlations are hardly taken into account , which makes the technique to be useful mostly in the nonequilibrium steady - state regime .",
    "the transient quantum transport was first proposed by cini , @xcite under the so - called partition - free scheme . in this scheme , the whole system ( the device system plus the leads together ) is in thermal equilibrium up to time @xmath1 , and then one applies the external bias to let electrons flow .",
    "thus , the device system and the leads are initially correlated .",
    "stefanucci _ et . al . _",
    "@xcite adapted nonequilibrium green functions with the kadanoff - baym formalism@xcite to investigate the transient quantum transport with the partition - free scheme proposed by cini.@xcite they obtained an analytic transient transport current in the wide - band limit .",
    "but in these works,@xcite the transport solution is given with the nonequilibrium green functions of the total system , rather than the green functions for the device part of the nanostructure.@xcite thus the advantage of simplifying the microscopic picture of quantum transport in terms of nonequilibrium green functions of the device system may not be so obvious as in the meir - wingreen formula.@xcite    on the other hand , the master equation approach@xcite concerns the dynamic properties of the device system in terms of the time evolution of the reduced density matrix @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the trace over the environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "the dissipation and fluctuation dynamics of the device system induced by the reservoirs are fully manifested through the master equation .",
    "also , all the transport properties can be derived from the master equation . in principle , the master equation for the quantum transport can be investigated in terms of the real - time diagrammatic expansion approach up to all the orders.@xcite however , most of master equations are obtained by the perturbation theory up to the second order of the system - lead couplings , which is mainly applicable in the sequential tunneling regime.@xcite an interesting development of master equations in quantum transport systems is the hierarchical expansion of the equations of motion for the reduced density matrix,@xcite which provided a systematical and also quite useful numerical calculation scheme to quantum transport .",
    "a few years ago , we derived the exact master equation for non - interacting nano - devices,@xcite using the feynman - vernon influence functional approach@xcite in the coherent - state representation .",
    "the obtained exact master equation not only describes the quantum state dynamics of the device system but also takes into account all the transient electronic transport properties .",
    "the transient transport current can be directly obtained from the exact master equation , which turns out to be expressed by the nonequilibrium green functions of the device system .",
    "this unifies the master equation approach and the nonequilibrium green function technique for quantum transport .",
    "however , the exact master equation given in ref .",
    "[ ] is derived in the partitioned scheme in which the system and the leads are initially uncorrelated .",
    "the result transport current is consistent with the meir - wingreen formula.@xcite this new theory has also been used to study quantum transport ( including the transient transport ) for various nanostructures recently.@xcite however , realistically , it is possible and often unavoidable in experiments that the device system and the leads are initially correlated . therefore , the transient transport theory based on master equation that takes the effect of initial correlations into account deserves of a further investigation .    in this paper , we obtain the exact master equation including the effect of initial correlations for non - interacting nanostructures through the extended quantum langevin equation.@xcite we find that the initial correlations only affect on the fluctuation dynamics of the device system , while the dissipation dynamics remains the same as in the case of initially uncorrelated states . the transient transport current in the presence of initial system - lead and lead - lead correlations",
    "are also obtained directly from the exact master equation .",
    "this transient transport theory is suitable for arbitrary initial states between the system and its reservoirs , so that it naturally covers both the partitioned and partition - free schemes studied in previous works.@xcite taking an experimentally realizable nano - fabrication system , a single - level quantum dot coupled to two one - dimensional tight - binding leads , as an specific example , we examine in detail the initial correlation effects in the transient transport current as well as in the electron occupation of the device system .    in particular , we find that the electron occupation and transport current in the transient and also in the steady - state regimes can be different for partitioned and partition - free schemes when the system - lead couplings become strong , where localized bound states will appear in the dot system . the quantum transport in the presence of localized bound states has also been studied in the literatures.@xcite in fact , dhar and sen considered a wire connected to reservoirs that is modeled by a tight - binding noninteracting hamiltonian in the partitioned scheme,@xcite and they gave the steady - state solution of the density matrix and the current .",
    "their results show that the memory effects induced by the localized bound states can be observed such that the density matrix of the system is initial - state dependent .",
    "stefanucci used the kadanoff - baym formalism to formally study the localized bound state effects in the quantum transport in the partition - free scheme.@xcite he found that the biased system with localized bound states does not evolve toward a stationary state . in this paper , we present the detailed time evolution of the density matrix and the transient transport current for both the partitioned and partition - free schemes .",
    "the initial - state dependance of the density matrix in the partitioned scheme is obvious in our formalism , as given in eq .",
    "( [ rho11 ] ) .",
    "meanwhile , the result of the system being unable to reach a stationary state found by stefanucci@xcite is also reproduced in our calculation .",

    "iii , the transport dynamics with or without the initial correlations are explored in detail with a quantum dot device coupled to two leads modeled by one - dimensional tight - binding chains .",

    "compare fig .",
    "[ unbiased_case ] with fig .",
    "[ biased_case ] , one can find that the applied bias restrains most of the oscillation behavior in the electron occupation as well as in the transport current , except for the very beginning of the transient regime . also , regardless of the existence of localized bound states , the electron occupation and also the transport current all approach to a steady - state value other than zero due to the non - zero bias .",
    "in other words , the localized bound state has a less effect on the electron occupation and the transport current when a bias is applied .",
    "this is because , as we have pointed out in the discussion of fig.[u](c ) , the applied bias can reduce significantly the amplitude of one of the localized bound states , which suppress the oscillation of the transport electrons between two localized bound states .",
    "however , the remaining localized bound state will result in a small different steady - state values for partition - free and partitioned schemes only in the electron occupation .",
    "the corresponding transient current flow through the left and right leads are quite different when a bias voltage is applied .",
    "in particular , the transient transport current in the right lead is positive in the beginning for the partitioned scheme because the dot is initially empty , and it approaches to a negative steady - state value in both schemes .",
    "but the steady - state current is almost independent of the initial correlations as shown in the inset graphs in fig .",
    "[ biased_case ] .",
    "these result shows that the initial correlation effects are not so significant in the steady - state transport current in comparison with the electron occupation .    in the end , as a self - consistent check , we consider the case @xmath170 .",
    "for the partition - free scheme , the system should stay in equilibrium .",
    "our result is given in fig .",

    "because of the appearance of two localized bound states , the electron occupation in the dot will keep oscillation around a steady - state value , and the system would never reach to equilibrium with the leads .",

    "the other one is the partitioned scheme in which there is no initial correlations .",

    "when the coupling between the dot and the leads gets strong , localized bound states will appear , and these two schemes give some different results both in the transient regime and in the steady - state limit .",
    "it shows that the initial correlation effects can not be ignored if the localized bound states exist .",
    "besides , when the localized bound states occur , the device system can not approach to equilibrium with the leads , and the initial correlation effects become more significant .",
    "these initial correlation effects accompanied by the localized bound state could be restrained by applying a finite bias voltage .",
    "indeed , we find that a finite bias can suppress the oscillation behavior in the electron occupation and in the transport current induced by the simultaneous existence of two localized bound states .",
    "compare with electron occupation in the dot , the steady - state current is insensitive to the initial states , so the results are not so distinguishable between the partitioned and the partition - free schemes .",
    "nevertheless , the transport currents are quite different in the transient regime in these two schemes when the bias is applied .",
    "although we only consider a noninteracting nanostructure as a model in the detailed exploration of the initial correlation effects , it is not difficult to extend to include electron - electron interactions in our theory because the coefficients of the master equation are expressed in terms of the nonequilibrium green functions which can at least perturbatively or numerically handle the effect of electron - electron interactions .",
