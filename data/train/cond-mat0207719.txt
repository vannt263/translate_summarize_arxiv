    "the problem of elastic media pinned by an external potential provides a unifying framework for understanding a large number of condensed matter phenomena , such as for example surface growth @xcite , nonlinear transport in anisotropic metals @xcite , dissipation in superconductors @xcite , wigner crystals @xcite , earthquakes @xcite and friction @xcite .",
    "randomly - pinned elastic systems are also toy models for considerably more complicated problems of glasses @xcite .",
    "much of the recent interest in such problems has been rekindled by the discovery @xcite of high - temperature superconductors ( htsc ) , and efforts to understand the nature of their @xmath12 phase diagram and dissipation controlled by statics and dynamics of elastic arrays of vortex lines @xcite .",
    "a combination of thermal fluctuations , pinning , and external drive leads to a wide range of new and interesting collective phenomena that is common to many physical realizations of elastic media .",
    "there has been considerable progress in understanding the static properties of pinned elastic media @xcite .",
    "much of the recent interest has therefore shifted to dynamics , with current focus on nonequilibrium , driven dynamics of these rich systems @xcite . once the elastic medium is driven , however , many new questions arise , such as the governing nonequilibrium equation of motion , phase classification and stability , nature of the corresponding phase transitions , and the resulting nonequilibrium phase diagram @xcite . among these many challenging questions ,",
    "the velocity ( @xmath13 )  force ( @xmath3 ) characteristics ( the iv curve , in the context of superconductors and charge density waves ( cdw s ) ) is the observable that is most directly accessible experimentally @xcite and is therefore of considerable theoretical interest .    despite of considerable richness of many aspects of the driven state @xcite , at large drives the velocity - force characteristics of a uniformly sliding medium approaches ohmic form with deviations @xmath14 that can be computed perturbatively @xcite in the ratio @xmath15 . at zero temperature ,",
    "if elastic @xcite , the medium is pinned for drives smaller than a critical @xmath16 value @xmath17 , and undergoes a nonequilibrium depinning transition to a sliding state , with @xmath18 playing the role analogous to an order parameter distinguishing pinned and sliding phases @xcite .",
    "finite temperature rounds the depinning transition @xcite , allowing activated creep motion of the elastic solid even for drive far below @xmath17 .",
    "much of the insight about this highly nontrivial creep regime that is the focus of our work comes from a scaling theory of depinned droplet nucleation @xcite .",
    "this approach generically predicts collectively pinned elastic media to exhibit a highly nonlinear @xmath19 , with a vanishing linear mobility , corresponding to transport activated over barriers that diverge with system size and vanishing drive .",
    "recently , in the case of random pinning , these scaling predictions have been put on firmer ground through a detailed dynamic functional renormalization group ( dfrg ) calculations of @xmath19 @xcite , which indeed predict @xmath20 , with a universal @xmath21 exponent . however , in the case of random pinning a number of technical problems with dfrg remain , precluding a fully controlled analysis @xcite .",
    "it turns out , however , that many problems of interest , such as surface growth @xcite , 2d colloidal crystals in periodic potentials @xcite , and vortices pinned by artificial dot arrays @xcite or by intrinsic pinning in e.g. , htsc , involve the considerably simpler but still nontrivial problem of _ periodic _ pinning .",
    "in addition to addressing numerous interesting physical problems , study of motion in a periodic potential provides a nice laboratory to explore new calculational methods .    a driven sine - gordon model is the simplest description of such periodic pinning problem , with an important simplifying feature of absence of topological defects such as dislocations or phase slips that can be important for understanding the dynamics of vortex arrays and cdw s @xcite .",
    "directly applicable to crystal growth phenomena , this model has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite . in equilibrium , among many other things , it describes the famous crystal surface roughening transition from the low - temperature smooth phase with bounded surface roughness to the high - temperature rough phase with logarithmic height correlations .",
    "one of the many interesting questions that naturally arises is : _ what are the signatures of the roughening transition in the driven transport  ? _ more specifically here we are interested in qualitative differences ( if any ) in @xmath19 above and below @xmath1 .",
    "the equilibrium limit of this question was addressed in the classic analysis of the equilibrium dynamics by chui and weeks @xcite and by nozires and gallet @xcite . by extending the standard analysis to equilibrium _",
    "dynamics _ they found the vanishing of the linear mobility below the roughening transition , consistent with the static picture of the smooth phase where the interface is pinned by the periodic potential .",
    "in the presence of an external drive , the sine - gordon model was studied sometime ago by hwa , kardar , and paczuski @xcite and by rost and spohn @xcite .",
    "although these works led to considerable progress , computing the renormalization group ( rg ) flow equations for model parameters at nonzero @xmath3 , they concentrated mainly on the influence of kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) @xcite nonlinearities ( not considered in previous studies @xcite ) important at strong external drive , but said little about the actual @xmath19 characteristics of the driven interface in the @xmath22 creep regime .",
    "the driven sine - gordon model has also been considered by blatter et _ al .",
    "_ @xcite in a complementary approach via a high velocity perturbative expansion for @xmath19 .",
    "consistent with refs . and",
    ", these last authors found that while the correction @xmath23 remained finite above @xmath1 , it diverged below @xmath1 , thereby suggesting nontrivial transport changes across the roughening transition , but leaving the form of @xmath19 in the creep regime an open problem .",
    "of course , because at finite temperature the interface can move for any finite drive @xmath3 , at sufficiently long scales the periodic potential is averaged away at both low and high temperatures , thereby leading to the rounding of the roughening transition itself .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the velocity - force characteristics in the _ creep _ regime is controlled by the equilibrium physics and precise qualitative distinction of @xmath19 in the rough and smooth phases should exist @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "our goal is to understand in detail the physical consequences of the divergences found in the high - velocity perturbative expansion and in particular to compute the creep velocity - force characteristics in both phases and across the roughening transition , utilizing dynamic rg @xcite .",
    "consistent with perturbative analysis , we find that the nature of transport depends qualitatively on whether the temperature is above or below the equilibrium roughening transition temperature @xmath1 . above @xmath1 ,",
    "the velocity - force characteristics is ohmic , with the mobility remaining finite for @xmath24 .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath25 , we find that the linear mobility vanishes on long length scales , and therefore exhibits a nonuniversal jump discontinuity across the roughening transition @xcite . in the smooth phase ,",
    "the transport is a strongly nonlinear function of applied force , showing a rich universal crossover in temperature and applied force ( fig .",
    "[ fig_vfchar ] ) . at an intermediate drive @xmath26 , larger than the pinning ( @xmath27)- and temperature - dependent strong - coupling crossover force @xmath28 the velocity - force characteristics strongly depends on the level of proximity to @xmath1 , with : @xmath29",

    "while for weak pinning this computation is convergent for @xmath37 , it fails for arbitrarily weak pinning in the smooth phase . in section [ dynamicrg ]",
