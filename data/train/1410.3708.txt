    "the presence of these two features ( equatorial disc and large eccentricity ) enables the matter to accrete onto the neutron star directly from the equatorial be - star disc during its orbital motion near the periastron passage .",

    "the persistent x - ray luminosity between outbursts clearly indicates that accretion does not stop during the orbital motion of the neutron star even at the orbit apastron . while it is possible to produce a spin - down torque during low - luminosity disc accretion , for example in models",
    "@xcite , it is difficult to reconcile the observed 275-s neutron star period with these models , even by assuming that most of the time the accretion rate is as low as @xmath111 .",
    "indeed , the equilibrium period in the sophisticated model by @xcite is @xmath112 \\dot m_{18}^{-3/7}b_9^{6/7}\\approx 83 $ ]  s for parameters of gx304 - 1 @xmath113 and @xmath114 , more than three times as short as observed .",
    "( incidentally , we stress here the general problem of explaining the observed long periods of x - ray pulsars in bexrb systems in the frame of the standard disc accretion onto neutron stars with the standard magnetic field about @xmath115  g ; quasi - spherical settling wind accretion does not have this problem , see @xcite ) .    thus we conclude that the quasi - spherical settling accretion onto the slowly rotating neutron star with standard magnetic field from stellar wind of the companion be - star seems to be a likely explanation to the observed spin - down between type i outbursts in gx304 - 1 .",
    "the angular momentum from the neutron star is removed due to interaction of the magnetosphere with convective hot shell formed from the matter with low angular momentum captured from the quasi - spherical low - velocity wind of the be - star .",
    "the be - disc can be inclined to the binary orbital plane due to the natal kick acquired by the neutron star during supernova explosion .",
    "when the radius of the circumstellar disc is smaller or comparable with the periastron distance , a single - peak type i outburst occurs near the orbital periastron passage . when the radius of the be - disc increases above the orbital periastron distance , a double - peak outburst near the periastron can be produced , with the second ( post - periastron ) peak being at the more effective quasi - spherical bondi accretion stage from the stellar wind of be - star .",
    "the lower spin - up rate during the second flare can be explained by lower value of the specific angular momentum of matter captured from the quasi - spherical wind from the be - star by the neutron star moving in elliptical orbit .",
    "once the orbital parameters of gx304 - 1 will be determined , the orbital phase of the precursor and post - periastron flares in double - peak outbursts can be used to find the be - disc node line angle .",
    "further optical and x - ray observations of the system are encouraged to disentangle the complicated structure of the be - star wind and to check the proposed model for x - ray outbursts .",
