    "a bilinear map is a function of two variables that belong to two finite abelian groups , and with values in another abelian group , such that when fixing one of its variable the map thus obtained is a homomorphism of groups .",
    "bilinear maps were originally introduced in cryptography in order to solve the discrete logarithm problem  @xcite . due to bilinearity it is possible to transport this problem from a group for which it is assumed to be difficult to another one where the problem becomes easier .",
    "afterwards , bilinear maps were used to define tripartite diffie - hellman key exchange protocol  @xcite . in these two situations ,",
    "the bilinear maps under consideration are assumed to be non - degenerate , and are called pairings . for such a map",
    "@xmath2 , this means that apart from the identity element of @xmath1 ( respectively , @xmath3 ) , there is no members of @xmath1 ( respectively , of @xmath3 ) that annihilate every member of @xmath3 ( respectively , of @xmath1 ) . for these kinds of use",
    "the groups @xmath4 are cyclic groups .",
    "many pairings considered in the literature are naturally associated to some objects arising in algebraic ( projective ) geometry such as elliptic curves and more generally abelian varieties . for a long time pairings were variants of the weil  @xcite and tate  @xcite pairings over genus @xmath5 or @xmath6 curves over finite fields .",
    "more recently pairings over more general abelian varieties have been proposed  @xcite and even based on dot - products  @xcite for homomorphic encryption .",
    "more attention was given to pairings over elliptic curves for at least two reasons .",
    "first of all , it seems that the security level of such pairings with respect to the discrete logarithm problem and to pairing inversions is high ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "secondly , these pairings may be computed rather efficiently ( with help of an efficient finite field arithmetic  @xcite or by optimized versions of miller s algorithm  @xcite ) .",
    "apart from these two important cryptographic issues , pairings are bilinear maps between finite abelian groups , and as any bilinear map , a pairing descends to the tensor product of abelian groups as a usual group homomorphism .",
    "it seems rather natural to study pairings through the notion of tensor product , and it is the point of view adopted in this contribution .",
    "more precisely , we study , and construct , bilinear maps between finite abelian groups ( and more generally between modules over some fixed ring ) seen as homomorphisms from a tensor product to an abelian group ( or a module ) .",
    "this provides an elliptic curve free presentation of pairings between abstract groups .",
    "not all our results are difficult , some of them are folklore , and lot of them may even be qualified as simple for group - theorists , but we think that one of the main worth of this work is to provide a unified treatment of pairings in an abstract setting .",
    "this approach is quite natural since many properties of pairings are independent from algebraic geometry . because we have chosen to work at the abstract groups level",
    ", we do not deal with the cryptographic issues of efficiency and security .",
    "we believe that these gaps are balanced by the results stated in this contribution , and our rather general approach to pairings .",
    "we also believe that this work may serve as a basis for new constructions of cryptographically relevant pairings on other group structures than elliptic curves ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "the remainder of this contribution is organized as follows : section  [ basic ] fixes the general notations , provides basic definitions about bilinear maps and pairings , and contains a brief overview on pairing - based cryptography .",
    "section  [ tensorprod ] is about the tensor product of groups and modules themselves , of which it provides a number of useful properties .",
    "section  [ finiteabgroups ] is entirely devoted to the tensor product of finite abelian groups : the rules to compute any such tensor product are presented .",
    "it also deals with the canonical bilinear map ( which is canonically attached to a tensor product ) and the fact that non - degeneracy of a bilinear map depends of that of a canonical bilinear map .",
    "section  [ constructions ] contains several constructions of pairings .",
    "some properties about known pairings are also recovered .",

    "<S> pairings are particular bilinear maps , and as any bilinear maps they factor through the tensor product as group homomorphisms . besides , nothing seems to prevent us to construct pairings on other abelian groups than elliptic curves or more general abelian varieties . </S>",
    "<S> the point of view adopted in this contribution is based on these two observations . </S>",
    "<S> thus we present an elliptic curve free study of pairings which is essentially based on tensor products of abelian groups ( or modules ) . </S>",
    "<S> tensor products of abelian groups are even explicitly computed under finiteness conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal that the existence of pairings depends on the non - degeneracy of some universal bilinear map , called the canonical bilinear map . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it is shown that the construction of a pairing on @xmath0 is always possible whatever a finite abelian group @xmath1 is . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose some new constructions of pairings , one of them being based on the notion of group duality which is related to the concept of non - degeneracy . </S>",
