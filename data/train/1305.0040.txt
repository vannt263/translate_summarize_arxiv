    "as in schnbucher ( 2003 ) , in the following we refer to a cds as a stylized transaction with a simplified payoff , in particular    * we ignore the mismatch between the default and the settlement times ; * we ignore the `` cheapest to deliver '' option ; * we assume that the cds is triggered by all and only the defaults of the issuer .",
    "moreover , we assume the same payment dates @xmath0 , @xmath1 for all the instruments that we will consider in the following .",
    "an asset swap is an interest rate swap in which the party that is long some bond ( and , by convention , the swap ) settles upfront the pull - to - par of the price of the bond , and pays the fixed coupon of the bond in exchange for the risk free rate ( we assume the euribor with the according tenor i.e. @xmath2 fixed at @xmath0 and payed at @xmath3 ) plus a spread .",
    "such spread is therefore equal to the difference , expressed in terms of the annuity , between the prices at inception of the equivalent risk - free and the risky bond .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    now , a portfolio like the one in figure [ fig1 ] , in which a bond is bought and financed with a repo transaction ( i.e.  the sale of protection without the need of extra liquidity ) and the interest rate risk is hedged by entering the asset swap , seems a good candidate to replicate the sale of a cds , if one takes into account that the portfolio must be unwound immediately after the default of the issuer . in other words",
    ", it seems that the following no - arbitrage relationship holds : @xmath4 however , this formula is only an approximation .",
    "indeed , it easy to see that the only way to match all the cashflows both on survival and on default of the issuer is to include in the asset swap an early termination clause triggered by the default of the issuer , with a close out amount equal to zero .",
    "if this clause is not included , the unwind of the asset swap will imply a non - replicable cashflow equal to @xmath5 i.e.  the mark - to - market on the time of default , as shown in table [ tab1 ] .",
    ".cashflows of the candidate replica portfolio vs the cds [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have introduced a cds replica strategy that involves an asset swap equipped with an early termination clause triggered by the default of the issuer .",
    "the resulting formula defines an asset swap par spread that takes into account such clause , which present value formally resembles a unilateral credit / debit valuation adjustments ( it is the difference between a unilateral dva and a unilateral cva both computed with the default probability of the issuer , see eq .  [ upfront ] ) .",
    "the results obtained above may be applied when addressing the risks related to a structured repo ( a banking book transaction elsewhere called term repo , or repo to maturity ) or to compute a standard repo or reverse repo spread implied by other market observables like cds spread , asset swap spread and default probabilities .",
    "in fact , we observe that ( [ arbc ] ) implies , for repo or reverse repo to maturity : @xmath6",
