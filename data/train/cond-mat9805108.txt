    "the optical spectra of metals in the infrared ( ir ) spectral region depend sensitively on the interaction between electrons and phonons .",
    "deviations from the theoretical spectrum without any phonon contribution stem from the so  called holstein mechanism @xcite in which the incident photon is absorbed in a second  order process involving creation of both a phonon and an electron  hole pair .",
    "the detailed description of this mechanism was given by allen @xcite . despite the fact",
    "that the physical mechanism of electron  phonon coupling is rather well understood for almost three decades , little process was made in the systematic experimental study of coupling effects in optical ( ir ) spectra @xcite , nor has the phenomenology been explored beyond the lowest order effects .",
    "the lack of systematic experimental investigations appears to be related to the following two reasons :    firstly , historically measurements of optical spectra of metals where limited to photon energies @xmath10 ev @xcite .",
    "we shall argue in this paper that the effects of the electron ",
    "phonon interaction on the optical spectra of ordinary metals are rather weak at these energies .",
    "the optical conductivity in this spectral range can usually be described in the framework of the drude formula @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the relaxation rate of electrons due to their interaction with impurities and phonons .",
    "it can be calculated using the commonly adapted bloch  grneisen  type formula .",
    "secondly , the measurements of the optical conductivity are complicated in ordinary metals by the anomalous skin effect which is mostly present at low temperatures and in the far  infrared ( fir ) spectral region .",
    "it leads to serious difficulties in the interpretation of reflectivity and absorbtivity measurements .",
    "only a few observations @xcite are known to us where holstein processes where identified in the normal state of ordinary metals .",
    "the discovery of the high - t@xmath13 superconductors ( htsc ) has dramatically changed the experimental situation .",
    "first of all , the experimental methods were improved radically by extending the accessible energy range down to @xmath14 @xmath15 and by increasing the accuracy of the measurements .",
    "secondly , it appears that htsc systems allow the observation of the electron ",
    "phonon interaction in the optical spectra more easily and more clearly than it was possible in the ordinary metals .",
    "thirdly , there is no anomalous skin effect in these systems for light with electric field parallel to the cu  o planes .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to review the theoretical situation .",
    "we then extend the treatment of the frhlich hamiltonian to include vortex corrections .",
    "theoretical predictions are then compared with experimental observations following earlier attempts to connect the ir reflectivity and absorption spectra of htscs with features of strongly interacting electron ",
    "phonon systems @xcite .",
    "we shall show that most but not all observations can be described rather well within such a scheme and identify some pertinent open questions .",
    "we start from the description of metals with electron  phonon interaction by the standard frhlich hamiltonian @xmath16 here",
    "the first term is the kinetic energy of an electron with given momentum @xmath17 and band index @xmath18 , the last term is the energy of the phonon with momentum @xmath19 and mode @xmath9 .",
    "the second term represents the electron ",
    "phonon interaction , where @xmath20 is the matrix element of this interaction .",
    "the use of this hamiltonian for the self  consistent calculation of the electron and phonon green s functions can not be rigourously justified in the general case .",
    "it was shown @xcite that this hamiltonian can be used for the calculation of the influence of the electron ",
    "phonon interaction on the electronic properties for systems where no low  energy collective excitations of electrons are present .",
    "principle calculations @xcite of the physical properties of a number of ordinary metals have shown that the frhlich hamiltonian is a very good starting point for the analysis of all features related to electron  phonon interactions . in htsc materials we can not expect this hamiltonian to describe the optical response completely because additional low energy excitations ( e.g.  spin and/or charge excitations ) occur . however , these excitations contribute little to the general trend of the `` anomalous '' optical properties of htsc systems at high energies and are simply ignored in this study .",
    "the question we wish to answer here is the following : to what extend can observed optical spectra in the normal state be understood in terms of the most simple model of electron ",
    "phonon interaction as represented by equation ( [ froehlich ] ) .",
    "body electron  phonon interaction are usually calculated by green s function method @xcite .",
    "let us introduce the electron and phonon one  particle thermodynamic green s functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 the wick operator @xmath23 reorders the operators following it in such a way that @xmath24 increases from right to left . for non",
    " interacting particles the fourier components of the green s functions , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , have the very simple form @xmath27 and @xmath28 here @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the matsubara frequencies for fermions and bosons , respectively , and @xmath31 is the temperature .",
    "the value @xmath32 is the electron band energy and , correspondingly , @xmath33 is the phonon energy for the @xmath9th mode . in the following",
    "we do not consider the renormalisation of the phonon green s function due to the electron ",
    "phonon interaction . for convenience",
    "we present the phonon function @xmath26 in the spectral form @xmath34 for the non  interacting case the spectral density @xmath35 has the form @xmath36 in the following we tread the spectral function @xmath35 as an experimental quantity and calculate the influence of the electron ",

    "these properties are reflected in the one  particle electron green s function and the optical conductivity @xmath37 . the one  particle green s function for electrons in the presence of the electron ",
    "phonon interaction @xcite can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the electron self  energy part .",

    "figure [ fig10 ] shows the behaviour of the transport relaxation rate @xmath170 obtained for ybco at temperatures @xmath206 k. it well resembles the usual shape of such curves in htsc and might be compared to fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the relaxation rate for bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath215 was derived from the conductivity using the `` extended '' drude formula .",
    "it was also shown there that the behaviour of the relaxation rate @xmath170 can not be explained in the framework of marginal fermi liquid theory @xcite , since @xmath170 saturates at energies @xmath216 @xmath15 whereas according to marginal fermi liquid theory the relaxation rate should continue in a straight line .",
    "this argument was used in ref .",
    "@xcite as evidence against the one  component approach to the optical spectra of htsc systems .",
    "however , the saturating behaviour for @xmath170 can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , at nearly the same energy as it was observed in bi@xmath2sr@xmath2cacu@xmath2o@xmath215 .",
    "figure [ fig11 ] shows the calculated resistivity for ybco , demonstrating clearly a linear temperature dependence over a large temperature interval .    to conclude this considerations",
    ", we would like to discuss shortly the possibility of inverting reflectivity data to obtain the transport spectral function @xmath185 .",
    "this has been done for lead at @xmath155 @xcite , where the the infrared data was obtained by applying a magnetic field to drive the system into the normal state . there , a spectral function with detailed structure could be obtained . in htsc systems",
    "the situation is more complex .",
    "the superconducting state exists up to considerably high temperatures @xmath217 and can not be suppressed by magnetic fields to allow ir measurements at @xmath155 . at finite temperature",
    "the inversion procedure is far more difficult and as a result such calculations only yield the rough overall form of the transport spectral function .",
    "nevertheless , the resulting @xmath185 clearly resemble the phonon spectra of these systems @xcite .",
    "the results obtained in this work demonstrate clearly , that strong electron ",
    "phonon interaction , combined with band structure calculations , describe the overall behaviour of the optical spectra and the main part of the transport properties of htsc in a straightforward manner .",
    "however , we do not claim that this simple quasi ",
    "isotropic approach can explain all details of the behaviour of htsc systems , even in the normal state , and even at optimal doping .",
    "there are a number of open problems concerning the behaviour of the hall coefficient , the nmr relaxation rate of the copper sites .",
    "we would like to point out the existence of at least two relaxation rates in the htsc systems , namely the quasi ",
    "particle relaxation rate @xmath178 and the transport @xmath170 which are very different over a large energy range .",
    "we can not rule out that the relaxation rate involved in the hall current , due to strong and possibly anisotropic electron  phonon interaction , will be different from the transport relaxation rate in those systems .",
    "this could lead to the observed temperature dependence of the hall coefficient .",
    "last but not least , we should point out that the simple approach presented here does not work at low temperatures",
    ". it can not properly describe the anisotropy of the superconducting order parameter , although it yields the correct order of magnitude for the value of @xmath218 .",
    "there are additional phenomena besides electron  phonon coupling which become important at low temperatures .",
    "there are a number of different models which combine a strong electron ",
    "phonon interaction with interband coulomb interaction , with the existence of a van hove singularity in the electron spectrum , etc .",
    ", of which a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this work .",
