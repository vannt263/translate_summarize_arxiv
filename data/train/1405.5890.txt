    "[ tbl : results ] presents the beam specifications required by awake witness beam and the values that can be delivered by modified - phin photo - injector . according to the simulation results",
    "phin photo - injector can be tuned to provide all specifications required by awake project with the exception of the beam radius which can be further optimised by additional focusing .",
    "a systematic study was conducted in order to explore the possibility of adjusting the existing phin photo - injector in order to produce the electron beam required by the awake project to be used as the witness beam in the plasma wakefield acceleration scheme .",
    "the preliminary results are promising .",
    "therefore a further investigation is worthwhile such as rf phase and amplitude optimisation to maintain acceleration on the rf off - crest .",
    "operation under this condition can provide an energy chirp which might be used to compress the bunch .",
    "furthermore , optimum integration of the accelerating structure should be determined considering engineering and beam dynamics specifications .",
    "focusing elements should be implemented into the setup which will lead re - optimisation of the laser parameters .",
