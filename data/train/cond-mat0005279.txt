    "cylinders made of materials with layered structure and multiwall carbon nanotubes are the examples of systems with 2d conduction .",
    "the properties of quasi-1d mesoscopic rings and 2d cylinders in the presence of a static magnetic field are well known @xcite .",

    "however short - range disorder with small number of rings with reversed currents is not excluded .    in order to get such long - range stable domains",

    "the systems considered by us in the previous section were 2d systems and they should be described by a 2d ising model which has a phase transition to an ordered state in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "such consideration will be a subject of our further work .",
    "in the presented paper we discussed some aspects of quantum coherence in mesoscopic systems .",

    "what is more , if the magnetic response is sufficiently large one should account also for the field produced by the orbital currents and solve the entire problem self - consistently .",
    "+ to treat this problem we considered the long - range magnetostatic interaction . performing the smfa we arrived at the effective hamiltonian , valid both in systems with quasi-1d and 2d conduction which leads to self - consistent equations for the current .    the self - sustaining solutions ( at @xmath123 ) for samples exhibiting paramagnetic behavior at low @xmath67 are spontaneous currents manifesting a break of time reversal symmetry .",

    "+ the self - sustaining currents present in mesoscopic systems with low - dimensional conduction , are a hallmark of a quantum coherence .",
    "the amount of coherent electrons running persistent currents is very sensitive to the shape of the fs .",
    "the most favorable situation is for the system with flat fs where the correlation of currents from different channels is the strongest .",

    "we have discussed the effective long - range order for large but finite systems .",
    "we calculated the temperature @xmath0 below which the system is completly ordered in a sense that the correlation range extends over its length .",
    "most of the theorems discussing lro are valid only in the thermodynamic limit .",
