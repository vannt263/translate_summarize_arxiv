    "a common feature of all current and future cmb experiments is that contamination of the cmb signal by foreground components must be dealt with .",
    "the most important contaminants over the frequency range of interest for the cmb are the effects of discrete radio and sub - mm sources , and the effects of our own galaxy .",
    "discrete sources can in principle be discriminated against on the basis of their quite different angular size compared to the cmb fluctuations of interest . for galactic effects",
    "however , no such assumption can be made , and we must discriminate between them and cmb purely on the grounds of their differing behaviour with frequency .    in this context",
    "it is very important to have as good an estimate as we can of the likely level of galactic anisotropies , and to be armed with good algorithms for separating out their effects .",
    "this is an area which will see great development over the next few years as we prepare for the next generation of experiments , but as a preliminary effort in this direction we consider here , in schematic form , some recent estimates of galactic variation gathered using current cmb experiments and low frequency maps .",
    "data on a new type of discrete source whose spectrum can mimic a thermal source is also discussed . in the main part of the contribution , methods of performing the galactic frequency separation",
    "are briefly reviewed , and the good performance for this purpose of a maximum entropy algorithm allowing both positive and negative fluctuations is highlighted .",
    "it is difficult to use the low frequency 408 mhz @xcite and 1420 mhz @xcite maps to extrapolate galactic variations to cmb observing frequencies .",
    "the problems include difficulties with baselevels , scanning effects and of course with only two frequencies available only one spectral index can be estimated , whereas in principle the maps are mixtures of synchrotron and free - free emission , which have different spectral indices . as further problems , the synchrotron spectral index probably varies with frequency ( on physical grounds it is expected to steepen with increasing frequency ) , and the maps are of a limited resolution ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 at 408 and 1420 mhz respectively ) which makes it difficult to assess effects on scales below where the first doppler peak is expected to lie for cmb fluctuations in an inflationary picture .",
    "however , one thing we _ can _ use the low frequency maps for is to estimate the spatial power spectrum of high - latitude galactic variations , at least on angular scales above the point where scanning effects and/or the limited resolution become significant .",
    "[ fig : tenerife_408 ] and [ fig : tenerife_1420 ] ( prepared by m.p .",
    "hobson ) show the 1-dimensional spatial power spectra at 408 and    1420 mhz for a patch of sky which has been extensively sampled by the ` tenerife ' experiments .",
    "the section used is @xmath2 to @xmath3 in right ascension and @xmath4 to @xmath5 in declination .",
    "a hanning window has been applied and an overall mean subtracted .",
    "the spectrum is given in terms of spherical multipole @xmath6 and multiplied by @xmath7 , so that it can be directly compared to the usual plots of cmb power  in particular , a scale invariant spectrum would have zero slope on this plot .",
    "it has recently been suggested , on a number of grounds , that the galactic power spectrum behaves as @xmath8 as one approaches smaller angular scales @xcite .",
    "the observational basis of this for dust emission seems well established , but the plots presented here favour a slightly less steep index for synchrotron emission ( assuming this is the dominant component at 408 and 1420 mhz ) .",
    "in fact , the fall off at higher @xmath6 away from an @xmath9 scale - invariant behaviour , begins in both plots at an angular scale which corresponds to the effects one would expect given the limited resolution of the maps . in any case , these results make it clear that the galactic foreground problem will not get any _ worse _ compared to the cmb levels as one goes to higher resolutions , and this is encouraging for future experiments .",
    "the tenerife experiments constitute a suite of three instruments , operating at 10 , 15 and 33 ghz , on angular scales of @xmath10 , and are therefore potentially well - suited to providing an estimate of the galactic component on these scales .",
    "they were designed and built at jodrell bank @xcite and are operated by the iac in - situ on tenerife island .",
    "in fact , the level of anisotropy seen does not change very much in passing from 15 to 33 ghz @xcite and this makes it difficult to assess the galactic contribution , the implication being that the majority of the signal detected is cmb .",
    "however , we can set upper limits on the galactic contribution as follows . using the cobe dmr 2 year data and an assumed scale invariant cmb spectrum",
    ", we can predict a level of @xmath11 that should be the _ rms _ observed in the tenerife scans ( at all frequencies since the beam geometry is the same at each frequency ) .",
    "we can then estimate other contributions to the signal ( in particular the point source contribution ) and then subtract in quadrature from the _ observed _ _ rms _ in order to obtain a residual , which can be interpreted as an estimate of the galactic contribution .",
    "this process is shown in table  [ ta : results ] , with the result and 68% error bounds given in the    .breakdown of different contributions to the measured anisotropy in the tenerife experiments at 10 and 15 ghz . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     this suggests that the tenerife region ( approx 600 square degrees ) is @xmath12 times better than average over the @xmath13 sky .",
    "the availability of such large patches with relatively low galactic levels is encouraging for future ground - based and balloon experiments , especially when coupled with the conclusion that things get no worse as one moves down in angular scale from the tenerife / cobe scales .",
    "as mentioned above , discrete radio and sub - mm sources can be discriminated from cmb fluctuations via their quite different angular scale .",
    "this requires having higher resolution available than the resolution at which the cmb information is desired of course . as an example of",
    "how trying to eliminate radio sources using spectral information alone could go wrong , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : gips ] the    spectrum of the source rxj1459.9 + 3337 over the radio sub - mm region .",
    "( this figure and associated information were kindly provided by alistair edge . )",
    "the data are from multi - frequency vla observations taken in april 1996 and jcmt photometry in may 1996 .",
    "rxj1459.9 + 333 is a quasar that was discovered first in x - rays , and only later measured as a radio source . the spectrum ` turns over ' at a point somewhere",
    "between 20 and 40ghz , and on the rising side has a slope of @xmath14 , virtually indistinguishable from the cmb over this range .",
    "since the source was selected at x - ray , rather than on the basis of its radio properties , we do not how how rare such sources are  it would not have turned up in previous radio surveys .",
    "some indication of the frequency of occurrence of such sources may come from another such source , slightly weaker , which was found serendipitously in a search of @xmath15 square degrees in a rosat cluster field using the ryle telescope at 15ghz .",
    "one such source in each @xmath15 square degrees area would not pose a formidable threat to cmb astronomy , but shows that we do have to be on our guard for the unexpected .",
    "methods for separating foreground contamination from the cmb include pixel by pixel separation using least squares @xcite , marginalization @xcite , wiener filtering @xcite and maximum entropy methods ( mem ) @xcite . here",
    "we wish to consider particularly the use of 2-channel ( positive / negative ) maximum entropy , which can simultaneously achieve both deconvolution and frequency separation .",
    "the classical mem approach to combining observations , and removing the effects of a switched beam etc . , uses an assumption of positivity ( e.g. white and bunn @xcite ) .",
    "the cmb sky , however , apart from an unobservable monopole , has zero mean and is expected to fluctuate equally between positive and negative .",
    "white and bunn try to repair this by adding a positive constant to the data , but the need to include a default measure as well results in less space in which to reconstruct negative as opposed to positive features , and a consequent bias in the results .",
    "this may be verified by numerical simulations . instead",
    "2- channel mem may be used , in which positive and negative channels are reconstructed simultaneously .",
    "this has been shown to work well in deconvolution of switched beam data @xcite and avoids the problem with bias .",
    "recently , maisinger _",
    "@xcite have applied this technique to foreground / cmb separation using multifrequency data in the context of simulated interferometer observations , and the results below are taken from that paper .",
    "this method can be contrasted with that of wiener filtering .",
    "the latter provides the optimal linear method in the case that the power spectrum of the separate components is known .",
    "mem is a non - linear method , which does not rely on any assumption about the power spectra , but just that the skies it reconstructs have the smallest information content consistent with the actual data .",
    "the examples given in the following figures concentrate on the case of the vsa ( see jones , this volume ) .",
    "two channels of data are used , at 28 and 38 ghz , each with bandwidth 2 ghz , with observations made for @xmath16 12 hours at each frequency .",
    "[ fig : cmbhigh ] shows the true ( cdm ) sky used in the simulation on the right , and its mem reconstruction on the left .",
    "an important point which must be made is that the reconstruction can only be made within the sky area sampled by the telescope , and this is controlled by the circular primary beam .",
    "this is why the reconstruction fades to zero ( the default ) near the edges . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmbpower ] the power spectrum recovered from the reconstructed map is shown together with the real power spectrum and errors estimated by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the real power spectrum of course deviates from the underlying ensemble cmb power spectrum since only the realization corresponding to the single sky patch used is available .",
    "[ fig : wiencmb ] and [ fig : wiencmbpower ] show the same but for an implementation of the wiener filtering approach to this problem .",
    "note in each case ( mem and wiener ) , the true galactic frequency spectral index used in the simulations ( @xmath17 ) is assumed known by the algorithm .",
    "however , it is not too difficult to relax this assumption , for example by including _ two _ channels for frequency reconstruction , each with a different assumed spectral index , and letting the algorithms decide how much weight to give each channel .",
    "overall it can be seen that this application of mem is very successful , clearly outperforming the wiener method in this case .",
    "we are investigating its use for frequency based foreground / cmb separation in a variety of other contexts also .      0.4 cm f.r .",
