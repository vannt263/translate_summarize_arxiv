    "<S> we present a self - consistent theory for odd nuclei with exact blocking and particle number and angular momentum projection . </S>",
    "<S> the demanding treatment of the pairing correlations in a variation - after - projection approach as well as the explicit consideration of the triaxial deformation parameters in a projection after variation method , together with the use of the finite - range density - dependent gogny force , provides an excellent tool for the description of odd - even and even - even nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the theory to the magnesium isotopic chain and obtain an outstanding description of the ground - state properties , in particular binding energies , odd - even mass differences , mass radii and electromagnetic moments among others .    </S>",
    "<S> magnesium isotopes , binding energies , mass radii , magnetic moments , gcm , beyond mean field theories 21.10.-k , 23.20.lv , 21.10.re,21.60.ev    in the last years there has been an important development in the description of even - even nuclei with effective interactions , in particular with the skyrme , gogny and relativistic @xcite ones . </S>",
    "<S> the breakthrough has been possible by means of the beyond - mean - field theories ( bmft ) , namely by the recovery of the symmetries broken in the mean - field approach ( mfa ) and by the explicit consideration of large - amplitude fluctuations around the most probable mean - field values . </S>",
    "<S> the shape parameters @xmath0@xcite ( and pairing gaps @xcite ) were used as coordinates in the framework of the generator - coordinate method ( gcm ) and the particle - number ( pn ) and angular - momentum ( am ) symmetries were recovered by means of projectors . </S>",
    "<S> these developments are called symmetry - conserving configuration mixing ( sccm ) approaches and have been applied to even - even nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> methods based on the bohr collective hamiltonian have also made large progress lately @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> odd nuclei , on the other hand , are far more complicated to deal with . even at the mean - field level like in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) or bcs theories , </S>",
    "<S> odd nuclei are numerically cumbersome and to calculate ground states one must try several spins , parity , etc . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the blocked structure of the wave function entail the breaking of the time - reversal symmetry and triaxial calculations must be performed . </S>",
    "<S> the sccm developments have taken place for even - even nuclei and it seems natural to extend these approaches to odd - even and odd - odd nuclei . as a matter of fact angular - momentum projected calculations for odd - a nuclei started long ago , though they have been mostly performed on hf or hfb states in small valence spaces @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently a gcm mixing based on parity and am - projected slater determinants in a model space of antisymmetrized gaussian wave packets has been carried out in the frameworks of fermionic @xcite and antisymmetrized @xcite molecular dynamics . in the latter calculations , however , the pairing correlations are not treated properly . </S>",
    "<S> a first extension of bmft from even to odd nuclei with the skyrme force has been done recently in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this letter is to report on the first systematic description of the odd and even nuclei of an isotopic chain in a symmetry - conserving approach with the gogny force in a bmft considering the @xmath1 degrees of freedom explicitly and dealing optimally with the pairing correlations . </S>",
    "<S> our approach considers exact triaxial self - consistent blocking and exact particle number and angular momentum conservation . as an illustration of our approach we have chosen the magnesium isotopic chain for which there is abundant experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> basic properties like odd - even mass differences , magnetic and quadrupole moments as well as mass radii , among others , are investigated .    </S>",
    "<S> our starting approach is the hfb theory @xcite . as a mean - field approximation </S>",
    "<S> the hfb wave function @xmath2 is a product of quasi - particles @xmath3 defined by the general bogoliubov transformation @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the particle - creation and -annihilation operators in the reference basis , in our case the harmonic oscillator one . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the bogoliubov matrices to be determined by the ritz variational principle .    in our approach </S>",
    "<S> we have imposed three discrete self - consistent symmetries on our basis states @xmath8 : spatial parity , @xmath9 , simplex , @xmath10 and the @xmath11 symmetry , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 the time reversal operator . </S>",
    "<S> the first two symmetries provide good parity and simplex quantum numbers and the third allows to use only real quantities . </S>",
    "<S> the simplex symmetry furthermore allows to characterize the blocking structure of odd and even nuclei @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our basis is symmetrized in such a way that @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 the dimension of the configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> we use latin indices to distinguish the levels according to their simplex , @xmath17 for simplex @xmath18 and @xmath19 for simplex @xmath20 . the greek indices @xmath21 </S>",
    "<S> , on the other hand , do not distinguish simplex and run therefore over the whole configuration space . </S>",
    "<S> if we further assume that the intrinsic wave function is an eigenstate of the simplex operator , then , for a paired even - even nucleus half of the quasiparticle operators @xmath22 , have simplex @xmath18 and the other half have simplex @xmath20 , i.e. , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bogtrans ] ) separates in two blocks  : @xmath23 with @xmath24 in an obvious notation .    </S>",
    "<S> the wave function of the ground state of an even - even nucleus is given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 the particle vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle vacuum @xmath2 is obviously defined by @xmath27 the ground state of an even - even nucleus has simplex @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle excitations @xmath29 correspond to odd - even nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> they can be written as vacuum to the quasiparticle operators @xmath30 , @xmath31 the @xmath16 operators @xmath32 are obtained from the set @xmath33 by replacing the creation operator @xmath34 by the annihilation operator @xmath35 , the other @xmath36 operators remain unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> the simplex of the state @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 , where we have introduced the blocking number @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> it is @xmath40 if @xmath34 has simplex @xmath18 and @xmath41 if @xmath34 has simplex @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the unblocked wave function @xmath2 is vacuum to @xmath42 operators with simplex @xmath18 and to @xmath42 with simplex @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the blocked wave function @xmath43 is vacuum to @xmath44 operators @xmath45 with simplex @xmath18 and to @xmath46 operators @xmath47 with simplex @xmath20 . @xmath48 </S>",
    "<S> the matrices @xmath49 are rectangular with @xmath42 rows and @xmath50 or @xmath51 columns and according to the transformation @xmath52 , they are obtained , from the @xmath53 squared matrices @xmath54 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ bogtrans_simp ] ) by the corresponding columns exchange .    </S>",
    "<S> though the state @xmath43 has the right blocking structure , since the bogoliubov transformation mixes creator and annihilator operators and states with different angular momenta , @xmath43 is not an eigenstate of the pn or the am operators . as with even - even nuclei </S>",
    "<S> , to recover the particle - number symmetry one has to project to the right quantum numbers , see @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the _ </S>",
    "<S> easiest _ way would be to minimize the hfb energy , i.e. , determine @xmath55 and then perform the projections , i.e. the so - called projection - after - variation ( pav ) . </S>",
    "<S> the _ optimal _ </S>",
    "<S> way is to determine @xmath55 directly from the minimisation of the projected energy , i.e , the variation - after - projection ( vap ) method . from even - even nuclei </S>",
    "<S> one knows that pn - vap is feasible while am - vap is very cpu - time consuming . </S>",
    "<S> the approach of solving the pn - vap variational equation to find the self - consistent minimum and afterwards to perform an am - pav is not very good because the amp is not able to exploit any degree of freedom of the hfb transformation and self - consistency with respect to the amp is not guarantied . </S>",
    "<S> an intermediate way is to perform an approximate am - vap approach by solving the variational pn - vap equation for a large set of relevant physical situations as to cover the sensitive degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> afterwards an am - pav to this set of wave functions will determine the absolute minimum among these states for different angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> usually it is believed that the strongest energy dependence of the nuclear interaction is related to the deformation parameters @xmath0 and we will consider them as the additional degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> notice that this method guarantees , at least , am - vap self - consistency with respect to these relevant quantities . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in order to obtain a grid of wave functions we solve the pn - vap constrained equations @xmath56= \\frac { \\langle{\\tilde \\phi}^{}|\\hat{h}\\hat{p}^{n}|{\\tilde \\phi } { } \\rangle}{\\langle{\\tilde \\phi}^{}|\\hat{p}^{n}|{\\tilde \\phi}^ { } \\rangle } -   \\langle { \\tilde \\phi } |\\lambda_{q_{0}}\\hat{q}_{20 } + \\lambda_{q_{2 } }   \\hat{q}_{22 } | { \\tilde \\phi } \\rangle , \\label{e_lagr_bet - gam}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the lagrange multiplier @xmath57 and @xmath58 being determined by the constraints @xmath59 the relation between @xmath0 and @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 , @xmath62 with @xmath63 fm and @xmath64 the mass number .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the odd - even magnesium isotopes . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore consider wave functions of the form @xmath65 , we restrict ourselves to the neutron channels . </S>",
    "<S> notice that in the running product of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : odd_even_ansatz ] ) , orbitals with the same parity are occupied pairwise , therefore the parity , @xmath66 , of the state @xmath43 is given by the parity of the blocked level @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> one can furthermore block a state with positive or negative simplex , but since we do not break time reversal explicitly both possibilities are degenerated .    </S>",
    "<S> the minimization of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e_lagr_bet - gam]-[q0_q2_constr ] ) is performed with the conjugated - gradient method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the blocking structure of the wave function of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : odd_even_ansatz ] ) is a self - consistent symmetry and for a given blocking number we determine the lowest solution in the blocked channel compatible with the imposed constraints . </S>",
    "<S> that is , it does not matter which level is initially blocked , at the end of the iteration process the pn - vap energy and the hfb wave function are independent of this election . [ </S>",
    "<S> sect : pes ]    the next step is the simultaneous particle - number and angular - momentum projection ( pnamp ) of each state @xmath68 that conforms the @xmath0 grid , @xmath69 where the coefficients @xmath70 are variational parameters . </S>",
    "<S> they are determined by the energy minimization which provides a reduced hill - wheeler - griffin @xcite equation @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the hamiltonian and norm overlaps defined by @xmath74 the presence of the norm matrix in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hw_k ] ) is due to the non - orthogonality of the states @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hw_k ] ) is solved by standard techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notice that at each @xmath0 point one can have several eigenvalues @xmath76 labeled by @xmath77 , @xmath78 corresponds to the lowest solution .    the solution of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hw_k ] ) in the @xmath0 grid for different angular momenta and parity provides @xmath79 as a function of @xmath0 , @xmath80 , @xmath66 and @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> this energy can be written as @xmath81 which obviously represents the potential energy surface ( pes ) of the projected energy in the @xmath0 plane for the given quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> this projected pes differs from the usual mean field pes and are angular momentum @xmath82 , parity @xmath83 and state @xmath84 dependent . </S>",

    "<S> since the states @xmath75 are not orthogonal , the weights @xmath70 do not satisfy @xmath88 . the collective wave function @xmath89 on the other hand , does and can be interpreted as a probability amplitude .        in the calculations the intrinsic many body wave functions </S>",

    "<S> the theory line follows very closely the general behaviour of the experimental one . </S>",

    "<S> that an additional overbinding of 2.3 to 2.7 mev should be added to the results of the present calculations .    in this plot </S>",

    "<S> the small disagreement observed for the nuclei @xmath179 mg is probably related to the fact that proton - neutron pairing is not included in our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we find the largest discrepancy in @xmath180 mg corresponding to the @xmath181 case . for @xmath182 </S>",
    "<S> mg the disagreement is smaller and for @xmath172 mg , with the neutron 1d@xmath159 subshell closure , the p - n pairing looses relevance . in the @xmath183 case the excellent agreement is maintained but now with the exception of the isotopes @xmath184 mg for which the agreement is not as good as for the others . </S>",
    "<S> the small plateau found at @xmath185 is due to the behaviour observed at the top of the parabola in panel ( a ) .    in our approach </S>",
    "<S> the pairing correlations are treated specially well . </S>",
    "<S> first , the finite range density dependent gogny force used in the calculations is considered to be one of the best to describe pairing correlations and used as benchmark in many calculations . </S>",
    "<S> second , the use of the pn - vap approach avoids the pairing collapse in the weak pairing regime which is normally observed in the case of odd - even nuclei . and third , the coulomb anti - pairing effect ( cap ) is taken into account since all exchange terms of the force , in particular the coulomb ones , are considered in our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> a quantity which allows to extract information on the pairing energies from the experimental nuclear mass is the odd - even mass difference . in the three point approach </S>",

    "<S> for the lighter nuclei , in particular @xmath123 mg and @xmath190 mg , the theoretical results are a bit smaller , in absolute value , than the experimental ones . </S>",
    "<S> this is again a consequence of the mentioned absence of p - n pairing in our calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> another relevant quantity is the nuclear radius . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : radii ] the experimental mass radii @xcite corresponding to point mass nucleons are plotted together with the theoretical results . in the calculation of the mass radius we consider the one - body term of the center - of - mass correction . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results reproduce very well the overall experimental behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> one can distinguish three well differentiated regions . </S>",
    "<S> we first observe a rather flat behaviour of the mass radius for @xmath191 mg in which the increase of the neutron radius with filling the neutron 1d@xmath126 orbital is compensated by a compression of the charge distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this effect has been observed in the ne @xcite and in the mg isotopes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though with the filling of the 2s@xmath192 orbital one would expect an increase of the mass radius , it seems that the mentioned compensation persists also for @xmath137 mg . </S>",
    "<S> the second region corresponds to the nuclei @xmath193 mg , where we observe a clear increase of the mass radius associated with two neutrons in the 2s@xmath192 or 1d@xmath194 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the third region , for @xmath195 is marked by the beginning of the inversion island in @xmath145 mg @xcite and the rise in the mass radius observed for @xmath195 is associated with the increasing occupation of the 1f@xmath196 orbital .    ) . </S>",

    "<S> both values are somewhat smaller than the theoretical predictions 13.89 e@xmath197 and 22.47 e@xmath197 , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the schmidt value is @xmath200 and the experimental data are about half of it . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively good agreement of the schmidt with the experimental value for @xmath141 mg is probably due to the fact that this nucleus is the less deformed of all discussed isotopes . according to the occupation of the last nucleon @xmath145 </S>",
    "<S> mg should have the same schmidt magnetic moment as @xmath141 mg . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the latter the experimental value for @xmath145 mg , however , differs significantly from the schmidt value . this is probably due to the fact that @xmath145 mg is far more deformed ( @xmath201 ) than @xmath141 mg ( @xmath202 ) and therefore further away from the spherical limit . for @xmath149 </S>",
