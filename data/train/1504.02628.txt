    "piecewise polynomials or splines defined over triangulations form an indispensable tool in the sciences , with applications ranging from scattered data fitting to finding numerical solutions to partial differential equations .",

    "one often desires a low degree spline with @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath0 smoothness . for a general triangulation",
    ", it was shown in theorem  1.(ii ) of @xcite that the minimal degree of a triangular @xmath6 element is @xmath7 , e.g. , degrees @xmath8 for the classes @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath0 . to obtain smooth splines of lower degree",
    "one can split each triangle in the triangulation into several subtriangles .",
    "one such split is the powell - sabin 12-split @xmath9 of a triangle @xmath10 ; see figure [ fig : ps12 ] . on this split global @xmath4 smoothness can be obtained with degree only 2 @xcite , and @xmath5 smoothness with degree only @xmath11 @xcite on any ( planar ) triangulation .",
    "once a space is chosen one determines its dimension . the space @xmath12 and @xmath13 of @xmath4 quadratics and @xmath0 quintics on the 12-split of a single triangle have dimension 12 and 39 , respectively . for a general triangulation @xmath14 of a polygonal domain",
    ", we can replace each triangle in @xmath14 by its 12-split to obtain a triangulation @xmath15 .",
    "the dimensions of the corresponding @xmath4 quadratic and @xmath5 quintic spaces ( the latter with @xmath0 supersmoothness at the vertices of @xmath14 and interior edges of the 12-split of each triangle in @xmath14 ) are @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the number of vertices and edges in @xmath14 . moreover , in addition to giving @xmath4 and @xmath5 spaces on any triangulation these spaces are suitable for multiresolution analysis @xcite .    for a general smoothness , degree , and triangulation , it is a hard problem to find a basis of the corresponding spline space with all the usual properties of the univariate b - spline basis .",
    "one reason is that it is difficult to find a single recipe for the various valences and topologies of the triangulations . in @xcite a basis , called the ( quadratic ) s - basis ,",
    "was constructed for the @xmath4 quadratics on the powell - sabin 12-split on one triangle .",
    "the s - basis consists of simplex splines @xcite and has all the usual properties of univariate b - splines , including a recurrence relation down to piecewise linear polynomials and a marsden identity .",
    "moreover , analogous to the bernstein - bzier case , @xmath3 and @xmath4 smoothness conditions were given tying the s - bases on neighboring triangles together to give @xmath4 smoothness on the refined triangulation @xmath15 .",
    "in the remainder of the next section we recall some background on splines and the 12-split .",
    "section [ sec : dimensionformula ] introduces dimension formulas for spline spaces on the 12-split . in the next section some basic properties of simplex splines",
    "are recalled , after which an exhaustive list is derived of the @xmath0 quintic simplex splines on the 12-split that reduce to a b - spline on the boundary .",

    "the concise and coordinate independent form of the barycentric marsden identity makes it possible to state these results in table [ tab : dualpolynomials ] .",

    "one of the latter smoothness conditions involves just the control points in a single triangle and the geometry of the neighboring triangles , showing that @xmath0 smoothness using @xmath13 can not be achieved on a general refined triangulation @xmath15 .",
