    "observations by astronomers over the past fifteen years have suggested that the universe is dominated by an unexpected component known as `` dark energy '' , yet we still have no physical understanding of its existence or magnitude . determining the nature of dark energy is one of the most important challenges for contemporary cosmology because its presence implies that our understanding of the physics of the universe is incomplete .",
    "possible explanations are that the theory of general relativity must be modified on cosmological scales to generate an effective repulsive gravitational force , the universe is filled with a diffuse material that acts with an effective negative pressure , or our interpretation of cosmological observations must be changed to reflect inhomogeneities .",
    "one of the most important consequences of the first two scenarios is that the universe underwent a transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion within the last few billion years . in this paper",
    "we use new observations and methods to map this expansion history in a model - independent , non - parametric and robust manner .",
    "we do assume cosmic homogeneity in our data analysis , and therefore we do not address the third scenario .    in the standard cosmological analyses , involving datasets such as distant supernovae ( riess et al .",

    "2011b ) and the cosmic microwave background radiation ( komatsu et al .",
    "2011 ) , the expansion rate of the universe at different look - back times is not measured directly .",
    "accelerating expansion is a _ model - dependent implication of fitting cosmological data with parametric models _ in which prior assumptions are made about the physical components of the universe and their evolution with redshift .",
    "however , the unknown physical nature of dark energy implies that we can not yet be certain that any particular parametric model is correct .",
    "for example , measurements of distant supernovae provide some of the strongest evidence for the existence of dark energy .",
    "the observed quantities are the apparent magnitudes of the supernovae , which yield a relative luminosity distance as a function of redshift , i.e.  @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the luminosity distance , @xmath5 is the local value of the hubble expansion rate and @xmath6 is the speed of light .",
    "these supernovae distances are well - fit by a model in which the physical contents of the universe are divided into pressureless matter with a current fractional energy density @xmath7 , which dilutes with redshift as @xmath8 , and a `` cosmological constant '' @xmath9 whose energy density does not change with redshift . the best - fitting parameters assuming this model are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , implying a transition from decelerating to accelerating expansion at @xmath12 ( e.g.  conley et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "however , this conclusion is dependent on the assumed parameterized model .",
    "the acceleration of the expansion rate is not directly observed . when the supernovae data are subject to model - independent _ non - parametric analysis _",
    ", the evidence for accelerating expansion is much weaker ( wang & tegmark 2005 , shapiro & turner 2006 , shafieloo 2007 , sollerman et al .",
    "2009 , shafieloo & clarkson 2010 ) .",
    "this is primarily because the acceleration rate is obtained as the second derivative of the noisy observed luminosity distances . moreover , obtaining the cosmic expansion rate from a luminosity distance requires an additional assumption about spatial curvature .",
    "although recent cosmological data is consistent with a spatially - flat universe ( percival et al .",
    "2010 , komatsu et al .",
    "2011 ) , this conclusion is again reached within the assumption of a parameterized model ( unless we invoke a strong prior from inflationary cosmological models ) .",
    "the expansion history of the universe as a function of redshift @xmath13 is described by the evolution of the hubble parameter @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the cosmic scale factor at time @xmath16 . in this paper",
    "we present a new determination of the function @xmath17 using a two - step approach .",
    "firstly we apply an alcock - paczynski measurement ( alcock & paczynski 1979 ) to the large - scale clustering of galaxies in the wigglez dark energy survey ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2010 ) , thereby measuring the distortion parameter @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the physical angular - diameter distance .",
    "secondly we combine this measurement with the supernovae luminosity distances @xmath3 , using the equivalence of distance measurements @xmath20 , to infer the value of @xmath21 .",
    "the result is an accurate non - parametric reconstruction of the cosmic expansion history , which is independent of the assumed cosmological model ( including spatial curvature ) .",
    "we present our results in the form of both individual measurements of @xmath21 in four redshift bins within the redshift range @xmath2 , and a non - parametric reconstruction of a continuous cosmic expansion history using a modified version of the iterative methods introduced by shafieloo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "other methods for determining the hubble expansion rate have been previously attempted .",
    "firstly , @xmath17 may be inferred from the relative ages of passively - evolving galaxies ( stern et al .",
    "this is a promising technique although subject to many assumptions about the stellar populations and formation epochs of these galaxies .",
    "secondly , the imprint of baryon acoustic oscillations in galaxy clustering has been applied as a standard ruler along the line - of - sight ( gaztanaga , cabre & hui 2009 ) . however",
    ", the current availability of large - scale galaxy survey data restricts this latter technique to low redshift @xmath22 and it is debatable whether the signal - to - noise of current measurements is in fact sufficient to ensure a robust measurement ( kazin et al .",
    "finally , the physical presence of dark energy has been inferred from the late - time integrated sachs - wolfe effect which correlates low - redshift galaxy overdensities with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies ( giannantonio et al .",
    "however , this last technique does not allow recovery of the detailed expansion history and the achievable statistical significance is limited .    the alcock - paczynski test ( alcock & paczynski 1979 ) is a geometric probe of the cosmological model based on the comparison of the observed tangential and radial dimensions of objects which are assumed to be isotropic in the correct choice of model .",
    "it can be applied to the 2-point statistics of galaxy clustering if redshift - space distortions , the principal additional source of anisotropy , can be successfully modelled ( ballinger , peacock & heavens 1996 , matsubara & suto 1996 , matsubara 2000 , seo & eisenstein 2003 , simpson & peacock 2010 ) .",
    "this method has been previously utilized with data from the 2-degree field quasar survey ( outram et al .",
    "2004 ) , but the wigglez survey offers a superior measurement owing to the reduced importance of shot noise .",
    "chuang & wang ( 2011 ) recently performed fits to the tangential and radial clustering of luminous red galaxies within the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) at redshift @xmath22 , utilizing alcock - paczynski information .",
    "indeed , a general analysis of the tangential / radial galaxy clustering pattern in the presence of baryon acoustic oscillations demonstrates how the information may be divided into an overall scale distortion , quantified by a distance parameter @xmath23 , and a warping , quantified by the alcock - paczynski distortion factor @xmath24 , enabling the disentangling of @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( padmanabhan & white 2008 ; taruya , saito & nishimichi 2011 ; kazin , sanchez & blanton 2011 ) .",
    "such approaches are just becoming possible with the current generation of large - scale galaxy surveys , and will be very powerful when applied to future datasets such as the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss , eisenstein et al .",
    "another recent application of the alcock - paczynski test was presented by marinoni & buzzi ( 2010 ) , who presented a study of the distribution of close galaxy pairs .    the wigglez dark energy survey ( drinkwater et al .",
    "2010 ) at the australian astronomical observatory has recently provided a new large - scale galaxy redshift survey dataset , allowing low - redshift cosmological measurements in the sdss to be extended to higher redshifts up to @xmath27 . in particular , the survey has yielded a measurement of the baryon acoustic peak in the clustering pattern at @xmath28 ( blake et al .",
    "in addition , blake et al .",
    "( 2011a ) mapped the growth of cosmic structure in this dataset across the redshift range @xmath2 for a fixed background cosmological model .",
    "the new study presented in this paper constitutes a generalization of that analysis incorporating alcock - paczynski distortions arising in varying cosmological models .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in section [ secwigglez ] we introduce the wigglez survey dataset and power spectrum measurements . in section [ secap ]",
    "we describe our implementation of the alcock - paczynski test and our model for marginalizing over redshift - space distortions . in section [ secapsn ]",

    "we measured galaxy power spectra in six independent survey regions , dividing each region into four redshift slices . at a given redshift we fitted models to the measurements in each different survey region , convolving with the respective survey window function .    in order to measure the power spectrum and calculate this convolution we need to define the selection function of the survey which describes the mean galaxy density as a function of position",
    "the angular and redshift dependences of the selection function for each wigglez region were determined using the methods described by blake et al .",
    "this process models several effects including the variation of the galex target density with dust and exposure time , the incompleteness in the current redshift catalogue , the variation of that incompleteness imprinted across each 2-degree field by constraints on the positioning of fibres and throughput variations with fibre position , and the dependence of the galaxy redshift distribution on optical magnitude .",
    "the galaxy power spectrum was then measured using the optimal - weighting scheme proposed by feldman , kaiser & peacock ( 1994 ) .",
    "our fiducial cosmological model which we use to convert redshifts and angular co - ordinates to distances is a flat @xmath43cdm model with matter density @xmath44 .",
    "we therefore assume cosmic homogeneity in our data analysis .    because the wigglez survey consists of a series of independent narrow - angle cones ( of width @xmath45 degrees on the sky ) a `` flat - sky '' approximation may be used in which the co - ordinate @xmath46-axis is aligned with the line - of - sight at the centre of each region ; the wavevector components @xmath47 are then deduced from the three - dimensional fourier vector @xmath48 as @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "given that the normalization of the supernova hubble diagram @xmath149 is treated as an unknown parameter , the supernovae data yields the relative luminosity distance @xmath3 .",

    "the supernovae data points and best - fitting 3rd - order polynomial model are displayed in figure [ figdasn ] .",
    "this model provides a good fit to the data , with a chi - squared statistic of @xmath154 for @xmath155 degrees of freedom .    combining the alcock - paczynski and supernovae measurements in the four redshift slices we find that @xmath156 \\equiv \\dot{a}/\\dot{a}_0 = ( 1.11 \\pm 0.17 , 0.83 \\pm 0.13 , 0.81 \\pm 0.08 , 0.83 \\pm 0.10)$ ] where @xmath157 . these results are plotted as the black error bars in figure [ figadotmeas ] and compared to three expansion history models : a @xmath43cdm cosmology with matter density @xmath44 , an einstein - de - sitter ( eds ) model with @xmath158 and a `` coasting '' model for which @xmath159 at all times .",

    "this is directly observed in our data : if we fit for a constant value of @xmath161 we find that the range @xmath162 , containing accelerating - expansion models , contains @xmath163 of the probability .",
    "hence in this assessment , accelerating - expansion models are preferred with a statistical significance of more than 3-@xmath164 .",
    "we stress that this is a non - parametric result , insensitive to the redshift - space distortion model adopted , based solely on combining alcock - paczynski measurements of @xmath165 with supernovae measurements of @xmath19",

    "the only parameter required by the method is the width of the smoothing kernel in redshift , @xmath167 ( our fiducial value is @xmath168 , other choices are considered below ) . for the initial guess model to commence the iteration , we chose a flat @xmath43cdm model with @xmath44 .",

    "the right - hand side of equation [ eqapiter ] is derived by expressing @xmath187 \\delta z'$ ] , substituting @xmath188 , and taking the derivative with respect to @xmath90 . at each step in the iteration we applied the residual distance correction for both the supernovae and alcock - paczynski data points , proceeding until the chi - squared statistic was minimized .",
    "we estimated the error in the distance - redshift reconstruction by repeating the iterative process using bootstrap re - samples of the datasets .",
    "the range of resulting distance - redshift curves across the re - samples defines the error in the reconstruction .",

    ", @xmath190 would evolve with redshift .",
    "finally , by a second differentiation of the distance - redshift curves we can obtain the deceleration parameter @xmath194 : @xmath195 the confidence ranges for the reconstruction of each quantity are established using bootstrap re - sampling .",
    "figure [ figadotrecon ] displays our non - parametric reconstructions of the four quantities @xmath19 , @xmath160 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "the light - grey regions display the @xmath196 confidence range of reconstructions using the supernovae data alone , and the inner dark - grey region derives from the combination of supernovae and alcock - paczynski measurements .    the addition of the alcock - paczynski data does not strongly enhance the reconstruction of the distance - redshift relation @xmath19 , which is very well - measured by supernovae alone .",
    "however , the direct sensitivity of @xmath182 to @xmath17 produces dramatic improvements in the reconstruction of the expansion - rate history , with a factor of 3 shrinking of the confidence ranges in @xmath17 for @xmath197 . at the four redshifts",
    "@xmath51 the reconstruction method gives us @xmath156 = ( 0.91 \\pm 0.02 , 0.88 \\pm 0.03 , 0.88 \\pm 0.08 , 0.80 \\pm 0.08)$ ] .",
    "these measurements are correlated , but the level of correlation is low because the fiducial choice of the smoothing length @xmath168 is somewhat smaller than the bin width @xmath37 .    our measurements establish the constancy of @xmath190 with redshift for the first time with reasonable precision , a key prediction of a flat @xmath43cdm model .",
    "at the four redshifts listed above the reconstruction method produces @xmath198 .",
    "if we fit these values for the matter density in a flat @xmath43cdm model we find @xmath199 , consistent with fits to the cmb radiation ( komatsu et al .  2011 ) .",
    "we also overplot in figure [ figadotmeas ] the non - parametric measurements of @xmath160 obtained by this reconstruction method in the four redshift slices .",
    "comparison of the errors with the direct combination of supernovae distances and alcock - paczynski data shows that at low redshift the supernovae data alone place the most powerful constraint on the expansion history , greatly improving the results presented in section [ secapsn ] , but at higher redshifts the alcock - paczynski data are crucial in order to obtain accurate measurements .",
    "figure [ figreconsmooth ] illustrates the effect of changing the smoothing length on the reconstructed expansion history @xmath161 , considering values @xmath200 and @xmath201 . a flat @xmath43cdm model with @xmath44 , shown as the solid line , continues to be a good description of the expansion history regardless of the smoothing scale .",
    "we checked that the error in fitting @xmath7 to these data was insensitive to @xmath167 when covariances between different redshifts were taken into account ( estimating these covariances using the bootstrap resamples ) .",
    "we summarize our study as follows :    * we have performed joint fits for the alcock - paczynski scale distortion parameter @xmath68 and the normalized growth rate @xmath129 , using 2d power spectra measured from the wigglez dark energy survey in four redshift bins in the range @xmath2 .",
    "we can separate the contributions of alcock - paczynski and redshift - space distortions , and our result is insensitive to the range of models we examined for non - linear redshift - space effects when fitted to the wavenumber range @xmath202 mpc@xmath57 . * by combining the alcock - paczynski fits with luminosity - distance measurements using type ia supernovae , we determined the cosmic expansion rate @xmath192 $ ] in four redshift slices with @xmath0-@xmath1 accuracy .",
    "our results for redshifts @xmath51 are @xmath203 .",
    "these measurements are independent of spatial curvature . *",
    "our measurements show that the value of @xmath204 was lower at high redshift , demonstrating that the cosmic expansion has accelerated .",
    "if we fit for a constant value of @xmath204 in the redshift range @xmath2 we find that accelerating - expansion models are favoured with a statistical significance of more than 3-@xmath164 .",
    "* we used an adapted version of the reconstruction method of shafieloo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to model the continuous cosmic expansion history since @xmath27 using both the alcock - paczynski and supernovae datasets .",
    "the alcock - paczynski measurements enable a much more accurate determination of the expansion history than the supernovae data alone .",
    "we demonstrate that the quantity @xmath205 ^ 2 - 1\\}/[(1+z)^3 - 1]$ ] is constant with redshift , as expected in a spatially - flat @xmath43cdm model ; fitting for the value of this quantity allows us produce an estimate of the matter - density parameter @xmath199 , consistent with fits to the cmb radiation ( komatsu et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "we conclude that accelerating cosmic expansion can be recovered from cosmological data in a non - parametric manner and hence is a real physical phenomenon that must be accounted for by theory .",
    "our results are independent of the cosmological model adopted , although our data analysis assumes a homogeneous universe .",
    "the measured expansion history is well - fit by a cosmological constant which grows in relative importance with cosmic time .",
