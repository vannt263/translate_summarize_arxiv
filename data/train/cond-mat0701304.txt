    "<S> we have self - organized versatile magnetic nanowires , with variable period and adjustable magnetic anisotropy energy  ( mae ) . </S>",
    "<S> first , using the kinetic roughening of w(110 ) uniaxial templates of trenches were grown on commercial sapphire wafers . unlike most templates used for self - organization , those have a variable period , are demonstrated here . </S>",
    "<S> fe deposition then results in the formation of wires in the trenches . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of mae could be engineered up or down by changing the capping- or underlayer , in turn affecting the mean superparamagnetic temperature , raised to so far .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 in    0.5 in    the bottom - up approach is promising for the fabrication of nanostructures at moderate cost , with better resolution and less microscopic defects than with lithography . </S>",
    "<S> in epitaxial self - organization  ( so ) the building blocks are atoms that aggregate to each other during growth , a process that can be engineered to fabricate wires and dots with lateral dimensions from the micron size@xcite down to the atomic size@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the interest of so for fundamental research is often the narrow size dispersion@xcite , so that macroscopic measurements reveal the properties of one single nanostructure . </S>",
    "<S> issues like the increase of orbital momentum and magnetic anisotropy energy  ( mae ) at atomic edges or kinks have been addressed@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> concerning applications it is sometimes argued that so arrays could be used by addressing single nanostructures one by one , to store one bit of information for example . a more realistic view is the use of the array as a material with specific properties arising from the nanoscale . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case of semiconductor quantum dots with lasing properties@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> do magnetic so systems meet the requirements of applied materials ? </S>",
    "<S> a prerequisite is that some versatility of geometrical as well as physical properties is achieved , like tuning the magnitude of the mae . </S>",
    "<S> we focus here on the fabrication and properties of wires , which lie at the background of the fast - developing field of spin electronics making use of the propagation of domain walls in wires for storage or logics devices@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> so magnetic wires are often achieved by step - decoration of vicinal surfaces@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is not versatile as a new crystal has to be prepared with a specific miscut whenever the period needs to be changed . </S>",
    "<S> templates resulting from kinetic effects are potentially more versatile as the period can be changed with processing parameters , like temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this has been explored using ion etching under grazing incidence to create ripples on surfaces , independently of crystalline directions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however a significant control of the period has not been demonstrated so far . </S>",
    "<S> here we explore a new approach , based on the growth of body - centered - cubic ( 110 ) materials on nominally - flat saphir yielding parallel trenches with an adjustable period , which we then use to grow magnetic nanowires . </S>",
    "<S> we could tune the magnitude of the mae of the wires using suitably - chosen capping layers or underlayers . </S>",
    "<S> the use of commercial wafers while achieving some control on both the period and the mae represents a significant advancement in the versatility of so nanowires .    </S>",
    "<S> the samples were grown in a set of ultra - high vacuum chambers using pulsed - laser deposition with a nd - yag laser  ( @xmath0{nm}$ ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the chambers are equipped with a quartz microbalance , sample heating and a translating mask for the fabrication of wedge - shaped samples . </S>",
    "<S> a 10 kev reflection high energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) setup with a ccd camera synchronized with laser shots permits operation during deposition . an omicron room - temperature scanning tunneling microscope ( stm-1 ) and an auger electron spectrometer ( aes ) are available . </S>",
    "<S> the metallic films are grown on sapphire _ nominally - flat _ @xmath1 commercial wafers . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description of the chambers and growth procedures can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic measurements were performed ex - situ on -mo - capped samples , with a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer .    ordered arrays of wires were obtained in three steps , consisting of the fabrication of 1 .  a non - magnetic flat buffer layer ; 2 .  a non - magnetic template displaying a uniaxial array of trenches ; 3 .  fe wires by layer - by - layer deposition at the bottom of the trenches .    </S>",
    "<S> the first step is the preparation of a smooth buffer layer . a seed layer of mo ( nominal thickness @xmath2{nm}$ ] ) followed by w ( @xmath3{nm}$ ] ) </S>",
    "<S> are deposited on sapphire at room temperature ( rt ) followed by annealing at @xmath4c . </S>",
    "<S> this yields a @xmath5 surface of quality similar to that of metal single crystals , with atomically - flat terrasses of width up to hundreds of nanometers@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the second step consists of the preparation of a non - magnetic template . </S>",
    "<S> it was inspired by reports of the kinetic uniaxial roughening of films of the bcc elements fe(110)@xcite and w(110)@xcite during homoepitaxy at moderate temperature , explained by anisotropic diffusion along the steps and the occurrence of an ehrlich - schwoebel barrier . </S>",

    "<S> the stm cross - sections shown as insets reveal a depth of @xmath11 ( resp . ) . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the trenches can be probed using rheed with the electron beam along @xmath8 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the diffraction patterns consist of arrows whose half - angle reveals the slope of the microfacets . </S>",
    "<S> the arrows are much sharper for trenches of larger depth because the coherence length along the facets is increased . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to determine accurately the angle of the facets to @xmath12 , in perfect agreement with the triangular - like stm cross - sections of c. this angle is unambiguously ascribed to facets of type @xmath13 , with @xmath14 expected . </S>",
    "<S> the monitoring of rheed patterns during growth shows that @xmath15 is a stationary value , reached after a few nanometers of nominal thickness . </S>",
    "<S> the occurrence of a stationary angle garanties that the shape of the trenches is not influenced by fluctuations of the width of the trenches , and thus displays essentially no distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this is crucial as the dispersion of mae increases tremendously for nanosized systems in relation with the distribution of structural environments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a stationary angle was postulated in ref.@xcite , however the analysis concluded to facets of type @xmath16 with @xmath17 for w. the discrepancy may come from the fact that the leed patterns used in ref.@xcite were broad because trenches with a small period were studied . </S>",
    "<S> we could produce templates with the same facets for mo , nb , v and ta by deposition at room temperature .    </S>",

    "<S> we have used w templates , which remain perfectly stable up to @xmath19 . for templates of small period </S>",
    "<S> the surface gradually smoothes and becomes essentially flat for @xmath20(atomic layers ; not shown here ) . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the early stages of growth are easier to investigate for templates of large period . for these stm cross - sections </S>",
    "<S> reveal a flat level at the bottom of the trenches , suggesting a progressive filling and thus yielding fe wires with a triangular cross - section . </S>",

    "<S> the mean thickness and width of the wires are and , respectively , as deduced from stm .    for mo / fe / w wires the easy axis of magnetization lies in - the - plane along the wires , along [ 001]a . </S>",
    "<S> the mae is deduced from loops along [ 1@xmath230 ] like @xmath24{j / m^{3}}$ ] at @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 originates from the sum of several contributions , among which only the dipolar energy @xmath27 can be estimated reliably . </S>",
    "<S> other sources of mae are surface ( nel - type ) expected to favor the [ 1@xmath230 ] direction for the ( bottom ) fe / w interface@xcite and [ 001 ] for the ( top ) mo / fe interface@xcite , step - edge for fe / w , expected to favor [ 1@xmath230 ] @xcite ; magneto - elastic  unlike the case of thin films , here the large density of steps is expected to induce a significant out - of - plane mismatch and shear stress , so that no figure or even sign can be reliably predicted ; finally the bulk fe mae is negligible . </S>",

    "<S> first , the very same wires were fabricated after inserting a @xmath34-thick underlayer of mo on the w trenches . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic easy axis is again along the wires , however its magnitude is increased , which is consistent as fe / mo interfaces favor alignement of magnetization along @xmath8$]@xcite . </S>",
