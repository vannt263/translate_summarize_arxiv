    "can high - mass star formation be described as a scaled - up version of low - mass star formation ?",
    "protostellar jets and outflows are a ubiquitous feature of the star formation process ; as such , their study provides an important means of addressing this fundamental question .",
    "observationally , young stellar objects ( ysos ) of all masses are known to drive bipolar molecular outflows . if a single driving mechanism operates in both the low- and high - mass regimes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this would be evidence for a common formation process .",
    "the initial evidence for a single mechanism was an observed correlation , over five orders of magnitude , between bolometric luminosity and outflow force , power and mass flow rate ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "outflows observed towards massive young stellar objects ( mysos ) can contain momentum , mass and energy up to a few orders of magnitude larger ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) than outflows observed toward lower mass ysos ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a single outflow mechanism would imply that all stars acquire mass by a similar disc - accretion process that scales with source luminosity .",
    "however , outflows observed towards mysos were initially suggested to be less collimated than those identified towards low mass ysos ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , both @xcite and @xcite identified similar degrees of collimation towards the jets / outflows driven by young mysos as found in jets / outflows from low mass ysos . to account for both low and high degrees of collimation of massive outflows , @xcite proposed a scenario in which an initially well collimated jet / outflow de - collimates with time , eventually forming a wide angle wind .",
    "in the early formation stages outflows driven by mysos are potentially magnetically dominated and therefore highly collimated ( e.g. hh80/81 , @xcite ) . for more evolved mysos ,",
    "a radiatively driven stellar wind naturally gives rise to a less collimated outflow ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "intermediate - mass ysos ( 2 m@xmath6@xmath7 m@xmath88 m@xmath6 ) link the low- and high - mass regimes , and so have the potential to provide key insights into whether outflow properties scale smoothly with the mass of the driving ( proto)star .",
    "a complication is that intermediate and high - mass stars generally form in clustered environments @xcite ; as a result , it is not always unambiguously clear from observations which core(s ) in a region are powering the jet / outflow(s ) , particularly at lower spatial resolution .",
    "high angular resolution studies that can resolve individual cores and outflows are thus crucial to understanding jets / outflows from intermediate and high - mass stars .",
    "we targeted ngc 2264-c , one of the nearest intermediate / high - mass star forming regions in the red _ msx _ source ( rms ) survey @xcite , with the submillimeter array ( sma ) .",
    "the aim of these observations was to resolve the sio emission seen with the jcmt ( section  [ obs : jcmt ] ) , and so identify which source(s ) in the region are driving _ active _ outflows .",
    "a particular goal was to assess the relationship of the rms source to the outflows seen at low angular resolution , and so to aid in the interpretation of a large , low - resolution outflow survey of rms objects @xcite .",
    "located in the mon ob1 giant molecular cloud complex at a distance of 738@xmath9 pc @xcite , ngc-2264-c is a comparatively well - studied region , with a wealth of ancillary data and known co outflows .",
    "afgl 989-irs1 @xcite , a 9.5m@xmath6 b2 star , dominates the region in the ir .",
    "thirteen millimetre continuum sources have been identified ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure [ 0.04pc and masses ranging from @xmath02@xmath1040m@xmath6 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . from comparing observations and sph simulations ,",
    "@xcite suggest that ngc 2264-c is in a global state of collapse onto the central , most massive millimetre core , c - mm3 ( @xmath040m@xmath6 ) .",
    "@xcite observed @xmath4co(2 - 1 ) emission with the iram 30 m ( @xmath011@xmath1 resolution ) , detecting a network of 11 outflow lobes with projected velocities ranging from 10 - 30kms@xmath5 , lengths of 0.2 - 0.8 pc and momentum fluxes in the range 0.5@xmath1110@xmath12 to 50@xmath1110@xmath12m@xmath6kms@xmath5yr@xmath5 .",
    "however , the limited angular resolution meant that only a small minority of the detected outflow lobes could be unambiguously identified with driving sources ( millimetre continuum cores ) .",
    "subsequent high resolution sma observations by @xcite focusing on the central class 0 protostellar core , c - mm3 , identified a compact , young north - south bipolar outflow driven by this source in both @xmath4co and ch@xmath2oh emission , emphasising the power of high - resolution , multi - line observations .",
    "the ambiguity in identifying outflow driving sources based on low - resolution single - dish observations calls for high angular resolution observations of a reliable jet / outflow tracer .",
    "silicon monoxide ( sio ) emission is an effective tracer of jets / outflows from both low mass ysos ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and mysos ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . importantly , sio emission , unlike co , does not suffer from confusion with easily excited ambient material .",
    "co emission can also be easily excited in outflows , which may obscure the underlying effects ; it is possible for weak outflows to effectively be `` fossil '' momentum driven remnants even after the central driving engine declines ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , sio requires the passage of fast shocks to release it into the gas phase ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and thus is an excellent tracer of the fast shocks associated with an active outflow near the stellar driving source ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "we present the first high angular resolution study ( @xmath03@xmath1 resolution with the submillimeter array ) of sio ( 5 - 4 ) emission towards ngc 2264-c .",
    "the main goals of the sma observations are to identify _ active _ outflows and their central driving sources , and to determine the relationship of these active outflows to the multiple outflows previously reported based on single - dish observations of the region . in section 2",
    "we summarise the observations presented in this paper .",

    "we crudely estimate a bolometric luminosity for this source assuming that the luminosity ratio between the two sources ( e.g. l@xmath64/l@xmath65 ) is equal to the 1.3 mm flux density ratio .",
    "this gives an estimate of the bolometric luminosity for c - mm12 of between @xmath050 - 70l@xmath6 .",
    "the correlation between outflow force and source bolometric luminosity has been previously suggested as an indication of a similar outflow driving mechanism across the low and high mass star - forming regimes .",
    "figure [ ) , there is an order of magnitude scatter about these fits .",
    "the linear fit to the low mass class i sources @xcite , when extended to the high mass regime is found to better fit the data compared with the class 0 fit extended to the high mass regime .",
    "while both the class 0 and class i fits have a similar gradient @xcite , the class 0 fit is , on average , offset higher by an order of magnitude compared with the class i fit .",
    "sources observed in the rms sample are by selection ir - bright and thus relatively evolved compared with embedded typically younger class 0 sources .",
    "therefore , it may not be surprising that the fit from the class i low mass protostars has a better correlation with the high mass outflow sources than the fit from the class 0 ir - dark sample . moreover , as discussed in @xcite , each high mass outflow source , given the observed spatial resolution and distances , likely contains multiple protostars , where the luminosity of the cluster is dominated by the ir - bright rms source .",
    "thus , the high mass sample of outflow sources plotted in figure [ , see table [ table : co ] ) for these two sources are plotted in figure [ aperture centred on c - mm5 , with the @xmath4co(2 - 1 ) emission integrated over a similar velocity range as seen in c - mm3 and c - mm12 .",
    "it is stressed that this gives a very approximate limit for the outflow properties",
    ". the derived limit on the outflow force for afgl989-irs1 is lower than expected given its bolometric luminosity ( 1800 l@xmath6 , taken from the rms survey ) , which may be a result of the more evolved nature of this source .",
    "the estimated outflow forces for c - mm3 and c - mm12 are below what would be expected given their likely young , class 0-type nature . however ,",
    "as the class 0 low mass sample of @xcite was observed with a single dish telescope compared with the interferometric observations performed here , even though the spatial resolution is similar ( given the larger distance to ngc 2264-c , @xmath0738pc ) the interferometric observations will likely miss some flux .",
    "furthermore , the outflow forces estimated for c - mm3 and c - mm12 have not been corrected for optical depth effects and are thus likely underestimated by a factor of @xmath05 - 10 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite estimated a total outflow force for lobes f5 and f7 ( which at the higher resolution of our sma observations are found to be associated with c - mm12 ) of 4.6@xmath1110@xmath47m@xmath6kms@xmath5yr@xmath5 , compared with 1.1@xmath1110@xmath12m@xmath6 kms@xmath5yr@xmath5 estimated here .",
    "the true value of the outflow force for c - mm12 likely lies somewhere between these two values , accounting for the spatial filtering but also the ability to separate the outflows themselves at our higher resolution .",
    "there are still major difficulties when trying to link outflow properties between the low and high mass regimes ; the scales probed are different , and particularly in the high mass regime it is often not clear if a single or multiple sources are responsible for the emission .",
    "in addition , the different methods of estimating properties such as dynamical timescales between samples make it difficult to directly compare .",
    "@xcite suggest the perceived correlation may not be directly related to the actual driving mechanism , as the higher masses available in the high mass sample would provide higher values for outflow properties regardless of the underlying mechanism .",
    "this is also addressed by @xcite , who discuss that the core mass could be the main driver of the outflow scaling relation .",
    "taken at face value , the linear ( log - log ) fit between the low and high mass regimes does indeed suggest a correlation from low to high mass indicative of a similar formation mechanism between the regimes",
    ". however , there are significant caveats , as discussed above . our sma observations of ngc 2264-c emphasise the need for complementary high resolution observations with the ability to resolve a postulated single outflow and driving core into many components , to fully probe the outflow(s ) in intermediate / high mass star forming regions .",
    "we have observed the intermediate / high mass star forming region ngc 2264-c at an angular resolution of @xmath03@xmath1 with the sma at 1.3 mm and provide the first interferometric observations of the outflow tracers sio ( 5 - 4 ) and @xmath4co(2 - 1 ) .",
    "of the ten 1.3 mm continuum peaks identified , four of which are new detections , only two are clearly driving bipolar outflows .",
    "the sio ( 5 - 4 ) observations unambiguously reveal two high velocity bipolar outflows , driven by c - mm3 and c - mm12 .",
    "high velocity emission from so , @xmath4co , and h@xmath3co , along with lower velocity emission from ch@xmath2oh , also traces both outflows .",
    "comparing our sma data to our jcmt sio(8 - 7 ) observations , we find that sio(8 - 7 ) is detected only towards these two bipolar outflows with the jcmt . in the lower resolution",
    "jcmt observations , the outflow driving sources are ambiguous . thus , the combination of these observations emphasises the power of high - resolution , multi - line observations to remove ambiguity in identifying outflow driving sources .",
    "we find a clear evolutionary differentiation among the continuum sources present in this cluster .",
    "comparison of the molecular chemistry and of the mid and far ir , millimetre , sub - millimetre , and radio emission reveals that it is the likely youngest , mm brightest sources , c - mm3 and c - mm12 , that are driving the dominant bipolar outflows .",
    "both of these cores are ir - dark and molecular line weak and have no detected centimetre-@xmath66 radio emission , indicating that they are likely at a very early stage of evolution .",
    "in contrast , the ir - bright , most evolved source in the region , the rms source afgl 989-irs1 , does not drive a molecular outflow . however , the wind from this source @xcite is likely driving a low density cavity @xcite that may be responsible for the molecular line rich `` ridge '' feature we observe , including its class i ch@xmath67oh maser emission .    *",
