    "the enormous potential of stellar photometry from space is finally being realised by the most ( microvariability & oscillations of stars ) mission , a low - cost canadian space agency ( csa ) microsatellite which was launched in june 2003 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    this potential  particularly for stellar seismology  had been recognised for almost two decades ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , and many dedicated space missions have been proposed .",
    "missions which reached a fairly advanced state of development but were not ultimately funded include : prisma @xcite , ppm @xcite , stars @xcite , spex @xcite , and mons @xcite .",
    "the status of the funding for the esa mision eddington @xcite is still not entirely clear .",
    "the first instrument designed and built for stellar seismology through photometry from space was evris @xcite , a 10-cm telescope feeding a photomultiplier tube detector , mounted aboard the mars-96 probe .",
    "unfortunately , mars-96 failed to achieve orbit .",
    "evris was intended to be the precursor to corot @xcite , the cnes - funded mission due for launch in 2006 , to explore stellar structure through seismology and search for planets through photometric transits .",
    "expected to join corot in space in 2008 is kepler @xcite , whose primary goal is detection of earth - sized planets via transits , but it will also obtain photometry uniquely powerful for stellar astrophysics .    another useful tool for space photometry has turned out to be nasa s wire satellite , whose primary scientific mission of infrared mapping failed . however , the satellite has proved to be a stable functioning platform for its 5-cm startracker telescope and ccd , which has been exploited successfully for stellar photometric studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most , wire , corot , kepler and eddington are all ccd - based photometric experiments , and the first three are low - earth - orbit ( leo ) missions with similar orbital environments ( radiation and scattered earthshine ) .",
    "all these missions have a common need to extract information on stellar variability from data cubes consisting of upwards of hundreds of thousands of two - dimensional ccd frames ( or sub - rasters ) containing from hundreds to millions of pixels each .",
    "the modes of observation range from in - focus ( kepler ) and defocussed imaging ( corot , and most in its direct imaging mode ) of fields with many targets to fabry imaging of the instrument pupil illuminated by a single target ( most in its principal operation mode ) .",
    "in addition to its scientific value , most is a superb testbed for leo space photometric techniques which can be applied to other missions .",
    "we present here a comprehensive approach for handling and reducing techniques which are relevant for other leo space photometry missions and ground - based ccd photometry of cluster fields .",
    "because most is the first fully operational ccd space photometer , we use its archive to describe our reduction technique .",
    "this justifies a brief description of the mission .",
    "the most instrument is a 15-cm rumak - maksutov optical telescope feeding twin ccd detectors ( one dedicated to stellar photometry , the other for guiding ) through a single broadband filter .",
    "most was designed to obtain rapid photometry ( at least one exposure per minute ) of bright stars ( @xmath0 ) with long time coverage ( up to 2 months ) with high duty cycle .",
    "its goal is to achieve photometric precision down to a few micromagnitudes ( @xmath1mag ) in a fourier amplitude spectrum at frequencies down to about 1 mhz .",
    "it has achieved this goal for targets such as procyon @xcite and @xmath2 boo @xcite .",
    "most is a microsatellite with a mass of only 54 kg and hence little inertia .",
    "it is able to perform optical photometry of point sources thanks to a stabilisation system or attitude control system ( acs ) developed by dynacon , inc .",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "previous microsats could not achieve pointing stability better than about @xmath3 to @xmath4 , essentially useless for optical astronomical imaging .",
    "the requirement for the most acs performace was @xmath5 ; the goal was @xmath6 .",
    "the actual acs performance was improved during the commissioning and early science operations of most through software upgrades and refined use of the acs reaction wheels , so that pointing precision is now about @xmath7 rms .",
    "anticipating image wander across the most science ccd as large as @xmath5 , and the lack of an on - board flatfielding calibration system ( due to power and cost limitations ) , the most design relies on producing a pupil image illuminated by target starlight .",
    "this extended image is produced by a fabry microlens ( similar in concept to the fabry lens common to photoelectric photometers ) and moves by no more than 0.1 pixel if the star beam moves by @xmath8 from optimum pointing .",
    "( the resolution of the ccd is @xmath9 per physical pixel . ) to provide simultaneous sky background measurements , and for redundancy against fabry lens and/or ccd defects , most is equipped with a @xmath10 array of microlenses , each of which images the telescope entrance pupil . centred on each microlens is a field stop , 1 arcmin in diameter , etched in a chromium mask .",
    "we refer to @xcite , for a detailed description of the focal plane arrangement and in particular to figs.7 and 8 of that paper .",
    "the primary science target is typically centred on one of these microlenses .",
    "a @xmath11 binned mean profile of the resulting fabry images is shown in fig.[f : meanfabryimage ] .",
    "each fabry image is an annulus with an outer diameter of 44 ( unbinned ) pixels .",
    "the pixels outside the annulus are sampled in a square subraster which gives an indicator for light scattered away from the pupil image or entering the focal plane independently of the telescope optics .",
    "the principal data format for most photometry  referred to as science data stream 2 ( sds2 )  consists of a resolved image of the target fabry image , binned @xmath11 ( to satisfy the limited most downlink rates ) , and 7 more heavily binned adjacent sky background fabry images .",
    "there are also subrasters of the ccd shielded from light which provide dark and bias measurements .",
    "each sds2 data file also contains a complete set of exposure parameters ( exposure start time , integration time , ccd gain , etc . ) and extensive satellite telemetry ( e.g. , ccd temperature , acs errors , etc . ) .    for longer - term data backup or to increase the sampling rate without exceeding the downlink limits , the most subraster images can be processed on - board , to produce science data stream 1 ( sds1 ) .",
    "fabry image windows are integrated to give total intensities , backgrounds are generated from the four corners of each window , and sums of the pixel intensities binned in columns and rows are generated .",
    "sds1 data can be sent to earth at a rate 10 times higher than sds2 , but do not allow as flexible reduction and analysis .",
    "most also obtains direct imaging photometry of @xmath12 stars , as in a cluster field like m67 .",
    "] , based on defocussed images ( fwhm @xmath13 2.2 pixels ) in portions of the science ccd not covered by the fabry microlens field stop mask .",
    "processing of these data is described by @xcite .",
    "the acs ccd is now also used to obtain photometry of about @xmath14 guide stars , to be described by @xcite .    in this paper , we are primarily concerned with most photometry in the sds2 format , although we do address sds1 in section [ sec : sds1 ] .",
    "the most fabry imaging approach is quite insensitive to telescope pointing errors , by keeping an extended nearly fixed pupil image on the same ccd pixels ( to within 0.1 physical pixel if pointing deviations are less than @xmath8 ) .",
    "however , movements of the incoming beam of starlight on the fabry microlens will introduce small photometric errors due to slightly different throughputs with changes in the light path through the telescope and camera optics .",
    "the greatest sensitivity may be due to tiny inhomogeneities in the fabry microlens itself .",
    "the microlens array was etched into the bk-7 glass window above the ccd , and each element was tested in the lab for optical quality with artificial star images .",
    "defects in certain microlenses in the array were identified and mapped in advance of launch , but there is always the possibility of subtle damage in orbit .",
    "one would expect some correlation between photometric errors and attitude control system ( acs ) errors , but the relationship is complicated by the fact that the acs system updates its guiding information typically once per second , whereas science exposures last for tens of seconds for the majority of targets .",
    "thus , the star beam has moved across some complex path during the exposure . in an observing run , occasionally there is a pointing error which places the star too close to the edge of the field stop during part or all of an exposure , and significant signal from the stellar point spread function ( psf ) is lost .    pointing errors",
    "can also bring other sources ( stars , galaxies and nebulae ) near the primary science target in and out of the field stop , introducing photometric errors .",
    "this was explored extensively in most mission planning , and there are no sources close to the most fabry imaging targets bright enough to affect the intended photometric precision .    in any event ,",
    "most pointing has improved to the level where these factors are now relatively unimportant , but some of them did manifest themselves in the commissioning science data ( e.g. , @xmath15 cet ; see @xcite ) and in some of the early primary science data .",
    "the reduction procedure takes acs output into account to automatically reject images where at least one error value exceeds a pre - defined limit ( see [ ssec : rejection ] ) , indicating a target position being outside the nominal fabry lens area at least during part of the integration .",
    "cet , october 2004 ) . for transitions through the south atlantic anomaly , where the terrestrial magnetic field is weak , the impact rates rise significantly . ]",
    "cosmic ray subtraction is important in ground - based ccd imaging , and it is generally even more critical for space - based photometry .",
    "the effects of energetic particle hits on the most science ccd have been mitigated in the mission design in several ways :    1 .",
    "the ccds are shielded by the camera housing , equivalent to a spherical barrier of aluminium 5 mm thick .",
    "most is in a low earth orbit ( altitude 820 km ) in which radiation fluxes are relatively low .",
    "most fabry imaging photometry employs only a small effective area of the science ccd , rather than the entire @xmath16 chip , presenting a relatively small target for incoming particles .",
    "most s orbit does carry it through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa , fig.[f : saa ] ) , a dip in the earth s magnetosphere which allows higher cosmic ray fluxes at lower altitudes .",
    "passages through the saa mean increased risk of an on - board computer crash due to a single event upset ( seu ) or `` latch - up '' .",
    "most has experienced such particle - hit - induced crashes at an average rate of about once every two months in the 18 months of normal science operations .",
    "otherwise , the increased particle fluxes during saa passages do not have a significant effect on either acs accuracy or stellar photometry .",
    "for those particles which do reach the relevant portions of the most science ccd , there are two factors which make them easier to treat in the photometric reduction :    1 .",
    "cosmic ray hits are statistically independent in time ( poisson statistics , see [ sssec : coscand ] ) .",
    "the most likely situation is that a particle will strike only a single pixel , making most hits easy to distinguish from other artefacts ( see [ sssec : cosaffect ] ) .",
    "equ data ) .",
    "the inner circle centred on the north pole is void of information , since the maximum geographic latitude to be reached by most is @xmath17 @xcite , not @xmath18 .",
    "spacecraft passages over greenland are clearly associated with higher stray - light intensity , which introduces @xmath19d@xmath20 aliases to the fourier spectra . ]",
    "any off - axis bright source such as the earth will produce bright diffraction rims around the primary and secondary mirror even for perfectly baffled optics .",
    "these rims are clearly visible in figs .",
    "[ f : rmsfabryimage ] and [ f : rms_fourier_noise ] .",
    "since stray - light effects are imposed on us by nature and not peculiar to most , any follow - up space project will have to deal with stray - light contamination , and it is essential to find reliable correction techniques .      the most orbit plane inclination of 98.72  results in a dusk  dawn polar orbit because of the orbit plane precession due to the non - spherical terrestrial mass distribution .",
    "this precession compensates for the annual movement of our sun along the celestial equator .",
    "the @xmath21 deviation of the orbit plane from orthogonality to the terrestrial equator together with the obliquity of the ecliptic of aproximately 23.5  results in passages of most over the illuminated north polar region during summer , which causes increased stray light .",
    "in extreme cases , the excessive stray light at certain most orbit phases can reduce the duty cycle from nearly @xmath22 to @xmath23 .      for space imaging or photometry missions which need to point to fields at low solar elongations , scattered light from the sun ",
    "directly into the telescope or via the zodiacal light background  would be the biggest challenge .",
    "the most mission was deliberately designed so that target fields are always in the opposite part of the sky from the sun .",
    "the lowest solar elongation possible for most observations is about @xmath24 .",
    "direct solar light rejection is not a concern for most photometry .      for any leo astronomical photometry satellite , scattered light from the illuminated portion of the earth",
    "is a major source of sky background , and stray - light rejection is a major consideration in mission design and planning .",
    "due to restrictions on the payload envelope in the most design , the instrument could not have a large external baffle .",
    "three approaches were adopted to reduce the influence of scattered earthshine on most photometry :    1 .",
    "the sun - synchronous dawn - dusk orbit , combined with the choice of target fields in a continuous viewing zone ( cvz ) pointing away from the sun , means that the most telescope tends to look out over the shadowed limb of the earth .",
    "the telescope and camera are equipped with internal baffles and anti - reflective coatings .",
    "the spacecraft bus was intended to be a light - tight housing allowing light to enter only through the instrument aperture .",
    "none of these approaches is perfect .    1 .",
    "as was mentioned in sec.[sss : orbit ] , the most orbit is sun - synchronous . since the obliquity of the ecliptic is about 23.5@xmath25 , most orbits over the earth s terminator only at times close to the equinoxes . during the solstices ,",
    "a significant fraction of the bright earth limb is visible to the most telescope .",
    "2 .   the internal baffles and coatings appear to be working properly . but",
    "some light is scattered into the optics by parts of the the external door mechanism ( which protected the most optics during launch and release into orbit and acts as a safeguard if there is a danger of the telescope pointing directly at the sun ) , whose coatings may have been damaged on launch .",
    "one of the most spacecraft s external panels was `` shimmed '' when mounted to the bus ( i.e. , a thin piece of metal was inserted to compensate for a misalignment of mounting holes ) .",
    "this gap in the spacecraft structure allows light to enter the instrument from an unanticipated direction .    as a result ,",
    "the major component of sky background in most photometry is earthshine , modulated with the satellite orbital period of 101.4 min ( frequency = 14.2d@xmath20 = 165 @xmath1hz ) and , to a lesser extent , with a period of approximately 1 day as most s orbit returns it to a similar position over the earth ( and hence , a similar reflection feature in the terrestrial albedo ) on a daily cycle .",
    "an example of the presence of stray light in raw most photometry is shown in fig.[fig : decorsteps ] .",
    "the amplitude and shape of the stray - light modulation is highly dependent on the season of observations , the `` roll '' of the spacecraft ( i.e. , the position angle of the telescope about its optical axis ) , and the location of the target field within the cvz .",
    "the relative contribution of maximum stray light also depends on the brightness of the target star .",
    "for procyon @xcite , even though the observations are obtained near winter solstice and hence near the worst geometry for light scattered from the bright earth limb , the stray light never exceeds @xmath26 of the stellar signal ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "for the star @xmath28 equ ( @xmath29 ) , observed near the summer solstice , the stray light reaches a maximum of about @xmath30 the stellar signal ( see fig.[fig : decorsteps ] ) .",
    "fig.[f : stray light ] represents the variations of stray light as a function of most position over the earth for many orbits during the @xmath28 equ run .",
    "the stray light reaches maxima over the north pole and arctic regions  a combination of the high albedo of those areas which are continuously exposed to sunlight near summer solstice .",
    "( the antarctic is in shadow , and does not dominate the stray light until times closer to the winter solstice . )    in extreme cases , excessive stray light in most photometry can reduce its duty cycle from nearly @xmath22 to about @xmath23 per orbit .",
    "such periodic gaps introduce aliases at a spacing of 14.2d@xmath20 or 165 @xmath1hz . for comparison",
    ", the wire startracker ( buzasi et al . 2000 ) typically achieves an orbital duty cycle of about @xmath31 , despite being in a similar orbit to most .",
    "this is because the wire platform must switch directions each half - orbit , to keep its batteries at the proper operating temperature , and the startracker focal plane receives even more severe scattered earthshine .",
    "( keep in mind that this instrument was designed as an acs startracker , not a photometric instrument . )",
    "measurements on march 6 , at a target position only @xmath32 from the full moon caused massive contamination by direct stray light . ]    because most targets are concentrated in a cvz which is roughly equatorial ( @xmath33 ) , the moon can occasionally come very close to a most target field during observation . and because most observations are made in the anti - sun direction , the phase of the moon is close to full when this happens .",
    "two examples of a close passage of the moon during most photometry occurred for the commissioning science target , @xmath34 cet , and the early primary science target , @xmath35 vir . in march 2004 ,",
    "the centre of the moon came within @xmath36 of @xmath35 vir during most monitoring of that star .",
    "the effects on the mean background are shown in fig.[f : betvirmoon ] .",
    "the most stray - light rejection system was never designed to cope with such a close passage of such a bright source .",
    "fortunately , lunar encounters like this are relatively rare and short - lived .    during observations of @xmath34 ceti in october 2004 ,",
    "the moon came to within 20@xmath25 of the star , and as it approached , it underwent a total lunar eclipse .",
    "this was an excellent opportunity to gauge the contribution of moonshine to most stray light at lunar elongations which would be somewhat more common in most observations .",
    "the mean background intensities for this encounter are shown in fig.[f : lunareclipse ] .",
    "this and other tests of most photometry with respect to lunar phase and elongation indicate that the moon does not have a noticeable influence on most background measurements until it approaches within about 28@xmath25 of the most target field . generally , the moon will affect the background at the level of a few percent .",
    "although a typical most observing run is about a month long ( covering only about one lunar synodic period ) , there is no evidence to date that the moon introduces a periodic component to the most photometric background .",
    "cet . at an angular separation of 28 degrees , during an orbit phase of rather low earthshine , lunar stray light begins to show up in the data . on oct .",
    "27 , 2004 , a lunar eclipse occurred during two orbits , producing a decay of stray - light intensity by @xmath37 at an angular separation of 20 degrees .",
    "the background intensity keeps increasing for two orbits after the eclipse , until the angle between moon and target attains a minimum . ]",
    "the most ccds are passively cooled to a temperature around @xmath38 and maintained at a given operating temperature by a trim heater with an accuracy of @xmath39 . without regulation ,",
    "the temperature would be modulated with the orbital period with a peak - to - peak amplitude of about @xmath40 . at temperatures below about @xmath41",
    ", the dark noise remains below @xmath42 electrons / pixel / sec and does not affect the fabry imaging photometry .",
    "the ccd focal plane temperature is monitored continuously to an accuracy of @xmath43 .",
    "all most photometry is checked for any correlation with ccd temperature and other operational parameters .",
    "no system is optically perfect , and that is true for the fabry microlenses as well . if the star beam passes through a small flaw in the microlens , a distorted image of the entrance pupil will result .",
    "the deviation of an individual target image from the mean doughnut shape is used as a rejection criterion ( see [ ssec : shape ] ) .",
    "this also is an indicator of when the pointing has moved too close to the edge of the fabry field stop and some of the starlight is obstructed .",
    "pixel intensities are considered to form a 3dimensional array @xmath44 , a data cube , where the index @xmath45 shall consistently refer to the time axis , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 represent the horizontal and vertical coordinates on the @xmath45th exposure . the number of exposures , i.e. the maximum value for the time index , is denoted @xmath48 , the upper limits for spatial indices are @xmath49 ( width ) and @xmath50 ( height ) . in our case @xmath51 .    in this context , indexing refers to virtual pixels , each virtual pixel intensity representing a @xmath11 bin of physical pixel intensities .",
    "statistical moments are denoted by an operator @xmath52 , where only indices inside the bracket are used for summation , and the order of the moment is given as an exponent .",
    "e.g. , the temporal variance of intensity for the pixel @xmath53 is denoted @xmath54 .",

    "correspondingly , @xmath58 denotes the intensity summed over all background pixels .",
    "the idea of identifying and correcting outliers in all our applications is based on data smoothing by a distance - weighted average ( dwa ) , similar to the whittaker filter @xcite or hodrick - prescott filter @xcite .",

    "the residual correlation between the integrated light curve and spacecraft position ( [ sssec : satpos ] ) is performed using a dwa in terms of sub - satellite geographic latitude .",
    "the spatial filter ( in terms of image coordinates ) was used in context with the local dispersion model ( [ ssec : ldm ] ) , which did not prevail in the final reduction procedure and is mentioned here for completeness .",
    "the first step of the data reduction procedure is the assignment of each pixel to either target or background , hence defining an aperture to be used for photometry .",

    "each point source would produce a characteristic response function on the ccd image , and the combined stray - light contamination may be described as the integral of all these response functions .",

    "the portion of the stray light in the intensity - intensity diagram which can not be removed entirely in one decorrelation step  i.e. systematic deviations from the trend line , for example a loop  is likely to re - appear as a linear trend when a different background pixel is used in a subsequent step .",
    "this property provides the chance to correct for most of the stray light without explicitly introducing the orbital period or phase .",
    "the present method turns out to be considerably less invasive towards the characteristics of spectral noise than a frequently used method based on the residual intensity determined from a phase plot with the orbital period .",
    "finally , to take long - term stray - light changes into account , the complete dataset is divided into a sequence of subsets ( e.g. , three days long in the case of @xmath28 equ , figs.[fig : corr ] and [ fig : corrloop ] ) , and the stray - light correction is performed for these subsets individually .          in the optimum case ,",
    "all of the stray light will be removed , but each decorrelation step necessarily reduces the signal in the target pixels .",
    "signals of 200ppm amplitude at 4 different frequencies were additively synthesized in each of the target pixels .",
    "the decay of these amplitudes for the sum of all target pixels as a function of number of decorrelation steps is given in fig.[fig : lossosignal ] .",
    "obviously , the first decorrelation steps dramatically reduce the stray - light amplitude and after about 100 decorrelations there is a constant , but less significant decrease of the stray - light amplitude for each new decorrelation .    but",
    "also the `` intrinsic '' signal is reduced in amplitude , independent of frequency .",
    "the amplitude decrease per decorrelation step is approximately constant for all decorrelation steps and corresponds to that for the stray light after many steps .",
    "this property allows one to reconstruct the initial amplitude even after a large number of decorrelations .",
    "this decrease in amplitude is due to the fact that  in the case of pure noise ",
    "the slope of a linear regression in the intensity - intensity diagram will scatter about zero , and that a trend correction will work for both positive and negative deviations . as a consequence",
    ", the decorrelation process with a non - zero slope always tends to reduce  but never to increase  the target pixel intensities .",
    "the expected value of the fraction of noise that is removed will be proportional to the rms deviation of the underlying probability distribution of regression slopes , where the terminology `` noise '' applies to signal at periods different from the orbital as well , if intensity is plotted vs. intensity .",
    "simultaneously , the point - to - point scatter dramatically decreases with the first decorrelation steps , but shows asymptotically a shallower decay than the amplitudes .",
    "hence , an optimum signal - to - noise ratio is obtained by terminating the decorrelation loop long before all iterations have been performed , and to use the later steps only to determine the slope of a linear trend for reconstructing the amplitude ( solid line in fig.[fig : lossosignal ] ) .",
    "the extent of the fabry image is determined by the entrance pupil of the instrument , i.e. well - defined compared to direct - field images .",
    "however , we can not be absolutely sure to have pure background pixels in what we consider as background .",
    "the question addresses a problem of aperture photometry in general , and possibly the decay of signal amplitudes with increasing number of iterations is  to some extent  due to target intensity leaking into our reference pixels ( due to , e.g. , scattered light in impurities of the microlens ) .",
    "the decorrelation technique is by far more sensitive to this leakage than `` classical '' subtraction of background intensity .",
    "a background pixel containing target information would cause the entire target signal to be removed in a single step of the decorrelation cascade .",
    "we would immediately see this effect , e.g. in fig.[fig : lossosignal ] .",
    "the fact that the procedure works is the best indicator that the influence by the target on the background pixels is negligible .",

    "this motion would cause two different pixels on the detector to be affected at different times , and the resulting time lag is expected to be larger for distant pixels .",
    "the formal consequence is to introduce a time lag between the correlation of two pixel intensities as a new free parameter and to perform an optimisation in the time direction through minimising the rms deviation of pixel intensities from the trend line in the intensity - intensity diagram ( fig.[fig : corr ] ) .",

    "2 .   a structure of fwhm @xmath87 in terms of orbit phase sampled at both pixels synchronously ( i.e. without a time lag ) produces the sharp peak below the loop .",
    "this example illustrates the plausibility of moving stray - light patterns to be responsible for the loop - shaped intensity - intensity diagrams",
    ".    however , when the idea was applied to most measurements , the increased number of free parameters did not lead to reasonable results .",
    "although the postulate of static stray - light sources ( permitting synchronous variations of pixel intensities only ) is not claimed to be more reliable than the existence of moving stray - light artefacts  since animated `` movies '' ( using mdm , see section [ sec : visual ] ) of the raw fabry images clearly show moving structures ",
    "the quantitative description of this motion by a constant time lag between pixel intensities leads to a less efficient stray - light correction than the technique introduced in [ sssec : decorrelation ] for mainly two reasons :    1 .",

    "another stray - light correction scheme took advantage of an obvious direct correlation between the mean background and the target intensity , which suggested that one should compute the mean background as the normalised bivariate moment of order zero .",
    "a correction of the mean background by calculating a regression of the target intensity relative to a mean background and correcting for a slope led to clearly better results than the ldm described in [ ssec : ldm ] .",
    "this encouraged us to investigate higher order correlations using @xmath109 where indices @xmath46 , @xmath47 refer to background pixels only .",
    "the result is a bivariate polynomial fit @xmath110 of order @xmath78 to the background pixel intensities , which is obtained by setting @xmath111    applying various moment orders led to quite impressive results , but the stray - light peaks still dominated the light curve ( fig.[f : moments ] ) .",
    "the `` lens profile '' is intended to indicate optical distortions and disturbances by flawed areas on the fabry lens .",

    "will result in a reduced signal every time light passes through such blemishes . in a first step we simulated a constant light source , which was performed for @xmath108cet by prewhitening the light curve with 20 frequencies .",
    "then we correlated the residual intensity to the acs error values stored in the image headers , indicating the deviation of the line - of - sight from the ideal position referring to the centre of the frame .",
    "usually there exists more than one acs error value for an image , because the acs system acquires a reading every second , while the typical integration time for a single frame is @xmath112 seconds and longer . in the case of @xmath108cet ( @xmath112 seconds integration time ) , up to @xmath112 acs error values describe the movement of the target across the aperture during a given exposure .",
    "it is therefore impossible to immediately assign an erroneous data point to a specific acs value . to overcome this problem , we used a grid of acs error values and classified the boxes as `` good '' or `` bad '' according to a chosen threshold for the residual to the `` constant '' light curve .",
    "`` good '' boxes are those where at least one data point has been obtained with a value below the chosen threshold and which contains an acs value corresponding to the given box .",

    "the pointing precision has significantly improved since the beginning of most observations .",
    "now it is practically impossible to produce a reliable lens profile using this technique .",
    "however , in case the acs gets worse and lenses get damaged we might have to return to this tool for properly identifying bad data points .",

    "for @xmath96 most targets ( table [ tabquality ] ) observed from october , 2003 , to march , 2005 , the typical fraction of exposures transmitted in the sds2 format was 41% . about 52% of the pixels in a fabry frame",

    "the reduction method described in this paper was applied to most fabry image photometry and relies on the following steps :    * construction of a `` data cube '' of all ccd frames including all fits header information to which all software components consistently refer * definition of target and background pixels * rejection of images deviating significantly from the average * cosmic ray correction ( correction of individual pixels or elimination of an entire image , if the number of pixels to be corrected is above a chosen threshold ) * stray - light correction - the core of our reduction tool .",
    "this correction is based on the assumption that the stray - light sources superpose for a given pixel as individual point sources .",

    "the improvement in data quality achievable with our method is displayed in table [ tabquality ] ( p. ) containing a comparison of both stray - light amplitude and frequency - domain noise for raw vs. reduced data .",
    "a comparison with other reduction techniques clearly indicates that no artefacts are introduced in the photometry .",
    "this is a considerable advantage when interpreting complex frequency spectra with amplitudes close to the noise level .",
    "simple binning of consecutive orbits and a corresponding trendline correction will perform at least as well as the decorrelation technique in the sense of noise .",

    "time - domain binning leads to the introduction of a periodic frequency - domain filter function .",
    "in other words , the spectral noise level is not uniformly distributed in frequency , which has serious implications on the detailed analysis of individual frequencies .",
    "the noise level can be pushed down considerably while paying the price of distortion , which we consider less convenient than the slightly higher , but undistorted noise .",
    "although there are frequency regimes and timescales of intrinsic stellar variation where the better photon statistics of binned data may be more desirable for the task at hand than e.g. eliminating pixels from the fabry image and increasing the overall poisson noise , we are generally convinced that a low noise level is not the only thing to strive for .",

    "<S> the most ( microvariability & oscillations of stars ) satellite obtains ultraprecise photometry from space with high sampling rates and duty cycles . astronomical photometry or imaging missions in low earth orbits , like most , are especially sensitive to scattered light from earthshine , and all these missions have a common need to extract target information from voluminous data cubes . </S>",
    "<S> they consist of upwards of hundreds of thousands of two - dimensional ccd frames ( or sub - rasters ) containing from hundreds to millions of pixels each , where the target information , superposed on background and instrumental effects , is contained only in a subset of pixels ( fabry images , defocussed images , mini - spectra ) . </S>",
    "<S> we describe a novel reduction technique for such data cubes : resolving linear correlations of target and background pixel intensities . </S>",
    "<S> this stepwise multiple linear regression removes only those target variations which are also detected in the background . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of regression analysis versus background subtraction is the appropriate scaling , taking into account that the amount of contamination may differ from pixel to pixel . </S>",
    "<S> the multivariate solution for all pairs of target / background pixels is minimally invasive of the raw photometry while being very effective in reducing contamination due to , e.g. , stray light . </S>",
    "<S> the technique is tested and demonstrated with both simulated oscillation signals and real most photometry .    </S>",
    "<S> methods : data analysis  space vehicles : instruments  techniques : photometric . </S>"
