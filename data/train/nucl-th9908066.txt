    "from 1973 to 1987 , there was a consensus that the @xmath0 coupling constant is @xmath7 ( equivalent to @xmath8  @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite from the analysis of @xmath9 data in 1973 , and confirmed by koch and pietarinen  @xcite in 1980 . around that same time , the neutral - pion coupling constant was determined by kroll  @xcite from the analysis of @xmath10 data by means of forward dispersion relations ; he obtained @xmath11 ( equivalent to @xmath12 ) .",
    "the picture changed in 1987 , when the nijmegen group  @xcite determined the neutral - pion coupling constant in a partial - wave analysis of @xmath10 data and obtained @xmath13 .",
    "including also the magnetic moment interaction between protons in the analysis , the value shifted to @xmath14 in 1990  @xcite .",
    "triggered by these events , arndt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reanalysed the @xmath9 data to determine the charged - pion coupling constant and obtained @xmath15 .",
    "in subsequent work , the nijmegen group also analysed @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 data .",
    "the status of their work as of 1993 is summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite where they claim that the most accurate values are obtained in their combined @xmath10 and @xmath16 analysis yielding @xmath19 ( equivalent to @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 ( equivalent to @xmath22 ) .",

    "the vpi @xmath25 analysis extracted @xmath26 and @xmath27 as well as the charge - independent value @xmath28 @xcite .    also bugg and",
    "coworkers have performed new determinations of the @xmath0 coupling constant . based upon precise @xmath9 data in the 100310 mev range and applying fixed-@xmath23 dispersion relations",
    ", they obtained the value @xmath29 ( equivalent to @xmath30 )  @xcite . from the analysis of @xmath25 elastic data between 210 and 800 mev , bugg and machleidt  @xcite",
    "have deduced @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , it may appear that recent determinations show a consistent trend towards a lower value for @xmath33 with no indication for substantial charge dependence .",
    "unfortunately this is not true .",
    "there is one recent determination that does not follow the current trend . using the chew extrapolation procedure ,",
    "the uppsala neutron research group has deduced the charged - pion coupling constant from high precision @xmath16 charge - exchange data at 162 mev  @xcite .",
    "their latest result is @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "we note that the method used by the uppsala group is controversial  @xcite .",
    "if one tries to summarize the confusing current picture then one may state that recent determinations of the neutral - pion coupling constant are , indeed , consistently on the low side with a value of @xmath35 covering about the range of current determinations .",
    "however , there is no such consistent picture for the charged - pion coupling constant with recent determinations being up to nine standard deviations apart . if we trust the uppsala result of @xmath34 , then large charge - splitting of @xmath33 exists .",
    "this is the motive for the present paper in which we will investigate the impact of charge - splitting of @xmath33 on our established theoretical understanding of the charge dependence of the nuclear force . in particular",
    ", we will look into the charge - independence breaking ( cib ) of the @xmath2 scattering length , @xmath3 .",
    "we find that @xmath3 depends sensitively on the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath1 is only moderately larger than @xmath4 , the established theoretical explanation of @xmath3 ( in terms of pion mass splitting ) is completely wiped out .",
    "the equality between proton - proton ( @xmath10 ) [ or neutron - neutron ( @xmath36 ) ] and neutron - proton ( @xmath16 ) nuclear interactions is known as charge independence  a symmetry that is slightly broken .",
    "this is seen most clearly in the @xmath2 nucleon - nucleon scattering lengths .",
    "the latest empirical values for the singlet scattering length @xmath37 and effective range @xmath38 are  @xcite : @xmath39 the values given for @xmath10 and @xmath36 scattering refer to the nuclear part of the interaction as indicated by the superscript @xmath40 .",
    "electromagnetic effects have been removed from the experimental values , which is model dependent .",
    "the uncertainties quoted for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are due to this model dependence .",
    "it is useful to define the following averages : @xmath43 by definition , charge - independence breaking ( cib ) is the difference between the average of @xmath10 and @xmath36 , on the one hand , and @xmath16 on the other : @xmath44 thus , the @xmath25 singlet scattering length shows a clear signature of cib in strong interactions .",
    "the current understanding is that the charge dependence of nuclear forces is due to differences in the up and down quark masses and electromagnetic interactions . on a more phenomenological level ,",
    "major causes of cib are the mass splittings of isovector mesons ( particularly , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) and irreducible pion - photon exchanges .    it has been known for a long time that the difference between the charged and neutral pion masses in the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) potential accounts for about 50% of @xmath3 . based upon the bonn meson - exchange model for the @xmath25 interaction  @xcite , also multiple pion exchanges have been taken into account . including these interactions , about 80% of the empirical @xmath3",
    "can be explained  @xcite .",
    "ericson and miller  @xcite obtained a very similar result using the meson - exchange model of partovi and lomon  @xcite .",
    "the cib effect from ope can be understood as follows . in nonrelativistic approximation  @xcite and disregarding isospin factors , ope is given by @xmath47 with @xmath48 the average nucleon mass , @xmath49 the pion mass , and * k * the momentum transfer .",
    "the above expression includes a form factor with cutoff mass @xmath50 and exponent @xmath51 .    for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the total spin and isospin of the two - nucleon system , respectively , we have @xmath56 where the superscripts 01 refer to @xmath57 . in the @xmath2 state",
    ", this potential expression is repulsive .",
    "the charge - dependent ope is then , @xmath58 for @xmath10 scattering , and @xmath59 for @xmath16 scattering .",
    "if we assume charge - independence of @xmath33 ( i.  e. , @xmath60 ) , then all cib comes from the charge splitting of the pion mass , which is  @xcite @xmath61    .predictions for @xmath3 as defined in eq .",
    "( 4 ) in units of fm without and with the assumption of charge - dependence of @xmath33 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     since the pion mass appears in the denominator of ope , the smaller @xmath62-mass exchanged in @xmath10 scattering generates a larger ( repulsive ) potential in the @xmath2 state as compared to @xmath16 where also the larger @xmath63-mass is involved .",
    "moreover , the @xmath62-exchange in @xmath16 scattering carries a negative sign , which further weakens the @xmath16 ope potential .",
    "the bottom line is that the @xmath10 potential is more repulsive than the @xmath16 potential .",
    "the quantitative effect on @xmath3 is about 3 fm ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) .",
    "we now turn to the cib created by the @xmath64 exchange ( tpe ) contribution to the @xmath25 interaction .",
    "there are many diagrams that contribute ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a complete overview ) . for our qualitative discussion here , we pick the largest of all @xmath64 diagrams , namely , the box diagrams with @xmath65 intermediate states , fig",
    ".  1 . disregarding isospin factors and using some drastic approximations  @xcite ,",
    "the amplitude for such a diagram is @xmath66 ^ 2 } { ( m_{\\pi}^2+{\\bf k}^{2})^2(e_p+e^\\delta_p-2e_q ) } \\left ( \\frac{\\lambda^{2}-m_{\\pi}^{2}}{\\lambda^{2}+{\\bf k}^{2 } } \\right)^{2n } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath67 with * q * the relative momentum in the initial and final state ( for simplicity , we are considering a diagonal matrix element ) ; @xmath68 and @xmath69 with @xmath70 mev the @xmath71-isobar mass ; * s * is the spin transition operator between nucleon and @xmath71 . for the @xmath72 coupling constant , @xmath73 , the quark - model relationship @xmath74 is used  @xcite .",
    "for small momentum transfers * k * , this attractive contribution is roughly proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "thus for tpe , the heavier pions will provide less attraction than the lighter ones . charged and neutral pion exchanges occur for @xmath10 as well as for @xmath16 , and it is important to take the isospin factors carried by the various diagrams into account .",
    "they are given in fig .  1 below each diagram .",
    "for @xmath10 scattering , the diagram with double @xmath63 exchange carries the largest factor , while double @xmath63 exchange carries only a small relative weight in @xmath16 scattering .",
    "consequently , @xmath10 scattering is less attractive than @xmath16 scattering which leads to an increase of @xmath3 by 0.79 fm due to the diagrams of fig .",
    "1 . the crossed diagrams of this type reduce this result and including all @xmath64 exchange diagrams one finds a total effect of 0.36 fm  @xcite .",
    "diagrams that go beyond @xmath64 have also been investigated and contribute another 1 fm ( see table 1 for a summary ) .    in this way",
    ", pion - mass splitting explains about 80% of @xmath3 .",
    "in this section , we will consider also charge - splitting of @xmath33 , besides pion mass splitting .    as discussed in the introduction",
    ", some current determinations of @xmath33 may suggest the values @xmath76 accidentally , this splitting is  in relative terms  about the same as the pion - mass splitting ; that is @xmath77 from the discussion in the previous section , we know that ( for zero momentum transfer ) @xmath78 and @xmath79 which is not unexpected , anyhow . on the level of this qualitative discussion",
    ", we can then predict that any pionic charge - splitting satisfying eq .",
    "( 15 ) will create no cib from pion exchanges .",
    "consequently , a charge - splitting of @xmath33 as given in eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) will wipe out our established explanation of cib of the @xmath25 interaction .",
    "we have also conducted accurate numerical calculations based upon the bonn meson - exchange model for the @xmath25 interaction  @xcite .",
    "the details of these calculations are spelled out in ref .",
    "@xcite where , however , no charge - splitting of @xmath33 was considered . assuming the @xmath33 of eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 14 ) , we obtain the @xmath3 predictions given in the last column of table  1 .",
    "it is seen that the results of an accurate calculation go even beyond what the qualitative estimate suggested : the conventional cib prediction is not only reduced , it is reversed .",
    "this is easily understood if one recalls that the pion mass appears in the propagator @xmath80 .",
    "assuming an average @xmath81 , the 7% charge splitting of @xmath82 will lead to only about a 3% charge - dependent effect from the propagator .",
    "thus , if a 6% charge - splitting of @xmath83 is used , this will not only override the pion - mass effect , it will reverse it .    based upon this argument and on our numerical results",
    ", one can then estimate that a charge - splitting of @xmath83 of only about 3% ( e.  g. , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) would erase all cib prediction of the singlet scattering length that is based upon the conventional mechanism of pion mass splitting .",
    "all current determinations of the neutral - pion coupling constant seem to agree on a ` low ' value , like @xmath86 .",
    "however , for the charged - pion coupling constant , there is no such agreement . while some recent determinations of @xmath87 come up with a value close to @xmath88 , the uppsala group  @xcite obtains @xmath34 which implies a large charge - dependence of @xmath33 .    in this paper , we have investigated the consequences of such a large charge - dependence of @xmath33 for the conventional explanation of the charge - dependence of the @xmath2 scattering length , @xmath89 .",
    "we find that a charge - splitting of the coupling constant , defined by @xmath90 , of @xmath91 would wipe out the effect of the conventional mechanism ( namely , pion mass splitting ) and a splitting of @xmath92 would even reverse the charge - dependence of @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "besides pion mass splitting , we do not know of any other essential mechanism to explain the charge - dependence of @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that this mechnism is annihilated by a charge - splitting of @xmath33 .",
    "this may be taken as an indication that there is no significant charge splitting of the @xmath0 coupling constant .",
    "consequently , charge - dependence of @xmath33 is most likely not the resolution of the large differences in recent @xmath33 determinations ; which implies that we are dealing here with true discrepancies .",
    "the reasons for these discrepancies may be large ( unknown ) sytematic errors and/or a gross underestimation of the errors in essentially all present @xmath33 determinations .",
    "99 using @xmath0 lagrangians as defined in the authoritative review @xcite , the relevant relationships between the pseudoscalar pion coupling constant , @xmath33 , and the pseudovector one , @xmath93 , are @xmath94 and @xmath95 with @xmath96 mev the proton mass , @xmath97 mev the neutron mass , and @xmath98 mev the mass of the charged pion .",
