    "the recent observation of ultracold co in the inner disk of m31 by allen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and the inference that ultracold co exists in some spiral arm dustlanes where neither co nor hi have been detected in spite of a large dust extinction ( m83 : allen , atherton & tilanus 1985 ; tilanus & allen 1993 ; m51 : tilanus & allen 1989 ; m100 : rand 1995 ; m81 : allen et al .",
    "1997 ) lead us to wonder about the form of the initial mass function ( imf ) for any stars that are born at such low temperatures . here",
    "we propose that star formation in ultracold gas is biased towards brown dwarfs , and we show that these objects , along with the stars that are likely to form with them , could have escaped detection up to now because they do not heat the gas enough to raise the temperature to normal levels , nor do they appear as stellar objects in existing images .    in the solar neighborhood ,",
    "brown dwarfs are so uncommon that the imf can not continue to rise below about @xmath16 m@xmath6 ( zuckerman & becklin 1992 ; pound & blitz 1993 , 1995 ; reid & gazis 1997a , b ) .",
    "the number of possible brown dwarfs is consistent with an extension of the imf flattening seen between @xmath17 m@xmath6 and 0.4 m@xmath6 ( reid 1998 )",
    ". the relative number of brown dwarfs could be much higher in the ultracold gas of m31 , however .",
    "the detection of numerous brown dwarfs there would be an important confirmation of recent imf models .",
    "the imf is observed to be remarkably uniform from region to region in any one galaxy ( see reviews in massey 1998 ; elmegreen 1999a ) , covering star formation that spans a factor of @xmath18 in density ( massey & hunter 1998 ; luhman & rieke 1998 ) and a factor of @xmath19 in metallicity ( freedman 1985 ; massey , johnson & degioia - eastwood 1995 ) .",
    "it is also about the same in different hii regions in various galaxies ( bresolin & kennicutt 1997 ) , and in many different galaxies on average ( kennicutt , tamblyn & congdon 1994 ) , as indicated by the equivalent widths of hydrogen emission lines .",
    "detailed studies of color magnitude diagrams in the lmc and local dwarf galaxies give the same imf too ( greggio et al .",
    "1993 ; marconi et al . 1995 ; holtzman et al . 1997 ; grillmair et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "there is apparently some uniformity in the imf with time also , because stars with a wide range of ages in our galaxy all have about the same function , as suggested by halo stars ( nissen et al .",
    "1994 ) , and globular cluster stars ( de marchi & paresce 1997 ) .",
    "similarly , a nearly universal imf was found from abundance ratios ( e.g. , fe / o , reflecting the ratio of low mass to high mass supernova processing ) in qso damped ly@xmath20 ( lu et al .",
    "1996 ) and ly@xmath20 forest ( wyse 1998 ) lines , the intracluster medium ( renzini et al . 1993 ; wyse 1997 , 1998 ; but see loewenstein & mushotzky 1996 ) , and elliptical galaxies ( see review in wyse 1998 ) .",
    "an imf biased towards high - mass stars has been suggested for starburst regions , based on the ratio of luminous to dynamical mass ( rieke et al .",
    "1980 , 1993 ; kronberg , biermann , & schwab 1985 ; wright et al . 1988 ) , galactic evolution models ( doane & matthews 1993 ) , spectroscopic line ratios ( doyon , joseph , & wright 1994 ; smith et al . 1995 ) , and infrared excesses ( smith , herter & haynes 1998 ) .",
    "however , a lower extinction correction for m82 makes the imf there normal ( devereux 1989 ; satyapal et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ) , and more recent evolutionary models ( schaerer 1996 ) , multiwavelength spectroscopy and broad - band infrared photometry ( calzetti 1997 ) , and emission line spectroscopy ( stasiska & leitherer 1996 ) give normal imfs too .",
    "large imf shifts in starburst galaxies should also produce unobserved red populations of stars after the turnoff age reaches the stellar lifetime at the truncation mass ( charlot et al .",
    "1993 ) , and too high an oxygen abundance ( wang & silk 1993 ) .",
    "an imf shift towards lower mass stars has been reported for the extreme field by massey et al .",
    "however , this result could also come from a normal imf in each star - forming region if massive stars form preferentially in high mass clouds and stop further star formation when they do ( elmegreen 1999b ) .",
    "the extreme field imf can not be typical , because the imfs in most clusters and associations are about the same as the galaxy - integrated imfs .",
    "there are also imf dips , gaps , and a @xmath21 cluster - to - cluster variation in the power law slope ( scalo 1998 ) , but such variations are expected statistically given the small numbers of stars that are usually included in cluster studies ( elmegreen 1999b ) .",
    "there are few theoretical predictions of imf variations .",
    "fabian ( 1994 ) predicted that the imf would be biased towards low mass stars at the cores of galaxy cluster cooling flows because of the low jeans mass that results from the expected high pressures there .",
    "larson ( 1999 ) proposed that a top - heavy imf in the early universe could explain the g - dwarf problem , the high temperature and high metal abundance of intracluster gas , and the large luminosities of young elliptical galaxies .",
    "neither of these predictions have been directly confirmed , however .    in what follows",
    ", we discuss the possible dependence of the minimum stellar mass on cloud temperature and pressure .",
    "first we discuss the minimum mass on general terms , and then we apply the results to ultracold clouds in m31 .",
    "a lower mass limit is required for star formation because cloud pieces in pre - stellar clouds extend down to masses much smaller than the smallest stellar mass . clumps with masses as low as @xmath22 m@xmath6 have been observed in great abundance as part of the normal , power - law clump mass function in the polaris spur ( heithausen et al .",
    "1998 ; kramer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this means that the stellar mass range is only a small part of the total mass range for cloud clumps , and that there must be some physical process which limits the stellar mass at the low end .",
    "one possibility is that the minimum stellar mass is proportional to the thermal jeans mass , @xmath23 for temperature @xmath1 and cloud - core pressure @xmath2 . in this model ,",
    "cloud pieces much smaller than @xmath24 are not likely to become stars because they are not strongly self - gravitating ( larson 1992 ; elmegreen 1997 , 1999b )",
    ".    the mass of a star that actually forms in such a minimum unstable cloud piece can be smaller than @xmath24 , perhaps by a factor of 10 , because not all of the gas goes into stars , and because the resulting stellar system could be binary , in which case the stars would have to share the clump mass .",
    "for this reason , @xmath24 , or some factor of order unity times @xmath24 , is identified with the mass at the break point in the imf , where the power law first becomes flat , not with the minimum mass of a star .",
    "this is because the model predicts only a fundamental change in the physical properties of cloud clumps at this mass , but does not specify how the stars actually form inside the clumps . indeed , stellar masses are often observed to continue down to at least one - quarter of the mass of the break point , but such stars are not as common as would be expected from an extrapolation of the salpeter power - law function .    the expression for @xmath24 is the bonner - ebert condition for stability of a non - magnetic , pressure - bounded isothermal sphere . magnetic forces increase this critical mass ( e.g. , mouschovias & spitzer 1976 ) , so they should not be included in the minimum value .",
    "also , the mass - to - flux ratio varies in a turbulent cloud as a result of random compressions and magnetic diffusion , so regions with large mass - to - flux ratios will develop spontaneously and systematically over time , suggesting again that equation ( [ eq : mj ] ) , without magnetic fields , is the proper condition ( see also nakano 1998 ) .",
    "the numerator in @xmath24 contains the thermal temperature , rather than the turbulent rms speed , because turbulence increases the critical mass , and because the smallest stars will generally form on such small scales that the relative turbulent speed is less than the sound speed anyway .",
    "the pressure in the expression for @xmath24 is the total pressure at the boundary of the isothermal sphere .",
    "this pressure is not well defined for a real cloud because it comes partly from turbulent interclump motions and partly from thermal pressure in the interclump and overlying media ( e.g. , hunter & fleck 1982 ; ballesteros - paredes , vazquez - semadeni & scalo 1999 ) . the value of it for any particular cloud is not well defined either because pressure varies from place to place .",
    "nevertheless , the total pressure is much more uniform in a cloud than either the turbulent or the thermal pressures alone , which interchange roles during transient compressions , and also more uniform than the density because of the larson ( 1981 ) scaling relations , which make @xmath25 constant for density @xmath26 and rms speed @xmath27 . in taurus - like clouds , @xmath28 k@xmath29 , in gmcs , @xmath30 k@xmath29 , and in cluster - forming gmc cores , @xmath31 k@xmath29 .",
    "these differences in @xmath2 suggest that the imf may differ as well , which means that the lowest - mass stars might be smaller in gmcs than in taurus - like clouds .",
    "any such differences would not be large , however , because of the square root dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath2 .",
    "small imf differences would not have been recognized either .",
    "most stars form in gmcs under similar conditions , so their local imfs are similar .",
    "where the conditions differ , as in taurus , there are too few stars to get an accurate imf .",
    "in addition , the expected decrease in the mass at the peak of the imf for dense gmc cores is offset by stellar mass segregation ( a concentration of massive stars near the center ) and by a slightly increased temperature from nearby ob stars .",
    "strong variations in @xmath24 are not expected on a galactic scale either .",
    "the numerator in @xmath24 is roughly proportional to the cloud cooling rate and the denominator is roughly proportional to the background galactic heating rate from stars and cosmic rays ( elmegreen 1997 ; 1999b ) .",
    "thus molecular clouds in equilibrium will all have about the same @xmath24 , as long as the galactic mass - to - light ratio is about the same ( expected variations in the imf with m / l are discussed in elmegreen 1999c ) .",
    "the transition from the power law part of the imf to the low - mass turnover should contain important information about the star formation process , unlike the power - law part itself , which theory suggests contains only information about hierarchical cloud structure , i.e. , about the initial conditions for star formation .",
    "the mathematical form for this transition , i.e. , the way in which the lower mass limit actually affects the shape of the imf , can not be determined from theory yet .",
    "we have approximated this form simply by writing a probability @xmath32 that a cloud piece fails to form a star on a time scale comparable to its internal crossing time .",
    "the functional form of this probability is unknown ( cf .",
    "[ eq : imffun ] ) , so the exact value of the minimum critical mass can not be known yet either . differences of a factor of three in the definition for @xmath24 can easily be compensated by differences in the form of @xmath32 . nevertheless the concept that thermal pressure in a star - forming cloud ultimately limits the mass of a star is an essential part of the model , and leads to a characteristic mass at the low end of the imf that should scale with @xmath33 .",
    "the lower mass limit comes from another source in an alternative imf model , which follows from ideas by larson ( 1982 ) and shu , adams , & lisano ( 1987 ) , namely , that protostellar winds limit the accretion onto a star and thereby set the final stellar mass at a value close to the lower limit necessary to drive such a wind ( nakano , hasegawa , & norman 1995 ; adams & fatuzzo 1996 ) .",
    "the wind - limited mass is not the same as the deuterium - burning limit itself , which is about 0.018 m@xmath6 ( dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ) .",
    "the lower stellar mass in this theory comes from a combination of the deuterium limit and the accretion rate , @xmath34 , for sound speed @xmath35 ( shu , adams , & lisano 1987 ) .",
    "higher accretion rates require stronger winds and more massive stars before the accretion stops .",
    "this sensitivity to accretion rate makes the lower mass limit depend on temperature in an analogous way to @xmath24 , so that lower temperature clouds are likely to produce lower mass stars in the wind - limited accretion model too .",
    "the exact form of this temperature dependence and whether there is a pressure dependence are not known .",
    "an important difference between these two models is that the random - sampling model assumes that stellar mass is determined mostly by the pre - stellar clump mass .",
    "then the imf comes simply from random selection of these clumps in a certain order ( densest ones first ) .",
    "there is , in fact , growing evidence that the stellar mass is determined by the pre - stellar clump mass ( casoli et al . 1986 ; myers , ladd , & fuller 1991 ; myers & fuller 1993 ; pound & blitz 1993 , 1995 ; motte , andr , & neri 1998 ; testi & sargent 1998 ) , and not by wind - limited accretion in a large reservoir .",
    "the assumption of stellar mass proportional to clump mass is reasonable if even a modest fraction , e.g. , @xmath36% , of a clump s mass goes into the stars it forms , because then the total variability in possible stellar mass for a given clump mass is much less than the total mass range of the imf , which is a factor of 1000 . in this case",
    "most of the imf has to come from clump mass variations and not from variations in the star - to - clump mass fraction .",
    "moreover , even if a random and small fraction of a clump s mass gets into a star and the rest goes away in a wind or dispersed disk , the stellar mass will still be proportional to the clump mass and the imf will be unchanged ( elmegreen 1999b ) if the average of this fraction is about constant .    given these differences between the two imf models , the primary way to distinguish between them is to determine the fraction of the clump mass that goes into stars . if this fraction is either constant or relatively large ( larger than the inverse of the total mass range for stars )",
    ", then the imf must be tracing the pre - stellar clump spectrum in some way .",
    "imf models with a minimum stellar mass that depends on the thermal temperature and pressure in the star - forming cloud predict that ultracold gas in the inner disk of m31 ( allen et al .",
    "1995 ) should produce a great abundance of brown dwarfs .",
    "this gas is located in the inner disk of m31 , in the midst of the large , dark dust features studied by hodge ( 1980 ) .",
    "the surface density of stars is comparable to or higher there than it is locally because it is at a smaller galactocentric radius than the sun , and the surface density of the dark co clouds is higher than the local average too .",
    "thus the pressure in the cloud cores , and perhaps in the average interstellar medium at this radius too , is larger than it is locally , by the product of the ratios of these two surface densities .",
    "this pressure change lowers @xmath24 by about a factor of 3 compared to the value of @xmath24 for local star formation in molecular clouds .",
    "usually such a pressure increase is accompanied by a larger stellar volume emissivity and cosmic ray flux in these inner disks , both of which increase @xmath1 along with @xmath2 .",
    "but in m31 , the stellar blue surface brightness and the non - thermal radio continuum flux are lower than in the inner milky way , probably as a result of the earlier hubble type for m31 .",
    "this implies that radiative and cosmic ray heating rates are low , so the molecular gas equilibrates at a lower temperature , around @xmath37 k ( allen et al .",
    "1995 ; loinard & allen 1998 ) . in that case",
    ", there is a factor of @xmath38 drop in the temperature of potential star - forming material for the ultracold co gas in m31 , and , when combined with the expected higher pressure , a resulting net decrease in @xmath24 by a factor of @xmath39 .",
    "this gives a value of @xmath40 in the inner disk dark clouds of m31 .",
    "if the pressure is the same in the cloud cores as it is locally , then @xmath41 m@xmath6 . observation of a significant population of @xmath42 m@xmath6 stars and brown dwarfs in the inner dark clouds of m31 would therefore support theories of the imf based on either the thermal jeans mass limit or the thermal accretion rate limit for the lowest mass star .",
    "the random sampling model also predicts that the slope of the imf above the thermal jeans mass should be independent of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and other cloud properties since clouds presumably partition themselves in a standard way by turbulence ( for a discussion of cloud structure and turbulence , see falgarone , phillips & walker 1991 ) .",
    "we expect the same salpeter slope , namely , @xmath43 on a @xmath44 plot , for stars with @xmath45 m@xmath6 in the m31 inner dark clouds as we find in the intermediate to high mass parts of the imf measured locally .",
    "a simulation showing this independence between the high - mass slope and @xmath24 was shown by figure 4 in elmegreen ( 1997 ) .",
    "thus _ the random sampling model predicts that the imf in ultracold clouds should be exactly shifted towards lower mass without any change in the slope of the power - law part . _",
    "the observed imf can be approximated by the function @xmath46 for constant @xmath47 and for @xmath20 in the range from 1 to 2 ; @xmath48 for an imf that flattens at low mass , and @xmath49 for an imf that turns over at low mass .",
    "there are only a few observations yet of a low mass turnover on a @xmath44 plot ( reid & gazis 1997 ; hillenbrand 1997 ; nota et al . 1998 ) , but numerous observations show a flattening . note that there are usually many stars in this flattened region , and that the minimum stellar mass can be as low as one - quarter the mass at the turnover point . in the model , @xmath20 appears only in the probability for failure to form a star ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : imffun ] ) can be integrated to give the total stellar mass in various mass ranges .",
    "if @xmath11 m@xmath6 and the brown dwarf limit is @xmath51 m@xmath6 , then 0.479 of all the mass @xmath9 will be between @xmath24 and @xmath52 .",
    "_ approximately half the stellar - like mass down to the peak in the imf would be in the form of brown dwarfs . _",
    "the formation of a sufficiently large density of brown dwarfs in an ultracold co cloud could raise the gas temperature and make it more `` normal . ''",
    "the energy input required to heat a molecular cloud to @xmath19k is about @xmath53 erg @xmath54 s@xmath55 for molecular density @xmath56 ( neufeld , lepp & melnick 1995 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a ratio of luminosity to mass equal to @xmath57 erg s@xmath55 g@xmath55 .",
    "if the ratio of the stellar luminosity that heats the gas divided by the gas mass , @xmath58 , from brown dwarfs and other young stars is close to this , then the gas would not be supercold .",
    "a typical @xmath59 for pre - main sequence brown dwarfs is @xmath17 in these units ( dantona & mazzitelli 1994 ) , so if the star formation efficiency is 1% and a high fraction of the stellar radiation heats the gas , then the stellar luminosity per unit total mass would be 0.01 erg s@xmath55 g@xmath55 , which is 16 times larger than the ratio needed to heat the cloud to 10k .",
    "most embedded stellar radiation does not go into the gas directly , though , it goes into the dust which radiates it away in the ir .",
    "the dust luminosity scales approximately with dust temperature as @xmath60 ( e.g. , hollenbach & mckee 1979 ) , and a typical cold dust temperature in m31 is @xmath61 k ( haas et al .",
    "if the dust and gas are thermally coupled in ultracold co clouds , then the dust luminosity has to be less in @xmath38k clouds than it is locally by a factor of about @xmath62 .",
    "the background radiation field in m31 is brighter than @xmath63 times the local value , so the dust and gas can not be well coupled in the m31 ultracold co clouds .",
    "this means that the average gas density in these clouds is much less than @xmath64 @xmath54 .",
    "the density will be higher than this in star - forming cores , but these are shielded from outside light by dust , so the core dust temperature should be low there .",
    "the likely range for the average cloud density can be estimated from the inclination - corrected column density of @xmath65 m@xmath6 pc@xmath66 ( loinard & allen 1998 ) . considering a typical cloud projected size of @xmath65 pc ,",
    "the cloud thicknesses are probably somewhere between @xmath17 pc if they are thin shells , and @xmath65 pc , the thickness of the galaxy .",
    "this puts the average cloud density between 1 and 100 m@xmath6 pc@xmath67 , which corresponds to a molecular hydrogen density of 151500 @xmath54 .",
    "this is consistent with the result of loinard , allen & lequeux ( 1995 ) , who estimated a density of @xmath65 @xmath54 from co line ratios .",
    "thus the average density is indeed too low for thermal coupling between the gas and dust .    a better way to determine",
    "if embedded brown dwarfs can significantly heat ultracold co is to compare the summed luminosities of these stars to the incident and embedded luminosity from field stars .",
    "if the brown dwarf luminosity in the clouds is less than the total absorbed field star power , then the clouds would not show any excess emission in either dust or gas from the embedded young stars .",

    "if the largest pre - main sequence or stellar mass that can be hidden in and around the ultracold co clouds in m31 is @xmath99 m@xmath6 , then the total mass of all the brown dwarfs+stars has to be less than @xmath100 m@xmath6 .",

    "this number of @xmath102 hidden brown dwarfs in ultracold co clouds may seem large compared to what has been found so far in the solar neighborhood , but the associated number of normal stars and the total mass in the form of stars or brown dwarfs is remarkably small for such a cloud with an estimated @xmath89 m@xmath6 of gas ( loinard & allen 1998 ) .",
    "if the efficiency of star+brown dwarf formation is anything like it is locally , namely @xmath105% , then so many stars should have formed that the imf would have sampled out far enough into the high mass tail to produce o - type stars , which would be seen easily .",
    "this implies that star formation is unusually inefficient in the m31 ultracold co clouds .",
    "one possible explanation for this is that the clouds are much less dense than the excitation densities given by loinard & allen ( 1998 ) .",
    "these authors found , on the basis of excited - state co line ratios , that the gas is optically thick in the 3 - 2 , 2 - 1 , and 1 - 0 @xmath106co lines . in that case , the density required for excitation is less by the factor @xmath107 for opacity @xmath108 than the density that makes the collision rate equal to the spontaneous transition rate @xmath47 .",
    "thus the molecular density can be @xmath19 times less than their estimate , and the clouds much less strongly self - gravitating .",
    "if the clouds are like galactic translucent clouds , they may form no stars at all ( e.g. , hearty et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we can use the example provided by m31 to estimate the importance of brown dwarf formation generally .",

    "suppose also that half the stellar - like mass goes into brown dwarfs and that the ages of the ultracold clouds are at least @xmath111 years , which is a modest fraction of the shear time in the inner disk m31 .",
    "then the brown dwarf formation rate is @xmath112 m@xmath6 my@xmath55 per @xmath110 m@xmath6 of ultracold gas .",
    "this implies a gas consumption time that is very large , @xmath113 years , which means hardly any conversion of gas into stars or brown dwarfs in a hubble time . to get a significant mass in brown dwarfs , the efficiency of star formation has to be larger than this by a factor of @xmath65 , but then the resulting luminosity would heat an ultracold cloud to normal temperatures , shutting off brown dwarf production in favor of regular stars .",
    "the formation of brown dwarfs in ultracold gas requires a negligible mass of normal stars so the gas remains cold .",
    "this would occur naturally in the lowest mass clouds from an ensemble of clouds if the stars formed randomly .",
    "for example , if the maximum total mass that can form in a cloud before a massive star is likely to heat the gas is @xmath65 m@xmath6 , from figure 2 , and if the efficiency is large , 10% , then the clouds that make brown dwarfs have to be smaller than @xmath114 m@xmath6 .",
    "such small clouds are rarely isolated , however , and nearby gas can still make massive stars that provide heat . thus is it unlikely brown dwarfs can form with a significant total mass if the imf is simply shifted towards a lower peak mass with a salpeter spectrum above this .",
    "an upper mass cutoff in star formation , which is not present in the theory , would seem to be necessary if brown dwarfs are ever found to dominate the mass in a region .",
    "the ultracold clouds in m31 provide a good test for theories of the imf . because of their low temperatures and normal - to - high pressures",
    ", these clouds should have a thermal jeans mass of only @xmath115 m@xmath6 , making the imf shift towards lower mass with the same slope at higher mass . in that case",
    ", ultracold clouds should produce half of their stellar - like mass in the form of brown dwarfs .",
    "if the total number of such dwarfs per cloud is @xmath116 , then they and their accompanying h - burning stars would not significantly heat the cloud , nor be visible in existing surveys . a deep k - band search for brown dwarfs in ultracold gas",
    "would be necessary to see them .",
    "considering the luminosities of such pre - main sequence stars found locally , which is @xmath117 mag dereddened ( luhman et al .",
    "1998 ) , the k band luminosity of such a star in m31 would be @xmath118 mag plus extinction .",

    "<S> a recent model for the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , in which the stellar masses are randomly sampled down to the thermal jeans mass from hierarchically structured pre - stellar clouds , predicts that regions of ultra - cold co gas , such as those recently found in nearby galaxies by allen and collaborators , should make an abundance of brown dwarfs with relatively few normal stars . </S>",
    "<S> this result comes from the low value of the thermal jeans mass , which scales as @xmath0 for temperature @xmath1 and pressure @xmath2 , considering that the hierarchical cloud model always gives the salpeter imf slope above this lower mass limit . </S>",
    "<S> the ultracold co clouds in the inner disk of m31 have @xmath3k and pressures that are probably @xmath4 higher than in the solar neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a mass at the peak of the imf equal to @xmath5 m@xmath6 , well below the brown dwarf limit of @xmath7 m@xmath6 . using a functional approximation to the imf given by @xmath8 ^ 2}\\right ) m^{-1.35}d\\log m$ ] for @xmath9 , which fits the local imf for the expected value of @xmath10 m@xmath6 </S>",

    "<S> for typical star - formation efficiencies of @xmath13% , brown dwarfs and any associated stars up to @xmath14 m@xmath6 should not heat the gas noticeably , but if the imf continues up to arbitrarily high masses , then the star formation efficiency has to be @xmath15 to avoid heating from massive stars .    </S>",
