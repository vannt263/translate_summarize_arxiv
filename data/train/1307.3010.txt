    "the early universe is a good laboratory for high - energy physics because the temperature can be much higher than the reach of the accelerator experiments .",
    "thus we may be able to probe high - energy physics by observing some relics of the hot early universe .",
    "the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) carries rich information on the primordial density perturbation , which is considered to be generated during inflationary era .",
    "hence the precise observation of cmb gives a clue to inflation models ; it is a great success of cosmology for probing high - energy physics .",
    "however , it is rather unknown what have happened in the era between the inflation and the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . to go beyond ,",
    "one of the promising such relics that carry direct information on the early universe is the gravitational waves ( gws ) , since gws propagate without interfered by matter and radiation . in this paper , we focus on inflationary gws as a possible probe of the early universe .    the early universe may have experienced several drastic phenomena , which are not expected in the standard model ( sm ) , e.g. , phase transitions , entropy productions , production of weakly - interacting particles , etc .",
    "it is known that the spectrum of inflationary gws reflects the equation of state of the early universe as studied in refs .",
    "in particular , it is possible to determine or constrain the reheating temperature of the universe  @xcite with future space laser interferometers  @xcite .",
    "if there is a brief period of inflation ( other than the one responsible for the present density perturbations ) such as thermal inflation  @xcite , the spectrum exhibits a characteristic feature  @xcite .",
    "the effects of very weakly interacting relativistic particles , or dark radiation , on the gw spectrum were pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the presence of decaying matter into dark radiation ,",
    "the gw spectrum is deformed in a nontrivial way  @xcite .    in a realistic setup",
    ", the gw spectrum would be affected in a complicated way .",
    "for example , in the peccei - quinn ( pq ) model for solving the strong cp problem  @xcite , the pq phase transition may have occurred at around the cosmic temperature @xmath0@xmath1gev , and huge amount of entropy could have been released in association with the phase transition .",
    "relativistic axions may have been also efficiently produced by the decay of the pq scalar condensate , which would contribute as dark radiation .",
    "all these phenomena significantly affect the spectrum of inflationary gws .",
    "in other words , it may be possible to access the high - energy phenomena and underlying physical processes by studying the detailed spectrum of inflationary gws .",
    "in this paper we study the inflationary gw spectrum in detail in various setups having concrete models in mind .",
    "the combinations of above mentioned effects make several characteristic features in the spectra , which enable us to infer information on the early universe phenomena .",
    "first we review basic properties of gws in sec .",

    "the total energy density of the universe , @xmath9 , generally include @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the vacuum , matter , ( visible ) radiation and dark radiation energy densities , respectively.in this paper , we call the energy density with @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 being the equation - of - state parameter ) `` vacuum energy .

    "the radiation energy density @xmath15 is related to the cosmic temperature @xmath16 as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the relativistic degrees of freedom . unless otherwise stated , we use @xmath19 , which is the value in the minimal supersymmetric ( susy ) standard model ( mssm ) at high enough temperature .",
    "the amounts of other components depend on the particle physics model and there can be energy transfers among these components .",

    ", we also present the gw spectrum for the long wavelength modes entering the horizon at the md era : @xmath393 where @xmath394 is the density parameter of the matter at present . by using @xmath395mpc@xmath396",
    ", we thus obtain the interpolation formula from @xmath397 to @xmath398 as @xmath399 which is equivalent to the expression given e.g. in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section we derive the gw spectrum with a brief period of thermal inflation .      first note that if the universe is dominated by some matter whose equation of state is @xmath14 , the total energy density and the hubble parameter evolves as @xmath400 therefore , the scale factor at which the mode with wavenumber @xmath59 enters the horizon is given by @xmath401 for @xmath402 , the mode exits the horizon at @xmath403        now let us consider the case where the equation of state changes as @xmath69 with @xmath404 and @xmath71 as in the case of thermal inflation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ah ] ) .",
    "we want to evaluate the gw spectrum at late time @xmath405 .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath409 : in this case , the mode experiences the horizon entry and horizon exit , and again enters the horizon .",
    "first , the spectrum at @xmath410 is given by @xmath411 next , at @xmath412 it becomes @xmath413 finally , at late time @xmath154 , we have @xmath414 in summary , @xmath415 ( iii ) @xmath416 : in the short - wavelength limit , we obtain @xmath417 collecting the above results , we finally arrive at @xmath418 note that @xmath419 . here",
    "@xmath420 and @xmath120 are the comoving hubble scale at the beginning of thermal inflation and that at the end of thermal inflation ( or at the phase transition ) , respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ah ] ) .",
    "thus in the case of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we obtain the gw spectrum @xmath421 therefore , in the intermediate frequency region , the spectrum is proportional to @xmath212 ( see fig .  [ fig_pt_rd_twin ] ) .",
    "similarly , for @xmath422 and @xmath74 , we have @xmath423 for @xmath424 .",
    "[ fig_pt_md ] shows the gw spectrum for the case where the universe is matter dominated before thermal inflation and the vacuum energy instantly goes to radiation after the phase transition , with varying the ratio of matter energy density to the vacuum energy at the phase transition .",
    "it is seen that the spectrum scales as @xmath425 for @xmath426 .",
    "although the above arguments give global picture of the gw spectral shape , actually there appear an oscillatory feature in the gw spectrum for @xmath424 , which is not seen for @xmath427 and @xmath428 ( see e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig_pt_rd_twin ] ) .",
    "below we see more detail on the oscillatory feature of the gw spectrum .",
    "the gw with modes @xmath424 experience additional `` horizon exit '' and `` horizon entry '' processes compared with other modes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ah ] ) .",
    "let us denote the value of @xmath429 and its time derivative at this horizon exit by @xmath430 and @xmath431 .",
    "note that , although they take different values for different @xmath59 since they are oscillating , the combination @xmath432 ^ 2 + ( k / a)^2 [ h(t_{\\rm ex } , k , \\lambda)]^2 $ ] is roughly the same for different @xmath59 .",
    "after the horizon exit , the equation of motion of gws is approximated by @xmath433 the general solution of which is given by @xmath434 where coefficients @xmath435 and @xmath436 are determined by the boundary condition at the horizon exit",
    ". then we find @xmath437 therefore the part of the gw energy density proportional to @xmath438 at the horizon exit soon damps . the modes with @xmath439 appear to be peaks in the gw spectrum .",
    "on the other hand , the modes satisfying @xmath440 give troughs in the gw spectrum .",
    "thus we expect oscillatory features in the gw spectrum for @xmath441 in the case of thermal inflation .",
    "first we consider the case where the universe was rd dominated before thermal inflation .",
    "we solve the friedmann equation @xmath442,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript `` ref '' denotes some reference time before the phase transition , to get @xmath443 where @xmath444 here we have assumed that the inflation diluted the radiation enough . in the following we consider gws which are well - inside around the vacuum - energy domination and well - outside the horizon at the phase transition .",
    "the variable @xmath445 at the phase transition is @xmath446^{1/4 } \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{(1+x^2)^{1/2}x^{1/2 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{k}{a_{\\rm pt}h_{\\rm pt } } f_{\\rm r , pt}^{-1/4 } \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{(1+x^2)^{1/2}x^{1/2 } } , \\label{eq_upt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath447 and @xmath448 is the energy fraction of radiation at the phase transition .",
    "the oscillation peaks appear with the period of @xmath449 in @xmath450 , with wavenumbers of our interest goes out of the horizon during thermal inflation .",
    "one of the two solution to the equation of motion of gws soon damp outside the horizon ( see the previous subsection ) , and the peaks in the gw spectrum correspond to those wavenumbers which give maximal @xmath435 in .",
    "such wavenumbers appear with period @xmath449 in terms of @xmath451 ( here we denote `` horizon exit '' by `` he '' ) .",
    "the point is that @xmath451 is almost the same as @xmath450 , since by the same calculation as we find @xmath452 with @xmath453 given by @xmath454 one finds @xmath455 because both of the two factors @xmath456 and @xmath457 are much larger than 1 .",
    "note that @xmath458 although the gws are out of horizon at the phase transition . ]",
    "therefore the gap between two neighboring peaks is @xmath459 from this equation and @xmath460 we obtain @xmath461 in the case of md universe before thermal inflation , we follow the same procedure . solving the friedmann equation @xmath462,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "we get @xmath463 where @xmath464 then we get @xmath465^{1/3 } \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{(1+x^2)^{1/2}x^{2/3 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & \\simeq & \\frac{2}{3 } \\frac{k}{a_{\\rm pt}h_{\\rm pt } } f_{\\rm m , pt}^{-1/3 } \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{(1+x^2)^{1/2}x^{2/3}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath466 where @xmath467 is the energy fraction of matter at the phase transition .",
