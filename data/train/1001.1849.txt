    "a truly comprehensive understanding of magnetism at the nanoscale is still lacking and has important consequences in the technology of memory and information processing devices .",
    "many unsolved problems about magnetic properties of diluted spin systems attracted recently great attention . among the open problems",
    "there is the emergence of ferromagnetism in doped diluted systems@xcite , where the curie temperatures can be as high as @xmath0 k , and a deep theoretical understanding of the magnetic properties of dilute dipole systems ( spin glass transition , ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic transitions ) .    here",
    "we will concentrate on randomly arranged dilute classical dipoles , which are called dipole glasses .",
    "many results in literature , sometimes controversial , exist on such kind of systems .",
    "magnetic properties of dipole - dipole interacting spins are particularly difficult to study due to many factors : long range nature of the interaction , anisotropy and frustration .",
    "long range and anisotropy can induce ergodicity breaking@xcite in a system .",
    "breaking of ergodicity , a concept introduced by palmer@xcite , and recently found explicitly @xcite in a class of long - ranged anisotropic spin systems , is a key word to understand phase transitions too , even if it should not be confused with breaking of symmetry@xcite .",
    "speaking loosely , few constants of motion , such as the energy , or the angular momentum , in a particular geometry , produce a separation of the allowable phase space in two or more subspace over which the motion is constrained . in ref.@xcite",
    "the energy at which the separation occurs has been calculated explicitly for an anisotropic 1d classical heisenberg systems . in that case",
    "both the anisotropy and the long ranged nature@xcite of the inter - spin interaction , are essential ingredients in order to have breaking of ergodicity@xcite . on the other hand , frustration , that is the impossibility to attain a global minimal energy minimizing locally the interactions ,",
    "induces a dependence of the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic properties on the lattice geometry @xcite .",
    "other results concerning the so - called ising dipole glass can also be found in literature , where ising simply means uni - axial . to quote but a few : spin glass transition for high concentration , using monte carlo simulation@xcite , mean field spin glass transition at low concentration depending on the lattice geometry@xcite , absence of spin glass transition for low concentration using wang - landau monte carlo simulations @xcite or the recent spin glass transition at non zero temperature from extensive numerical simulation@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will focus our analysis on a dipole glass of freely rotating classical dipoles .",
    "first of all the dipole glass is a typical example of very frustrated system @xcite , so that different ground state configurations can exist depending on the geometry and the spin concentration .",
    "results in the canonical ensemble typically consider a mean field approach , and it is common lore that the random positions of the dipoles induce magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations do not vanish at @xmath1 , unlike thermal fluctuations , and tend to suppress magnetic order even at @xmath2@xcite .",
    "so , magnetic order , is expected to happen only for high impurity concentration ( and small temperature ) @xcite .",
    "mean field theories consider only the equilibrium properties and do not take into account the time needed to reach the equilibrium situation and finite size effects . on the other hand",
    "the question of how long a metastable state can last is a major issue in determining the magnetic properties of a system .",
    "in this paper we study the microcanonical dynamics , reserving the study of the influence of a thermal bath for further investigations .",
    "we analyze the microcanonical dynamics of dipoles put at the vertexes of a cubic lattice ( so that their relative distance can not be smaller than the lattice size ) , only on the basis of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations of motion .",
    "3d dipole - dipole interacting systems can be realized quite easily in laboratory , for instance doping a non magnetic media with paramagnetic ions , weakly interacting with the lattice and with an inter - dipole distance sufficiently large in order to neglect heisenberg interaction ( low concentration ) .",
    "the choice of studying a random glass instead of a system composed of dipoles regularly arranged in some lattice is twofold : from one hand is it relatively easy to dope a system putting some paramagnetic doping ions in a random way inside any non - magnetic media . on the other hand , a 3-d cubic lattice with a full concentration of dopant ions @xmath3",
    ", even if thin , does not have a ferromagnetic ground state @xcite , so that another type of transition should be considered ( paramagnetic / antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "anticipating some of the results , we have found that taking into account a typical experimental situation with needle - shaped sample , at low dipole concentration a further constant of motion appears that induce a kind of `` phase '' transition related to invariant tori , which separate the allowable phase space in many disconnected regions .",
    "this result seems to indicate that at very low concentration a system of random dipoles in a needle resemble a one dimensional arrangement of dipoles , and thus can have ferromagnetic behavior . in this particular case ,",
    "the ergodicity breaking is not due to an increase of energy , but to an increase of perturbation , which means the tendency to a transformation from a needle shape ( quasi 1d system ) to a cubic shape ( 3d shape ) . in a sense , these results are more akin to the standard perturbation theory in classical dynamical systems@xcite , re - interpreted in the light of phase transitions induced by demagnetization times @xcite .    in the future we are going to study the same system in contact with a thermal bath . in this case",
    "the presence of the ergodicity breaking found in @xcite should influence the demagnetization times . in the microcanonical case ,",
    "the presence of this ergodicity breaking is hidden by the quasi - integrability of motion .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath4 classical dipoles @xmath5 randomly put at the nodes of a 3d gridded box @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , and low concentration @xmath8 , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ zero ] ,    . @xmath9 and @xmath10 are given in units of the lattice size @xmath11 . ]    from the physical point of view it represents a dilute system of paramagnetic ions in a non magnetic bulk , with a concentration @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of allowable sites in the 3d lattice . as explained above , such a system can be realized in laboratory , doping a non  magnetic system having a cubic lattice with paramagnetic impurities ( e.g. doped @xmath14 and other@xcite ) .",
    "if the dipoles weakly interact with the lattice and if their average distance is much greater than the bohr radius , we can simply neglect the heisenberg ( exchange ) interaction and represent their mutual interaction and dynamics with a pure dipole - dipole interaction energy :    @xmath15 . \\label{en}\\ ] ]    here @xmath16 is the @xmath17th dimensionless spin vector @xmath18 @xmath19 is the magnetic moment of the paramagnetic doping ions and @xmath20 is the distance between the i - th and the j - th spin in units of the lattice spacing @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamics is described by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations of motion : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "they can be rewritten in the dimensionless form ,    @xmath24    where the following dimensionless quantities have been introduced : @xmath25    the system of equations ( [ llgd ] ) conserves the energy ( [ en ] ) and the squared modulii of the spins ( [ conm ] ) .",
    "the diluted quasi 1d system can be magnetized with a strong magnetic field directed along @xmath10 , the longest axis ( @xmath26-axis ) .",
    "the questions we would like to answer is the following : what is the dependence of the average demagnetization time and its fluctuations on the system parameters ?",
    "the relevant parameters to take into account are the concentration @xmath27 of paramagnetic ions and the aspect ratio @xmath28 . in principle , due to the long - ranged nature of the dipole interaction , one could ask whether there are effects dependent on both the system size and the number of doping spins @xmath4 , even if in quasi 1d systems , the dipole interaction can be treated as a short range interaction .    from the point of view of the equations of motion ( [ llgd ] ) ,",
    "if the @xmath4 dipoles are lying along a straight line ( @xmath29 , there is a further constant of motion , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , for a 1d system , the answer to the first question above is very simple : a state with any initial magnetization @xmath31 will keep the initial magnetization forever .",
    "the natural question thus becomes : what happens for @xmath32 ?",
    "will a magnetized state demagnetize and how much time it takes to do that ?    1truecm , for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , in the integrable case .",
    "initially spins are chosen with random components on the unit sphere .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    the classical dynamical picture can be simplified adopting a perturbative approach , namely approximating the unit versor between two spins as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the unit versors , @xmath39 are the azimuthal angles with respect the @xmath26-axis and @xmath40 are the polar angles . in the last equation we approximate @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where , for dilute dipoles in a needle goemetry , @xmath43 is the average distance among spins .",
    "the energy ( [ en ] ) , to first order in @xmath44 , becomes : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the energy part that conserve @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the perturbation , @xmath49\\\\ v & = & \\displaystyle -3   \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j\\ne i } \\frac{1}{|r_{ij}|^3 } \\left [",

    "therefore one could expect that for @xmath55 a rotational - like motion about the @xmath26axis persists , while @xmath47 remains a quasi constant of motion .",
    "this is what can be observed for instance by a direct inspection of the trajectories of the macroscopic vector @xmath56 , in the plane @xmath57 , see fig .",

    "the dynamical behavior of the system can be characterized by a `` regular region '' @xmath62 in which the magnetization @xmath63 is bounded in a small interval @xmath64 , while , for @xmath65 , @xmath63 quickly decays to zero . to be more precise , the transition across @xmath66 is smooth , namely there is a region of @xmath67 values in which the initial magnetization decay to some non zero constant when the time @xmath68 becomes large .",

    "in other words , in order to have less than one spin in each @xmath77 block one should have @xmath78 , or @xmath79 .    moreover the study of the dynamics done in the previous section suggests to take as a small parameter @xmath44 and to look for ferromagnetism when @xmath62 .",
    "note that this choice is also appropriate from the thermodynamic point of view since @xmath80 is an intensive parameter in the large @xmath4 limit @xmath81 , with @xmath9 fixed .",

    "indeed we can expect a weak dependence of the average magnetization on the simulation time @xmath110 , in the ferromagnetic region @xmath62 , since the presence of quasi - constant of motions freezes the magnetization , while , in the paramagnetic phase , the average magnetization at time @xmath110 , @xmath128 , goes to zero as the time grows .",

    "let us observe two relevant features .",
    "the first one is the presence of a change of curvature of both curves on approaching the critical border @xmath131 .",
    "the second is the scaling of all points in the two curves ( one for @xmath133 , the other for the remnant magnetization @xmath125 . )    as for the rescaling of the time , let us observe that , due to the particular quasi 1d geometry , and to the low concentration @xmath134 , closest dipoles give the major contribution to the energy .",
    "for instance , the configuration with all spins aligned along the @xmath26axis will have an energy , @xmath135 where the sum is taken over @xmath4 couples @xmath136 of neighbor dipoles .",
    "in other words @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the average distance between two dipoles .    on the other hand the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations of motion are invariant under a simultaneous scaling of time and energy @xmath139 and @xmath140 so that we will expect @xmath141 .",
    "this simple relation has been verified considering a system with the same aspect ratio @xmath59 , and the same number of particles @xmath4 ( so to have the same value of @xmath67 ) and changing the concentration @xmath27 over 3 orders of magnitude .",
