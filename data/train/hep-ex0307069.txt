    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations in both atmospheric and solar neutrinos and thus the establishment of neutrino mass has been one of the major advances in particle physics of the past decade .",
    "the evidence generally regarded as establishing neutrino oscillations was the observation by the super - kamiokande collaboration of a variation of the atmospheric neutrino event rate with zenith angle @xcite .",
    "solar neutrino oscillations have been confirmed by the sno experiment s measurement of the neutral current event rate @xcite and the detection of the disappearance of reactor neutrinos by kamland @xcite .",
    "the k2k experiment has provided supporting evidence for oscillations @xcite but there has been no detailed confirmation of the super - k effect in atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "observations of a deficit of atmospheric have been published by this experiment @xcite , and by kamiokande @xcite , imb @xcite and macro @xcite .",
    "the analysis reported here is the first independent confirmation of atmospheric neutrino oscillations using fully reconstructed neutrino interactions and covering the complete range of zenith angles .",
    "the data used are from the 5.90 fiducial kton - year exposure of the soudan  2 detector .",
    "soudan  2 was originally designed to study proton decay and thus has excellent resolution and pattern recognition properties in the visible energy region around 1 gev where the peak in the atmospheric neutrino event rate occurs .",
    "although the exposure of the experiment is less than that of super - k , the full event reconstruction , and thus good energy and direction resolution for the incident neutrino , compensates to some extent for the smaller number of events .",
    "the data are analyzed using an unbinned likelihood method based on the feldman - cousins prescription @xcite .",
    "the probability of the no oscillation hypothesis is @xmath3 .",
    "the 90% confidence allowed region in the @xmath2plane is determined and is consistent with that published by super - k .",
    "soudan 2 is a 963 metric ton ( 770 tons fiducial ) iron tracking calorimeter with a honeycomb geometry which operates as a time projection chamber .",
    "the detector is located at a depth of 2070 meters  water ",
    "equivalent on the 27th level of the soudan underground mine state park in northern minnesota .",
    "the calorimeter started data taking in april 1989 and ceased operation in june 2001 by which time a total exposure of 7.36 kton - years , corresponding to a fiducial exposure of 5.90 kton - years , had been obtained .    the calorimeter s active elements are 1 m long , 1.5 cm diameter hytrel plastic drift tubes filled with an argon - co@xmath4 gas mixture .",
    "the tubes are encased in a honeycomb matrix of 1.6  mm thick corrugated steel plates .",
    "electrons deposited in the gas by the passage of charged particles drifted to the tube ends under the influence of an electric field . at the tube",
    "ends the electrons were amplified by vertical anode wires which read out a column of tubes .",
    "a horizontal cathode strip read out the induced charge and the third coordinate was provided by the drift time .",
    "the ionization deposited was measured by the anode pulse height .",
    "the steel sheets are stacked to form 1@xmath51@xmath52.5 m@xmath6 , 4.3 ton modules from which the calorimeter was assembled in building - block fashion .",
    "more details of the construction of the detector and its properties can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "surrounding the tracking calorimeter on all sides but mounted on the cavern walls , well separated from the outer surfaces of the calorimeter , is a 1700 m@xmath7 active shield array of two or three layers of proportional tubes  @xcite .",
    "the shield tagged the presence of cosmic ray muons in time with events in the main calorimeter and thus identified background events , either produced directly by the muons or initiated by secondary particles coming from muon interactions in the rock walls of the cavern .",
    "calibration of the calorimeter response was carried out at the rutherford laboratory isis spallation neutron facility using test beams of pions , electrons , muons , and protons  @xcite .",
    "spatial resolutions for track reconstruction and for vertex placement in anode , cathode , and drift time coordinates are of the same scale as the drift tube radii , @xmath8 0.7 cm .",
    "soudan 2 has several advantages over water cherenkov detectors .",
    "images approaching the quality of bubble chamber events are obtained .",
    "ionizing particles having non - relativistic as well as relativistic momenta are detected via their energy loss in the gas .",
    "protons are readily distinguished from @xmath9 and @xmath10 tracks by their ionization and lack of multiple coulomb scattering .",
    "muons from charged current ( cc ) reactions are prompt tracks without secondary scatters .",
    "prompt e@xmath11 showers from cc reactions are distinguished from photon showers on the basis of their proximity to the primary vertex .",
    "since soudan  2 has no magnetic field and thus only limited charge identification , @xmath12 and @xmath13 reactions are not separated .",
    "two examples of the event definition provided by the detector are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : events ] .",
    "the event on the left is a quasi - elastic interaction producing a short proton and an electron which travels approximately one radiation length before showering .",
    "the event on the right is an inelastic interaction .",
    "the long non - interacting muon track is accompanied by a hadronic shower , including a charged pion and at least two gamma showers .",
    "the excellent imaging and particle identification offer good determination of the energy and direction of the incident neutrino and thus the path length from its production point in the atmosphere . especially advantageous",
    "is the reconstruction of quasi - elastic reactions , where the recoil proton is observed with approximately 40% efficiency , and complicated multiprong topologies .",
    "the correlation of the outgoing lepton direction and energy with the incident neutrino direction and energy is poor at low energies .",
    "improvements in the resolution of neutrino path length divided by energy , @xmath0 , by factors of 2 and 3 are readily obtained by reconstructing both the lepton and the hadronic final state .",
    "events are divided into two containment classes .    1 .",
    "_ events that are fully contained within the detector ( fce)_. containment is defined by the requirement that no portion of the event approaches closer than 20 cm to the exterior of the detector and that no particle in the event could enter or escape the detector through the space between modules . the containment criterion limits high energy events to those with a muon of energy less than around 1 gev .",
    "_ events that are partially contained , in which only the produced lepton exits the detector ( pce)_. these events recover a fraction of the high energy events rejected by the containment criterion .",
    "as the muon does not stop in the detector , its energy from range can not be measured .",
    "instead an estimate of the energy was obtained from the observed range , with a small added correction based on the amount of multiple scattering on the track .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) studies showed that the effect of the poorer energy measurement on the @xmath0resolution was small .",
    "since the timing resolution of soudan  2 is insufficient to determine the @xmath14 direction , a stopping , downward - going , cosmic ray muon could mimic an upward - going pce having little or no hadronic vertex activity .",
    "up - down asymmetric cuts on the exiting track and the event vertex properties are required to reduce this contamination to negligible proportions @xcite .",
    "two classes of events are defined on the basis of the presence or absence of hits in the veto shield .    1 .",
    "_ quiet shield events_. these events have no in - time hits in the veto shield except for those associated with the leaving lepton in pces .",
    "they are candidates for neutrino interactions but also contain a small background of events produced by cosmic ray muons .",
    "they will be called `` _ qs - data _ '' events . 2 .",
    "_ shield tagged events_. events initiated by the passage of a cosmic ray muon generally have in - time hits in the veto shield .",
    "the hits may be caused by the muon itself or by secondary charged particles from the interaction of the muon in the rock surrounding the detector .",
    "secondary neutral particles can enter the detector and interact , mimicking neutrino interactions .",
    "events flagged with in - time veto shield hits will be called `` _ rock _ '' events .",
    "the average shield efficiency for detection of a minimum ionizing particle was measured to be 94% .",
    "study of events with a single shield hit showed that the contamination of qs - data events by cosmic ray muons which pass through the shield and enter the detector is negligible .",
    "it was however possible for neutrons and gamma rays to enter the detector with no identifying shield hit when all of the charged particles associated with the production event in the rock passed outside the shield or were not detected due to shield inefficiency .",
    "these quiet shield rock events ( called `` _ qs - rock _ '' ) are a background to the neutrino sample .",
    "they may be statistically distinguished from neutrino events by the depth distribution of the interaction vertices , as described in sect .",
    "[ dataa ] .",
    "the background from qs - rock events is significantly different in low and high multiplicity events and in low multiplicity electron and muon samples .",
    "the fce data are thus further divided into topology classes .    1 .",
    "_ events with a single track - like particle with or without a recoil proton , called `` tracks''_. these are mostly quasi - elastic interactions and are assigned `` _ @xmath14-flavor _ '' .",
    "2 .   _ events with a single showering particle with or without a recoil proton called `` showers''_.",
    "these are mostly quasi - elastic interactions and are assigned `` _ e - flavor _ '' .",
    "events with multiple outgoing tracks and/or showers called `` multiprongs''_. these can be of either flavor . the flavor is assigned according to whether the highest energy secondary is a non - scattering track ( ) or shower ( ) . a small fraction of multiprongs have no muon or electron candidate and are defined as neutral current , _",
    "`` nc''_. a further small sample had no obvious flavor and are defined as ambiguous .",
    "the nc events are too few to provide constraints on the oscillation analysis but they and the ambiguous events are added into the event total , contributing to the flux normalization . through the rest of the paper , unless otherwise specified , the heading nc includes both neutral current and ambiguous events .      at low neutrino energies",
    "the correlation between the direction of the outgoing lepton and the incoming neutrino is poor .",
    "the ability of soudan  2 to reconstruct the recoil proton from quasi - elastic interactions and the low energy particles from inelastic reactions gives a major improvement in the neutrino pointing and energy resolution . to take advantage of this",

    "_ a low resolution `` lores '' sample _ , comprising all other events .      to avoid biases due to the scanning described in sect .  [ datap ] and to provide a blind analysis , monte carlo events were inserted into the data stream as the data were taken",
    "a monte carlo sample 6.1 times the expected data sample in this exposure , assuming no oscillations , was included .",

    "the event generation was carried out using the neugen package @xcite and the particle transport using gheisha @xcite and egs @xcite .",
    "the incident neutrino flux used in the generation of events was that provided by the bartol group at the start of the experiment @xcite .",

    "@xcite has also been used .",
    "the variation in the flux during the solar cycle was taken into account using measured neutron monitor data for normalization @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo events were superimposed on random triggers which represent the background noise in the detector , mostly low energy gammas from radioactive decays or electronic noise . this simulated the effect of random noise on the event recognition and reconstruction and the random vetoing of events ( 4.8% ) due to noise in the veto shield .",
    "the detector trigger rate was approximately 0.5 hz .",
    "about half of the triggered events were cosmic ray muons and half electronic noise or the sum of random low energy gamma radiation .",
