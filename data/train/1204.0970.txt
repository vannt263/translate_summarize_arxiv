    "the kondo effect is a prototypical many - body phenomenon that is caused by the interaction between a localized spin and conduction electrons . since the kondo effect was observed in a quantum dot ( qd )",
    "system,@xcite effects of electron correlation on quantum transport have attracted much attention . moreover",
    ", the recent experimental advancement enables one to examine the kondo physics in a variety of systems , such as an aharonov - bohm ring with a qd and double quantum dots ( dqd ) . in these systems",
    "multiple paths for electron propagation also affect the tunneling currents , and give rise to a fano - type asymmetry in the line shapes of conductance .    a side - coupled dqd system with a t - shape configuration , as shown in fig .",
    "[ modeltdqd ] , is a typical system in which the interplay between the kondo effect and the interference effect occurs . for this type of dqd , a number of theoretical studies",
    "have been carried out so far . @xcite",
    "it also becomes experimentally possible to fabricate this kind of geometry.@xcite in the side - coupled dqd system shown in fig .",
    "[ modeltdqd ] , one of the dots ( qd2 ) , which is referred to as a _ side dot _ , has no direct coupling to the leads , but is coupled to the _ embedded dot _ ( qd1 ) .",
    "because of this unique geometry with the multiple paths , intriguing phenomena can occur in this system . for example , a two - stage kondo effect can occur for the small interdot coupling @xmath1 , where each of the dots is occupied by a single electron .",
    "@xcite in this case , the local moment in the qd1 is screened first by the conduction electrons at higher temperature , and then the moment in the qd2 is screened at lower temperature to form a singlet ground state . most of the preceding studies of a side - coupled dqd system focused on the two - stage kondo effect taking place in this situation .",
    "in contrast , for large @xmath1 , the two adjacent local moments screen each other to form a molecular - type singlet .",
    "the gate voltage that is applied to the dots can further change the charge and spin distributions in the dqd , and evolve the system toward the mixed - valence regime . specifically , as the energy level @xmath2 of the qd1 is varied , another typical singlet state appears in the parameter region where the qd1 becomes almost empty or doubly occupied .",
    "it is a singlet bond between the local moment at qd2 and the conduction electrons , and is formed by a superexchange mechanism .",
    "some numerical indications that this type of singlet state is formed were seen in data of previous works.@xcite maruyama _ et al .",
    "_ obtained an asymmetric conductance peak of the fano shape for finite @xmath2 in the kondo regime.@xcite however , their study is focused mainly on the transport properties .",
    "@xcite examined a similar situation , and showed that the kondo temperature becomes small in this case .",
    "the precise features of the singlet state , however , were not fully examined .",
    "some groups have studied the gate - voltage dependence of the conductance where the energy levels of the two dots are moved simultaneously .",
    "@xcite however , it has still not been clarified in detail how the singlet ground state evolves across the crossover region between the singlet state due to the two - stage kondo effect and the one formed by the superexchange mechanism between the qd2 and the conduction electrons .    in this paper , we re - examine a side - coupled dqd system shown in fig .",
    "[ modeltdqd ] , and study how the kondo singlet bond is deformed as the energy level @xmath2 in the qd1 is changed .",
    "we find that as @xmath2 moves away from the fermi energy , the electrons at the qd1 can not contribute to the screening of the local moment at the qd2 , and the conduction electrons tunneling into the qd2 virtually via @xmath2 screen the local moment .",
    "this electron tunneling process is similar to the superexchange mechanism seen in transition metal oxides such as mno and cuo .",
    "@xcite in the present case , the kondo singlet bond is formed between the qd2 and the leads , mediated by the quantized level @xmath2 at the qd1 .",
    "this mechanism is quite different from the kondo screening in the case of @xmath3 where a singlet bond between the qd1 and qd2 plays a dominant role .",
    "@xcite therefore , the gate voltage applied to the qd1 deforms the kondo cloud , and it can be probed through the variation in the phase shift of the dqd . in order to clarify these features , we calculate the phase shift using the numerical renormalization group .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the spin susceptibility to obtain the kondo temperature , which shows good agreement with the one obtained from an effective kondo hamiltonian we have derived in this work . in the presence of the coulomb interaction @xmath4 at the qd1 , we also find that the two - stage kondo screening changes to a single - stage process as @xmath2 moves away from the electron - hole symmetric point @xmath5 .",

    "thus , the electrons at the qd1 can not contribute to the screening of the local moment at the qd2 , and @xmath2 works as a potential barrier that disturbs charge transfer between the qd2 and the leads .",

    "this term appears as the @xmath57-type contribution in the fourth order perturbation expansion with respect to tunneling elements .",
    "the screening of the local moment @xmath38 is achieved for large @xmath2 by the conduction electrons tunneling virtually through the qd1 .",
    "this screening mechanism is essentially the same as the one due to the superexchange interaction mentioned above , and the singlet bond becomes long compared to that in the case of @xmath3 .",

    "namely @xmath71 , both of the dots are nearly half - filled ( @xmath72 ) , and the phase shift takes the value of @xmath73 from eq .  . the singlet state is formed dominantly inside the dqd , and thereby the conduction electrons at the leads are not scattered by the local spin at the dots . as @xmath2 increases , @xmath68 shows a sharp drop around @xmath74 and approaches @xmath75 . from eq .",

    "we have also calculated the local spin susceptibility and have estimated the kondo temperature , which shows good agreement with that obtained from the effective kondo hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , we have demonstrated precisely how the two - stage kondo screening changes to a single - stage process as the energy level at the qd1 moves away from the electron - hole symmetric point .    in closing , we would like to make some comments on the se kondo screening .",
    "the scenario of the se kondo screening is not limited to our side - coupled dqd system , but is more generic for the anderson model where the impurity spin and the conduction electrons are connected via the discrete energy level . in usual cases of the kondo problem , a magnetic impurity is coupled directly to the conduction electrons , for instance , a bulk system with a magnetic impurity . on the other hand , in the two - impurity anderson model",
    "we have considered , a local spin moment is coupled indirectly to the conduction electrons via a discrete energy level .",
    "the resulting screening process shows a unique feature , which has clearly been demonstrated in this paper with the help of the effective kondo hamiltonians and the nrg method .",
    "the se kondo screening discussed in this paper also appears in a side - coupled dqd system coupled to normal and superconducting leads , which we have previously studied.@xcite in this case , the superconducting proximity to the embedded dot quenches the local spin moment because this proximity tends to make a singlet consisting of a linear combination of the empty and doubly occupied states .",
    "thus , the superconducting proximity to the embedded dot plays the role of a potential barrier between the side dot and the normal lead , which can cause the se kondo screening .",
    "recently , the side - coupled dqd system has been fabricated in experiments.@xcite we thus expect that in the near future , it may become possible to observe the se kondo screening discussed in this paper , providing further interesting examples of correlation effects in the context of electron transport in nanoscale systems .",

    "@xcite the unperturbed ground state is chosen to be the one for @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "in this situation , the ground state of the two - impurity anderson model defined in eq .   is described by the singly occupied state at the qd2 and the empty one at the qd1 .",
