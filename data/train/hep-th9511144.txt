    "<S> the problems of classical electrodynamics with the electron equation of motion and with non - integrable singularity of its self - field stress tensor are well known . </S>",
    "<S> they are consequences , we show , of neglecting terms that are null off the charge world line but that gives a non null contribution on its world line . </S>",
    "<S> the self - field stress tensor of a point classical electron is integrable , there is no causality violation and no conflict with energy conservation in its equation of motion , and there is no need of any kind of renormalization nor of any change in the maxwell s theory for this . </S>",
    "<S> + ( this is part of the paper hep - th/9510160 , stripped , for simplicity , of its non - minkowskian geometrization of causality and of its discussion about the physical meaning of the maxwell - faraday concept of field ) .        three unsolved problems @xcite make of classical electrodynamics of a point electron a non - consistent theory : 1 ) the field singularity in the lienard - wiechert solution ; 2 ) the non - integrable singularities of its stress tensor ; 3 ) the bizarre , causality violating behaviour of solutions of the lorentz - dirac equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the lorentz - dirac equation , @xmath0 is the greatest paradox of classical field theory as it can not simultaneously preserve both the causality and the energy conservation , although there is nothing in the premisses for its derivation that justify such violations . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the schott term , @xmath1 , is the cause of all pathological features of ( [ lordireq ] ) , like microscopic non - causality , runaway solutions , preacceleration , and other bizarre effects @xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the presence of this term is necessary for the maintenance of energy - momentum conservation ; without it it would be required a null radiance for an accelerated charge , as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the argument , although correct , that such causality violations are not observable because they are outside the scope of classical physics @xcite and are blurred @xcite by quantum - mechanics effects is not enough compelling , because these same problems remain in a quantum formalism , just disguised in other apparently distinct problems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + the presence of non - integrable singularities in the electron self - field stress tensor is also a major problem . </S>",
    "<S> previous attempts on taming these singularities have relied on modifications of the maxwell s theory with ad hoc addition of extra- terms to the field stress tensor on the electron world - line ( see for example the reviews @xcite ) ; it is particularly interesting that , as we will show here , instead of adding anything we should actually not drop out some null terms . </S>",
    "<S> is their contribution ( not null , in an appropriate limit ) that avoid the infinities . </S>",
    "<S> the same problem happens in the derivations of the electron equation of motion : they are done with incomplete field expressions that do not contain these terms that are null only off the particle world - line . </S>",
    "<S> the schott term in the lorentz - dirac equation is a consequence of this ; it does not appear in the equation when the full field expression is correctly used . </S>",
    "<S> + the solution to the first problem , which is in essence the origin of the second and third problems , involves a discussion of the meaning of the maxwell - faraday concept of field and requires an entirely new formalism based on an anticipated recognition , yet in a classical context , of the discrete and localized character of the electromagnetic interaction , which is proper of a quantum formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the solution to the second and to the third problems is easier to describe and just requires the knowledge of the model of spacetime geometry behind this new formalism . </S>",
    "<S> we will present here a simplified minkowskian version of it . </S>",
    "<S> the complete riemannian version and its relevance to quantum field theory and to the question of the origin and meaning of mass , is too long to be included in this letter . </S>",
    "<S> it is being discussed elsewhere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the immediate difference in the outcomes of these two versions appears in the equation of motion for a point electron , @xmath3 the last term on the lhs corresponds to the energy associated to the riemannian curvature of the electron manifold and it is not present in its minkowskian counterpart ( [ ffinally ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is not the lorentz - dirac equation as it does not contain the troublemaker third - order term . </S>",

    "<S> we must realize that the discontinuity , @xmath101 still remains . </S>",
    "<S> it is a consequence of the problem 1 ; its solution requires an understanding of the physical meaning of the maxwell - faraday concept of field in this context . </S>",

    "<S> let us move directly to the part that will produce novel results : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the external forces acting on the electron , and the last term represents the impulse carried out by the emitted electromagnetic field in the bhabha tube surrounding the electron world - line , defined by the heaviside function , @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> using the divergence theorem , we have that the last term of the rhs of ( [ eqm ] ) is transformed into @xmath107 this term represents the flux of 4-momentum through the cylindrical hypersurface @xmath108 let us denote it by @xmath109 : @xmath110 as @xmath111 and @xmath112 we can write @xmath113 with @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 and @xmath118 are both null . in order to show this we need to apply ( [ nr ] ) for a n(r ) with a generic form @xmath119 , where a , b , and c are functions of r , such that @xmath120 . </S>",
