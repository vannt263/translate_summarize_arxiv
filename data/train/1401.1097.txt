    "one of the conclusions of the ipcc ar4 ( 2007 ) is that cloud effects remain the largest sources of uncertainty in gcm based estimates of climate sensitivity , with large cloud radiative feedbacks associated with low - level clouds such as the marine stratocumulus .",
    "the increase in the realism of the modelling of clouds is also one of the key features for the improvement of the nwp models ( global or lam ones ) .",
    "different projects have already evaluated the quality of the three - dimensional distribution of clouds in the climate and nwp models ( eurocs : http://www.knmi.nl/samenw/eurocs/ ; gcss : http://www.gewex.org/gcss.html ) .",
    "the aim of the new european fp5 euclipse project ( http://www.knmi.nl/samenw/euclipse/ ) is to promote the comparisons with the new space - borne remote sensing dataset ( such as cloudsat , calipso , trmm ) and by realizing inter - comparisons between gcm , nwp , scm , crm and les outputs .",
    "the goal is to determine what are the main deficiencies in the parameterizations of clouds ( either for the stratiform , shallow or deep convective ones ) and to test more accurate updated schemes .",
    "it is also possible to revisit some aspects of the theoretical concepts which form the bases of our understanding of the moist atmospheric processes , such as the definition and the use of enthalpy , entropy or exergy functions . in particular",
    ", the comparison with the existing in - situ datasets could still be of some help in order to assess the different hypotheses presently made to build the turbulent and convective schemes .    in this frame",
    ", the pbl region of marine stratocumuli can be considered as a paradigm of the moist turbulence and it is of common use to realize vertical diffusion of the well - known `` conserved variables '' defined in betts ( 1973 , hereafter b73 ) .",
    "however , it seems that the in situ observations of the betts variables ( the liquid potential temperature and the total water content ) show that these variables are not constant vertically and that the clear - air and the in - cloud values are different ( see for instance the vertical profiles computed with the fire - i data set and published in de roode and wang , 2007 , hereafter rw07 ) .    the liquid potential temperature @xmath5 is defined in b73 with the aim of being a synonym of moist entropy .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 may be used in moist turbulent processes as a conserved variable only if the total water content is also a constant and these hypotheses might prevent @xmath5 from being a conservative quantity in case of varying dry - air and total water content , as clearly observed in the vertical profiles of stratocumulus in - situ measurements .",
    "one of the ways to answer these questions is to remember that , from the general thermodynamics , the moist entropy must be conserved by moist , reversible and adiabatic processes ( the ones acting in the moist pbl of stratocumulus ) .",
    "therefore , the aim of this paper will be to compute moist entropy and its associated potential temperature as precisely as possible , and to explain how it is indeed different from , and more interesting than , the betts liquid potential temperature .",
    "the use of potential temperatures , instead of entropy , has a long history in meteorology and the analysis will be made in this paper mainly in terms of a moist potential temperature , denoted by @xmath0 ( with `` s '' representing the moist entropy ) , in order to make the comparisons with all the existing ones easier .",
    "nonetheless , the main variable studied in this paper is clearly the moist entropy .    the moist potential temperature @xmath0 is expected to represent all the variations of moist entropy `` @xmath6 '' , whatever the changes in temperature , pressure , specific content of dry air , water vapour or condensed water species ( solid and liquid ) may be .",
    "this property would allow us to derive the same conservative properties for @xmath0 as the general ones valid for the moist entropy .",
    "the concept of what is nowadays called `` potential temperature '' in atmospheric science was first introduced by von helmholtz ( 1888 , 1891 ) , with the use of the name `` waermegehalt '' ( warming content ) and with the notation @xmath1 .",
    "the `` warming content '' of a given mass of air was defined as the absolute temperature @xmath1 which a mass of dry air would assume if it were brought adiabatically to a normal or standard pressure .",
    "this quantity has been called `` potential temperature '' by von bezold ( 1888 , 1891 ) and the link between @xmath1 and the specific dry air entropy has been discussed later , in bauer ( 1908 , 1910 ) .    since these pioneering studies",
    ", the concept of potential temperature has been generalized to moist air by using different approaches .",
    "the first method is to compute integrals of different approximate versions of the so - called gibbs ( 1875 - 76 - 77 - 78 ) differential equation . with the notations of the appendix - a ,",
    "it is written @xmath7 the following definitions ensue    * the liquid potential temperature @xmath5 of b73 , leading to a conservative moist variable , almost constant within the stratocumulus regions if the sum of water vapour plus liquid water is a constant ; * the saturated equivalent potential temperature @xmath8 obtained in b73 as a companion of @xmath5 ; * the ice - liquid water potential temperature @xmath9 , suggested in deardorff ( 1976 ) and derived in tripoli and cotton ( 1981 , hereafter tc81 ) , to be applied to the parameterization of the cumulus .",
    "another set of definitions concerns the impact of the buoyancy force , or other thermodynamic computations , leading to    * the equivalent potential temperature @xmath10 , obtained after the condensation level as the dry potential temperature that a parcel will have when all the water is removed from it , via pseudo - adiabatic processes ; * the virtual potential temperature @xmath11 of lilly ( 1968 , hereafter l68 ) , used for instance in the thermal production term involved in the turbulent kinetic energy turbulent equations , also in the computation of the cape for deep convection ; * the liquid water virtual potential temperature @xmath12 described in grenier and bretherton ( 2001 , hereafter gb01 ) , suitable for the parameterization of the stratocumulus top pbl entrainment .    the last method is to start with the analytic formulations for the moist specific entropy @xmath6 , expressed as a sum of the partial specific entropies for dry air and water species .",
    "the moist potential ( entropic ) temperature ( let us say @xmath0 ) is then determined without the use of a gibbs differential equation , by writing the moist entropy @xmath6 with some prescribed reference state defined by @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , leading to @xmath16 the following definitions ensue    * different entropy temperatures in hauf and hller ( 1987 , hereafter hh87 ) , including the one denoted by @xmath17 in what follows ( it was denoted by @xmath18 in hh87 ) ; * a moist potential temperature @xmath19 in marquet ( 1993 , hereafter m93 ) , used in the post - processing of the arpege - ifs models ( subroutines ppwetpoint and ppthpw ) and in the definition of the conservative fluxes and the barycentric equations derived in catry _",
    "( 2007 ) ; * the liquid water potential temperature of emanuel ( 1994 , hereafter e94 ) , denoted by @xmath20 in what follows , including some extra terms when compared to the betts formulation @xmath5 ( with @xmath20 denoted by @xmath5 in e94 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . the analytic expression for the moist entropy and for @xmath0",
    "will be obtained starting from the definition ( [ defthetam0 ] ) .",
    "the classical potential temperatures ( @xmath11 , @xmath8 , @xmath5 , @xmath9 and @xmath12 ) are first recalled in section [ section_mptvl ] .",
    "the seldom used moist entropy potential temperatures @xmath17 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are recalled in section [ section_mptthast ] .",
    "the new formulation @xmath0 is then derived analytically in section [ section_defthm ] and in the appendix - b and compared to the previous ones .",
    "a first - order approximation for @xmath0 is proposed in section [ section_aftha ] .",
    "the conservative property verified by @xmath0 is computed in section [ section_cpftha ] and compared to the one verified by @xmath17 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the moist entropy potential temperature @xmath0 is evaluated in section [ section_nefd ] by using the fire - i experiment , with the pbl aircraft dataset described in rw07 .",
    "the impacts of some of the approximations are analysed in section [ section_sens ] .",
    "the vertical fluxes of @xmath0 are computed in section [ section_flux_grad ] .",
    "palush conserved variables and skew @xmath2-@xmath3 diagrams are analysed in sections [ section_others_sc ] and [ section_diagram ] in terms of the new formulation @xmath0 .",
    "some justifications of the constant feature for @xmath0 are suggested in section [ section_constths ] , including some useful gibbs - like 3d visions .",
    "finally , conclusions are presented in section [ section_concl ] .",
    "the potential temperatures @xmath5 and @xmath8 are defined in b73 ( see eqs.(6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) to ( 12 ) in that paper ) by approximate gibbs differential equations and with @xmath21 assumed to be a constant .",
    "the formulation for @xmath5 and @xmath8 are obtained with several approximations , such as @xmath22 and @xmath23 , leading to @xmath24 the corresponding values for @xmath8 and @xmath5 are obtained by integrating ( [ defthesb73a ] ) and ( [ defthb73a ] ) with some further approximations ( see also betts and dugan , 1973 ) , particularly for the last term and the variations of @xmath25 with @xmath2 , giving @xmath26 eq.([defthb73b ] ) is the equivalent of eq.(13 ) in b73 , expressed with the notations of the appendix - a .",
    "the potential temperature ( [ defthb73b ] ) can be further modified by using the taylor s series approximation @xmath27 , leading to eq.(14 ) in b73 and corresponding to ( [ defthb73c ] ) @xmath28 this pair of betts moist variables @xmath29 are nowadays used to compute the moist turbulent fluxes in most of the turbulent schemes ( see for example brinkop and roeckner ( 1995 ) or cuxart _ et al . _",
    "( 2000 ) , hereafter br95 and cbr00 )    the variables @xmath29 are considered as conservative ones for the hydrostatic and adiabatic motion of a closed parcel of moist air , i.e. if @xmath30 and @xmath31 are constant in the clear - air and the in - cloud regions ( the precipitating species are not considered ) .",
    "accordingly , the equations for the water species correspond to an exchange between the vapour and the liquid phases via evaporation or condensation processes , leading to @xmath32 as already mentioned in deardorff ( 1980 ) the conservative property is verified for @xmath5 only if the change of @xmath25 is neglected in the logarithmic derivative of ( [ defthb73b ] ) , leading to @xmath33 the temperature equation must be simplified too , with @xmath34 replaced by @xmath35 ( as in b73 ) and with @xmath36 , leading to @xmath37 the expected conservative property @xmath38 is obtained with ( [ def_dl ] ) and ( [ def_dtapprox ] ) inserted into ( [ defthb73bapprox2 ] ) .    the even more simple deardorff s ( 1976 ) formula ( [ defthb73d ] ) is sometimes used for @xmath5 , as in rw07 .",
    "@xmath39 it is valid if the exner function @xmath40 is approximated by @xmath41 in the correction terms including @xmath42 ( true for instance within a thin marine pbl , where @xmath43 ) .",
    "the ice - liquid water potential temperature @xmath9 is defined by eqs.(26 ) and ( 28 ) in the paper tc81 , starting from an integral of the gibbs equation and with the same kind of approximations as in b73 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 considered as constant with @xmath2 and evaluated at @xmath46 . as suggested in the section 4 of deardorff ( 1976 ) , @xmath9 is a three phases generalization of @xmath5 that takes into account the impact of both @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in order to be applied to the parameterization of the liquid - ice cumulus and leading to @xmath49      the liquid - water virtual potential temperature @xmath12 is defined in gb01 ( section 3-b ; appendixes  a and b ) in terms of the two betts variables ( [ defthb73c ] ) and ( [ defqtb73 ] ) alone . @xmath50 it is used in the measure of the buoyancy jump @xmath51 , with the approximation @xmath52 made in gb01 at the top of the pbl of the stratocumulus . it is also used in the computation of the top pbl entrainment velocity ( see eqs.(16 ) , ( 18 ) and ( b7 ) in the paper gb01 ) .      the virtual potential temperature @xmath11 is defined in l68 by a differential equation ( see eq.(22 ) in that paper ) and it is not based on a gibbs equation .",
    "the aim was to seek for a moist conservative thermodynamic variable in an atmosphere subject to phase changes which would become a measure of buoyancy . with the notations of the appendix - a",
    ", it corresponds to ( [ defthl68a ] ) with the use of a mean reference value @xmath53 , leading to @xmath54 the virtual potential temperature @xmath11 is not explicitly computed in lilly ( 1968 ) .",
    "it appears in the form of the vertical flux of it , namely @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath53 is a constant term , ( [ defthl68a ] ) corresponds to @xmath56    the vertical flux of @xmath11 defined by ( [ defthl68a2 ] ) is often used as a measure of the buoyancy fluxes , for instance in the moist thermal production @xmath57 , one of the terms acting in the turbulent kinetic energy equations ( see br95 or cbr00 , among others ) .",
    "this buoyancy potential temperature is also used for the computations of the bougeault and lacarrre ( 1989 ) non - local mixing length ( see cbr00 ) .",
    "it is possible to define the lilly s virtual potential temperature @xmath11 by integrating ( [ defthl68a ] ) for @xmath53 considered as a constant term , then with @xmath53 replaced by @xmath1 , leading to @xmath58 it can be remarked that the actual temperature associated with @xmath11 corresponds to the `` density temperature '' denoted by @xmath59 in e94 .",
    "in the paper hh87 , the specific entropy @xmath6 is defined by eqs.(3.23 ) and ( 3.25 ) in terms of an entropy temperature denoted by @xmath17 hereafter .",
    "it can be rewritten , with some algebra and with the notation of the appendix - a , to give @xmath60 where @xmath61 as noted in hh87 , this formulation for @xmath17 supposes the existence of liquid water , at least implicitly , from the use of @xmath62 in ( [ defthshh87 ] ) and @xmath63 in the definition of @xmath64 .",
    "this can be a drawback , since it may not be true for the most general case of an arbitrary parcel or moist air , either saturated or under - saturated , with possibly only liquid water or only solid water .",
    "as for the contribution due to @xmath47 into the exponential of ( [ defthast1hh87 ] ) , it is a positive term contrary to what happens in @xmath5 or @xmath9 .",
    "similarly to the method used in hh87 , another moist entropy potential temperature is obtained in m93 as a by - product of the formulation for the moist exergy of an open atmospheric parcel .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath19 and , as in hh87 , it is directly derived in its analytic form starting from the general formulation for @xmath6 , the specific moist entropy of the system , written in m93 as @xmath65 it is suggested in m93 to define the moist entropy potential temperatures @xmath19 and @xmath66 as @xmath67 the interest of writing @xmath6 in m93 by ( [ defths ] ) as a complement to @xmath68 was to avoid the problem encountered in hh87 , where the definition of @xmath17 by ( [ defthshh87 ] ) supposes the existence of liquid water or ice , with the use of the dry - air ( @xmath69 ) and the liquid ( @xmath62 ) standard values . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath19 defined by ( [ defths ] ) is valid for both under - saturated conditions ( @xmath70 ) or saturated conditions ( @xmath71 or @xmath72 ) , with only the dry - air and water - vapour reference values @xmath73 and @xmath74 involved , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 always exist in the atmosphere .",
    "the exponential term in ( [ defthast1 ] ) is almost the same as the one of b73 , at least for the common liquid water part .",
    "the difference with ( [ defthb73b ] ) is the term @xmath77 , approximated by @xmath78 in b73 .",
    "it is also similar to the exponential term of tc81 recalled in ( [ defthtc81a ] ) , for both the liquid and the solid water parts .",
    "the term @xmath77 is approximated by @xmath78 and with @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "even if the purpose of hh97 was to show that modified versions of the gibbs equation verified by @xmath17 could lead to most of the potential temperature introduced in section [ section_mptvl ] , the entropy temperatures @xmath17 and @xmath19 given by ( [ defthast1hh87 ] ) and ( [ defthast1 ] ) are not directly expressed with the usual notations , as is done for @xmath11 , @xmath5 , @xmath9 or @xmath12 .",
    "it could be one of the reasons that have prevented @xmath17 or @xmath19 to be applied in most of subsequent meteorological studies .    in order to overcome this drawback ,",
    "one of the purposes of the present paper is to rewrite @xmath19 in a more conventional way .",

    "nevertheless the bracketed term is different from @xmath41 and it can impact on @xmath19 not only in cloudy regions but also for the moist clear - air case , with @xmath19 different from the dry - air version @xmath98 .",
    "the liquid - water virtual potential temperature is defined in e94 starting from some approximated analytic definition of the entropy of moist air , considered as the sum of dry air , water vapour and liquid water components , with no ice content ( @xmath100 and @xmath31 ) .",

    "nonetheless , with the use of the notation of the appendix - a , when ( [ def_sd_e94 ] ) to ( [ def_sl_e94 ] ) are inserted into ( [ def_s_e94c ] ) , @xmath20 is defined in e94 ( see eq.(4.5.15 ) , page 121 ) by @xmath110 where @xmath111 \\;\\ ;       \\left [        \\frac { { (   \\eta\\:r_t)}^{{(r_t r_v)}/{{c}^{\\ast}_p } } }             { { ( 1+\\eta\\:r_t)}^{r^{\\ast}/{{c}^{\\ast}_p } } }       \\right ] \\ ;          \\exp \\left ( - \\ :                       \\frac{l_v\\:r_l}{{c}^{\\ast}_p\\:t }                  \\right )    \\ : . \\label{defthl_e94}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be remarked that @xmath112 is denoted by @xmath113 in e94 , with @xmath114 in @xmath115 and @xmath77 , also with @xmath116 .",
    "the definition ( [ defe94s ] ) is different from ( [ defthetam0 ] ) , with no reference term included for the entropy or the potential temperature .",
