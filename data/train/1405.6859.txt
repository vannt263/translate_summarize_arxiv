    "quantum correlations in composite systems transcend entanglement @xcite .",
    "a bipartite quantum state @xmath0 can be defined as nonclassical or nonclassically correlated if it can not be expressed as a convex mixture of local basis states of subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "consequently , all inseparable ( entangled ) states as well as the majority of separable states are nonclassical .",
    "general nonclassical correlations , however , can be mapped to entanglement in a very precise sense , which provides an insightful framework for their characterization and operational interpretation .",
    "specifically , it was proven in @xcite and very recently experimentally observed in @xcite that all nonclassical states of a finite - dimensional system can be turned into states with distillable entanglement between the system and a set of ancillae by an _",
    "activation protocol_. focusing on a bipartite setting , the protocol runs as follows .",
    "the subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 are first subject to arbitrary local unitary transformations @xmath3 ; then , each system @xmath4 interacts via a controlled - not ( cnot ) operation @xmath5 ( i.e.  a so - called premeasurement interaction ) with an auxiliary system @xmath6 , @xmath4 , initialized in a pure state @xmath7.the activation protocol then possesses two key properties : i ) for all classical states @xmath0 at the input of the protocol , there exist local unitaries @xmath3 for which the output state @xmath8 is separable across the @xmath9 splitting , and ii ) for all nonclassical states @xmath0 and for all local unitaries , the output state is entangled across the @xmath9 splitting .    let us stress that both criteria i ) and ii ) must be met by any scheme in order to be a valid activation protocol .",
    "in particular , they allow us to define faithful measures of nonclassical correlations for the input state @xmath0 in terms of the output @xmath9 entanglement , minimized over @xmath3 .",
    "one such measure , when the output entanglement is quantified by the negativity @xcite , has been termed negativity of quantumness @xcite , and has been experimentally investigated in @xcite    in this paper we study activation of nonclassical correlations in multimode bipartite gaussian states @xmath0 of continuous variable systems @xcite .",
    "nonclassical correlations of gaussian states have been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally @xcite but their interplay with entanglement has not been pinned down so far in terms of the activation framework .",
    "attempts to devise activation - like protocols for gaussian states have been explored @xcite . however , these differed significantly from the original prescription in that nonunitary operations were employed between system and ancillae , so that the entanglement generation was obtained as a dynamical feature , and conditions i ) and ii ) were not generally verified .    here",
    "we consider a general gaussian activation protocol in which @xmath3 are gaussian unitaries and the cnot gates are replaced with a global gaussian unitary on subsystems @xmath10 . in section  [ sec_1 ]",
    "we then prove that any such protocol satisfying condition i ) will unavoidably violate condition ii ) , which implies that activation of gaussian nonclassical correlations by gaussian operations is impossible .",
    "this fact establishes a new no - go theorem for gaussian quantum information processing , which can be enlisted alongside other well known no - go results such as the the no - distillation theorem , according to which distilling entanglement from gaussian states by using only gaussian operations is impossible @xcite .",
    "we then show in section  [ sec_2 ] how , by using non - gaussian operations which properly extend the cnot to infinite dimensions , one can construct the continuous variable counterpart of the activation protocol of @xcite , verifying criteria i ) and ii ) .",
    "this allows us to define the negativity of quantumness for gaussian states and to calculate it for relevant examples in section  [ sec_3 ] .",
    "this work provides an operational setting to understand and manipulate nonclassical correlations in paradigmatic infinite - dimensional systems .",
    "we draw our conclusions in section  [ sec_4 ] , while some technical derivations ( which can be of independent interest ) are deferred to the appendices .",
    "gaussian states are quantum states of systems with an infinite - dimensional hilbert space ( continuous variable systems ) , e.g.  a collection of harmonic oscillators , which possess a gaussian - shaped wigner function in phase space @xcite . @xmath11 modes are described by a vector @xmath12 of quadrature operators @xmath13 satisfying the canonical commutation rules expressible in terms of elements of the vector @xmath14 as @xmath15=i\\omega_{jk}$ ] , @xmath16 with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the pauli @xmath19-matrix .",
    "an @xmath11-mode gaussian state @xmath20 is fully characterized by a @xmath21 vector @xmath22 of the first moments with elements @xmath23 and by its @xmath24 covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath25 with elements @xmath26 , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "gaussian unitaries are generated by hamiltonians that are quadratic in the quadrature operators and they preserve the gaussian characteristic of quantum states .",
    "an @xmath11-mode gaussian unitary @xmath29 is represented in phase space by a @xmath24 real symplectic transformation @xmath30 satisfying the condition @xmath31 , which transforms a cm @xmath25 to @xmath32 .",
    "here we are interested in the question of whether an activation protocol exists satisfying conditions i ) and ii ) which would rely solely on gaussian states and gaussian unitaries .",
    "we therefore assume the state @xmath0 to be a gaussian state of @xmath33 modes with cm @xmath34 and the state @xmath35 of the ancilla to be also a gaussian state with cm @xmath36 .",
    "the local unitaries @xmath3 of the original discrete protocol are replaced with local gaussian unitaries @xmath37 and @xmath38 represented by the symplectic matrices @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "likewise , the global operation @xmath41 on the whole system @xmath42 is replaced with one global gaussian unitary @xmath29 represented by a symplectic matrix @xmath30 .",
    "let us recall the definition of a fully classical state @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is a bipartite state containing two subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 with @xmath43 and @xmath44 modes respectively , and let @xmath45 be a basis of subsystem @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "if there exists a basis @xmath50 consisting of the tensor products of all elements of @xmath51 with all elements of @xmath52 , then @xmath0 is a classical state if it is diagonal with respect to @xmath50 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that a two - mode gaussian state is classical if and only if it is a product state , i.e. , its cm is represented by a direct sum @xmath53 of local cms @xmath54 .",
    "one can prove that this statement remains valid for the generic case of bipartite @xmath33-mode gaussian states ( see appendix  [ secapp_1 ] for the proof ) .",
    "therefore , all non - product bipartite gaussian states ( including separable ones ) are nonclassical . according to condition",
    "i ) in any gaussian activation protocol with an input gaussian product state there must exist local gaussian unitaries @xmath3 for which one gets a separable state @xmath8 across the @xmath9 splitting at the output of the protocol .",
    "we will show however , that this implies that for _ all _ separable gaussian states including nonclassical ones , there exist local gaussian unitaries @xmath3 for which the output state is separable .",
    "that is , condition ii ) is not satisfied .",

    "as the unitaries @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath29 induce a linear transformation of quadrature operators of the input modes , the displacements @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be relocated behind the global transformation @xmath29 ( dotted arrow ) .",

( [ displacement ] ) , can not turn a separable state into an entangled state and therefore the protocol transforms the separable state @xmath0 into a state which is separable across the @xmath9 cut ( thick dashed line ) . see text for details.,width=321 ]    the proof of this no - go theorem is depicted in fig .",
    "it follows from the decomposability of any gaussian separable state into a product state and noise @xcite , and the linearity of symplectic transformations .",
    "namely , for any separable gaussian state with cm @xmath34 there exist local cms @xmath54 such that @xmath61 in other words , any separable gaussian state with cm @xmath34 can be prepared from a suitable product state with cm @xmath53 by the addition of noise , represented by a positive - semidefinite matrix @xmath58 , i.e. , @xmath62 .",
    "the noise can be created by displacing the vector of quadratures @xmath63 of the product state as @xmath64 . here",

    "let us now consider a separable state with cm @xmath34 at the input of a gaussian activation protocol and let @xmath75 be a cm of the product state from which the state can be prepared using the aforementioned algorithm .",
    "assume that the local symplectic matrices @xmath76 are chosen such that the cm @xmath77 of the output state , where @xmath36 is the cm of the state of the ancilla , is separable across the @xmath9 splitting .",
    "hence , for the original separable state with cm @xmath34 , the output of the activation protocol is obtained by displacing the vector of quadratures @xmath78 for the state with cm @xmath79 by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a @xmath82 zero vector with @xmath83 being the number of modes of the ancilla @xmath84 . however , for a separable state with cm @xmath79 , where @xmath85 is separable from @xmath84 , the local displacements ( [ displacement ] ) can not create a state in which the system @xmath85 is entangled with the system @xmath84 .",
    "consequently , for any separable state ( even nonclassical ) it is always possible to find local gaussian unitaries for which the output is separable , thus accomplishing the proof of the no - go theorem .",
    "therefore , gaussian operations are unable to activate nonclassical correlations of gaussian separable states into entanglement in the worst - case scenario : assuming condition i ) holds , then for any gaussian separable state there exist local gaussian unitaries for which the output of the activation protocol remains a separable gaussian state .",
    "this indicates that a non - gaussian element , like a non - gaussian global unitary @xmath86 or a non - gaussian state of the ancilla , is necessary for faithful activation of nonclassical correlations in gaussian states . in the following we design such an activation protocol involving a non - gaussian cnot gate in the fock basis and an ancillary system in a gaussian state",
    "the main benefit of the activation protocol is that it allows one to quantify the amount of nonclassical correlations in a given quantum state as the potential to create entanglement in the activation protocol @xcite .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath87 denotes an entanglement measure quantifying the amount of entanglement between systems @xmath85 and @xmath84 in a quantum state @xmath8 , then we can define a measure of nonclassical correlations on the input state @xmath0 as @xmath88 where the minimization is carried out over all local unitaries @xmath89 and @xmath90 on subsystems @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",

    "the higher - order hermite polynomials can be calculated from the lower - order ones by using e.g.  the recurrence formula derived in appendix  [ secapp_2 ] .",
    "we remark that the compact expression in equation ( [ rhohermite ] ) is of independent interest and can be useful for the characterization of hybrid information processing involving conversion between continuous and discrete variable entanglement @xcite , or particularly for studies of bell nonlocality of arbitrary two - mode gaussian states by means of dichotomic pseudospin measurements @xcite , whose expectation value can be conveniently evaluated at the fock space level .    in the context of the present paper , apart from the utility for numerical evaluation of the output negativity ( [ n2 ] ) , equation ( [ rhohermite ] ) also enables us to derive a simple analytical lower bound on the output negativity .",
    "the bound results from the following chain of inequalities @xmath160 where the first inequality follows from the inequality @xmath161 which holds for any @xmath162 , the second inequality is a consequence of the triangular inequality for absolute values , and the last equation follows from the expression for the generating function of the four - dimensional hermite polynomials at the origin @xcite , @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 is the matrix ( [ rr ] ) . a comparison between the right - hand side ( rhs ) of the previous equation and the expression of the husimi @xmath166-quasiprobability distribution @xmath167 in the fock basis further yields @xmath168 as can be easily seen from the results of appendix  [ secapp_2 ] .",
