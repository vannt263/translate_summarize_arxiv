    "there is a long history of attempts to unite relativistic mean - field phenomenology with manifest chiral symmetry . in particular , it has been tempting to build upon the linear sigma model @xcite , where a light scalar meson plays a dual role as the chiral partner of the pion _ and _ the mediator of the intermediate - range nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( nn ) attraction . in earlier work @xcite , we surveyed a broad class of these chiral hadronic models and observed that they fail to reproduce basic properties of finite nuclei at the hartree level . in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate the generic failure of this type of model using a more complete approach @xcite for analyzing the relationship between model parameters and nuclear observables .",
    "we also illustrate the characteristics of chiral models that _ can _ successfully describe finite nuclei .",
    "we base our analysis on an energy functional , which depends on valence - nucleon dirac wave functions and classical scalar and vector meson fields . extremizing the functional leads to coupled equations for finite nuclei and nuclear matter",
    "[ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : efunctional])([eq : diraceq ] ) ] .",
    "the successes of relativistic mean - field models have shown that these variables ( nucleon , scalar , vector ) allow an efficient and natural description of bulk and single - particle nuclear properties .",
    "although the energy functional contains classical meson fields , this framework can accommodate physics beyond the simple hartree ( or one - baryon - loop ) approximation .",
    "this is achieved by combining aspects of both density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite and effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite . in a dft formulation of the relativistic nuclear many - body problem ,",
    "the central object is an energy functional of scalar and vector densities ( or more generally , vector four - currents ) .",
    "extremization of the functional gives rise to dirac equations for occupied orbitals with",
    "_ local _ scalar and vector potentials , not only in the hartree approximation , but in the general case as well . rather than work solely with the densities",
    ", we can introduce auxiliary variables corresponding to the local potentials , so that the functional depends also on meson fields .",
    "the resulting dft formulation takes the form of a hartree calculation , but correlation effects can be included , _ if _ the proper density functional can be found .",
    "our procedure is analogous to the well - known kohn",
    " sham @xcite approach in dft , with the local meson fields playing the role of kohn ",
    "sham potentials ; by introducing nonlinear couplings between these fields , we can implicitly include density dependence in the single - particle potentials .",
    "moreover , by introducing the meson fields , we can incorporate the ideas of eft .",
    "the exact energy functional has kinetic energy and hartree parts ( which are combined in the relativistic formulation ) plus an `` exchange - correlation '' functional , which is a nonlocal , nonanalytic functional of the densities that contains all the other many - body and relativistic effects .",
    "we do not try to construct the latter functional explicitly from a lagrangian ( which would be equivalent to solving the full many - body problem ) , nor do we attempt here to construct an explicit functional using standard many - body techniques @xcite .",
    "rather , we approximate the functional using an expansion in classical meson fields and their derivatives .",
    "the parameters introduced in the expansion can be fit to experiment , and if we have a systematic way to truncate the expansion , the framework is predictive .",
    "thus a conventional mean - field energy functional fit directly to nuclear properties , if allowed to be sufficiently general , will automatically incorporate effects beyond the hartree approximation , such as those due to short - range correlations .",
    "we rely on the special characteristics of nuclear ground states in a relativistic formulation , namely , that the mean scalar and vector potentials @xmath0 and @xmath1 are large on nuclear energy scales but are small compared to the nucleon mass @xmath2 and vary slowly in finite nuclei@xcite .",
    "this implies that the ratios @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the gradients @xmath5 and @xmath6 are useful expansion parameters . moreover , as is illustrated in dirac ",
    "brueckner  hartree",
    " fock ( dbhf ) calculations @xcite , the scalar and vector potentials ( or self - energies ) are nearly state independent and are dominated by the hartree contributions .",
    "thus the hartree contributions to the energy functional should dominate , and an expansion of the exchange - correlation functional in terms of mean fields should be a reasonable approximation .",
    "this `` hartree dominance '' also implies that it should be a good approximation to associate the single - particle dirac eigenvalues with the observed nuclear energy levels , at least for states near the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "of course , the mean - field expansion can not accommodate all of the nonlocal and nonanalytic aspects of the exchange - correlation functional ; however , we reserve a complete discussion of the limits of this approach for future work @xcite .    the mean - field energy functional",
    "is specified by the values of various coupling constants and masses .",
    "these parameters can be constrained in two ways .",
    "first , the energy functional provides a framework for relating model parameters to appropriate nuclear observables .",
    "this translates empirical nuclear properties into conditions on acceptable parametrizations . in practice , nuclei provide rather stringent constraints . on the other hand",
    ", the realization of qcd symmetries ( such as chiral symmetry ) in a candidate model lagrangian may impose relationships between parameters in the corresponding hartree approximation to the energy functional .",
    "our goal in this work is to test whether the two sets of constraints are compatible .",
    "we begin by analyzing a general energy functional to determine the characteristics that generate successful phenomenology .",
    "an essential element is a plausible truncation scheme , so that the functional does not entail an unrestricted number of parameters .",
    "as indicated earlier , our basic expansion parameters are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 correspond to the potentials in the single - particle dirac equations [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : diraceq ] ) ] .",
    "we define success through a set of nuclear observables that should be quantitatively reproduced in any useful description of ground - state properties .",
    "these observables include : 1 ) nuclear shape properties , such as charge radii and charge densities , 2 ) nuclear binding - energy systematics , and 3 ) single - particle properties such as level spacings and orderings , which reflect spin - orbit splittings and shell structure .",
    "if one recalls that the kohn ",
    "sham approach is formulated to reproduce precisely the ground - state density , and that the hartree contributions are expected to dominate the dirac single - particle potentials , _ these observables are precisely the ones for which meaningful comparisons with experiment should be possible .",
    "_ moreover , experience has shown that these observables can be replaced by a set of nuclear matter properties plus constraints on the meson masses @xcite .",
    "while the parameters of a general functional are not completely determined by requiring these properties to be reproduced , regions in parameter space that generate realistic nuclei can clearly be identified .",
    "the second part of our analysis is to examine specific chiral models that adopt a particular realization of chiral symmetry at the lagrangian level _ and _ a particular mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "these two features restrict the accessible regions of parameter space , and we can simply compare with the regions determined in the first part of our analysis to see if there is an overlap .",
    "we stress that in this part of the analysis , we actually start with an explicit lagrangian and construct the energy functional by working strictly in the hartree approximation ; thus , the effects of correlations in these chiral models , for example , are beyond our analysis .",
    "nevertheless , the hartree energy functionals are simply special cases of the general functional considered above , so we can apply our earlier results .",
    "the most important ingredient is a procedure that can systematically connect the nuclear observables and the model parameters . in previous analyses , the mean - field parameters",
    "have been determined either by fitting nuclear matter equilibrium properties plus some input from finite nuclei ( _ e.g. _ , the rms radius of @xmath7ca ) or by optimizing the predictions of selected experimental observables across the periodic table ( using a @xmath8 measure , for example ) .",
    "these procedures are useful if the goal is to find a good description of nuclei for a given model , but not if we want to rule out a class of models . in particular , it is difficult to search through the parameter space to determine where the boundaries of acceptable parametrizations lie",
    ". this severely limits qualitative insight and solid conclusions .",
    "the first approach was followed in our previous studies of linear sigma models : we explored the chiral - model parameter space by fitting to nuclear matter equilibrium properties and then by calculating finite nuclei for what we hoped was an exhaustive range of parameter sets .",
    "in the present work , we invert this analysis by adapting the approach developed by bodmer @xcite , which enables us to use basic nuclear properties , derived from the observables , _ to solve directly for the model parameters_. since there are only a few basic properties that provide meaningful constraints , the resulting conditions are undercomplete for the most general functionals , and there are families of acceptable solutions defined by regions in the parameter space .",
    "specific models , however , introduce relations among some parameters and set others to zero , so that in the accessible region of parameter space there may be no acceptable descriptions of nuclei .",
    "thus one way a model can fail is if there is no overlap between the accessible and desirable regions of parameter space .",
    "there is another way a model can fail , which arises from the nonlinear meson interactions in the energy functional and in the resulting meson field equations . for some models and some parameter sets",
    ", one can find a nuclear ground state that has the appropriate properties at equilibrium , but this ground state exists only over a narrow range of nuclear densities . if the ground state fails to exist at densities that have clearly been obtained experimentally ( say , slightly higher than normal nuclear matter density ) , the disappearance of the model ground state must also be considered a failure of the model . we will make these considerations more precise as we proceed .",
    "the results of the present analysis solidify our previous conclusion @xcite that chiral hadronic models built upon the conventional linear sigma model can not reproduce observed properties of finite nuclei in the hartree approximation .",
    "the main problems in these linear sigma models arise from the nonlinear terms in the `` mexican - hat '' potential , which serves to precipitate spontaneous symmetry breaking , and from the large pion coupling .",
    "the consequences are a scalar meson mass that is too large and density - dependent forces ( in the form of scalar self - couplings ) with the wrong systematics .",
    "these problems are not remedied by including one - baryon - loop vacuum corrections or by adding parameters that generalize the model .    on the other hand , chiral models",
    "that _ are _ phenomenologically successful can be constructed . as an example , we discuss a model that was introduced in a recent paper @xcite , which features a nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry .    for a model to be viable , it should also exhibit `` naturalness '' in the fitted parameters . here , naturalness implies that the coefficients of the various terms in the energy functional , when expressed in appropriate dimensionless form , should all be of order unity .",
    "this means that we can anticipate the approximate magnitude of contributions to the energy functional ( at least up to moderate nuclear densities ) and thereby motivate a suitable expansion and truncation scheme for the functional ; if the coefficients are natural , the omitted terms will be numerically unimportant .",
    "the naturalness of our effective field theory also implies that one should include all possible terms ( that is , those allowed by the symmetries ) through a given order of truncation ; it is _ unnatural _ for some coefficients to vanish without an appropriate symmetry argument .",
    "one consequence is that nonlinear interactions of the vector field should play an important role in providing a good and natural fit to nuclei , and we indeed find that this is the case .",
    "we stress this point because nearly all investigations of relativistic mean - field phenomenology to date have arbitrarily restricted consideration to scalar self - interactions only .",
    "the quartic vector self - coupling has been included in phenomenological calculations only recently @xcite .",
    "there are many studies in the literature that have characterized the nature of phenomenologically successful mean - field models , including refs .  .",
    "we echo many of the common conclusions , such as the necessity for a small nucleon effective mass ( @xmath9 ) at equilibrium density and for a scalar meson mass of roughly @xmath10",
    ". nevertheless , since previous analyses typically determined the model parameters through a fitting procedure that simply calculates nuclei repeatedly until a `` good fit '' is obtained , connections between nuclear observables and the resulting parameters are somewhat obscure . through our analysis",
    ", we try to demystify the connections between the observables and the parameters , so that the structure of the resulting energy functionals can be better understood .    the original motivation for this work was to expand upon our previous analyses of linear chiral models @xcite and",
    "thereby solidify our earlier conclusions .",
    "in carrying out this program , however , we were forced to extend our mean - field machinery in several different directions .",
    "it is important to emphasize these new aspects , which are more general than the chiral - model analysis , and which in fact comprise the most important results in this paper .",
    "first , by starting from an energy functional containing baryons and classical scalar and vector fields , we have a framework that goes beyond the simple hartree approximation .",
    "this follows because we can interpret the analysis in the context of density functional theory and an associated ( relativistic ) kohn  sham approach .",
    "second , although it is possible to vary the parameters in the energy functional until desirable properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei are obtained , it is more efficient to invert the field equations and express the model parameters directly in terms of the desired observables .",
    "this allows for a systematic investigation of the parameter space and clarifies the relationships between observables and model parameters .",
    "finally , by applying ideas from effective field theory , such as the importance of naturalness and a suitable expansion scheme , to the construction of the ground - state energy functional , we find that it is important and necessary to include all allowable terms in the functional at the chosen level of truncation .",
    "this modern view of relativistic quantum field theory @xcite generalizes earlier approaches based on renormalizable theories @xcite and allows for a more unified discussion of relativistic approaches to the nuclear many - body problem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : setup ] , we consider a general energy functional ( not manifestly chiral ) and characterize phenomenologically successful models . in section  [ sec : bodmer ] , we show how empirical properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei can be used directly to determine or to constrain the parametrizations of candidate energy functionals .",
    "we also illustrate how to map out the parameter space . in section  [ sec : sigma ] , we specialize the analysis to models built on the linear sigma model with a `` mexican - hat '' potential and demonstrate their generic failure at the hartree level . in section  [ sec : tang ] , we consider a chiral model that successfully describes finite nuclei .",
    "section  [ sec : discuss ] has some additional discussion , including the general strategy that justifies the expansion and truncation scheme .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is a summary .",
    "our first goal is to construct an energy functional whose extremization accurately reproduces bulk and single - particle nuclear observables . experience with relativistic mean - field models shows that scalar and vector mesons with appropriate masses lead to nn interactions with the desired ranges , and that by introducing nonlinearities in the meson fields , we can include density dependence in these interactions @xcite .",
    "we assume that the nuclear ground states have good parity and are invariant under time reversal , which implies that a classical pion field does not appear nuclei are studied using mean - field models , time - reversal invariance is broken explicitly , which leads to pion mean fields . ]",
    "furthermore , we retain only the valence nucleons explicitly .",
    "this does not mean that we are _ neglecting _ pionic or vacuum effects , but rather that they are implicitly contained in the coefficients of the energy functional .",
    "this is discussed for one - loop vacuum contributions in ref .",
    "@xcite and in sec .",
    "[ sec : tang ] ; a more general discussion will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "as emphasized in the introduction , while our energy functional can be interpreted as arising from a hadronic lagrangian treated in the hartree approximation , it can also be interpreted as an approximation to a general density functional that incorporates all correlation effects .",
    "this approach is particularly compelling because of the dominance of hartree effects in the relativistic approach .",
    "this claim is supported by dirac ",
    "brueckner  hartree",

    "in contrast , in models with meson fields , the parameters are correlated , and these constraints are effective in restricting the relevant region of parameter space .",
    "if one accepts the validity of our assumption of naturalness , we can compare our truncated energy functional to one obtained directly from the hartree ( or one - baryon - loop ) approximation to a given lagrangian .",
    "although both approaches lead to dirac equations for nucleons moving in local meson fields , the parameters in the energy functional and in the lagrangian may actually be related in a complicated fashion .",
    "the basic premise of density functional theory is that it is possible to parametrize exchange and two - nucleon correlation effects through local ( kohn  sham ) potentials ( or self - energies ) , and that is how we may interpret our local meson fields .",
    "this approach is useful , however , only for ground - state properties like the total energy and particle densities , and in general , the single - particle wave functions and eigenvalues are simply mathematical constructs that have no direct relation to observables .",
    "fortunately , relativistic calculations including exchange and two - nucleon correlations show that the hartree contributions dominate the self - energies , which are essentially state independent .",
    "thus we expect that the large scalar and vector fields seen at the hartree level will control the dynamics , and that the majority of exchange and correlation effects can be included by adjusting the nonlinear parameters ( and thereby the density dependence ) contained in the energy functional ; this `` hartree dominance '' also makes it reasonable to compare the single - particle energies with observed spectra , at least for states near the fermi surface .",
    "these considerations again indicate the efficiency of writing the energy functional in terms of self - interacting meson fields : at normal nuclear densities these fields are small enough compared to the nucleon mass to provide useful expansion parameters , yet large enough that exchange and correlation corrections can be included , at least approximately , as minor perturbations .",
    "although this mean - field approach allows for an accurate description of many nuclear properties and has been applied to various regions of the periodic table , it is really just the first step in the development of a systematic treatment of the relativistic nuclear many - body problem based on effective field theory .",
    "there are many limitations and unsolved problems .",
    "first , there is the question of a more complete inclusion of higher - order corrections in the energy functional .",
    "these could be computed by starting with a lagrangian whose parameters are fit to nn data and then by calculating at a similar level ( for example , dbhf ) at finite density .",
    "although it is known that one can parametrize the density dependence of the dbhf self - energies with meson self - interactions @xcite , and that one can include rearrangement effects consistently in the single - particle dirac equations @xcite , the state dependence of the self - energies is neglected in these calculations . by comparing results of more sophisticated nuclear matter calculations with their mean - field parametrizations ,",
    "one may be able to optimize the description of state - dependent effects , which will be important if one wants to study the nucleon  nucleus optical potential at high energy , for example .",
    "the description of the quantum vacuum should also be improved . as discussed earlier ,",
    "it is possible to include these effects at the one - loop level by incorporating them into the model parameters ; if our naturalness assumption is valid , only a few such parameters are needed in practice .",
    "higher - order contributions , however , will require counterterms involving fermion fields and will introduce vacuum contributions that explicitly involve the valence nucleons ( the strong lamb shift , for example )",
    ". moreover , the present approach neglects contributions from meson loops .",
    "one must also consider the limitations of the present model , particularly with regard to extrapolation to high density . at nuclear densities and below",
    ", we have seen that only a few terms are needed in the energy functional to describe nuclei , and that the sensitivity to higher - order products of fields is minimal .",
    "this precludes a determination of the coefficients of these higher - order terms from empirical data . as the density increases",
    ", however , @xmath3 and @xmath4 increase accordingly , and the unknown higher - order terms may become important .",
    "this prevents a controlled extrapolation to high densities , such as those relevant in the interiors of neutron stars .",
    "it is not clear at present what the limits to reliable extrapolation are .",
    "these difficulties are shared by all existing treatments of the nuclear many - body problem in terms of hadrons ; for example , calculations of few - nucleon systems based on nonrelativistic potentials @xcite are sensitive to three - body ( and perhaps four - body ) forces , but reliable extrapolation to high density is likely to require information on additional many - body forces as well .    to close the discussion ,",
    "we return to the question of whether the nuclear properties considered here lead to additional constraints on the nuclear matter saturation curve near equilibrium . as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] , some recent work indicates that the ratio of the `` skewness '' @xmath47 to the compression modulus @xmath48 is constrained by monopole vibrations @xcite . to study this issue",
    ", we considered an energy functional of the form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efunctional ] ) with @xmath49 and varied the ratio @xmath50 by varying @xmath51 while holding all other nuclear matter inputs fixed .",
    "we found little correlation between the value of @xmath50 and the nuclear observables studied here ; for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : skewness ] , we show the proton levels near the fermi surface in @xmath52pb from five models for which @xmath50 ranges by more than a factor of five . as long as the parameter set is natural , the effects of varying the skewness are small , and similar results were found for other observables .",
    "these results support bodmer s conjecture @xcite that the spin - orbit splittings in nuclei are determined essentially by @xmath53 and are independent of the specific form of the nonlinear interactions .",
    "in this paper , we demonstrate that it is impossible to unite relativistic mean - field phenomenology with manifest chiral symmetry by building upon the conventional linear sigma model , which contains a `` mexican - hat '' potential and a light scalar meson playing a dual role as the chiral partner of the pion _ and _ the mediator of the intermediate - range nn attraction .",
    "we illustrate the generic failure of this type of model at the hartree level as well as the characteristics of chiral models that _ can _ successfully describe finite nuclei .",
    "although our study of chiral models involves specific lagrangians treated at the hartree ( or one - baryon - loop ) level , the analysis is based on the more general concept of an energy functional that describes the finite , many - nucleon system .",
    "the energy functional depends on valence - nucleon dirac wave functions and classical scalar and vector meson fields .",
    "we interpret this energy functional within the framework of density functional theory , which says that the exact energy functional for the system can be written entirely in terms of the scalar density and baryon four - current density . rather than work solely in terms of densities ,",
    "we include auxiliary meson fields , which correspond to ( local ) kohn  sham potentials , and which provide an efficient parametrization of the density dependence .",
    "thus , with a sufficiently general energy functional , we can include many - body effects beyond the simple hartree level , even though we retain only classical meson fields and local interactions . rather than attempt to compute the form of the functional directly from an underlying lagrangian",
    ", we use observed nuclear properties ( and extrapolations to nuclear matter ) to determine the unknown coefficients .    in the general case ,",
    "the energy functional contains an infinite number of interaction terms involving the nucleon and meson fields , and their derivatives .",
    "this is actually an advantage , since transformations of the field variables allow one to cast the functional in different forms , with the goal being to find the representation that allows the most efficient truncation . for the truncation to be plausible",
    ", one must have a reasonable ( small ) expansion parameter , and one must assume a principle of `` naturalness '' , which says that the coefficients of the expansion , when written in appropriate dimensionless ratios , must all be of order unity .",
    "these are precisely the basic ideas underlying applications of effective field theories , such as chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we showed that such a truncation of the energy functional is possible at and below normal nuclear densities , if the functional is written in terms of self - interacting scalar and vector fields with yukawa couplings to the nucleons ; under these conditions , the ratios of the meson fields ( and their gradients ) to the nucleon mass are small enough to serve as useful expansion parameters , and sets of coefficients can be found that both reproduce observed nuclear properties and satisfy the naturalness assumption . in practice , truncation of the energy functional at quartic terms in the meson fields and at quadratic terms in field gradients is sufficient for the observables studied here .",
    "to constrain the energy functional , we use nuclear observables that are meaningful from the standpoint of the underlying density functional framework , such as ( charge ) densities and total binding energies .",
    "although in general , the single - particle dirac eigenvalues obtained in the local potentials are not directly related to observables , we note that in the relativistic nuclear many - body problem , the single - particle potentials ( or self - energies ) are known to be dominated by the hartree contributions and are essentially state independent .",
    "thus the exchange and correlation effects included in the potentials are small , and it is reasonable to also use observed nuclear spectra as input , at least for states near the fermi surface . in short ,",
    "the observables we use to constrain the parameters are precisely the ones that should be calculable in a density functional framework where the hartree terms dominate the self - energies .",
    "we also observe the fortunate result that the scalar and vector fields are small enough compared to the nucleon mass to serve as useful expansion parameters , yet large enough that exchange and correlation effects enter only as small perturbations ( at least for occupied states ) .    rather than fit directly to the properties of finite nuclei ,",
    "we extrapolate instead and determine our parameters from the properties of nuclear matter near equilibrium . in nuclear matter , the energy functional reduces to a function of the fermi momentum and the ( constant ) scalar and vector fields ; it is then possible to invert the field equations and express the unknown parameters directly in terms of the nuclear matter `` observables '' .",
    "this allows us to scan the parameter space to find sets that lead to an accurate reproduction of nuclear properties .",
    "more importantly , we can exclude models that are too constrained ( by symmetry , for example ) by showing that it is impossible for them to reproduce desirable nuclear matter results .",
    "parameter sets that accurately reproduce nuclear observables typically involve small but significant nonlinear meson self - interactions .",
    "these self - interactions introduce additional density dependence beyond that contained in simple yukawa meson  nucleon couplings .",
    "this density dependence can be interpreted either in terms of meson masses that are modified in the nuclear medium or in terms of variations in the scalar and vector self - energies .",
    "we can make three important observations about this additional density dependence : first , it can be parametrized efficiently using self - interactions of the meson fields .",
    "second , to make meaningful statements about the size of these self - interactions , one must include all allowed terms at the given level of truncation , as required by naturalness .",
    "this is relevant since most relativistic mean - field calculations to date have concentrated on scalar self - interactions only , omitting scalar  vector and vector  vector terms .",
    "third , although we choose to determine these interactions by fitting to empirical nuclear properties , one could instead fit them to the results of more detailed nuclear matter calculations based on an underlying lagrangian , such as dbhf .",
    "if the dbhf self - energies are determined from fits to nn observables , this alternative procedure provides a direct link between relativistic finite - nucleus structure calculations and the two - nucleon problem .    to address the chiral models , we considered specific lagrangians that realize the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd in different ways and studied them at the hartree level .",
    "the resulting energy functionals are special cases of the general one studied earlier , so we apply our previous analysis and test whether acceptable parametrizations can be obtained .",
    "we find that the accessible region for linear sigma models is far from the region of acceptable nuclear phenomenology .",
    "the results of this new analysis solidify our previous conclusion @xcite that chiral hadronic models built upon the conventional linear sigma model can not reproduce observed properties of finite nuclei , at least at the hartree level .",
    "the two critical constraints imposed by the conventional lagrangian are the `` mexican - hat '' potential and the connection between the scalar coupling and the pion coupling ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the former generates scalar self - interactions with the wrong systematics , and the latter produces a scalar mass that is too large , leading to unrealistic nuclear charge densities , level orderings , and shell closures .    on the other hand",
    ", one can find chiral models that _ are _ phenomenologically successful at the hartree level .",
    "as an example , we discuss a model that was introduced in a recent paper , which features a nonlinear realization of chiral symmetry .",
    "one motivation for such a model is that the chiral scalar present in the linear sigma model is irrelevant for the nuclear dynamics ; the mid - range nn attraction arises instead from the exchange of two correlated pions .",
    "one can simulate this attraction by introducing an auxiliary scalar field with a yukawa coupling to the nucleon .",
    "chiral symmetry is maintained if the nucleon field transforms nonlinearly and the auxiliary field is a chiral scalar . due to the nonlinear realization of the symmetry ,",
    "the `` mexican - hat '' potential is no longer needed , and various constraints on the model parameters disappear . at the hartree level ,",
    "the energy functional has the full flexibility of the general functional considered earlier ; thus , parameter sets can be found that accurately reproduce nuclear properties in a framework that is consistent with the underlying chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "moreover , we observe that successful models have parameters that are consistent with our `` naturalness '' assumption , which forms the basis for our expansion and truncation scheme .",
    "although the general mean - field approach studied here leads to excellent results for the bulk properties of nuclei , there are many questions to be answered before one has a consistent , systematic treatment of the relativistic nuclear many - body problem .",
    "a more accurate inclusion of vacuum , exchange , and correlation effects should be pursued .",
    "the extension of this framework to deal with high - density matter , where the expansion parameters are no longer small , is also an outstanding problem . some of these ideas will be discussed in a future paper @xcite .",
