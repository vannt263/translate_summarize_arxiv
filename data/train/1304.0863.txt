    "modeling of the attenuation of an electromagnetic wave as it propagates in space is a major component in the analysis and design of wireless systems .",
    "this phenomenon , also called propagation loss , is caused by the decay of the signal power with the distance from the emitter ( existing even in the free space propagation models ) and due to various obstacles between emitters and receivers ( trees , buildings , hills , etc . ) present in real network profiles . complexity and haphazard character of actual network profiles",
    "makes pertinent the statistical modeling of the propagation loss . in this approach ,",
    "the propagation loss between an emitter and a receiver , called _ path - loss _ , is typically modeled by the product of the _ distance - loss function _  a deterministic function of the distance between the two antennas , which represents average path - loss on the given distance in the network , and a random variable , called _ shadowing _ , that takes into account in a statistical manner the deviation from this average , observed for each particular pair of emitter and receiver .",
    "we call this model _ path - loss with shadowing_. the distance - loss function is commonly assumed to be some power of the distance , with the exponent called _ path - loss exponent_. the random variable of the shadowing is often assumed to have _ log - normal distribution _ , normalized to have mean one and parametrized by its variance or standard deviation .",
    "various qos metrics in cellular networks , as _ blocking probability _ for constant bit - rate ( cbr ) connections and _ spectral efficiency _ for variable bit - rate ( vbr ) connections , depend on the strength ( i.e. , variance ) of the shadowing .",
    "it is commonly believed that an increase of the variance of shadowing penalizes the network performance .",
    "the results presented in this paper shed some new light on this problem .",
    "namely , studying the blocking probability ( defined as the fraction of the cbr connections that can not be established due to insufficient transmission resources , in the long run of the system ) we have discovered that it is not always increasing with the variance of the shadowing .",
    "for example , in our model of the ofdma hexagonal network consisting of 36 bs , with cell radius @xmath0 km and the path - loss exponent equal to @xmath1 , the blocking probability evaluated at the presence of the log - normal shadowing with the standard deviation of 25db is four times smaller than in the scenario with no - shadowing .",
    "even if this spectacular example regards a very strong shadowing , we obtain a smaller , but still very significant , decrease of the blocking probability for the shadowing with the standard deviation from 7 to 15db , which might be appropriate for the indoor scenario ( user - indoors , bs - outdoors ) ; cf  @xcite .    in all cases ,",
    "a very strong shadowing ultimately makes the blocking probability tend to  1 and this dependence indeed becomes ( as expected ) monotone for higher path - loss exponent ( larger than 4 in the considered examples ) .    to explain the above , somewhat surprising , observations and extend them to other qos metrics",
    "we study the impact of the shadowing and the path - loss exponent on the following two key characteristics of any given mobile in the network :    * its _ path - loss to the serving bs _ , which is the one received with the strongest signal ( and not necessarily the closest one ) , * the so called mobile s _ interference factor _ , defined as the ratio of the sum of the path - gains form interfering bs to the path - gain from the serving bs .",
    "these are two key ingredients in the analysis of wireless cellular networks and thus their mean values can be considered as some qos `` pre - metrics '' . in particular , they are explicitly present in the call blocking condition  the one used to control the admission of streaming users , and hence intrinsically related to the blocking probability .",
    "they are , even more straightforwardly , related to the spectral efficiency of the data networks . while being key ingredients in the study of wireless systems , the ( mean ) qos pre - metric are also more easy to analyse .",
    "in particular they do not depend on a particular assumption regarding the spatial correlation of shadowing ( which is not the case , e.g. for the mean blocking probability ) .",
    "we have studied the mean values of the above two basic qos ingredients , with the averaging taken over all possible locations of users in the network and over the distribution of the shadowing .",
    "our main findings are as follows :    * the mean path - loss ( with respect to the serving bs ) is always increasing in the variance of the shadowing .",
    "the ultimate degradation of the qos for large shadowing variance is due to this increasing path - loss .",
    "( when possible , this may be however remedied by increasing the power of the emitted signals ) .",
    "* the mean interference factor is not monotonic in the variance of the shadowing .",
    "it first increases and then decreases ( asymptotically to zero ! ) , when the shadowing variance goes to infinity .",
    "this asymptotic behaviour can be heuristically explained by the _ single big jump principle _ of heavy - tailed distributions : the sum of the ( log - normal ) path - gains form all antennas is dominated by a big value of the path - gain from a single antenna .",
    "when this antenna is the serving one , then this big path - gain does not count in the interference , which becomes negligible in proportion to it .",
    "* the above two facts lead to the phenomenon that we may call a _ stochastic resonance for qos in path - loss - and - interference limited systems _ :",
    "when qos is not yet compromised by path - loss conditions , a moderate increase of the shadowing variance may make it profit from the reduction of the interference .",
    "we confirm the above findings by a mathematical analysis of the respective stochastic models .",
    "we also compare in this matter the performance of the perfect ( hexagonal ) and irregular ( poisson ) networks and find that both architectures exhibit very similar qos `` pre - metrics '' for the standard deviation of the shadowing larger than 20db .",
    "moreover , we prove an interesting invariance of the qos metrics of the infinite poisson cellular networks with respect to the distribution of the shadowing . as a consequence",
    "we also obtain fully explicit , analytical results for the mean path - loss and interference factors in the case of the infinite poisson network .    _ the remaining part of this paper _ is organized as follows . in the next section we briefly present related works . in section  [ s.modeldescription ]",
    "we describe our models .",
    "the main numerical results are presented in section  [ s.numerical ] .",
    "next , in section  [ s.mathematical ] we present mathematical analysis of the models , which supports and completes our numerical findings .",
    "finally , in section  [ s.concluding ] we provide some concluding remarks .",
    "the propagation loss model considered in this paper is commonly accepted in the literature ; see e.g. @xcite where log - normal shadowing of mean @xmath2 is considered .",
    "a possible extension of this model consists in assuming shadowing distribution ( say , its variance ) that depends on the distance , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the impact of the shadowing on the distribution of the interference factor is studied numerically in  @xcite and analytically in  @xcite .",
    "however , the above two articles do not take into account the modification of the network geometry induced by the shadowing , i.e. , assume that mobiles are served by their geographically closest bs .",
    "this is not a realistic assumption and , as we will show in this paper , leads to misleading conclusions that the shadowing dramatically increases the mean interference factor .",
    "the paper  @xcite focuses on the interference factor averaged over a given cell , and in particular the effect of shadowing on this average .",
    "it is shown there that the cell shape modification induced by the shadowing affects significantly the mean interference factor .",
    "more precisely , that this mean decreases substantially if mobiles are served by the bs offering the smallest path - loss .",
    "we adopt this assumption throughout the present paper in the context of regular ( hexagonal ) and irregular ( poisson ) geometry of bs , as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "some papers ( see e.g.  @xcite ) propose more explicit approximations of the interference factor and its moments ( mean and variance ) assuming only deterministic propagation loss models ( without random shadowing ) .",
    "@xcite studies the distribution of the interference factor in such a case .    in  @xcite",
    "the authors partially confirm , by a different approach , our early observation from  @xcite , that the average sir ( which is the inverse of the interference factor ) might increase with the shadowing variance when the best server policy is chosen .",
    "the interference factor was recognized very early as a key element in the performance evaluation of cellular networks ; cf .",
    "fundamental to our approach to the evaluation of the blocking probability are papers  @xcite .",
    "they show how the power allocation problem without power limitations can be reduced to an algebraic system of linear inequalities .",
    "moreover , they recognize that the spectral radius of the ( non - negative ) matrix corresponding to this system not greater than  1 is the necessary and sufficient condition of the feasibility of power allocation without power limitations .",
    "this approach lead to the development of a comprehensive framework of the evaluation of the blocking probability in cdma , hsdpa and ofdma , via a spatial version of the famous erlang s formula in  @xcite .",
    "qos in data networks are studied using this approach in @xcite .    finally , recalling that the mean qos pre - metrics studied in this paper do not depend on the spatial correlation of the shadowing , we remind  @xcite as bringing models that can be used when studying the spatial distribution of the qos metrics .",
    "in this paper we will consider two particular models for the location of bs , hexagonal and poisson one .",
    "the former is commonly considered as an `` ideal '' model for the cellular networks , while the latter one can be seen as an extremal case of very irregular network .      *",
    "_ hexagonal network .",
    "_ +   hexagonal pattern of @xmath3 bs on rectangular torus @xmath4 .",
    "identified points are denoted by the same digits or characters . ]",
    "+ consider bs located on a regular hexagonal grid on @xmath5 with the distance @xmath6 between two adjacent vertices of this grid;. ] cf .  figure  [ fig.t4 ] .",
    "note that the surface area of a given cell ( hexagon , i.e. subset of the plane whose points are closer to a given point of the grid than to any other ) of this model is equal to @xmath7 .",
    "thus the intensity of the bs in this model is equal to @xmath8 bs/@xmath9 . in what follows",
    "it will be customary to consider a stationary version @xmath10 of this grid , which can be obtained by randomly shifting it through a vector uniformly distributed in one given hexagon ( cf .",
    "* example  4.2.5 ) ) . in this model a given location ,",
    "say the origin of the plane , corresponds to an `` arbitrary '' location of a mobile , `` randomly chosen '' in the network . * _ poisson network .",
    "_ assume that bs are located at the points of a stationary , homogeneous poisson point process ( p.p . ) @xmath11 of intensity @xmath12 bs/@xmath9 on the plane @xmath5 . when comparing performance of poisson and hexagonal model we will always take them with the same intensity @xmath8 .",
    "considering infinite models is often a convenient way of studying phenomena arising in very large networks .",
    "a particular property of these models is lack of ( geographic ) boundary effects , which in real , large but finite , networks , have often a negligible impact on performance characteristics measured in the `` middle '' of the network .",
    "however , as we will see in this paper , sometimes mathematical assumption of an infinite network may create some artifacts , which are not observed in more realistic , large but finite , networks .      in order to have finite network models , and still neglect the boundary effects ( which might be reasonable for large networks )",
    "one often considers _",
    "toroidal model_. recall that , roughly speaking , rectangular torus is a rectangle whose opposite sites are `` identified '' . for @xmath13 , we will denote by @xmath14 the rectangle @xmath15 with toroidal metric . restricting @xmath10 to @xmath14 ,",
    "i.e. taking @xmath16 one obtains the model whose distribution is invariant with respect to translations on the torus .",
    "thus we obtain a hexagonal network model that consists of @xmath17 cells ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig.t4 ] ) and which does not exhibit any border effects .",

    "in what follows we will always assume that @xmath25 where @xmath26 , called _ distance - loss _ , is a non - decreasing , _",
    "deterministic _ function of the distance between an emitter and a receiver , and @xmath27 is a _ random shadowing field _ related to the bs @xmath23 . in what follows",
    "we call @xmath22 _ path - loss with shadowing _ ( or path - loss for short ) between @xmath23 and @xmath24 . moreover , we will always assume that given locations of bs @xmath28 their shadowing fields @xmath29 are _ independent _ non - negative stochastic processes , each being indexed by locations @xmath21 .",
    "more formally speaking , the locations of bs @xmath23 and their respective shadowing fields @xmath30 form an _ independently marked _",
    "version @xmath31 of the point process  @xmath32 .",
    "regarding the distribution of the marks ( shadowing fields ) of this process , they are assumed to have _ the same marginal distributions _ , i.e. , given @xmath23 , @xmath33 has the same distribution for all @xmath21 , of normalized mean @xmath34=1 $ ] , with the following two cases being of particular interest    * @xmath35 , which corresponds to a case with negligible shadowing ( we will say also `` no shadowing '' ) , * for all @xmath24 , @xmath33 is log - nornal random variable with mean  1 .",
    "recall that such a mean-1 log - normal variable @xmath36 can be expressed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is standard gaussian random variable ( with mean  0 and variance  1 ) with @xmath39 and some constant  @xmath40 .",
    "indeed , in this case @xmath41=e^{\\mu+\\sigma^2/2}=1 $ ] . note that if the shadowing is log - normal random variable then the path - loss ( at a given distance ) expressed in db is gaussian random variable .",
    "furthermore , in this context it is common to parametrize the log - normal shadowing by the standard deviation ( sd ) of @xmath36 expressed in db , i.e. , the sd of @xmath42",
    ". we will denote it by @xmath43 .",
    "with respect to the previous parametrization we have @xmath44 . throughout the paper",

    "we will implicitly assume also that mean _ path - gain _ is finite , i.e. , @xmath45<\\infty$ ] .",
    "note that this condition is satisfied for log - normal variable , indeed , in our case of mean-1 variable @xmath45=e^{\\sigma^2}=e^{v^2\\log^210/100}$ ] .    for the deterministic distance - loss function @xmath26 the following particular model",
    "is often used and will be our default assumption in this paper : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are some constants .",
    "in what follows we will assume that each given location @xmath21 is served by the bs @xmath49 with respect to which it has the weakest path - loss @xmath50 ( so , in other words , the strongest received signal , given all bs emit with the same power ) , i.e , such that @xmath51 with any tie - breaking rule .",
    "note that in the case of negligible shadowing ( @xmath52 ) and strictly increasing function @xmath26 the above policy corresponds to the geographically closest bs .",
    "note also that for our infinite network models with random shadowing , one has to prove that the minimum of the path - loss is achieved for some bs , i.e. , that @xmath53 is well defined .    note that @xmath50 is the path - loss experienced by a user located at @xmath24 with respect to its serving bs .",
    "obviously it determines the qos of this user ( we will be more specific on this in section  [ ss.blocking ] ) . in this context",
    "we will call it _ path - loss factor _ ] of user @xmath24 and denote by @xmath54 . note that it depends on the location @xmath24 but also on the path - loss conditions of this location with respect to all bs in the network @xmath55 .",
    "path - loss factor @xmath56 is typically not enough to determine the qos of a given user .      for a given location @xmath21",
    "we define the interference factor @xmath57 as @xmath58 provided @xmath53 is well defined .",
    "study of the path - loss and interference factors , which are relatively simple objects , can give an important insight into more involved qos metrics , such as blocking probability in streaming traffic and mean throughput in data traffic . in what follows we recall how @xmath56 and @xmath57 appear naturally in the evaluation of the blocking probabilities .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the relation between the path - loss and interference factors and the blocking probability .",
    "this relation , whose very essence can be explained by the famous erlang s loss formula , was observed in the current geometric context ( however without shadowing ) in  @xcite .    in order to evaluate the blocking probability",
    "it is necessary to specify the dynamics of call arrivals and their durations , as well as to identify the set of feasible configurations of users ( which can be served simultaneously at their requested bit - rates ) . to this regard ,",
    "consider _ a given realization of the netowrk with shadowing @xmath59 _ , and a spatio - temporal poisson arrival process of calls which require from the network some predefined transmission rates for some exponential transmission times .",
    "these rates can be maintained at the price of blocking of some call arrivals when a network congestion occurs .",
    "the fractions @xmath60 of blocked arrivals in the long run of the system is called the _ blocking probability_. by the famous _",
    "erlang s loss formula _ , it is equal to the conditional probability that in the stationary configuration of the ( non - blocked ) arrival process the system can not admit a new user , given all users in the current configuration can be served . moreover ,",
    "if the decision whether to block a given call ( or admit it ) is based on the verification of some _ feasibility condition _ that has the so called _ multi - erlang form _ , then the erlang s loss formula can be relatively easily evaluated , e.g. discretizing the values of the sinr and using _ kaufman - roberts algorithm_. a canonical form of the multi - erlang feasibility condition involves verification by each bs @xmath23 of the following condition @xmath61 where the summation is taken over all users ( including a new arrival ) to be served by the bs @xmath23 and @xmath62 is some function of the path - loss and interference factors of user @xmath24 .",
    "this condition guarantees sufficient wireless resources to maintain the predefined transmissions rates for all served mobiles .",
    "specific form of the function @xmath62 needs to be developed for each particular cellular technology ( taking into account the performance of the coding schemes , type of the multiplexing , etc . ) .",
    "below we show two examples borrowed from our previous studies .",
    "they give some insight into how the feasibility condition  ( [ eq : m - erlang ] ) depends on the user transmissions rates , it is supposed to guarantee .",
    "* for the down - link in the ofdma network @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the maximal bs power , @xmath65 is the fraction of this maximal power used in common ( pilot ) channels , @xmath66 is the intra - cell orthogonality factor ( usually assumed to be  0 in ofdma ) , @xmath38 external noise power , @xmath67 is the system bandwidth , @xmath68 is the required bit - rate @xmath68 of user and @xmath69 is the link performance function ( @xmath70 is the bit - rate per hz available when sinr is equal to @xmath71 ; e.g. , assuming additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel and the link performance closed to the optimal one , @xmath69 is given by the famous shannon s formula @xmath72 .",
