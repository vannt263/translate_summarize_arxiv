    "unfortunately , these models do not describe the underlying nature of ( possibly multiscale ) plasma organization in the reconnection layer where magnetic energy is being dissipated and the assumptions of ideal mhd do not apply . understanding the detailed plasma organization on all length scales , from the likely relatively small , plasma kinetic scales , to the potentially much larger scales on which astrophysical dynamical systems `` prepare '' reconnection sites , and where ideal mhd may be valid , is paramount for completing the theories of a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena and for interpreting space plasma measurements and astronomical observations .    in an effort to develop a picture of magnetic reconnection from first principles ,",
    "recent particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations have examined the dynamics of reconnection layers that start with a current sheet as thin as the plasma skin depth .",

    "these various simulations have revealed novel forms of small - scale plasma self - organization that are interesting in their own right , but that must ultimately be related to and embedded within the appropriate larger astrophysical contexts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while spacecraft measurements , which can be done in situ , can provide direct clues how to establish this embedding in space plasmas , in extrasolar contexts only an indirect relation can be established between the reconnection process and the observed emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "common features seen in many pic simulations of magnetic reconnection include the formation of chains of magnetic flux ropes ( in three dimensions with a guide field ; otherwise , the common terms `` islands '' or `` plasmoids '' may still be more appropriate ) , the merging of smaller flux ropes into larger ones , and an energization of the plasma in the reconnection layer . in three dimensional simulations ,",

    "evidence for a nonthermal spectrum is less solid .",
    "it remains poorly understood which processes limit the energy to which particles can be accelerated in fully dynamical , three - dimensional reconnection layers , and how do the particle energy spectrum , the degree of accelerated particle beaming , and the temporal evolution of the accelerated population depend on the parameters of the reconnection layer .    in this work",

    "the parameters of the simulations that did undergo reconnection are shown in table [ tab : simulations ] .",
    "we use the relativistic particle - in - cell ( pic ) plasma code tristan - mp @xcite to simulate the evolution of a reconnection configuration in a pair plasma . in a pic simulation",
    ", the number of macroparticles of each species located in each grid cell must be large enough to resolve variations in the current density and limit high - frequency particle noise .",
    "tristan - mp uses a current filtering algorithm to reduce high - frequency particle noise , substantially reducing the required number of macroparticles per cell per species .",
    "we initialize our simulations with 4 macroparticles per cell per species , which is fewer than found in other recent pic simulations @xcite . to verify that this low particle density does not lead to cell evacuation ,",
    "we calculate the total particle density including both species in each cell in run s1k025 during the flux rope merging phase discussed in section [ sec : results ] below . we find that the total particle density in each cell calculated with a cubic cloud - in - cell kernel of size equal to the grid spacing is always larger than 1 , with a total density larger than @xmath48 in over @xmath49 of cells .",
    "cells with low particle density occur in regions characterized by weak spatial field gradients that should not be sensitive to particle noise .",
    "the cells with strong field gradients that would be sensitive to particle noise invariably have a higher than average particle density .",
    "to ensure that the particle density is indeed sufficient to resolve the physics of reconnection , we have carried out two dimensional convergence tests , as well as a longer three dimensional test run with 80 particles per cell per species . in our simulations , the tearing instability leading to reconnection is seeded by numerical fluctuations that vary from simulation to simulation , so we do not expect all observables to be the same in each run at a given absolute time measured from the beginning of the simulation .",
    "we therefore compare measurable quantities in each simulation at similar points in their evolution ; typically , we calculate these quantities at the end of the flux rope merging phase , which is discussed in section [ sec : results ] below .",
    "the coarse time discretization employed in recording simulation output makes the determination of these evolution points imprecise .",
    "this results in inaccuracies in the estimation of observables that vary quickly with time ; such quantities will therefore vary with resolution even if the resolution is sufficient to capture the physics of reconnection .",
    "our two dimensional convergence tests use initial conditions matching those in the three dimensional simulations with @xmath34 and @xmath50 , but with a larger number , up to 16 , of macroparticles per species per cell .",
    "we find that the only significant discrepancy , up to @xmath51 , is seen in the peak linear growth rate of the kinetic tearing instability ; this quantity is very sensitive to the coarse time discretization because time differencing is required for growth rate calculation . to test that we have sufficient macroparticle density to account for 3d effects in our simulations , we also carry out a three dimensional simulation with 80 macroparticles per cell per species , and the same parameters as in run s2k025 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we again find that the measurable quantities do not deviate greatly from those found in run s2k025 , with the maximum deviation of @xmath52 again seen in the growth rate of the kinetic tearing instability .",
    "we also find that the evolution of the total magnetic energy and the particle energy spectrum in this simulation with higher macroparticle density does not differ greatly from that found in run s2k025 in section [ sec : energization ] .",
    "the main difference is that in the high - density simulation , the flux rope merging phase identified in section [ sec : results ] begins slightly later ; this may be understood as the result of slightly lower particle noise in the high density simulations , which results in later growth of instability .    to ensure that our simulations resolve the plasma skin depth , we set @xmath53 , where the skin depth is given by @xmath54 here",

    "this is a quantity that varies quickly with time near the end of the flux rope merging phase , so the apparent variation with resolution is again likely a result of coarse time discretization .",

    "this implies that @xmath69 , ensuring that the drift velocities are not relativistic .",
    "the uniform initial density and temperature and nonuniform magnetic field in the initial configuration defined by equations ( [ eq : harris_field ] ) , ( [ curdrift ] ) , and ( [ eq : beta_profile ] ) are not in force balance , but they achieve approximate force balance following a brief readjustment . the initial adjustment to equilibrium results in a reduction of the current sheet thickness and an accompanying compression of the plasma by a factor @xmath70 where henceforth , @xmath71 denotes the current sheet half - thickness after the readjustment .",
    "we further define @xmath72 to denote the light crossing times of the initial and the compressed current sheet .",
    "the plasma takes @xmath73 to adjust to a state close to pressure equilibrium .",
    "the magnitude of the compression is shown in table [ tab : simulations ] .",
    "with readjustment , both the density of the particles and the strength of the guide field increase in the center of the current sheet in such a way as to balance the large pressure gradient that the reversing field exhibits from the center to the surface of the current sheet .",
    "longer - term transients are present in the form of acoustic oscillations .",
    "these oscillations could have the effect of enhancing the tearing instability , which relies on a velocity inflow to the current sheet",
    ". the initial readjustment does not give rise to any significant magnetic dissipation or particle energization .",
    "for a simulation to capture the physics of reconnection , its size must be sufficient to include the fastest growing modes of the important instabilities of relativistic harris current sheets in pair plasmas .",
    "the known instabilities include the kinetic relativistic tearing instability ( kti ; hereafter the tearing mode ) , the drift - kink instability ( dki ; hereafter the kink mode ) , and the oblique mode which is similar to the tearing mode . to estimate their wavelengths , we follow @xcite .",

    "the resulting maximum growth rate occurs for @xmath80 , corresponding to a wavelength of @xmath81 .",
    "if we use the form of @xmath82 appropriate at ultrarelativistic temperatures , the growth rate for this mode is @xmath83    the situation is more complicated for the kink mode , because as @xcite find , the analytical maximum value of the growth rate @xmath84 occurs for @xmath85 , a wavenumber for which kinetic effects become important in a thin current sheet .",
    "simulation results in their figure 20 indicate that the maximum growth rate occurs at @xmath86 corresponding to a wavelength of @xmath87 .",
    "in addition to these two dimensional modes , it is also necessary to resolve oblique modes with @xmath88 that combine tearing and kink components ; these were identified in three dimensional simulations by @xcite and @xcite . the typical fastest - growing oblique mode in both of these simulations had @xmath89 ; this corresponds to a wavelength in both directions of @xmath90 .    to resolve all three types of modes , in all simulations except for the larger size run s2k025l , we set @xmath91 , large enough to contain at least one wavelength of the tearing mode and two wavelengths of the kink mode . because the initial adjustment leads to a significant narrowing of the current sheet ,",
    "several wavelengths of the fastest - growing tearing and drift - kink modes of the narrower current sheet are included in the simulations , and at least one wavelength of the oblique modes should also be resolved .",
    "the resulting overall length scales are @xmath92 and @xmath93 or @xmath94 , depending on the simulation , as is shown in table [ tab : simulations ] . to ensure that little interaction takes place between the two current sheets in the periodic box , we set @xmath95 .",

    "the growth times of the tearing and kink modes are on the same order as and smaller than the alfvn crossing time of the box . to capture the physics of reconnection in its nonlinear regime and on length scales similar to the box size , the duration of the simulation must be larger than these time scales .",

    "the evolution of the reconnection layer in all simulations exhibits the same common that have been observed in previous pic simulations of magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas .",
    "the tearing instability grows and produces a chain of alternating x - lines and flux ropes .",
    "here , we adopt `` flux ropes '' to denote a magnetic structure sometimes referred to as `` plasmoid '' ( or `` island '' in two dimensional treatments ) in which plasma is pinched by a helical magnetic field which can have a braided structure .",

    "the flux ropes can also split into sub - ropes , which opens the possibility of an organization of the ropes in a flux rope network . in all simulations except for s1k0 where the kink instability disrupts the current sheet , the flux ropes merge in quasi - hierarchical fashion until either only one flux rope is left in each current sheet or , in the large simulation s2k025l , the flux ropes have been disrupted by a transition to a disordered , three - dimensional state .",

    "the waves traverse the computational box several times in the course of the simulation .",

    "very similar substructure also appears in the recent two - dimensional pic simulations of an electron - ion plasma by @xcite .    to examine three dimensional aspects of the current sheet evolution , in figure [ fig : projections ] we show projections into the @xmath116 plane of the total current density @xmath117 , plasma number density @xmath113 , and the parallel electric field magnitude @xmath118 in each of the two current sheets in simulation s2k025l",
    "the flux ropes that initially develop from the linear tearing instability are approximately parallel to the @xmath114 axis , which is the direction of the initial current flow .",
    "however , each flux rope exhibits one or more discontinuities where the @xmath119 coordinate of the rope suddenly changes .",

    "the linkage implies each flux rope experiences a strongly @xmath114-dependent magnetic tension force .",
    "this magnetic tension from neighboring flux ropes leads to rope tilting and kinking that is very distinct in origin from that arising from the well - known linear oblique and kink instabilities of a current sheet .",
    "pairs of large flux ropes emerging from two generations of flux rope merging , but still oriented largely parallel to the @xmath114 axis , are often connected by minor flux ropes that are highly tilted toward the @xmath119 axis . @xcite",
    "have discovered similar structures in a large three - dimensional simulation of electron - ion reconnection with a strong guide field .",
    "it is clear in figure [ fig : projections ] that by @xmath123 , all flux rope segments have substantial tilts and any semblance of translational invariance in the direction of the original current flow is lost .",
    "vertices of the flux rope network contain highly localized , intense current sheets and filaments .",
    "by @xmath124 , the flux ropes are largely completely disrupted and the current sheet contains a disordered network of knot- and sheet - like structures .    the force @xmath125 peaks at the primary x - line current sheets as well as flux rope perimeters , but is on average much smaller in flux rope interiors .",
    "this suggests that the flux rope interiors are organized in a state of force free quasi - equilibrium constrained by a nonvanishing magnetic helicity ( i.e. , twisting , braiding of the field lines ) .      to gain further insight into the structure of the flux rope network",
    ", we examine the spatial variation of @xmath126 , the component of the electric field parallel to the magnetic field . the parallel field vanishes for the purely inductive electric field of ideal mhd and thus it can be obtained purely from the non - ideal , reconnection electric field @xmath127 defined as the difference between the actual and the induction electric field , @xmath128 in high magnetic reynolds number plasmas , the parallel field is present only in magnetic diffusion regions , and in particular , in locations where a change of magnetic connectivity is under way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the conversion of magnetic to kinetic energy is substantially weaker than in the other simulations .",
    "we also note that the rate of development and evolution of the flux rope network exhibits similar behavior in the sense that flux ropes of a given size assemble later ( @xmath223 vs.   @xmath224 ) in the @xmath222 and s1k025 simulations .",
    "the variation of @xmath217 and of the overall evolution rate with @xmath31 is likely a consequence of the decrease of plasma compressibility with increasing guide field strength ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , we will find below that the spectrum exhibits the strongest evolution during the flux rope merging phase ; because the merging phase is complete by the reference time in all the simulations , it seems that the differences in the level of energization between the runs can not be attributed solely to the differences in the rate of reconnection .    in order to quantify the degree of particle energization in the simulations , following @xcite ,",
    "we compute the particle kinetic energy @xmath228 contained in the difference between the measured spectrum and a thermal spectrum containing the same number of particles and the same energy at particle energies at which the measured spectrum is in excess of the thermal spectrum .",
    "we then calculate the ratio of @xmath228 to the total particle kinetic energy @xmath64 , both computed at the end of the simulation .",
    "it is worth remarking that we do _ not _ go as far as @xcite to identify the particles contributing to @xmath228 as a nonthermal population ; the following section we show this tail may be better described with a combination of several thermal populations .",
    "consistent with the trend observed in the shape of the spectrum , we find that @xmath229 , which is shown in table [ tab : simulations ] , is the largest in the simulations with the higher magnetization @xmath34 and at most moderate guide field @xmath226 and is the smallest in simulation s1k1 with lower magnetization @xmath100 and strong guide field @xmath227 . thus , in contrast with @xcite , we find that @xmath229 decreases with increasing guide field .",
    "the reason for this dissimilarity seems to be that the kink instability does not compromise the development of reconnection in any of our simulations other than s1k0 ; even in that run , a minor flux rope merger occurs before the current sheet is disrupted . without the kink instability , more particle energization can take place .",
    "another possibly more interesting measure of particle energization is the ratio of the kinetic energy in energized particles to the magnetic energy converted to kinetic energy . combining equations ( [ eq : harris_field ] ) and",

    "the ratio , which ranges between @xmath236 and @xmath237 , is shown in table [ tab : simulations ] .",
    "the trend seen at low magnetization @xmath100 is an increase of @xmath238 with guide field strength , approximately the opposite of that seen in @xmath229 .",
    "the trend can be understood by noting that , as we will find in section [ sec : energization_mechanism ] , most of the particle energization contributing to @xmath228 occurs in x - line regions .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath219 measures the change in magnetic energy both during reconnection in x - line regions and , more importantly , during the subsequent contraction of reconnected magnetic field lines into flux ropes .",

    "radiation emitted by beams of accelerated particles can come in and out of view of an observer ; at any given time , the observer detects only the radiation emitted by particles with momenta making angles @xmath276 from the line of sight .",
    "such beaming could explain the temporal variability often seen in astrophysical sources , such as grbs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , blazars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that may be powered by reconnection .",
    "it could also influence the characteristics of the gamma - ray emission from other candidate reconnection - powered astrophysical sources , such as magnetars @xcite and pulsar wind nebulae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we investigate the angular distribution of the momenta of the highest energy particles in our simulation , and compare with the results of @xcite , who recently reported a high degree of beaming in a two - dimensional pic simulation of pair plasma reconnection initialized with @xmath277 .",
    "figure [ fig : directions ] shows the orientations of the momenta of all of the electrons and ions with @xmath278 in simulation s2k025l .",
    "we select the larger simulation for this analysis to include a larger range of three - dimensional effects to which the particle anisotropy may be sensitive .",
    "the median inclination of electrons ( ions ) to the @xmath114-axis ( negative @xmath114-axis ) is @xmath279 , hence a half of particles in each charge species occupies a fraction @xmath280 of the full solid angle .",
    "this moderate degree of beaming is a natural consequence of x - line acceleration by the electric field in the reconnection region , since the electric field is uniform and accelerates the particles preferentially along the @xmath114-axis .",
    "the degree of beaming , however , is much smaller than in @xcite , where the highest energy particles , with lorentz factors @xmath281 , were strongly beamed , occupying a solid angle fraction as small as @xmath282 .",
    "the dependence of the beaming on the parameters of the reconnection layer can crudely be understood as follows .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the plasma is ultrarelativistic and highly magnetized , and that the energy of the accelerated particle increases by a large factor , the components of its momentum following acceleration are approximately @xmath283 and @xmath284 , where @xmath285 is the initial lorentz factor of an accelerated particle , and @xmath286 is the lorentz factor gain during acceleration , which increases the particle momentum in the @xmath114 direction .",
    "therefore , the particle s degree of beaming is proportional to @xmath287 . using @xmath288 , where @xmath289 is the accelerating electric field ( equation [ rece ] ) and @xmath290 is the duration of acceleration ( equation [ eq : tau_merge ] ) , and expressing the magnetic field in terms of the magnetization parameter @xmath291 , where @xmath235 ( equations [ eq : sigma_uniform ] and [ plasma ] ) , we obtain @xmath292 this result is accurate in the regime @xmath293 whereas cerutti et al .  set up their simulation with @xmath294 . ignoring this concern",
    ", we estimate that the factors in parentheses on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : beaming_scaling ] ) are similar in our simulation and in cerutti et al .",
    "we therefore expect that the beaming solid angle @xmath295 in their simulation should be smaller by the inverse ratio of the 3s in the two simulations , which is @xmath296 .",
    "thus , the crude expectation is that the particles accelerated in cerutti et al.should more beamed within a solid angle over an order of magnitude smaller than in our simulation , consistent with the observed beaming ratio between the two simulations . in conclusion",
    ", this analysis suggests that high magnetization and large physical size of the x - line region can both give rise to a high degree of beaming .",
    "a number of studies have examined the three - dimensional evolution of a current sheet without a guide field ; here , we focus on results relevant to pair plasmas .",
    "@xcite found that the kink mode dominated the tearing mode in antiparallel reconnection .",
    "in contrast , @xcite found that the initial evolution was dominated by the tearing mode , leading to an initial merging phase similar to that in two dimensions .",
    "after the completion of the merging phase , however , they found that a secondary kink instability set in and rendered the reconnection region turbulent and filled with plasmoids covering a range of dimensions . the reduced influence of the kink mode in the simulations of @xcite may be explained by initially relativistic drift velocities of @xmath297 .",
    "analytical calculations suggest that while the kink mode dominates at low drift velocities , the tearing mode becomes dominant for drift velocities exceeding @xmath298 @xcite .",
    "however , the growth rate of the kink mode , unlike the tearing mode , depends strongly on the initial structure of the current sheet @xcite .    in guide field reconnection",
    ", previous three dimensional studies have found that the kink mode is stabilized , but , under certain conditions , oblique modes dominate the evolution .",
    "@xcite found that with a guide field present , the tearing mode and a sausage - like mode are combined into an oblique `` relativistic - drift - sausage - tearing '' mode .",
    "@xcite found that in electron - ion plasmas , oblique modes give rise to a network of interconnected flux ropes . in both cases ,",
    "the nonlinear development of the oblique modes led to turbulence in the current sheet . in nonrelativistic electron - ion simulations with a strong guide field",
    ", @xcite found that at low temperatures , the current sheet filamented and that the turbulent transport played a key role in the diffusion of the field . at higher ,",
    "albeit still nonrelativistic temperatures , their filamentation instability became weaker and the current sheet did not become turbulent .",
    "one must be aware of the possibility that unlike the tearing mode , the other instabilities identified in simulations starting with harris sheet equilibria are idiosyncrasies of the initial configuration and have little to do with astrophysical magnetic reconnection .",
    "our simulation , starting from a non - harris like configuration lacking a density enhancement in the initial current sheet , should help discern artifacts of the initial configurations from genuine properties of reconnection dynamics .",
    "we have found that in our simulations , in which we considered guide fields at most equal to the reversing field , the tearing mode dominates the evolution at all guide field strengths . to understand the difference between our simulations without guide field and the studies that detected a dominant kink mode , we have carried out two dimensional simulations with @xmath34 and @xmath50 in both the @xmath205 and @xmath299 planes .",
    "we find that the kink mode grows faster in a harris current sheet , while the tearing mode grows faster starting with our initial conditions .",
    "our initial configuration seems to enhance the growth rate of the tearing mode and inhibit the growth of the kink mode .",
    "the plasma inflow occurring during readjustment to equilibrium may enhance growth of the tearing mode above the value expected in pressure equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , our initial configuration may be endowed with a somewhat stronger drift velocity shear than the harris sheet and this could stabilize the kink mode @xcite while having little effect on the tearing mode @xcite .    in our simulations with guide field , we do not find any oblique modes similar to those observed by @xcite or @xcite .",
    "therefore , the only linear mode present is the tearing mode ; the lack of phase coherence is the mechanism responsible for breaking translational symmetry .",
    "because this mechanism is a general result of causal constraints , it is likely that this mechanism is present in harris current sheets as well as in our simulations , but is masked by the more rapid effects of kink and oblique modes .",

    "because the fastest - growing tearing wavelength computing from the theoretical result in equation ( [ eq : tearing ] ) is @xmath304 and the box size in all by simulation s2k025l is @xmath305 , the number of flux ropes per current sheet produced by the tearing mode should be @xmath306 ; the number should be twice as large in s2k025l .",
    "the actual number of flux ropes formed in the simulation is agreement with this prediction , with the exception of the simulation s2k1 with the strongest guide field .",
    "this run produced only 2 flux ropes per current sheet even though one expects 4 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the strong guide field may prefer oblique rather than pure tearing modes , but the former grow the fastest at long wavelengths @xmath307 , about half the box size of the simulation , and the finite box size interferes with ability of arbitrary oblique modes to grow .",
    "the values of @xmath300 for the various runs are shown in table [ tab : tearing ] ; it should be noted that these are upper limits to the possible tearing mode growth rates , because any measured growth rates are found from estimates in the nonlinear regime .",
    "we also compute the simulated growth rates @xmath301 of the tearing mode in our simulations by calculating the growth rate of the average reconnected magnetic field perturbation @xmath57 in the current sheet .",
    "growth rates of the kti calculated with the latter method should be higher than those obtained by examining a single fourier mode , as we did in section [ sec : mode_analysis ] , because multiple fourier modes contribute to the amplitude of the perturbation .",

    "@xcite identified a similar discrepancy between the theoretical and simulated growth rates .",
    "the growth rates also show that decreased guide field @xmath31 , and especially higher magnetization @xmath27 , lead to higher tearing mode growth rates both in theoretical calculations and in the simulations .",
    "this reinforces the effects of the variation in @xmath303 , which has a similar dependence on @xmath27 and @xmath31 .",
    "we have shown that the tearing mode is responsible for producing magnetic flux ropes in most of our simulations .",
    "the tearing mode can also explain many of the differences between the simulations .",
    "the runs with higher @xmath27 and smaller @xmath31 have larger values of @xmath302 , which leads to higher tearing mode growth rates and the formation of a larger number of flux ropes @xmath303 .",
    "the faster evolution of runs with higher @xmath27 and smaller @xmath31 can be explained by the faster growth of the tearing mode in such runs .",
    "because runs with higher @xmath27 and smaller @xmath31 are also associated with a larger @xmath303 , more flux rope merging can take place in such runs .",
    "flux rope merging is strongly associated with energy transfer and particle acceleration ( as we show in the following sections ) , so the larger energy transfer in runs with higher @xmath27 and smaller @xmath31 can be explained by the larger @xmath303 in those runs .",
    "this suggests that a large portion of the variation between runs is a result of the effect of @xmath27 and @xmath31 on the tearing mode .",
    "various particle energization channels have been identified in pic simulations of plasma reconnection ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "three specific loci where particle energization was detected include : inside or near the diffusion region containing reconnection x - lines , in the magnetic islands ( or plasmoids , flux ropes ) where the reconnected magnetic flux accumulates , and between an x - line and the edge of a flanking island , where the plasma flowing out of the x - line first encounters a strong magnetic field gradient .",
    "a number of studies point to the conclusion that significant energization occurs near the primary ( i.e. , largest , or highest rank ) x - lines . there ,",
    "the electric field , which is perpendicular to the reversing field and is aligned with the current density vector in the middle of the current sheet , can accelerate particles oscillating within or across the current sheet ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "a variant of this mechanism involves the trapping of particles in secondary magnetic islands appearing within the diffusion region of an x - line @xcite ; we will not discuss this as we do not observe secondary flux rope formation in our simulations .",
    "particles can also be accelerated outside of the x - lines , such as in primary magnetic islands .",
    "if an island contracts in the course of its relaxation to mhd equilibrium , the particles trapped inside it can be accelerated by a fermi - type process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet another location for particle acceleration is in the pileup region between the x - line and a flanking island , which is where the reconnected magnetic flux accumulates .",
    "there , relativistic speiser motion can combine with curvature drift along the magnetic field gradient to create significant acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these mechanisms can operate in reconnection sites where the plasma configuration , involving inflow into the diffusion region and outflow toward the flanking islands , is relatively stationary , or inside a single , autonomously evolving magnetic island . there may be other mechanisms that operate in course of spatial rearrangement and merging of magnetic islands .",
    "converging islands can give rise to fermi - type acceleration as particles bounce between them ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a dynamically active reconnection region containing many interacting islands can also allow fermi - type stochastic particle acceleration @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that even if particle acceleration is not directly driven by the merging , it is normally most active during island merging episodes in the course of a reconnection event @xcite .",
    "the presence of a guide field has a significant effect on particle acceleration in reconnection @xcite . without a guide field ,",
    "the direct x - line acceleration was typically found to be less efficient than the other mechanisms discussed . however , with a guide field , the effectiveness of acceleration in the pileup region @xcite and inside magnetic islands @xcite was diminished , thus leaving x - line acceleration of particles on speiser orbits as the dominant mechanism .",
    "our results are consistent with this conclusion .    to permit an interpretation of the nonthermal radiation spectra in observed high - energy astrophysical sources in terms of synchrotron and inverse - compton radiation , a relatively hard power law particle energy spectrum , which places a significant portion of the total energy in high - energy particles , is required . in most pic simulations including the present work , reconnection produced energized particle populations , but whether the populations represented genuine power laws tails has remained a matter of interpretation .",
    "alternatively , an energized population can be interpreted as a composite of one or more thermal sub - populations , each at a different temperature , for example .",
    "two dimensional simulations typically provide the dynamic range to make a tentative distinction between a thermal or a power law spectrum in an energized population . in most three - dimensional simulations ,",
    "however , such a determination is dubious . in what follows",
    ", we discuss the characteristics of the particle energy spectra in the literature and provide a comparison with our results .",
    "then , we briefly reflect on the expected nature of particle energy spectra produced by systems experiencing magnetic reconnection .",
    "most investigations involving pic simulations of plasma reconnection have interpreted a section of the high energy tail of the particle energy spectrum as a power law @xmath308 . in the x - line region of two dimensional simulations , spectra with power law indices as hard as @xmath309 have been reported @xcite .",
    "the spectrum in the whole simulation box also contains a power law component , but with a softer index of @xmath310 . in their two- and three - dimensional simulations of shock - induced reconnection ,",
    "@xcite find that as long as the region containing a reversing magnetic field that can undergo reconnection is reasonably large compared to the thickness of the reconnection layer , the particle energy spectrum at high energies is a power law with an index @xmath311 over a decade in energy .",
    "other three dimensional investigations have identified relatively soft power law spectra with indices @xmath312 both in the x - line region and in the entire simulation box @xcite .",
    "other investigations have interpreted particle energy spectra in terms of multiple thermal and other exponentially truncated populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in their two - dimensional simulation of reconnection in an initially nonrelativistic plasma at temperature @xmath313 ,",
    "@xcite find a new thermal population at temperature @xmath314 .",
    "in a three - dimensional simulation beginning with a relativistic plasma at temperature @xmath315 , @xcite find that a thermal population with @xmath316 is produced .",
    "in a recent work presenting two - dimensional simulations without a guide field , @xcite detect a spectrum of the form @xmath317 , where @xmath318 is a constant of the order of unity .    among the cited descriptions of particle populations energized by reconnection , the spectra observed in our simulations bear resemblance with those involving multiple thermal sub - populations .",
    "for example , the spectrum at the end of simulation s2k025l can be modeled with three thermal components at temperatures similar to those found in @xcite ; specifically , the two energized sub - populations have temperatures @xmath319 and @xmath320 .",
    "neither a power law nor the @xcite spectral form present a good fit to the spectrum in this simulation .",
    "it is important to note that the continued evolution of the particle energy spectrum we observe after the current sheet has become disordered , and the likely additional evolution that would be taking place in am even larger simulation , mean that the spectral form has not converged .",
    "for example , it is possible that in addition to the two thermal components that we have detected , additional such populations at still higher temperatures would appear in larger simulations , and that the combination of those would constitute a hard spectral tail , e.g. , a power law .    in pic simulations",
    ", distinguishing between the various forms of energized particle spectra is difficult due to dynamic range limitations .",
    "another complication is how the spectrum of the non - energized , yet possibly adiabatically heated background plasma is to be subtracted to isolate the genuine nonthermal component .",
    "insight can separately be gained by examining test particle trajectories in magnetic field geometries modeling reconnection layers .",
    "particle ballistics in x - line as well as magnetic island geometries introduced at various levels of approximation has been investigated in numerous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "often , the models entail transport terms describing particle acceleration while confined in a single x - line region or an island , and other terms describing particle escape and the termination of acceleration .",
    "then , the terminal energy spectrum of the escaping particles is obtained by taking the input energy spectrum and deterministically transforming it by the transport terms .",
    "the crudest such models have suggested that the terminal spectrum could be a power law , e.g. , of the form @xmath321 with @xmath322 , where @xmath323 is the reconnected magnetic field and @xmath324 is the electric field in the reconnection region discussed in section [ sec : reconnection_rate ] @xcite .",
    "models taking a more detailed accounting of the transport of particle phase space coordinates and the kinematics of escape , however , can instead imply distinctly non - power - law , softer spectra ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is also important to note that the breaking of translational invariance in the direction of the current , e.g. , by three dimensional phase decoherence ( see section [ sec : network ] ) , may limit particle acceleration and prevent the production of the same energized particle tail produced in two dimensional geometries .",
    "power - law spectra are generically expected in acceleration processes entailing stochasticity .",
    "a prime example is the linear diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) in which the random outcome of particle scattering in the shock downstream determines whether the particle will return to the shock upstream and be subjected to another acceleration cycle @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the acceleration in an idealized time - independent and two - dimensional x - line region that lacks substructure in the form of secondary and embedded islands , should be deterministic",
    ". therefore the models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , can be thought of as producing a power - law - like spectrum only `` by coincidence . '' realistic reconnection regions should plausibly allow particles to be accelerated in stochastic fashion as they contain time dependence and structure on multiple scales ; they may also have a mechanism for returning particles that have escaped an acceleration site into another such site ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since in this work we have found that the reconnection layer transitions into a disordered network of interacting flux ropes , it will be particularly interesting to investigate , in subsequent study , if this network allows for stochastic acceleration of particles in intermittent , secondary reconnection sites that may appear in the course of the flux rope network evolution .",
    "in this paper , we carried out three dimensional pic simulations of magnetic reconnection in a relativistic pair plasma with varying guide field strength .",
    "plasma magnetizations , expressed in terms of the magnetic to kinetic pressure ratio , were of the order of unity .",
    "the initial conditions differed from the usual harris sheet configuration by not having a large density contrast between the center of the current sheet and the background plasma .",
    "we investigated the growth of unstable kinetic modes in the current sheet , as well as the nonlinear development of a three dimensional flux rope network .",
    "we also investigated the character and efficiency of particle energization .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    the current sheets in all simulations develop significant magnetic reconnection accompanied with conversion of magnetic to particle kinetic energy . with the aid of fourier decomposition , we ascertained that the linear tearing mode is dominant in the early evolution of the current sheet .",
    "we find that no significant growth occurs in the linear kink and oblique modes .",
    "the nonlinear development of the tearing mode produces a chain of flux ropes separated by primary x - lines .",
    "the flux ropes merge in hierarchical fashion whereby the merging time scale is proportional to the flux rope separation . during this phase magnetic",
    "reconnection takes place at the x - lines .",
    "we find that the dimensionless reconnection rates @xmath325 and the maximum outflow speeds @xmath326 in our simulations are similar to those detected in other three dimensional simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas .",
    "we also find that spatial variation of an off - diagonal component of the pressure tensor is responsible for the breaking of flux freezing at the x - lines , consistent with existing results .    while the hierarchical flux rope merging process initially appears similar to that found in two dimensional simulations , in fact it is three - dimensional from the outset .",
    "this is because a lack of initial phase coherence in the linear tearing mode on scales larger than those allowed by causality breaks translational invariance in the direction of the initial current flow .",
    "the flux ropes form a topologically interconnected , dynamically evolving network .",
    "dynamical interaction between neighboring flux ropes is provided by magnetic tension forces . with time",
    ", the flux ropes break up into segments with more isotropic orientations .",
    "the strongly three - dimensional character of the reconnection layer seems to suggest that global reconnection models invoking quasi - two - dimensional plasmoid hierarchies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) require revision to account for the inter - plasmoid magnetic linkage and isotropization of plasmoid orientations .",
    "the larger flux ropes produced during flux rope merging contain substructure down to plasma skin depth scales which is reflected in embedded , twisted and braided current filaments and sheets .",
    "overall , this substructure is force - free and evolves relatively slowly .",
    "however , isolated sites within the evolved flux rope network contain spatially and temporally intermittent sites characterized by strong nonideal conditions @xmath327 where a change of magnetic connectivity continues to take place even after flux rope merging has saturated on length scales equal to the size of the computational box .",
    "this intermittency may produce the observed variability of nonthermal emission in systems in which the emitting particles are energized by magnetic reconnection .    during the early ,",
    "ordered flux rope merging phase , particles are accelerated to high lorentz factors by the electric field in primary x - lines ; the trajectories of these particles are well described by speiser orbits .",
    "particles continue to be energized in the later , disordered phase we identify in our largest simulation , but we leave the analysis of energization in the disordered regime to a subsequent investigation .    simulations with higher magnetization and lower guide field strength exhibit greater and faster energy conversion and particle energization .",
    "the efficiency of particle energization measured in terms of the energy in the accelerated particles per unit magnetic energy dissipated in the simulation is an increasing function of the guide field strength , which can be interpreted as resulting from a decreasing plasma compressibility with increasing guide field .",
    "the final particle energy spectrum in the largest simulation is best fit by the inclusion of new thermal components at temperatures @xmath328 , and @xmath329 , in addition to the initial thermal component with temperature @xmath330 .",
    "we , however , acknowledge that a larger size or longer duration simulation is likely to produce a still more pronounced energized component , possibly even a population described with a power law spectrum .    energetic positrons ( electrons ) with lorentz factors @xmath254 are moderately beamed in ( opposite to ) the direction of the initial current flow with median inclinations of @xmath279 .",
    "the degree of beaming is determined by a particle s energy gain during acceleration .",
    "we speculate that more highly magnetized plasmas and reconnection sites with larger size x - line regions should give rise to stronger beaming .    in this work , we have investigated a narrow range of magnetizations with @xmath331 , but astrophysical reconnection sites can also have high magnetizations @xmath332 .",
    "we can speculate about the applicability of our results in the latter limit .",
    "the linear tearing mode responsible for the initiation of reconnection is insensitive to the degree of magnetization far from the current sheet .",
    "the phase decoherence that produces the initial breakdown of translational invariance is determined by the tearing mode growth time and should thus also persist at high magnetizations .",
    "therefore , we expect the qualitative structure of the reconnection region at higher values of @xmath27 to be similar to that found in our simulations .",
    "the primary effect of high magnetization is that the alfvn velocity approaches the speed of light , which could give rise to ultrarelativistic outflows from the x - line region . in such outflows",
    "the inertial term of the generalized ohm s law becomes important in the breaking of flux freezing @xcite .",
    "this in turn may increase the dimensionless reconnection rate @xmath182 relative to the value found in our simulations .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the associated reconnection process is more or less intermittent .",
    "an increased magnetization is likely to increase the efficiency and the degree of beaming in particle energization .",
    "we consider these results and the immediate questions they raise an incremental step in the development of a multiscale view of collisionless plasma self - organization during magnetic reconnection .",
    "further work is clearly required to place our key finding , the evolution of the simulated , periodic reconnection layer into a disordered network of interacting magnetic flux ropes , in the macroscopic context of a realistic reconnection site characterized by outflow boundary conditions and altogether different field line asymptotics at large distances from the x - line .",
    "it will be particularly interesting to see if the reconnected - flux - carrying outflow from the macroscopic x - line will possess the disordered , interlinked magnetic field topology we observe and investigate what will be the character of magnetic fluctuations in the outflow .",

    "<S> we confirm that the primary energization mechanism is acceleration by the electric field in the x - line region . </S>",
    "<S> the highest energy positrons ( electrons ) are moderately beamed with median angles @xmath0 relative to ( the opposite of ) the direction of the initial current density , but we speculate that reconnection in more highly magnetized plasmas would give rise to stronger beaming . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we discuss the implications of our results for macroscopic reconnection sites , and which of our results may be expected to hold in systems with higher magnetizations . </S>"
