    "the study of @xmath0-jet and @xmath4-meson production at high - energy colliders , such as the fermilab tevatron and the cern large hadron collider , is of great interest for the test of perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "the presence of a heavy @xmath0 quark , with mass @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the asymptotic scale parameter of qcd , in such processes guarantees a large momentum transfer even if the transverse momentum of the produced @xmath0 quark is small .",
    "thus , the strong - coupling constant remains small in the processes discussed here , @xmath7 .",
    "the study of @xmath0-jet production should provide a more direct way to investigate gluon and quark interactions at small distances than that of @xmath4-meson production because , in the former case , there is no need for additional assumptions concerning the non - perturbative dynamics of the transition from a @xmath0 quark to a @xmath4 meson @xcite .",
    "the total center - of - mass ( cm ) energy at the tevatron , @xmath8  tev in run  ii , sufficiently exceeds the scale @xmath9 of the relevant hard processes , so that @xmath10 .",
    "in such a high - energy regime , the contributions to the production cross section from subprocesses involving @xmath1-channel exchanges of partons ( gluons and quarks ) may become dominant .",
    "then , the transverse momenta of the incoming partons and their off - shell properties can no longer be neglected , and we deal with _",
    "@xmath1-channel partons . in this",
    "so - called quasi - multi - regge kinematics ( qmrk ) , the particles ( multi - regge ) or groups of particles ( quasi - multi - regge ) produced in the collision are strongly separated in rapidity . in the case of inclusive @xmath0-jet production , this implies the following : a single @xmath0 quark is produced in the central region of rapidity , while other particles , including a @xmath11 quark , are produced at large rapidities . in the case of associated @xmath3-pair production in the central rapidity region , we also assume that there are no other particles in this region , so that the @xmath3 pair is considered as a quasi - multi - regge pair of particles .",
    "the qmrk approach @xcite is particularly appropriate for this kind of high - energy phenomenology .",
    "it is based on an effective quantum field theory implemented with the non - abelian gauge - invariant action including fields of reggeized gluons ( reggeons ) @xcite and reggeized quarks @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we apply the qmrk approach to various cross section distributions of @xmath0-jet hadroproduction . specifically , we study the transverse - momentum distribution of single @xmath0-jet production and , for @xmath3-dijet production , the distributions in the leading - jet transverse energy , the dijet invariant mass , and the azimuthal angle between the @xmath0 and @xmath11 jets .",
    "we compare our results with preliminary experimental data obtained by the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "we first study inclusive single @xmath0-jet production in @xmath12 collisions , working in the fixed - flavor - number scheme with @xmath13 active quark flavors . to leading order ( lo ) in the qmrk approach",
    ", there is only one partonic subprocess , namely @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the reggeized @xmath0 quark and gluon , respectively , and the four - momenta are labeled as indicated in the parentheses .",
    "as the modulus of the transverse momentum @xmath17 of the @xmath0 quark , @xmath18  gev @xcite , sufficiently exceeds its mass @xmath19 , it is justified to assume beauty to be an active flavor in the proton .",
    "the effective vertex mediating subprocess  ( [ equ : rq ] ) is given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the generators of the color gauge group su(@xmath22 ) with @xmath23 for qcd , @xmath24 is the color index of the reggeized gluon , @xmath25 , @xmath26 with @xmath27 in the cm frame and @xmath28 . in the following",
    ", we put @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the four - momenta of the incoming proton and antiproton , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 the transverse momenta of the reggeized @xmath0 quark and gluon , respectively .",
    "we then have @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the azimuthal angle enclosed between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "the contributions due to the other nlo processes , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are suppressed because , in the small-@xmath41 region , the parton distribution function ( pdf ) of the gluon greatly exceeds the relevant quark pdfs . using the effective feynman rules of the qmrk approach , the effective vertex mediating subprocess  ( [ equ : rrqq ] )",

    "the @xmath11 quark is contained in the remnant of the hadron that emits the reggeized @xmath0 quark and is thus well separated from the final - state @xmath0 quark detected in the central region of the detector . in order to avoid double counting , we therefore require for the @xmath11 quark of subprocess  ( [ equ : rrqq ] ) to satisfy @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , the cross section due to subprocess  ( [ equ : rrqq ] ) is negligibly small for @xmath96 , so that the precise value of this cut - off is irrelevant . in order to implement the isolation of the @xmath0 jet",

    "the qmrk results have to be taken with a grain of salt for @xmath103  gev , where the average values of the scaling variables @xmath104 and @xmath105 in the unintegrated pdfs exceed 0.1 , so that , strictly speaking , the qmrk approach ceases to be valid .",

    "we observe that the total qmrk predictions nicely describe all the three measured cross section distributions .",
    "the contributions due to subprocess  ( [ equ : rrqq ] ) dominate for @xmath115  gev and @xmath116  gev and over the whole @xmath85 range considered .",

    "[ fig:4 ] arises from the isolation cone condition .    the shaded bands in figs .",
    "[ fig:1][fig:4 ] only reflect the theoretical errors due to the uncertainties in the choices of the renormalization and factorization scales .",
    "additional and possibly larger errors arise from our lack of knowledge of the unintegrated pdfs , which are , however , hard to quantify at this point .",
    "we studied the inclusive hadroproduction of single @xmath0 jets and @xmath3 dijets at lo in the qmrk approach , including subprocesses  ( [ equ : rq ] ) , ( [ equ : rrqq ] ) , and ( [ eq : qqbb ] ) with reggeized partons in the initial state . despite the great simplicity of our formulas , our theoretical predictions turned out to describe recent measurements of various cross section distributions by the cdf colaboration in run  ii at the tevatron surprisingly well , without any ad - hoc adjustments of input parameters .",
    "by contrast , in the collinear parton model of qcd , such a degree of agreement can only be achieved by taking nlo corrections into account and performing soft - gluon resummation . in conclusion ,",
