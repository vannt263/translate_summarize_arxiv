    "the basic idea of secret sharing @xcite in a simple case is that a secret ( @xmath0 ) is divided by the sender alice into two pieces which will be distributed to two parties , bob and charlie , respectively , and they can reconstruct the secret if and only if both act in concert .",
    "each can get nothing about the message @xmath0 . as classical signal can be copied freely and fully without leaving a track , there is no way for people to complete the task unconditionally securely with classical physics in principle .",
    "when quantum mechanics enters the field of information , the case is changed .",
    "quantum secret sharing ( qss ) , an important branch of quantum communication , is the generalization of classical secret sharing into quantum scenario @xcite .",
    "there are three main goals in qss .",
    "the first one is used to distribute a private key among several parties , such as those in refs . @xcite ; the second is used for splitting a classical secret @xcite , and the third one can be used to share an unknown quantum state @xcite , which has to resort to quantum entanglement .",
    "certainly , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) provides a secure way for generating a private key between two remote parties and then can be used to complete the task for disturbing the key among several parties .",
    "the difference between qss and qkd @xcite is that the former can reduce the resource necessary to implement multi - party secret sharing tasks and is more convenient than that with qkd @xcite .",
    "a pioneering qss scheme was proposed by hillery , buek and berthiaume in 1999 by using three - particle and four - particle entangled greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states for sharing classical information , called hbb99 customarily for short . for sharing a quantum secret ,",
    "almost all of the existing qss protocols are either used to split a single qubit @xcite or resort to @xmath1-particle entanglements @xcite and @xmath1-particle joint measurements ( @xmath2 ) @xcite .",
    "the producing and measurement of @xmath1-particle entanglement both are not easy with present techniques @xcite .    from the view of security , sharing",
    "a quantum secret in qss is similar to quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) @xcite in which the secret message is transmitted directly without creating a private key and then encrypting the message as the quantum secret should not be leaked to the dishonest one .",
    "it is necessary for qss to set up a quantum channel securely in advance @xcite , which is same as qsdc in refs .",
    "@xcite . the way for sharing a sequence of two - particle maximally entangled states , einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs is discussed in refs @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will present a quantum state sharing ( which is abbreviated as _ qsts _ in ref.@xcite , different from qss for classical information ) scheme for sharing an arbitrary two - qubit state @xmath3 based on entanglement swapping @xcite with bell - state measurements and local unitary operations .",
    "it will be shown that the state @xmath4 can be split by two agents with four epr pairs shared in advance and four bell - state measurements , not @xmath1-particle joint measurements ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "any one in the two agents has the choice to reconstruct the original state @xmath4 with the help of the other s .",
    "moreover , we present a circular topological structure for splitting the state @xmath4 with epr pairs and bell - state measurements efficiently as it reduces the quantum resource largely when the number of the agents is large .",
    "almost all the epr pairs can be used for quantum communication in those two schemes , their efficiency for qubits approaches the maximal value , same as refs.@xcite .",
    "they are more convenient in application than the other schemes existing as they require only two - qubit entanglements and two - qubit joint measurements , not ghz states , for sharing an arbitrary two - qubit state .",
    "an epr pair is in one of the four bell states shown as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the two eigenvectors of two - level quantum system , such as the polarizations of photon along the z - direction , say @xmath8 .",
    "the four local unitary operations @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) can transform each one of the four bell states into another .",
    "@xmath11 for example , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the 2@xmath142 identity operator which means doing nothing on the particle .    the basic idea of this qsts scheme for splitting an entangled state @xmath15 based on entanglement swapping is shown in fig.1 .",
    "alice shares two epr photon pairs @xmath16 and @xmath17 with bob , and another two pairs @xmath18 and @xmath19 with charlie .",
