    "high - amplitude sub - larmor - scale electromagnetic turbulence is a phenomenon largely associated with high - energy density environments .",
    "such turbulence is a common feature of astrophysical and space plasmas , e.g. , at high - mach - number collisionless shocks in weakly magnetized plasmas @xcite , upstream regions of quasi - parallel shocks @xcite , sites of magnetic reconnection @xcite and others .",
    "additionally , these sub - larmor - scale , or `` small - scale '' , fields play a critical role in laboratory plasmas ; especially in high - intensity laser plasmas  as observed in facilities such as the national ignition facility ( nif ) , omegaep , hercules , trident , and others @xcite .",
    "experimental and numerical studies of non - relativistic collisionless shocks also show that they are mediated by small - scale electromagnetic turbulence @xcite .",
    "thus , studies of plasmas and turbulence in these environments are important for the fusion energy sciences and the inertial confinement concept @xcite .",
    "small - scale electromagnetic turbulence can be of various origin and thus have rather different properties , from being purely magnetic ( weibel ) turbulence @xcite , to various types of electromagnetic turbulence ( for example , whistler wave turbulence or turbulence produced by filamentation / mixed mode instability @xcite ) , to purely electrostatic langmuir turbulence @xcite .    despite substantial differences ,",
    "these small - scale fields share one thing in common : they vary on scales much smaller than the characteristic curvature scale of the particles traversing the field , i.e.  the plasma inertial length ( skin depth ) which are on the order of the particle larmor radius . the particle trajectory through these turbulent fields",
    "will , consequently , never form a well - defined larmor circle .    if the electromagnetic fields are random , which is usually the case of turbulence because of the random phases of fluctuations , the paths of the particles diffusively diverge due to pitch - angle diffusion .",
    "radiation simultaneously produced by these particles is neither cyclotron nor synchrotron ( for non - relativistic or relativistic particles , respectively ) but , instead , carries information about the spectrum of turbulent fluctuations . here",
    "we stress that we strictly consider the case of turbulence in vanishing mean field plasma @xmath0 .    in our previous work ,",
    "@xcite , we found the relation between the transport of relativistic particles in isotropic three - dimensional small - scale magnetic turbulence and the radiation spectra simultaneously produced by these particles .",
    "in particular , we found that the radiation spectrum agrees with the small - angle jitter radiation prediction , in the small deflection angle regime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrated that the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient is directly related to , and can readily be deduced from , the spectra of the emitted radiation .",
    "this inter - relation between radiative and transport properties provides a unique way to remotely diagnose high - energy - density plasmas , both in laboratory experiments and in astrophysical systems .",
    "we extend our previous work to now consider non - relativistic ( @xmath1 ) and trans - relativistic ( i.e.  mildly relativistic : @xmath2 ) particles moving through three - dimensional sub - larmor - scale magnetic turbulence .",
    "we demonstrate , once more via numerical and theoretical analysis , that an analogous inter - relation holds in these regimes as well , which naturally generalizes the relativistic small - angle jitter radiation regime and the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient .",
    "this trans - relativistic regime is applicable to laboratory plasmas , particularly high - intensity laser plasmas  where bulk plasma motion is below @xmath3 .",
    "multi - dimensional relativistic particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations and laboratory experiments have revealed that non - relativistic collisionless shocks , mediated by weibel - like instabilities , can occur in an overcritical plasma via interaction with an ultraintense laser pulse @xcite . in the laboratory setting ,",
    "laser - produced supersonic counter - streaming plasmas have been observed to give rise to self - organized electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "recently , the formation of filamentary structures indicative of weibel - like magnetic fields , fully consistent with the shock model offered by 3d pic simulations and theoretical instability analysis , has been directly observed in a scaled laboratory experiment @xcite .",
    "consequently , given the role of trans - relativistic particle motion in these environments , the study of the small - scale electromagnetic turbulence may be aided by the diagnostic tool offered via this inter - relation between the transport and radiative properties . the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ s : analytic ] presents the analytic theory .",
    "sections [ s : model ] and [ s : results ] describe the numerical techniques employed and the obtained simulation results .",
    "section [ s : concl ] is the conclusions .",
    "all equations appear in cgs units .",
    "consider a trans - relativistic electron moving ( with velocity , @xmath4 ) through a non - uniform , random , mean - free ( i.e.  @xmath0 ) , small - scale magnetic field ( and assume that this magnetic `` micro - turbulence '' is statistically homogeneous and isotropic ) . because the lorentz force on the electron is random , it s velocity and acceleration vectors vary stochastically , leading to a random ( diffusive ) trajectory .",
    "we define the field turbulence to be `` small - scale '' when the electron s larmor radius , @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the dimensionless particle velocity , @xmath7 is the electron mass , @xmath8 is the speed of light , @xmath9 is the electric charge , @xmath10 is the rms component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the electron s velocity vector , and @xmath11 is the electron s lorentz factor ) is greater than , or comparable to , the characteristic correlation scale of the magnetic field , @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 .    for small deflections ,",
    "the deflection angle of the velocity ( with respect to the particle s initial direction of motion ) is approximately the ratio of the change in the electron s transverse momentum to its initial transverse momentum .",
    "the former is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the transverse lorentz force , and @xmath16 is the transit time , which is the time required to traverse the scale of the field s inhomogeneity , i.e. , the field correlation length , @xmath12 .",
    "this is , @xmath17  where @xmath18 is the the component of the velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the change in the transverse momentum is thus , @xmath19 . given that the particle s total transverse momentum is @xmath20 , the deflection angle over the field correlation length will be @xmath21 .",
    "the subsequent deflection will be in a random direction , because the field is uncorrelated over scales greater than @xmath12 , hence the particle motion is diffusive . as for any diffusive process ,",
    "the ensemble - averaged squared deviation grows linearly with time .",
    "hence , for the pitch - angle deviation , we have @xmath22 the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient is , by definition , the ratio of the square of the deflection angle in a coherent patch to the transit time over this patch , that is @xmath23 where a volume - averaged square magnetic field , @xmath24 and perpendicular rms velocity , @xmath25 have been substituted for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "note that the diffusion coefficient depends on both statistical properties of the magnetic field , namely its strength and the typical correlation scale .",
    "although the assumption that @xmath28 is valid in the ultra - relativistic limit : @xmath29 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is not evident that it holds for trans - relativistic and non - relativistic velocities . as we will demonstrate via numerical simulation",
    ", pitch - angle diffusion will occur in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ daa ] ) , so long as the magnetic turbulence is sub - larmor - scale , i.e.  @xmath30 .    the average square magnetic field",
    ", @xmath24 is related to @xmath31 by a multiplicative factor .",
    "for isotropic magnetic turbulence , @xmath32 .",
    "thus , @xmath33 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath34 may be expressed as a linear combination of parallel and perpendicular components .",
    "given isotropy , @xmath35 , so @xmath36 recognizing that @xmath37 allows the expression of the rms perpendicular velocity as @xmath38 next , the correlation length , @xmath12 lacks a formal definition .",
    "it is , nonetheless , commonplace in the literature ",
    "e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite , to define the two - point autocorrelation tensor , @xmath39 with the formally path and time dependent correlation length tensor defined as @xmath40 note that we make no distinction between co - variant and contra - variant components ; the usage of upper and lower indices is only for convenience .    since the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the particle trajectory alters the motion , we choose an integration path along @xmath41 and only consider a transverse magnetic field component . in accord with standard practice ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we choose @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "thus , we define the magnetic field correlation length as @xmath44 the correlation length has a convenient representation in fourier `` @xmath45-space '' and  @xmath46-space \" . let @xmath47 be the spatial and temporal fourier transform of the magnetic field , i.e.@xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath46 are the corresponding wave vector and frequency , respectively .",
    "we may define a complementary spectral correlation tensor @xmath50 , such that @xmath51 isotropy , homogeneity , time - independence , and @xmath52 require that the spectral correlation tensor take the simple form @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the volume of the space considered , @xmath55 is the unit vector in the direction of the wave vector , and @xmath56 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the normalization has been chosen such that @xmath57 .",
    "( [ corr_tensor_def_phi ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ spec_tensor ] ) , the correlation length may be reformulated as @xmath58 by assuming isotropic turbulence , the magnetic field has azimuthal and polar symmetry in @xmath45-space , hence @xmath59 is only a function of @xmath60 . after the integration over @xmath61 and all solid - angles in fourier space , eq .",
    "( [ corr_l ] ) becomes @xmath62 it may be noted that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the characteristic ( dominant ) wave number of turbulence .",

    "( [ daa ] ) , ( [ beta_para ] ) , and ( [ corr_l_div ] ) , the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient is @xmath65 to continue , we must specify a magnetic spectral distribution , @xmath66 .",
    "as in our previous work ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we assume the isotropic three - dimensional magnetic turbulence has a static , i.e.  time - independent , power law turbulent spectrum : @xmath67 here the magnetic spectral index , @xmath68 is a real number , and @xmath69 is a normalization , such that @xmath70 it should be noted that our principal results strictly apply only to static turbulence .",
    "one should , in principle , consider time - dependent fields as well .",
    "however , if the transit time of a particle over a correlation length is shorter than the field variability time - scale , then the static field approximation is valid . additionally , plasma instabilities generally produce random fields in a preferred direction , leading to anisotropic turbulence",
    "nonetheless , isotropy may arise in an advance stage of development .",
    "magnetic turbulence of this kind is a natural outcome of the non - linear weibel - filamentation instability , which occurs at relativistic collisionless shocks and in laser - produced plasmas @xcite .",
    "now we consider the radiative properties of these sub - larmor - scale plasmas .",
    "first , the ultra - relativistic radiation regime in sub - larmor - scale magnetic turbulence is well understood .",
    "this regime is characterized by a single parameter , the ratio of the deflection angle , @xmath71 to the relativistic beaming angle , @xmath72 .",
    "the ratio @xcite @xmath73 is known as the @xmath74 . from this , we recover four distinct radiation regimes .",
    "firstly , if @xmath75 , the regime is the classical synchrotron radiation regime ; the particle orbits are circular in the plane orthogonal to a perfectly homogeneous magnetic field . with @xmath76 , the regime is very similar to synchrotron , but the particle s guiding center is slowly drifting , due to slight inhomogeneity in the magnetic field .",
    "the produced spectrum is well represented by the synchrotron spectrum , and it evolves slowly in time due to the particle diffusion through regions of differing field strength .",
    "this regime may be referred to as the diffusive synchrotron regime .",
    "thirdly , when @xmath77 , the particle does not complete its larmor orbit because the @xmath78-field varies on a shorter scale . in this case , an onlooking observer would see radiation from only short intervals of the particle s trajectory ( i.e. , whenever the trajectory is near the line - of - sight ) , as in synchrotron , but these intervals are randomly distributed .",
    "this is the case of the large - angle jitter regime .",
    "the radiation is similar to synchrotron radiation near the spectral peak and above , but differs significantly from it at lower frequencies , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .    finally , if @xmath79 , a distant observer on the line - of - sight will see the radiation along , virtually , the entire trajectory of the particle ( which will be approximately straight with small , random , transverse deviations ) .",
    "this is known as small - angle jitter radiation @xcite .",
    "the resulting radiation markedly differs from synchrotron radiation , although the total radiated power of radiation , @xmath80 , produced by a particle in all these regimes , e.g. , jitter and synchrotron , is identical : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the classical electron radius .",
    "for ultra - relativistic electrons , the radiation spectra are wholly determined by @xmath83 and the magnetic spectral distribution .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that monoenergetic relativistic electrons in the sub - larmor - scale magnetic turbulence given by eq .",
    "( [ bk ] ) produce a flat angle - averaged spectrum below the spectral break and a power - law spectrum above the break , that is @xmath84 where the spectral break is @xmath85 which is called the jitter frequency .",
    "similarly , the high - frequency break is @xmath86      in contrast , radiation from non - relativistic particles is not beamed along a narrow cone of opening angle , @xmath87 .",
    "the jitter parameter is , consequently , without meaning in the non - relativistic radiation regime . instead , the `` dimensionless scale '' ( or `` gyro - number '' ) , i.e.  @xmath88 , is the only meaningful parameter : @xmath89 given the magnetic spectral distribution exhibited by eq .",
    "( [ bk ] ) , @xmath90 , so @xmath91 as we shall see below , the radiation spectrum in this regime markedly differs from the single - harmonic cyclotron spectrum .",
    "we call this radiation `` pseudo - cyclotron '' radiation or `` non - relativistic jitter '' radiation",
    ".    regardless of the regime , the radiation spectrum ( which is the radiative spectral energy , @xmath92 per unit frequency , @xmath93 , and per unit solid - angle , @xmath94 ) seen by a distant observer is obtained from the equation @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96}{(1 - \\hat{\\bf n}\\cdot{\\boldsymbol\\beta})^2}e^{-i{\\bf k}\\cdot { \\bf r}(t)}. \\label{a_k}\\ ] ] in this equation , @xmath97 is the particle s position at the retarded time @xmath98 , @xmath99 is the wave vector which points along @xmath100 from @xmath97 to the observer and @xmath101 . since the observer is distant , @xmath100 is approximated as fixed in time to the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "this fully relativistic equation is obtained from the linard - wiechart potentials . if @xmath102 , eq .",
    "( [ lw ] ) simplifies to @xmath103 next , integrating eq .",
    "( [ lw_nonrel ] ) over all solid - angles gives the radiated energy per frequency @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the fourier component of the electron s acceleration with frequency , @xmath106 .",
    "( [ dwdw ] ) , valid for @xmath102 , is known as the dipole approximation @xcite .",
    "this expression may also be obtained from the larmor formula , i.e.@xmath107 using the identity @xcite : @xmath108 to proceed further , we use our previous assumption that the particle deflection angle over a field correlation length is small ( i.e.  @xmath28 ) .",
    "this condition implies the validity of the `` perturbative '' approach , whereby the particle trajectory is approximated as a straight line . for a particle moving in a magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath109 is given by the lorentz force . in this limiting case of small deflections , we may write @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the temporal variation of the magnetic field along the trajectory of the electron , i.e.@xmath112 since the trajectory is approximately straight , @xmath113 , consequently @xmath114 after the time integration , this becomes @xmath115 now , since the magnetic turbulence is assumed to be homogeneous ( at least over a time scale greater than the particle transit time ) the product of @xmath116 along a particular trajectory starting at @xmath117 is representative of the magnetic field as a whole @xcite .",
    "thus , we may consider only the volume - average of @xmath116 . performing the integration leads to @xmath118 the quantity ,",

    "it is a noteworthy observation that the preceding results are identical , up to overall multiplicative factors , to the radiation spectra and pitch - angle diffusion coefficient for the more physically plausible situation of a trans - relativistic monopole moving through `` small - scale '' electrostatic turbulence , such as langmuir turbulence .",
    "in this paper we explored non - relativistic and trans - relativistic particle transport ( diffusion ) and radiation production in small - scale electromagnetic turbulence .",
    "principally , we demonstrated that in the regime of small deflections , i.e.  when the particle s deflection angle over a correlation length is small @xmath28 , the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient and the simultaneously produced radiation spectrum are wholly determined by the particle velocity and the statistical / spectral properties of the magnetic turbulence ; which is a result most transparently offered by eqs .",

    "in fact , the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient remains unchanged , in both the non - relativistic and relativistic regimes .",

    "we have , further , confirmed our theoretical results via first - principle numerical simulations .",
    "lastly , we have considered the change in the radiative and transport properties of trans - relativistic particles moving through magnetic turbulence due to a topological change in the field .",
    "namely , we supposed the generation of sub - larmor - scale magnetic turbulence from a distribution of magnetic monopoles .",
    "we showed that the radiation spectra and pitch - angle diffusion coefficient are modified ; i.e.  the pitch - angle diffusion coefficient doubles in magnitude , _  la _ eq .",

    "these results , furthermore , generalize to the case of a magnetic monopole moving through  small - scale \" electrostatic turbulence .    finally , the applicability of our model will depend heavily upon the plasma environment .",
    "the turbulence dissipation time - scale , growth rate , time - evolution , and spatial - scale are important considerations .",
    "we have highlighted the weibel - like turbulence , in particular , because of its favorable properties .",
    "as stated previously , the weibel instability can produce strong , small - scale , magnetic fields in an non - magnetized plasma .",
    "furthermore , the instability is aperiodic ( i.e.  real frequency @xmath244 ) , and thus allows for the static field treatment .",
    "more precisely , the growth rate @xmath245 . typically , the growth rate is governed by a characteristic plasma frequency .",
    "lastly , the magnetic fluctuations are long - lived in the case of the weibel - filamentation instability , dying out only when the driving free energy ( provided by the kinetic energy of streaming particle filaments ) of the system is converted by particle isotropization ( i.e.  the depletion of the anisotropy in the streaming particle distribution function ) . in short ,",
    "the generated fields are approximately stationary on a time - scale which exceeds the growth / stabilization rate times @xcite .",
    "consequently , there appears to be adequate time for radiation production in the jitter regime , given by our prescription , in these `` quasi - static '' weibel magnetic fields .    via subsequent non - linear evolution",
    ", the electron - generated weibel magnetic fields may grow to larger spatial - scales  including the ion skin - depth . additionally ,",
    "the weibel fields may `` seed '' the growth of further mhd turbulence via a process of inverse - cascade  once more , residing at larger spatial - scales . thus , in the non - relativistic regime , the jitter radiation spectrum may be effectively screened out when the turbulent magnetic fields predominantly exist at scales much larger than the electron skin - depth . consequently , non - relativistic jitter radiation , as a diagnostic of weibel turbulence , may have a limited applicability .",
    "however , kinetic instabilities in magnetized plasma can produce turbulent magnetic spectra at the appropriate length scales as well .",
    "one such scenario may be provided by a turbulent magnetic field generated in a cold , magnetized , background plasma .",
    "we then imagine the existence of a `` hot '' population of sub - larmor - scale electrons that will serve as our test particles . to this end",
    ", anisotropic whistler turbulence may provide a promising candidate .",

    "naturally , our model requires modification to suit a magnetized plasma  the case to be considered elsewhere .    to conclude , the obtained results , coupled with our previous work , reveal strong inter - relation of transport and radiative properties of plasmas turbulent at sub - larmor scales  whether they be relativistic or non - relativistic .",

    "this feature is , in fact , a numerical artifact that is magnified by the use of a log - log plot .",
    "here we have plotted figure [ kmin_spec ] on a linear scale , and have normalized the frequency axis by the spectral break frequency @xmath247 .",
    "one might consider the importance of using a divergenceless set of interpolants for the magnetic field . in figure [ interp_spec ]",
    ", we show a spectrum obtained via the divergenceless radial - basis interpolants of eq .",
    "( [ rad_basis ] ) with a spectrum obtained using a simple , non - divergenceless , trilinear interpolation of the magnetic field . for small frequencies ,",
    "there is little disagreement between the two spectra .",

    "@xcite ) , little deviation in these spectra was observed in our test runs .",
    "one possible explanation is that , since the particle velocities were @xmath249 , the total distance traveled by a particle in one time step was @xmath250 .",
    "the spacing between lattice points is , typically , within an order of @xmath251 . in this case",
    ", the interpolant should not play an important role in determining the particle trajectories .",
    "if , however , @xmath217 is much less than @xmath8 , then the difference may be significant . in figure [ interp_spec ] , @xmath225 , thus @xmath252 ( an order of magnitude smaller ) . in this case",
    ", frequencies in the radiation spectrum at scales comparable to the grid resolution ( i.e.  large @xmath253 s ) will suffer the most from this deviation .",
    "another question worth addressing is the influence of the discrete implementation of the magnetic field on the spectral shape .",
    "recall that the random magnetic field is initially generated on a lattice in @xmath45-space , after which it is subsequently transformed by fft to real space .",
    "the interpolation is then applied on the lattice of points .",
    "due to memory limitations , the lattice dimensions are limited to @xmath254 ; this can be a very severe limitation on the spatial resolution of the magnetic field .",
    "an alternative generation of the magnetic field  which is grid - less and , therefore , not requiring interpolation  employs a large sum of sinusoidal wave modes which are evaluated at each time step ( as needed ) .",
    "thus , the magnetic field is effectively `` continuous '' in this representation . each wave mode is constructed with a random phase and random polarization vector ( which is constrained to the plane perpendicular to @xmath49 ; thus satisfying gauss s law )",
    ". the polarization vector may be generated by a variety of methods , but we have chosen the implementation described by ref .",
    "this representation of the polarization vectors is designed specifically to simultaneously satisfy the required properties of isotropic , homogeneous , and divergence - free magnetic turbulence . additionally , the wave numbers , ranging from @xmath199 to @xmath213 , are logarithmically spaced .    in figure",
    "[ interp_spec ] , we also included a radiation spectrum obtained by electrons moving in the `` continuous '' magnetic field ( with , otherwise , identical properties ) . evidently , the `` continuous '' field derived spectrum closely matches the analytical solution , eq .",

    "<S> plasmas with electromagnetic fields turbulent at sub - larmor - scales are a feature of a wide variety of high - energy - density environments , and are essential to the description of many astrophysical / laboratory plasma phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> radiation from particles , whether they be relativistic or non - relativistic , moving through small - scale magnetic turbulence has spectral characteristics distinct from both synchrotron and cyclotron radiation . the radiation , carrying information on the statistical properties of the magnetic turbulence , is also intimately related to the particle diffusive transport . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated , both theoretically and numerically , the transport of non - relativistic and trans - relativistic particles in plasmas with high - amplitude isotropic sub - larmor - scale magnetic turbulence , and its relation to the spectra of radiation simultaneously produced by these particles . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the diffusive and radiative properties of plasmas turbulent on sub - larmor scales may serve as a powerful tool to diagnosis laboratory and astrophysical plasmas . </S>"
