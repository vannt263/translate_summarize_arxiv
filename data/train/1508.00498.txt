    "the probability measure @xmath4 considered in this paper is a uniform distribution which is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure @xmath15 , and so there exists a probability density function @xmath16 , known as radon - nikokym derivative of @xmath4 with respect to @xmath15 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that for any borel subset @xmath19 , we have @xmath20 given a finite subset @xmath21 , the voronoi region generated by @xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 i.e. , the voronoi region generated by @xmath22 is the set of all points in @xmath5 which are closest to @xmath24 , and the set @xmath25 is called the voronoi diagram or voronoi tessellation of @xmath14 .",

    "we have considered a uniform distribution on an equilateral triangle , and investigated the optimal sets of @xmath0-means and the @xmath0th quantization error for this distribution for all @xmath12 . moreover , in theorem  [ th2 ] , we have shown that the voronoi regions generated by the two points in an optimal set of 2-means partition the equilateral triangle into an isosceles trapezoid and an equilateral triangle in the golden ratio . in subsequent sections , we find the optimal sets of 3-means and 4-means . in the last section , we have given some numerical optimization results and conjectures about the optimal configurations for @xmath0 points , a rigorous bound on the quantization error for @xmath3 ( thm .",
