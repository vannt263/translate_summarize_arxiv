    "lisa , the laser interferometer space antenna , is a three - spacecraft deep space mission , jointly proposed to the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) and the european space agency ( esa ) .",
    "the lisa scientific objective is to detect and study low - frequency cosmic gravitational radiation by observing phase differences of laser beams interchanged between drag - free spacecraft @xcite .",
    "modeling each spacecraft with two optical benches , carrying independent lasers , frequency generators ( called ultra stable oscillators ) , beam splitters and photo receivers , the measured eighteen time series of frequency shifts ( six obtained from the six one - way laser beams between spacecraft pairs , six from the beams between the two optical benches on each of the three spacecraft , and six more from modulation of the laser beams with uso data ) were previously analyzed by tinto _",
    "there it was shown that there exist several combinations of these eighteen observables which exactly cancel the otherwise overwhelming phase noise of the lasers , the phase fluctuations due to the non - inertial motions of the six optical benches , and the phase fluctuations introduced by the three ultra stable oscillators into the heterodyned measurements , while leaving effects due to passing gravitational waves .",
    "the analysis presented in @xcite relied on the assumptions that ( i ) the frequency offsets of any pair of independent lasers ( assumed there to be @xmath2 ) could be observed within the detection bandwidths of the photo receivers where the one - way doppler measurements are performed , and ( ii ) the telemetry data rate needed by two of the three spacecraft to transmit their measured one - way doppler data to the third spacecraft ( where the interferometric combinations are synthesized ) is adequate .",
    "although the technology lisa will be able to use should make possible the implementation of time - delay interferometry ( tdi ) as discussed in @xcite , the possibility of optimizing the design of the optical layout , while at the same time minimizing the number of doppler data needed for constructing the entire space of interferometric observables , was not analyzed there .",
    "here we extend those results to a different optical configuration , in which one of the six lasers is the provider of the frequency reference ( albeit time - delayed ) for the other five via phase - locking .",
    "master - slave _ optical design could provide potential advantages , such as smaller frequency offsets between beams from pairs of different lasers , hardware redundancy , reliability , and can result in a smaller number of measured data .",
    "an outline of the paper is given below .",
    "in section ii we summarize tdi , the data processing technique needed for removing the frequency fluctuations of the six lasers used by lisa , and other noises . in order to show that the entire space of interferometric observables lisa can generate",
    "can also be reconstructed by using a master - slave optical configuration , we consider the simple case of spacecraft that are stationary with respect to each other . after showing that the entire space of interferometric observables can be obtained by properly combining four generators , ( @xmath3 ) , we then derive the expressions for the four generators corresponding to the master - slave optical configuration . by imposing some of the one - way measurements entering into ( @xmath3 ) to be zero ( the so called _ locking conditions _ )",
    ", we show that the expressions for these generators can be written in terms of the one - way and two - way doppler measurements corresponding to the locking configuration we analyzed .",
    "section iii and appendix a provide a theoretical derivation and estimation of the magnitude of the phase noise expected to be generated by an optical transponder . in section",
    "iv we analyze and compare the hardware requirements needed for implementing both optical designs , while in section v we turn to the estimation of the armlength and time synchronization accuracies , as well as time - shift and sampling time precisions needed for successfully implementing tdi with lisa .",
    "our comments and conclusions are finally presented in section vi .",
    "the description of tdi for lisa is greatly simplified if we adopt the notation shown in figure 1 , where the overall geometry of the lisa detector is defined .",
    "the spacecraft are labeled @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and distances between pairs of spacecraft are @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being opposite spacecraft @xmath11 .",
    "unit vectors between spacecraft are @xmath12 , oriented as indicated in figure 1 .",
    "we similarly index the phase difference data to be analyzed : @xmath13 is the phase difference time series measured at reception at spacecraft 1 with transmission from spacecraft 2 ( along @xmath9 ) .",
    "similarly , @xmath14 is the phase difference series derived from reception at spacecraft @xmath4 with transmission from spacecraft @xmath6 .",
    "the other four one - way phase difference time series from signals exchanged between the spacecraft are obtained by cyclic permutation of the indices : @xmath4 @xmath15 @xmath5 @xmath15 @xmath6 @xmath15 @xmath4 .",
    "we also adopt a useful notation for delayed data streams : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , etc .",
    "( we take the speed of light @xmath18 for the analysis ) .",
    "six more phase difference series result from laser beams exchanged between adjacent optical benches within each spacecraft ; these are similarly indexed as @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .    the proof - mass - plus - optical - bench assemblies for lisa spacecraft number @xmath4 are shown schematically in figure 2 .",
    "we take the left - hand optical bench to be bench number @xmath4 , while the right - hand bench is @xmath21 .",
    "the photo receivers that generate the data @xmath14 , @xmath13 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 at spacecraft @xmath4 are shown .",
    "the phase fluctuations of the laser on optical bench @xmath4 is @xmath24 ; on optical bench @xmath21 it is @xmath25 and these are independent ( the lasers are for the moment not `` locked '' to each other , and both are referenced to their own independent frequency stabilizing device ) .",
    "we extend the cyclic terminology so that at vertex @xmath11 ( @xmath26 ) the random displacement vectors of the two proof masses are respectively denoted @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the random displacements ( perhaps several orders of magnitude greater ) of their optical benches are correspondingly denoted @xmath29 and @xmath30 . as pointed out in @xcite , the analysis does assume that pairs of optical benches are rigidly connected , i.e. @xmath31 , in general .",
    "the present lisa design shows optical fibers transmitting signals both ways between adjacent benches .",
    "we ignore time - delay effects for these signals and will simply denote by @xmath32 the phase fluctuations upon transmission through the fibers of the laser beams with frequencies @xmath33 , and @xmath34",
    ". the @xmath35 phase shifts within a given spacecraft might not be the same for large frequency differences @xmath36 .",
    "for the envisioned frequency differences ( a few hundred megahertz ) , however , the remaining fluctuations due to the optical fiber can be neglected @xcite .",
    "it is also assumed that the phase noise added by the fibers is independent of the direction of light propagation through them .",
    "figure 2 endeavors to make the detailed light paths for these observations clear .",
    "an outgoing light beam transmitted to a distant spacecraft is routed from the laser on the local optical bench using mirrors and beam splitters ; this beam does not interact with the local proof mass .",
    "conversely , an _ incoming _ light beam from a distant spacecraft is bounced off the local proof mass before being reflected onto the photo receiver where it is mixed with light from the laser on that same optical bench .",
    "the inter - spacecraft phase data are denoted @xmath13 and @xmath14 in figure 2 .",
    ", reads out the phase signals @xmath13 and @xmath23 . the right hand bench , @xmath21 , analogously reads out @xmath14 and @xmath22 .",
    "the random displacements of the two proof masses and two optical benches are indicated ( lower case @xmath37 for the proof masses , upper case @xmath38 for the optical benches.),width=6 ]    beams between adjacent optical benches within a single spacecraft are bounced off proof masses in the opposite way .",
    "light to be _ transmitted _ from the laser on an optical bench is _ first _ bounced off the proof mass it encloses and then directed to the other optical bench . upon reception",
    "it does _ not _ interact with the proof mass there , but is directly mixed with local laser light , and again down converted .",
    "these data are denoted @xmath23 and @xmath22 in figure 2 .",
    "the terms in the following equations for the @xmath39 and @xmath19 phase measurements can now be developed from figures 1 and 2 , and they are for the particular lisa configuration in which all the lasers have the same nominal frequency @xmath40 , and the spacecraft are stationary with respect to each other . the analysis covering the configuration with lasers of different frequencies and spacecraft moving relative to each other was done in @xcite , and we refer the reader to that paper .",
    "consider the @xmath41 process ( equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) ) below .",
    "the photo receiver on the left bench of spacecraft @xmath4 , which ( in the spacecraft frame ) experiences a time - varying displacement @xmath42 , measures the phase difference @xmath13 by first mixing the beam from the distant optical bench @xmath43 in direction @xmath44 , and laser phase noise @xmath45 and optical bench motion @xmath46 that have been delayed by propagation along @xmath9 , after one bounce off the proof mass ( @xmath47 ) , with the local laser light ( with phase noise @xmath48 ) . since for this simplified configuration no frequency offsets are present , there is of course no need for any heterodyne conversion .    in equation ( [ eq:4 ] )",
    "the @xmath23 measurement results from light originating at the right - bench laser ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) , bounced once off the right proof mass ( @xmath51 ) , and directed through the fiber ( incurring phase shift @xmath52 ) , to the left bench , where it is mixed with laser light ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "similarly the right bench records the phase differences @xmath14 and @xmath22 .",

    "the gravitational wave phase signal components , @xmath54 , in equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) are given by integrating with respect to time the equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) of reference @xcite that relate metric perturbations to frequency shifts .",
    "the optical path phase noise contributions , @xmath55 , which includes shot noise from the low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) in the links between the distant spacecraft , can be derived from the corresponding term given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 measurements will be made with high snr so that for them the shot noise is negligible .",
    "the laser - noise - free combinations of phase data can readily be obtained from those given in @xcite for frequency data .",
    "we use the same notations : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , etc . , but the reader should keep in mind that here these are phase measurements .",
    "the phase fluctuations , @xmath63 , are the fundamental measurements needed to synthesize all the interferometric observables unaffected by laser and optical bench noises .",
    "if we assume for the moment these phase measurements to be continuous functions of time , the three armlengths to be perfectly known and constant , and the three clocks onboard the spacecraft to be perfectly synchronized , then it is possible to cancel out exactly the phase fluctuations due to the six lasers and six optical benches by properly time - shifting and linearly combining the twelve measurements @xmath63 . the simplest such combination , the totally symmetrized sagnac response @xmath62 , uses all the data of figure 2 symmetrically @xmath64 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { 1 \\over 2 }   [ ( { \\tau_{23 } } - { \\tau_{13}})_{,3 } + ( { \\tau_{31 } } - { \\tau_{21}})_{,1 } + ( { \\tau_{12 } } - { \\tau_{32}})_{,2 } ] , \\label{eq:5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and its transfer functions to instrumental noises and gravitational waves are given in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "in particular , @xmath62 has a `` six - pulse response '' to gravitational radiation , i.e. a @xmath65-function gravitational wave signal produces six distinct pulses in @xmath62 @xcite , which are located with relative times depending on the arrival direction of the wave and the detector configuration .",
    "together with @xmath62 , three more interferometric combinations , ( @xmath66 ) , jointly generate the entire space of interferometric combinations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "their expressions in terms of the measurements @xmath39 , @xmath19 are as follows @xmath67 \\ , \\label{eq:6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 , and @xmath61 derived by permuting the spacecraft indices in @xmath59 . like in the case of @xmath62 ,",
    "a @xmath65-function gravitational wave produces six pulses in @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 . in equations ( [ eq:5 ] , [ eq:6 ] )",
    "it is important to notice that the @xmath19 measurements from each spacecraft always enter into the interferometric measurements as differences taken at the same time .",
    "this property naturally suggests a locking configuration that makes these differences equal to zero , as we will show in the next section .",
    "we remind the reader that the four interferometric responses ( @xmath68 ) satisfy the following relationship @xmath69 jointly they also give the expressions of the interferometric combinations derived in @xcite , @xcite : the unequal - arm michelson ( @xmath70 ) , the beacon ( @xmath71 ) , the monitor ( @xmath72 ) , and the relay ( @xmath73 ) responses @xmath74 with the remaining expressions obtained from equations ( [ eq:8 ] , [ eq:9 ] , [ eq:10 ] , [ eq:11 ] ) by permutation of the spacecraft indices .",
    "all these interferometric combinations have been shown to add robustness to the mission with respect to failures of subsystems , and potential design , implementation , or cost advantages @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the space of all possible interferometric combinations can be generated by properly time shifting and linearly combining the four combinations ( @xmath3 ) , as given above .",
    "although they have been derived by applying tdi to the twelve one - way doppler data , in what follows we will show that they can also be written in terms of properly selected and time shifted two - way and one - way doppler measurements .",
    "these can be generated by phase locking five of the six lasers to one of them , as it is described below .",
    "assume , without loss of generality , the laser on bench @xmath21 to be the master .",
    "although there are several other possible locking schemes , the one chosen minimizes the number of locking conditions between the master and any given slave .",
    "furthermore , locking schemes relying on more than one master could be implemented , but we will not address those in this paper",
    ". we will also assume the spacecraft to be stationary relative to each other .",
    "this assumption simplifies the analysis , and does not affect the validity of the general result @xcite .        under this assumption , the frequency provided by the master laser @xmath21 can be used as input reference for the slaved lasers . in other words",
    "the slaves will then have the same center frequency as the master , and their phase fluctuations will be related to the fluctuations of the master laser as well as any other fluctuations introduced into the received light beam prior to reception and locking .    in order to understand the topology of the beams as the various slaves are locked to the master ,",
    "let us follow the light paths from the master laser , @xmath21 , to the slaves , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "let us start first with the light beam that is bounced off the back of the proof - mass @xmath21 .",
    "this beam is then directed to the other bench , @xmath4 , where it is used as the input frequency reference for the laser there , and the measurement @xmath23 is made .",
    "light is then re - transmitted back to bench @xmath21 where the measurement @xmath22 is performed . since the phase of the laser @xmath4 is locked to that of the master , the relative phase fluctuations @xmath23 can be adjusted as follows @xmath75 where we have assumed the noise introduced by phase - locking to be negligible ( on this point see the theoretical derivations in section iii and appendix a ) .",
    "similarly , light beams from lasers @xmath4 and @xmath21 are transmitted to the lasers on the benches @xmath43 and @xmath6 respectively , where the lasers are locked to the incoming beams . from benches",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath6 beams are transmitted to the lasers on benches @xmath5 and @xmath76 respectively , where again locking is performed similarly to what is done onboard spacecraft @xmath4 .",
    "finally , along arm @xmath4 , only two one - way relative phase measurements can be performed as it is easy to see . since for the moment we have assumed a configuration with stationary spacecraft , the optical configuration described above can be translated into the following _ locking conditions _ on some relative phase fluctuation measurements @xmath77 the locking conditions define specific relationships among the phase fluctuations from various noise sources . as an example , the conditions @xmath78 imply the following relationships among the laser phase fluctuations , the proof - mass noises , the gravitational wave signal , and the two bench noises onboard spacecraft @xmath4 @xmath79 \\ , \\label{eq:13d}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with similar expressions following from the other locking conditions given in equation ( [ eq:13b ] ) .",
    "if we now substitute the locking conditions into the expressions for ( @xmath3 ) , we obtain their expressions in terms of the remaining measurements @xmath80 where the data ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) are one - way , and ( @xmath14 , @xmath13 ) are effectively two - way doppler measurements due to locking .",
    "the verification that the combinations ( @xmath83 ) exactly cancel the laser phase fluctuations as well as the fluctuations due to the mechanical vibrations of the optical benches , can be performed by substituting the locked phase processes ( such as [ eq:13c ] , [ eq:13d ] ) into the expressions for ( @xmath84 ) ( which are given by equations ( [ eq:1 ] , [ eq:3 ] ) and their permutations ) , and by further replacing them into equations ( [ eq:14 ] - [ eq:17 ] ) .",
    "the main result of implementing locking is quantitatively shown by equations ( [ eq:14 ] - [ eq:17 ] ) in that the number of measurements needed for constructing the entire space of interferometric combinations lisa will be able to generate is smaller by a factor of three than the number of measurements needed when only one - way data are used .",
    "once ( @xmath85 ) are constructed according to the expressions given in equations ( [ eq:14 ] - [ eq:17 ] ) , all the other interferometric combinations can be derived by applying the identities given in equations ( [ eq:8 ] - [ eq:11 ] ) . as an example , it is straightforward to show that equation ( [ eq:8 ] ) implies the following expression for the unequal - arm michelson combination @xmath86 @xmath87 - [ s_{21,33 } - s_{31,22 } ] \\ ,   \\label{eq:18}\\ ] ] which coincides with the expression for @xmath56 , derived for the first time in @xcite , in terms of the two - way doppler measurements from the two lisa arms .    as a final comment ,",
    "we have analyzed also several locking configurations needed when the spacecraft are moving relative to each other .",
    "we have found that there exist techniques , when locking is implemented , which are similar to the one analyzed in @xcite for removing the noise of the onboard ultra stable oscillators from the phase measurements .",
    "the conclusions derived above for the case of stationary spacecraft are therefore general , and an analysis covering locking configurations with moving spacecraft is available in @xcite .",
    "the locking conditions given in equation ( [ eq:13b ] ) reflect the assumption that the noise due to the optical transponders is negligible . in this section",
    "we analyze the noise added by the process of locking the phase of the local laser to the phase of the received light .",
    "this noise will be in addition to the optical path and uso noises , which we consider separately .    a block diagram of the phase locking control system is shown in figure [ servo](a ) .",
    "the system consists of a photoreceiver , phasemeter , controller , actuator and laser ( see section iv for a description of these subsystems ) .",
    "each of these subsystems can be characterized by its transfer function and , when it applies , by a noise contribution @xcite .",
    "the main inputs to the system are the phase noise of the local laser , @xmath88 , and the phase fluctuations of the signal beam from the distant spacecraft , @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 being the laplace variable ) .",
    "the closed loop output is the phase noise of the retransmitted laser beam , @xmath91 .        from the block diagram shown in figure 4a ,",
    "it is easy to see that the closed loop output phase @xmath91 can be written in terms of the free - running laser phase noise , @xmath88 , the input signal phase fluctuations , @xmath89 , and the various feedback components transfer functions and noises shown in figure 4 , as follows @xmath92 \\right\\ } \\ .\\ ] ] this equation can be solved for @xmath93 @xmath94 \\right\\ } } \\over   { 1+l \\ a \\",
    "r } } \\ , \\label{eq:18bis}\\ ] ] where we have denoted with @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 the noises due to the photoreceiver , phasemeter , and actuator respectively .",
    "the detection noise , @xmath98 is the error in the measurement of the relative phase of the two beams .",
    "this noise is the fundamental limit to the phase measurement process for the lisa detection system ( see appendix a ) .",
    "since the link from the phasemeter to the controller will be digital , the controller noise will be due only to the finite precision of the digital phase information .",
    "we thus assume this noise to be negligible and do not include it in this analysis .    since ( i ) the product @xmath99 ( the phase at the phasemeter output ought to be equal to the phase at the input point of the photoreceiver ) , ( ii ) the contribution of the actuator noise to the output , @xmath100 , is much smaller than the noise from the free - running laser ( the free running laser noise is measured with the actuators attached and thus intrinsically contains this noise source ) , and ( iii ) the laser transfer function , @xmath101 , is a passive low pass filter with a pole at several ghz ( and",
    "so can be ignored in this discussion ) , we conclude that the block diagram in [ servo ] ( a ) now simplifies to that shown in figure [ servo](b ) , with the closed loop output now given by @xmath102 \\ \\",

    "recall that the detection noise , @xmath98 , is the fundamental error in the measurement of the relative phase of the two beams for the lisa detection system .",
    "a rigorous calculation of this noise source , included in appendix [ qmc ] , shows that its root power spectral density is equal to @xmath105 at the output of the phase meter .",
    "@xmath106 is the electronic noise of the photoreceiver at the beat note frequency .",
    "referenced to the output of the phasemeter this will be well below the @xmath107 level .",
    "a phasemeter noise floor of @xmath105 has been set as a requirement for the phasemeter noise .",
    "this level of performance has already been demonstrated ( @xcite , @xcite ) over the frequency range of interest ( 1  mhz to 1 hz ) albeit with heterodyne frequencies of a few kilohertz .",
    "given these estimates of the individual noise sources a total measurement error , @xmath108 of less than @xmath109 is expected .",
    "the second source of error in eq .",
    "( [ closedloop ] ) represents the finite suppression of the free running laser noise .",
    "this term is inversely proportional to the loop gain and so can be reduced by increasing the gain . very high gains should be possible with lisa as the frequencies of interest are very low @xcite , @xmath110  hz and lower .",
    "a free - running laser frequency noise of 1  mhz/@xmath111 at 1  mhz corresponds to a phase noise of @xmath112  cycles/@xmath111 . a total loop gain of @xmath113 is therefore required to suppress the contribution of laser frequency noise down to 1  @xmath114 . at low frequencies",
    "the laser phase is altered by changing the temperature of the laser crystal .",
    "this actuator has a typical ( voltage to frequency ) gain of 5  ghz / volt or @xmath115 at 1  mhz .",
    "thus a controller gain of 200  v / cycle is needed .",
    "this gain requirement could be eased by `` pre - stabilizing '' the laser frequency , for example by locking to a low finesse cavity or other frequency reference .",
    "initial results from bench top experiments ( @xcite,@xcite ) indicate that loop gains of the order of @xmath113 should be achievable , and hence that pre - stabilization may not be necessary .",
    "the master - slave configuration phase locking requirement should be that the noise introduced by the locking process is insignificant compared to the @xmath116 of optical path noise allocated in the lisa noise budget @xcite .",
    "as the analysis above has shown , phase locking is limited only by the measurement noise ( assuming adequate gain ) .",
    "this measurement noise is common to both the one - way and the master - slave schemes and so , given adequate gain of the phase locking loop , there will be no difference in the performance of the two systems .",
    "in this section we compare the hardware needed by the two implementations of tdi discussed in the previous sections .",
    "the discussion will focus on the minimum hardware requirements and will not fully consider redundancy or fallback options .",
    "we will consider lisa as composed of several basic subsystems , and compare the type and quantity of the components required by each scheme .",
    "both schemes rely on a sufficiently high laser frequency stability .",
    "this is because the cancellation of laser frequency noise via tdi is not exact due to finite accuracy of the arm length knowledge , finite timing accuracy , imperfect clock synchronization , and sampling time jitters .",
    "the frequency stabilization system could be composed of either an optical cavity , a gas cell , or a combination of both .",
    "the output is an error signal proportional to the difference between the laser frequency and the resonance frequency of the reference .",
    "assuming that an optical cavity is used as the frequency reference with a pound - drever - hall locking @xcite readout , the frequency stabilization system will consist of an electro - optic phase modulator , an optical cavity , a photoreceiver , a double - balanced mixer , and a low pass filter @xcite .",
    "a phasemeter is a device capable of measuring the phase of a photoreceiver output relative to the local uso .",
    "one could distinguish between two types of phasemeter : single - quadrature phasemeters , denoted pm(s ) , and full - range phasemeters , denoted pm(f ) .",
    "an example of a single - quadrature phasemeter is a mixer .",
    "it will have only a limited linear range as the output is generally sinusoidal .",
    "a single - quadrature phasemeter has several potential advantages over a full - range phasemeter including lower noise , higher speed operation , increased reliability and lower power consumption .",
    "however , it is restricted in usefulness to closed loop operation only and is therefore not suitable for use in the one - way method .",
    "a single - quadrature phasemeter could potentially be used in the master - slaves configuration where one laser is phase locked to another with a fixed phase shift ( see section iv .",
    "a full - range phasemeter has an output that is linearly proportional to phase over the entire range @xmath117 to @xmath118 .",
    "an example of a full - range phasemeter is a zero - crossing time interval analyzer .",
    "as we show in section v. e , phasemeters used in an open - loop configuration must have a dynamic range of at least @xmath119 at @xmath120 mhz .",
    "a controller takes the signal from either a frequency stabilization system or phasemeter , amplifies and filters it appropriately , and feeds it back to the frequency / phase actuators of a laser .",
    "a controller is needed to frequency lock a laser to a frequency reference or to phase lock one laser to another . in practice",
    "the frequency locking and phase locking controllers will differ by a pole in the controller transfer function and by a gain factor . depending on the sophistication of its design , a controller",
    "could potentially be reconfigured in - flight to perform either function .",
    "each scheme requires twelve photoreceivers to measure the interference from the front and back of the proof masses .",
    "the photoreceiver unit will consist of a photodiode and low - noise electronic amplifiers .",

    "the components needed on each optical bench are shown in the right hand column of table i. the six lasers are frequency stabilized to their six respective frequency references .",
    "the phases of the beat notes of each local laser with the lasers from the adjacent spacecraft and bench are measured by full - range phasemeters to provide twelve data streams .",
    "the data from the phasemeters at the back of the proof masses on adjacent benches can be combined before being recorded without loss of generality .",
    "this reduces the total number of data streams to be recorded and processed to nine , as shown in table ii .",
    "however , as we will show in section v c the number of data streams to be exchanged between spacecraft will be the same for the one - way and master - slaves configuration .",
    "from tables i and ii it is clear that the one - way and master - slaves configurations are almost identical in terms of the quantity of components required .",
    "however , there are several more subtle differences in the hardware requirements of the two schemes .",
    "a disadvantage of the one - way method is that the laser frequencies may differ by as much as @xmath121  mhz if high finesse cavities are used as the frequency references .",
    "this maximum frequency offset is determined by the free spectral range of the reference cavity , where a cavity with a round trip optical path of 0.5  m has been assumed .",
    "this large frequency offset will place greater demands on the photoreceivers bandwidth than the master - slave configuration where frequency offsets can be kept to the minimum dictated by the doppler shifts ( less than @xmath122  mhz ) . not only does the high heterodyne frequency place strict requirements on the photodetector bandwidth , but also on the bandwidth stability .",
    "for example , assume that photoreceivers with a bandwidth of @xmath123  ghz are used for the main signal readouts .",
    "although a heterodyne frequency , @xmath124 , of 300  mhz is within the 1  ghz photoreceiver bandwidth there will be a 0.05  cycle phase delay at this frequency ( the phase shift is equal to -arctan@xmath125 radians for a simple single - pole type frequency response ) . if the bandwidth of a photodetector changes , then this phase shift will also change in a way that is indistinguishable from the effects of a gravitational wave .",
    "a simple calculation shows that a bandwidth change of a mere @xmath126 ( or 230khz ) would introduce a phase signal of 10  @xmath127cycles/@xmath111 for information at 300  mhz . if the heterodyne frequency is kept to 10  mhz or less , then a photoreceiver bandwidth change of more than @xmath128 ( or 6  mhz )",
    "would be needed to produce a 10  @xmath127cycles/@xmath111 phase shift .",
    "in section iii it was shown that a total loop gain of @xmath113 at 1 mhz is required to ensure that the phase locking loop performs correctly . using the one - way method the phase locking loops are replaced by frequency locking to the reference cavity .",
    "the frequency stabilization system is expected to be limited by fluctuations in length of the cavity at a level of the order of 10 hz/@xmath111 at 1 mhz . under this condition",
    "no advantage is gained by suppressing the measured laser noise below this level and so a loop gain of @xmath129 should suffice .",
    "the one - way method therefore requires a controller gain of only @xmath130  volts / cycle at 1  mhz compared to the 200  volts / cycle needed for the master - slave configuration .",
    "the limitations on the effectiveness of the tdi technique , either when the one - way or the master - slave configuration is implemented , come not only from all the secondary noise sources affecting the measurements @xmath63 ( such as proof - mass and optical path noises ) but most importantly from the finite accuracy and precision of the quantities needed to synthesize the laser - noise free observables themselves . in order to synthesize the four generators of the space of all interferometric combinations , we need :    \\(i ) to know the distances between the three pairs of spacecraft ;    \\(ii ) to synchronize the clocks onboard the three spacecraft , which are used in the data acquisition and digitization process ;    \\(iii ) to be able to apply time - delays that are not integer multiples of the sampling time of the digitized phase measurements ;    \\(iv ) to minimize the effects of the jitter of the sampling times themselves ; and    \\(v ) to have sufficiently high dynamic range in the digitized data in order to be able to recover the gravitational wave signal after removing the laser noise .    in the following subsections",
    "we will assume the secondary random processes to be due to the proof masses and the optical path noises @xcite .",
    "we will estimate the minimum values of the accuracies and precisions of the physical quantities listed above that allow the suppression of the laser frequency fluctuations below the level identified by the secondary noise sources .",
    "for each physical quantity the estimate of the accuracy and/or precision needed will be performed by assuming all the remaining errors to be equal to zero .",
    "our estimates , therefore , will provide only an order of magnitude estimate of the accuracies and/or precisions needed for successfully implementing tdi .",
    "the tdi combinations described in the previous sections rely on the assumption of knowing the armlengths sufficiently accurately to suppress laser noise well below other noises . since the three armlengths will be known only within the accuracies @xmath131 respectively , the cancellation of the laser frequency fluctuations from the combinations ( @xmath3 ) will no longer be exact . in order to estimate the magnitude of the laser fluctuations remaining in these data sets ,",

    "that is , we envision triggering the phasemeter such that the time series are sampled at the times required to form the tdi combinations . in this case",

    "as shown in figure 5 , the maximum of the ratio of the laser noise and of the secondary noises phase fluctuation amplitudes occurs at the lower end of the lisa bandwidth , and is @xmath214 at 0.1 mhz .",
    "this corresponds to the minimum dynamic range for the phasemeters to correctly measure the laser fluctuations and the weaker signals simultaneously .",

    "thus the error depends on two parameters , the beam splitter ratio and the intensity noise of the local oscillator . assuming the local laser intensity is shot noise limited at the modulation frequency and a beam splitter ratio of approximately 100:1 ( @xmath260 ) gives a phase error with a standard deviation , @xmath261 , of approximately @xmath262 of the shot noise limit or less than 1  @xmath127cycle@xmath263 error .",
    "this error is therefore much less than the 20  @xmath127cycles@xmath218 optical path noise .",
    "if necessary , this source of error could be removed by altering the detection system to add a second detector allowing subtraction and consequent cancellation of the intensity noise of the local oscillator laser .",

    "changing the sampling frequency will not improve the function estimator for a fixed digital filter size : a lower sampling frequency would be insufficient to represent the high frequency signal components , and a higher sampling frequency would reduce the size of the interval over which the function is sampled to build the estimator .",
    "assuming @xmath264 to be a wide sense stationary stochastic process @xcite with autocorrelation function @xmath277 $ ] ( @xmath278 $ ] denotes the expectation value ) , it follows that the autocorrelation function of the estimation error is equal to @xmath279 where @xmath280 ( @xmath281 ) is the value of @xmath282 ( @xmath283 ) rounded to the nearest integer .",
    "this equation shows that @xmath284 is not wide sense stationary ; however , it is wide sense cyclo - stationary , since @xmath285 for every integer @xmath286 .",
    "this is just a consequence of the error varying quasi - periodically with the interpolation time ; it is zero when @xmath171 matches a sample time , maximum at the middle between two sample times , etc .",
    "a fair estimate of the estimation error magnitude can be obtained by considering the stochastic process @xmath287 , where @xmath288 is a random variable uniformly distributed in @xmath289 $ ] .",
    "@xmath290 is wide sense stationary , and its autocorrelation function is @xcite @xmath291 the fourier transform of @xmath292 gives an estimate of the spectrum of the noise induced by the digital filters interpolation errors . in particular , @xmath293 is the broadband standard deviation of the noise .",
    "taking @xmath264 to be a laser phase noise with a power spectral density that scales like @xmath294 , and restricting attention to the frequency range 0.1 mhz @xmath295 1 hz , one can calculate numerically that @xmath296 for @xmath297 .",
    "therefore , a filter with @xmath297 is good enough only to produce a broadband error on the shifted time series that is @xmath298 orders of magnitude smaller than the laser phase noise amplitude .",
    "changing @xmath299 in the numerical integrations shows that @xmath293 scales roughly like @xmath300 .",

    "<S> either operational mode could therefore be implemented without major implications on the hardware configuration .    </S>",
