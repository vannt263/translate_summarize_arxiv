    "in the recent years , the statistical physics techniques have been successfully applied in the description of socioeconomic phenomena . among the studied problems we can cite opinion dynamics , language evolution , biological aging , dynamics of stock markets , earthquakes and many others @xcite .",
    "these interdisciplinary topics are usually treated by means of computer simulations of agent - based models , which allow us to understand the emergence of collective phenomena in those systems .",
    "recently , the impact of nonconformity in opinion dynamics has atracted attention of physicists @xcite .",
    "anticonformists are similar to conformists , since both take cognizance of the group norm .",
    "thus , conformers agree with the norm , anticonformers disagree . on the other hand",
    ", we have the independent behavior , where the individual tends to resist to the groups influence . as discussed in @xcite , independence is a kind of nonconformity , and it acts on an opinion model as a kind of stochastic driving that can lead the model to undergo a phase transition . in fact , independence plays the role of a random noise similar to social temperature @xcite .    in this work",
    "we study the impact of independence on agents behavior in a kinetic exchange opinion model . for this purpose",
    ", we introduce a probability @xmath3 of agents to make independent decisions .",
    "our analytical results and numerical simulations show that the model undergoes a phase transition at critical points @xmath5 that depend on another model parameter , related to the agents flexibility .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the microscopic rules that define the model and in section 3 the numerical and analytical results are discussed .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "our model is based on kinetic exchange opinion models ( keom ) @xcite .",
    "a population of @xmath6 agents is defined on a fully - connected graph , i.e. , each agent can interact with all others , which characterizes a mean - field - like scheme .",
    "in addition , each agent @xmath7 carries one of three possible opinions ( or states ) , namely @xmath8 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "the following microscopic rules govern the dynamics :    1 .",
