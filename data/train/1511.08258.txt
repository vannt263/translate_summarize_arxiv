    "many first - order phase transitions ( fopts ) are driven to occur by varying the temperature @xmath1 and thermal hysteresis often ensues .",
    "the energy dissipations in the processes studied by internal frictions  @xcite and by thermal analysis  @xcite were found to follow a power law with respect to the sweep rate @xmath2 of the temperature . on the basis of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau theory of a @xmath3 model with an @xmath4 symmetry in the vector order parameter @xmath5 space in the limit of large components @xmath6 , it was found that the areas @xmath7 of the thermal hysteresis loops under a sinusoidally varying temperature depend on the amplitude @xmath8 of the variation as @xmath9 with a hysteresis exponent @xmath10  @xcite . by using a linearly rather than sinusoidally varying temperature with a constant rate @xmath2 , which is experimentally more amenable , familiar spindle - shaped thermal hysteresis loops of both the large-@xmath6 @xmath3 and mean - field models",
    "were reached  @xcite . in an entropy @xmath11 versus @xmath1 frame",
    ", the areas of the loops , which are proportional to the energy dissipations in the cycles , were found to be @xmath12 with @xmath13 independent of the model parameters , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants  @xcite .",
    "this dynamic hysteresis scaling including the exponent has been confirmed experimentally in a nematic  smectic-@xmath7 phase transition of a binary mixture under a linearly varying temperature  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown by a renormalization - group ( rg ) theory that the fopts driven by an applied external field in a scalar @xmath16 model _ below _ its critical temperature are controlled by the instability fixed point of a derived @xmath17 model  @xcite .",
    "although it is imaginary in value , the fixed point is physical counter - intuitively in order for the @xmath17 theory to be mathematically convergent  @xcite .",
    "numerical evidence from the potts model for the fixed point has also been found  @xcite .",
    "a functional rg theory has extended the theory to contain all odd - order terms and given rise to consistent exponents  @xcite .",
    "these then place the scaling behavior of the fopts in the same universality class to the yang - lee edge singularity  @xcite , the singularity of the distribution of the yang - lee zeros _ above _ the critical point .    in the @xmath0 theory  @xcite ,",
    "one first notices that , for an fopt , there exists a sharply defined curve of spinodals at which the associated susceptibility diverges on the mean - field level that becomes exact for long ranged interactions . upon an expansion near them ,",
    "these spinodals manifest themselves as the `` critical '' point of a @xmath0 theory , because the mean - field free energy now contains a @xmath0 term as the leading coupling term even if the symmetry of the original theory excludes it .",
    "as the @xmath0 theory is unstable at its critical point , we dub it instability point and the critical exponents characterizing it instability exponents .",
    "although one has a @xmath0 theory for the unstable phenomena instead of the usual @xmath18 one for critical phenomena , one can easily convince oneself , as will be seen in the sections following for the temperature - driving transitions , that the whole theory for the latter applies to the former as well  @xcite .",
    "this includes the definitions ( or the meaning ) and computations of the mean - field instability exponents , the fluctuations that lead to a divergent correlation length , the ginzburg criterion for the relative importance of the fluctuations , the shift of the instability point due to the fluctuations , and the rg theory for the non - gaussian fixed point and its associated non - mean - field instability exponents , which combine to characterize the hysteresis near the instability point , as well as the irrelevance of the neglected higher order terms  @xcite .",
    "however , there exist several possible questions to the @xmath0 theory .",
    "the first one concerns the physical meaning of the instability points and the existence of the spinodals .",
    "for a system with short - ranged interactions , it is generally believed that there exist no sharply defined spinodals in contrary to the mean - field case with long - ranged interactions  @xcite .",
    "this can be readily understood from the fact that thermal fluctuations simply smear any possible spinodal out into a region when the nucleation barrier is on the order of the thermal energy . emphasizing the effect of the fluctuations nevertheless , the existence of a crossover between nucleation and spinodal decomposition is out of question as the former needs activation whereas the latter does not at least away from the crossover region and at the early time of the transition .",
    "it is then more than natural to postulate the existence of hidden spinodals which , albeit smeared out again by the thermal fluctuations , control the crossover .",
    "these hidden spinodals , which are shifted by the fluctuations away from their mean - field values , are nothing but the shifted instability points .",
    "their magnitudes are non - universal and depends on the coarse grained scale , in agreement with numerical results  @xcite .",
    "although studies were performed that vary the range of interactions to approach the mean - field spinodals  @xcite , from the analogous @xmath18 theory for criticality , it is clear that the mean - field theory is only the correct starting point for the rg analysis of fluctuations in systems with short - ranged interactions .",
    "there is no apparent contradiction at all in describing the critical ( unstable ) behavior of a short - ranged - interaction system around a particular point existing only within the long - ranged - interaction mean - field models .",
    "another question pertains to the only prominent difference between the @xmath0 and the @xmath18 theories , viz .",
    ", the fixed point of the former is imaginary in value .",
    "however , it has been found that for a physical coupling of a purely real initial value , the rg flow has to diverge at a finite scale in order to achieve an imaginary part  @xcite . upon combining a momentum - shell integration rg analysis and a nucleation theory @xcite near the spinodal point @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that  @xcite , exactly at the finite scale , vanishes the free - energy cost for nucleation out of the metastable state in which the system lies , together with the potential well of the metastable state itself .",
    "this places the system exactly at a true instability point and thus exhibiting the divergence at the scale .",
    "the integration for the partition function then diverges and has to be analytically continued to the complex plane in order to be physically meaningful . as a consequence",
    ", the system enters the imaginary domain and can thus reach the imaginary fixed point .",
    "therefore , counter to the intuition that only real values are physical , for the @xmath0 theory , imaginary values are physical instead  @xcite .",
    "yet another possible question is the relation to the nucleation and growth  @xcite .",
    "as the theory is an expansion around the instability points , it can apparently describe the behavior of spinodal decomposition  @xcite at least at its early time .",
    "we note that , as the other dynamical mode of fopts , nucleation is the classical theory for fopts and has been argued to result in , for small @xmath2 , a hysteresis which vanishes in a purely logarithmic form  @xcite .",
    "although it has been shown unambiguously that this non - perturbative nucleation effect can only play a role at extremely low rates which are not accessible experimentally  @xcite , no evidence of an overall power - law relationship has been found for the magnetic hysteresis in a sinusoidally oscillating field in two dimensions either  @xcite .",
    "a direct consequence of these nucleation theory is that the hysteresis loop ought to shrink and vanish in the limit of small rates .",
    "however , numerical simulations of the ising model found existence of a dynamic phase transition at finite amplitudes of the field , the transition below which the switch between the two phases of opposite magnetizations can not take place  @xcite .",
    "it was even claimed that a finite field is needed to flip the magnetization even in the static limit of the field  @xcite .",
    "these indicate that nucleation alone can not be all the story and the loci at which the dynamic transition occurs may well be the dynamic instability points even in the regime in which nucleation is thought to be dominant .",
    "the combination of the rg and the nucleation theory mentioned above shows that  @xcite the characteristic length scale , at which the rg flows diverge and become imaginary , divides the fluctuating field of a metastable system into two sets .",
    "the short modes feel a finite potential well and are responsible for nucleation , whereas the long ones have none and are controlled by the imaginary fixed point .",
    "although the short modes are renormalized away when coarse - grained and are thus irrelevant in the sense of the rg theory , they may well compete with the long ones in a real system itself in which no renormalization is performed and mask the scaling behavior . physically in a real system , when the time scale of nucleating out of the metastable state is shorter than that of the driving from , say , the equilibrium transition point to near the instability point , nucleation will probably occur .",
    "but even near the instability point where nucleation barriers still exist owing to the @xmath18 interaction that is irrelevant and neglected in the @xmath0 theory , nucleation may still play a role .",
    "accordingly , how to disentangle the nucleation and the scaling from the @xmath17 theory is yet to be resolved .",
    "it is therefore helpful to turn to more examples .",
    "here , we shall develop rg theories for the dynamics of temperature - driven fopts in scalar models .",
    "we find that although they are driven by varying the temperature instead of an external field , these fopts are again controlled by the same instability fixed point of the @xmath17 theory for field - driven transitions .",
    "distinct from the latter case , however , there are now complicate behavior .",
    "the temperature - driven fopts exhibit three universality classes with three sets of thermal hysteresis exponents .",
    "we call them thermal class i , ii , and iii , corresponding respectively to a field - like thermal class , a partly thermal class , and a purely thermal class",
    ". there is also a crossover between the first two classes .",
    "the last class can have further variants depending on the symmetry of the model .",
    "all these rich behaviors are clearly demonstrated from reduced models and well accounted for by the rg theories .    in the following , we shall first study mean - field models for the thermal transitions in sec .",
    "[ model ] and identify the three different universality classes in sec .  [ mft ] .",
    "various reduced models for the different classes are also derived in the section . a scaling theory is then developed in sec .  [ scaling ] to account for the peculiar scaling behavior .",
    "the rg theories for them follows in sec .",
    "a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "as a simple model that involves an fopt between an ordered phase at low temperatures and a disordered phase at high temperatures , we consider the following free - energy functional @xcite in a @xmath19-dimensional space @xmath20=\\int{d\\mathrm{\\mathbf{r}}\\left\\ {   { \\frac{1}{2}r\\phi^{2}+\\frac{1}% { 2}[\\nabla\\phi]^{2}+\\frac{1}{3!}w\\phi^{3}+\\frac{1}{4!}g\\phi^{4}-h\\phi } \\right\\ }   } , \\label{f}%\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a reduced temperature proportional to @xmath1 , @xmath22 an external field conjugated to the scalar order parameter field @xmath5 , while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are coupling constants . for stability , @xmath25 . yet , @xmath23 can be either positive or negative . for simplicity , we shall choose @xmath26 throughout , which results in an ordered phase with a positive equilibrium order parameter .",
    "equation  ( [ f ] ) contains a cubic term and thus @xmath5 has no inversion symmetry .",
    "if this symmetry is respected , on the other hand , a @xmath27 term has to be included in order to have a thermal fopt @xcite .",
    "however , it will be seen later on that the transition is still governed by the same theory to be developed below except the cooling transition in @xmath28 , which belongs to the purely thermal class .",
    "we thus focus here on the model defined by eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) .    to study the transition driven to metastable states as the temperature is varied , dynamics has to be taken into account .",

    ", there is a special case in which @xmath109 is real .",
    "this is the case for the cooling spinodals in @xmath28 , in which @xmath110 and thus @xmath109 is simply @xmath55 .",
    "consequently , eq .  ( [ langevin 3 ] ) is just eq .",
    "( [ me ] ) with the cubic term omitted . also , in this case , @xmath111 , which is the reason why we have kept only the plus sign for it .",
    "we see therefore that most of the temperature - driven transitions in the mean - field theory can not be cast into a purely massive theory with real parameters . nevertheless",
    ", we still study it as multiplying by the imaginary unit @xmath112 changes formally the theory to that of the yang - lee edge singularity , which falls into the same universality class as mentioned .",
    "the foregoing discussions indicate that besides the two equivalent reduced models  ( [ langevin 2 ] ) and ( [ langevin 3 ] ) , there exists another purely massive model @xmath113 which we call purely thermal model .",
    "the only difference between the two purely massive models is that the mass term is @xmath55 instead of @xmath109 for the purely thermal model because the order parameter at the instability point vanishes .",
    "as mentioned , the model  ( [ ptm ] ) describes the cooling transition in @xmath28 in the mean - field approximation .",

    "an effective field @xmath57 is generated . as a consequence",

    "the purely thermal model  ( [ ptm ] ) can be generalized to a general form , @xmath114 with an integer @xmath115 . for @xmath116",

    "if the gaussian noise  ( [ noise ] ) is reintroduced back , all the four reduced models can describe the fluctuations near the instability points .",
    "the massless model was studied in  @xcite and the equilibrium properties of the purely thermal model was investigated in  @xcite . for temperature - driven fopts , however , the controlling parameter in the first two models is a nonlinear function of @xmath55 , the reduced temperature to the instability point .",
    "we shall see that it is this nonlinearity that leads to the complication of the dynamic scaling for such transitions .",
    "the purely thermal model with an even @xmath115 in the presence of fluctuations also returns to the first two models . only the generalized purely thermal model with an odd @xmath115",
    "has simple behavior due to its free of the nonlinearity .",
    "in fact , it gives rise to the purely thermal class of thermal class iii , which also results from the purely thermal model with an even @xmath115 in mean field , while the first two models result in the other two classes and their crossover in some special limits . in the following ,",

    "the last class is characterized by the purely thermal models and contains different universality classes depending on the symmetry of the order parameters .",
    "an example is the @xmath118 model whose cooling transition in the absence of an applied external field falls into the same universality class to the nonequilibrium critical phenomena of a usual @xmath18 model . if odd - symmetry terms are allowed in the free energies , thermal class iii emerges only in the mean - field limit and is identical with thermal class ii .",
    "it changes to the other two classes when fluctuations are considered .",
    "numerical and analytical results in the mean - field level agree well with the scaling analysis .",
    "the renormalization - group theories both confirm the scaling theory and the relation between the massless model and the purely massive model and provide methods to calculate the hysteresis exponents of various universality classes .",
    "using the extant three- and two - loop results for the static and dynamic exponents for the yang - lee edge singularity , which falls into the same universality class to the @xmath0 theory , we have estimated the thermal hysteresis exponents of the various classes to the same precisions .",
