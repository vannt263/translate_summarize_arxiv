    "<S> incompressible magnetohydrodynamics is often assumed to describe solar wind turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> we use extended self similarity to reveal scaling in structure functions of density fluctuations in the solar wind . </S>",
    "<S> obtained scaling is then compared with that found in the inertial range of quantities identified as passive scalars in other turbulent systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these are not coincident . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that either solar wind turbulence is compressible , or that straightforward comparison of structure functions does not adequately capture its inertial range properties .    </S>",
    "<S> the supersonic and super - alfvnic flow of the solar wind offers a unique opportunity to investigate the properties of the magnetized and turbulent plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from a laminar to turbulent flow requires large reynolds number @xmath0 , and its magnetic counterpart @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the energy injection scale length , @xmath3 is the velocity difference on scale @xmath2 , @xmath4 is the viscosity and @xmath5 is the magnetic diffusivity . </S>",
    "<S> estimations of the hydrodynamic and magnetic reynolds numbers in the solar wind exceed @xmath6@xcite compared with @xmath7 achieved in direct numerical simulations ( dns)@xcite and just few hundreds in some magnetized liquid laboratory experiments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of turbulence in the solar wind is strongly suggested by numerous observations . </S>",
    "<S> these include power law power spectra with @xmath8 kolmogorov - like slopes in the kinetic and magnetic energy densities ( eg . , @xcite ) and non - gaussian probability density functions ( pdfs ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) found for fluctuations in the velocity and the magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> these observations imply that solar wind turbulence shares many of its statistical properties with incompressible isotropic hydrodynamic turbulence @xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the turbulent dynamics of the solar wind is often modelled assuming that the plasma density is constant . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption of incompressibility is particularly convenient in analytical and numerical studies of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the assumption of incompressibility also appears to be in good agreement with the results of compressive mhd simulations where generation of compressive modes from alfvnic turbulence was found to be suppressed@xcite .    in the context of the solar wind </S>",
    "<S> , incompressibility has been suggested to be a reasonable approximation for plasma in fast wind streams@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> considerable progress has been made by treating the solar wind as dominated by alfvnic fluctuations ( e.g.,@xcite ) and with nearly incompressible magnetohydrodynamic theory@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however , statistical features associated with turbulence have also been identified in the density fluctuations derived from the solar wind observations . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath9 scaling in the omnidirectional wave number spectrum of electron and proton density has been reported as early as the @xmath10s ( see @xcite and the references therein ) </S>",
    "<S> . models of the solar wind can offer possible mechanisms for generating strong density fluctuations close to the heliospheric current sheets@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent studies suggest that , at least in the slow solar wind , the coupling of alfvnic and magnetosonic mhd modes could not fully describe the nature of these fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the ratio @xmath11 was found to be nearly constant and independent from the amplitude of the magnetic field fluctuations @xmath12 in the slow solar wind@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently the density fluctuations were also found to exhibit non trivial , approximately self - affine scaling@xcite similar to that found in other solar wind bulk plasma parameters .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we examine the scaling properties of the proton density @xmath13 in fast and in slow solar wind . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a comparison of the scaling properties of fluctuations in density with that of various passive scalars identified in experiments , and direct numerical simulations , of fluid turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> previously , these passive scalars have been shown to exhibit scaling that corresponds closely to that of the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath14 in the solar wind , although the data interval was not ordered by solar wind speed @xcite . by assuming incompressibility it can be argued @xcite that @xmath14 should act as a passive scalar . </S>",
    "<S> we will for completeness also examine the scaling properties of magnetic field magnitude in fast and slow solar wind .    </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to recall that the dynamics of a passive scalar @xmath15 in a velocity field @xmath16 is given by the advection equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the diffusivity . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical and statistical properties of a passive scalar are more tractable analytically , as compared to active fields like velocity , since the equation ( [ adv ] ) is linear in @xmath19 . in the case of hydrodynamics , </S>",
    "<S> theoretical predictions have also been verified , to some extent , experimentally using tracer particles that do not disturb the flow@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the compressible mhd equations for the evolution of the magnetic field and the density : @xmath20 given the assumption of incompressibility ( @xmath21 ) , it immediately follows that @xmath13 should behave as a passive scalar in the turbulent solar wind flow : @xmath22    to investigate the scaling properties of the density @xmath13 and the magnetic field magnitude @xmath14 we use @xmath23 seconds averaged data from the ace spacecraft @xcite set spanning from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> this interval includes dates previously considered in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the slow and fast solar wind are known to exhibit distinct phenomenology ( e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus split the data into slow and fast solar wind sets using @xmath26km / s wind speed as a separation criteria . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting data sets consist of @xmath27 samples for the slow wind and @xmath28 for the fast wind . </S>",
    "<S> we apply structure function@xcite analysis to fluctuations in density for slow and fast wind separately . </S>",
    "<S> generalized structure functions @xmath29 of fluctuations in say , the density @xmath30 , on timescale @xmath31 are defined as moments @xmath32 through @xmath33 where the ensemble @xmath34 is taken in the time domain @xcite . if scaling is present in the time series we expect these to show a power law dependence on the temporal scale @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> finite , experimental data sets include a small number of extreme events ( outliers ) that , due to poor statistics , may obscure the correct scaling of the high order moments . here , we will exclude these events by the use of _ conditioning _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach puts a limit on the range of fluctuations used in computing structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> this limit is varied with the temporal scale @xmath31 to account for the growth of range with temporal scale in the signal . in our case </S>",
    "<S> we defined this threshold as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a standard deviation of fluctuations on temporal scale @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> we stress that conditioning improves the scaling where it already exists but does not enforce it on the investigated data , if the applied threshold is sufficiently large . in practice , for the limit chosen here , we eliminate less then @xmath38 of the data points .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1 ] shows the structure functions @xmath29 plotted versus @xmath31 on logarithmic axes for orders @xmath39 for fluctuations in density in the slow solar wind . </S>",
    "<S> the plot shows a scaling region extending from @xmath40 minutes to @xmath41 hours ( @xmath42 decades on the logarithmic scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the scaling deteriorates when fast wind streams are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling regions can be still identified but they extend only @xmath43 decade from @xmath44 minutes to @xmath45 hour .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been empirically shown that extended self similarity ( ess ) approach can considerably extend the region of scaling in structure functions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on the assumption that @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that scaling should emerge when the quantity @xmath29 is plotted as a function of @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling exponent @xmath48 can then be obtained straightforwardly from the relation @xmath49 . for the density fluctuations in the solar wind , we find that @xmath50 is close to unity and we plot @xmath29 versus @xmath50 on logarithmic axes for fluctuations in the density in slow and fast solar wind , in figures [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these figures demonstrate that we can extend scaling in the density in both the slow and the fast wind streams to over @xmath51 decades when ess is applied .    </S>",
    "<S> ess was previously applied to the magnitude of magnetic field in an undifferentiated interval of solar wind@xcite and for completeness we give the analysis in slow and fast wind here . </S>",
    "<S> figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] show @xmath29 versus @xmath50 on logarithmic axes for fluctuations in the magnitude of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> previously , the scaling exponents were obtained by considering @xmath29 versus @xmath52@xcite and we have verified that these closely correspond to the values found here . </S>",
    "<S> the local slopes of the third order structure functions @xmath50 then yield an estimate of the exponent @xmath53 and these are detailed in table [ tab1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now directly compare the scaling found for the density @xmath13 with that identified for quantities acting as passive scalars and that of the magnetic field magnitude @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting functional form of the scaling exponents @xmath54 for the density and magnetic field magnitude in slow and fast solar wind are shown in figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] respectively . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , the scaling exponents obtained for passive scalars from the dns @xcite and the the wind tunnel experiment@xcite are also shown . </S>",
    "<S> we immediately see that whereas the exponents for magnetic field magnitude and the passive scalars fall close to each other on these plots ( as also reported in @xcite ) they are distinct from those obtained for the solar wind density in both slow and fast solar wind . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations in @xmath55 , for slow and fast wind , and that of the passive scalars exhibit multi - fractal scaling . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , the density fluctuations are nearly self - affine with scaling exponent @xmath56 that differs in slow and fast wind . </S>",
    "<S> the values of these exponents are : @xmath57 and @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> this suggests one of two possible conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> the first of these is that the turbulent solar wind is compressible and equation ( [ mhdrincomp ] ) does not hold , so that the density is an active quantity . </S>",
    "<S> this is rather surprising and calls into question the significant body of work on mhd turbulence in the solar wind that relies on the assumption of incompressibility ( for example , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this also invalidates the arguments in ref.@xcite required to cast the advection equation for @xmath14 in the form of a passive scalar which require incompressibility , yielding : @xmath59    the second possibility is that commonality of scaling ( as measured by structure functions ) does not imply shared phenomenology , and as a corollary , an absence of such a commonality does not imply distinct phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that several quantities share the same structure functions is then coincidental rather than expressing some universality of fluid turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the structure functions of a single quantity do not fully capture the phenomenology of a given turbulent system . </S>",
    "<S> this has implications for analysis of turbulence which has been achieved through comparison between ( multi - fractal ) models of turbulence and the data , via the structure functions ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> .exponents @xmath53 obtained from figures [ fig3 ] . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab1 ]    a possible resolution may be found in the form of equations ( [ mhdrincomp ] ) and ( [ mhdbincomp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the molecular diffusivity can change the inertial range scaling properties of a passive scalar@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed differences could then be due to the presence of the diffusive term in the magnetic field equation ( [ mhdbincomp ] ) and its absence in the density equation ( [ mhdrincomp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this may account for the different scaling found in these quantities .    </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , equation ( [ mhdrincomp ] ) , when written for the moments of fluctuations in @xmath13 , has no explicit dependence on the order of the moment @xcite @xmath60 ( \\delta \\rho)^n = 0 , \\label{mhdstrf}\\ ] ] where @xmath61^n$ ] . in this case fluctuations in density should be simply those imposed on the initial condition @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> these may be mediated via large scale coherent structures ( shocks and coronal mass ejections ) . </S>",
    "<S> this may suggest a solar origin of these fluctuations in the density </S>",
    "<S> . it may thus be informative to attempt to relate the scaling found in the density fluctuations in the solar wind , with that of the solar corona . </S>",
    "<S> the power law scaling of x - ray flux from solar flares@xcite is intriguing in this regard . </S>"
