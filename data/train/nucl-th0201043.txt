    "the deuteron s- and d - wave components obtained in the full theory  @xcite and denoted as @xmath9 , @xmath10=@xmath11 , are truncated , in momentum space , as    @xmath12^{1/2 } } \\ , u_l(p ) \\>\\>,\\ ] ]    where the cutoff momentum @xmath13=@xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the pion mass and @xmath16 is an integer ) and @xmath17=@xmath18 .",

    "the wave functions @xmath20 corresponding to @xmath16=1 , 2 and 4 along with the reference @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deut ] .",
    "the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 observables are calculated using these truncated wave functions by including one - body only and both one- and two - body currents .",
    "the results are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : a][fig : t20 ] .    aspects of the present theory  @xcite pertaining to the input potential , the boost corrections in the wave functions , the one and two - body charge and current operators , are succinctly summarized in secs .",
    "[ sec : wave][sec : ffs ] . here",
    "it suffices to note that the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : a][fig : t20 ] are obtained within a scheme in which these various facets are consistently treated to order @xmath21 .",
    "thus the present approach improves and extends that adopted in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , in which relativistic corrections of order @xmath21 were selectively retained .",
    "for example , the @xmath21 contributions associated with the @xmath22-exchange charge operator were included , while those originating from the one - pion - exchange potential and from boosting the wave function were ignored .",
    "the consistent @xmath21 scheme employed here , however , does not alter quantitatively the predictions obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , except for the @xmath3 structure function as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ]",
    ". a detailed analysis of the differences between the two approaches is beyond the scope of this work ; it will be presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we assume that the three - momentum transfer @xmath23 in @xmath0-@xmath1 elastic scattering is in the @xmath24-direction . in the breit frame",
    "the deuteron has initial and final momenta @xmath25 and @xmath26 in this direction , respectively . in the presence of only single - nucleon currents ,",
    "the deuteron wave function has to have components with relative momenta @xmath27=@xmath28 larger than @xmath29 in order to produce elastic scattering at momentum transfer @xmath30 . in a limiting case ,",
    "for example , the nucleons have momenta of @xmath25 and @xmath31 in the initial state and @xmath26 and @xmath31 in the final , all along the @xmath24-axis .",
    "thus elastic scattering via one - body currents probes momentum distributions @xmath9 at @xmath32 .",
    "this argument , however , does not establish the maximum value of @xmath27 which the observed form factors with @xmath5 @xmath6 are sensitive to .",
    "in addition , there is no kinematical limit on initial and final relative momenta for scattering via pair currents .",
    "therefore , we use a realistic model of the deuteron to estimate the maximum value of @xmath27 probed by the available data .",
    "there is growing interest in chiral effective field theories of nuclear forces and currents  @xcite .",
    "in such theories the effective lagrangian is obtained after integrating out states with momenta greater than a specified cutoff .",
    "we hope that the present results provide an estimate of the deuteron structure obtained in theories with cutoff momentum @xmath13=@xmath14 .",
    "the deuteron wave function is dominated by the one - pion exchange potential @xmath33 , where @xmath34=@xmath35 is the momentum transferred by the exchanged pion .",
    "the dependence of @xmath33 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : vpai ] ) below ) on the magnitude @xmath36 is primarily given by the @xmath37 form factor @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "in this limit the leading non - relativistic term of @xmath33 becomes :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is a unit vector .",
    "thus the deuteron wave function at relative momentum @xmath27 is expected to be sensitive to @xmath38 up to @xmath42 .",
    "the results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : a][fig : t20 ] indicate that the available data on deuteron form factors at @xmath5 @xmath6 confirm the present wave functions up to @xmath43 . after including pair - current contributions , the reference wave function and that truncated at @xmath27=@xmath44",

    "the reference and truncated wave functions , respectively , over- and under - predict the observed @xmath2 at @xmath45 @xmath6 ; both under - predict @xmath46 @xmath47 , and fail to reproduce the data point for @xmath48 at @xmath49 @xmath6 .",
    "the available data on @xmath2 at larger values of @xmath30 can be used to test the deuteron wave function at @xmath50 ; however , improved theoretical understanding and more accurate data on @xmath51 @xmath47 , and new data on @xmath52 @xmath47 are needed .",
    "the deuteron rest - frame wave function is obtained by solving the momentum - space schrdinger equation with the relativistic hamiltonian  @xcite    @xmath53    where @xmath54 consists of a short - range part @xmath55 parameterized as in the argonne @xmath56 potential  @xcite , and of a relativistic one - pion - exchange potential ( opep ) given by    @xmath57 { \\bbox \\tau}_1 \\cdot { \\bbox \\tau}_2 \\>\\>. \\label{eq : vpai}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath58 is the nucleon mass , @xmath59 is the pion - nucleon coupling constant ( @xmath60=0.075 ) , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the initial and final momenta of particle 1 in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath34=@xmath63 is the momentum transfer , @xmath64=@xmath65 , and @xmath66=@xmath67 .",
    "the monopole form factor : @xmath68 with @xmath69=1.2 gev / c is used in this work .    the @xmath70-dependent term characterizes possible off - energy - shell extensions of opep , and leads to strong non - localities in configuration space .",
    "in particular , the value @xmath70=1 ( @xmath70=1 ) is predicted by pseudoscalar ( pseudovector ) coupling of pions to nucleons , while @xmath70=0 corresponds to the so - called minimal non - localitychoice  @xcite .",
    "it has been known for over two decades  @xcite , and recently re - emphasized by forest  @xcite that these various off - shell extensions of opep are related to each other by a unitary transformation , in the sense that",

    "this unitary equivalence implies that predictions for electromagnetic observables , such as the form factors under consideration here , are independent of the particular off - shell extension adopted for opep , provided that the electromagnetic current operator , specifically its two - body components associated with pion exchange , are constructed consistently with this off - shell parameter .",
    "this point will be further elaborated below . at this stage , however , it is important to recall that forest has constructed relativistic hamiltonians @xmath74 with @xmath70=@xmath75 , each designed to be phase - equivalent to the non - relativistic @xmath76 , based on the argonne @xmath56 potential .    given this premise , the @xmath70=0 prescription is adopted for opep from now on , and the superscript is dropped from @xmath77 , for ease of presentation .",
    "the resulting momentum - space wave function in the rest frame of the deuteron is denoted with @xmath78 ( here , the argument @xmath31 indicates the rest frame in which the deuteron has velocity @xmath79=0 ) , and is written as    @xmath80 \\eta^0_0 \\>\\>,\\ ] ]    where @xmath81 is the relative momentum , @xmath82 is the angular - momentum projection along the @xmath24-axis , @xmath83 is the pair isospin @xmath84=0 state , and @xmath85 are standard spin - angle functions .",

    "are retained in eq .",
    "( [ eq : boost ] ) .",
    "there are in principle additional , interaction - dependent boost corrections .",
    "those originating from the dominant one - pion - exchange component of the interaction have been constructed explicitly in ref .",
    "@xcite to order @xmath21 . at this order , however , their contribution to the form factors in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g0])([eq : g2 ] ) vanishes , since it involves matrix elements of an odd operator under spin exchange between @xmath93=1 states .",
    "indeed , this same selection rule also holds for the thomas precession term .",
    "therefore the interaction - dependent boost corrections do not contribute to elastic scattering up to order @xmath21 , and are neglected in the following .",
    "it should also be noted that terms of order higher than @xmath21 due to lorentz contraction have in fact been included in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : boost ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath94 ensures that the wave function in the moving frame is normalized to one , ignoring corrections of order @xmath95 from the thomas precession term .",
    "it is interesting to study the relation between the breit - frame matrix element @xmath96 of the point - nucleon density operator , and the rest frame @xmath97 .",

    "@xmath100 is the lorentz factor corresponding to @xmath101 in the breit frame .",
    "this result is consistent with the naive expectation that the density in configuration space is squeezed  in the direction of motion by the lorentz factor @xmath100 or , equivalently , that its fourier transform is pushed out  by @xmath100 . for @xmath30=6 @xmath6 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , corresponding to a 5 % lorentz contraction .",
    "the electromagnetic charge and current operators include one- and two - body terms . only the isoscalar parts need to be considered , since the deuteron has @xmath84=0 .",

    "earlier published work on the form factors of the deuteron  @xcite and a=36 nuclei , most recently  @xcite , boost contributions were neglected , and only terms up to order @xmath21 were included in the non - relativistic expansion of @xmath124 , namely the well known darwin - foldy and spin - orbit corrections to @xmath125 . in the calculations reported here , however , the full lorentz structure of @xmath124 is retained .",
    "the two - body terms included in @xmath126 are those associated with @xmath22- and @xmath127-meson exchanges and the @xmath128 transition mechanism .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath127 spatial current operators to leading order in @xmath129 are isovector , and therefore their contributions vanish in @xmath0-@xmath1 elastic scattering .",

    "it is important to recall that the @xmath22-exchange charge operator corresponding to @xmath70=1 was included in all our previous studies of light nuclei form factors ( for a review , see ref .",

    "while these calculations are not strictly consistent , since relativistic corrections are selectively retained in @xmath125 but ignored in the potentials and wave functions , they nevertheless give fairly accurate results since the corrections to the wave function are rather small @xcite .",
    "vector - meson ( @xmath127 and @xmath140 ) two - body charge operators have been found to give contributions , in calculations of light nuclei form factors  @xcite , that are typically an order of magnitude smaller than those associated with the @xmath141 operator . in the present study ,",

    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rpg ] ) the term proportional to @xmath157 in the @xmath127-meson propagator has been dropped , since it vanishes if the nucleons are assumed to be on mass shell .",

    "@xcite . however , it is known that these lowest - order expansions , particularly that for @xmath158 , are inaccurate .",
    "this fact was first demonstrated by hummel and tjon  @xcite in the context of relativistic boson - exchange - model calculations of the deuteron form factors , based on the blankenbecler - sugar reduction of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "it was later confirmed , in a calculation of the deuteron @xmath3 structure function  @xcite , that next - to - leading - order terms in the expansion for @xmath158 , proportional @xmath159 , very substantially reduce the contribution of the leading term .",
