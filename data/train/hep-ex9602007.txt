    "the study of elastic production of vector mesons in photo- and leptoproduction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : diag]a ) in fixed target experiments has provided information on the hadronic component of the photon and on the nature of diffraction .    with the advent of the electron - proton collider hera ,",
    "there is renewed interest in vector meson production , in particular at large  (  is minus the square of the exchanged photon four - momentum ) .",
    "hera experiments have observed in deep - inelastic scattering that the proton structure function @xmath111 increases rapidly @xcite with increasing , the  invariant mass , which is in striking contrast with the slow rise of the total  cross section at @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the rise of @xmath111 already at relatively low  values ( @xmath113 ) indicates that the transition between these two behaviours is rapid @xcite .",
    "the study of the elastic production of vector mesons is expected to provide useful information about these different regimes , and in particular about the transition between them .",
    "the subject of this paper @xcite is the study of elastic  and  meson electroproduction at large  ( @xmath114 ) and high  ( @xmath115 ) , in the reactions @xmath116 @xmath117    after the presentation of the event selection and of the mass distributions , the total cross sections and the differential distributions for reactions ( [ eq : rh ] ) and ( [ eq : jpsi ] ) are studied .",
    "features relevant for the study of the transition regime are then discussed , in particular the energy dependence of the cross section , the  distribution (  is the square of the four - momentum transferred from the photon to the target ) , the vector meson polarisation , and the evolution of the  :  cross section ratio .",
    "the results are discussed in the light of the interplay of hard and soft physics processes .",
    "results on  production in a similar kinematic range have been presented by the zeus collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the elastic production of light vector mesons , in particular of  mesons , by real or quasi - real photons ( @xmath112 ) , a process called hereafter photoproduction , exhibits numerous features typical of soft , hadron - like interactions .",
    "these are a small angle peak in the distribution of the vector meson scattering angle with respect to the incident photon beam direction ( `` elastic peak '' ) , a steepening of this distribution with increasing energy ( `` shrinkage '' ) , for @xmath118  a slow increase with energy of the cross section , and s - channel helicity conservation ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "these observations support the vector meson dominance model ( vdm ) @xcite , according to which a photon with energy greater than a few  behaves predominantly as the superposition of the lightest ( , , ) @xmath120 mesons . in this framework , the cross section for elastic vector meson production is related to the total meson@xmath2proton cross section through the optical theorem , and the energy dependence is related to the `` universal '' energy dependence of the total hadron@xmath2proton cross section . neglecting a contribution ( `` reggeon exchange '' ) which decreases with energy approximately as @xmath121 , the latter is parameterised at high energy as @xmath122 with @xmath123 , @xmath124 being the hadron@xmath2proton centre of mass energy @xcite .",
    "this is expressed in regge theory as due to soft pomeron exchange .",
    "the elastic production of  mesons has been studied extensively by fixed target experiments in photoproduction @xcite , for intermediate  @xcite and for  @xmath125  @xcite .",
    "also at hera , the photoproduction of  mesons exhibits the characteristic features of soft interactions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the vdm approach does not give a satisfactory description of   photoproduction data @xcite : the cross section is smaller than the vdm prediction ( see @xcite ) and it increases significantly faster with energy than expected from soft pomeron exchange .",
    "this is also observed by the hera experiments @xcite .    using the hard scale provided by the mass of the charm quark ,",
    "the fast increase of the  photoproduction cross section was predicted in the framework of qcd by ryskin @xcite . in his model ,",
    "the interaction between the proton and the @xmath126 pair in the photon is mediated by a gluon ladder , and non - perturbative effects are included in the nucleon parton distribution .    at high energy and high",
    ",  meson production is modelled using two different approaches based on qcd , which both refer to the pomeron as basically a two gluon system ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the  meson production is thus related to the gluon distribution in the proton , but the two approaches emphasize respectively soft or hard behaviour .    in the soft model initially proposed by donnachie and landshoff @xcite , the gluons are described non - perturbatively and the elastic cross section is expected to increase slowly with energy : @xmath127 , with @xmath123 .",
    "the vector mesons are predicted to be mostly longitudinally polarised , the cross section to fall as @xmath128 and the  cross section to be comparable to that of the .    in the second approach ,",
    "perturbative qcd calculations similar to the work of ryskin have been performed by several groups @xcite , a hard scale being provided by the photon virtuality",
    ". a major prediction of this model is a rapid increase of the cross section with , as a consequence of the rise of the gluon distribution in the proton .",
    "it is stressed , however , that non - perturbative processes are also expected to be present in an intermediate energy region @xcite .",
    "the scattering amplitude is obtained in these calculations from the convolution of the hadronic wave function of the photon , of the scattering amplitude of this hadronic component , and of the final state vector meson wave function .",
    "this is because the photon is viewed at sufficient energy as the coherent superposition of hadronic states formed well before the target ( essentially @xmath129 pairs ) , whereas the final state meson is formed beyond it , the corresponding time scales being much longer than the interaction time . as a consequence ,",
    "the spatial dimensions of the hadronic wave function are an essential parameter in the interplay of perturbative and non - perturbative effects .",
    "it is predicted that the hard effects should show up earlier for small size objects than for large ones , and for longitudinally than for transversely polarised photons .",
    "the  dependence of the  cross section is predicted , as in the non - perturbative approach , to fall as @xmath128 but when the evolution of the parton distribution and quark fermi motion are taken into account , it was pointed out that the  distribution is expected to be harder @xcite . in view of the more compact  wave function ,",
    "the  :  cross section ratio has been predicted @xcite to exceed , at very high energy , the value 8  : 9 obtained from su(4 ) and the quark counting rule @xcite .",
    "in addition to these two `` microscopic '' approaches inspired by qcd , calculations are also performed for elastic vector meson production on the basis of multiple pomeron exchange , with the effective pomeron intercept depending on the photon virtuality @xcite .",
    "a stronger increase of the cross section with energy is again predicted than for soft pomeron exchange with @xmath130 .",
    "the data presented here correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2.8  for the  and 3.1  for the  mesons .",
    "they were collected in 1994 using the h1 detector .",
    "hera was operated with 27.5  positrons and 820   protons scattering is included in the   sample ; in this report , _ positrons _ refers both to positrons and electrons . ] .",
    "the detector is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the event final state corresponding to reactions ( [ eq : rh ] ) and ( [ eq : jpsi ] ) consists of the scattered positron and two particles of opposite charges , originating from a vertex situated in the nominal @xmath131 interaction region . in most cases",
    ", the scattered proton remains inside the beam pipe because of the small momentum transfer to the target in elastic interactions .    in the  range studied here ,",
    "the positron is identified as an electromagnetic cluster with an energy larger than 12 gev , reconstructed in the backward electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) and associated with a hit in the proportional chamber ( bpc ) placed in front of it at 141 cm from the nominal interaction vertex ) direction , with respect to which polar angles are measured , is defined as that of the incident proton beam , the backward direction is that of the positron beam . ] .",
    "the bemc covers the polar angles @xmath132 .",
    "its electromagnetic energy resolution is @xmath133% in the energy range of the positrons selected for the present studies .",
    "the bpc angular acceptance is @xmath134 .",
    "the scattered positron polar angle @xmath135 is determined from the positions of the bpc hit and of the interaction vertex .",
    "the trigger used for the present analyses requires the presence of a total energy larger than 10  deposited in the bemc , outside a square of @xmath136 around the beam pipe .",
    "additional cuts , similar to those used for the structure function analysis [ 1a ] , are applied to the hit and cluster position and shape in order to provide high trigger efficiency and good quality positron measurement .",
    "these cuts are complemented by the selection of events with  @xmath0 8 .",
    "the decay pions (  events ) or leptons (  events ) are detected in the central tracking detector , consisting mainly of two coaxial cylindrical drift chambers , 2.2 m long and respectively of 0.5 and 1 m outer radius .",
    "the charged particle momentum component transverse to the beam direction is measured in these chambers by the track curvature in the 1.15 t magnetic field generated by the superconducting solenoid which surrounds the inner detector , with the field lines directed along the beam axis .",
    "two polygonal drift chambers with wires perpendicular to the beam direction , located respectively at the inner radius of the two coaxial chambers , are used for a precise measurement of the particle polar angle .",
    "for the present analyses , two tracks with transverse momenta @xmath137 larger than 0.1 gev / c are required to be reconstructed in the central region of the tracker . for  production , the polar angles must lie in the range @xmath138 , corresponding to particles completely crossing the inner cylindrical drift chamber for interactions at the nominal vertex position . for   production ,",
    "the accepted range is extended to @xmath139 in order to increase the statistics as much as possible while keeping good detection efficiency .",
    "the vertex position is reconstructed using these tracks .",
    "no other track linked to the interaction vertex is allowed in the tracking detector , except possibly the positron track . to suppress beam - gas interactions ,",
    "the vertex must be reconstructed within 30 cm of the nominal interaction point in @xmath140 , which corresponds to 3 times the width of the vertex distribution .",
    "in addition , the accepted events are restricted to the range @xmath141  for  mesons and @xmath142   for  mesons .",
    "the tracking detector is surrounded by a liquid argon calorimeter situated inside the solenoid and covering the polar angular range @xmath143 with full azimuthal coverage . in the case of elastic interactions",
    ", the calorimeters should register only activity associated with the decay particles or the positron",
    ". however , due to noise in the calorimeters and to the small pile - up from different events , elastic  and   production can be accompanied by the presence of additional energy clusters .",
    "these are considered in terms of the variable , defined as the energy of the most energetic cluster which is not associated with a track .",
    "the  distribution shows a peak at small values , attributed mostly to elastic and diffractive interactions , and a broad maximum at higher energies .",
    "the cut  @xmath144 1  is applied to enhance exclusive  production .",
    "this is discussed in section [ sect : mass ] , together with the effect of the cut @xmath144 0.5 .",
    "the sample of events containing a positron and a vector meson candidate includes two main contributions : elastic production ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diag]a ) , defined by reactions ( [ eq : rh ] ) and ( [ eq : jpsi ] ) , and events where the proton is diffractively excited into a system @xmath145 of mass @xmath146 , which subsequently dissociates ( fig . [ fig : diag]b ) .",
    "non - resonant background is also present .",
    "it is possible to identify most of the `` proton dissociation '' events with the components of the h1 detector placed in the forward region @xcite , namely the forward part of the liquid argon calorimeter @xmath147 , the forward muon detectors ( arrays of muon chambers placed around the beam pipe in the proton direction , @xmath148 ) and the proton remnant tagger ( an array of scintillators placed 24  m downstream of the interaction point , @xmath149 ) .",
    "when particles from the diffractively excited system interact in the beam pipe and the collimators , the interaction products can be detected in these forward detectors .",
    "the events are tagged as due to proton dissociation by the presence of a cluster with energy @xmath150 larger than 1  ( 0.75  for the  candidates ) at an angle @xmath151 in the liquid argon calorimeter , or by at least 2 pairs of hits in the forward muon detectors ( one hit pair is compatible with noise ) , or by at least one hit in the proton remnant tagger .",
    "this last criterion is not used for the  events , since they have a flatter  distribution than the  events and would be partially vetoed by the proton tagger .    in order to minimise the effects of qed radiation in the initial state",
    ", the difference between the total energy and the total longitudinal momentum  of the positron and the two particles emitted in the central part of the detector is required to be larger than 45 gev .",
    "if no particle , in particular a radiated photon , has escaped detection in the backward direction ,  should be twice the incident positron energy , i.e. 55 .",
    "the selection criteria for the two samples , supplemented by the mass selections discussed in section [ sect : mass ] , are summarised in table [ tab : sel ] .",
    ".selection criteria for  and  events .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     the choice of the  cut for the  sample is a compromise between the loss of elastic events to which a cluster is accidentally associated in the calorimeter , and the presence of non - resonant background in the final sample .",
    "the loss is estimated using a monte carlo simulation which includes random noise in the calorimeters superimposed on elastic events .",
    "a simulation indicates that 2% of the elastic  events with  @xmath144 0.5   are lost because the proton has acquired sufficient @xmath152 to interact in the beam pipe walls , giving interaction products which are registered in the proton tagger ; this loss is thus  dependent .",
    "for the  sample , 1.5% of the events are lost because of interaction products registered in the forward muon detectors .",
    "another 2% loss for both samples is due to spurious hits in the latter .    in view of the uncertainty on the high mass shape of the resonance ,",
    "the  cross section is quoted in this paper for  @xmath144 1.5 , i.e. @xmath153 .",
    "the uncertainty is larger in the present case than for low energy data , for which a natural cut off is imposed by the limited available energy . with this definition of  resonance production line shape ,",
    "the correction for the mass selection 0.6 @xmath144  @xmath144  1.0  is respectively @xmath154 and @xmath155 for parameterisations ( [ eq : gj ] ) and ( [ eq : gmm ] ) .",

    "the distribution of the target mass @xmath146 is parameterised as @xmath156 .",
    "high mass states are assumed to decay according to the lund string model @xcite or , alternatively , to a final state with particle multiplicity following the kno scaling law and isotropic phase space distribution . in the resonance domain",
    ", the mass distribution follows measurements from @xmath157 dissociation on deuterium @xcite and resonance decays are described according to their known branching ratios .",
    "the decay particles are followed through the beam pipe walls and the forward detectors .    for the  sample , the correction factor for the contamination of undetected proton dissociation events in the selected  sample is @xmath158 .",
    "this number is obtained from the number of measured events tagged and not tagged by the forward detectors , and from the detection probabilities provided by the monte carlo simulation .",
    "no assumption needs to be made for the ratio of proton dissociation to elastic events .",
    "the error is a conservative estimate taking into account the uncertainties on the efficiencies of the forward detectors for tagging proton dissociation events and on the dissociation model .",
    "the correction factor for unobserved proton dissociation background in the selected  sample , for which the proton tagger is not used , is @xmath159 .",
    "the cross section measurements are given in the qed born approximation for electron interactions .",
    "the effects of higher order processes are estimated using the heracles 4.4 generator @xcite .",
    "radiative corrections for the  sample are of the order of 4% after the cut  @xmath0 45 , and are weakly dependent on  and .",
    "a systematic error of 3% is obtained by varying the effective  dependence of the  cross section from @xmath160 to @xmath128 and by modifying the  dependence from a constant to a linearly increasing form structure function '' parameterisation , with the chosen  and  dependences of the @xmath161 cross section for vector meson production . ] .",

    "the present measurements thus lie between the values expected for these two types of models .",
    "the suggestion @xcite that the  cross section measurement may provide information on the gluon distribution in the proton is applicable only when the hard regime is reached .",
    "as this condition does not seem to be fulfilled for the present  and  ranges , an attempt to extract the gluon distribution from these data seems premature .",
    "in contrast , the  production cross section for  @xmath0 8  increases strongly from the fixed target to the hera region .",
    "this increase is of the same order as in photoproduction .",
    "this indicates that a hard regime is reached for  production already at low , which could be related to the smaller spatial extent of the wave function and the large scale provided by the charm quark mass .    a major result of the present measurement is the similarity of the cross sections for  and  elastic production .",
    "whereas  photoproduction , which is suppressed by factors of 100 to 1000 with respect to , is not well described by the `` quark counting rule '' , quark flavour symmetry appears to be approximately restored for  of 10 to 20 .",
    "such a behaviour is expected both in the soft and the hard models . however",

    "the  dependence of the production differential cross sections for  and mesons are found to be well described at low  values by exponential dependences @xmath272 . for the  sample ,  is @xmath273 .",
    "this value is smaller than for photoproduction at hera , showing that the decrease of the slope with rising  observed in fixed target experiments extends to the hera regime .",
    "this behaviour can be attributed to the decrease of the @xmath129 transverse separation in the photon with rising .",
    "the evolution of the slope with  is sensitive to the interplay of soft and hard effects in  production .",
    "there is an indication that the shrinkage of the elastic peak observed in hadron interactions and  photoproduction also occurs in the present electroproduction data , at large .",
    "this is as expected from regge predictions based on soft pomeron exchange , in contrast with the little shrinkage predicted in perturbative calculations for hard processes @xcite .    for  production ,",
    "the  distribution is well described with @xmath274 , which is smaller than for the .",
    "this difference can be qualitatively explained by the fact that the  wave function is more compact than the  wave function .",
    "the  dependence of the  total cross section can be described by a power law @xmath225 , with @xmath226 .",
    "this distribution is slightly harder than initially expected both for non - perturbative two gluon exchange and for hard qcd calculations ( @xmath275 ) .",
    "it is compatible with predictions taking into account the  evolution of parton densities and the transverse motion of the quarks in the photon @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the calculations are performed for @xmath276 whereas the present measurement is of @xmath277 , which includes a transverse contribution at the level of 20@xmath225% , with presumably a steeper  dependence @xcite .",
    "the  dependence of the  production cross section is parameterised as @xmath278 , with @xmath279 , which is similar to fixed target results .",

    ", @xmath280 is @xmath281 .",
    "the increase of  with , which is predicted both by the non - perturbative model and the qcd calculations , is observed .",
    "the indication in the present data of an increase of  with  suggests , in the framework of hard physics , that perturbative features at high  and moderate  are indeed more important for longitudinal than for transverse photons .    in conclusion ,",
    "the study of  and  meson production offers a contrasting picture .    for  mesons ,",
    "hard physics effects are probably at work already for very small .",
    "the present high  data support this interpretation , albeit with limited statistical precision .    for  mesons ,",
    "the , ,  and  dependences of the cross section allow a more detailed study , from which a mixed picture emerges .",
    "it can be speculated that the present data correspond to a transition regime , with interplay of hard processes , amenable to perturbative description , and soft processes , requiring a non - perturbative approach .",
    "the  dependence of the cross section does not provide conclusive evidence in favour of a purely soft or a purely hard model .",
    "the indication of shrinkage of the elastic peak with  is important because it shows a continuation with increasing  of the photoproduction behaviour and is at variance with expectations for a purely hard behaviour .",
    "the observation that su(4 ) flavour symmetry is restored in the  :  cross section ratio , which is a striking feature of the present measurements , is expected in both models .",
