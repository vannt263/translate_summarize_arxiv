    "the discovery of a correlation between spiral arm pitch angle and rotation curve rate of shear ( seigar , block & puerari 2004 , seigar et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) may be a fundamental property of galaxies that is a key in understanding mass distributions .",
    "this is because the rate of shear is related to the slope of the outer part of the rotation curve , which in turn is related to the galaxy mass distribution . in other words",
    ", shear is strongly connected to the central mass concentrations of galaxies .",
    "the shear , @xmath2 , is a dimensionless quantity , and can be measured directly from rotation curves , if one is available .",
    "it is defined as follows , @xmath3 where a is the first oort constant , @xmath4 is the angular velocity and @xmath5 is the velocity at a radius @xmath6 .",
    "the shear rate depends upon the shape of the rotation curve . for a rotation curve that remains flat",
    "@xmath7 , for a falling rotation curve @xmath8 and for a continually rising rotation curve @xmath9 .",
    "as the shape of a rotation curve depends on the mass distribution , the shear rate at any given position depends upon the mass within that radius , or the central mass concentration . as a result ,",
    "the spiral arm pitch angle is dependent upon the central mass concentration , and this is consistent with the expectations of most spiral density wave models ( e.g. bertin et al .",
    "1989a , b ; bertin 1991 , 1993 , 1996 ; bertin & lin 1996 ; fuchs 1991 , 2000 ) , although density wave models predict that pitch angles also depend on stability ( i.e. the toomre @xmath10-parameter ) .",
    "the correlation between shear and spiral arm pitch angles may explain the weak correlations found between properties like bulge - to - disk ratio ( @xmath11 ) , spiral arm pitch angle and hubble type ( e.g.  de jong 1996 ; seigar & james 1998a , b ) .",
    "in these studies the correlations are weak because , even the near - infrared @xmath11 is not a complete picture when it comes to determining the central mass concentration , as the dark matter concentration is not taken into account",
    ". however , a property such as shear is sensitive to the total baryonic and dark matter concentrations .    given the relationship between shear and spiral arm pitch angle ( seigar et al .",
    "2006 ; hereafter paper 1 ) it is possible to determine shear , from imaging data alone , given the equation from paper 1 , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the pitch angle in degrees and @xmath2 is the shear rate .",
    "this relationship opens up a fundamentally new approach for probing mass distributuions in spiral galaxies .",
    "this approach relies on imaging data alone without the need for full rotation curve information .",
    "specifically , the tully - fisher relation ( tully & fisher 1977 ) for spiral galaxies coupled with the shear rate - pitch angle relation can be used to determine a rotation curve normalization _ and _ slope . in this paper",
    "we explicitly demonstrate how , given a bulge - disk decomposition , a pitch angle determination , and a tully - fisher normalizaion , one can constrain galaxy mass distributions , dark matter halo concentrations , and other galaxy formation parameters .",
    "we obtain our constraints within the context of the the standard framework of disk formation put forth by fall & efstathiou ( 1980 ) and blumenthal et al .",
    "( 1986 ) .    in principle",
    ", the technique we demonstrate here and in paper 1 can be applied generally to a large sample of galaxies and to galaxies at high redshift , when spiral arms are detected .",
    "this is the second in a series of papers in which we use spiral arm pitch angles to determine the mass distribution in spiral galaxies . in this paper",
    "we determine mass concentrations in a large sample of disk galaxies from their spiral arm pitch angles ( as this is intrinsically related to their shear rates , i.e.  we determine shear using equation [ shearpitch ] ) , their disk masses and their disk scalelengths ( determined via a bulge - disk decomposition technique ) .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the data we used and the analysis tools .",
    "section 3 describes how we determine the stellar mass distribution in our sample of galaxies .",
    "section 4 describes the dark matter halo density profile models we use and how we determine the halo profiles of our sample of galaxies . in section 5",
    "we present a discussion of our results and in section 6 we provide our main conclusions and present our planned future goals .    throughout this work",
    "we assume a hubble constant of @xmath14 in units of @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 and a cosmology with @xmath17 ( komatsu et al.2009 ) .",
    "the dataset presented in this paper consists of 13 spiral galaxies observed with _",
    "spitzer irac _ at 3.6-@xmath0 m .",
    "these galaxies were chosen as follows : a parent sample ( defined as a southern hemisphere ( @xmath18 ) galaxies with @xmath19 ) of 605 bright galaxies ( ho et al .",
    "2011 ) was selected . from this sample , we then selected all galaxies with observed h@xmath1 rotation curves from persic & salucci ( 1995 ) that also have _ spitzer _",
    "3.6-@xmath0 m imaging data available on the archive .",
    "this results in a sample of 13 galaxies .",
    "we then measure spiral arm pitch angles , and then perform a bulge - disk decomposition , using the spitzer images .",
    "spiral arm pitch angles are measured using the same technique employed by davis et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . a two - dimensional fast - fourier ( 2d - fft ) decomposition technique is used , which employs a program described in schrder et al .",
    "logarithmic spirals are assumed in the decomposition .",
    "the resulting pitch angles are listed in table 1 .",
    "the amplitude of each fourier component is given by @xmath20}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{i}\\sum_{j=1}^{j}i_{ij}(\\ln{r},\\theta)},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are polar coordinates , @xmath23 is the intensity at position @xmath24 , @xmath25 represents the number of arms or modes , and @xmath26 is the variable associated with the pitch angle @xmath13 , defined by @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting pitch angle measured using equation [ fft ] is in radians , and this is later converted to degrees for ease of perception .",
    "the images were first projected to face - on .",
    "mean uncertainties of position angle and inclination as a function of inclination were discussed by considre & athanassoula ( 1988 ) . for a galaxy with low inclination , there are clearly greater uncertainties in assigning both a position angle and anaccurate inclination .",
    "these uncertainties are discussed by block et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and seigar et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who take a galaxy with low inclination ( @xmath28 ) and one with high inclination ( @xmath29 ) and varied the inclination angle used in the correction to face - on .",
    "they found that for the galaxy with low inclination , the measured pitch angle remained the same .",
    "however , the measured pitch angle for the galaxy with high inclination varied by @xmath30% . since inclination corrections are likely to be largest for galaxies with the highest inclinations cases where inclination is @xmath29 are taken as the worst case scenario .",
    "for galaxies with inclination @xmath31 we take into account this uncertainty .",
    "our deprojection method assumes that spiral galaxy disks are intrinsically circular in nature .",
    "the 2d - fft code is then deployed to work on the deprojected images .",
    "the code requires a user - defined inner and outer radius .",
    "the outer radius is chosen as the radius at which spiral structure ( on any galactic structure ) can no longer be seen .",
    "the inner radius is chosen as the innermost radius which excludes any bulge and/or bar structure .",
    "while the outer radius is fairly straightforward to chose , and a slightly incorrect value will not affect the derived pitch angle , the same is not true of the inner radius . if the inner radius is chosen slightly incorrectly , the derived pitch angle can be strongly affected by ( for example ) an inner bar . as a result davis et al .",
    "( 2012 ) employed an iterative routine that chose every possible inner radius from the very central regions of the galaxy out to the user - defined outer radius .",
    "the code then outputs the pitch angle as a function of inner radius for each mode , @xmath32 . for every galaxy",
    ", a range of inner radii always results in a pitch angle that remains approximately constant ( davis et al .",
    "this is the pitch angle that we chose , and the variation of the pitch angle over these radii is a measure of the error .",
    "this region is refered to as the `` stable region '' .",
    "note that the 2d - fft code actually outputs a pitch angle that is either negative or positive based upon their chirality ( davis et al .",
    "for the purpose of this paper , we report the absolute values of the pitch angle .      in this paper , 13 of the galaxies have shear values that were measured directly from their h@xmath1 rotation curves .",
    "the shear was initially calculated in paper 1 and the rotation curves were taken from persic & salucci ( 1995 ) .",
    "these rotation curves are of good quality with an rms error @xmath33 km s@xmath16 , and an error associated with folding the two sides of the galaxy also @xmath33 km s@xmath16 .",
    "these rotation curves have been used to estimate the shear rates in these galaxies , using the same method used by other authors ( e.g. block et al .",

    ". we have chosen to work with only our no - ac models here as we could not rule out one type of model over the other ( i.e. , ac model versus no - ac model ) , and for consistency we chose the pure nfw model here ( i.e. , the no - ac model ) .",
    "furthermore , several papers ( e.g. , kassin et al .  2008a , b ) have shown that ac rarely operates , and that rotation curves can be described without the need for ac .",
    "nevertheless some examples ( e.g. , m31 ) have been shown to require ac ( e.g. , klypin et al .  2002 ; seigar et al .",
    "the virial mass and nfw concentrations resulting from this are listed in table 3 .",
    "the results of our model fits to the observed data are presented in figure 5 , which shows the persic & salucci ( 1995 ) h@xmath1 rotation overlaid with our modeled rotation curves . in all cases the rotation curve is modeled well in the outer parts , where we are measuring the shear . furthermore , in all but one case ( ngc 578 ) , the inner parts of the rotation curve are modeled extremely well .",
    "given the further constraints placed on the nfw concentration parameter ( @xmath86 ) by finding the model that best fits the observed rotation curve ( figure 5 ) , we can now compare this parameter with other properties of the galaxy .",
    "recent results have suggested that there may be a link between the mass of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in galaxy nuclei and the dark halo concentration parameter .",
    "for example , booth & schaye ( 2009 ) explored a potential connection between smbh mass and dark matter halos using a series of simulations .",
    "treuthardt et al .",
    "( 2012 ) developed this further using a combination of imaging data and simulated galaxies , but could not come to any strong conclusions due to a lack of dynamical information .",
    "furthermore , observations of agn ( active galactic nuclei ) in galaxies with little or no bulge , suggest that the dark matter halo concentration may play a role in the determination of smbh mass ( satyapal et al .  2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "these arguments have been used to explain the recent discovery of a correlation between smbh mass and spiral arm pitch angle in disk galaxies ( seigar et al .",
    "2008b ; berrier et al .",
    "if the fundamental factor in determining smbh mass is dark matter halo concentration ( e.g. , ferrarese 2002 ; satyapal et al .  2007 , 2008 ) , then all of the observed relationships naturally follow .",
    "nevertheless it is important to point out that kormendy & bender ( 2011 ) have provided arguments that suggest that the dark matter concentration does not have any direct correlation with the properties of the smbh .",
    "however , their paper did not take into account the theoretical work of booth & schaye ( 2009 ) , which suggests that the smbh growth is regulated by the dark matter halo concentration . shortly after the publication of kormendy & bender ( 2011 ) further observational constraints provided evidence that the smbh mass is correlared with properties of the dark matter halo ( volonteri et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "[ pitchc ]     given the apparent controversy over the link between smbh mass and dark matter concentration , we realized that the parameters we had derived could be used to shed some light on this question . using the concentration parameters",
    "derived by fitting our models directly to the observed rotation curves , we tested the correlation between nfw concentration ( @xmath86 ) and the spiral arm pitch angles of these galaxies , using the fact that pitch angle can be used as a proxy for smbh mass ( seigar et al .  2008b ; berrier et al .",
    "2012 ) . the result can be seen in figure 6 .",
    "note that the nfw concentrations here are derived from our no - ac models , as described in the direct rotation curve fitting above in section 4 .",
    "figure 6 also includes data for m31 ( seigar et al .",
    "2008 ) , m33 ( seigar 2011 ) , and malin 1 ( seigar 2008 ) .",
    "although these authors report that an ac model works best for malin 1 and m31 , for consistency , here we use the concentration parameter for the no - ac model that they used . in the case of m33",
    ", the authors only report a pure nfw concentration .",
    "figure 6 does not show a strong correlation between spiral arm pitch angle ( or smbh mass ) and the nfw concentration parameter .",
    "however , there does appear to be a trend whereby galaxies with very open spirals ( i.e. , with a pitch angle , @xmath90 ) seem to have lower concentrations than those with tightly wound spirals ( with @xmath91 ) .",
    "there is a word of caution however .",
    "the cutoff for the concentration parameter corresponding to this pitch angle is @xmath92 .",
    "for the eight galaxies with @xmath91 , the concentration is in the range @xmath93 .",
    "these are extremely high concentrations .",
    "this range corresponds to a @xmath94 outliers from the expected concentration distribution for large spiral galaxies ( e.g. , bullock et al .",
    "indeed , high concentrations such as these have been used as an argument against a pure nfw dark matter density profile , and instead it has been suggested that in these cases , an adiabatically contracted profile should be adopted ( see for example the case of m31 in seigar et al .",
    "indeed , if we chose to adopt our ac models in these cases ( i.e. , for tight spirals or high concentrations ) , figure 3 shows that there is a tendency for the nfw concentration to decrease .",
    "one should note that this is the initial nfw concentration , but it is in better agreement with the expected distribution of @xmath86 as given by bullock et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , although the halo does become more concentrated due to ac .",
    "in this paper we have examined _ spitzer irac _",
    "3.6-@xmath0 m images of 13 galaxies that have h@xmath1 rotation curves in the literature . using these galaxies",
    "we have shown that :    * the relation between spiral arm pitch angle and rotation curve shear still exists , although with a slightly larger scatter than had been presented in seigar et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . *",
    "using shear ( or pitch angle as a proxy for shear ) as well as a maximum rotation velocity ( or galaxy luminosity as a proxy ) we can constrain various parameters related to the dark matter halo ( e.g. , virial mass , nfw concentration , etc . ) and parameters relating to the total mass concentration of these galaxies .",
    "* there appears to be a weak trend between spiral arm pitch angle and nfw concentration parameter , whereby galaxies with tightly wound arms ( i.e. , @xmath91 ) have particularly high concentrations . for these galaxies",
    "we suggest that ac may play a role , which would help to bring their dark matter concentrations down into a range that is more consistent with dark matter halo simulations for spiral galaxies .",
    "it should be noted that the role of the baryon - dominated central spheroidal component ( i.e. , the bulge ) has remain untouched in this paper .",
    "however , we have shown that we can derive useful dynamical information from imaging data alone ( we can get a maximum rotation velocity from the galaxy luminosity , and we can get the slope of the rotation curve  or shear  from a spiral arm pitch angle ) and in future papers we intend to apply this method to a much larger sample of galaxies .",
    "some forthcoming projects we have in mind are as follows :    * in a recent paper by davis et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we defined a volume - limited sample of southern hemisphere spiral galaxies with a limiting absolute b band magnitude of @xmath95 and a redshift limit of @xmath96 .",
    "we now intend to measure the 3.6-@xmath0 m spiral arm pitch angles of these galaxies , and determine their mass concentrations using the methods described here . we will also investigate whether chosing one exponential scalelength , @xmath52 , rather than @xmath87 for the radius at which shear is measured , significantly affects the best - fitting dark matter halo concentrations ( @xmath86 ) and virial masses ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this may give us some handle on the affect of the bulge component , and therefore tell us something about whether the pitch angles and smbh masses depend on @xmath86 or a combination of @xmath86 and the bulge mass .",
    "this work will be published in paper 3 of this series . *",
    "a fourth ( and final ) paper in this series will measure spiral arm pitch angles of disk galaxies in the goods - s and -n fields .",
    "this will result in a determination of mass concentrations in galaxies as a function of lookback time .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
