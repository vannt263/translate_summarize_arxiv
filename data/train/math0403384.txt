    "historically , one of the amazing theorems in the theory of holomorphic functions of several complex variables is the theorem of hartogs of 1906 about extension of functions from a neighborhood of the boundary of a domain to the inside of the domain .",
    "this theorem was generalized by bochner in 1943 , namely that it is enough to consider @xmath7-smooth functions defined just on the boundary of the domain that satisfy the tangential cauchy - riemann equations . since that time many versions and generalizations of the theorem appeared , _",
    "see _ for instance , kohn - rossi @xcite , ehrenpreis @xcite , ivashkovich @xcite , harvey @xcite , harvey - lawson @xcite , laurent - thibaut @xcite , dolbeault - henkin @xcite , sarkis @xcite , @xcite , and others - for a review see @xcite .",
    "recently , solving the boundary problem in the sense of harvey and lawson for the graph of cr functions defined on boundaries of domains in disc - convex khler manifolds , sarkis @xcite proved extension of cr - meromorphic mappings with values in @xmath2 ( for @xmath8 , @xmath9 , _ see _ @xcite , _ part ii _ ) . as an application , he obtained theorem 1.1 below .",
    "our contribution to this subject essentially lies in a simplification of his proof , as will appear below .",
    "recall that a cr manifold @xmath0 ( locally embeddable or not ) is called _ globally minimal _ if any two points of it can be joined by a piece - wise smooth curve running in complex tangential directions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the result is the following :    let @xmath0 be a compact connected @xmath1-smooth real hypersurface in @xmath2 that divides the projective space into two open parts @xmath5 and @xmath6 . if @xmath0 is globally minimal , then    1 .",
    "there exists a side , @xmath5 @xmath6 , to which every continuous cr function on @xmath0 extends holomorphically .",
    "all holomorphic functions on the other side of @xmath0 which are continuous up to @xmath0 are constant .",
    "theorem 1.1 also holds true ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite , @xcite ) if , instead of a globally minimal @xmath0 as above and instead of cr functions on @xmath0 , we consider an arbitrary @xmath1-smooth hypersurface as above and _ holomorphic functions in a neighborhood @xmath10 of @xmath0 in @xmath2_. our proof is valid in @xmath8 for @xmath11 .",
    "of course , the implication * ( 1 ) * @xmath12 * ( 2 ) * is trivial .",
    "_ summary of the proof .",
    "_  let @xmath13 be a continuous cr function on @xmath0 .",
    "using global minimality , we shall extend @xmath13 to a one - sided neighborhood @xmath14 of @xmath0 in @xmath2 . by deforming @xmath0 into @xmath14",
    ", we shall argue that we can suppose that @xmath0 and @xmath13 are @xmath15-smooth in the assumptions of theorem  1.1 , and even that @xmath13 is holomorphic in a neighborhood of @xmath0 . as the dolbeault cohomology group @xmath16 vanishes for @xmath11 (",
    "_ see _ @xcite , @xcite ) , every @xmath15 cr function @xmath13 on @xmath0 can be decomposed as a jump @xmath17 of some functions @xmath18 , holomorphic on @xmath19 and @xmath15 on @xmath20 .",
    "this decomposition property ( which holds without assuming global minimality ) easily implies that points * ( 1 ) * and * ( 2 ) * from theorem 1.1 are equivalent in the @xmath15 category ( _ see _ lemma  3.1 ) .",
    "afterwards , using a theorem of takeuchi @xcite , we may embed a strip neighborhood of @xmath0 in @xmath21 which then bounds a complex manifold to which @xmath22 _ and _ @xmath23 _ both extend holomorphically _ ( _ see_@xcite and @xcite , _",
    "part i _ ) , and we easily deduce using the maximum principle that either @xmath22 or @xmath23 is constant .",
    "_ open question .",
    "_  in theorem 1.1 , the question arises whether the assumption that @xmath0 is globally minimal can be removed .",
    "this question appears to have deep relations to some well - known conjectures of foliation theory , especially the ( non-)existence of levi flat hypersurfaces in projective spaces .",
    "indeed , every compact cr manifold @xmath24 can be decomposed as a disjoint union of cr orbits .",
    "some of them are of dimension 3 , and the others are of dimension 2 , i.e. , riemann surfaces , which can not be closedly embedded in @xmath0 .",
    "the closure of each such riemann surface defines a non - trivial lamination of @xmath2 and every other riemann surface orbit , having common points with the closure , is dense in this lamination . _",
    "the open question is whether such laminations exist _",
    "( _ cf . _",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath9 ( only )",
    ", this question has been fixed negatively for laminations arising from global foliations of @xmath8 , for real analytic levi - flat hypersurfaces ( _ see _ cerveau @xcite , lins neto @xcite ) and for smooth levi - flat hypersurfaces ( _ see _ siu @xcite ) .",
    "thus , as a part of the folklore , we conjecture that every smooth hypersurface @xmath25 , @xmath11 , is globally minimal .",
    "_ acknowledgement .",
    "_ we are grateful to the referee for his clever support in fixing some incorrections in the manuscript and for having pointed out to us substantial improvements in the proofs .",
    "as we are essentially interested in the geometric approach and not to the best suited regularity assumptions , we shall restrict our attention to the @xmath15-smooth category . by a deformation argument",
    ", we shall see in  3 below that the case where @xmath0 is @xmath1 and the cr function @xmath13 on @xmath0 is only continuous can be reduced to the case where both @xmath0 and @xmath13 are @xmath15 .",
    "we recall that @xmath26 ( for @xmath15-smooth forms ) .",
    "it is easy to deduce :    let @xmath0 be a @xmath15 real hypersurface in @xmath2 dividing it into two open parts @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "every @xmath15-smooth cr function @xmath13 on @xmath0 decomposes as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "we can extend @xmath13 to a @xmath15-smooth function @xmath29 over @xmath2 in such a way that supp@xmath29 lies in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of @xmath0 and @xmath30 vanishes to infinite order .",
    "we define @xmath31 on @xmath3 and @xmath32 on @xmath4 .",
    "the form @xmath33 is a @xmath15-smooth @xmath34-form . as @xmath26",
    ", we can solve the equation @xmath35 with @xmath36 of class @xmath15 .",
    "so we have @xmath37 and furthermore @xmath38 obviously the components of the decomposition are of class @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath15-smooth hypersurface in @xmath2 bounding @xmath5 and @xmath6 as above . as a preliminary to the proof of theorem  1.1 , we may establish an interesting equivalence between * ( 1 ) * and * ( 2 ) * in the @xmath15 category .      1 .",
    "there exists a side , @xmath5 @xmath6 , to which every @xmath15 cr function on @xmath0 extends holomorphically .",
    "2 .   all holomorphic functions on the other side of @xmath0 and @xmath15 up to @xmath0 are constant .    without loss of generality , we can fix @xmath6 to be this side .",
    "assume therefore that every @xmath15-smooth cr function on @xmath0 extends holomorphically to @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath39 .",
    "then the trace @xmath40 extends holomorphically to @xmath6 .",
    "so @xmath41 extends holomorphically to @xmath2 , whence it is constant ; this is * ( 2)*.    conversely , suppose that @xmath42 consists of constant functions only .",
    "let @xmath13 be a @xmath15-smooth cr function on @xmath43 . from lemma  2.1",
    "we obtain that @xmath17 , where @xmath23 and @xmath22 belong to the evident spaces . by hypothesis , @xmath22 is constant .",
    "consequently , the cr function @xmath13 holomorphically extends to @xmath6 ; this is * ( 1)*.    let now @xmath0 be an orientable , @xmath1-smooth , real hypersurface in a complex manifold @xmath44 .",
    "by @xmath14 we denote a _ one - sided _ ( global ) _ neighborhood _ of @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ a connected open set which contains a ( local ) one - sided neighborhood of @xmath0 at each point of @xmath0 and such that @xmath45 , so that @xmath14 contains a neighborhood in @xmath44 of a point @xmath46 whenever it contains the two ( local ) one - sided neighborhoods at @xmath47 .",
    "such one - sided neighborhoods are usually constructed by gluing analytic discs to @xmath0 .",
    "then the side where the discs are lying may of course depend on the point @xmath46 and it may vary effectively if @xmath0 is pseudoconvex somewhere and pseudoconcave elsewhere . without convexity assumption , we have :    ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) let @xmath0 be an oriented globally minimal @xmath15-smooth embedded hypersurface in a complex manifold @xmath44",
    ". then there exists a one - sided neighborhood @xmath14 , constructed by gluing small analytic discs to @xmath0 , to which all continuous cr functions on @xmath0 can be holomorphically extended .",
    "recall that * ( 1 ) * implies * ( 2 ) * trivially .",
    "we prove * ( 1)*. at first , we show that we can assume that @xmath0 and @xmath13 are @xmath15 .",
    "so , let @xmath0 be a compact connected @xmath1 real hypersurface in @xmath2 dividing @xmath2 into two connected open components @xmath6 and @xmath5 and let @xmath13 be a continuous cr function on @xmath0 .",
    "by the theorem above , @xmath13 extends holomorphically to a one - sided neighborhood @xmath14 of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath13 still denote the resulting extension .",
    "let us smoothly deform @xmath0 into @xmath14 .",
    "we get a @xmath15 hypersurface @xmath48 arbitrarily close to @xmath0 and the trace @xmath49 of @xmath13 on @xmath50 defines a @xmath15 cr function ( even better , we could assume that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are real analytic ) .",
    "notice that as global minimality is a stable property under sufficiently small perturbations , the deformed hypersurface @xmath50 can be assumed to be globally minimal also .",
    "again , @xmath50 divides @xmath2 into two open parts @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "suppose that we can show that there exists a side , say @xmath53 , to which every @xmath15 cr function @xmath51 on @xmath50 extends holomorphically . by inspecting the relative geometry of the three open sets @xmath6 , @xmath14 and @xmath53 , and using the fact that @xmath13 is holomorphic in the whole of @xmath14",
    ", we deduce that every continuous cr function @xmath13 on @xmath0 extends holomorphically to @xmath6 . in summary",
    ", it suffices for us to prove theorem  1.1 in the case where both @xmath0 and @xmath13 are @xmath15-smooth .",
    "thus , let @xmath0 be a compact connected @xmath15 real hypersurface of @xmath2 which divides it into two open parts @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath13 be a @xmath15 cr function on @xmath0 and let @xmath54 , @xmath55 be given by lemma  2.1 so that @xmath27 on @xmath0 .",
    "by virtue of lemma  3.1 , it suffices to show that at least one of the two functions @xmath23 or @xmath22 is constant .",
    "we then proceed by contradiction .",
    "assume that @xmath23 _ and _ @xmath22 are both nonconstant . by global minimality , @xmath13 , @xmath23 and @xmath22 can be holomorphically extended to a one - sided neighborhood @xmath14 of @xmath0 constructed by gluing discs .",
    "this open set is in fact a one - sided strip open set , although it is not , in general , a tubular neighborhood of @xmath0 .",
    "however , we can easily deform @xmath0 into @xmath14 in a @xmath15 fashion , getting a @xmath15 hypersurface @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , we can include @xmath57 in a one - parameter family of manifolds @xmath58 , @xmath59 , satisfying    1 .",
    "@xmath60 for all @xmath61 , 2 .",
    "@xmath62 , 3 .   for @xmath63",
    ", we have @xmath64 and @xmath65 . also , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , 4 .",
    "the strip @xmath68 is an open neighborhood of @xmath57 which is contained in @xmath14 .                according to theorem  3.3 and since there exists by assumption the nonconstant function @xmath77 , then @xmath78 separate points .",
    "we can therefore find at least two functions @xmath79 , @xmath80 , such that the zero locus of the jacobian of the mapping @xmath81 is a proper , closed , complex analytic subvariety @xmath82 of @xmath70 of complex dimension @xmath83 .",
    "of course , @xmath84 gives a local coordinate system at each point of @xmath70 not in @xmath82 .",
    "fix @xmath73 with @xmath85 .",
    "let now @xmath86 be arbitrary . then after composing @xmath84 with an automorphism @xmath87 of @xmath2 arbitrarily close to the identity , we obtain that @xmath88 gives a local coordinate system at @xmath47 .",
    "such an automorphism @xmath87 moves @xmath70 a little bit . as @xmath87",
    "can be chosen to be arbitrarily close to the identity , we can insure that the domain of definition of @xmath88 still contains @xmath89 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "let now @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "the above lemma implies that the manifold with boundary @xmath92 is embeddable into some complex euclidean space @xmath21 , @xmath93 , through an embedding @xmath94 whose components are holomorphic functions defined in @xmath76 .",
    "the result of the embedding is a complex _ manifold _",
    "@xmath95 with boundary the three - dimensional maximally complex cr manifold @xmath96 .",
    "notice that @xmath97 also embeds into @xmath21 the closed strip @xmath98 which provides a tubular neighborhood of @xmath57 . by construction , for all @xmath99",
    ", the @xmath100 are oriented maximally complex three - dimensional cr manifolds in @xmath21 .",
    "the orientation on @xmath100 is simply the push - forward of the orientation on @xmath58 .",
    "further , @xmath100 bounds the complex manifold @xmath101 .",
    "finally , the holomorphic function @xmath23 induces a nonconstant holomorphic function on the strip @xmath102 , say @xmath103 . applying a generalization of bochner s theorem ( _ see _ @xcite )",
    ", we deduce that the cr function @xmath104 extends holomorphically to the complex submanifold @xmath101 for all @xmath105 ( the smoothness of @xmath101 is needed , otherwise we could only say that the _ graph _ of @xmath104 extends as a complex analytic set by harvey - lawson s theorem ) .",
    "thanks to the maximum principle , we may now derive the desired contradiction easily .",
    "recall that by assumption , @xmath23 is nonconstant .",
    "therefore , by the maximum principle applied to @xmath23 in the projective space over @xmath6 , we have for all @xmath106 with @xmath107 the strict inequality @xmath108 because @xmath109 and @xmath23 is nonconstant .",
    "but on the other hand , by the maximum principle applied in the complex euclidean space @xmath21 to the nonconstant holomorphic function @xmath110 which extends holomorphically to @xmath95 , we have for all @xmath106 with @xmath107 the reverse strict inequality @xmath111 this gives the desired contradiction , which completes the proof of theorem 1.1 ."
