    "this might be expected in a itinerant magnetic system with long range magnetic order , as has been pointed out by singh et al . for the bacr@xmath0as@xmath0 system.@xcite",
    "experimentally we do not observe any signature of cr moment ordering up to 300  k. this is not surprising considering the large total energy differences between different magnetic cr moment configurations , which suggest an ordering temperature well above the maximum temperature of our measurements .",
    "magnetic measurements at higher temperature are needed to corroborate the expected afm ordering of cr moments .",
    "the calculated magnetic structure of cr moments can be verified experimentally using neutron or x - ray scattering measurements .",
    "finally , we discuss the magnetic order in the eu sublattice .",
    "the calculated total energy for the system is found to be minimum when the interlayer eu spins are antiferromagnetically coupled .",
    "nevertheless , the difference in total energy is very small ( @xmath7 0.0006  ev ) whether the interlayer eu spins are antiferromagnetically coupled or ferromagnetically coupled , implying a rather weak interlayer coupling in the eu sublattice .",
    "so , it is expected that any small external effect ( doping , external pressure or external magnetic field ) can easily flip the eu spin from afm to fm .",
    "the p doped eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 system witnesses a similar weak interlayer coupling ( 0 - 6  mev ) , wherein the antiferromagnetic eu moments arrangement changes from afm to fm with slight change in doping concentration.@xcite furthermore , the homologous system eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 with antiferromagnetic ground state experiences a field - induced spin reorientation to the fm state for an applied field of just 1  t in the @xmath43-plane and at 2  t along the @xmath9-axis,@xcite which suggests a weak afm coupling between the interlayer eu spins . taking into consideration the relatively large interlayer distance between the eu layers along the @xmath9 axis ( 6.44   for eucr@xmath0as@xmath0 , and 6.057   for eufe@xmath0as@xmath0 ) , the interlayer coupling of eu spins in eucr@xmath0as@xmath0",

    "in summary , we have successfully synthesized single and poly crystals of eucr@xmath0as@xmath0 and characterized them using x - ray diffraction , electrical resistivity @xmath6 , magnetization and specific heat @xmath106 measurements .",

    "the @xmath106 and @xmath6 data show anomalies at a temperature @xmath1 = 21  k. while the susceptibility behavior apparently indicates a ferromagnetic order below 21  k , the magnetization data in the ordered state do not show any hysteresis or spontaneous magnetization .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath46@xmath47 obtained from the curie - weiss fit in the paramagnetic state is positive and very close to the magnetic transition temperature .",
    "these observations indicate that the dominant nearest - neighbor ( i.e. intralayer ) eu - eu interaction is fm but there could be a weak or frustrated afm coupling between the layers .",
    "also , we do not rule out the possibility of a fm state of eu@xmath5 moments in eucr@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the measured saturated magnetization for both h@xmath42@xmath43 and h@xmath42@xmath9 are larger than the theoretical value of g@xmath4 = 7.0  @xmath13 per eu atom , suggesting that the cr moments possibly contribute to the observed saturated magnetization values .",
    "the @xmath6 data confirm the metallic state of eucr@xmath0as@xmath0 with a negative magnetoresistance ( -24% ) around the magnetic transition .",
    "the magnetic entropy @xmath107 at @xmath1 is 84% of the theoretical value @xmath3 for @xmath4 = 7/2 of the eu@xmath5 ion and the remaining 16% is recovered by @xmath57 34  k. the electronic structure calculations indicate that the cr ions carry itinerant moment and the most stable magnetic structure in the cr sublattice is a g - type afm order . moreover , the large total energy differences between different magnetic cr moment configurations suggest an ordering temperature well above the maximum temperature of our measurements .",
