    "the interest to the multiphoton cascade transitions in hydrogen during the last decade was triggered by the accurate measurements of the asymmetry in the temperature and polarization distribution of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the launching of the planck surveour enables to perform the measurements with accuracy @xmath3 .",
    "it is a challenge to the theory to perform the calculations of the properties of cmb with the same accuracy . for this purpose",
    "the adequate theory of the cosmological hydrogen recombination should be developed .",
    "the modern theory of this recombination starts from the works by zeldovich , kurt and sunyaev @xcite and by peebles @xcite .",
    "according to @xcite , @xcite the one - photon transitions from the upper levels to the lower ones did not permit the hydrogen atom to recombine , i.e. to reach the ground state .",
    "each photon released in the one - photon transition in atom was immediately absorbed by another atom .",
    "this reabsorption process did not allow the radiations to escape the interaction with the matter .",
    "however if the atom arrives in the @xmath4-state , then it decays via the two - photon transition .",
    "these two photons escape the reabsorption and the recombination occurs .",
    "it was first established in @xcite , @xcite where @xmath5 transition was found to be the main channel for the radiation escape and formation of cmb .",
    "hence the recent properties of the cmb are essentially defined by the two - photon processes during the cosmological recombination epoch .",
    "apart from @xmath5 transition , as it was noted recently in @xcite the two - photon decays from the excited states with the principal quantum number @xmath6 also can contribute at the @xmath7 level of accuracy .",
    "this idea was further developed and intensively discussed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there is a difference between the decay of @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 states and the decay of @xmath4 state .",
    "this difference is due to the presence of cascade transitions as the dominant decay channels in case of @xmath8 @xmath9 , @xmath10 levels . for the @xmath4 level",
    "the cascades are absent .",
    "the cascade photons can be effectively reabsorbed and therefore the problem of separation of the `` pure '' two - photon emission from the cascade photons arises in connection with the escape probability .    a problem of cascade separation appeared to be nontrivial and caused several controversies in the literature .",
    "for the first time this question was raised in @xcite for the two - photon transitions in the two electron highly charged ions ( hci ) .",
    "the same problem was considered later in @xcite . in @xcite , @xcite a general qed approach was developed which allowed for the description of the few - photon cascade transitions .",
    "this approach was based on the f. low theory of the line profile in qed @xcite .",
    "the new interest to cascade separation problem did arise in the context of the cosmological hydrogen recombination .",
    "the ambiguity of this separation was shown in @xcite where it was demonstrated that the contributions of the cascade , `` pure '' two - photon and interference terms can vary depending on the method of calculation and only the total transition rate remains invariant .    the controversies in the cascade description appeared in connection with the cascade regularization methods .",
    "it is convenient to describe these controversies using the simplest example : the two - photon transitions @xmath0 . in hydrogen",
    "we can restrict ourselves with the nonrelativistic theory and only the electric dipole ( @xmath11 ) transitions . in @xmath12 transition",
    "a single cascade @xmath13 should be taken into account .",
    "a total transition rate @xmath14 can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the differential transition rate , @xmath17 is the frequency of one of the emitted photons , @xmath18 .",
    "the differential transition rate @xmath19 consists of three terms : cascade contribution , `` pure '' two - photon contribution and the interference contribution : @xmath20 the cascade contribution can be presented as the sum of the contributions of two cascade links ( resonances ) : @xmath21 where two resonant frequencies are : @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding resonance contributions were presented in @xcite on the basis of the qed approach developed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these contributions look like @xmath24    @xmath25    note that the factor @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) was lost in @xcite which led to the wrong values for @xmath14 , @xmath27 transition rates different from correct ones in the third digit in case of @xmath28 .",
    "this mistake was noticed in @xcite .",
    "here @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the total widths of the levels @xmath28 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 are the one - photon transition rates . in the nonrelativistic limit @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "then , integrating eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , ( [ 5 ] ) over @xmath17 and taking into account eq . ( [ 1 ] ) we find    @xmath36    @xmath37    hence , @xmath38 and @xmath39\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) follows that the deviation of @xmath14 from @xmath29 is quite small ; actually this deviation arrives only in the 5th digit .",
    "a controversy did arise in connection with the regularization of the divergent cascade terms in the integral ( 1 ) . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as in some further papers",
    "the regularization was performed by introducing the widths for the intermediate @xmath40 states , i.e. replacing the energy @xmath41 by @xmath42 .",
    "this replacement was made phenomenologically within the quantum mechanical ( qm ) description . in case of @xmath43 cascade @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the contribution of the resonance 1 instead of eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) looked like @xmath45 while the contribution of @xmath46 remained the same as in eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) . in principle .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) for the cascade transition @xmath43 can be considered as an approximation to eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) since @xmath47 however , s.g .",
    "karshenboim , v.g .",
    "ivanov and j. chluba @xcite insisted that the correct expression for the contribution of the first resonance to the @xmath14 transition rate is eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) but not eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) .    in the present paper",
    "we demonstrate explicitly that our expression ( [ 4 ] ) is exact and the expression ( [ 9 ] ) can be considered only as an approximation .",
    "moreover we prove that the statement made by s.g .",
    "karshenboim et al in @xcite concerning the independence of the two - photon transition rates on the initial state widths , is definitely wrong .",
    "note that we do not deny , in principle , the usefulness of qm approach ; still this approach should be applied with more caution .",
    "all these circumstances require full clarification which will be given in the present paper . completing the introduction we have to stress that the insertion of eq .",
    "( [ 9 ] ) in the integral eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) gives exactly the same result eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) as the insertion of eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "one could think that both methods of regularizations , the qed one applied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the qm one applied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , are equivalent . however , this is not the case for three reasons .",
    "first , this equivalence for the cascade contributions is approximate .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) , ( [ 7 ] ) are valid up to the small corrections of the order @xmath48 . with",
    "the same accuracy holds the mentioned equivalence .",
    "the statement that the cascades do not contribute at all to the radiation escape is also approximate since the cascades can not be separated exactly from the `` pure two - photon '' contribution .",
    "second , the interference contribution also requires regularization and depends on the regularization method .",
    "the integral contributions from the interference terms , unlike the integral cascade contributions are not equivalent for the different regularization schemes .",
    "third , in the astrophysical applications the frequency distributions for the two - photon decays are converted usually with some other functions .",
    "this also violates the equivalence mentioned above .",
    "the total contribution of all the excited states to the radiation escape according to @xcite is about @xmath49 .",
    "thus the error due to the employment of the wrong regularization scheme hardly can exceed @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless having in mind rapidly growing accuracy of the astrophysical measurements of the cmb the development of the accurate qed theory of the processes in hydrogen , connected with the cosmological recombination seems to be necessary .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we start with the qed derivation of the lorentz profile for the one - photon transition from the excited state to the ground state .",
    "this derivation repeats shortly the derivations in @xcite , @xcite but is necessary to introduce the basic formula and notations . as an example",
    "the lyman - alpha transition @xmath50 is considered . in section",
    "iii the two - photon transition rate to the ground state from the @xmath8-state in the presence of cascades is described in general . in section",
    "iv the regularization of the two - photon transition @xmath51 is analysed . for this transition",
    "the qed regularization scheme @xcite , @xcite deviates from the qm approach employed in @xcite-@xcite , @xcite . in section",
    "v the `` pure '' two - photon and interference contribution to the @xmath52 two photon transition rate are described . in section",
    "vi the same derivations are made for the two - photon @xmath53 transition : there is an important difference between @xmath53 and @xmath51 two - photon transitions due to the existence of several cascade channels in case of @xmath53 . in section",
    "vii the 3-photon transitions are analysed with 3-photon decay @xmath54 as an example .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in section viii .",
    "the full qed description of any process in an atom should start with the ground state and end up with the ground state too , i.e. the excitation of the decaying state should be always included .",
    "for the resonant processes , e.g. for the resonant photon scattering the absorption part of the process can be well separated from the emission part , so that the description of the decay process independent on the excitation becomes possible . in this way the theory of the multiphoton processes in atoms was developed in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a simplified version of the theory which starts directly from the excited state was considered in @xcite .",
    "this version allows for the correct description of the complicated multiphoton processes with cascades but does not allow to trace down the details of the regularization of the divergent cascade contributions , i.e. one has to refer to the more elaborate evaluations @xcite , @xcite . since the controversies mentioned above in section i , concern namely the regularization methods , in this work we follow the description formulated in @xcite , @xcite .    having in mind the recombination processes in hydrogen atom we consider first the resonance photon scattering on the ground @xmath55 state with resonances corresponding to the @xmath40 states . in our derivations",
    "we will fully neglect the photons other than @xmath11 which is reasonable for the neutral hydrogen .",
    "it is important to stress that we consider the free atoms which are excited by the photons released by the source which line widths is comparable ( or larger ) then the natural line widths of the resonance atomic state .",
    "thus we exclude the special cases of the excitation by the laser with the narrow bandwidths or something equivalent",
    ". our condition ( broad source width ) should correspond the cosmological recombination situation when every atom is excited by the photons emitted by another atom .",

    "the photon frequency @xmath78 is close to the energy difference between two atomic levels . in case of @xmath40 resonance @xmath79 .",

    "( [ 17 ] ) @xmath81    eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) reveals that in the resonance approximation the scattering amplitude is factorized into an emission and absorption parts .",
    "the energy denominator should be attached to the emission or absorption part depending on what we want to describe : emission or absorption process .",
    "in particular , the first - order emission amplitude can be expressed as @xmath82    the nonresonant corrections to the resonance approximation , first introduced in @xcite were recently investigated in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the role of these corrections appeared to be negligible in most cases .",
