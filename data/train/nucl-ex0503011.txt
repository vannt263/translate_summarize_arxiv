    "hadronic decay daughters of resonances which decay inside the medium may also scatter with other particles from the medium . for sps and rhic energies these are mostly pions .",
    "this results in a signal loss , because the reconstructed invariant mass of the decay daughters no longer matches that of the parent .",
    "leptonic decay daughters on the other hand are unaffected by the nuclear medium due to their small interaction cross section .",
    "the rescattering and regeneration ( pseudo - elastic ) processes for resonances and their decay particles depend on the individual cross sections and are dominant after chemical but before the kinetic freeze - out .",
    "these interactions can result in changes of the reconstructed resonance yields , momentum spectra , widths and mass positions .",
    "rescattering will decrease the measured resonance yields while regeneration will increase them .",

    "they are therefore better able to describe the rescattering and regeneration of the resonances from fireball interactions .",

    "comparisons between the yield and momentum spectra of the hadronic and leptonic decay channels can indicate the magnitude of the rescattering and regeneration contribution between chemical and thermal freeze - out . in order to try to understand the medium effect during the evolution and expansion of the hot and dense fireball , we compare resonance yields and spectra ( width and mass ) from elementary p+p and heavy ion collisions and the results from the leptonic and hadronic decay channels .",
    "an observed difference may give an indication of in - medium modification of resonance properties .",
    "the signal loss due to rescattering is caused by the method of measurement , the invariant mass is not properly reconstructed if one of the decay daughters rescatters with another particle of the surrounding medium .",

    "microscopic calculations ( urqmd ) estimate a suppression of 20 - 30% of the @xmath4(1020 ) yield in the hadronic decay channel due to rescattering of the kaon decay daughters in the low momentum region p@xmath22  @xmath32  1  gev @xcite .",
    "the rescattering is negligible for the leptonic decay due to the very low cross section of interaction with the hadronic phase .",
    "therefore the lower signal in the low momentum region of the hadronic decay ( na49 ) compared to the leptonic decay ( na50 ) is in agreement with the model .",
    "however the signal loss of 20 - 30% from the model calculation is not sufficient to explain the factor of 4  @xmath13  2 in the measured yield of the data .",

    "alternative calculations to describe in medium modification of the @xmath4(1020 ) resonance were published recently by k. haglin and e. kolomeitsev @xcite . here",
    "the lifetime of the @xmath4(1020 ) resonance is modified towards smaller lifetimes due to modification of the spectral functions in the hot and dense fireball and therefore more of the @xmath4(1020 ) resonances decay inside the medium .",
    "this will introduce a larger signal loss due to rescattering of the hadronic decay daughters .",
    "finally i would like to conclude with a small remark . if we interpret particle spectra of ground state particles we have to take into account that a large fraction of the particles are coming from resonance feeddown , as already pointed out by e. schnedermann et al .",
    "for the proton we have 42% from @xmath2 s , 21% from @xmath12 s , and 11% from @xmath33 s ( statistical model @xcite ) . therefore only 26% of the protons are primary produced protons .",
    "35% of the @xmath2 s are from @xmath8(1385 ) and 20% from @xmath33 s ( statistical model ) decays . if we take the contribution of multiple rescattering and regeneration processes during the expansion of the fireball source into account , the number of primary particles will be further reduced , because the regeneration does not necessarily involve the actual resonance decay particles . since the lifetimes of the @xmath20 and @xmath12(1232 ) are very short compared to the lifetime of the fireball , we would expect a larger number of @xmath6 s and protons coming from a @xmath12(1232 ) decay than from higher mass baryons .",
    "therefore many @xmath6 s and protons are coming from a later stage of the evolution of the fireball source and their momentum distribution might be different from the primary produced particles .",
    "conclusions based on the momentum distributions of particle spectra in terms of flow and freeze - out temperatures have to take the contribution from resonance decays into account .",
