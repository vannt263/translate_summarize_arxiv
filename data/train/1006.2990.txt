    "the motion of electrons in a periodic potential under a constant external force is one of the fundamental phenomena of solid - state physics and treated in many text books  @xcite .",
    "bloch oscillations  @xcite and transitions between energy bands via landau  zener tunneling  @xcite are important effects discussed in this context .",
    "they have been studied in many different contexts , like electrons in semiconductor superlattices  @xcite , optical waves in photonic lattices  @xcite , and bose  einstein condensates in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the latter allow a particularly high degree of control over various system parameters .",
    "in the present work , we consider a two - band tight - binding model with an additional tilting force and study the force - induced coupling between the two bloch bands .",
    "this has been an active area of research for quite some time , although mainly focused on electronic motion in superlattices  @xcite . for ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices",
    "@xcite , nearly closed two - band systems are also realisable using different techniques as described , e.g. , in  @xcite .",
    "besides the possibility of experimental realisation , a closed two - band model is also interesting as a simple model system . here , we discuss the two lowest energy bands of an optical lattice @xmath0 , with the wave vector of the optical lattice @xmath1 .",
    "all energies are measured in units of the recoil energy @xmath2 and we set @xmath3 .",
    "this has the advantage , that all parameters of the model hamiltonian depend only a single quantity , the depth of the optical lattice @xmath4 , and can easily be computed  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : parameters ] shows this dependence of the hamiltonian parameters for different values of @xmath4 . in the following , we consider the external stark force @xmath12 as a free parameter and our focus will lie on the oscillations between the two bloch bands .",
    "we start by changing to fourier space in two steps : first we remove the force term in the time - dependent schrdinger equation by performing a gauge transformation and in a second step we will switch to momentum space .",
    "the applied force breaks the translational invariance of the system which can be restored by changing to the interaction - picture with respect to the external force  @xcite , such that the stark term is absent but momentum @xmath13 is replaced by @xmath14 and the system is explicitly time - dependent .",
    "we introduce fourier components @xmath15 and obtain from the original non - interacting two - band model the following time - periodic two - level hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath16 the spectrum at fixed time is shown in fig .",

    ". please note , that our model is slightly different from a tight - binding superlattice , as e.g. in  @xcite , since we include a local on - site coupling of the bands .",

    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) and  ( [ eq : schroedinger ] ) .",
    "a formal solution of eq .  ( [ eq : schroedinger ] ) is given by @xmath31 \\binom{\\tilde a(k,0)}{\\tilde b(k,0)},\\ ] ] where @xmath32 denotes time - ordering .",

    "@xcite , it can be solved approximately by dropping the time - ordering ( valid to first order in @xmath33 ) . choosing occupation in the lower band only as initial state , i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath35 , one obtains for the occupation of the upper band @xmath36 with @xmath20 $ ] as above .",
    "unfortunately , this integral can not be expressed in simple terms of elementary functions , but has to be treated in different levels of approximation or numerically .",
    "to obtain an idea of the physics contained in the above expression , we stick to some simple approximation and will find signs of resonances in this system .",
    "writing @xmath37 and using the addition theorems , we find integrands of the form @xmath38 and @xmath39 which are not accessible .",
    "we therefore expand the functions in fourier series @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes the ordinary bessel function of order  @xmath42 . taking only the first terms ,",

    "thus , a truncated fourier expansion indicates the existence of resonances in the occupation of the upper band for @xmath45 , that is for values of the external force where the tilt between sites of different bands equals the band gap . to test this expectation , we evolved an initial state with @xmath34 and @xmath46 in time for a resonant value and the resulting occupation of the upper band @xmath47 is shown in fig .",

    "it clearly demonstrates the existence of resonances in our system .",
    "the occupation of the upper band is usually very small , of the order of a few percent , but shows sharp resonances for @xmath49 .",
    "a closer numerical study ( not shown here ) shows a lorentzian shape for the lower order resonances and the possibility of more complicated , fano - like shapes for the narrower higher order resonances .",
    "the non - resonant oscillations are well described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rabi ] ) , compare also fig .  [",
    "fig : resonances ] . below",
    "we will derive an effective model for the system in resonance that allows a quantitative prediction of the resonance width .",
    "similar resonant behaviour has been observed in extensive numerical studies of the occupation of minibands for electronic motion in superlattices  @xcite .",
    "having found resonances in the system , we are now going study this resonant behaviour in more detail . starting from the original hamiltonian in coordinate space , eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) , we apply a transformation known  @xcite to diagonalise the single band problem    [ eq : trafo ] @xmath50    where we defined @xmath51 and @xmath52 . using properties of bessel functions , we arrive at @xmath53 .",

    "this means the coupling between different and possibly remote sites , which is originally mediated by on - site coupling and subsequent hoppings , can be considered a higher order process in the original basis .",
    "but in the transformed basis eq .",

    "( [ eq : schroedinger ] ) .",
    "one has to solve the larger but time - independent eigenvalue problem for the floquet operator @xmath55 having matrix elements @xmath56 this is based on expanding the hamiltonian in a fourier series with fourier components @xmath57 . in our case",
    "these fourier components are 2@xmath582 matrices and read explicitly    @xmath59    with the signum function @xmath60 .",
    "the obtained floquet hamiltonian @xmath55 is the same as obtained earlier in eq .",

    "( [ eq : htransformed ] ) can be solved exactly as before , cf .",
    "( [ eq : rabi ] ) .",
    "the argument of the bessel functions is zero for @xmath62 and only on - site coupling of the two bands remains . when the system is exactly in resonance",
    ", there is a degeneracy between two energy levels of the two bands and the most relevant coupling in the transformed basis , is the direct one between these two levels . taking only this coupling , we arrive at an effective rabi problem  @xcite . in a resonance of order @xmath63",
    ", this reduces to a simple 2@xmath582-matrix : @xmath64 the occupation of the upper band follows a simple rabi formula @xmath65 with a rabi frequency for the resonant oscillations given by @xmath66 .",
    "this frequency is much smaller than the bloch frequency @xmath67 and the corresponding periods are given by @xmath68 thus , the system in resonance exhibits oscillations between the two bands of an amplitude close to unity and on a time scale much larger than the direct on - site oscillations .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : trabi ] we compare this predictions to numerical simulations for different values of the parameters in the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : h0 ] ) , and different orders of resonance .",
    "we observe very good agreement .",
    "additionally , the inset shows the relative error between the predicted and numerically observed values .",
    "it is approximately 5  % for the widest resonance @xmath69 , but smaller than 3  % for higher resonances and slightly decreasing with increasing potential depth .",
    "we want to compare these results to nearly degenerate perturbation theory in the original basis . here",
    ", the resonances of different order have to be treated separately . starting with the first order resonance ( @xmath70 )",
    ", one finds in second order degenerate perturbation theory a rabi frequency of @xmath71 reproducing the leading order result of @xmath72 . for the second order resonance ( @xmath73 ) , one obtains in third order degenerate perturbation theory @xmath74 , slightly differing from the leading order behaviour of the result in the transformed basis .",
    "higher order resonances can be computed in a similar fashion , but the resonant basis  ( [ eq : trafo ] ) is clearly a better starting point for further calculations . indeed , considering the mean occupation of the upper band close to a resonance , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rabitransformed ] ) , we find a breit - wigner shape for the resonances as also seen numerically  @xcite , namely @xmath75 where @xmath76 and the width of the resonances is accordingly given by @xmath77 .",
    "comparing to numerical simulations ( not shown here ) , the effective model presented here gives a good estimate for the magnitude of the resonance width .",
    "in particular , the width decreases very quickly with the order of the resonance or the depth of the optical lattice , since @xmath78 where the factor @xmath79 is of order one ( for @xmath80 ) , but since @xmath81 , the last factor decreases very rapidly .",
    "we do not compare these values with results from numerical calculations in more detail here .",
    "higher accuracy can be obtained by degenerate perturbation theory in the resonant basis .",
    "we studied oscillations in a two - band tight - binding model .",
    "we could reduce the problem of solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation to a whittaker  hill equation and concentrated on different physical regimes for the inter - band oscillations .",
    "we found and discussed resonances in the system and derived an effective model for the system in resonance allowing a quantitative characterisation of the resonances themselves and the time - scales of inter - band oscillations .",
