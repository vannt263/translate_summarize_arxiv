    "both galactic black holes ( gbh ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , being black hole accretion systems , share a number of similarities in their spectroscopic and variability features despite being separated by several decades in mass .",
    "the major ingredients of the two systems appear to be an optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk emitting thermal radiation , and an optically thin hot ` corona ' emitting x - ray emission with a power - law spectrum . because the temperature of the disk scales with the black hole mass as @xmath3 , the thermal disk emits in the soft x - rays for gbhs , and in the optical / uv region for agn .",
    "the source and geometry of the corona emission is not known , but likely involves inverse compton emission from a hot electron plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a possible synchrotron contribution from a jet @xcite .",
    "both gbhs and agn follow a correlation between the black hole mass , radio luminosity , and x - ray luminosity @xcite , leading some to suggest that the systems are largely self - similar , at least in low accretion rate states , differing only in mass and environment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the comparison between gbhs and agns is not straightforward , as gbhs are known to exist in different ` states ' , with the same source seen cycling between the various states ( for a review see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the spectral and timing properties of gbhs are different in the different states .",
    "the most commonly observed states are the hard , soft , and very high state ( vhs ) . in the hard state ,",
    "the spectrum is dominated by the power - law hard x - ray emission , while in the soft state the x - ray flux increases and the spectrum contains a significant thermal disk component . in the vhs ,",
    "the x - ray flux is very high and the spectrum is intermediate in hardness between the soft and hard states .",
    "the power spectral density ( psd , @xmath4 ) of the x - ray fluctuations can be reasonably approximated by bending power - laws , @xmath5 . for the soft and intermediate states",
    ", the power - law component contributes to the majority of the variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while for the hard state the disk blackbody component dominates the soft x - ray variability , at least on time scales @xmath6 sec @xcite .",
    "the psd at high frequencies has a logarithmic slope @xmath7 , flattening to a slope of @xmath8 below some break frequency .",
    "for gbh in the hard state and vhs , there is an additional flattening to @xmath9 below a second lower break frequency , with the break frequencies being higher in the vhs .",
    "the accretion rate increases as one moves from the hard state to the vhs .    for agn",
    "the situation is less clear , due to the fact that the time scales involved for the state transitions are expected to scale upwards with black hole mass . as such , agn , with their supermassive black holes ( smbh ) ,",
    "have not been observed to unabmiguously undergo state transitions .",
    "many agn display seds more characteristic of soft state gbh , in that there is a strong thermal component from the disk in the optical / uv region .",
    "@xcite suggest , based on comparisons of the agn and gbh seds , that most agn in current surveys are in the vhs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "almost all of the @xmath10 agn with high quality x - ray lightcurves exhibit psds similar to those seen in cyg x-1 in the soft state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the only exception is akn 564 , which exhibits a second low - frequency break @xcite .",
    "the high accretion rate ( @xmath11 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) led @xcite to suggest that this source is analagous to the vhs .",
    "however , the average 210 kev photon index of these sources is @xmath12 @xcite , which resembles the value observed for gbhs in the hard state ; thus , there is some descrepancy between the spectral and timing classifications .",
    "the break frequencies for both gbhs and agn are observed to anti - correlate with black hole mass @xcite , further strengthening the similarity between gbhs and agn .",
    "the anti - correlation between the break frequency and black hole mass has typically been interpreted as being driven by a correlation between the size of the x - ray emitting region and black hole mass .",
    "a number of studies have also found an anti - correlation between the amplitude of x - ray variability and @xmath13 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the absence of agn analogous to the hard state suggests that selection effects may be at work , as all gbhs with accretion rates less than a few per cent of eddington are hard state objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while most agn surveys have only been able detect objects radiating at @xmath14 in large numbers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while studies of agn variability have many complications , they do have the advantage that the disk and corona emission can be cleanly separated .",
    "in contrast , for gbh in the soft state the seperation is more difficult as both components emit in x - rays , and the disk component does not exhibit significant variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "therefore , studies of the disk emission variability are more easily carried out for agn .",
    "previous studies of agn optical variability using well - sampled lightcurves have found that the optical variations have dispersions of @xmath10@xmath15 @xcite , with the x - rays varying more on the shorter time scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and sometimes also on the longer time scales @xcite .",
    "in addition , the optical psd can be well described by a power law form @xmath16 @xcite , or , when the lightcurve is long enough , by a lorentzian centered at zero @xcite ; i.e. , the psd is @xmath17 , flattening to a constant below some break frequency .",
    "similar to the x - ray psd , the break frequency of the optical psd increases with black hole mass @xcite , although not as steeply .",
    "while variability studies of agn and gbhs have been important for understanding the similarities between these two classes of objects , variability studies are important for other reasons as well .",
    "for one , variability is one of the only observational tools available for probing the disk viscosity , as the time scales of variability are expected to depend on viscosity , while the sed is not @xcite .",
    "understanding the disk viscosity is important for understanding the transfer and removal of angular momentum in the disk , which is fundamental to an understanding of the accretion flow .",
    "variability is also a potentially important observational tool for constraining the geometry of the corona , with , for example , studies of quasi - periodic oscillations being consistent with the disk evaporating into a hot inner flow at lower accretion rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the origin of the variability in the qpos being in the hot corona in the soft state and the disk in the hard state ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is also consistent with the finding of @xcite who showed that the disk is responsible for much of the variability in the hard state ; however , there is still much work to be done , as it has not been conclusively shown that the source of variability originates in the same region as the emission .",
    "in addition , variability may be the most effective observational discriminator between the different accretion states , and thus may provide evidence of radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) in agn , which are believed to be associated with the hard state , should a hard state exist for agn .",
    "a number of riaf candidates exist ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but their spectral / timing state is unknown . studies and confirmation of agns in the hard state are particularly important , as the hard state is associated with jet production in gbhs ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and mechanical feedback from these jets plays an important role in heating intracluster gas and regulating the growth of massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "time series exhibiting psds of a @xmath18 type are known as long - memory processes , and there is an extensive literature on them ( e.g. , a good reference is * ? ? ?",
    ". almost all previous studies of variability in gbhs and agn have relied on non - parameteric techniques , such as the periodogram or the structure function .",
    "however , there are a number of known difficulties in estimating the psd or structure function non - parameterically ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for one , the empirical estimate of the psd , known as the periodogram , suffers from windowing effects due to the finite sampling of the lightcurve .",
    "these windowing effects include red noise leak and aliasing , which are caused by power leaking into the periodogram from time scales longer and shorter than the maximum and minimum time scales probed by the lightcurve , respectively .",
    "red noise leak and aliasing distort the periodogram , making it potentially difficult to relate the observed periodogram to the true intrinsic psd .",
    "moreover , irregular sampling further distorts the periodogram , although this distortion can be alleviated through the use of the lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite .",
    "the structure function is not immune to these problems and can similarly be distorted , making its interpretation difficult @xcite .",
    "these distortion problems can be significant for agn especially , as their observed flux is often much fainter than gbhs and their lightcurves tend to be more irregular and sparsely sampled .",
    "motivated by these problems , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) developed a powerful monte carlo technique for estimating the underlying psd which accounts for the distorting effects of finite , and possibly irregular , sampling .",
    "the basic idea behind the technique is to use monte carlo simulations to calculate the expected value of the periodogram as a function of the true underlying psd , and then to find the true psd which minimizes a @xmath19 goodness of fit measure between the observed periodogram and the expected one .",
    "construction of confidence regions may be obtained through the procedure outlined by @xcite .",
    "this technique has the advantage that it may be used to fit any arbitrary psd .",
    "however , it also has two disadvantages .",
    "first , it is computationally intensive , especially when constructing confidence regions .",
    "second , the @xmath19 goodness of fit statistic used to fit the psds ignores the covariance in the periodogram among the frequency bins , and is not proportional to the log - likelihood of the periodogram . as such , minimization of the @xmath19 statistic of @xcite , while effective , is unlikely to be the most efficient means of constraining the underlying psd .",
    "an alternative bayesian approach based on an approximation to the likelihood function of the periodogram has been developed by @xcite .",
    "an additional likelihood - based approach has been developed by @xcite with the difference being that the likelihood function is calculated in the time domain .",
    "unfortunately these two alternative approaches do not completely incorporate the distortion in the psd due to finite sampling of the lightcurve , such as that caused by red noise leak , although in principle the psd model used by @xcite can be modified to correct for this .",
    "indeed , it is very difficult to derive an analytic expression for the likelihood function of the periodogram for a finite and irregularly sampled lightcurve , and in many cases may be impossible .    an alternative and complementary approach to fourier - based techniques is to model the lightcurve as a parameterized stochastic process , with the parameters of the model being related to the underlying psd ( or rather , the psd being a function of the parameters of the process ) . under this approach ,",
    "the parameters of the model are estimated directly from the lightcurve itself ; no fourier transforms are performed , and thus there is no spectral distortion . moreover , modeling the lightcurve in the time domain potentially can provide further insight on features in the power spectrum , such as break frequencies , as it is not always apparent how to interpret the psd .",
    "time - domain modeling was advocated for by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kbs09 , see also @xcite and @xcite ) within the context of estimating the characteristic time scale of agn optical variability ( or equivalently , the break frequency of the optical psd ) , and they developed a bayesian approach for estimating the parameters .",
    "kbs09 modeled agn optical lightcurves as gaussian ornstein - uhlenbeck ( ou ) process , the power spectrum of which is a lorentzian centered at zero , and showed that this process is consistent with the optical lightcurves of agn for their sample .",
    "subsequent work has confirmed that the ou process provides a good description of agn optical variability , at least on time scales between a few days and several years @xcite , and of blazar sub - mm variability @xcite .",
    "moreover , the ou process provides a framework in which to measure the time lags between the agn broad line region and optical continuum @xcite and select quasars @xcite .    in this work",
    "we extend the method of kbs09 to enable more flexible modeling of the psd of accreting black hole systems .",
    "we model the lightcurves as a linear expansion of ou processes , which enable us to approximate many of the features seen in the psds of gbhs and agn , particularly the bending power - law forms .",
    "we derive the likelihood function for this statistical model and perform statistical inference within a bayesian framework , thus enabling one to calculate the probability distribution of the parameters , such as the break frequencies , given the data .",
    "because our method is based on the likelihood function , it uses all of the information in the data .",
    "furthermore , it fully accounts for measurement errors , irregularly sampling , red noise leak , and aliasing .",
    "fitting is performed on the entire lightcurve simultaneously regardless of the sampling , thus enabling one to easily combine lightcurves obtained from different instruments and sampling time scales .",
    "these properties make our technique particularly attractive for obtaining constraints on psd features for poorly sampled lightcurves of faint objects , as our bayesian method uses all of the information in the data .",
    "calculation of the likelihood function is computationally efficient , and we are able to calculate a maximum - likelihood estimate of the psd in under a minute .",
    "the primary disadvantage of our method is that , while flexible , it can not fit arbitrary psds ; for this , one should use the method of @xcite , or a combination of the two techniques .    while the ou process , and similarly the mixture of ou processes , is useful for fitting psds , and thus quantifying variability , it is not always clear how to interpret the best - fit ou process astrophysically , or the psd in general .",
    "@xcite studied the linear diffusion equation for an accretion disk with a driving noise term as a model for the psds of accreting black holes , showing that features in the psd depend on the viscosity of the accretion flow . in this work",
    "we will show how the mixture of ou processes arises as the solution to the linear diffusion equation , perturbed by a random spatially - correlated white noise field .",
    "this interpretation of the mixed ou process may be considered to be among the ` perturbation ' class of astrophysical models for variability of gbhs and agn , with the variability arising from small random accretion rate perturbations that propagate inwards through the accretion flow , making the observed variations the product of perturbations that occurr at larger radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the perturbation class of models for variability also explains the correlation between flux and absolute rms variability seen in both gbhs and agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which @xcite show is very well approximated as being due to a gaussian process on the logarithmic scale .",
    "finally , we note that the perturbation class of models for variability is only applicable to the broad - band flickering noise seen in gbh and agn lightcurves , and we do not address the more catastrophic , and seemingly not stochastic , changes that have been observed in the lightcurves of grs 1915 + 105 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". these may occur due to accretion disk instabilities , such as radiation pressure instabilities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the thermal - viscous ionization instability @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we stress that the astrophysical interpretation of the mixed ou process as a model for the fluctuations from gbhs and agn is based on the linear diffusion equation , which is surely an oversimplification , and mhd simulations must be performed for studying more physically motivated models for variability of accreting black holes , as done by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "rather , we study the mixed ou process as a solution to the stochastic linear diffusion equation in order to provide a guide for interpreting the best - fit model and psd features of lightcurves , both real and simulated , as analytical solutions may be obtained .",
    "the format of the paper is as follows : in   [ s - smodel ] we describe the mixed ou process statistical model for the lightcurves of gbhs and agn . in   [ s - oudiff ]",
    "we show that the mixed ou process is generically the solution to the linear diffusion equation . in   [ s - likhood ]",
    "we derive the likelihood function of the mixed ou process parameters , and posterior probability distribution of the parameters given an observed lightcurve . in   [ s - apply ]",
    "we apply the mixed ou process to an x - ray lightcurve of cygnus x-1 in the low / hard state , the x - ray lightcurves of 10 local well - studied agn , and the optical lightcurves of a sample of agn .",
    "finally , in   [ s - summary ] we summarize our results .",
    "in this section we give a brief overview of the properties of the ou process that are relevant for our work .",
    "further details can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite and @xcite ) , who refer to this process as a first - order continuous autoregressive process .",
    "the ou process , @xmath20 , is a simple stochastic process by which the quantity of interest ( say , the logarithm of the luminosity or accretion rate ) responds to an input noise process with an exponential decay to its mean .",
    "mathematically , the ou process is defined by the following stochastic differential equation : @xmath21 the parameters of the process are the characteristic frequency , @xmath22 , the mean value of the process , @xmath23 , and the amplitude of the driving noise process , @xmath24 .",
    "the term @xmath25 has units of @xmath26 , and thus @xmath24 gives the rate at which variability power is injected into the stochastic process @xmath20 .",
    "the term @xmath27 denotes a wiener process ( i.e. , a brownian motion ) , and its derivative is white noise .",
    "although in this work we will focus on the special case when @xmath27 is a wiener process , the results outlined here for the ou process , such as the form of its psd , are valid for a more general class of stochastic processes called lvy processes . for completeness",
    ", we give a brief description of lvy processes in the appendix .",
    "it is apparent from setting @xmath28 in equation ( [ eq - ou ] ) that @xmath20 decays to its mean value with an @xmath29-folding time scale of @xmath30 .",
    "the time scale @xmath31 is often called the relaxation time scale of the process ; in this work we will refer to @xmath31 as the characteristic time scale of the process , as @xmath31 is related to the break frequency in the power spectrum of @xmath20 .",
    "when the driving noise , @xmath32 , is white , the ou process is stationary and markov .",
    "a stationary process is one whose joint probability distribution does not change when shifted in time , and a markov process is one whose future states only depends on the current state . in addition , if @xmath27 has zero mean and unit variance the autocovariance function of the ou process is @xmath33 it follows from setting @xmath34 in equation ( [ eq - rou ] ) that the variance of the ou process is @xmath35 , and that the autocorrelation function has an exponential decay with @xmath30 being the decorrelation time scale .",
    "the power spectrum of the ou process is given by the fourier transform of the autocovariance function : @xmath36 the power spectrum of an ou process is flat for frequencies @xmath37 , and decays as @xmath38 for frequencies @xmath39 .",
    "hence the association of @xmath31 as a characteristic time scale of the process : the ou process , @xmath20 , resembles white noise on time scales long compared to @xmath31 , and resembles red noise on time scales short compared to @xmath31 .",
    "note that if one calculates the power spectrum in terms of ordinary frequencies instead of angular frequencies , then @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "this implies that simply fitting the break in the power spectrum as a function of ordinary frequency @xmath42 will overestimate @xmath31 by a factor of @xmath43 .",
    "we can build on the ou process to develop more flexible models that enable modeling of more complex power spectra . in this work we consider a mixture of ou processes with independent driving noises for constructing a process with a power spectrum of the form exhibited by the x - ray lightcurves of gbh and agn .",
    "we define a discrete mixture of ou processes as @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is a set of mixing weights , and @xmath46 is a set of ou processes with characteristic frequencies @xmath47 and driving noise amplitudes @xmath48 . a continuous version of equation ( [ eq - mixou_disc ] ) is described in the appendix , although we do not use it in this work .",
    "the autocovariance function of @xmath49 is @xmath50 where we have used the fact that @xmath51 .",
    "the sum of exponentials in equation ( [ eq - rmixou_disc ] ) falls off more slowly than a single exponential function , and therefore the autocorrelation function of the mixed ou process falls off more slowly than the autocorrelation function of the individual ou processes .",
    "in other words , the mixed ou process exhibits longer range dependency than a single ou process , and therefore is better suited for modeling lightcurves with long time scale dependencies .",
    "the power spectrum of @xmath49 is @xmath52 from equations ( [ eq - rmixou_disc ] ) and ( [ eq - pmixou_disc ] ) it is apparent that the contribution of an individual ou process to the variability amplitude of a lightcurve depends on the product @xmath53 , and thus the two parameters are degenerate .",
    "therefore , for simplicity in this work we only consider the case where all of the individual ou processes have the same value of @xmath24 .    in figure [ f - mixou_illust ] we plot a mixed ou process sampled at the three different time intervals .",
    "the mixing weights for this example were chosen such that the power spectrum of the simulated lightcurve was flat below a low - frequency break , @xmath54 , decays as @xmath18 above the low - frequency break , and then steepened to @xmath55 above a high - frequency break , @xmath56 , similar to what is seen in the x - ray lightcurves of accreting black hole systems .",
    "thus , the simulated lightcurves probe the ` white ' noise , ` pink ' noise , and ` red ' noise regions of the psd .",
    "we constructed these lightcurves assuming that the logarithm of the flux follows a mixed ou process with @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and that the driving noise is gaussian white noise .",
    "in general , we model the logarithm of the flux as a gaussian mixed - ou process , as this is consistent with the flux - rms correlation seen in the x - ray variations of gbhs and agn @xcite and the log - normal distribution of fluxes for cygnus x-1 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the same seed for the random number simulator was used in order enable a more direct comparison between the lightcurves . as is apparent",
    ", the mixed ou process can appear very different depending on which time scales are probed by the observation .",
    "equation ( [ eq - pmixou_asympt ] ) in the appendix demonstrates that the power spectrum of the continuous mixed ou process , with mixing function given by equation ( [ eq - mixfunc ] ) , exhibits the same behavior that is seen in the power spectrum of the x - ray lightcurves of gbhs and agn .",
    "this therefore suggests that the mixed ou process well represents the fluctuations in the x - ray lightcurves of gbh and agn , and may hold clues to the physical origin of the x - ray fluctuations .",
    "moreover , we have identified a process which gives an explicit connection between the break frequencies in the x - ray power spectra and characteristic time scales .",
    "this is important , because it is not always apparent how to connect a feature in the power spectrum with behavior in the time - domain .",
    "for example , we note that the characteristic time scales correspond to break frequencies when calculating the power spectrum in terms of @xmath59 , but simply taking the inverse of the ordinary frequency , @xmath18 , corresponding to the break will overestimate @xmath60 and @xmath61 by a factor of @xmath62 .",
    "physically , a mixed ou process may represent the x - ray fluctuations of gbh and agn under the propagating disturbance model , originally developed by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "stochastic disturbances originate in the region of the accretion disk outside of the x - ray emitting region .",
    "these disturbances propagate inwards and modulate the x - ray emitting region , which cause fluctuations in the x - ray flux . because many physically relevant time scales increase with radius ,",
    "the x - ray flux varies on a broad range of time scales due to the disturbances originating over a broad range in radii .",
    "if the disturbances at various radii are independent and are well described by an ou process with characteristic time scales that increase with radius , then the x - ray flux should be well described by a mixture of ou processes .",
    "the fact that we can construct a mixed ou process with psd similar to the x - ray power spectra of gbh and agn is consistent with this interpretation . in this case",
    ", the break frequencies correspond to the characteristic time scales of the disturbances at the maximum and minimum radii of the region that contributes to modulating the x - ray emission .",
    "we develop this interpretation further in   [ s - oudiff ] .",
    "similar to us , many authors have attempted to identify a particular stochastic process for the accretion rate perturbations . while we model the accretion rate perturbations as following an ou process ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have shown that a power spectrum with a @xmath18 region can also be created when the accretion rate perturbations have a lorentzian power spectrum , i.e. , when the disturbances are quasi - periodic .",
    "perturbations of this sort are expected if , for example , the perturbations are due to rayleigh - taylor instability @xcite .",
    "* see also @xcite and @xcite ) model the fluctuations as resulting from a magnetic field modeled as a first order autoregressive process , which is a discrete form of the ou process ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we can build on the work of @xcite and @xcite to show that a mixed ou process can model the viscous response of the accretion disk subject to a stochastic driving noise field , for the special case when the diffusion equation is linear .",

    "following @xcite and @xcite , define @xmath67 and a perturbation to the quantity @xmath68 as @xmath69 , and therefore @xmath70 .",
    "the nonlinear diffusion equation for a single perturbation can now be written as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath71 when @xmath65 is independent of @xmath64 , equation ( [ eq - nonlinear_perturb ] ) becomes a linear diffusion equation .",
    "equation ( [ eq - nonlinear_perturb ] ) only describes the evolution of a single perturbation , but in order to create flickering in @xmath72 we need to introduce a persistent source of the fluctuations .",
    "we can introduce fluctuations to @xmath72 , and therefore to @xmath73 , by introducing a stochastic source term to equation ( [ eq - nonlinear_perturb ] ) . for simplicity , we only study the linear form of equation ( [ eq - nonlinear_perturb ] ) , and therefore assume that the viscosity is independent of surface density .",
    "while it is unlikely that the viscosity is independent of @xmath64 , it is still illuminating to study the linear form of the diffusion equation in order to better understand how the disk responds to a stochastic driving noise , as it permits an analytical treatment .",
    "denote the stochastic source as @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is a spatially dependent white noise , and therefore @xmath76 is a wiener random field . by definition",

    "the wiener process is essentially a continuous time brownian motion , and therefore the wiener random field @xmath76 may be viewed as an infinite set of brownian motions indexed by the parameter @xmath79 . if there are no spatial correlations for @xmath76 , then @xmath81 and @xmath74 is called a ` space - time ' white noise ; however , in this case , solutions to the linear stochastic diffusion equation only exist for the case of one spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "we assume that the perturbations to the accretion rate only exist in a bounded accretion flow defined over a region @xmath82 , where @xmath83 represents the outer edge of the flow .",
    "we adopt the boundary condition given by @xcite and @xcite , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the first boundary condition assures that the perturbations of @xmath64 go to zero at the inner boundary of the disk , and the second ensures the the disk accretes the perturbations , i.e. , the perturbations can only leave through the inner boundary . including a stochastic source in the linear diffusion equation , our stochastic model for the accretion rate perturbations is defined by the following set of equations :",
    "@xmath86 equations ( [ eq - linear_perturb])([eq - bc ] ) can be solved using standard methods developed for stochastic partial differential equations , and a good introduction is @xcite .    before presenting the solution ,",
    "a couple of remarks are warranted .",
    "first , the model defined by equations ( [ eq - linear_perturb])([eq - bc ] ) is clearly only an approximation for several reasons . as mentioned before , the actual viscous response of the disk",
    "will be nonlinear , as the viscosity also likely depends on the surface density .",
    "in addition , for the noise process assumed above , there is nothing to prevent the linear model from producing negative values of @xmath64 and @xmath87 , which are unphysical .",
    "a better approach would be to postulate a stochastic model for the viscosity which ensures positivity of the solution , and then solve equation ( [ eq - nonlinear_perturb ] ) numerically using this perscription for @xmath88 .",
    "however , in this work our goal is to study the simpler model , for which analytical solutions are possible , in order to better understand how the disk responds to a random driving noise field , and thus provide some insight on how to connect features in the power spectra to the physics of the accretion disk .",
    "moreover , we will show that the solution to the linear diffusion equation is a mixture of ou - processes , providing justification for their use in modeling variability .",
    "second , it is important to note that the stochastic noise field in the partial differential equation , @xmath75 , is the time derivative of the process which is the source of the random perturbations , and is not the process itself . and third , the physical interpretation of the noise process is left unspecified , however , as many authors have suggested , @xmath89 may represent fluctuations in @xmath90 which are the result of turbulent and chaotic mhd effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , mhd turbulence has been observed in numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the solution to equations ( [ eq - linear_perturb])([eq - bc ] ) can be expressed through the eigenfunctions of the diffusion operator .",
    "the eigenfunctions , @xmath91 , and eigenvalues , @xmath92 , are defined by @xmath93 subject to the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are given in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , for the case where the viscosity @xmath94 is a power - law in @xmath79 .",
    "the eigenfunctions are orthonormal with respect to the weighting function @xmath95 , and form a complete set .",
    "the solution to equations ( [ eq - linear_perturb])([eq - bc ] ) is then given by @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 are a set of stochastic processes . in order to determine @xmath97 , we first note that if the spatial covariance function of the driving noise , @xmath80 , exists in the space spanned by the eigenfunctions , then we can express it as an eigenfunction expansion , @xmath98 where the coefficients are @xmath99 the random field @xmath76 can then be expressed as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , if @xmath94 has a power - law dependency on @xmath79 , then @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "in addition , if the driving noise field is a gaussian process , then the accretion rate perturbations will also be a gaussian process .    in general",
    ", we are interested in the stationary solution , which occurs when @xmath110 . as a practical matter",
    ", this occurs after a few viscous times have passed . in this case",
    ", the initial condition has been forgotten , and the solution to the linear stochastic diffusion equation is a mixture of ou processes , with the characteristic frequencies given by the eigenvalues of the linear diffusion operator , the mixing weights given by the product of the eigenfunctions of the linear diffusion operator and the coefficients of the eigenfunction expansion of the spatial covariance of the driving noise field .",
    "then , the covariance function of the accretion rate perturbations is @xmath111 and the power spectral density for fluctuations as a function of radius is @xmath112    the x - ray emission of accreting black holes is thought to be released in the inner regions of the disk , and therefore the behavior of the accretion rate fluctuations at small @xmath79 is of primary interest .",
    "it is illuminating to investigate asymptotic behavior of the power spectrum at @xmath113 for the case where @xmath114 .",
    "as per the discussion in   [ s - supou ] ,",
    "the power spectrum of a mixed ou process is flat on frequencies shorter than @xmath115 , and therefore the fluctuations are decorrelated on time scales longer than the viscous time scale at @xmath83 .",
    "however , on time scales short compared to the viscous time scale , the situation is more complicated as the power spectrum also depends on the spatial covariance structure of the driving noise field , @xmath80 , through the set of @xmath116 . for simplicity",
    ", we first assume that there is no spatial correlation in the driving noises , and therefore @xmath117 and @xmath118 for all @xmath119 .",
    "following @xcite , one can then show that the power spectrum of the accretion rate perturbations at small radii decays as a power - law on timescales short compared to the viscous time scale , with the slope of the power - law decay steepening when the viscosity increases less steeply toward larger raddi .",
    "therefore , if the viscosity increases more steeply toward higher radii , then at small radii the longer time scale perturbations are more suppressed relative to the short time scale perturbations .    in order to investigate the effect that the spatial correlations in the noise field have on the observed power spectra of @xmath120 , we study the case of @xmath121 . in this case",
    "the eigenfunctions are @xmath122 functions and the eigenvalues are @xmath123 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one can show that the power spectrum for @xmath124 at small radii is then @xmath125 as an example , suppose that the spatial correlations for @xmath76 decay exponentially in radius with some characteristic radius @xmath126 : @xmath127 then , in this case , the coefficients in the eigenfunction expansion , @xmath128 , are constant for @xmath129 and fall off as @xmath130 for @xmath131 .",
    "inserting this form for @xmath128 into the equation for the power spectrum of @xmath132 suppresses the higher frequency modes in the eigenfunction expansion , thus supressing the fluctuations on short time scales .",
    "in particular , for a power spectrum of the form equation ( [ eq - mdot_pspec2 ] ) , a second break will appear near @xmath133 , producing a second region which decays even faster than the intermediate region .",
    "the second characteristic time scale , @xmath134 , corresponds to the time it takes a perturbation traveling at the viscous speed , @xmath135 , to travel across a region corresponding to the spatial scale of the driving noise field : @xmath136 this may be the source of the high frequency break seen in x - ray power spectra of gbh and agn , although it may also be due to an abrupt change in the accretion geometry or viscosity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we note that if the amplitude of the driving noise field increases with radius , then @xmath116 will decrease with increasing @xmath119 , steepening the slopes in both the intermediate region ( @xmath137 ) and the high - frequency region @xmath138 .",
    "however , a decrease in viscosity with increasing radius also has this effect , and thus the two situations are degenerate .",
    "finally , we note that in order to connect the power - spectrum of luminosity fluctations with that of accretion rate fluctuations , heat and photon diffusion effects must also be considered .",
    "the diffusion of heat and photons are both governed by diffusion equations , and the radiative output of the disk may be described as resulting from the convolution of the solution to the heat and photon diffusion equations with the accretion rate fluctuations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are stochastic .",
    "the power spectrum of the radiative output is then the product of the power spectra for the accretion rate perturbations and the power spectra for the solution to the heat and photon diffusion equations . while a detailed treatment of the effects of heat and photon diffusion is beyond the scope of this work ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we note that based on the above discussion and the results of @xcite , the power spectra of the solution to the linear heat and photon diffusion equations will also be of the form of equation ( [ eq - pmixou_disc ] ) .",
    "therefore , additional breaks will occur at frequencies corresponding to the characteristic frequencies of the heat and photon diffusion equations , and the power spectra of the radiative output will steepen even further above these breaks .",
    "thus , the observed fluctuations in the emission from accreting black holes may be interpreted as the result of the response of the disk to a random noise field , where the viscous , thermal , and radiative response of the disk act as a series of low - pass filters on the driving noise field , sequentially suppressing the variability on time scales short compared to the characteristic time scales for viscous , thermal , and photon diffusion .",
    "furthermore , if the noise field is spatially correlated , then variability on time scales short compared to the drift time scale for the characteristic length of the spatial correlations is also suppressed .",
    "thus , breaks are expected to exist in the power spectra at the frequencies corresponding to these time scales , and the slope of the power spectra in the different regions contains information on the viscous , thermal , and radiative structure of the accretion flow , as well as the structure of the driving noise field .    for completeness , we summarize here the some of the results from the above discussion :    * the mixed ou process is the solution to the linear diffusion equation , subject to a random driving noise field .",
    "the mixing weights are the product of the eigenfunctions of the linear diffusion operator and the coefficients of the eigenfunction expansion of the covariance function of the driving noise field .",
    "the characteristic frequencies of the ou processes are the eigenvalues of the linear diffusion operator , subject to the appropriate boundary conditions . *",
    "the power spectrum of accretion rate perturbations at small radii , where most of the energy is thought to be released , is flat on time scales longer than the viscous time scale at the largest radii .",
    "on timescales shorter than @xmath108 , the power spectrum has the form @xmath139 , where @xmath140 and @xmath141 are constants .",
    "* there is a second break in the power spectrum of @xmath142 on time scales short compared to the crossing time of a perturbation traveling at the viscous speed across a region of length similar to the characteristic spatial correlation length of the driving noise field .",
    "the power spectrum of @xmath124 steepens on frequencies higher than this break . *",
    "if the viscosity of the disk increases toward higher radii , then in the inner region of the disk the long time scale fluctuations are surpressed compared to the short time scale fluctuations , thus flattening the power spectrum .",
    "similarly , if the amplitude of the driving noise increases toward smaller radii , the power spectrum also flattens .",
    "thus , these two effects are degenerate and can not be distinguished on the basis of power spectra alone .",
    "* heat and photon diffusion can introduce additional breaks in the power spectra of the emission from accreting black holes , with the power spectra steepening above these breaks .",
    "in the previous section we have suggested an interpretation of the mixed ou process developed in this work in terms of the viscous response of the accretion disk subject to a random driving noise field .",
    "however , the mixed ou process is not limited to linear diffusion models for viscous evolution of the accretion disk , and in fact one can go through the same steps outlined above to show that the mixed ou process is a solution for many parabolic stochastic partial differential equations , and thus will also describe , say , the diffusion of heat in the disk , which is governed by the heat equation .",
    "however , regardless of the physical mechanism , the mixed ou process provides an accurate statistical description of the lightcurves of gbh and agn , in the sense that it reproduces much of the shape of the power spectra of these objects . as a result , estimation of the break frequencies",
    "can be done directly from the observed lightcurve , and is therefore free of the biases due to windowing effects , which are inherent in fitting of power spectra .",
    "some features are not captured by this process , such as quasi - periodic oscillations and nonlinear effects .",
    "an additional quasi - periodic component can be modeled as a solution to a set of hyperbolic stochastic partial differential equations , in particular the random wave equation . however , inclusion of quasi - periodic oscillations to our model is beyond the scope of this work",
    ".      the mixed ou process may be fit using maximum - likelihood or bayesian techniques .",
    "this has the advantage that the parameters for the process are estimated directly from the observed lightcurve utilizing all of the information in the data .",
    "in particular , the estimates of the parameters for the power spectrum model are not biased by measurement errors , irregular sampling , or other windowing effects due to the finite time span of the lightcurve , such as red noise leak .",
    "while these biases may be corrected for using monte carlo methods @xcite , such methods are also computationally intensive and rely on a @xmath19 statistic .",
    "indeed , these benefits of time domain modeling are our primary motivation in developing the mixed ou process model ; we sought to obtain a means of estimating the break frequencies and variability amplitude of x - ray lightcurves in a manner that was free of the biases that can affect frequency domain techniques .    in order to calculate the likelihood function of the lightcurve ,",
    "it is necessary to assume a probability distribution for the driving noise process . in this work",
    "we assume that the driving noise @xmath32 is gaussian white noise ( i.e. , @xmath27 is the gaussian wiener process ) . in the context of the linear diffusion equation interpretation , this is equivalent to assuming that the driving noise field is a gaussian process .",
    "denote the @xmath143 observed flux values as @xmath144 , sampled at time values of @xmath145 .",
    "the observed flux values have independent gaussian measurement errors with variances @xmath146 .",
    "we denote @xmath147 to be the vectors containing the @xmath148 values of flux , time , and measurement error variance . in this case",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the likelihood function , as the lightcurves follow a @xmath148-dimensional multivariate normal distribution with mean @xmath23 and covariance matrix @xmath149 , where @xmath150 is given by equation ( [ eq - rmixou_disc ] ) calculated at the appropriate values , and @xmath151 operates on the vector @xmath152 by constructing a diagonal matrix with @xmath152 along the diagonal .",
    "unfortunately , direct calculation of the likelihood becomes computationally prohibitive for most reasonable values of @xmath148 .",

    "the sequence of @xmath192 should follow a zero mean gaussian white noise process with unit variance ; i.e. , there should be no systematic trends in @xmath193 with time and the distribution of the set of @xmath192 should be a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance equal to one . in practice , these assumptions are rarely true , although often the gaussian likelihood approximation is adequate for estimating features in the power spectrum , such as characteristic time scales and the logarithmic slope of the power spectrum , so long as there are not many large outliers .    the second method for assessing the quality of the fit which should be employed is to assess how well the mixed ou process fits the observed periodogram .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the monte carlo method of @xcite , and enables one to assess whether there are features on different time scales which the mixed ou process does not fit well , as such discrepancies may be difficult to analyze in the lightcurve residual plot .",
    "first , one should calculate the periodogram of the observed lightcurve .",
    "then , one can simulate a lightcurve having the same time sampling as the observed lightcurve for each of the mixed ou process parameters obtained from the mcmc sampler .",
    "alternatively , one could also just use the maximum - likelihood estimate , but simulating lightcurves for each of the mcmc random draws also incorporates our uncertainty in the model parameters .",
    "then , for each simulated lightcurve one calculates a periodogram .",
    "these periodograms can then be compared with the periodogram for the actual observed lightcurve to assess whether there are any time scales where the mixed ou stochastic process provides a poor fit .",
    "in order to illustrate our method , and to investigate its effectiveness , we applied it to three different data sets .",
    "the first is an x - ray lighturve of the galactic black hole cygnus x-1 in the low / hard state . for this object ,",
    "the data is of high enough quality to clearly see two breaks in the power spectrum .",
    "the second data set is the sample of local agn with long - term rxte data studied by @xcite , supplemented with xmm lightcurves when available .",
    "this sample of objects is well - studied , and broken power - law models have been estimated and reported by many authors . both of these data sets provide a good test for our statistical model , as it allows us to compare it with other well - established methods .",
    "the third data set consists of optical lightcurves of agn from the macho survey and the agn watch sample , taken from @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed these objects using only a single ou process , which is not as flexible as the mixed ou process .",
    "we exclude the lightcurves from the @xcite sample used by @xcite , as they are not as well sampled as the macho and agn watch sample .",
    "we used an archival rxte observation of cygnus x-1 from oct 23 , 1996 ( obs i d 10241 - 01 - 01 - 000 ) , which @xcite have analyzed and identify as a hard - state lightcurve .",
    "we extracted the binned pca lightcurve , using all channels , with the standard reduction routines .",
    "the lightcurve spanned @xmath194 ksec and was binned in 0.01 sec intervals .",
    "the psd for this observation is shown in figure [ f - cygx1 ] , where we have subtracted off the poisson noise level .",
    "we modeled the psd using a mixture of 32 ou processes , treating the weights as free parameters on a fixed logarithmic grid in the characteristic frequencies , @xmath195 ; the maximum and minimum values of @xmath195 correspond to an order of magnitude shorter and longer than the minimum and maximum time spacing observed in the lightcurve .",
    "unlike for agns , the lightcurve has @xmath196 data points , and computing the likelihood function is extremely computationally intensive .",
    "however , this large number of data points has the benefit that the psd is very well determined . as a result",
    ", we do not estimate the parameters for the mixed ou process from the likelihood function of the lightcurve , but instead use least squares to fit the model psd to the observed psd . the result is also shown in figure [ f - cygx1 ] .",
    "it should be noted that we do not bin the lightcurve as an integer number times the time - resolution of the instrument mode , and thus some aliasing is introduced to the periodogram .",
    "however , we do not consider this a concern as aliasing is likely to be negligible for the low - frequencies used in the fit .",
    "as can be seen , the mixed ou process is able to provide a good approximation to the psd for this observation of cygnus x-1 , although it is not a perfect fit .",
    "further improvement could be obtained by making the characteristic frequencies of the individual ou processes free parameters as well ; however , we do not do this is this would increase the number of free parameters to @xmath197@xmath198 , making the least - square optimization computationally difficult .",
    "we consider this approach of directly fitting the psd satisfactory for cygnux x-1 , even if it is not as powerful as maximum - likelihood , as our primary goal in developing our method is to estimate features in the psd , such as the break frequencies , from lightcurves that are of significantly poorer quality , for which high quality psds are not available . as such",
    ", we apply our model to cygnus x-1 merely to illustrate that it provides a good approximation of the psd .",
    "we applied our method to the x - ray lightcurves of 10 local agn , studied recently by @xcite .",
    "these objects have high quality lightcurves sampled over several decades in frequency , and have been extensively studied using fourier - based techniques , making them a good sample for testing our method .",
    "the sample is summarized in table [ t - xray_agn ] , which includes the values obtained previously in the literature from fourier - based techniques for the break frequency and logarithmic slope of the power spectra above the break frequency . the 2 - 10 kev rxte data is presented in @xcite , and is important for studying the longer time scale behavior . in order to also study variations on time scales @xmath199 day , we included xmm lightcurves from the archives , when available .",
    "the xmm 210 kev background subtracted lightcurves were extracted using the standard routines of the xmm scientific analysis system , and were binned every 48 sec .",
    "both the rxte and xmm lightcurves were fit simultaneously .",
    "the xmm 210 kev count rates were converted to 210 kev fluxes using the 210 kev flux values calculated by @xcite , with the exception of ngc 5506 , where we used the value calculated by @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the 210 kev luminosities based on the best fit spectral model to the 320 kev pca data .",
    "our best fit parameters , as well as the 90% confidence intervals , are also summarized in table [ t - xray_agn ] . in general , our values are consistent with values previously obtained by other authors using the fourier - based monte carlo method of @xcite , further validating our method .",
    "we obtain consistently smaller errors on the estimated parameters .",

    "we could not find anything unusual about these objects other than their timing properties .",
    "we also fit a flexible form of the mixed ou process to some of the better sampled optical lightcurves , treating the weights as free parameters on a fixed logarithmic grid for @xmath195 .",
    "we could not find any significant evidence that the optical psds diverged from either a single power - law or lorentzian psd .",
    "we have both optical and x - ray lightcurves for akn 564 , ngc 3783 , ngc 4051 , and ngc 5548 , and it is worth comparing the two estimated psds for each source . in figure [ f - optxray_psd ] we compare the estimated optical and x - ray psds for each source assuming the mixed ou model with power law weighting . for all sources we subtracted off the host galaxy flux , where we used the values reported by @xcite for ngc 3783 , ngc 4051 , and ngc 5548 , and the value reported by @xcite for ark 564 . in general ,",
    "the optical fluctuations are less variable then the x - ray fluctuations , except possibly on time scales @xmath234 days .",
    "furthermore , the optical psds fall off steeper toward high frequencies than the x - ray psds , and thus the short time scale optical fluctuations are more strongly suppressed relative to the x - ray fluctuations .",

    "one possible interpretation of these results is that the different psds represent how the different media in the two regions respond to a common driving process that is turbulent in both space and time , with the region emitting the optical photons more strongly suppressing the short - time scale noise fluctuations .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that @xmath24 is anti - correlated with @xmath13 for both the x - ray and optical lightcurves .",
    "for example , within the propagation class of models , this implies that while the source of the accretion rate perturbations may be the same , the optical emitting region more strongly suppresses the short time scale accretion rate perturbations , but when these perturbations reach the x - ray emitting region ( i.e. , the corona ) , which may also be subject to a driving noise field , the short time scale fluctuations are not as strongly filtered as this medium is not as ` stiff ' .",
    "however , if the optical psds continue to rise above the x - ray psds at longer time scales , as it appears they do , then the total amplitude of variability in the optical fluctuations surpasses that in the x - ray fluctuations .",
    "this is a departure from the behavior seen in soft state gbh , where the disk emission is significantly less variable than the corona , suggesting a descrepancy between the spectral - timing properties of gbhs and agn .",
    "in addition , larger optical variability amplitude than x - ray variability amplitude implies that either the source of the variations is different for the two emission regions , or that the power in the disturbances is somehow dissipated such that their variability amplitude has decreased by the time they reach the x - ray emitting region .",
    "however , the results also imply that all of the optical variability can not be due to reprocessing of x - ray emission , as has been shown in previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the only possible exception appears to be akn 564 , where the x - ray variability amplitude is larger at all time time scales .",
    "akn 564 is noteworthy as it is the only agn known to exhibit a second low - frequency break , and the additional x - ray variability may be due to an increase in the strength of the x - ray power - law component , such as is seen in gbh in the vhs .",
    "in this work we have developed a new model for the lightcurves of accreting black holes .",
    "the model is based on a mixture of ornstein - uhlenbeck stochastic processes and also happens to be the solution to the linear diffusion equation perturbed by a spatially correlated noise field .",
    "in essence , our model for quasar lightcurves may be thought of as a type of basis expansion , where the basis for the lightcurve is a set of independent stochastic processes .",
    "this allows flexible modeling of the psd so long as @xmath235 for all frequencies of interest , and we show that the mixed ou process provides a good approximation to the x - ray lightcurves of gbhs , and the optical and x - ray lightcurves of agn .",
    "our main results are    * the mixed ou process is the solution to the linear diffusion equation perturbed by a spatially correlated noise field , and thus the mixed ou process describes the evolution of viscous , thermal , or radiative perturbutions due to a driving noise , to the extant that the viscous , thermal , or radiative response of the accretion flow follows a linear diffusion equation . within this interpretation ,",
    "the low frequency break in the psd corresponds to the diffusion time scale in the outer region of the accretion flow , and the shape of the psd above the low frequency break depends on the viscosity of the flow ( or , more generally , the diffusion coefficient ) .",
    "if the noise field is spatially correlated , then an additional high frequency break in the psd may exist at the frequency corresponding to the time it takes a perturbation traveling at the viscous speed to cross the characteristic spatial scale of the noise field . *",
    "we derive the likelihood function of a lightcurve for the mixed ou process , given by equations ( [ eq - lik])([eq - deltai ] ) .",
    "this allows one to estimate the parameters of the mixed ou process for an observed lightcurve , and equivalently the psd , in a manner which is computationally efficient , unbiased by red noise leak and aliasing , and fully accounts for irregular sampling and measurement errors .",
    "if the parameters for a bending power - law are desired , then we also derive a form for the mixing weights which approximates a bending power - law , given by equation ( [ eq - plaw_weights ] ) . *",
    "we show that the mixture of lorentzians psds implied by the mixed ou process stochastic model is a good fit to the psd of an observation of cygnus x-1 in the hard state .",
    "* we applied our mixed ou process model to the x - ray lightcurves of 10 well - studied local agn and show that it provides a good description of their lightcurves , and we recover many of the psd features which have been obtained previously from direct fitting of the observed psds .",
    "we use the estimated break frequencies to recover the correlation between time scale of the high frequency break and black hole mass seen previously with this sample ; this includes new estimates of the high frequency time scales for fairall 9 and ngc 5548 , for which previously only upper limits were obtained . *",
    "we find a significant anti - correlation between black hole mass and the amplitude of the driving noise fluctuations , @xmath24 , which also parameterizes the amplitude of the high frequency psd .",
    "the form of this correlation is similar to what has been observed in optical lightcurves ( kbs09 ) , suggesting that the origin of the optical and x - ray variability for agn is at least partially shared .",
    "this correlation is even tighter than that between @xmath13 and the break frequency .",
    "mass estimates obtained using @xmath24 appear to have an uncertainty of @xmath0 dex , potentially making it the best single - observation mass estimator for agn .",
    "* we did not find significant evidence that most optical lightcurves of agn deviated significantly from a single ou process , i.e. , a lorentzian psd .",
    "however , we did find evidence that the optical lightcurves of 7 agn in a sample of 55 agn from the _ macho _ survey exhibited psds which were flatter than the @xmath2 shape seen in the majority of the sample , but the origin of this difference is unclear .",
    "these sources may exhibit flatter psds because we are seeing them on the @xmath236 part of the psd , i.e. , the break time scales are shorter and longer than the minimum and maximum time scales probed by the lightcurves .",
    "* we compare the optical and x - ray psds for akn 564 , ngc 3783 , ngc 4051 , and ngc 5548 and find that for the three ngc sources the short time scale fluctuations are more suppressed in the optical , but the long time scale fluctuations appear to be stronger in the optical .",
    "this implies that the total variability amplitude in the optical fluctuations is larger than that in the x - ray fluctuations , and thus the optical fluctuations can not be caused solely by reprocessing of x - ray emission .",
    "in addition , if both the optical and x - ray fluctations are caused by inwardly propagating fluctuations in , say , the accretion rate , then some of the power in the fluctuations must be dissipated by the time they reach the x - ray emitting region .",
    "akn 564 , the only agn believed to be in the very high accretion rate state , does not exhibit this behavior , and the optical fluctuations are always less variable then the x - ray fluctuations , at least over the range of time scales we probe .",
