    "0.6truecm there has been a remarkable progress in the studies of neutrino oscillations in the last several years . the experiments with solar , atmospheric and reactor neutrinos  @xcite",
    "have provided compelling evidences for the existence of neutrino oscillations driven by nonzero neutrino masses and neutrino mixing .",
    "evidences for oscillations of neutrinos were obtained also in the first long baseline accelerator neutrino experiment k2k  @xcite .",
    "it was predicted already in 1967  @xcite that the existence of solar neutrino oscillations would cause a deficit of solar neutrinos detected on earth .",
    "the hypothesis of solar neutrino oscillations , which in one variety or another were considered starting from the late 60 s as the most natural explanation of the observed  @xcite solar neutrino deficit ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , has received a convincing confirmation from the measurement of the solar neutrino flux through the neutral current reaction on deuterium by the sno experiment  @xcite , and by the first results of the kamland experiment  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the solar neutrino data obtained by homestake , sage , gallex / gno , super - kamiokande and sno experiments showed that the data favor the large mixing angle ( lma ) msw solution of the solar neutrino problem ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the first results of the kamland reactor experiment  @xcite have confirmed ( under the very plausible assumption of cpt - invariance ) the lma msw solution , establishing it essentially as a unique solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "the latest addition to this magnificent effort is the evidence presented recently by the super - kamiokande ( sk ) collaboration for an `` oscillation dip '' in the @xmath32dependence , of the ( essentially multi - gev ) @xmath2like atmospheric neutrino events dependence consists of @xmath2like events for which the relative uncertainty in the experimental determination of the @xmath33 ratio does not exceed 70% . ]",
    "@xcite , @xmath34 and @xmath35 being the distance traveled by neutrinos and the neutrino energy .",
    "as is well known , the sk atmospheric neutrino data is best described in terms of dominant 2-neutrino @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) vacuum oscillations with maximal mixing , @xmath38 .",
    "the observed dip is predicted due to the oscillatory dependence of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 oscillation probabilities , @xmath39 , on @xmath40 .",
    "the dip in the observed @xmath33 distribution corresponds to the first oscillation minimum of the @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) survival probability , @xmath43 , as @xmath33 increases starting from values for which @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath27 being the neutrino mass squared difference responsible for the atmospheric @xmath41 and @xmath42 oscillations .",
    "this beautiful result represents the first ever observation of a direct effect of the oscillatory dependence on @xmath33 of the probability of neutrino oscillations in vacuum .",
    "the interpretation of the solar and atmospheric neutrino , and of kamland data in terms of neutrino oscillations requires the existence of 3-neutrino mixing in the weak charged lepton current ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath46 here @xmath47 , @xmath48 , are the three left - handed flavor neutrino fields , @xmath49 is the left - handed field of the neutrino @xmath50 having a mass @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) neutrino mixing matrix  @xcite , @xmath53    where we have used a standard parametrization of @xmath52 with the usual notations , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the dirac cp - violation phase .",
    "if one identifies @xmath57 and @xmath58 with the neutrino mass squared differences which drive the solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , the data suggest that @xmath59 . in this case @xmath60 and @xmath13 , represent the neutrino mixing angles responsible for the solar and the dominant atmospheric neutrino oscillations , @xmath60 , @xmath13 , while @xmath12 is the angle limited by the data from the chooz and palo verde experiments @xcite .",
    "the 3-neutrino oscillations of the solar @xmath61 depend in the case of interest , @xmath59 , not only on @xmath62 and @xmath60 , but also on @xmath12 . a combined 3-neutrino oscillation analysis of the solar neutrino , chooz and kamland data showed  @xcite that for @xmath63 the allowed ranges of the solar neutrino oscillation parameters do not differ substantially from those derived in the 2-neutrino oscillation analyzes ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "a description of the indicated data in terms of @xmath64 and @xmath65 oscillations is possible ( at 99.73% c.l . ) for @xmath66 .",
    "the data favor the lma - i msw solution ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the lma - ii solution , corresponding to @xmath69 and approximately the same value of @xmath70 , is severely constrained by the fact  @xcite that the ratio of the rates of the cc and nc reactions on deuterium , measured with a relatively high precision in sno during the salt phase of the experiment  @xcite , turned out to be definitely smaller than 0.50 .",
    "this solution is currently allowed by the data only at 99.13% c.l .",
    "@xcite .    the preliminary results of the most recent improved analysis of the sk atmospheric neutrino data , performed by the sk collaboration , gave at 90% c.l .",

    "adding the k2k data  @xcite , the authors  @xcite find the same results for @xmath74 , the same @xmath75 best fit value and @xmath76 earlier combined analyzes of the sk atmospheric neutrino and the k2k data produced somewhat larger values of @xmath75 : the best fit value and the 90% c.l .",

    "we will use in our further discussion as illustrative the values @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "the two possibilities correspond to two different types of neutrino mass spectrum : with normal hierarchy ( nh ) , @xmath88 , and with inverted hierarchy ( ih ) , @xmath89 .",
    "the fact that the sign of @xmath86 is not determined when @xmath87 implies that when , e.g. , @xmath90 , two values of @xmath11 are possible , @xmath91 .",

    "it is difficult to overestimate the importance of getting more precise information about the value of the mixing angle @xmath12 , of determining the sign of @xmath27 , or the type of the neutrino mass spectrum ( with normal or inverted hierarchy ) , and of measuring the value of @xmath11 with a higher precision , for the future progress in the studies of neutrino mixing .",
    "although this has been widely recognized , let us repeat the arguments on which the statement is based .    the mixing angle @xmath12 , or the absolute value of the element @xmath96 of the pmns matrix , @xmath97 , plays a very important role in the phenomenology of the 3-neutrino oscillations .",
    "it drives the sub - dominant @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) and @xmath61 ( @xmath100 )  @xcite .",

    "it is a natural continuation of our similar study for water - erenkov detectors  @xcite . in the experiments with muon charge identification it will be possible to distinguish between",

    "the detector has relatively small mass , but after 5 years of data - taking it is expected to collect about 440 atmospheric @xmath41 and about 260 atmospheric @xmath42 multi - gev events ( having the interaction vertex inside the detector ) .",

    "it will accumulate sufficiently high statistics of atmospheric @xmath41 and @xmath42 induced events in several years , which would permit to search for effects of the subdominant @xmath101 ( @xmath103 ) and @xmath102 ( @xmath104 ) transitions .",

    ", @xmath42 , @xmath61 and @xmath100 , the earth matter effects can generate a difference between the @xmath101 ( @xmath103 ) and @xmath102 ( @xmath104 ) transitions . for @xmath115 , which is implied by the current solar and atmospheric neutrino data , and if @xmath116 , the earth matter effects can resonantly enhance either the @xmath101 and @xmath103 , or the @xmath102 and @xmath104 transitions , depending on the sign of @xmath27 .",

    "the expressions for the probabilities of @xmath101 ( @xmath103 ) and @xmath102 ( @xmath104 ) transitions contain also @xmath11 as a factor which determines their maximal values .",
    "since the fluxes of multi - gev @xmath41 and @xmath61 ( @xmath42 and @xmath100 ) differ considerably ( by a factor @xmath118 for @xmath119 gev ) , the earth matter effects can create a substantial difference between the @xmath120 and @xmath3 rates of events , produced by the atmospheric @xmath41 and @xmath42 in minos , ino , or any other detector of the same type .",
    "this difference can be relatively large and observable in the samples of the multi - gev @xmath112 events ( @xmath121 gev ) , in which the muons are produced by atmospheric neutrinos with relatively large path length in the earth , i.e. , by neutrinos crossing deeply the earth mantle  @xcite or the mantle and the core  @xcite .",
    "these are the neutrinos for which  @xcite @xmath122 , @xmath0 being the nadir angle characterizing the ( atmospheric ) neutrino trajectory in the earth .    for @xmath16 , the @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) and @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ) transitions in the earth lead to a reduction of the rate of the multi - gev @xmath113 events observable in minos , ino , etc .",

    "correspondingly , as observable which is sensitive to the earth matter effects , and thus to the value of @xmath10 and the sign of @xmath27 , as well as to @xmath11 , we can consider the nadir - angle distribution of the ratio @xmath123 of the multi - gev @xmath120 and @xmath3 event rates , or , equivalently , of the @xmath124 event rate asymmetry @xmath5/[n(\\mu^{- } ) + n(\\mu^+)]$ ] .",
    "the systematic uncertainty , in particular , in the nadir angle dependence of @xmath123 , and correspondingly in the asymmetry @xmath9 , can be smaller than those on the measured nadir angle distributions of the rates of @xmath120 and @xmath3 events , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "we have obtained predictions for the nadir - angle distribution of @xmath9 in the case of 3-neutrino oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath61 and @xmath100 , both for neutrino mass spectra with normal ( @xmath16 ) and inverted ( @xmath17 ) hierarchy , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and for @xmath129 .",
    "these are compared with the predicted nadir - angle distributions of the same asymmetry in the case of 2-neutrino @xmath36 and @xmath37 oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( i.e. , for @xmath130 ) , @xmath131 .",
    "predictions for the three types of asymmetries indicated above of the suitably integrated nadir angle distributions of the @xmath120 and @xmath3 multi - gev event rates are also given .",
    "our results show , in particular , that for @xmath18 and @xmath19 the effects of the earth matter enhanced subdominant transitions of the atmospheric neutrinos , @xmath101 and and @xmath103 , or @xmath102 and @xmath104 , can be sufficiently large to be observable with ino and possibly with minos detectors .",
    "conversely , if the indicated effects are observed in the minos and/or ino experiments , that would imply that @xmath132 , @xmath18 and at the same time would permit to determine the sign of @xmath27 and thus to answer the fundamental question about the type of hierarchy - normal or inverted , the neutrino mass spectrum has .",
    "let us note that the earth matter effects in atmospheric neutrino oscillations have been widely studied ( for recent detailed analyzes see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite , which contain also a rather complete list of references to earlier work on the subject ) .",
    "a rather detailed analysis for the monolith detector has been performed in ref .",
    ". a large number of studies have been done for the super - kamiokande detector , or more generally , for water - erenkov detectors . in ref .",
    "@xcite , in particular , the magnitude of the earth matter effects in the nadir angle distribution of the ratio of the multi - gev @xmath2like and @xmath133like events , measured in water - erenkov detectors , @xmath134 , has been investigated .",
    "this nadir angle distribution is the observable most sensitive to the matter effects of interest .",
    "it was concluded that for @xmath18 , @xmath135 and @xmath16 , the effects of the earth matter enhanced @xmath101 and @xmath103 transitions of the atmospheric @xmath41 and @xmath61 , might be observable with the super - kamiokande detector .",
    "however , determining the sign of @xmath27 would be quite challenging in this experiment ( or its bigger version - hyper - kamiokande  @xcite ) . in general , the matter effects in the nadir angle distribution of the ratio of the multi - gev @xmath2like and @xmath133like events , @xmath134 , which can be measured in the super - kamiokande or other water - erenkov detectors , are smaller than the matter effects in the nadir angle distribution of the ratio of the multi - gev @xmath120 and @xmath3 events , @xmath136 , which can be measured in minos , ino , or any other atmospheric neutrino experiment with sufficiently good muon charge identification .",
    "the reason is that in the case of water - erenkov detectors , approximately 2/3 of the rate of the multi - gev @xmath137 events is due to @xmath41 , and @xmath138 is due to @xmath42 ; similar partition is valid for the multi - gev @xmath133like events .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath27 , the matter effects enhance either the neutrino transitions , @xmath101 and and @xmath103 , or the antineutrino transitions , @xmath102 and @xmath104 , but not both types of transitions .",
    "correspondingly , because the @xmath139 and @xmath140 induced events are indistinguishable in water - erenkov detectors , only @xmath141 or @xmath138 of the events in the multi - gev @xmath2like and @xmath133like samples collected in these detectors are due to neutrinos whose transitions can be enhanced by matter effects .",
    "this effectively reduces the magnitude of the matter effects in the samples of multi - gev @xmath2like and @xmath133like events .",
    "obviously , such a `` dilution '' of the magnitude of the matter effects does not take place in the samples of the multi - gev @xmath120 and @xmath3 events , which can be collected in minos and ino experiments , i.e. , in the experiments with muon charge identification .",
    "0.6truecm in the present section we review the physics of the subdominant 3-neutrino oscillations of the multi - gev atmospheric neutrinos in the earth ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the subdominant @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) and @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) oscillations of the multi - gev atmospheric neutrinos of interest should exist and their effects could be observable if three - flavor - neutrino mixing takes place in vacuum , i.e. , if @xmath147 , and if @xmath148 is sufficiently large  @xcite .",
    "these transitions are driven by @xmath27 .",
    "the probabilities of the transitions contain @xmath11 as factor which determines their maximal value ( see further ) . for @xmath16 , the @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) and @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) transitions of the multi - gev atmospheric neutrinos ,",
    "are amplified ( suppressed ) by the earth matter effects ; if @xmath17 , the transitions of neutrinos are suppressed and those of antineutrinos are enhanced .",
    "therefore for a given sign of @xmath27 , the earth matter affects differently the transitions of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "thus , the study of the subdominant atmospheric neutrino oscillations can provide information , in particular , about the type of neutrino mass hierarchy ( or sign of @xmath27 ) , the magnitude of @xmath10 and the octant where @xmath13 lies .    under the condition @xmath59 , which the neutrino mass squared differences determined from the existing atmospheric and solar neutrino and kamland data satisfy ,",
