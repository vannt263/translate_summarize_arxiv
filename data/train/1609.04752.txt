    "<S> we provide a field - theoretic algorithm of obtaining energy momentum tensor ( emt ) for gravitationally coupled theories . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on an auxiliary field theory and equally applicable to both minimal and non - minimal coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm illuminates the connection between the emt , obtained by functional variation of the metric , and local balance of energy and momentum . </S>",
    "<S> our method is of cardinal value for the proper identification of the emt in context of non - minimally coupled gravity theories .    in the original formulation of general relativity ( gr ) , </S>",
    "<S> einstein introduced the physical energy momentum tensor ( emt ) of the matter theory as the source of curvature and curvature in turn determined the motion of the source @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , hilbert enunciated an action principle to obtain einstein s equations in the usual way , i.e. by extremizing an action . </S>",
    "<S> various prescriptions for obtaining emt were developed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most popular algorithm @xcite is to vary the action with respect to the background metric , leading to the definition @xmath0 where , @xmath1 is the generic action of the source fields minimally coupled to external gravity the emt thus obtained is symmetric and covariently conserved . </S>",
    "<S> physics of interactions other than gravity are described by field theories in the flat ( minkowskian ) tangent space . in this context </S>",
    "<S> it may be noted that noether proved @xcite that corresponding to a symmetry of the field theoretic action there exists a conserved current . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , translational symmetry leads to a conserved emt @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach has , however , been proved to be difficult in curved space - time and therefore , in the theories of gravitation the noether s algorithm retired in the background . </S>",
    "<S> however , one should remember that the emt obtained from equation ( [ def ] ) has no obvious connection with the physical definition of emt that involves flow of energy and momentum @xcite . in the emt obtained by noether s method </S>",
    "<S> this connection is strong because here the conservation of emt is connected with the translational symmetry of the system and the energy momentum four - vector is a generator of the translation . </S>",
    "<S> actually our faith on the definition ( [ def ] ) relies on examples where the two methods give the same result . </S>",
    "<S> but all the examples where this equivalence is demonstrated are minimally coupled theories . for non - minimally coupled theories </S>",
    "<S> the definition ( [ def ] ) can not be applied as such since @xmath1 can not be seperately identified . </S>",
    "<S> the usual way around is to write the equation of motion corresponding to the metric @xmath2 and read - off the emt by rearranging different terms therein . </S>",
    "<S> naturally there is ambiguity as the rearrangement follows no definitive prescription @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this ambiguity may only be resolved if a dynamical approach is available to identify the source producing curvature . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present a field - theory based algorithm ( applicable to both minimally and non - minimally coupled theories ) to this end .    </S>",
    "<S> the essence of our approach consists of the following . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the spirit inherent in ( [ def ] ) which is the response of the source due to variation of the background metric where the metric is external and not dynamical . as is well - known the primitive definition of emt is based on the balance of energy and momentum which is a local phenomena . hence , to construct an emt from the physical perspective the locally inertial coordinates are particularly suitable . in these coordinates , </S>",
    "<S> the metric assumes value as in the flat ( minkowski ) space time and its first derivtives vanish . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless the curvature of the background spacetime shows up in the nonvanishing second derivatives of the metric . </S>",
    "<S> the first step of our method is to write the matter field theory coupled with external gravity in a locally inartial coordinate system constructed at a point p in the curved riemann manifold . </S>",
    "<S> a crucial step is then to view the resulting action as a field theory in the flat tangent space at that point p with the reasonable assumption that the emt obtained from this field theory will agree with the original theory on the overlap ( see figure 1 ) . for this field theory </S>",
    "<S> translational symmetry will hold , allowing us to apply noether theorem . </S>",
    "<S> we then have a conserved emt for the field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the next step is to revert to the patch around p , where , the emt just obtained coincides with that of the gravitationally coupled theory , in the locally inertial coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we will lift it to the general coordinates , according to the principle of general covariance . </S>",
    "<S> this completes the construction of a symmetric and conserved emt which serves as the source for the original theory in curved space - time .    from the above description of the proposed method it is apparent that the procedure is applicable ( at least in principle ) for a generic theory coupled to gravity . for definiteness and relevance </S>",
    "<S> we take a non - minimally coupled quintessence model to illustrate our method .        </S>",
    "<S> we start with the following action : @xmath3 \\label{qa}\\ ] ] note that a non - zero @xmath4 signifies nonminimal coupling . in ( [ qa ] ) , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 is given by @xmath6^{-1}$ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> as the first step of our procedure we abstract from ( [ qa ] ) the form of the theory coupled with curved space - time when the metric is external . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the lagrangian @xmath7 \\label{l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that metric in ( [ l ] ) is a background field and influences the motion through the coupling with the scalar field through curvature .    </S>",
    "<S> so far , the coordinate system was general , charting the curved spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the next step of our method is to concentrate at the neighbourhood of the point p ( see fig.1 ) and adopt the locally inertial coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> these coordinates are specified by the following conditions    1 .   the value of the metric @xmath8 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the value of the first derivative of the metric , @xmath9    the curvature is , however , nonzero as the second derivative of the metric are nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> the riemann tensor is expressed in the form @xcite , @xmath10 the ricci tensor is @xmath11 the ricci scalar is obtained on another contraction as , @xmath12    the lagrangian ( [ l ] ) can now be written in terms of the locally inertial coordinates , using ( [ 2 ] ) as @xmath13 note that due to the condition ( [ g ] ) , @xmath14 .    the region in which the locally inertial coordinates are defined is a small patch containing the point @xmath15 where the tangent space at @xmath15 coincides with the curved background . in this </S>",
    "<S> flat ( minkowski ) tangent space , we can choose a coordinate system that becomes identical with the locally inertial frame in the region of overlap . </S>",
    "<S> the crux of the method is to view the lagrangian ( [ flat_l ] ) as a new field theory in this flat ( minkowski ) spacetime with metric @xmath16 , where two different kinds of fields are involved . </S>",
    "<S> one is the scalar field @xmath17 and the the other is @xmath18 , a second rank tensor field . while writing ( [ l ] ) as a field theory ( [ flat_l ] ) in the tangent space all these fields together close the system . </S>",
    "<S> we are now in a position to apply noether theorem to get the conserved emt of ( [ flat_l ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> another point to note is that in studying the dynamics dictated by ( [ flat_l ] ) , we will not use the restrictions , ( [ delg ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the conservation of emt involves a differentiation , so dropping a first derivative of @xmath2 at the level of emt will be equivalent to dropping a second derivative in the conservation equation , which is a nontrivial omission . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions have played their role in providing us the appropriate field thery for the starting point of the algorithm .    </S>",
    "<S> a characteristic feature in the lagrangian ( [ flat_l ] ) is the presence of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is a higher derivative field theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion for the @xmath17 field is obtained as usual , @xmath20 in the above , @xmath21 denotes differentiation of @xmath22 with respect to @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the equation of motion for the @xmath2 field is @xcite , @xmath23-{{\\partial}_\\mu}\\left[\\frac{{\\partial}\\mathcal{l}}{{\\partial}({{\\partial}_\\mu}{{g_{\\alpha\\beta}})}}\\right]+\\frac{{\\partial}\\mathcal{l}}{{\\partial}{g_{\\alpha\\beta}}}=0 \\label{eqmg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the expression ( [ flat_l ] ) , we get the explicit form , @xmath24\\{\\eta^{\\alpha\\nu}{\\eta^{\\mu\\beta}}-\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}{\\eta^{\\alpha\\beta}}\\}=0 \\label{eqng}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apprently this equation makes no reference to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath4 is a completely arbitrary function which couples @xmath2 with @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> so , eliminating @xmath25 from equation([eqng ] ) and ( [ eqmphi ] ) , the explicit equation of motion for the fields @xmath2 can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> also one can alternatively write equation ( [ eqng ] ) as , @xmath26 operating by @xmath27 on both sides we find that the left hand side vanishes . clearly , @xmath25 can not be solved . ] from equation([eqng ] ) or ( [ f ] ) which is a manifestation of its arbitrariness .    the construction of the emt will now be detailed . following noether s prescription , the expression for the same is @xmath28 which gives @xmath29 \\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\left[\\frac{{m_{\\rm pl}}^2}{2}\\left(\\eta^{\\lambda\\mu}\\eta^{\\sigma\\beta}-\\eta^{\\sigma\\mu}\\eta^{\\lambda\\beta } \\right ) \\partial^{\\nu}\\partial_{\\sigma } g_{\\lambda\\beta}\\right]f(\\phi)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\quad\\partial_\\sigma\\left[\\frac{{m_{\\rm pl}}^2}{2}\\left(\\eta^{\\lambda\\mu}\\eta^{\\sigma\\beta}-\\eta^{\\sigma\\mu}\\eta^{\\lambda\\beta } \\right)f(\\phi)\\right]{\\partial^\\nu}{g_{\\lambda\\beta } } \\label{t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] an explicit check of the conservation of @xmath30 is due . </S>",
    "<S> a straight forward calculation shows , @xmath31 in arriving at the above conservation law we have used the equations of motion ( [ eqmphi ] ) and ( [ eqng ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the last term , which contains the factor @xmath32 takes a very important role in the conservation of the constructed emt . </S>",
    "<S> however when lifting to the curved spacetime this term will vanish , since on the curved spacetime metric compatibility will apply . </S>",
    "<S> thus the conservation will get disturbed . </S>",
    "<S> such situations can be avoided if we rewrite the expression ( [ t ] ) for @xmath30 as @xmath33\\nonumber\\\\ & & - \\frac{{m_{\\rm pl}}^2}{2}\\left(\\eta^{\\lambda\\mu}\\eta^{\\sigma\\beta } -\\eta^{\\sigma \\mu}\\eta^{\\lambda\\beta } \\right ) \\left(\\partial^{\\nu}\\partial_{\\sigma } g_{\\lambda\\beta}\\right ) f(\\phi)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{{m_{\\rm pl}}^2}{2}\\left(\\eta^{\\lambda\\mu}\\eta^{\\sigma\\beta } - \\eta^{\\sigma\\mu}\\eta^{\\lambda\\beta}\\right)\\partial^{\\nu}\\left\\ { g_{\\lambda\\beta}\\partial_{\\sigma } f(\\phi)\\right\\ } </S>",
    "<S> - \\frac{{m_{\\rm pl}}^2}{2}\\left[\\eta^{\\lambda \\mu } \\left(\\partial^{\\beta } \\partial^{\\nu}f \\right ) g_{\\lambda \\beta }   - \\eta^{\\lambda \\beta}\\left(\\partial^{\\mu } \\partial^{\\nu}f </S>",
    "<S> \\right ) g_{\\lambda \\beta}\\right ] \\label{t11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is in a form that avoides the explicit occurence of first derivatives of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this completes the construction of the emt of our field theory ( [ flat_l ] ) by noether method . </S>",
    "<S> however , before we can import the emt ( [ t11 ] ) to the local patch at p and express it in terms of general coordinates , we have to ensure that all the terms have unambiguous correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> to give an example , for the first and second term of ( [ t11 ] ) this can readily be done , but not for the third term , owing to the presence of the factor @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> one should realize that @xmath35 at this level is not the metric , but a second rank tensor field and @xmath36g_{\\lambda\\beta } \\ne 0.$ ] we have to improve the emt ( [ t11 ] ) so as to get rid of such ambiguity .    a possible way is to add a term @xmath37 to the emt ( [ t11 ] ) , where @xmath38 is a third rank tensor antisymmetric in its first two indices such that @xmath39 vanishes identically . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures the conservation of the improved emt @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an appropriate choice is @xmath40 \\label{m}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath38 has the required antisymmetric in @xmath41 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> adding @xmath43 with @xmath30 in ( [ t11 ] ) , we get the improved tensor , @xmath44 - { m_{\\rm pl}}^2 r^{\\mu\\nu } f(\\phi )   \\nonumber\\\\ & + &   \\frac{m_{\\rm pl}{}^2}{2 }   \\eta^{\\nu \\rho } \\left(\\eta^{\\lambda\\mu}\\eta^{\\sigma\\beta } - \\eta^{\\sigma\\mu}\\eta^{\\lambda\\beta } \\right ) \\partial_{\\rho}\\left\\{g_{\\lambda\\beta}\\partial_\\sigma f(\\phi)\\right\\ } - \\frac{{m_{\\rm pl}}^2}{2}\\left[\\eta^{\\lambda \\mu } \\left(\\partial^{\\beta } \\partial^{\\nu}f \\right ) g_{\\lambda \\beta }   - \\eta^{\\lambda \\beta}\\left(\\partial^{\\mu } \\partial^{\\nu}f \\right ) g_{\\lambda \\beta}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + &   \\frac{{m_{\\rm pl}}^2}{2 } \\eta^{\\nu\\beta}\\left(\\eta^{\\lambda\\mu}\\eta^{\\rho\\sigma } - \\eta^{\\rho\\mu}\\eta^{\\lambda\\sigma } \\right ) \\left [ \\partial_{\\rho}\\left\\{g_{\\lambda\\beta}\\partial_{\\sigma } f(\\phi)\\right\\ } - 3 \\partial_{\\sigma}\\left\\{g_{\\lambda \\beta}\\partial_{\\rho } f(\\phi)\\right\\}\\right ] \\label{t111}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have used the relation @xmath45 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad- \\eta^{\\nu\\beta}\\left ( \\eta^{\\mu\\lambda}\\eta^{\\rho \\sigma } - \\eta^{\\mu\\rho}\\eta^{\\lambda \\sigma}\\right)\\partial_\\rho ( g_{\\lambda\\beta } \\partial_\\sigma f ) \\label{manipulation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obtained using equation ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ eqng ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the final step of our algorithm is to import the emt ( [ t111 ] ) to the local patch at the point p and lift it to the general coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> first note that in the overlap region of the tangent space and the curved space , equation ( [ t111 ] ) is the appropriate emt for the scalar field nonminimally coupled with gravity , given by ( [ qa ] ) , in terms of locally inertial coordinates . the different terms on the right hand side of ( [ t111 ] ) are in appropriate tensorial form suitable to be lifted to general coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath46 one can now readily obtain the expression for the emt in general coordinates . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath2 again assumes the role of metric , metric compatibility applies .    as can be checked directly , our algorithm , based on noether theorem and dynamics of fields , leades to an emt which is symmetric and covariantly conserved . </S>",
    "<S> based as it is on the local conservation of energy - momentum , this emt serves as the source of gravity _ a la _ einstein . hence following the original spirit of general relativity , we write the equation of motion of non - minimally coupled quintessence model as @xmath50 the correspondence with the hilbert action principle must be investigated . for the minimal coupling @xmath51 and </S>",
    "<S> the equivalence is obvious . </S>",
    "<S> much more interesting and really nontrivial is the case when @xmath52 , i.e. , non - minimally coupled theories . </S>",

    "<S> the non - conservation has been criticised @xcite . alternatively , </S>",
