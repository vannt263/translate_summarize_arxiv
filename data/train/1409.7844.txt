    "with the increase in renewable generation such as wind and solar power as well as the intrusion of smart loads such as plug - in hybrid vehicles and smart buildings , the operational characteristics of power systems are gradually becoming more complex @xcite .",
    "since the dynamic models of these renewable sources and loads are inherently nonlinear , and very often stochastic , it is extremely important for system operators to employ algorithms by which all possible feasible equilibria of an overall complex power system model can be computed , and their stability properties can be evaluated so that power dispatches and control decisions can be planned accordingly .",
    "the resulting operating point as a solution of a highly nonlinear system of equations is known as the load flow problem @xcite .",
    "computing equilibria by solving load flow equations for a conventional power system model has been a standard practice in the power industry for decades , with several advanced numerical algorithms being proposed in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , there is still a lack of insight on how these equilibria characteristics may change as operators move towards more renewable penetration , especially the penetration of wind power which is scheduled to reach a @xmath0 penetration by 2030 @xcite .",
    "conventional load flow algorithms that generally estimate local solutions of nonlinear equations may not be sufficient to compute all possible feasible solutions in such cases , and more advanced algorithms are needed .    in this paper , we address this problem and employ a homotopy based numerical continuation method to solve for power system equilibria with increasing levels of wind penetration .",
    "we first derive the end - to - end dynamic model of the wind - integrated system considering synchronous generators , loads and a wind plant consisting of a doubly - fed induction generator coupled to a wind turbine .",
    "the models of each of these subcomponents are coupled to each other via power flow , thereby leading to a differential - algebraic ( dae ) model for the overall system .",
    "on applying the homotopy - based algorithm we find that even for fixed levels of power consumption and generation multiple solutions of the load flow equations can coexist , especially due to the strong influence of the voltage control setpoints in the dfigs on the active and reactive power flows in the grid .",
    "this is , of course , in sharp contrast to the conventional load flow results where generally only one feasible or normal solution exists , characterized by high voltage level and correspondingly low currents @xcite .",
    "the method , therefore , brings out the explicit possibilities where increasing the level of wind penetration , and that too at specific buses in a system , may lead to very different , new stable solutions for load flow .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a _",
    "parameter homotopy _ algorithm which can be viewed as an extension of the recently developed numerical polynomial homotopy continuation ( nphc ) method @xcite .",
    "the homotopy - based algorithm starts by observing that the power flow equations of the wind - integrated model are given by multivariate nonlinear polynomials by expanding the voltage phasor at any bus to its real and imaginary parts . solving nonlinear algebraic equations , in general ,",
    "is a highly nontrivial task .",
    "using recently developed methods in computational algebraic geometry , however , deriving all solutions of a system of polynomial equations is now possible .",
    "one approach that is known to have only isolated solutions is to compute a grobner basis ( gb ) that converts the original system of equations to a triangular form , similar to the row - echelon form for linear equations .",
    "the new system is referred to as a gb , and the algorithm to compute it as the buchberger algorithm @xcite . since complex solutions also include real solutions , by this approach one can find all real solutions .",
    "so far the approach has been rather underutilized for load flow calculations in power systems except for a few attempts that are mostly based on small toy models @xcite . the proposed method in this work",
    "can solve a set of nonlinear algebraic equations over a number of parameter values with greater computational efficiency as compared to the existing methods . instead of solving the equations for each parameter value , the proposed method can solve the equations at generic complex values of the parameter .",
    "the solutions of the generic system can be used to obtain the solutions for the physical values of the parameter which drastically reduces the computational effort and time . applying this method to a 7-bus 5-machine wind power system model",
    "we show that with increasing wind penetration the system may exhibit undesired or poorly damped poles , and in some instances even unstable poles .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we provide the dynamic model equations for synchronous generators , wind turbines and dfig , and derive the coupled dae model via power flow . in section iii",
    "we formulate the problem of equilibrium analysis .",
    "section iv introduces the homotopy based approach to solve the nonlinear load flow model .",
    "section v presents a case study on a representative power system model with considerable wind injection followed by the conclusions .",
    "we consider a power system with @xmath1 buses and @xmath2 generators .",
    "these generators consist of a set @xmath3 of synchronous generators and one wind power plant . without loss of generality we can reorder the buses and classify them into 3 sets namely the set of synchronous generator bus @xmath4 , the wind injection bus @xmath5 and the load buses @xmath6 . to obtain the equilibrium for this system , our first task is to derive its dynamic model considering both nonlinear swing dynamics and wind power dynamics .",
    "this is presented as follows .",
    "we model each generator @xmath7 using the swing equations ,    [ eqn : sync_gen ] @xmath8    here @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the phase angle , rotor speed , inertia , the mechanical power input and the active power output of synchronous generator @xmath7 .",

    "this turbine serves as an aggregate model of a group of turbines injecting power to the grid at a point of common coupling , as shown in figure [ fig : wind_gen ] .",
    "this common bus is indexed as @xmath23 .",
    "we adjust the power output level of the resulting ` wind injection ' through a parameter @xmath24 which represent the number of wind turbines connected to the bus @xmath23 .",

    "@xmath66 , therefore , serves as the coupling variable for the dfig states to the rest of the system .",

    "one way to achieve that will be to solve the equations for every feasible combinations of the parameter values , which is highly inefficient and computationally expensive .",
    "one can in principle resort to the so - called comprehensive gb technique in which one can leave the parameters in the symbolic form . this idea was used in @xcite with an attempt to use the cgb technique to solve parametric power flow for conventional grid models .",
    "more recently , a numerical method called the numerical polynomial homotopy continuation ( nphc ) method @xcite has successfully been applied to solve up to @xmath124 bus power flow systems in @xcite .",
