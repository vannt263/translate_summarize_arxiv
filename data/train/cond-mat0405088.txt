    "[ intro ] magnetic fields can tune the electronic state of strongly - correlated electron systems .",
    "it is well - known that magnetic fields strongly affect the superconducting properties as well as the normal - state ones . for conventional superconductors , the superconducting transition curve in magnetic fields shifts to the low - temperature side in parallel with increasing field , which is attributed to the small superconducting fluctuation originating from the large superconducting coherence length .",
    "( this is called a parallel shift . ) for the high-@xmath11 cuprates , on the other hand , the superconducting transition curve shows a so - called fan - shape broadening in the underdoped regime ,  @xcite which is attributed to the large superconducting fluctuation originating from the small superconducting coherence length and the quasi - two - dimensional superconductivity .    as for magnetic - field effects on the normal - state properties ,",
    "some interesting behaviors of the normal - state electrical resistivity at low temperatures below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath11 have been found through the destruction of the superconductivity by the application of magnetic field . in the underdoped la@xmath1sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lsco ) , for example ,",
    "the in - plane resistivity , @xmath0 , in the normal state exhibits an insulating behavior at low temperatures , diverging in proportion to ln(1/@xmath10 ) , though the origin of the ln(1/@xmath10 ) dependence has not been clarified .",
    "@xcite the ln(1/@xmath10 ) dependence has also been observed in the underdoped bi@xmath12sr@xmath1la@xmath2cuo@xmath13 ( bslco ) below @xmath14 ( the hole concentration per cu ) @xmath15 ,  @xcite suggesting that the ln(1/@xmath10 ) dependence may be a common feature of @xmath0 in the normal state of the underdoped high-@xmath11 cuprates at low temperatures .",
    "recently , magnetic - field effects on the charge - spin stripe order  @xcite have also attracted great interest .",
    "elastic neutron scattering measurements in magnetic fields for lsco with @xmath9 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) under the orthorhombic mid - temperature ( omt ) structure ( space group : _ bmab _ ) have revealed that the intensity of the incommensurate magnetic peaks around ( @xmath16 , @xmath16 ) in the reciprocal lattice space increases with increasing field parallel to the c - axis , suggesting the stabilization of the magnetic order .",
    "for lsco with @xmath7 , on the other hand , the enhancement of the incommensurate magnetic peaks is observable but small .",
    "@xcite the magnetic order is considered to be almost stabilized even in zero field for @xmath17 ,  @xcite so that the development of the magnetic order by the application of magnetic field is slight .",
    "the enhancement of the incommensurate magnetic peaks has also been observed for the excess - oxygen doped la@xmath12cuo@xmath18 ( lco ) with the stage-4 and state-6 structures .",
    "@xcite for la@xmath5nd@xmath6sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lnsco ) with @xmath19 where the charge - spin stripe order is stabilized under the tetragonal low - temperature ( tlt ) structure ( space group : _ p_4@xmath12/_ncm _ ) , on the contrary , field effects on neither the charge nor magnetic peaks associated with the charge - spin stripe order have been observed up to 7 t.  @xcite these results suggest that a sort of spin stripe order in the omt phase of lsco and in lco is stabilized by the application of magnetic field , while the charge - spin stripe order in the tlt phase of lnsco is almost never affected .",

    "[ p - d ] , it is noted that both lnsco with @xmath7 and lbco with @xmath8 are located in the regime where the superconductivity is suppressed in the neighborhood of @xmath21 , while lbco with @xmath4 is located outside this regime .",
    "lbco with @xmath9 is just at the boundary between the inside and outside of this regime . in the elastic neutron scattering measurements of lbco  @xcite and lnsco  @xcite , the incommensurate elastic charge and magnetic peaks associated with the stripe order",
    "have been observed for @xmath9 and 0.12 below the structural phase transition temperature between the omt and tlt/_pccn _ phases , @xmath20 , in zero field , but not for @xmath4 .",
    "these mean that the static charge - spin stripe order is formed at low temperatures below @xmath20 for @xmath9 , 0.11 and 0.12 even in zero field .",
    "moreover , it has been found that the intensity of the elastic charge peaks is weaker in @xmath9 than in @xmath17 of lbco ,  @xcite suggestive of a less - stabilized static charge order in @xmath9 . for @xmath4 ,",
    "on the other hand , the stripe order is not stabilized even at low temperatures .",
    "single crystals of lbco with @xmath4 , 0.10 , 0.11 and lnsco with @xmath7 were grown by the traveling - solvent floating - zone method under flowing o@xmath12 gas of 4 bar .",

    "figure [ r - t ] displays the temperature dependence of @xmath0 in various magnetic fields for lbco with @xmath4 , 0.10 , 0.11 and lnsco with @xmath7 . for @xmath9 , 0.11 and 0.12 , a jump in @xmath0 is observed at @xmath22 k , @xmath23 k and @xmath24 k with decreasing temperature , respectively . for @xmath4 , no jump is observed , suggesting that no structural transition to the tlt phase occurs and that the omt phase remains at least down to the lowest measured temperature of 1.5 k.  @xcite     in the @xmath25 vs @xmath10 plane for la@xmath1ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 with @xmath4 , 0.10 and 0.11 . ]",
    "focusing the attention on the superconducting transition curve , the broadening is observed with increasing field for @xmath4 , as usually observed in the underdoped high-@xmath11 cuprates . for @xmath8 , on the other hand , it is found that the superconducting transition curve shifts to the low - temperature side in parallel with increasing field .",
    "@xcite to be more visible , contour maps of @xmath0 in the @xmath25 vs @xmath10 plane are shown in fig . [ contour ] for lbco with @xmath4 , 0.10 and 0.11 . in each @xmath26",
    ", the region where the color starts to change from that at high temperatures of @xmath27 60 k with decreasing temperature roughly corresponds to the onset region of the superconducting transition . for @xmath4",
    ", it is found that the relatively sharp transition of @xmath0 around @xmath11 in zero field is broadened with increasing field . for @xmath8 , on the contrary , the transition of @xmath0 around @xmath11 remains sharp even in magnetic fields .",
    "the parallel shift of @xmath0 is also observed for @xmath7 in lnsco as shown in fig .",
    "[ r - t ] .",
    "these suggest an intimate relation between the parallel shift and the suppression of superconductivity around @xmath28 or the formation of the charge - spin stripe order .",
    "a remarkable feature is for @xmath9 that the superconducting transition curve shows the broadening in low fields , while it changes to the parallel shift in high fields above 9 t. in fig .",
    "[ contour ] , it is found that the broad transition of @xmath0 around @xmath11 below 9 t changes to the sharp one above 9 t for @xmath9 .",
    "this dramatic change indicates that the application of magnetic field causes a crossover from the usual state of the underdoped high-@xmath11 cuprates to the peculiar state around @xmath28 .",
    "another remarkable feature observed for @xmath9 is that the normal - state - like behavior of @xmath0 , characterized by the almost linear @xmath10-dependence , is observed between @xmath20 and the onset temperature of superconductivity , @xmath29 , of @xmath30 k at 9 t and that @xmath0 between @xmath20 and @xmath29 increases with increasing field above 9 t and finally exhibits an insulating behavior for @xmath31 t. for @xmath8 and 0.12 , on the other hand , the increase of @xmath0 between @xmath20 and @xmath29 with increasing field is negligibly small up to 15 t , compared with that for @xmath9 . to be summarized ,",
    "lbco with @xmath4 is a typical underdoped sample characterized by the broadening of the superconducting transition curve in magnetic fields .",
    "both lbco with @xmath8 and lnsco with @xmath7 are peculiar samples around @xmath28 characterized by the parallel shift of the superconducting transition curve in magnetic fields .",
    "lbco with @xmath9 is a rather unique sample that shows the broadening in low fields and the parallel shift in high fields above 9 t and whose @xmath0 in the normal state below @xmath20 markedly increases with increasing field up to 15 t.",
    "first , we discuss the intimate relation between the superconducting transition curve and the stripe order .",
    "it is well - known that the broadening of the superconducting transition curve observed for @xmath4 is characteristic of the underdoped high-@xmath11 cuprates with large superconducting fluctuation .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , the parallel shift of the superconducting transition curve is observed for @xmath8 and 0.12 and for @xmath9 above 9 t. the parallel shift has also been observed in lnsco with @xmath19 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and lsco with @xmath7 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) where the static stripe order of charges and/or spins is formed at low temperatures . these suggest that both the superconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation and the static stripe order are realized in one sample . here",
    ", it is an important issue whether the superconducting region and the static stripe - ordered one coexist microscopically or are separated macroscopically . from the neutron scattering measurements in la@xmath32ba@xmath33sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , the static stripe order has been suggested to compete with the superconductivity .",
    "@xcite moreover , from the muon - spin - relaxation measurements in la@xmath1sr@xmath2cu@xmath34zn@xmath35o@xmath3 around @xmath36 , it has been suggested that the superconductivity is destroyed in a region where frequencies of the dynamical stripe fluctuations are lower than @xmath37 hz .",
    "@xcite therefore , the superconducting region and the static stripe - ordered one are probably separated macroscopically .",
    "the reason why the superconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation is realized in a sample with the static stripe - ordered region is still an open question .",
    "a possible origin is that the out - of - plane superconducting coherence length , @xmath38 , might be relatively large under the influence of the correlation of the static stripe order along the c - axis ,  @xcite leading to the three - dimensional superconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation .",
    "next , we discuss the relation between the change of the normal - state behavior of @xmath0 in magnetic fields and the field - induced stripe order . considering the results of the elastic neutron scattering measurements  @xcite mentioned in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , the negligibly small increase of @xmath0 below @xmath20 with increasing field for @xmath8 and 0.12 seems to indicate that the stripe order is nearly perfectly stabilized in zero field and is insensitive to the applied field .",
    "@xcite as for @xmath9 , the marked increase of @xmath0 below @xmath20 with increasing field reminds us some possible origins .",
    "the first is the normal - state magnetoresistance .",
    "however , this is not applicable , because the normal - state magnetoresistance is usually as small as an order of 1 % at 15 t , as in the case of @xmath8 and 0.12 .",
    "the second is the suppression of the superconducting fluctuation by the applied field .",
    "the positive magnetoresistance appears even at temperatures just below @xmath20 far from @xmath29 in high fields . on the other hand , reports on the nernst effect in lsco have suggested that the vortex state survives even at higher temperatures far above @xmath11 , meaning that the superconducting fluctuation exists even at high temperatures .",
    "@xcite therefore , this possible origin can not be excluded and further measurements are needed to conclude .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that this is not a candidate , because the large positive magnetoresistance is observed only for @xmath9 and not for @xmath8 nor 0.12 .",
    "the third is enhancement of the localization of holes induced by the applied field .",
    "the localization behavior of @xmath0 becomes marked with increasing field and appears to approach the behavior of lnsco with @xmath7 where the stripe order is perfectly stabilized . in the long run",
    ", the most probable origin is that the charge - spin stripe order is stabilized by the applied field in @xmath9 .",
    "this may be the first experimental evidence , to our knowledge , of the _ charge _ stripe order stabilized in magnetic fields . to be more conclusive",
    ", the neutron scattering measurements in magnetic fields are under way .",
    "vs ln@xmath10 at 15 t for la@xmath1ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lbco ) with @xmath9 , 0.11 and la@xmath5nd@xmath6sr@xmath2cuo@xmath3 ( lnsco ) with @xmath7 . ]",
    "finally , we discuss the temperature dependence of @xmath0 below @xmath20 .",
    "so far , it has been clarified in the underdoped lsco and bslco  @xcite that @xmath0 in the normal state shows the ln(1/@xmath10 ) dependence at low temperatures in magnetic fields , suggesting that the ln(1/@xmath10 ) dependence is a common feature of the underdoped high-@xmath11 cuprates . to check this suggestion , @xmath0 s of lbco with @xmath9 , 0.11 and lnsco with @xmath7 at 15 t are plotted versus ln@xmath10 , as shown in fig .",
    "below @xmath27 20 k , it is found that @xmath0 in the normal state is proportional to ln(1/@xmath10 ) in each @xmath26 , though @xmath0 deviates downward from ln(1/@xmath10 ) at low temperatures because of the superconducting transition for @xmath9 and 0.11 .",
    "the small deviation below 3 k for @xmath7 is irrelevant to the superconducting transition , because @xmath0 is independent of the field strength for @xmath39 11 t , as seen in fig .",
    "[ r - t ] .",
    "the slope of the ln(1/@xmath10 ) dependence is found to increase with increasing @xmath26 , indicating that the localization of holes becomes strong with increasing @xmath26 toward @xmath36 at 15 t.",
    "the ln(1/@xmath10 ) dependence is known to be characteristic of the weak localization and the electron - electron interaction in the two - dimensional anderson - localized state where the in - plane electrical conductivity @xmath40 actually changes in proportion to ln(1/@xmath10 ) even in magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite for @xmath9 , 0.11 and 0.12 , however , @xmath40 does not show the ln(1/@xmath10 ) dependence below @xmath20 , as in the case of the underdoped lsco .",
    "@xcite although the true origin of the ln(1/@xmath10 ) dependence of @xmath0 is not clear , the localization of holes with the ln(1/@xmath10 ) dependence observed widely in the underdoped high-@xmath11 cuprates is robust even in the stripe - ordered state of lbco and lnsco .",
    "it has been found that the superconducting transition curve shows the parallel shift by the application of magnetic field in lbco with @xmath8 and lnsco with @xmath7 where the charge - spin stripe order is formed at low temperatures .",
    "these suggest that both the superconductivity with small superconducting fluctuation and the static stripe order are realized in one sample for @xmath8 and 0.12 . for lbco with @xmath9 , the broadening in low fields changes to the parallel shift in high fields above 9 t. moreover , @xmath0 in the normal state below @xmath20 increases with increasing field up to 15 t. it is possible that these pronounced features of @xmath9 are understood in terms of the field - induced stabilization of the _ charge _ stripe order .",
    "the @xmath0 in the normal state at low temperatures has been found to be proportional to ln(1/@xmath10 ) for @xmath9 , 0.11 and 0.12 , suggesting the localization of holes with the ln(1/@xmath10 ) dependence of @xmath0 which is robust even in the stripe - ordered state of lbco and lnsco .",
