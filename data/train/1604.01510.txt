    "an eruptive solar flare is a powerful and explosive phenomenon in the solar atmosphere which can release up to 10@xmath2  ergs of energy and may lead to disastrous space weather .",
    "observations show that a flare has three phases : a pre - flare phase , an impulsive phase , and a gradual phase @xcite .",
    "post - flare loops ( pfls ) are arcade - like , developed loop systems that appear in the gradual phases of eruptive flares .",
    "pfls were first found in h@xmath3 images , where they appeared as bright loops above the solar limb @xcite .",
    "pfls have also been observed in other wavelengths , such as ultraviolet , x - ray , and radio @xcite .",
    "the loop structures of hot x - ray and cool h@xmath3 pfls extend into the corona , with their footpoints identified as h@xmath3 flare ribbons in the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "for a particular wavelength , the loop structures of pfls appear to rise and expand . for different wavelengths ,",
    "hot x - ray pfls occur earlier and higher , and cool h@xmath3 pfls show up later and lower , which indicates that the growth of pfls is a superficial phenomenon of the cooling process @xcite .",
    "two mechanisms generally contribute to the cooling process of pfls : conduction and radiation .",
    "cooling timescales for the two mechanisms can be calculated to determine which mechanism is dominating .",
    "the width and velocity of flare ribbons are used to estimate the cooling time due to conduction and radiation acting together @xcite .",
    "if the parameters of the loops , such as length , temperature , and electron density , could be learned from the multi - wavelength observations or numerical modeling , the conductive and radiative cooling times could be calculated respectively @xcite .",
    "the observations and modeling @xcite have shown that the cooling process of pfls has two phases : the conductive cooling , followed by the radiative coolings .    generally ,",
    "twisted magnetic fields store enormous energy , and that energy will be released when a flare erupts @xcite . as a part of the flare process , pfls are often explained as a result of magnetic reconnection in the standard flare model , i.e. , the cshkp model @xcite . @xcite",
    "presented a scenario about the structure and the formation of the pfl system . according to the scenario",
    ", the energetic particles from the magnetic reconnection of a flare can lead to the evaporation of the chromospheric material .",
    "then , the chromospheric material expands into the corona along reconnected magnetic field lines and causes bright pfls in high - temperature wavebands .",
    "as the hot plasma cools down to the chromospheric temperature , pfls appear in h@xmath3 images .",
    "meanwhile , thermal equilibrium in the cooling loops is unstable , and the thermal instability @xcite causes the formation of condensation downflows , which can be observed in the both legs of a pfl @xcite .",
    "such downflow is a common phenomenon on the sun . in non - flare loops of active regions ( ars ) ,",
    "thermal instability leads to catastrophic cooling and the formation of cool and dense plasma blobs @xcite .",
    "these blobs , which are called coronal rain , are often observed and increasingly studied .",
    "generally , downflows in plfs appear as dark loop - like features in extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) images , which are caused by the absorption of hydrogen and helium in the cooling process @xcite .",
    "thus , they are called dark post - flare loops ( dpfls ) in this work .",
    "although dpfls have been observed for years , little attention has been paid to their fine structures in euv wavelengths and their relationship to coronal rain @xcite .",
    "now , the unprecedented observations from the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; @xcite ) on board the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( _ sdo _ ; @xcite ) allow us to investigate the fine structures of dpfls in multiple euv wavelengths . in this work , based on _",
    "sdo_/aia data , we study dpfls and analyze their properties with the multiband euv observations of the x - class flares in solar cycle 24 . after presenting our data in section  [ data ] , we describe the observational characteristics of dpfls and calculate the cooling time in section  [ results ] . in section  [ c&d ] ,",
    "we summarize this work and give a brief discussion .",
    "in this work , we investigated 20 goes x - class flares from 2011 february to 2014 february .",
    "the flare list in table  [ tab:1 ] is taken from @xcite with permission .",
    "it contains all 19 goes x - class flares between 2011 february and 2013 august and lists their start , peak , and end times , goes classes , and the corresponding ar characteristics .",
    "two x - class flares happened in ar 11429 on 2012 march 7 and an x4.9 flare occurred in ar 11990 on 2014 february 25 .",
    "we chose ar 11429 as a target to investigate the evolution of dpfls on the solar disk in detail , and another target , ar 11990 , was chosen to study dpfls on the limb .    without atmospheric disturbance ,",
    "_ sdo _ provides high - quality images of the sun . with the high spatial resolution ( @xmath4 ) and high cadence ( 12 s ) full - disk data observed by _",
    "sdo_/aia , we can study the coronal dynamics in unprecedented detail .",
    "_ sdo_/aia provides seven euv wavelengths ( 304 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 335 , 94 , and 131  ) which cover a characteristic temperature range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 k. in this work , we studied the events in all the seven euv channels , especially in 171  for its best quality in observations of dpfls .",
    "we also used simultaneous longitudinal magnetograms from _",
    "sdo_/hmi to find the magnetic structures related to dpfls .",
    "the standard _ sdo _",
    "routines ( aia_prep.pro and hmi_prep.pro ) in the solar software ( ssw ) were used to convert level 1 data to level 1.5 .",
    "the time - series data on the disk used here were corrected for the solar rotation .",
    "on 2012 march 7 , two x - class flares happened in ar 11429 .",
    "the first one ( x5.4 ) took place at the northeastern part of the ar at 00:02 ut and the second one ( x1.3 ) erupted at 01:05 ut in southwest .",
    "the x5.4 flare was an eruptive flare with a typical two - ribbon structure .",
    "figure  [ fig:1]a shows the bright flare ribbons at 00:06 ut in the 171  channel on _",
    "sdo_/aia with the contours of longitudinal magnetic fields ( @xmath01000 and @xmath01500 g ) in blue and red colors . the east and the west flare ribbons were located in the negative magnetic polarity ( blue ) and the positive magnetic polarity ( red ) , respectively .",
    "the flare ribbons behaved as bright patches because of saturation at the flare peak time 00:24 ut .",
    "about 19 minutes later , the dpfls , the dark and loop - like features , gradually became clear among bright patches of the flare ( see figure  [ fig:1]b ) .",
    "seven identified dpfls ( d54 , d56 , d57 , d59 , d62 , d66 , and d70 ) at 02:44 ut are indicated by yellow dotted curves in figure  [ fig:1]c , and multiple dpfls were frequently observed in different loops during the evolution of the pfl system . after a four - hour evolution and expansion , the pfls became dispersed and finally disappeared within half a day ( see the associated movie ) .",
    "we tracked each identifiable dpfl of the x5.4 flare from @xmath700:50 ut , when the first one appeared , to @xmath704:50 ut , when the last one disappeared , in the 171  channel .",
    "a total of 120 dpfls were identified during these four hours .",
    "we measured the euv brightness of the dpfls almost simultaneously in the 304 , 171 , 193 , and 211  images .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:1]c , we chose a small area , the background region ( bg ) , which is without any significant coronal loops .",
    "compared to bright loops , a dpfl is a dark structure , but it is still brighter than the background .",
    "for example , the brightness of a typical dpfl ( d46 ) was only about one - fifth of that of a bright pfl ( b1 ) in each of the four channels .",
    "however , d46 was eight times brighter than the background region ( bg ) and had a similar brightness as that of a fan - like loop ( f1 ) in each of the four channels .",
    "the evolution of d46 is shown in figures  [ fig:1 ] ( d - f ) , with the same field of view outlined by the green dashed box in figure  [ fig:1]c . d46",
    "formed after a bright knot appeared near the top of the pfls ( see the small box in figure  [ fig:1]d ) . as dark downflows fell down , the shape of d46 changed dramatically and stretched to the western footpoint of the pfl . at 02:34 ut",
    ", the projected length of d46 was about 44 mm .",
    "it shortened from the top of the loop and eventually disappeared about 7 minutes later ( see figure  [ fig:1]f ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the dpfls contained tiny structures .",
    "a space - time plot was made through a slice ( a - b ) along the centerline of d46 ( see figures  [ fig:1]e and g ) .",
    "the dark lines in figure  [ fig:1]g show some blob - like falling features which were even darker than the other parts of d46 , and the size of the blob - like features were close to one pixel ( @xmath8 km ) in the image .",
    "the apparent velocity ( projected in the plane of the sky ) of the blob - like features was 81 km  s@xmath1 as shown by the dashed line in figure  [ fig:1]g .",
    "these dark parallel lines below the dashed line show earlier dark blob - like features in the same dpfl with similar velocities .",
    "we found that the blob - like features appeared in all the dpfls and usually a dpfl contained more than one blob - like feature .",
    "the apparent velocities of the blob - like features were measured as an indicator of the velocities of dpfls .",
    "most dpfls during the x5.4 flare on 2012 march 7 appeared in the 304 , 171 , 193 , and 211  channels , while parts of dpfls could be observed in all the seven euv channels of aia .",
    "figures  [ fig:2 ] ( a - g ) show d46 as a multiband example at  02:35 ut .",
    "d46 , especially the upper half of the loop , was less clear in the three high temperatures channels , 335 , 131 , and 94  , than the other four cooler channels .",
    "the difference between the upper and lower halves of the loop in the multiple euv channels may reflect the longitudinal differences of the temperature and density in the loop .",
    "it is particularly difficult to detect the upper part of the dpfl in the 94  channel ( log t = 6.8 ) , which may indicate that it had been cooled below the range of temperature response in the aia 94  channel .",
    "figure  [ fig:2]h shows the normalized euv brightness variation along the slice c - d in the seven channels . in the 171 , 193 , and 211  channels ,",
    "the brightness of d46 was less than half of that of its surroundings , which made d46 appear clearly and become more easily identifiable in these channels than in the other channels .",
    "table  [ tab:3 ] gives the average widths of the dpfls in six aia euv channels , 304 , 171 , 193 , 211 , 335 , and 131  , which have roughly rising characteristic temperatures . to compare with the previous results , the first six rows of widths were calculated through a semi - automatic procedure , which consists of tracking a loop manually , measuring the brightness variation in the cross - cutting of the loop , extracting the absorption curve from the background of the brightness variation , and counting the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of the curve automatically .",
    "the standard deviation of the widths and the number of samples are given in the third and fourth columns , respectively .",
    "the curves that under the effect of saturation or having small depths were excluded from the sample .",
    "the sample number of the 193  channel was significantly less than those of the 171 and 211  channels because the pfls in the 193  channel were saturated longer than the pfls in the 171 and 211  channels .",
    "roughly , fewer sample numbers of a channel means that it is harder to find a specific dpfl in the channel .",
    "we found that the average widths are increasing with the characteristic temperatures in the first four aia channels , 304 , 171 , 193 , and 211  , but the difference of widths among the different channels was within the range of the standard deviations .",
    "this rising trend was discontinued in the remaining two channels .",
    "the width of the aia 335  channel was slightly less than that of the 211  channel , and the width in the 131  channel was less than those of the other five channels .",
    "the 131  channel contains both high and low temperature components , which may explain its small width , large deviation , and small sample number .",
    "the difference in images , widths , and sample numbers may suggest that the dpfls have a transverse multi - temperature structures within a specific temperature range .",
    "the width in the last row , 1022@xmath0339 km , was measured manually as a reference , which reveals that the automatic widths were systematically larger than the manual widths .",
    "the sample numbers from the automatic procedure were also less than that of the manual procedure , which show that the manual procedure is important when deal with the complex situation of some dpfls .",
    "in addition to the width , we made statistical analyses for other characteristics of the 120 identified dpfls in the x5.4 flare in the 171  channel .",
    "the 120 dpfls had an average maximum length of 33@xmath010 mm and an average downflow velocity of 76@xmath019 km  s@xmath1 , respectively .",
    "as shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig:3 ] , the average brightness of the dpfls in the 171  channel decreased coincidentally with the goes soft x - ray flux , while the average downflow velocities and numbers of the dpfls did not change monotonously with time .",
    "the number of the dpfls remained relatively steady and then decreased significantly @xmath7240 minutes after the flare erupted , which indicates that multiple dpfls are often observed at the same time .",
    "the histogram in the lower panel of figure  [ fig:3 ] illustrates that one - third of the dpfls had a typical lifetime of about 6 minutes and the average lifetime was 10.0@xmath05.5 minutes .",
    "solar limb events give us another viewpoint to check the properties of dpfls . on the east solar limb ,",
    "an x4.9 flare erupted in ar 11990 at 00:39 ut on 2014 february 25 .",
    "the x4.9 flare was a typical eruptive event with peak time at 00:49 and end time at 01:03 ut .",
    "figures  [ fig:4 ]",
    "( a - c ) show the evolution of the flare event in the aia 171  channel .",
    "after the flare erupted , a filament rose slowly at 00:42 ut , and then the overlying loops opened in the field of view after the filament s quick eruption at 00:45 ut . at the same time , flare ribbons appeared and became saturated , owing to high energy in the aia 171  channel .",
    "when the saturation started to disappear , the first dpfl appeared around 01:10 ut .",
    "figure  [ fig:4]b shows that some dpfls can be clearly identified in the pfl system at 01:37 ut .",
    "most of dpfls disappeared before 03:10 ut , and the whole pfl system dispersed at @xmath704:00 ut .",
    "figures  [ fig:4 ] ( d - f ) display the evolution of a typical dpfl on the solar limb , with the same field of view outlined by the green dashed box in figure  [ fig:4]c .",
    "similar to the on - disk case , the dpfl appeared after a bright knot near the top of the pfls ( see the small box in figure  [ fig:4]d ) .",
    "then the dpfl stretched to the western footpoint as downflows fell down ( see figure  [ fig:4]f ) .",
    "about 10 minutes after the dpfl appeared , it shortened and eventually disappeared . a slice ( e - f ) along the centerline of the dpfl is used to make a space - time plot ( see figure  [ fig:4]g ) .",
    "the dotted lines in figure  [ fig:4]g show that a blob - like feature in the dpfl was accelerated from @xmath745 km  s@xmath1 to @xmath7107 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "some dark lines parallel to the dotted lines show the other earlier or later blob - like features in the same dpfl and indicate similar velocities .",
    "figure  [ fig:5 ] displays the various appearances of dpfls in three different aia channels ( 131 , 171 , and 304  ) and shows the loop structures at different heights from the side . as shown in figure  [ fig:5]a , bright pfls were expanded above the solar limb , and a cusp was located above the pfls in the aia 131  channel .",
    "some high - speed falling features , which were also above the pfls , were observed around the cusp in high corona .",
    "the dpfls in the 171  channel were clearer than those in other channels ( see the dotted line in figure  [ fig:5]b ) .",
    "the dpfls and the high loops were weak in the cool 304 image ( log t = 4.7 ) from the side view in figure  [ fig:5]c .",
    "we studied the evolution of loop structures at different heights using a slice ( g - h ) in the 131 and 171  channel .",
    "the slice is throughout the cusp and approximately perpendicular to the top of the pfls ( see the dashed lines in figures  [ fig:5]a and b ) .",
    "figures  [ fig:5 ] ( d - e ) show space - time plots which are made by the slice g - h in the 131 and 171  channels , respectively .",
    "each space - time plot is divided into two parts that respectively represent the high and low corona , by the dashed and dotted line ( k - l ) .    in these two channels , the evolution of loop structures is distinct at different heights . in the high corona",
    ", loops shrank and oscillated along the slice , and the amplitude of the oscillation decreased with time in the 171  channel . some high - speed falling features with velocities of @xmath7100  km  s@xmath1",
    "were observed in the 131  channel .",
    "the effect of solar rotation on the calculation of the velocities was negated by the track of loop footpoints . in the low corona",
    ", the pfls in the 131  channel rose rapidly with an apparent velocity ( @xmath9 ) of 123 km  s@xmath1 , then slowed to 17 km  s@xmath1 before the point p , and finally turned to a speed of 7 km  s@xmath1 with the opposite direction . on the other hand , @xmath9 of the pfls in the aia 171  channel",
    "could be divided into at least four stages .",
    "@xmath9 was about 48  km  s@xmath1 in the first stage , decreased to 14  km  s@xmath1 in the second stage , continuously decreased to an average @xmath9 of 3.7  km  s@xmath1 in the third stage , and finally became to 1.2  km  s@xmath1 in the last stage .",
    "dpfls appeared in the third and fourth stage , which belong to the decay phase ( the latter part of gradual phase ) of the flare .",
    "so @xmath9 was 3.71.2  km  s@xmath1 during the period of the dpfls , and these velocities are used to calculate the cooling time in section  [ cooling process ] .",
    "besides the distinctions , we also found some connections between different heights and channels .",
    "the erupting filament appeared in both the 131 and 171  channels .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of the dpfls is related to the movement of the pfl system .",
    "the dpfls in the 171  channel started to appear when the @xmath9 in the 131  channel turned to the opposite direction at @xmath701:10 ut ( see the point p in figure  [ fig:5]d ) .",
    "most dpfls disappeared around 03:10 ut , when @xmath9 was approximately zero and the top of the pfls was close to the dividing line k - l . on the other side of the dividing line ,",
    "falling features in the 131  channel decelerated as they get closer to the dividing line .",
    "after the effect of solar rotation was removed , we found that the height of the dividing line was not change with time .",
    "as mentioned above , dpfls are derived from the cooling process of a pfl system which mainly includes two mechanisms , conduction and radiation .",
    "we can determine which mechanism predominates by respectively calculating the conductive and radiative cooling time @xcite .",
    "the conductive cooling timescale ( @xmath10 ) of the loops is calculated by @xmath11 where @xmath12  erg  k@xmath1 is the boltzman constant and @xmath13  erg  s@xmath1  cm@xmath1  k@xmath15 is the thermal spitzer conductivity coefficient @xcite .",
    "@xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the temperature , electron density , and half - length of loops , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab:2 ] gives some previous results of the temperature , electron density , half - length , cooling time , and ascending velocity of pfls .",
    "since values of physical parameters ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ) depend on observational wavelengths and change greatly during a flare process @xcite , here we select @xmath19  k and @xmath20  @xmath21 based on the references in table  [ tab:2 ] and the characteristic temperature of the aia 171  channel @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath22  cm as a lower limit value of @xmath18 to get a lower limit of @xmath10 . by substituting the parameters to equation  [ eq:2 ]",
    ", we obtain @xmath23  s , which is still longer than the duration of the flare process .    on the other hand , under the hypothesis of full ionization and with the piece - wide power law approximation from @xcite , the radiative cooling timescale ( @xmath24 )",
    "is determined by @xmath25 where @xmath26  erg  s@xmath1  @xmath27 is the radiative loss rate at @xmath28  k @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath29  s. in section  [ dod ] , we found that the dpfls have a typical lifetime of 6 minutes , which is close to @xmath24 .",
    "moreover , it was found that the cooling time can be estimated by using the velocity and the width of the flare ribbons @xcite .",
    "the pfls are observed expanding in a particular wavelength during the cooling process .",
    "@xcite suggested that the cooling time of loops is approximately equal to the characteristic growing time of pfls .",
    "so we can estimate the cooling timescale in a particular wavelength by using the movement of pfls .",
    "the cooling timescale ( @xmath30 ) is estimated by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the width of the loop and @xmath9 is the ascending velocity of the pfls . in this work , @xmath33  km and @xmath34  km  s@xmath1 , and we obtain @xmath35  s , which reflects a combination of the two cooling mechanisms in the aia 171  channel .",
    "the results show that lifetime and @xmath30 are comparable with @xmath24 but are much less than @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , the cooling process of dpfls is dominated by the radiation and the conductive cooling for dpfls can be neglected during the decaying phase of an x - class flare .",
    "twenty goes x - class flares between 2011 february and 2014 february were investigated and had similar features for dpfls .",
    "the dpfls can be identified in all the 20 x - class flares and their appearance and disappearance time are listed in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "most of them appeared after the end of the goes flares , and then they developed during an average period of 4 hr , and finally disappeared .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] gives snapshots of the dpfls during four flares in the 171  channel of aia .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:6]a , the pfls of an eruptive x1.4 flare that occurred in ar 11302 at 10:29 ut expanded above the east limb of the sun on 2011 september 22 .",
    "the first dpfl appeared about one hour after the x1.4 flare erupted , and the last one disappeared about nine hours after the flare erupted .",
    "figure  [ fig:6]b shows the dpfls of an x1.9 flare in the same ar at 16:01 ut , 2011 september 24 .",
    "the x1.9 flare erupted at 09:21 ut with complicated pfls .",
    "figure  [ fig:6]c shows that the dpfls of an x1.7 flare at 19:57 ut on 2012 january 27 .",
    "this flare began at 17:37 ut in ar 11402 above the west limb of the sun .",
    "the fourth example ( figure  [ fig:6]d ) is an x1.4 flare that erupted at 15:37 on 2012 july 12 in ar 11520 near the center of the solar disk .",
    "the dpfls emerged at @xmath717:30 ut and disappeared at @xmath723:29 ut .",
    "using the euv observations from _ sdo_/aia , we studied dpfls in eruptive flares and found blob - like features in dpfls . in this work",
    ", the properties of dpfls were investigated by analyzing the euv data with high spatial and temporal resolutions .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows :    * dpfls were found in 20 x - class flares between 2011 february and 2014 february .",
    "most of the dpfls appeared after the end of the goes flares , and lasted for a period of about 4 hr . * the dpfls were most distinct in the _ sdo_/aia euv 171  channel .",
    "most of the dpfls were noticeable in the images of 304 , 171 , 193 , and 211  , while some of them could be found in all euv wavelengths of _ sdo_/aia .",
    "* the euv brightness of the dpfls was actually brighter than that of the background region , with an evolution similar to that of goes x - ray flux . *",
    "the dpfls of the x5.4 flare had an average lifetime of 10.0@xmath05.5 minutes , an average width of 1022@xmath0339 km , and an average maximum length of 33@xmath010 mm .",
    "* the dpfls contained multiple blob - like features with a size close to the resolution of sdo / aia .",
    "the blob - like features in the dpfls of the x5.4 flare had an average velocity of 76@xmath019 km  s@xmath1 . * the cooling time of the x4.9 flare was 276852",
    "s during its decaying phase , and the cooling process was dominated by the radiation . *",
    "the average widths of the dpfls slightly increase with the characteristic temperatures in the aia 304 , 171 , 193 , and 211  channels . *",
    "the comparison among multiple euv channels reflects the presence of longitudinal and transverse temperature structures in the dpfls .    in this work , we observed dpfls in all the sample flares , which suggests dpfls are a common phenomenon in the decay phase of x - class flare events .",
    "the results confirmed that the dpfls originate from the cooling process due to the thermal instability in pfls .",
    "the blob - like features in dpfls behaved like coronal rain in non - flare ar loops .",
    "these blob - like features are most likely produced by the same mechanism that creates coronal rain , but with a different amount of mass from the chromospheric evaporation .",
    "the relationship between the widths of dpfls and the characteristic temperatures of the euv channels is consistent with the pervious results , and it suggests the existence of multi - temperature structures and a transition of temperature from the chromosphere to the corona @xcite . considering their locations and velocities , the high - speed falling features above the pfls in the aia 131 images are probably supra - arcade downflows @xcite .",
    "supra - arcade downflows and dpfls have an apparent correlation in time and location , but it is unclear if they are intrinsically related due to the magnetic reconnection .",
    "future investigations are needed to answer these questions .",
