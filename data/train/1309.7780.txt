    "this implies that the crystal length @xmath113 is on the order of 10 mm or more , so the strongly phase - mismatched ( cascading ) limit @xmath114 is always fulfilled .",
    "this means that the sh conversion is weak , even for high fw intensities , and thus that kerr self - phase and cross - phase modulation of the sh is insignificant .",
    "they are instead both very relevant for the fw , but this is not what we investigate here . finally , @xmath33 is the effective @xmath34 nonlinearity .",

( [ eq : ansatz ] ) . a normalized ( how it is normalized is discussed later ) nonlocal response function is here introduced as @xmath122 which turns out to be inherently dimensionless .",
    "we see from this result that the sh becomes `` slaved '' or `` locked '' to the fw : the sh spectral density for a transform - limited fw is therefore @xmath123 . for a chirped fw",
    "the relation becomes more complicated ( @xmath124 ^ 2|\\neq |e_1(\\omega)|^2 $ ] ) , and one can no longer simply consider sh spectrum as a product of the fw spectral intensity and the nonlocal response function .",
    "the ansatz eq .",
    "( [ eq : ansatz ] ) reflects the strong cascading limit ( @xmath115 ) , where it is assumed that the phase - mismatch is so large that the coherence length @xmath125 is much smaller than any other characteristic length scales ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , it turns out to work quite very well even when one of the other length scales become similar in size . an important length scale in this comparison is the quadratic nonlinear length scale defined through the traditional @xmath126-parameter @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the peak electric input field .",
    "the ansatz holds when @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "the ansatz looks for solutions that are stationary in @xmath40 , and this only happens when the fw can be assumed undepleted , but also when the fw phase does not change with @xmath40 ; remember from eq .",

    "it marks the threshold between the non - resonant ( @xmath133 ) and resonant regimes @xmath130 . in the latter",
    "the resonant nonlocal behaviour occurs because denominator will have two real roots , leading to resonant peaks in @xmath50 .",
    "these resonance frequencies are to 2 .",
    "order @xmath134 this result was also found in @xcite using a different approach , but essentially taking the same key assumptions ; this will be discussed later .",
    "instead when @xmath133 the nonlocal response is non - resonant : the resonance peaks disappears and the nonlocal response is ultrabroadband .",
    "this is the optimal situation for few - cycle pulse compression @xcite ( see also recent discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "let us now show how the cascading leads to a nonlocal kerr - like nonlinearity : using the convolution theorem @xmath135 , where @xmath136 $ ] is the inverse fourier transform of the response function .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : rnonlocal - a ] ) is defined so @xmath137 ; this is the basis of the normalization discussed above . inserting @xmath138 into eq .",

    "this nonlocal kerr - like nonlinearity is non - resonant in frequency domain when @xmath133 and resonant in frequency domain when @xmath130 . in the latter case",
    "the temporal nonlocal response function is oscillatory in time domain @xmath142 with some characteristic oscillation time @xmath143 .",
    "finally , in the local limit where the fw spectrum is very narrow we can make the approximation that @xmath144 is constant inside the spectrum , and thus @xmath145 .",
    "this is the instantaneous kerr - like nonlinearity induced by cascading .",
    "it will be competing with the intrinsic material cubic nonlinearity @xmath146 , and effectively the fw will experience a total nonlinear refractive index change @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the fw intensity and the material kerr nonlinear refractive index is @xmath149 . when including the next order in the local - limit expansion an additional cascading - induced self - steepening term results @xcite , equivalent to the term found in @xcite using a perturbative approach .",
    "let us now discuss the traditional approach based on phase - matched sidebands : in absence of phase matching between the center frequency @xmath2 and @xmath61 , phase - matched shg of a pulsed beam can occur using a sideband frequency in the fw spectrum @xmath58 , which then generates a sh at @xmath59 that is detuned from @xmath61 .",
    "this explains the detuned sh peak observed . obviously changing the amount of phase mismatch of the center frequencies",
    "changes the sh detuned frequency that can be phase - matched also changes , which explains the tunability .    in order to quantify this , it is well known that under the undepleted fw approximation ( @xmath148 is constant in @xmath40 ) the sh intensity obeys the equation @xmath150 which can be derived directly from eq .",
    "( [ eq : shg - sh - a ] ) by integrating over @xmath40 and neglecting sh dispersion ; the `` undepleted fw '' assumption also implies that the fw does not depend on @xmath40 , and therefore can be taken constant in this integration .",
    "we now study the chromatic variation of the phase - matching condition @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath151 : when @xmath152 we may look for a phase - matching point detuned away from the fw frequency @xmath58 , but where frequency conservation is obeyed @xmath59 . graphically , the sinc - function at phase matching is centered at @xmath61 , but in absence of phase matching it is shifted to a new frequency @xmath153 . focusing on a sideband @xmath154 to the sh frequency",
    "this can be written as @xmath155 , and expanding it we get @xmath156 .",
    "when @xmath157 , phase - matching occurs at the frequency offsets @xmath158 accurate up to 2 .",
    "we see that the condition for having phase - matched sidebands , @xmath157 , is reminiscent of the resonance condition we employed for the nonlocal theory . if we express it through the phase - mismatch parameter it becomes @xmath159 when @xmath160 .",
    "note that an analytical result for the detuned sh frequency was calculated previously @xcite taking into account only gvm ( i.e. accurate to 1 .",
    "order only ) .",
    "this approach is quite phenomenological , because the undepleted fw result eq .",
    "( [ eq : sh - sinc ] ) is based on the monochromatic phase mismatch @xmath29 .",
    "any direct influence of the fw dispersion is absent from this equation , and can therefore not play a role in the analysis .",
    "however , it intuitively makes sense that we may `` track '' the phase - mismatch variation vs. frequency and therefore make the generalization to @xmath151 .",
    "the nonlocal approach also highlights how easily the sh higher - order dispersion is taken into account to describe dispersion beyond the monochromatic phase - mismatch parameter , and in fact a sinc - like result can be derived in the case where sh dispersion is present ( see @xcite ) .      to see this",
    ", we follow the approach in @xcite .",
    "the first step is standard , and introduces an auxiliary sh amplitude @xmath35 so the sh equation becomes @xmath161b_2+\\tfrac{\\omega_1 d_{\\rm eff}}{cn_2 } e_1 ^ 2=0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in fourier domain this can be written as @xmath162\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath163 is the effective sh dispersion operator in frequency domain . to solve this we first look for solutions to the homogeneous equation @xmath164 , which are on the form @xmath165 . under the assumption that @xmath41 $ ] does not depend on @xmath40 a particular solution @xmath39",

    "we also mention that the nonlocal result is recovered in this process : the particular solution ( [ eq : b2p ] ) is namely exactly equivalent to the nonlocal result derived in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sh - locked - a ] ) .",
    "this is also what is denoted as the `` driven '' wave in @xcite , and it should not be surprising that the particular solution found by assuming a @xmath40-independent behavior is identical to the nonlocal result . instead the homogeneous part , denoted as the `` free '' wave in @xcite , is neglected in the nonlocal approach , but it describes the well - known temporal walk - off wave that travels away from the fw after one gvm length @xmath174 and moves with the sh group velocity ( and evidently also becomes affected by the sh hod , cf .",
    "the @xmath175 phase term ) .    still the fw dispersion is elusive in these approaches .",
    "we here note that the fw dispersion can indirectly affect the sh through the fw `` source term '' , @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "even when the undepleted fw assumption holds , a phase can namely be accumulated due to dispersion .",
    "this does make the source term @xmath40-dependent , and in order to show the consequence a more rigorous analysis is required .",
    "an example is found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where they for simplicity keep the sh dispersion absent ( thus no gvm or sh gvd ) . in the weak fw gvd regime (",
    "they use this approximation because they need to keep the fw amplitude constant in @xmath40 allowing only the phase to change in order to solve it analytically ; in this approximation they are therefore neglecting that the gvd induces a decreasing peak fw intensity as the fw is spread out temporally ) they derive a result similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sh - sinc ] ) where in the sinc - term the @xmath0 term has a contribution from the fw gvd in exactly the same way as by expanding the phase mismatch to include higher - order dispersion terms .",
    "this indicates that the phenomenological expansion of the phase - mismatch parameter is correct .",
    "we can be a bit more specific .",
    "consider the case where the fw pulse , initially gaussian @xmath176 , becomes affected by gvd . in the fourier domain the initial pulse is @xmath177 .",
    "the gvd manifests itself through the buildup of a quadratic phase , so the pulse becomes @xmath178\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] inverse fourier transforming we get @xmath179\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and evaluating the intensity we get @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the fw dispersion length ; this is the classic result that as the pulse propagates along @xmath40 it spreads out in time and its peak intensity drops correspondingly .",
    "the peculiar feature is that in the fourier domain the amplitude is not affected by @xmath40 , only the phase is , but this property is unfortunately not conserved once we square the field and fourier transform it . instead we get @xmath182=\\frac{e_{1,\\rm in}^2t_0}{\\sqrt{2(1-i zk_1^{(2)}/t_0 ^ 2 ) } } \\exp\\left[-\\omega^2t_0 ^ 2/4+izk_1^{(2)}\\omega^2/4\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is exactly the amplitude prefactor @xmath183^{-\\tfrac{1}{2}}$ ] that violates the assumption about a stationary ( @xmath40-independent ) source term .",
    "however , for a small fw gvd , i.e. when @xmath184 , we can neglect the variation of the amplitude .",
    "then we readily see that an additional phase @xmath185 is added to the source term .",
    "we therefore introduce a new auxiliary function @xmath186 , and the analysis from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sh - valiulis - fd ] ) remains the same , i.e. we solve for @xmath187 and replace @xmath188 .",
    "this shows that expansion of the @xmath0 part in the sinc - term of the classical sh conversion result corresponds to allowing the fw dispersion to change the phase of the fw field but not the amplitude , which must remain unchanged .",
    "we also note that the slaved / driven solution , i.e. what the nonlocal theory actually derives , will also be affected by such a fw gvd phase .",
    "it seems clear from these considerations that the only difference between the two cases is the assumption posed on the fw .",
    "the phase - matched sidebands theory assumes that the fw follows the material dispersion .",
    "the nonlocal theory as a starting point assumes that the fw is not affected by higher - order dispersion , and only carries a phase and a group velocity .",
    "however , in both cases any effect of the fw dispersion to the theoretical result must come from releasing this assumption . in both cases",
    "this is handled by the same approximation , so at the end it is just a matter of choice whether the fw gvd will play a factor or not , and not a restriction .",
    "a well - known example of a fw that does not disperse nor change its amplitude in @xmath40 , is the temporal soliton ; it is merely described by a phase and a group velocity , and no other higher - order dispersion terms .",
    "the nonlocal theory is therefore a soliton - based approach while the traditional phase - matched sidebands theory is a dispersive ( non - solitonic ) approach .",
    "we finally note that one can obviously generalize the frequency resonance derivations as well as the discussions above to include higher - order dispersion , but this will eventually require semi - analytical or numerical solutions . in the theoretical curves presented in the paper we use `` exact '' dispersion , where no polynomial expansion is used and the refractive indices used are from the material sellmeier equations .",
    "the solutions are therefore found numerically .",

    "<S> our results remain unchanged : one can still find a resonant regime close to phase matching , and essentially in the nonlocal response function @xmath0 must be replaced by the effective qpm phase mismatch @xmath107 , see @xcite . however , when using qpm to reduce the effective phase - mismatch to a non - zero level ( to achieve cascading ) there are usually some higher - order qpm processes that become very nearly phase - matched . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is typical to observe numerous resonant peaks in the sh spectrum , see e.g. @xcite .    in summary , phase - mismatched shg of femtosecond pulses in a thick crystal leads to the formation of a dominating compressed peak in the sh spectrum . </S>",
