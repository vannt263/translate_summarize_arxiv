    "the highly active star forming region known as the orion molecular cloud 2/3 region ( hereafter , omc 2/3 ) is located in a molecular filament @xcite in the northernmost part of the orion a molecular cloud at a distance of 450 pc @xcite .",
    "this region contains one of the richest concentrations of protostars and prestellar cores known .",
    "thirty - four submillimeter sources have been detected in omc 2/3 at 1300 @xmath5 m and 350 @xmath5 m , evidence that it is a site of vigorous star formation activity @xcite .",
    "all six condensations in omc 3 , the northernmost part of omc 2/3 , fit the definition of class 0 object , l@xmath6/l@xmath7 @xmath8 200 , and thus are in the earliest stages of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "in addition , at least 80 knots of h@xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 emission , signifying jets and outflows , have been detected in omc 2/3 , confirming the region s extreme youth @xcite .",
    "although omc 2/3 has such a high density of star - forming cores , as shown by the richness of submillimeter sources , the population of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars and young brown dwarfs has not been studied as extensively or to similar depth in the infrared as the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) , which is directly south of omc 2/3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as part of a study to survey the pms star population in omc 2/3 , we present the results of a survey of young brown dwarfs . with",
    "the existence of brown dwarfs firmly established , attention has shifted towards understanding the formation mechanism .",
    "@xcite proposed that brown dwarfs are formed by the ejection of accreting `` stellar embryos '' from dynamically unstable systems of protostars , resulting in the premature termination of accretion and substellar masses .",
    "our study of brown dwarfs in omc 2/3 was initially motivated by this proposal ; the detection of a large number of brown dwarfs around class 0 sources would be evidence for ejection at slow velocities .",
    "@xcite suggest that given the amount of star formation activity , this would be the best place to find both very young brown dwarfs and potentially proto - brown dwarfs , and hence test models of their formation .",
    "a more detailed discussion of brown dwarf formation in omc 2/3 will be discussed in a subsequent paper on _ spitzer _ colors of the confirmed young brown dwarfs presented in this paper .    in order to obtain a complete census of the young brown dwarfs in omc 2/3 ( and eventually determine whether they are likely to have circumstellar disks ) , near - infrared observations are critical for identification .",
    "we performed near - infrared observations that are two to three magnitudes deeper than the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in order to identify the most deeply embedded substellar objects in omc 2/3 , down to 25 , based on 1  myr isochrones @xcite . before 2mass",
    ", near - infrared observations of omc 2/3 reached @xmath12band magnitudes of 12.20 magnitudes @xcite ; as a comparison , for our near - infrared observations we reach a magnitude limit of @xmath13 17.9 .",
    "near - infrared and visible wavelength imaging and spectroscopy provide the information necessary for the selection and confirmation of substellar objects in star - forming regions .",
    "young brown dwarfs , with ages much less than 10  myr , are much more luminous and thus easier to detect than field brown dwarfs ( typically older than 1  gyr ) at distances greater than 100 pc .",
    "however , the near - infrared colors of young brown dwarfs are similar to those of very low mass stars making it difficult to identify brown dwarfs from near - infrared photometry alone .",
    "therefore techniques developed by @xcite are applied to select brown dwarf candidates in omc 2/3 from combined , deep near - infrared and visible wavelength photometry .",
    "once candidate brown dwarfs are photometrically selected , far - red ( 0.6@xmath01.0 @xmath5 m ) and near - infrared ( 0.8@xmath02.5 @xmath5 m ) spectroscopic observations are used to confirm the candidates as _ bona fide _ brown dwarfs .    we present a multiwavelength analysis of the omc 2/3 region to identify the population of young brown dwarfs . in section [ sec : observations ] , we introduce the ground - based imaging of the omc 2/3 region .",
    "next , in section [ sec : selection ] , we describe the techniques used for selecting candidate young brown dwarfs for spectroscopy using the multiwavelength photometry . then , we describe the spectroscopic observations ( section [ sec : specobs ] ) and the spectral type classification methods used as well as the spectral types determined from the spectra ( section [ sec : spectral_typing ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the age of omc 2/3 in section [ sec : omc23age ] .",
    "the near - infrared observations of omc 2/3 were obtained with sqiid @xcite , the simultaneous quad infrared imaging device on the 2.1-meter telescope at kitt peak national observatory during the period of 2000 december 11@xmath013 .",
    "the conditions were non - photometric , with thin clouds , and the seeing was around 2@xmath14 ( closer to 1.8@xmath14 in @xmath12band ) .",
    "sqiid utilizes a 1024 @xmath2 1024 insb detector array with independent 512 @xmath2 512 quadrants that are filtered at barr j ( 1.27 ) , barr h ( 1.67 ) , barr k ( 2.22 ) and barr pah ( 3.30 ) .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : image_dist ] , our sqiid image mosaic toward omc 2/3 totals a 20@xmath1 @xmath2 20@xmath1 field of view centered slightly north of omc 2 , @xmath4 = 05@xmath15 35@xmath16 22.8@xmath17 , @xmath18 = @xmath19 6@xmath1 37.1@xmath14 ( j2000 ) , at @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( no useful data were obtained at 3.30 @xmath5 m with sqiid ) .",
    "these wide - field mosaics were obtained by mapping the region in a 4 @xmath2 4 grid with approximately 90   of overlap between images in adjacent grid positions .",
    "each image in the grid has 512 @xmath2 512 pixels ; with a platescale of 0.69/pixel , the total size of the final mosaic is 20@xmath1 @xmath2 20@xmath1 .",
    "the 4 @xmath2 4 map was repeated seven times with slightly offset positions each time ; the typical total integration time for each image is 7 minutes .",
    "customized interactive data language ( idl ) programs were implemented to perform the image reduction including linearity , flat fielding , background subtraction , the elimination of bad pixels , and distortion correction , as well as creation of individual mosaics and aperture photometry .",
    "calibration of the sqiid observations was done by comparison with 2mass photometry ; thin clouds were present during the observations , and thus the data were not calibrated with standard stars . to properly compare the 2mass stellar magnitudes with the magnitudes of the sources in our sqiid images ,",
    "15@xmath030 stars were chosen for calibration in each of the sixteen fields .",
    "stars which were determined by @xcite to show variability were not among those included for calibration .",
    "in addition , sources brighter than the saturation limits of @xmath23 10.31 , @xmath24 10.06 and @xmath25 9.45 as well as sources fainter than the 2mass completeness limits were not included . each 512 @xmath2 512 pixel frame",
    "was calibrated individually by finding the offset between the instrumental magnitudes derived in that frame and the magnitudes from the 2mass point source catalog for each selected source .",
    "the rms scatter of the residuals between the 2mass and sqiid data sets ranges from 0.05 to 0.08 magnitudes ; this is on the order of the typical uncertainty in the instrumental magnitude for sqiid ( for which the maximum allowed was 0.15 magnitudes ) .",
    "after the calibrated frames were combined into mosaics , we compared the photometry from our calibrated sqiid mosaics with 2mass to look for systematic offsets between the two systems ( mainly due to the difference in the k bandpasses ) and found the following relations :    @xmath26    @xmath27    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a @xmath30 filter . over 350 stars in each band",
    "were used to calculate these relationships ; all have photometric uncertainties less than 0.10 magnitudes .    once the images were calibrated , idl routines including photvis , a graphical interface for the idl aperture photometry routine @xcite , were used to perform aperture photometry on the final image mosaics .",
    "a synthetic aperture radius of 3 pixels was used with a small sky annulus of 2 pixels in width ( identical to that used for calibration ) .",
    "the final source list contained 823 sources that appeared in all three bands with photometric uncertainties less than 0.15 magnitudes ; only sources with photometric uncertainties less than 0.15 magnitudes were used for analysis .",
    "note that the photometric uncertainties tabulated throughout this paper do not take into account the uncertainties in the absolute calibration discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "the tabulated uncertainties are calculated ( by photvis ) from the expected shot noise and read noise and the measured rms variations in the background annulus .",
    "the limiting magnitudes reached with the detection criteria were @xmath31 19.4 , @xmath32 18.3 and @xmath13 17.9 .",
    "we derived 90% completeness limits by adding synthetic stars to our images for a range of magnitudes using a gaussian psf with the same fwhm as that of our images and performing the same point source extraction .",
    "measurements were rejected if they had photometric uncertainties greater than 0.15 magnitudes and if the recovered magnitude was more than 3@xmath33 brighter than the input magnitude , indicating that a star was likely coincident with a synthetic star .",
    "table [ table : complete_summary ] lists the magnitude at which 90% of the stars were recovered for the @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath12bands . for comparison ,",
    "published completeness limits for 2mass are @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 magnitudes ( where source counts are @xmath39 99% complete at the s / n=10 limits ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the visible wavelength images were obtained under photometric conditions with @xmath402.5@xmath14 seeing , 2002 december 7 using the 4-shooter camera on the 1.2-meter telescope at fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) .",
    "the 4-shooter camera has four 2048@xmath22048 arrays , arranged in a 2@xmath22 grid with 45   separation between chips .",
    "the images were binned 2@xmath22 during readout , resulting in a pixel scale of 0.67/pixel .",
    "the final 20@xmath1 @xmath2 20@xmath1 field was centered to match the sqiid images .",
    "omc 2/3 was imaged at harris i ( 8100  ) and @xmath41 ( 9100  ) , twice at each band with an integration time of 20 minutes each , for a total of 40 minutes at each wavelength .",
    "similar steps were taken to reduce the images as for the sqiid images , including bias subtraction , flat fielding , the elimination of bad pixels , and distortion correction .",
    "the standard stars used to calibrate the 4-shooter images of omc 2/3 are from the @xcite sa98 - 670 and sa98 - 618 fields .",
    "the @xmath42band data were calibrated from standards in the cousins i system without including a color dependence term because the @xmath42band filter at flwo is similar .",
    "since @xmath41 magnitudes are not tabulated in @xcite , the @xmath41 magnitudes were estimated from the @xmath42band magnitudes of standard stars with neutral colors .",
    "the stars in the @xcite fields with @xmath43 colors less than 0.4 were used , and @xmath44 = 0 assumed .",
    "using this calibration for our @xmath41 magnitudes is sufficient because these data are only used to identify young low mass candidates from background sources .",
    "each standard field was imaged twice over the course of the night so that an airmass correction could be accounted for in the calibration .",
    "aperture photometry was obtained using a radius of 6 pixels with a sky annulus of 4 pixels in width for both the standard stars used for calibration and for the omc 2/3 sources .",
    "the rms scatter of the residuals for the @xcite standard stars imaged with the 4-shooter is less than 0.05 magnitudes ; this calibration uncertainty is on the order of the typical intrinsic photometric uncertainties for the 4-shooter observations .",
    "only sources with photometric uncertainties less than 0.15 magnitudes were used in our analysis ( as with the data , calibration uncertainties are not included in the tabulated uncertainties ) .",
    "completeness limits for were analyzed in the same way as for the data ( see section [ sec : sqiidimaging ] ) and are also listed in table [ table : complete_summary ] .",
    "the completeness limits for the visible wavelength photometry were difficult to assess because of nebulosity from the onc in the southern part of the image .",
    "therefore the 90% completeness limits quoted in table [ table : complete_summary ] are for the region north of a declination of @xmath45 ; if we include the entire image in our analysis , the magnitudes quoted in table [ table : complete_summary ] are 80% complete .",
    "candidate young brown dwarfs in omc 2/3 are selected from the merged sqiid and 4-shooter photometry .",
    "brown dwarfs are identified by two criteria : their low luminosity and , when they are detected in the @xmath42band , their red colors .",
    "these candidates still require confirmation with spectroscopic observations , though , to eliminate contamination from faint background stars and to distinguish between older low mass stars both in omc 2/3 and in the foreground .",
    "the candidates are selected for follow - up spectroscopy in the far - red , and in cases where they are too faint to detect in the @xmath42band , in the near - infrared .    to search for brown dwarfs on the basis of their low luminosities ,",
    "candidates are initially selected from their positions on an @xmath21 versus @xmath46 color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , as shown in figure [ fig : double2 ] .",
    "the models of @xcite show that the hydrogen burning limit ( hbl ) for solar metallicity objects is at 0.075 m@xmath47 .",
    "however , given the uncertainty in the ages of the sources , we consider a `` soft boundary '' of 0.080 m@xmath47 to be used to guide the selection of objects and not as the precise location of the hbl . to find the corresponding luminosity ,",
    "an age and distance must be adopted and we adopt a distance of 450 pc and an age of 1  myr .",
    "several recent studies of the distance to orion place the distance closer , consistent with a value of 420 pc @xcite . since this result was published after our analysis , we use 450 pc throughout this paper .",
    "uncertainties that arise from this are discussed in section [ sec : lbol ] . adopting an age of 1  myr",
    "is motivated by both the concentration of young protostellar objects in this region and the age of the neighboring onc ( @xmath8 1@xmath02 myr ; @xcite ) .",
    "using the 1  myr evolutionary tracks of @xcite and the spectral type versus effective temperature scale from @xcite , the spectral type corresponding to a mass of 0.080 m@xmath47 is approximately m6@xmath0m6.5 ; in this paper , we use m6.5 as the fiducial boundary between stellar and substellar objects .    at the faint magnitudes typical of young brown dwarfs , contamination by background stars is considerable .",
    "studies of the taurus and ic 348 young clusters @xcite have shown that members of a young population can be separated from background stars using visible and near - infrared wavelength cmds ( e.g. @xmath21 versus @xmath48 ) . as @xcite showed with the taurus region ,",
    "background stars follow a different locus than cluster members . therefore the @xcite techniques of using combined , deep near - infrared and visible wavelength photometry to select brown dwarf candidates for spectral observations are used here for omc 2/3 .    for the candidate selection",
    ", we first placed all the sources detected at that fell below the 0.080 m@xmath47 reddening vector in the @xmath21 versus @xmath46 cmd ( figure [ fig : double2 ] ) on a @xmath48 versus @xmath46 color - color diagram and a dereddened , @xmath21 versus @xmath48 cmd .",
    "figure [ fig : dereddened ] shows how the spectroscopically confirmed brown dwarfs in omc 2/3 are located in a very limited region of a dereddened , @xmath21 versus @xmath48 cmd , as was also seen in taurus @xcite .",
    "we note that there are a few sources located in this region of the cmd with colors and magnitudes similar to the brown dwarfs which we have not obtained spectra of because they were too faint . for the initial candidate list , we selected sources with dereddened @xmath35band magnitudes greater than 13 and with dereddened @xmath48 colors greater than or equal to 3 .",
    "although a @xmath48 versus @xmath46 color - color diagram and @xmath49 versus @xmath44 cmd are not shown here , they were also useful for candidate selection when comparing with reddening vectors for sources less massive than 0.080 m@xmath47 .",
    "the dereddened @xmath48 color is used as a proxy for temperature for sources with @xmath42band detections .",
    "the dereddening is performed using the extinction law of @xcite and adopting a typical @xmath50 color of 0.6 ( see appendix [ sec : lbol_teff ] for a complete description ) . by identifying sources with @xmath48 colors consistent with young brown dwarfs ( @xmath51 3 ) ,",
    "as seen in taurus , we reduce contamination both from faint background stars and from older low mass stars in omc 2/3 and the foreground .    for highly extinguished sources ( i.e. sources that did not have @xmath42band , and in some cases , @xmath34band detections )",
    ", we rely on their dereddened luminosity and colors in the near - infrared alone , which makes it difficult to distinguish cool , substellar members from background stars : giants as well as older , higher temperature dwarfs along the line of sight . the candidate brown dwarfs selected for near - infrared spectroscopy were chosen because they met several criteria .",
    "first , their @xmath12band magnitudes range from 13 to 16 magnitudes ( where k = 16 is the magnitude limit reached with spex ) and they fall below the 0.080 m@xmath47 reddening vector on the @xmath20 versus   cmd and/or @xmath22 versus   cmd ( see figure [ fig : irtfpropfigs2003 ] ) . in the cmd",
    ", brown dwarfs confirmed from far - red spectroscopy are denoted by filled squares ( note that chronologically , the far - red spectra were obtained earlier , so brown dwarf status was already confirmed for some sources when the near - infrared candidates were selected and observed ) .",
    "also , many of the candidate brown dwarfs selected for near - infrared spectroscopy were chosen because they exhibit @xmath52 .",
    "this criterion limits overlap with the optically visible sample and reduces contamination from foreground stars .",
    "additionally , the sources with high s / n @xmath34band magnitudes were placed on a near - infrared color - color diagram as seen in figure [ fig : nir_cc ] to reject sources with colors similar to those of giants ( * ? ? ?",
    "* red dotted line in figure [ fig : nir_cc ] ) .",
    "spectra were obtained for a total of 88 brown dwarf candidates identified in omc 2/3 .",
    "this includes 32 candidates obtained with the mmt and keck telescopes in the far - red spectral regions , and 56 highly extinguished candidates observed in the near - infrared regime with the infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) .",
    "far - red ( 0.6@xmath01.0 @xmath5 m ) spectral observations were obtained for a total of 32 brown dwarf candidates in omc 2/3 on four different occasions .",
    "spectra of seven brown dwarf candidates were obtained 2002 november 5 with the low resolution imaging spectrograph @xcite on the 10-meter keck i telescope from about 6400 to 7700   using the 1200 lines / mm grating ; spectra were obtained with about a 2   resolution .",
    "spectra of twelve brown dwarf candidates were obtained on 2002 november 11 and 2002 december 15 using the blue channel spectrograph on the mmt observatory 6.5-meter telescope , centered at 7600   using the 600 lines / mm grating .",
    "lastly , spectra of thirteen brown dwarf candidates were obtained on 2003 january 26@xmath027 with the red channel spectrograph at the mmt , also centered at 7600   using the 270 lines / mm grating .",
    "in addition to the spectra of the candidates , arc ( henear ) lamp spectra were obtained for wavelength calibration and continuum `` bright '' lamps were observed for flat fielding .",
    "all of the far - red spectra are reduced similarly .",
    "first a bias frame is subtracted from the source frames , then they are flat fielded using the spectra of the bright lamps . finally the source spectrum is extracted and wavelength calibrated using the henear lamp spectrum .        for the highly extinguished omc 2/3 brown dwarf candidates , low resolution , near - infrared spectroscopy",

    "near - infrared spectroscopy is the only reliable means for obtaining an accurate census of the more heavily embedded ( and therefore reddened ) brown dwarfs in omc 2/3 and the wavelength coverage of spex in the single - prism mode ( 0.8@xmath02.5 @xmath5 m ) combined with the high , dry site of mauna kea is ideal for accurately measuring water absorption in young brown dwarfs .",

    "although stars with ew[h@xmath4 ] @xmath39 @xmath040    may still be accreting , we can not distinguish between accretion and chromospheric activity without resolving the h@xmath4 line and measuring its velocity width .",

    "these steam absorption bands characterize late m dwarfs by broad , plateau - like features in the spectrum @xcite . however , young stars and brown dwarfs look quite different in that they exhibit sharp , triangular shaped peaks in the @xmath35 and @xmath12bands @xcite .",
    "the sharp peaks in the @xmath35band are possibly due to a reduction in h@xmath9 collision induced absorption @xcite .",

    "figure [ fig : spectypes ] displays a representative sample of the grid of pre - main sequence star and young brown dwarf standards used to classify the candidate brown dwarfs in omc 2/3 . the grid of standards was compiled from taurus and ic 348 spectra obtained with spex as part of this study ( see section [ sec : spexspectra ] ) as well as those obtained by @xcite and @xcite . each candidate spectrum was compared to each spectrum in the grid of standards , reddened using the following interstellar extinction law from @xcite :    @xmath60    a custom idl routine computed the value of chi - square for each template reddened by a range of extinction values and selected the one that minimized chi - square as the best fit .",

    "the best fit spectral type from the near - infrared spectrum is m8.5 with an a@xmath62 = 0.5 . because of these triangular shaped features , it is relatively easy to distinguish between young members and foreground dwarfs or background giants that may contaminate the candidate sample . by varying the spectral type of the standard being used for the fit ( as shown in figure [ fig : bd29illus ] ) , we estimate an uncertainty in spectral class of @xmath55 0.5 subclass .",
    "in addition to candidate 29 , several other low mass members , specifically candidates 30 , 5 and 75 , were observed in the far - red and with spex .",
    "for candidate 30 , the best fit near - infrared type is m7.25 and the far - red type , m7 .",
    "candidate 5 has a near - infrared type of m4.75 and a far - red type of m4.75 ; both spectra indicate that this is a low mass member of omc 2/3 .",
    "candidate 75 has a best fit near - infrared type of m5.75@xmath0m6 and the far - red type is m6 .",
    "in general , near - infrared spectral types of candidates with existing far - red spectra give spectral types within 0.5 subclass of the far - red spectral type .",
    "the spectra for candidate 30 is shown ( as a spectral template for sources 1004_979 and 845_236 ) in figure [ fig : irspectra ] and candidates 5 and 75 are shown in figure [ fig : irspectra2 ] .",

    "spectral classification for the cormass spectra used the same method as for the spex spectra , though the regions of the spectra dominated by absorption from telluric water vapor were noisier in the cormass spectra and so were removed during the classification process .",
    "figure [ fig : cormassspectra ] shows five of the six near - infrared spectra obtained with cormass ; in two of the cases the spectra obtained were for sources already classified from far - red spectra .",
    "candidate 31 , which we found to have a far - red spectral type of m7.75 , has a near - infrared spectral type from cormass data of m7.5 .",
    "for the other source , candidate 21 , the cormass and far - red spectral types are also within 0.25 subclasses .    to demonstrate that the cormass spectra can be classified using the spex standard spectra , we compared candidates 21 and 30 , both of which have far - red spectral types of m7 .",
    "candidate 21 was observed with cormass and candidate 30 was observed with spex .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : cormassspectra ] , these spectra have virtually identical shapes : candidate 30 looks like candidate 21 , reddened with an a@xmath62=4 . therefore we maintain that the spex spectra and cormass spectra are comparable , within 0.25 subclasses .",
    "it is useful to note that this was also seen in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the remaining spectra obtained with cormass that did not overlap with previous far - red or spex observations are also illustrated in figure [ fig : cormassspectra ] .",
    "the source d216 - 0939 was imaged by @xcite with advanced camera for surveys on the hubble space telescope as a nearly edge - on disk .",
    "its near - infrared spectrum , shown in figure [ fig : cormassspectra ] , is shown with a young m3 star over - plotted .",
    "it is clear that the spectral type of this source is earlier than m3 .",
    "however , since we do not have template near - infrared spectra for young stars with spectral types earlier than m3 , we were unable to precisely determine the type .",
    "in addition , when we compared d216 - 0939 with field dwarfs earlier than m3 , it was difficult to match the shape of these sources with the shape of d216 - 0939 because of a near - infrared excess which we attribute to the disk . therefore , this object is classified as having an indeterminate type and is listed in table [ table : fieldspectra ] .",
    "the cormass spectrum of chs 9695 indicates that it is a highly reddened object ( see figure [ fig : cormassspectra ] ) .",
    "although the spectrum very closely matches a spectrum of a young m3 object , it is slightly shallower and therefore , as with d216 - 0939 , we were also unable to precisely determine its type ( see table [ table : fieldspectra ] ) .",
    "the candidate chs 8782 was successfully classified from its cormass spectrum through our comparison method as a member of omc 2/3 with a spectral type of m5.25 .",
    "one additional candidate , 583_352 has a cormass spectrum with very low signal - to - noise and therefore we are unable to confidently determine a spectral type .",
    "spectra have been obtained for 88 candidate low mass members in omc 2/3 , of which 40 new low mass members with spectral types of m4@xmath0m9 have been identified . of those , 19 have spectral types later than m6.5 , making them _ bona fide _ young brown dwarfs . as seen in figure [ fig : image_dist ] , the spatial distribution of the young brown dwarfs as compared with the low mass m4@xmath0m6 sources is fairly similar .",
    "we have observed all the brown dwarf candidates that fall below 0.080 @xmath3 and above 0.050 @xmath3 ( for 1  myr objects ) , and with an extinction limit of @xmath63 , making a complete sample within this regime ( see figure [ fig : irtfpropfigs2003 ] ) . within these parameters",
    "lie a total of 22 candidates and of those , 11 are spectroscopically confirmed members with spectral types of m4@xmath0m9 , and 11 are objects of indeterminate type ( one of which , 583_352 , might be a member but a higher signal - to - noise spectrum is necessary for confirmation ) . therefore we find that @xmath4050% of candidates detected within this range of extinction and dereddened magnitude are members .      in order to determine the masses and ages of our sample , we estimate the effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities for the 40 low mass members and place them on an h - r diagram .",
    "the effective temperature , t@xmath64 , for each source was determined from its spectral type using the temperature scale of @xcite .",
    "we used the  color to determine the reddening and dereddened the @xmath35band magnitude ; then the bolometric correction was applied .",
    "the methodology is described in detail in appendix [ sec : lbol_teff ] .",
    "it is important to note that the a@xmath62 values used to compute the dereddened @xmath35band magnitude are not based on the ones found from spectral classification , but are based on the  color .",
    "the reason for this is that the standard spectra used for comparison are the _ observed spectra _ and have not been dereddened . although the a@xmath62 values for these sources are low ( likely a@xmath65 2 ) , we wanted to deredden all the spectra uniformly and therefore chose to do so using the  color .",
    "figure [ fig : hrdiagram ] shows the resulting effective temperatures and bolometric luminosities for the omc 2/3 members on an h - r diagram ( note that only 39 of the 40 low mass members appear on the diagram because source 774_120 does not have a @xmath34band magnitude and so its bolometric luminosity could not be calculated in the same way as the others ) .",
    "over - plotted are the 1 , 3 , and 10  myr isochrones from @xcite .",
    "these isochrones are appropriate since we have adopted the temperature scale of @xcite which has been calibrated for use with these isochrones .",
    "based on these evolutionary tracks , we estimate the 40 members with m4@xmath0m9 spectral types to range in mass from 0.35@xmath00.015 @xmath3 . in general , though , the evolutionary models at present do not extrapolate consistent masses for sources with masses below the hydrogen burning limit @xcite . an additional uncertainty in the h - r diagram of omc 2/3",
    "lies in the adopted distance of 450 pc . using the more recent value of 420 pc ( e.g.",
    "* ) instead of 450 pc shifts the points down on the h - r diagram , to later ages , by a value of @xmath66 ( l@xmath6/l@xmath67 ) @xmath40 0.06 .",
    "seventeen of the nineteen sources with spectral types later than m6.5 are located above the 1  myr track .",
    "however , two of them ( candidates 21 and 845_236 ) sit well below the 3  myr track .",
    "for the 21 members with spectral types between m4 and m6 , 11 of them fall either very close to the 1  myr isochrone or between the 1 and 3  myr isochrones , and there are 8 likely members that fall very close to , or below the 3  myr isochrone . although there are several sources that appear clustered at an age below the 3  myr isochrone on the h - r diagram , this is primarily due to a selection effect from our requirement that the luminosity of our candidates be less than that of a 1  myr brown dwarf . without spectral types for the more luminous sources in omc 2/3 , we can not determine whether these ages are typical , or whether most of the stars are indeed above 1  myr in age .",
    "we have detected one m4 source above the 1  myr isochrone ; this source serendipitously fell into the slit during our observations and was not in the sample selected from our photometry .",
    "also shown in figure [ fig : hrdiagram ] are the cormass sources chs 9695 , a source which is variable ( and hence a likely member ) , as seen by @xcite , and d216 - 0939 , the edge - on disk discovered by @xcite .",
    "since we have assigned an upper limit of m3 for the spectral types for these two objects ( see table [ table : fieldspectra ] ) , the locations of these sources on the h - r diagram are plotted for spectral classifications of m1 , m2 and m3 .",
    "chs 9695 is clearly young , falling well above the 1  myr track for all three spectral types .",
    "the edge - on disk , d216 - 0939 , falls between the 3  myr and 10  myr tracks for all three spectral types .",
    "we caution that the possibility of strong veiling for d216 - 0939 in the 1@xmath01.8 @xmath5 m regime could result in a significant overestimation in the temperature of this object .",
    "the fact that d216 - 0939 , as well as candidates 21 and 845_236 mentioned above , appear older than 3  myr on the h - r diagram suggests that it is possible these sources are underluminous and young but appear older on the h - r diagram due to an obscuring disk .",
    "disks may absorb the light of the star , particularly if they are highly flared @xcite ; however , the star may not appear unusually red due to a strong contribution of light scattered off the disk .",
    "hubble space telescope images of d216 - 0939 show a strong contribution from scattered light in this system @xcite . in support of this ,",
    "candidate 21 shows strong h@xmath4 emission , suggesting that it has an accretion disk .    to obtain a more accurate estimate of the age of omc 2/3 , we need spectra of candidate members with types earlier than m6 and with luminosities above our luminosity limit to fill in that portion of the h - r diagram . with the h - r diagram we currently have",
    ", we can make the following observations .",
    "first , eighteen of the forty omc 2/3 sources ( 45% ) , and in particular , seventeen of the nineteen ( 89% ) young brown dwarfs , are located above the 1  myr isochrone",
    ". therefore we estimate an age for omc 2/3 of approximately 1  myr .",
    "second , although many of the members are close to or above the 1  myr isochrone , we clearly detect a range of ages along the line - of - sight to omc 2/3 .",
    "we now examine the implications of this observed age spread .",
    "the wide range of inferred ages detected in omc 2/3 is surprising given the high density of protostars , and hence the presumed youth , of this region .",
    "there has already been considerable debate on the nature of age spreads in the orion molecular cloud .",
    "@xcite find evidence for an age spread of 8@xmath010  myr in the h - r diagram of stars in the onc , which they argue is real .",
    "@xcite find evidence of an increasing ( i.e. accelerating ) rate of star formation in the onc which continued to rise until the present time . in their age histogram for stars in the onc",
    "( with masses ranging from 0.4@xmath00.6 @xmath3 ) , all stars are less than 10  myr in age , with most having ages less than 7  myr .",
    "@xcite , and more recently @xcite , argue that such age spreads may result from uncertainties in the luminosity , membership , and the pre - main sequence star tracks .",
    "in addition , @xcite discuss how the presence of multiple systems can result in an age spread in their study of the upper sco association .",
    "multiplicity would result in an _ underestimate _ of the ages .",
    "this likely effects only a very small percentage of sources in omc 2/3 since the companion star fraction in the outskirts of the onc for low mass pms sources ( @xmath685% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been found to be much lower than in other star - forming regions ( a factor of 5 lower than in upper sco ) .    in a study of low mass stars and brown dwarfs in the onc , @xcite see two populations toward the onc : a young , @xmath68 1  myr population and an older , 10  myr population .",
    "however , in a more recent study of 45 new members of the trapezium , an older , 10  myr population of stars was not seen @xcite ; they suggest this may be the result of their source selection .",
    "although we do not see a clear bifurcation into two populations as in @xcite , our h - r diagram for the neighboring omc 2/3 region shows a significant age spread as well .",
    "understanding the age spread in omc 2/3 can bring new insight into the debate over the age spreads observed in orion as a whole .",
    "it is important to note that we rule out that the age spread seen is due to an error in spectral classification .",
    "all candidates determined to be members in omc 2/3 show low surface gravity features in their spectra that rule out the possibility that they are foreground m dwarfs .",
    "in addition , the photometric uncertainty is small and any variability is likely on the order of tenths of magnitudes , not several magnitudes as would be required to change the h - r diagram significantly .",
    "one possible source of uncertainty lies in our method of using a constant intrinsic  color to calculate the color excess for each source ( see appendix [ sec : lbol_teff ] ) ; however , to test this , we plotted the same h - r diagram using the intrinsic  values for each spectral type presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* using the young disk population types found in their table 6 ) . using the values presented in that table instead of a constant intrinsic  color for all spectral types shifts the location of the sources with spectral types of m7.5 and later slightly closer to the 1  myr isochrone , but does not shift them to ages older than 1  myr .",
    "we consider here several reasons for the spread of ages seen in omc 2/3 : confusion with members of the older subgroups in the orion ob  1 association , uncertainties in the determination of luminosity and spectral type due to extinction from a disk , veiling , and finally , the presence of a _ bona fide _ age spread .",
    "first , we assess the possibility of contamination from older members of the ob  1 association by examining the number of sources in each age range versus the amount of extinction toward that object ( see figure [ fig : avhisto ] ) .",
    "all 40 low mass members with spectral types ranging from m4@xmath0m9 are included , as well as the two cormass sources with upper limits to their spectral types of m3 .",
    "the sources are grouped into three categories : those with ages on the h - r diagram @xmath8 1  myr , those with ages 1@xmath03  myr , and those with ages @xmath39 3  myr .",
    "the low extinction values for the 1@xmath03  myr sources may indicate we are seeing a foreground population ; or perhaps we are seeing the older , orion ob 1c association which is 4.6  myr old @xcite and falls along the line - of - sight of omc 2/3",
    ". however , it seems unlikely that the sources greater than 3  myr are foreground since they are , for the most part , more embedded .",
    "we can not completely rule out this scenario because some of the older stars may show extinction due to circumstellar dust or from dust located within the orion ob association but outside the molecular cloud .",
    "furthermore , some older stars could be trapped within the orion molecular cloud , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "second , as discussed before , a combination of extinction and scattering from a nearly edge - on , flared circumstellar disk could result in the luminosity of a star being underestimated . since this would depend on the presence of a disk , as well as its inclination",
    ", the effect of disks could result in both increased scatter and an overestimated age .",
    "the @xmath39 3  myr sources d216 - 0939 , candidate 21 , and candidate 845_236 are possible examples of sources which appear underluminous due to the presence of a disk ; these examples make this perhaps the most likely of these scenarios . as additional support for this scenario ,",
    "at least three of the @xmath4010  myr sources in the onc are known proplyds or silhouette disks , and therefore younger than their positions on the h - r diagram suggest @xcite .",
    "third , excess emission from nonphotospheric sources in the @xmath34 and @xmath35bands may effect our estimates of both luminosity and effective temperature .",
    "@xcite find that for classical t tauri stars , @xmath34 and @xmath35band luminosities are consistently overestimated , leading to an underestimation in age .",
    "if we are to assume that there is significant @xmath34 and @xmath35band excess in our omc 2/3 sources which we have not accounted for , then this would imply that we have overestimated the photospheric luminosity of the sources and that the ages are systematically underestimated .",
    "this could increase the observed age spread by shifting sources with higher accretion rates to younger inferred ages ; however , this would also imply that many sources are older than they appear on the h - r diagram . in this case the mass , particularly of the brown dwarfs , would stay relatively constant since the mass tracks are virtually vertical at these ages ( see figure [ fig : hrdiagram ] ) .",
    "near - infrared excess could also cause veiling and potentially bias sources to earlier types by reducing the observed depth of the water features .",
    "although we find some evidence for @xmath12band excesses in the color - color diagram , we find no evidence for excesses in the spectra given the excellent fits in the near - infrared spectra and the consistency between the far - red and near - infrared spectral types .",
    "therefore , there is no clear evidence for veiling and significant excess emission in the @xmath34 and @xmath35bands .",
    "finally , it is possible that the age spread we see in omc 2/3 is real .",
    "this is the conclusion drawn by @xcite based on their study of lithium depletion in the onc .",
    "they find low mass members of the onc with ages @xmath69 10  myr , which is much older than many of the stars in this region , and indicate that this may mean the star formation history of the cluster has a much longer duration than previously thought .",
    "@xcite used rotation periods and equatorial velocities of known pms stars in the onc to model the distribution of their projected radii and in turn , the distribution of ages .",
    "the simulations showed that an age spread of 1@xmath03 myr in the low - luminosity onc members is consistent with the data , independent of the evolutionary models used .",
    "however , the older stars discovered in the conventional h - r diagram analysis were not present in his analysis .",
    "jeffries concluded that he could not verify the presence of the 10  myr sources .    in order to determine which of these possibilities is most likely in omc 2/3",
    ", future studies should examine the ages of the stars above the hydrogen burning limit to see if most stars in omc 2/3 have ages around 1  myr , similar to the brown dwarfs , or if an age spread is seen in the higher mass pms stars as well .",
    "with such a complete sample , we could potentially fully understand the star formation history of omc 2/3 .",
    "forty new low mass members with spectral types of m4@xmath0m9 have been spectroscopically confirmed in omc 2/3 .",
    "using deep , photometry of a 20@xmath1 @xmath2 20@xmath1 field in omc 2/3 , we selected candidates with luminosities and colors consistent with brown dwarfs for follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "low resolution , far - red and near - infrared spectra were obtained for a sample of candidates and 19 objects with spectral types of m6.5@xmath0m9 and 21 objects with spectral types of m4@xmath0m6 were confirmed by fitting these spectra to standard spectra , and presented .",
    "these spectral types correspond to masses of 0.35@xmath00.015 @xmath3 using the evolutionary models of @xcite and we estimate an age for omc 2/3 from the substellar members of approximately 1  myr .",
    "however , a significant fraction of selected low luminosity sources are pre - main sequence stars with ages ranging from 1@xmath010  myr .",
    "we discussed several reasons for the age spread we see in omc 2/3 .",
    "first , that the older stars are part of the ob  1c association in the foreground to the orion a cloud .",
    "although this possibility has not been ruled out , we find it unlikely because the older stars seem to be embedded in the orion molecular cloud , as was found for the older stars in the onc @xcite .",
