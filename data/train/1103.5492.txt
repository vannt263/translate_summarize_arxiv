    "@xcite introduced the redshift dependent function @xmath10 which for spatially flat frw cosmologies ( @xmath11 ) reduces to @xmath12 .",
    "it has the interesting feature that for the @xmath13cdm model ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , it yields @xmath16 , whereas for quintessence fields ( @xmath17 ) and phantom fields ( @xmath18 ) it gives @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "since this diagnostic does not depend on the present values of the density parameters , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , it circumvents the drawbacks brought about by our comparatively poor knowledge of them .",
    "in fact , it is expected to be useful when accurate data of @xmath23 at different redshifts become available .",
    "this seems more feasible than to substantially upgrade our knowledge of @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the near future .    at present",
    ", the @xmath13cdm model fits the observational data , within statistical errors , rather well -see , e.g. @xcite . nonetheless if future data come to reveal that @xmath24 , a number of de alternatives should be considered including scenarios in which the de interacts non - gravitationally with other components .    here",
    ", we assume that de and cdm , subscript @xmath25 , interact with each other ( whence they do not evolve separately ) but not with baryonic matter , subscript @xmath26 , since interactions with baryons are strongly constrained by experiments @xcite .",
    "this possibility is being actively considered in the literature -see @xcite and references therein- since it is rather natural @xcite and more general than otherwise , it substantially alleviates the coincidence problem ( i.e. ,  why are the densities of matter and dark energy of the same order precisely today \" ) , and agrees with observation .    in this paper",
    "we propose several criteria , based on the evolution of the hubble factor , to help discriminate models in which de and cdm interact with each other non - gravitationally from models in which they do not , and to tell quintessence de energy models from phantom models .",
    "clearly , for these criteria to be useful accurate data of @xmath27 are needed .",
    "while the present data exhibit large error bars @xcite the situation may well improve comparatively soon thanks to upcoming and planned experiments . the baryon oscillation spectroscopy survey ( boss ) 5-years project @xcite aims at measuring the absolute cosmic distance scale and expansion rate with percent - level precision at redshifts @xmath28 and @xmath29 using the standard rule furnished by the baryon acoustic oscillations . the forecast precision for @xmath27 at @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 is @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "data at intermediate and larger redshifts will partly come by adapting to @xmath36 the method proposed by hogan @xcite which makes use of the gravitational radiation emitted by black hole binary inspiral events to determine @xmath37 with a precision better than @xmath38 .",
    "the method may be extended up to @xmath39 redshifts , and even to @xmath40 by observing massive black hole binaries since there will likely be a direct electromagnetic counterpart of the merger @xcite .",
    "an even more promising method , proposed by corasaniti",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite to constrain cosmological parameters , exploits the sandage - loeb test @xcite .",
    "it consists in measuring the redshift of distant objects at two separate times , say @xmath41 and @xmath42 , at the present epoch .",
    "the redshift variation of the source ( subscript @xmath43 ) between these two instants is , at a very good precision , @xmath44 -see eq . ( 5 ) in @xcite .",
    "this expression , re - written as @xmath45 , provides us with the value of the hubble factor at the time the source emitted the electromagnetic signal that is currently arriving at our detectors ( either telescopes or radio - telescopes ) , modulo we know @xmath37 accurately enough .",
    "the authors of @xcite suggested using the absorption lines of the lyman-@xmath46 forest in the redshift interval @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "altogether , encouraged by the prospects of a greatly improved knowledge of the history of @xmath27 we present several criteria that may help telling apart interacting from noninteracting dark energy models .",
    "section ii presents on phenomenological basis some possible expressions of the interaction term .",
    "sections iii and iv introduce various criteria to distinguish interacting from noninteracting de models .",
    "section v focus on the statefinder parameters and compares their usefulness with the criteria based on the hubble history .",
    "finally , section vi summarizes our findings .",
    "since the dark components are assumed to interact with one another also non - gravitationally but not with baryons the conservation equations take the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the interaction term and the relationship @xmath51 is understood .",
    "it is worth noticing that when @xmath52 -as we shall consider throughout- the coincidence problem is alleviated since @xmath53 decreases more slowly with expansion and @xmath54 more quickly , and the problem may even be solved in full @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath50 were negative , the second law of thermodynamics could be violated @xcite , and the energy densities of cdm or de could become negative at high or low redshifts .    in the absence of a fundamental theory for dark energy the quantity @xmath50 can not be derived from first principles .",
    "however , we may guess likely expressions for it by noting that @xmath50 must be small @xcite ( at least lower than @xmath55 ) and depend on the energy densities multiplied by a quantity with units of inverse of time , a rate .",
    "we shall deal with two different possibilities considered in the literature , namely , @xmath56 that the said rate is proportional to the hubble factor , and @xmath57 that it is just a constant @xcite .    in case @xmath56 , we have that @xmath58 . by power law expanding this function and retaining just the first term one follows @xmath59 .",
    "given the lack of information about the coupling , it appears advisable to work with just one parameter rather than two .",
    "thus , three different choices arise , namely , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 . it is worth mentioning that expressions of this type can be obtained from the scalar - tensor theory of gravity developed by kaloper _",
    "@xcite -see e.g. @xcite . in the next section",
    "we shall consider successively three expressions for @xmath50 with @xmath63 , while keeping @xmath64 constant throughout , and look for diagnostics -based in the history of @xmath27 that may tell interacting from noninteracting models .    in case",
    "@xmath57 we have @xmath65 and proceeding as before we write @xmath66 where the @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) quantities denote constant rates .",
    "this expression was inspired in reheating models @xcite , curvaton decay @xcite , and decay of dm into radiation @xcite . regrettably",
    ", one of the energy densities ( @xmath69 or @xmath54 ) becomes negative either at early or late times @xcite and , generally , it does not solve the coincidence problem .",
    "nevertheless , we will briefly consider it in the section after next .",
    "we begin by assuming that the interaction term takes the form @xmath71 where the factor @xmath72 was introduced for mathematical convenience .      one way to explain the present small value of the cosmological constant is to assume a transfer of energy from the quantum vacuum to particles and/or radiation -i.e .",
    ", a decaying cosmological constant ( dcc ) . along the years",
    "a diversity of phenomenological models have been proposed , many of which are summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite . if the quantum vacuum ( @xmath15 ) slowly decays into non - baryonic cdm particles , integration of eqs .",
    "( [ conserv1a])-([conserv1c ] ) yields @xmath73    this kind of models are not purely phenomenological any more for they have received some persuasive backings from the theoretical side @xcite , which makes their consideration all the more interesting . in particular , by means of the renormalization group theory the authors of @xcite arrive to a simple expression for @xmath74 ( @xmath75 in their notation ) in terms of the masses of the super - heavy sub - planckian particles -see their eq .",
    "a rather similar expression was found by removing the flat space - time contribution to the vacuum energy of quantum fields in homogeneous and isotropic universes by employing a technique similar to that used in the computation of the arnowitt - deser - misner mass -see eq .",
    "( 39 ) in ref .",
    ". moreover , consistency both with primordial nucleosynthesis and large scale structure formation leads to the constraint @xmath76 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , dcc models were revisited by basilakos _",
    "_ @xcite and , for some specific choices of @xmath77 , confronted with observational data from supernovae type ia , baryon acoustic oscillations , the cosmic microwave background shift parameter , and the growth rate of galaxy clustering .",

    ". obviously , in this case @xmath83 with @xmath84 , but rather @xmath85 thus , the @xmath86 criterion would mistake a dcc model by a quintessence field ( phantom field ) if applied at low redshifts ( high redshifts ) .",
    "similar situations occur if the said criterion is used on models considered below in this paper .",
    "the first and second derivatives of @xmath87 with respect to @xmath88 are @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "therefore , for large redshifts the first derivative tends to @xmath91 from above .",
    "likewise , @xmath87 is concave ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) .",
    "by contrast , for noninteracting dark energy fields with @xmath64 constant -see eq .",
    "( [ friedmann1])- one has , @xmath93 . for large redshifts",
    "this expression tends to @xmath21 from above if de is of quintessence type and from below if it is phantom . in view that , observationally ,",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath21 are separated by a non small gap ( the latter might be about six or seven times larger than the former ) this may serve discriminate dcc models from noninteracting quintessence and phantom models .",
    "one may think that we would have arrived to the same result just just by dividing @xmath87 by @xmath88 ; i.e. , @xmath94 .",
    "however , this is not true because of the factor @xmath95 in the second term of the derivative which makes the latter tend to @xmath21 faster , and it is key to tell whether the de is quintessence s or phantom s type .    as a corollary",
    ", we may say that the sign of the second derivative , may discriminate dcc from noninteracting phantom models , the former being negative and the latter positive , @xmath96 ; only that this criterion can be used also at smaller redshift than the preceding one .",
    "likewise , by measuring @xmath27 at two separated redshifts , @xmath97 and @xmath98 with @xmath99 , they may be discriminated . indeed , for noninteracting phantom models the quantity",

    "( [ evlambda ] ) will prove very useful , given the comparatively wide uncertainty in the value of @xmath103 .",
    "however , the following strategy may work .",
    "consider two competing dcc models ( say a and b ) and recall that @xmath91 is reasonably well determined from primordial nucleosynthesis ( @xmath104 , see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) together with the present value of the hubble factor .",

    "this will enable us to determine which dcc model , a or b , fits better the @xmath27 data .",
    "it should be noted that , in this regard , it looks more advantageous to use this other ratio @xmath108 since it can constrain @xmath74 more easily .    at any rate , aside from this specific instance , the @xmath86 function ( eq .

    "the usefulness of the said pair stems from the fact that different models are characterized by different graphs in the @xmath196 plane ; in particular , the @xmath13cdm model is associated to the single point @xmath197 .",
    "so , they may help elucidate the right de candidate .",
    "when these parameters are calculated for cosmological models in which de and dm interact with each other it is seen that the interaction first appears in the third derivative of the scale factor @xcite . in particular , for @xmath198 one has @xmath199 more specifically if one wished to resort to the present value of @xmath191 to discriminate the @xmath13cdm model from the dcc model ( @xmath200 , @xmath201 ) of sub - section iii.a , one would find @xmath202 .",
    "if , instead , the interaction is governed by eq .",
    "( [ qroy1 ] ) one obtains @xmath203 this suggests that once the @xmath144 parameters come to be accurately determined at different redshifts , the statefinder parameters will not only tell whether the interaction really exists but also will help discern the expression for @xmath50 .",
    "however , for the time being , the wide uncertainties about these seriously restrict the utility of the @xmath204 pair in this respect .    altogether ,",
    "the diagnostics founded on the @xmath109 and @xmath205 functions appear more advantageous since the interaction parameters ( i.e. , the @xmath74 and @xmath67 quantities ) , enter the hubble factor upon integration ( analytical or numerical ) of the conservation equations ( [ conserv1a])-([conserv1c ] ) .",
    "interacting models of dark energy are well motivated , substantially alleviate the coincidence problem , and show compatibility with observation . thus the question arises ,  can they be discriminated from noninteracting models ? \" for the time being , the answer is not given our still imperfect knowledge of basic cosmological parameters , such as the hubble factor .",
    "the latter is key in constraining models with observational data from baryon acoustic oscillations , the r - shift parameter of cosmic background radiation , the matter growth parameter , etc .",
    "nevertheless , the situation is to improve greatly in the not far future thanks to a variety of upcoming and planed experiments .    to extract the invaluable information about the nature of dark energy encrypted in the history of the hubble factor",
    "is does not suffice to have abundant , accurate data of @xmath27 .",
    "one must first set up simple and practical criteria to be used once these data become available .",
    "we proposed several criteria , of notable mathematical simplicity , based on an accurate knowledge of the said history -something we reasonably hope to have at our disposal not very soon but , at least , in the foreseeable future .",
    "specifically if @xmath206 results positive ( negative ) , then the dark energy is of phantom type ( either quintessence or a decaying cosmological constant ) .",
    "only if the de is not - decaying cosmological constant , the graph of @xmath109 vs. @xmath88 will yield a straight line .    to discern whether de is interacting ( with @xmath207 ) or not the behavior of @xmath208 at high redshifts must be studied .",
    "if this derivative tends to the present value of the fractional baryon density , @xmath91 , then there will be grounds to believe that is it interacting with the interaction term @xmath50 given either by eq .",
    "( [ q1 ] ) or ( [ q13 ] ) .",
    "if it tends to @xmath21 , then we may strongly suspect that it is not interacting ; and , in particular , if it coincides with @xmath21 independently of redshift , then it will most likely be a conserved cosmological constant -see eq .",
    "( [ friedmann1 ] ) .",
    "finally , if the redshift function @xmath120 does not tend to any of these two quantities , we may conclude that either de is interacting with @xmath50 given by eq .",
    "( [ q12 ] ) or some other law not considered here , or that in reality @xmath121 is not a constant but a function of redshift .",
    "obviously , this would complicate matters very much because it would call for the introduction of further parameters in the analysis -something that we defer to a future work .",
    "if the plot of @xmath170 vs. @xmath88 exhibits a very steep slope at redshifts much smaller than unity , we may conclude that the interaction obeys eq .",
    "( [ qroy1 ] ) ( with @xmath209 and @xmath210 non - negative ) .",
    "its absence excludes such interaction , but it is very hard to specify whether the slope is steep enough . on the other hand , since this criterion deals with the slope of the second derivative extremely accurate data of @xmath181 at these redshifts must be employed .",
    "the statefinder parameters @xcite will be very useful to rule out cosmological models , and tell apart different interacting models , but first the histories of @xmath211 and @xmath212 must be accurately established in a model - independent manner .",
    "this looks more challenging than obtaining an accurate history of the hubble factor .",
    "since the interaction alters the abundance of dark matter in the past two additional ways to ascertain if the de is interacting or not can be implemented , namely , to examine the behavior of the growth factor , and to study the weak lensing power spectrum . if -as we assumed throughout- the de decays into dark matter , then it must have been less dark matter in the past than in the corresponding noninteracting model with the same @xmath121 and , consequently , the growth factor must be smaller . on the other hand , this would imply a decline of the lensing spectrum ( the opposite would hold true if dm decayed into de ) .",
    "both effects have been considered by the authors of ref .",
    "however , they do not take @xmath121 constant but assume the chevalier - polarski - linder ansatz @xcite with very specific values for the parameters entering that expression .",
    "this is why comparison with our work does not seem straightforward . at any rate , both studies may be seen as complementary .    while the criteria introduced in this paper should be helpful in deciphering the nature of de they should be used alongside the analysis and interpretation of data coming from a variety of sources : supernovae type ia , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) , matter power spectrum , baryon acoustic oscillations , weak lensing , and evolution of galaxy clusters .",
    "the latter lies at the core of recent studies about the dynamical equilibrium of the clusters which seem to favor a decay of de into dm over other possible scenarios @xcite .",
    "in particular , a promising way to test the existence of the interaction is to consider its impact on the integrated sachs - wolfe effect .",
    "since the former alters the evolution rate of gravitational potentials it must affect the frequency shift experienced by cmbr photons crossing collapsing structures .",
    "again , studies of this kind hint at the existence of the interaction with de decaying into dm @xcite .",
    "we restricted ourselves to constant @xmath121 and vanishing spatial curvature . while this automatically limits the scope of our work we feel it does not do it seriously , at least no more than otherwise since it would introduce additional unknown parameters that would compromise the said scope in other ways .",
