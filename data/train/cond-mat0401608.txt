    "the nos - hoover model , @xcite,@xcite , is widely used in molecular dynamics for simulating a system s behavior at constant temperature . the central idea of the model , that is the introduction ancila dynamic variables to control kinetic energy , admits of various implementations . in the most simple and exploited form it amounts to considering a minimal non - linear extension of the original equations for the system .",
    "it should be noted that hamiltonian versions of the model drew considerable attention , @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the nos - hoover model in the form generally employed in molecular dynamics , that is a system constructed from initial hamiltonian equations , i.e. newton s second law , by employing non - linear dissipative terms on their right - hand sides and an additional equation for the dissipation constant,@xmath3 , which is allowed to vary in time , so that the equations of evolution read @xmath4 in this setting the nos - hoover model is a hamiltonian system with dissipation . for small values of @xmath1",
    "the dissipative effects can be treated within the framework of perturbation theory .",
    "considerable criticism has been levelled at the nos - hoover approach , ( see paper @xcite and references therein ) , because it runs across difficulties in providing the correct thermodynamic behavior for simple harmonic systems , but it is still generally accepted that its efficiency improves with the increase of complexity and dimension of the simulated system,@xcite .",
    "in fact , from the point of view of dynamical theory it models a non - linear time - dependent dissipative environment and , therefore , has some proper physical interest .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on ensembles of harmonic oscillators ; the importance of such systems follows from the fact that among these , is the harmonic lattice , familiar in the theories of solids and molecules .",
    "the potential energy of a harmonic lattice is given by the quadratic form @xmath5 in which @xmath6 is the @xmath7-th coordinate of the @xmath8-th particle .",
    "to see the symmetry properties of the model we may cast eq.([n - h1 ] ) in the matrix form @xmath9 in which @xmath10 is the matrix of force constants , @xmath11 .",
    "it can be transformed by an appropriate orthogonal transformation , @xmath12 , to the diagonal form @xmath13 assume that all @xmath14 are equal , @xmath15 , and let @xmath12 be the matrix of the orthogonal transformation mentioned above , and @xmath16 an @xmath17-dimensional vector of coordinates with respect to the new coordinate system determined by @xmath12 . since @xmath18 is constant , and @xmath3 is an invariant of orthogonal transformation , we may cast eq.([n - h1 ] ) in the form @xmath19 so that the equation acquires the form @xmath20 in which the matrix @xmath21 is the diagonal one .",
    "thus , we have transformed the original problem of harmonic lattice to that for a set of harmonic oscillators , which do not interact with each other .",
    "the latter problem is more tractable , from analytical point of view .    at this point",
    "it is worthwhile to notice that problems of molecular dynamics involves dynamical systems of extremely high dimension , and this circumstance brings about specific difficulties for numerical simulation .",
    "the best approach to the problem is to use analytical methods in conjunction with the numerical ones , especially in cases like the nos - hoover model , where systematic investigation of high dimensional problems is particularly interesting , ( see @xcite ) . for this end",
    "we use the method of windows worked out for the needs of the relaxation dynamics of spin in superfluid @xmath22 , ( see the review article @xcite ) to obtain a general picture of the nos - hoover dynamics for an ensemble of harmonic oscillators .",
    "we show that it is characterized by the presence of oscillations round the stationary solution corresponding to an equilibrium , for which the phase - space sampling is different from the normal law .",
    "the numerical analysis of the nos - hoover model given by eqs.([n - h1 ] ) , which is a high - dimensional non - linear dissipative system , is a serious challenge , and , in fact , it is generally confined to low dimensional situations,(see paper @xcite , in which the case of two oscillators is considered ) . in treating high - dimensional problems",
    "the key point is the wise choice of output variables . in the present case",
    "it is dictated by the physics of the problem , and taking into account the structure of the nos - hoover model , that is its being a hamiltonian system with dissipation , we employ , to the effect , the total energy of the system @xmath23 , @xmath24 and the dissipative variable @xmath3 . directing the output in plane @xmath25 , we obtain a kind of two - dimensional window on the phase - space of the model , which has dimension @xmath26",
    ", @xmath17 is the number of oscillators .",
    "since we aim at studying the situations in which @xmath17 is large , the two - dimensional reduction is of primary importance .",
    "next , one should look for the distribution law for the the system in phase - space , and one could expect that it should be either the microcanonical or the gibbs one ; the first is characterized by its being centered on a particular value of energy , @xmath27 , whereas the latter by its being of the characteristic bell - shape .",
    "nothing of the sort happens .",
    "energy regions of the phase - space against visiting time ; the number of oscillators @xmath28 .",
    "dashed line corresponds to eq.([arcsin ] ) provided by the averaged equations .",
    ", width=288,height=192 ]    to find the distribution law we consider the partition of the phase - space in regions @xmath30 corresponding to the energy intervals @xmath31 assumed to be of equal size , and compile a record of periods of time @xmath32 which the system spends in regions ( [ regions ] ) ; the total time of simulation reads @xmath33 the frequencies for the system s visiting the regions are given by the equation @xmath34 it is convenient to use a representation for the set of frequencies by means of histogram , that is rectangles whose widths represent the energy intervals ( [ regions ] ) and whose heights represent corresponding frequencies .",
    "it is worth noting that the partition of the phase - space in the energy regions ( [ regions ] ) can be effected in a more graphic form with the help of the window @xmath25 on the phase space .",
    "in fact , the numerical simulation gives the picture of the system s motion as a thin ring , the times @xmath35 are those spent in the bands @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the frequencies ( [ visiting ] ) could be found with the two - dimensional window , @xmath37 , see fig.([build ] ) .",
    "trajectories visiting regions @xmath38 in ( @xmath23 - @xmath3 ) window .",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath29 . ,",
    "width=288,height=192 ]    recall that we shall consider a set of n _ one - dimensional _ harmonic oscillators .    by following the prescription given above",
    "we obtain the histogram given in fig.([hyst1p ] ) , describing the probability distribution @xmath41 for the system in the phase - space .",
    "it is quite different from the microcanonical one or the gibbs one .",
    "it is important that the window @xmath25 provides a means for elucidating the form of the fluctuations round the stationary state given by the equations @xmath42 the circular motion seen from the window @xmath43 is characterized by a mean angular velocity given by the law @xmath44 to within one - thousandth .",
    "the fact agrees with the histogram given in fig.([hyst1p])(see section [ sec : averaging ] for the details ) . for the case of ideal gas",
    "the oscillation law @xmath45 was found in @xcite ( see eqs.(5 ) and ( 8) of paper @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noted that the shape of the histogram depends on the amplitude of the oscillations , that is the size of deviations in the energy @xmath23 from the stationary value @xmath46 determined by the temperature parameter of the model . in the next section",
    "we shall find the distribution using averaging method , and it is worth noting that the numerical results are in good agreement with those given by the averaging , as is seen from fig.([maxwell1p ] ) . the distribution in energy that should correspond to gibbs canonical ensemble for the set of harmonic oscillators at temperature @xmath47 ,",
    "is given by the equation @xmath48 and is totally different from fig.([hyst1p ] ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the obtained and expected distributions indicate that the nos - hoover model describes a kind of non - linear dissipative system having special properties .",
    "bars , energy distribution , obtained from numerical experiment .",
    "curve , gibbs distribution for the set of harmonic oscillators .",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 . ,",
    "the simulation of the last section , which was thoroughly checked by calculating with different algorithms and comparing their results , might nonetheless be subject to artifacts and errors . in this respect",
    ", it is important that analytical means capable of verifying section [ sec : histogram ] , have been used and resulted in agreement with the numerical work .",
    "let us notice that according to the prescription described in introduction ( see eqs .",
    "( [ n - h1 ] ) ) the ensemble of @xmath17 harmonic oscillators confined to the nos - hoover thermostat is described by the system of equations @xmath49 it is important that the dissipative constant @xmath1 is suggested to be small , @xmath50 , therefore , we may consider , as the first approximation the non dissipative regime for which @xmath51 , @xmath52 . in this case",
    "there is an exact solution given by the equation @xmath53 the energy of the @xmath8-th oscillator devided by mass @xmath2 reads @xmath54 all the masses of the particles assumed equal , @xmath55 , oscillators differing by their frequencies @xmath56 .",
    "equations ( [ xx ] ) , from the topological point of view , mean that the ensemble s motion belongs to an @xmath17-dimensional torus , the whole phase space being foliated by the tori .",
    "we shall consider the system at temperature @xmath47 .",
    "since the parameter @xmath1 is small , we may take into account the nonlinear dissipative terms on the right hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ nos1_1 ] ) , within the framework of the averaging approach , that is by substituting the basic equations ( [ xx ] ) into the right hand sides of the exact equations @xmath57 and cancelling out the oscillating terms .",
    "thus , we obtain the averaged equations @xmath58 or @xmath59 as follows from eq.([energy1 ] ) .    since",
    "the total energy of the system is given by the equation @xmath60 we obtain the following two equations @xmath61 which have the stationary solution : @xmath62 describing the oscillators at the temperature parameter @xmath63 close to the stationary solutions we have the equations for energy @xmath64 in which @xmath65 is small .",
    "therefore the equations for @xmath65 and @xmath3 acquire the form @xmath66 on linearizing the equations indicated above we obtain @xmath67 and hence the equation for @xmath65 @xmath68 which has the form of harmonic oscillator with the frequency @xmath69 solutions to eqs.([nos1_1 ] ) are illustrated in plane ( @xmath23,@xmath3 ) , in fig.([oscil1p ] )     oscillations round the stationary solution , the characteristic frequency @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "dashed line corresponds to the averaged motion of @xmath3 and @xmath23 .",
    ", width=288,height=192 ]    we may use eq.([z ] ) for finding the time spent by the system in the region of the phase - space corresponding to the energy interval , @xmath71 ; it is given by the equation    @xmath72     \\label{arcsin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which leads to the agreement with histogram of fig.([hyst1p ] ) .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of an ensemble of harmonic oscillators confined to the nos - hoover thermostat , the number of the oscillators , @xmath17 , being large , and the dissipative constant , @xmath1 , small .",
    "the numerical simulation , and the analytical averaging method , indicate that the nos - hoover model does not provide for _ thermodynamically meaningful distribution _ of the system s samples in the phase - space , e.g. there is no gibbs distribution .",
    "the @xmath44-frequency law deserves some attention . indeed , if the mass @xmath2 of a particle , corresponding to the oscillator , be @xmath73 , and @xmath74 , the frequency of the oscillations generated by the thermostat dynamics , should be in the region of @xmath75 ghz , that is low frequency region of molecular vibrations .",
    "therefore in applying the nos - hoover thermostat to simulating molecular dynamics in ghz - region , one might expect spurious effects of parametric resonance . at the same time it is worth noting that the nos - hoover model corresponds with a hamiltonian system confined to dissipative environment , that is it comprises a base hamiltonian system , e.g the oscillators , and a dissipative extension formed by ancila variables , in the present case it is the variable @xmath3 . a similar systems , even though more sophisticated ,",
    "is the leggett - takagi theory of spin dynamics in superfluid phases of helium-3 , @xcite , in which the equation describing the spin motion are augmented by an equation for the order parameter , which contains a dissipative term .",
    "the situation is reminiscent of that taking place in the hydrodynamics treatment of viscous phenomena in the ghz - region , where according to the theory worked out by mandelstam and leontovic , see @xcite , the effects of dissipation can be accommodated by employing an ancila dynamical variable @xmath76 , which describes certain states of the system , e.g. concentration of a chemical reagent . the evolution equations for @xmath76 have dissipative character , for they should describe the system s coming to equilibrium , though the initial equations for the system could be of hamiltonian form .",
    "the nos - hoover model may turn out to be of a similar kind and thus helpful in studying interesting physical problems .",
