    "@xcite used the gbm occultation measurements to demonstrate that the 15 - 100 kev flux from the crab had decreased by approximately 7% over the time from launch through august 2010 , and @xcite have presented the gbm observations of the transient be / x - ray binary system a0535 + 26 .",
    "the present paper describes the gbm approach in detail and presents the results of the first three years of gbm earth occultation measurements .",
    "sections 2 - 3 describe the gbm occultation technique . since the method requires a comparison of the measured flux from a particular source just before occultation to the flux just after , the times of occultations must be known . in other words , a predetermined catalog of potential sources",
    "must be used .",
    "the selection of candidate sources is described in section 4 .",
    "systematic effects and the instrument sensitivity are discussed in sections 5 and 6 , and the results of the 3-year gbm occultation catalog are presented in section 7 .",
    "the _ fermi _  gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) consists of 14 detectors : 12 nai detectors , each 12.7 cm in diameter and 1.27 cm thick ( each with effective area @xmath0 @xmath1 at 100 kev ) ; and two bgo detectors , 12.7 cm in diameter and 12.7 cm thick ( each with effective area @xmath2 @xmath1 in the 0.152 mev range ) .",
    "the nai detectors are located on the corners of the spacecraft , with six detectors oriented such that the normals to their faces are perpendicular to the z - axis of the spacecraft ( the lat is pointed in the @xmath3-direction ) , four detectors pointed at @xmath4 from the z - axis , and 2 detectors pointed @xmath5 off the z - axis .",
    "together , these 12 detectors provide nearly uniform coverage of the unocculted sky in the energy range from 8 kev to 1 mev . typically 3 - 4 nai detectors view an earth occultation within 60 degrees of the detector normal vector .",
    "the two bgo detectors are located on opposite sides of the spacecraft and view a large part of the sky in the energy range @xmath6 kev to @xmath7 mev . it should be noted that none of the gbm detectors have direct imaging capability .",
    "gbm has two continuous data types : ctime data with nominal 0.256-second time resolution and 8-channel spectral resolution and cspec data with nominal 4.096-second time resolution and 128-channel spectral resolution .",
    "the catalog results presented in this paper use the lower - spectral resolution ctime data for the nai detectors .",

    "the diameter of the earth as seen from _ fermi _  is @xmath10 , so roughly 30% of the sky is occulted by the earth at any one time .",
    "one complete orbit of the spacecraft allows over 85% of the sky to be observed .",
    "the precession of the orbital plane allows the entire sky to be occulted every @xmath11 days ( half the precession period for the _ fermi _  orbit ) , though the exposure is not uniform .",
    "we have adapted the technique of @xcite for gbm .",
    "this technique involves fitting a model consisting of a quadratic background plus source terms to a short ( @xmath12 min ) window of data centered on the occultation time of the source of interest . for gbm",
    "we have incorporated the changing detector response across the fit window into our source terms .",
    "the @xcite approach , also used with batse , which involved simultaneous fits to an empirical background and numerous source terms over typically an entire day during which each source and the corresponding detector response was assumed constant , is not practical for gbm data due to the rapidly changing detector response .",
    "in addition , the @xcite method resulted in apparent hard tails for several weak sources that were not confirmed with other instruments @xcite .",
    "the primary difference in the implementation of the occultation technique between gbm and batse arises from the different pointing schemes of the respective missions .",
    "_ cgro _ was three - axis stabilized for each viewing period , which typically lasted for two weeks .",
    "this meant that a source remained at a fixed orientation with respect to the detectors through an entire viewing period .",
    "in contrast , _ fermi _  scans the sky by pointing in a direction @xmath13 ( august 2008september 2009 ) or @xmath14 ( october 2009present ) north of the zenith for one orbit ; it then rocks to @xmath13 or @xmath14 south for the next orbit , continuing to alternate every orbit unless the spacecraft goes into a pointed mode ( which occurs rarely ) .",
    "in addition , the spacecraft performs a roll about the z - axis as it orbits so the solar panels face the sun . because the orientation of a source with respect to the gbm detectors varies as a function of time , the detector response also varies with time . a detailed",
    "instrument modeling and measurement program has been used to develop the gbm instrument response as a function of direction @xcite and has produced a database of detector responses for each detector at 272 spacecraft positions . for the occultation analysis we interpolated this database to produce matrices for the same 272 positions using 137 photon input energies ( from 5 kev to 50 mev ) and using 3-year average ctime channel energy edges for each detector and for each of the 8 ctime channel energy edges ( approximately @xmath15 , 12 - 25 , 25 - 50 , 50 - 100 , 100 - 300 , 300 - 500 , 500 - 1000 , @xmath16 kev ) .",
    "custom energy matrices can be constructed using cspec data at full resolution , or in combinations which provide fine resolution in the energy band of interest while maintaining a small number of output channels in the response matrix . in the individual step",
    "fitting , the spacecraft position of each source in the fit is computed as a function of time .",
    "a new response matrix is interpolated from our database using its three nearest neighbors every time the spacecraft moves by @xmath17 .",
    "before any sources are fitted , good time intervals ( gtis ) of gbm data are defined .",
    "the gti intervals from the ctime data files are shortened by 10 s to remove transient events due to gbm high voltage turn - on and turn - off .",
    "a spline model is fitted to the 12 - 25 kev ctime data to eliminate large background deviations , typically on @xmath18s time scales , due to south atlantic anomaly entries and exits , bright solar flares , gamma - ray bursts , and other brief bright events from the gtis .",
    "mission averaged energy channel edges are used in the detector response matrices .",
    "gain variations in individual detectors due to temperatures or other effects are controlled using an on - board automatic gain control to keep the 511 kev line in a particular on - board channel ( one of 4096 ) .",
    "the maximum temperature variation observed to date was @xmath19 c in december 2008 , which corresponds to a gain change of 1.36% , which is negligible . because scintillators are massive compared to semiconductor detectors , temperature changes have much less impact for gbm than for other x - ray missions using semiconductors or ccds .    for each day , the occultation times for each source in the catalog are calculated using the known spacecraft positions .",
    "the time of each occultation step , @xmath20 , is taken to be the time for which the transmission of a 100 kev gamma ray through the atmospheric column is 50% .",
    "a fit window of data , lasting 240 seconds and centered on @xmath20 is used for each step .",
    "the time at which the atmospheric transmission reaches 50% is energy dependent , with lower energies absorbed at lower atmospheric densities so that a setting step will occur earlier than at higher energies ( see fig .",
    "[ crabstep ] ) .",
    "this energy dependence is accounted for in the calculation of the atmospheric transmission function @xmath21 , given by @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the mass attenuation coefficient of gamma rays at photon energy @xmath24 in air[multiblock footnote omitted ] and @xmath25 is the air mass along the line of sight at a given altitude @xmath26 based on the @xcite .",
    "this requires instantaneous knowledge of the spacecraft position , the direction to the source of interest as seen from the spacecraft , and a model of the earth that includes its oblateness .",
    "changes in chemical content with altitude and changes in the atmospheric height with solar activity are not included in the current atmospheric model . atmospheric density measurements with sounding rockets",
    "@xcite show that at mid - latitudes the standard deviation of the density varies from 4% at 30 km to about 20% at 60 km and above . to estimate the effect of these variations on our earth occultation flux measurements , we varied the air mass @xmath25 by 10% and 50% in fits to the crab nebula .",
    "this resulted in changes to the daily crab flux measurements of @xmath27% in the four bands spanning 12 - 300 kev .",
    "therefore we ignore the effects of atmospheric variations in our model .",
    "measuring the flux from the source of interest requires fitting a model to the count rate data .",
    "for each detector viewing the source of interest within 60@xmath28 from the detector normal , within the fit time window , the observed count rate @xmath29 at time @xmath30 in each energy channel @xmath31 is modeled as @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34,and @xmath35 are quadratic",
    "background coefficients , @xmath36 are source models summed for the source of interest and all interfering sources included in the fit , and @xmath37 are the fitted scale factors for each source model .",
    "the background is typically smooth and adequately fitted by the second - order polynomial within the 240 second fit window .",
    "the source count rate models are given by    @xmath38    where @xmath24 are photon energies , matching the input side of the time - dependent detector response matrix , @xmath39 .",
    "the assumed energy spectrum for each source integrated over each photon energy bin , @xmath40 , is combined with the atmospheric transmission @xmath41 and convolved with the detector response @xmath39 to compute the predicted count rate in each energy channel @xmath31 at time @xmath30 .",
    "each energy channel and each detector is fitted independently . for each source term",
    "a scaling factor @xmath42 is fitted , along with the quadratic background coefficients . when multiple detectors are included in the fit ,",
    "the weighted mean for the scaling factor of the source of interest is computed for each energy channel .",
    "the mean scaling factor is then multiplied by the predicted flux in each energy channel to obtain flux measurements for the source of interest .",
    "ideally , each occultation measurement would include the effects of every other source in the sky , but this is not practical to implement .",
    "we have adopted a top - down iterative approach for treating interfering sources .",
    "following @xcite , we have implemented a flare database consisting of times when sources are active and broad levels of activity . for our first iteration",
    ", we have used public _ swift_/bat transient monitor data to populate our flare database .",
    "later iterations will incorporate results from gbm and from the _ swift_/bat survey over a wider energy range .",
    "currently any source that has a 1550 kev flux of 50 mcrab or larger in _ swift_/bat that persists for at least a few days is included in the database . on any particular day in the flare database",
    ", sources are grouped into three classes : ( 1 ) @xmath43 mcrab , ( 2 ) 150500 mcrab , or ( 3 ) 50150 mcrab .",
    "a source s class changes in the database whenever the flux drops or rises into the next class .",
    "if a source changes flux quickly within a single day , the brightest class for that day is retained .",
    "identical source classes are used in the source catalog for persistent sources .",
    "sources in these classes are included as interfering sources if they undergo earth occultation in the fit window and if they are within @xmath44 , @xmath45 , or @xmath46 of the detector normal for classes 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "fainter sources are not currently considered in occultation fits except when they are the source of interest . this paper reports results from our first iteration , in which we treat the brightest sources first to optimize interfering source inclusion .",
    "our code is flexible , so additional source classes can be added if needed in the future to support analysis of fainter sources .",
    "in addition to the flare database , we maintain an eclipse database , containing ephemerides for ten eclipsing sources .",
    "when any of these ten sources are in eclipse , they are not included as interfering sources in step fitting , regardless of their levels set in the catalog or flare database .    at lower energies , especially below about 50 kev",
    ", the sun is a special case of a bright interfering source .",
    "we maintain a solar flare database , built from solar event reports of geostationary operational environment satellites ( goes ) data obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) space weather prediction center . in our solar flare",
    "database we use classes for the flares , based upon the peak goes flux in the flare : ( 1 ) class m or x flares , included as an interfering source if the sun is within @xmath44 of the detector normal , ( 2 ) class c flares , included as an interfering source if the sun is within @xmath45 of the detector normal , and ( 3 ) class b flares , included as an interfering source if the sun is within @xmath46 of the detector normal .",
    "since the sun moves with respect to other sources in the sky , the sun s position is initially calculated for the center of the day .",
    "this position is used to find fit windows that include the sun . at the time",
    "the data are fitted , the sun position at the time of the fit window is calculated to correctly compute the atmospheric transmission .",
    "small errors in the timing of sun steps still exist , because the sun is not a point source and the position of the center of the solar disk is used .",
    "data containing x or m class flares are usually filtered out from the gtis before steps are fitted , so only c class and fainter flares are typically included as interfering sources .",
    "once the steps are fitted , source count rates and errors for the source of interest are written to a flexible image transport system ( fits ) file for each detector along with other information about the fit including the flux and error measurement in each energy channel , the step times , sources included in the fit , detectors , and angles to the source of interest at the time of occultation .",
    "light curves and energy spectra are extracted from these files .",
    "light curves used in this catalog paper have been post - filtered using the following criteria : ( 1 ) occultation steps are excluded if the source of interest occults within 8 seconds of a bright source , if the occultation transition lasts longer than 20 seconds , or if the spacecraft is rapidly slewing with a spin rate @xmath47 rad / s .",

    "integral_/ibis . this initial catalog",
    "was then expanded by adding 14 sources detected using gbm earth occultation imaging @xcite . to prepare for this catalog paper , we did a more thorough effort of source selection , selecting sources detected above @xmath53 mcrab with _ swift_/bat in the transient monitor or in the _",

    "fermi_/lat @xcite . for active galaxies ( agn ) , we selected sources detected with the oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment ( osse ) on cgro and sources detected in the lat 2-year agn catalog @xcite that met the following criteria : ( 1 ) @xmath55 from the galactic plane , ( 2 ) flagged as in the lat clean sample , ( 3 ) classified as either a bl lac with a high synchrotron peak ( hsp ) or classified as a flat spectrum radio quiet source ( fsrq ) with a low synchrotron peak .",
    "the reasoning is that for the bl lacs , the gbm energy range will sample the fall - off of the @xmath56 synchrotron peak while the lat is sampling the ic peak , and for fsrqs , the gbm band will sample the rise of the ic peak while the lat samples the fall of the ic peak ( assuming leptonic processes ) , making these sources more likely to be detectable with gbm , and ( 4 ) a test statistic of @xmath57 in the full lat energy range in the 2-year catalog , to limit this initial sample to the brightest lat sources .",
    "these selections resulted in a catalog , shown in figure  [ fig : capmap ] , containing 209 sources , including 71 active galaxies ( agn ) , 52 low - mass x - ray binary / neutron star ( lmxb / ns ) systems , 40 high - mass x - ray binary / neutron star ( hmxb / ns ) systems ( including 5 supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxt ) ) , 19 black hole candidates ( bhc ) , 8 pulsars ( psr)/pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn)/supernova remnants ( snr ) , 6 cvs , 4 gamma ray binaries , 2 galaxy clusters , 3 stars including the sun , 2 sgrs , 1 globular cluster , and 1 tidal disruption event ( tde ) .",
    "from our experience using the earth occultation technique with batse and with gbm , we have identified the following systematic effects that affect earth occultation flux measurements : ( 1 ) accuracy of the assumed source spectra , ( 2 ) large variations in the background , ( 3 ) duration of the occultation transition , ( 4 ) inaccuracies in the detector response matrices , ( 5 ) occultation limb geometry , and ( 6 ) nearby sources . in this section",
    "we describe our mitigation strategies and our efforts to reduce , account for , or quantify these effects .",
    "we explored the effects of incorrectly assumed source spectra using multiple runs of the earth occultation software for the crab assuming ( 1 ) a canonical spectrum @xcite , ( 2 ) an exponential cut - off spectrum ( with a cutoff energy of 30 kev and e - folding energy of 13.6 kev ) , ( 3 ) the exponential cutoff spectrum plus a 1 mcrab power law with photon index @xmath58 , ( 4 ) a power law with a photon index @xmath59 , and ( 5 ) a hard power law with photon index @xmath60 .",
    "the measured count rates in each step were consistent within errors , indicating that the fitting process is robust , and in particular that the treatment of interfering source steps in the fit window is little affected by the assumed source spectrum .",
    "further we found that the statistical significance of the average flux in each energy channel was consistent for all five assumed spectra .",
    "the flux values showed systematic effects , however .",
    "for the  incorrect \" spectra , models 3 and 4 , fluxes were consistent with the canonical values within 5 - 10% , while model 2 , which changes rapidly at higher energies , and the very hard model 5 showed large flux deviations .",
    "this test was repeated using models 2 - 5 for vela x-1 and the results were the same as for the crab . from 12 to 100 kev , where vela x-1 is detected with gbm ,",
    "count rates and significances were consistent for all models .",
    "model 2 is based upon vela x-1 batse data @xcite .",
    "models 3 and 4 fluxes were within 5 - 10% of model 2 fluxes , while model 5 again showed large deviations .",
    "therefore , the assumed spectrum does not appear to significantly affect detection significance or fits to other sources .",
    "its primary impact is on the reported flux values . for this paper , we have done an extensive literature search to obtain the best published spectra for the sources in our catalog . where appropriate spectra in our energy range are not available , these tests show that model 4 , a power law with photon index @xmath61 , gives fluxes consistent to 5 - 10% with expected models for both a harder source ( crab ) and a softer source ( vela x-1 ) .",
    "we have adopted model 4 as a generic flux model for sources lacking spectra in the gbm energy range or for sources with rapidly changing spectra .",
    "as described in section  [ sec : bat_gbm ] we have also compared our results with _ swift_/bat in overlapping energy bands , where we generally found good agreement .    because the background and sources are fit simultaneously , variations in the background that can not be fitted with a quadratic function will be absorbed into the source terms and can potentially affect source measurements . for all of these background effects , our mitigation strategy is to exclude these data from the occultation flux measurements .",
    "we performed an investigation where we examined the ctime count rates in the 12 - 25 kev band for times when we saw large outliers for earth occultation flux measurements for the crab , cen a , and a few additional sources .",
    "these outliers frequently corresponded to times with large variations in the background , such as large slopes due to saa entry or exit , bright ( x or m class ) solar flares , or intervals where _ fermi _",
    "is slewing or rotating rapidly . to mitigate these effects ,",
    "we pre - filter the data , fitting a spline model to the 12 - 25 kev rates and excluding intervals with large deviations from this smooth model from the gtis , so that these data are not used for occultation step fitting .",
    "this pre - filtering eliminates saa entries and exits and bright solar flares from further analysis and is believed effective in eliminating similar effects that we have not yet identified .",
    "the spacecraft spin - rate is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the instantaneous angular velocity components for the spacecraft , available in public spacecraft position history files from the _ fermi _  science support center .",
    "for this catalog , fit windows with spin - rates @xmath64 rad s@xmath65 were flagged and excluded from further analysis .",
    "this is an adjustable parameter in the occultation software , which is currently set conservatively to eliminate steps where the high - spin rate adversely affects the fitting .",
    "an earth occultation has a finite transition time due to the effect of absorption in the earth s atmosphere . since the orbital period of the spacecraft is @xmath66 minutes , the individual occultation steps last for @xmath67 seconds , where @xmath68 is defined as the elevation angle of the source being occulted with respect to the plane of the _ fermi _  orbit . since the _ fermi _  orbit has an inclination of 25.6@xmath28 , sources with declinations larger than @xmath69 undergo intervals where they are no longer occulted",
    "when @xmath70 these sources are still being occulted , but the occultations are very broad , lasting @xmath71 seconds .",
    "our analysis has shown that our flux measurements become unreliable if the transition lasts longer than about 20 seconds , so we flag these long duration steps and exclude them from further analysis .    the most noticeable systematic effect arising from the detector response matrices",
    "are solar panel occultations of sources . in the mass model for _ fermi _  used to derive the responses ,",
    "the solar panels are included at a fixed orientation , with the top rotated in the @xmath72 direction by @xmath5 ( where @xmath73 is vertical alignment in the y - z plane ) .",
    "the true solar panel orientation is not fixed , and may block a source , an effect that is particularly severe at low energies .",
    "the discrepancy between the modeled response assuming a fixed solar panel orientation and the true response to the source yields predicted blockages that do not occur or real blockages that are not predicted . to account for either of these issues , we have defined potential solar panel blockage regions in spacecraft coordinates for each detector based upon the full - range of motion of the solar panels .",
    "if the source of interest or an interfering source is in that region in spacecraft coordinates , that detector is excluded from occultation step fitting .",
    "typically this blockage only occurs in 1 - 2 nai detectors , and a flux measurement based on unblocked detectors is calculated where possible .",
    "in addition to the solar panel blockage regions , we have identified two small regions where crab , sco x-1 , or cyg x-1 occultations were obviously blocked in nai 11 , based upon low - flux measurements only in nai 11 .",
    "these blockage regions are believed to be due to small structures on the spacecraft that were not included in the response model , so nai 11 data is excluded from fits if any sources included in the fit are in this region .",
    "photopeak efficiencies measured during the _ fermi _  source survey ( with the solar panels folded ) agree with the mass model simulations to within 5% rms for detectors with source angles @xmath74 confirming the accuracy of the responses for larger spacecraft structures @xcite .",
    "every @xmath75 days , the _ fermi _  orbit precesses so that the earth occultation limb geometry ( i.e. the projection of the earth s limb on the sky ) repeats at this period . for a particular geometry , earth occultation flux measurements may be systematically low or high due to unmodelled sources or non - point source backgrounds such as galactic ridge emission .",
    "these systematic effects can be very difficult to identify . to mitigate these effects , we use _ swift_/bat data to populate a flare database listing times and brightness levels for potentially interfering sources .",
    "this database is updated with current flares and if past flares were missed , they can be added and the occultation code rerun . using earth occultation imaging @xcite , combined with existing catalogs of known source locations",
    ", we identified 14 sources detected with @xmath76 significance that were not initially included in the earth occultation catalog .",
    "these sources were added to the catalog .",
    "the catalog and flare database continue to be iteratively updated to extract our best results .    nearby sources , especially bright or highly variable sources , can make occultation measurements very difficult .",

    "the occultation duration @xmath78 varies as @xmath80 seconds , where @xmath68 is the elevation angle between the source and the orbital plane of _ fermi_. the angular resolution ranges from @xmath81 at @xmath82 to @xmath83 at @xmath84 .",
    "when @xmath85 , occultations no longer occur .",
    "some remaining nearby source effects are relatively easy to identify , e.g the bright outburst of a0535 + 26 in december 2009 that is visible in the raw crab light curve .",
    "when these effects can be easily identified , we manually flag these data and exclude them from further analysis .",

    "<S> the gamma ray burst monitor ( gbm ) on board _ fermi _  has been providing continuous data to the astronomical community since 2008 august 12 . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of the analysis of the first three years of these continuous data using the earth occultation technique to monitor a catalog of 209 sources . from this catalog , </S>",
    "<S> we detect 99 sources , including 40 low - mass x - ray binary / neutron star systems , 31 high - mass x - ray binary neutron star systems , 12 black hole binaries , 12 active galaxies , 2 other sources , plus the crab nebula , and the sun . </S>",
    "<S> nine of these sources are detected in the 100 - 300 kev band , including seven black - hole binaries , the active galaxy cen a , and the crab . </S>",
    "<S> the crab and cyg x-1 are also detected in the 300 - 500 kev band . </S>",
    "<S> gbm provides complementary data to other sky - monitors below 100 kev and is the only all - sky monitor above 100 kev . </S>",
    "<S> up - to - date light curves for all of the catalog sources can be found at http://heastro.phys.lsu.edu / gbm/. </S>"
