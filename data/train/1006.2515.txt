    "within the framework of classical force fields , the number of computer experiments on saccharides has grown considerably in recent years , and various systems have been addressed@xcite .",
    "devising a realistic model of monosaccharides is obviously a decisive step in order for carbohydrates simulations to have enough predictive power .",
    "the accurate description of monosaccharides with classical force fields is not an easy task , because of the delicate interplay of different factors such as the presence of a high number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds , the competition of these hydrogen bonds with water - sugar ones and important steric and electrostatic effects between ring substituents in spatial proximity ( see for example ref .   and references within ) .",
    "the problem of reproducing some carbohydrates peculiarities , such as the rotameric distribution of the hydroxymethyl group or the anomeric and exo - anomeric effects , have been addressed in various force fields , and the reader can find some comparative analyses in refs .  .",
    "however , considerably less attention has been devoted so far to the correct reproduction of the ring conformational properties .",
    "cyclic monosaccharides can appear indeed as puckered rings , and their conformational transitions dramatically alter the equilibrium properties of both single sugar rings as well as those in oligo and polysaccharides@xcite . despite the large number of possible puckered conformers , many biologically relevant monosaccharides in the pyranoid form appear almost always in one stable puckered conformation , the second most populated state being so unlikely not to be detectable by actual experimental techniques . in spite of that ,",
    "several authors reported an inappropriately high percentage of secondary puckered conformations@xcite when modeling carbohydrates using classical force fields such as gromos@xcite or opls - aa@xcite for simulations of sugars in solution . regarding the latest gromos parameter set for carbohydrates ( 45a4)@xcite",
    ", non - chair conformers have been shown to be accessible during equilibrium simulation runs of @xmath1-d - glucose%@xcite , and two recent works@xcite estimated the free energy difference between chair conformers to be at least 10 kj / mol lower than most theoretical and ab - initio simulation results .",
    "besides equilibrium simulations , the importance of ring puckering has been proven by simulated pulling experiments , employed to interprete single molecule force - spectroscopy data@xcite . in this case ,",
    "ring conformational transitions simulated using three different force fields ( amber94@xcite , amber - glycam@xcite and charmm - parm22/su01@xcite ) led to different interpretation of the same experimental data@xcite . having control on the reliability of force fields in reproducing puckering properties would certainly improve the predictivity of computer simulations of saccharides .",
    "it is hence understandable how desirable is a reparametrization of those force fields which present unphysical ring conformers .",
    "this difficult task , however , is made even more arduous by the lack of experimental estimates of conformers populations , as the only monosaccharide investigated so far is idose@xcite .",
    "this work aims at filling , at least partially , these gaps .",
    "on one hand we estimated the chair conformers populations of altrose , obtained from the assignement of its @xmath2h nmr spectrum . on the other hand",
    ", we performed a combined metadynamics ",
    "umbrella sampling investigation@xcite of the puckering properties of all @xmath0 and @xmath1-d - aldopyranoses , modeled using the gromos 45a4 parameter set@xcite , and identified a new set of parameters that satisfactorily reproduces the puckering free energies of the main ring conformers .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : problem ] the problems related to the determination of puckering free energy landscape will be presented ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : nmr ] the results of an nmr investigation of altropyranose conformers populations are presented ; in sec .  [ sec : methods ] the combined metadynamics  umbrella sampling will be discussed , as well as the use of cremer  pople puckering coordinates@xcite , their peculiarities as collective variables , and the simulation details ; in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] the puckering free energy profile obtained with the gromos 45a4 force field for @xmath1-d - glucose is discussed in detail and compared to recent similar calculations@xcite . in sec",
    "[ sec : parameters ] we present the puckering free energy profiles of the whole @xmath0 and @xmath1 series of d - aldohexoses modeled with the gromos 45a4 force field , showing that the puckering free energies are so poorly reproduced , that the inverted chair conformers of galactose , mannose and @xmath0-d - glc become significantly populated . subsequently , we propose a change to the 45a4 parameter set , showing how the free energies obtained with the use of the new parameter set compare favorably with available theoretical and experimental data .",
    "eventually , some concluding remarks are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this work we are focusing on a particular class of carbohydrates , namely , aldohexoses , saccharides of composition c@xmath3h@xmath4o@xmath3 .",
    "aldohexoses can appear in nature in the form of six - membered , cyclic rings , conventionally known as the pyranose form .",
    "pyranoses are characterized by the presence of five chiral centers located at the five ring carbon atoms . following the convention of fig .",
    "[ fig : numbering ] , these chiral carbons are here denoted as c1 ( the anomeric carbon atom ) , c2 , c3 , c4 and c5 ( the configurational carbon atom ) .",
    "this leads to quite a high number ( @xmath5 ) of diastereoisomers , characterized by the axial or equatorial orientation of ring substitutents .",
    "based on the chirality at c1 and c5 it is possible to classify pyranoses into @xmath0- and @xmath1-pyranoses or l- and d - pyranoses , respectively  @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath0-d - glc and @xmath1-l - glc differ from @xmath1-d - glc only by the chirality at c1 and c5 , respectively .    for each of these two chiralities , @xmath6",
    "stereoisomers remain , which are conventionally named  @xcite glucose ( glc ) , galactose ( gal ) , mannose ( man ) , allose ( all ) , altrose ( alt ) , talose ( tal ) , gulose ( gul ) and idose ( ido ) . the position of substituents at the chiral centres",
    "are reported for convenience in tab .",
    "[ tab : chirality ] , for @xmath1-d - aldopyranoses .",
    ".orientation of ring substituents ( ax : axial ; eq : equatorial ) for different stereoisomers ( referred to the @xmath7c@xmath8 conformer).[tab : chirality ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      energies are expressed in kj / mol , angles are in rad , and probabilities in percent ; @xmath9 free energy of @xmath2c@xmath10 ; @xmath11 next most populated conformer after @xmath7c@xmath8 and @xmath2c@xmath10 ; @xmath12 free energy of the next most populated conformer ; @xmath13 location of the transition state ( @xmath14,@xmath15 ) ; @xmath16 free energy of the transition state ; @xmath17 population of @xmath7c@xmath8 ( % ) ; @xmath18 population of @xmath2c@xmath10 ( % ) ; @xmath19 population of the next most populated conformer . when a basin is present , which encompasses many states , all conformers involved are listed .",
    "in addition to the interactions discussed so far , to reproduce correctly the gap between the @xmath2c@xmath10 free energy curves of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 series  as it is apparent , for example , in the theoretical data presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : series45a4 ]  the torsional interaction for the c3c2c1o1 present in the 45a4 set has to be modified . the chirality of the c1 carbon atom differs only between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 anomers , and is certainly playing a role in modulating the height of the free energy gap between @xmath0 and @xmath1 anomers .",
    "eventually , corrections to the energy term associated to the dihedral c4c3c2o2 were proven to enhance the agreement to the theoretical estimates .    in summary ,",
    "the phase and amplitude of the c3c2c1o1 , c4c3c2o2 , c1c2c3o3 , c5c4c3o3 and c1o5c5c6 torsional interaction were tuned by trial and errors in order to obtain @xmath2c@xmath10 free energy curves in better agreement with experimental and theoretical data .",
    "the set of torsional interactions and their parameters for the proposed modification to the 45a4 parameter set are reported in tab .",
    "[ tab : newparameters ] , and the full gromacs topologies are provided at ` http://www.science.unitn.it/~sega/sugars.html ` it is worth mentioning that the strength of the c1c2c3o3 and c5c4c3o3 torsional interactions had to be set to a much higher value ( 2.4 kj / mol ) than that of the other ones involving three ring atoms and one hydroxyl oxygen . given the similar chemical nature of the quadruplets of atoms involved ( beside that of the anomeric oxygen ) , such asymmetry appears to be peculiar .",
    "this might originate either from the fact that the o3 oxygen can be involved in the 1,3-trans - diaxial interaction with the hydroxymethyl group ( stronger than that with any other oh groups ) or from other interaction terms already present in the 45a4 set , whose influence on the puckering free energy is not yet understood , and that might deserve a separate investigation .",
    "the new parametrization of the gromos force field for sugars was performed with the aim not to change properties other than puckering , and dihedral interactions directly involved in the rotameric distribution of the hydroxymethyl group were thus not changed .",
    "this choice alone , however , is no guarantee that this quantity is not affected .",
    "we checked explicitly that these modifications did not affect the rotameric distribution of the hydroxymethyl group , calculating the free energy profile of the c4c5c6o6 torsional angle ( @xmath20 ) for the 45a4 and new sets of parameters .",
    "the results obtained with the two parameter sets did not differ more than @xmath21 between each other .",
    "the free energy surfaces have been calculated using the same metadynamics / umbrella sampling approach employed for the calculation of the puckering free energy , but using a gaussian width of 0.1 rad for biasing the @xmath20 variable .",
    "we summarized the results obtained using our modified set of parameters in figs .",
    "[ fig : seriesnew],[fig : newprofilesb],[fig : newprofilesa ] and tab .",
    "[ tab : seriesnew ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : seriesnew ] the free energy differences between inverted chair and chair conformers are compared again with the theoretical predictions of ref .   and ref .  .",
    "the improvement with respect to the results obtained with the 45a4 set ( fig .",
    "[ fig : series45a4 ] ) is striking .",
    "both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 series reproduce now the qualitative trend of the theoretical estimates .",
    "galactose , mannose , and talose are not anymore below the @xmath22 threshold , and the value of gulose , altrose and idose free energies diminished considerably . also the gap between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 anomers is now reproduced reasonably well , being on average @xmath23kj / mol . noticeably , the height of the free energy barrier of @xmath1-d - glc has been increased considerably , from @xmath24kj / mol to @xmath25kj / mol .",
    "this increase , which changes dramatically the kinetics of the conformational transition of @xmath1-d - glc , has no counterpart in any other @xmath26anomer .",
    "the situation for @xmath27anomers is slightly different , because the height of the free energy barrier close to @xmath7c@xmath8 increased markedly for @xmath0-d - tal and @xmath0-d - gul and , at the same time , decreased for @xmath0-d - all and @xmath0-d - alt .",
    "unfortunately , the population of inverted chairs in @xmath0-d - ido is still lower than that of chairs , whereas both theory and experiment show a preference for the @xmath2c@xmath10 conformer .",
    "however , given the fact that these changes are not sugar - specific , the result obtained is to our opinion still remarkable , as the ability to reproduce puckering properties has increased dramatically , with respect to the 45a4 set .",
    "we addressed the problem of the proper modelling of pyranoses puckering properties using the gromos force field . a serious problem in such a task is the lack of experimental information on the conformer populations of stereoisomers of glucose other than idose .",
    "to fill this gap , we performed the first measurement of altrose chair conformers population by assigning the complete coupling pattern of its @xmath2h nmr spectrum .",
    "the estimated populations are in agreement within roughly 5 kj / mol with available theoretical analyses based on semiempirical and molecular mechanical models , thus confirming their reliability .",
    "the theoretical estimates have been therefore emploied as target values for the subsequent reparametrization of the force field , for sugars other than idose and altrose .",
    "the realism in reproducing the population of inverted chairs of pyranoses modeled using the 45a4 parameter set of the gromos force field leaves much to be desired : galactose , mannose , allose , and @xmath0-d - glc present a sizable population of the inverted chair conformer , while the population of the inverted chair conformer of idose resulted to be negligible in simulation , contrarily to experimental evidence .",
    "we devised a new set of parameters which has proven to be quite successful in recovering the trend of the inverted chair free energy for all 16 stereoisomers under study .",
    "our parametrization reproduces free energy differences in accordance with experimental and theoretical data always within 5 kj / mol , but in most cases within 2.5 kj / mol , that is , @xmath28 . a closer agreement with the theoretical models",
    "is probably not needed , given the uncertainties to which they are subjected . indeed , while the theoretical models do not provide any confidence interval , an approximate picture can be obtained by comparing them with the experimental data on idose@xcite and altrose ( this work ) , which roughly fall within a 3 kj / mol interval .",
    "the improvement attained with the introduction of this new parameter set is to our opinion substantial , and reached the goal of reproducing known puckering free energy differences while keeping other properties , such as inter - molecular interactions and the rotameric distribution of the hydroxymethyl group , unchanged .",
    "these modifications to the gromos force field will allow to perform more realistic simulations of d - aldopyranoses .",
    "they represent a certain improvement in the study of carbohydrate equilibrium properties , but will have an even more important impact on the evaluation of out - of - equilibrium properties , such as in the case of simulated afm pulling experiments .",
    "still , much has to be done regarding the puckering properties of carbohydrates .",
    "in particular , the role of skew conformations  possibly detected in nmr experiments@xcite but not significantly present in both the 45a4 and new parameter sets  has to be clarified .",
    "other pyranosides and furanoses should also be investigated to further test the force field .",
    "the gromos force field , however , is not the only one which has been found to be problematic in reproducing proper puckering properties , and for many force fields the investigations of ring conformer populations are scarce , if not missing at all .",
    "our hope is that , beside the usefluness related to the specific case of the gromos force field parametrization , this work could also serve to attract attention to the importance of the puckering problem in carbohydrate simulations , and to stimulate further investigations .",
