    "the theory of universal finite size scaling ( fss ) functions has been broadly used in simulations of finite systems close to criticality in order to extrapolate numerical results to the thermodynamic limit @xcite . in two - dimensional square lattices with rectangular shape of sizes @xmath4 , it is known that those functions depend on the aspect ratio @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the propierties of universal fss functions when the aspect ratio , as well as boundary conditions , are changed have been studied in different situations @xcite-@xcite .    in the context of percolation theory @xcite ,",
    "the analysis of the effects of rectangular boundaries in the spanning probability was studied by langlands @xcite , who showed numerically that , at the critical threshold , there exists a universal scaling function of the aspect ratio .",
    "the study was based on symmetry arguments for the crossing probabilities .",
    "inspired by the numerical results of langlands , cardy @xcite derived an analytical expression using the conformal invariance of the spanning probability in 2d percolation .",

    ", the effects of rectangular shape as well as different boundary conditions in the fss functions have not been studied in the two - dimensional random field ising model ( rfim ) with athermal dynamics @xcite , where we expect that quenched disorder as well as the metastable character of the dynamics strongly determine the spanning cluster @xcite .    the athermal ( t=0 ) rfim has been commonly used to explain the barkhausen noise in ferromagnetic materials@xcite . in many cases ,",
    "ferromagnetic coupling is so strong that it is not necessary to consider temperature as a relevant parameter in the model . during the field",
    "driven magnetization process , free energy barriers are so large that thermally activated events are negligible . by considering interaction between spins , quenched disorder in the sample and external magnetic field , the rfim offers a good explanation of hysteresis and crackling noise ( avalanche dynamics ) .",
    "the model is also applicable to other physical systems such as structural transitions , capillary condensation of gases in porous solids , etc @xcite@xcite .",
    "all these phenomena share in common the existence of a first order phase transition and hysteresis .",
    "metastable states separated by high energy barriers appear in the free energy landscape .",
    "when the external force is increased ( for example the magnetic field ) , the conjugated variable ( magnetization ) responds discontinuously .",
    "these non - equilibrium collective events , known as avalanches , are essentially due to the system jumps from one metastable state to another .",
    "the properties of these avalanches depend strongly on the quenched disorder present in the system , determining which sites of the system are more favourable to nucleate or not .",
    "the lower critical dimension of the rfim is known to be @xmath6 in the equilibrium case @xcite .",
    "this implies that ferromagnetic order will not occur for @xmath7 .",
    "it is not completely settled if the lower critical dimension is still @xmath6 for the rfim with local metastable dynamics at t=0 .",
    "j.p.sethna and coworkers opened the door to a possible existence of long range order in this case @xcite . nevertheless , it has been necessary to examine larger system sizes in order to determine whether the critical value of the model parameter determining the amount of the quenched disorder @xmath8 was finite or not , in the thermodynamic limit . recently ,",
    "d.spasojevi and coworkers found numerical evidence of a critical point , below which @xmath9 the system orders ferromagnetically .",
    "these evidences were based on the fss collapse of the curves corresponding to magnetization@xcite , distribution of avalanche sizes@xcite and number of spanning avalanches@xcite .    in order to study the effect of the aspect ratio and boundary conditions in universal fss functions we will focus on the number of spanning avalanches in one direction @xcite@xcite .",
    "spanning avalanches , strictly speaking , are well defined objects only in finite size simulations with square or rectangular boundaries .",
    "they correspond to magnetization events of size @xmath10 that extend , at least , from one side of the system to the opposite one .",
    "they can be classified as 1d - spanning or 2d - spanning , depending on whether they span the system in one , or two spatial directions .",
    "nevertheless in the thermodynamic limit such avalanches correspond to infinite objects not necessarily massive ( i.e. @xmath11 ) similar to the infinite cluster @xcite within percolation theory .",
    "different strategies may help in understanding the critical nature of such objects .",
    "a first possibility is to study its behaviour when changing the shape of the finite system , by simulating not only square , but rectangular boundary conditions with a certain aspect ratio @xmath12 .",
    "a second strategy is to study spanning objects when changing the physical nature of the finite boundaries .",
    "numerical simulations , often use periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) .",
    "such spatial boundaries are the most adequate to minimize finite size effects when studying a first order phase transition that occurs due to a local nucleation process .",
    "nevertheless , some forced boundary conditions may help in the understanding of models with propagating front dynamics .",
    "typically this is done by keeping periodic boundaries in one direction and fixing the boundaries in the other direction to be in the two different coexisting phases .",
    "we will refer to these fixed boundary conditions as fbc .",
    "seppl et al.@xcite found evidence of front roughening effects in the equilibrium rfim at @xmath0 with fbc without external field . the model with metastable dynamics but restricted to nucleation close to the interface ,",
    "was studied in the context of depinning transition @xcite , and for the study of morphological changes in the invading front @xcite .",
    "the ground state of the equilibrium 3d - rfim was studied by middelton and fisher using a variety of fixed boundary conditions and comparing with periodic boundaries @xcite    in this work , we present a numerical study of the number of 1d - spanning avalanches @xmath13 in the metastable two - dimensional rfim using the two strategies described above .",

    "we will obtain fss functions that include the dependence with the aspect ratio @xmath12 .",
    "the analysis of fbc and different aspect ratios is presented in section [ fbc ] . in this case",
    "we obtain fss functions with two additive contributions : the first is the same as for pbc and the second one is related to a roughening transition of the interface .",
    "finally a summary and conclusions are presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "ising models consist of an ensemble of n interactive spins situated at the nodes of a d - dimensional lattice .",
    "spins can take the values @xmath15 .",
    "the rfim is a variant of these kind of models which includes quenched disorder ( impurities , dislocations , vacancies , etc . )",

    "@xmath1 is the external field and @xmath18 are local quenched random fields , independent and gaussian distributed according to : @xmath19 where @xmath20 characterizes the amount of disorder present in the system .",
    "we study a 2d square lattice with rectangular shape ( @xmath21 ) . in order to generate a metastable dynamics",
    ", it is necessary to stablish a criterion to determine under which conditions the system remains in a local minimum of the energy landscape .",
    "following sethna s rule@xcite , a spin is stable when it is aligned with its effective field : @xmath22 where the sum extends over the @xmath2 neighbours of the spin @xmath23 , which in the case of a 2-d square lattice is @xmath24 . following this deterministic rule",
    ", a spin flips when its effective field changes sign .",
    "a flipping event changes the value @xmath25 of its nearest neighbours and any of these could become unstable .",
    "the process continues in the same way analysing successive shells and originating an avalanche of flipping spins .",
    "the size @xmath10 of the avalanche corresponds to the number of spins that have changed their state whereas the duration @xmath26 corresponds to the number of shells needed to complete the avalanche .",
    "simulations start with all the spins pointing down ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 .",
    "the external field is increased until a spin triggers an avalanche .",
    "then the external field is kept constant until there are no more unstable spins and the system reaches a metastable state again .",
    "the dynamical process finishes when all the spins are pointing up ( @xmath29 ) for a very large postive value of the field @xmath1 .",
    "sorted list algorithm has been implemented@xcite . since",
    "our intention is not to discuss the behaviour in the thermodynamic limit but to understand fss relations , it has been preferable to study characteristic sizes of @xmath30 and perform a number of averages over many ( @xmath31 ) randomness realizations .",
    "the range of aspect ratios @xmath12 for which results presented in this work are valid ranges from @xmath32 to @xmath33 . for illustrative purposes we will also show numerical results for smaller values of @xmath12 ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "the field driven , athermal rfim with the standard pbc and @xmath36 has been broadly studied @xcite-@xcite . by numerical analysis",

    "power - law distributions are found in some magnitudes related to avalanches in this situation ( sizes and durations ) .",
    "for the regime @xmath39 , the magnetization process takes place by nucleation of small domains that grow and coallesce and there is no presence of spanning avalanches ( see fig .",

    "[ fig:3 ] ( a ) , the number of 1d spanning avalanches exhibits a peak at the value of disorder @xmath42 as found by spasojevi et al .",
    "these peaks present the following scaling behaviour : @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the fss function related to the number of 1d spanning avalanches for pbc ( see fig .  [ fig:3](b ) ) ) .",
    "these values are compatible with those of @xcite.the error bars of the fitted parameters account for variations that still offer acceptable collapses .",
    "we use the calligraphic letter @xmath47 for the scaling functions with pbc . note that in this case , contrarily to what happens in the 3d case @xcite , the number of 1d spanning avalanches vanishes in the thermodynamic limit due to the negative sign of the exponent @xmath48 . in the present work ,",
    "we will study pbc with rectangular shape and thus we have to separate spanning avalanches in the @xmath49 and @xmath50 direction .",
    "therefore we will measure @xmath51 , @xmath52 , where we have chosen a dependence on the disorder @xmath20 , the horizontal width @xmath53 and the aspect ratio @xmath5 . in order to perform the fss analysis we need to find a scaling variable for this rectangular case .",
    "the geometric average length @xmath54 is used in @xcite for fss of asymmetric systems of percolating sticks .",
    "we have checked that , with this choice of the scaling length it is not possible to achieve collapses for different aspect ratios .",
    "we propose an alternative choice of the scaling length that enables to collapse curves for different sizes as well as aspect ratios @xmath12 . due to the asymmetry ( @xmath55 )",

    "this issue was already proposed in the first works on the rfim @xcite and was extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "the direction for easy percolation is the one which first limits a 1d spanning avalanche .",
    "thus , in the limits of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , a finite system will experience pseudo - critical effects when the correlation length approaches to : @xmath61 the function @xmath62 exhibits a discontinuous derivative at @xmath63 . in order to avoid it ,",
    "we propose to measure the limit of the correlation length as : @xmath64 and the corresponding scaling variable : @xmath65 note that this choice results in @xmath66 for the limits @xmath59 and @xmath60 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : escalatprevi ] , curve collapses for 1d spanning avalanches in the @xmath50 or @xmath49 direction are achieved independently for each aspect ratio .",

    "strictly speaking , we only show data for @xmath70 but one must take into acount that the number of 1d spanning avalanches satisfies the following symmetry : @xmath71 a similar expression was proposed in @xcite for the spanning probability in percolation theory . if one applies this symmetry to eq .",
    "( [ eq : primerescalaty ] ) , the following relation between fss functions must be fulfilled : @xmath72 in order to assert the dependence of the scaling functions on the aspect ratio @xmath12 , we propose that these functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be written in the following way : @xmath75 @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 are functions of the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "note that the functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 are different if one is considering 1d spanning avalanches in the @xmath50 or @xmath49 direction .    from the study of the peak heights @xmath79 a good fit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fits ] ) can be obtained with : @xmath80 where @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "one must take into account that @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 have an empirical character and play no role in the following developments .",
    "note that this choice satisfies the symmetry : @xmath87 from this last equality and equations  ( [ eq : descomposiciox ] ) and  ( [ eq : descomposicioy ] ) one obtains : @xmath88 which means that , in fact , we can formulate a scaling function @xmath89 independent of the spatial direction .",
    "taking into account all these premises , satisfactory collapses of the whole set of numerical data are obtained with the following fss hypothesis : @xmath90 @xmath91 overlaps for peaks corresponding to @xmath70 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : escalat ] .",
    "the idea behind imposing fbc is to force simulations to exhibit a domain wall which can be identified as an advancing front ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sequencia ] ) . from a physical point of view",
    ", this would represent a situation in which the system under study is a subset of a bigger one with an already formed interface . by keeping periodic boundaries in the vertical @xmath49 direction ,",
    "the horizontal @xmath50 direction is subjected to the following condition : at the boundary @xmath92 , there is a column of spins @xmath93 ( + symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : sequencia ] ) whereas at @xmath94 there is a column of spins @xmath95 ( - symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : sequencia ] ) . under these specific conditions ,",
    "1d spanning avalanches in the @xmath49 direction are more common in a regime of low disorder . a minuscule fraction of 1d spanning avalanches in the @xmath50 direction and 2-d spanning avalanches are found but with no relevant statistical weight .",
    "when the system presents a stripe geometry ( @xmath96 ) , it is easy to distinguish four different regimes for the dynamics of 1d spanning avalanches as a function of the disorder @xmath20 . below a certain value of the quenched disorder , @xmath97 , a sequence of massive spanning avalanches with flat interface appears during the magnetization process",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sequencia ] sequence a - b - c ) .",
    "as disorder increases , there exists a regime @xmath98 where the advancing front presents a rough profile and there is a negligible presence of nucleated domains in front of the advancing interface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sequencia ] d - e - f ) ) .",
    "when the disorder approaches its critical value ( @xmath99 ) , the critical interface advances interacting with many nucleated domains ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sequencia ] g - h - i ) ) . above @xmath8 ,",
    "it is unlikely to find a 1d spanning avalanche so the front is ill - defined except for some very rare cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sequencia ] j - k - l ) ) . for higher disorders ,",
    "a pure nucleation and growth process is recovered .",
    "the main goal of this section is to study the consequence of changing the nature of the boundaries on the fss functions and to relate them in the regime dominated by critical effects with those found with pbc for any aspect ratio @xmath12 .    as it can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:512 ] ( a ) , two steps are clearly distinguished in the behavior of the number of 1d spanning avalanches @xmath100",
    ". the higher step on the left is related to the morphological transition of the propagating front .",
    "this transition separates the regimes where there is a sequence of 1d spanning avalanches with a flat profile ( faceted growth ) and the regime where 1d spanning avalanches exhibit a certain rough profile .",
    "the second step occurs in the region @xmath101 where , in the case of pbc , the peaks are found .",
    "this suggests that steps are related to the critical transition .",
    "note that at low disorder the average number of spanning avalanches @xmath102 reaches values above @xmath103 whereas for similar system sizes and disorder @xmath104 with pbc is negligible ( see fig .  [ fig:3 ] ( a ) ) .",
    "a qualitative argument to justify such a difference is given as follows : in the low disorder regime , local fields take values around zero . as spins near the boundary @xmath105 have a neighbour which is pointing up @xmath93 the external field needs to be around @xmath106 in order to flip them and create a nucleation centre for a 1d spanning avalanche that propagates in the @xmath49 direction .",
    "in the model with pbc , the external field needs to be around @xmath107 in order to flip a spin and generate a nucleation centre which can span the system in one or two directions .",
    "when the system is subjected to fbc , it is very difficult to find a horizontal spanning avalanche which connects both sides of the system with fixed boundaries as well as 2d spanning avalanches .",
    "in order to elucidate how the height of the observed steps depend on the system size and shape , simulations at different @xmath53 and @xmath108 have been performed .",
    "results for fixed @xmath53 and different aspect ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:512 ] ( b ) .",
    "note that the height of the step on the left does not depend on @xmath12 .",
    "this indicates that the horizontal length @xmath53 controls the number of 1d spanning avalanches at low disorders . by changing the aspect ratio , the morphology of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig:512 ] ( b ) changes .",
    "when @xmath12 is lower than unity , which means that the system is dominated by periodic boundaries , critical effects are strengthened and what seemed to be a step for @xmath63 becomes a clear peak . as the aspect ratio increases , the sides of the system which are subjected to fixed boundaries take over and critical effects are gradually hindered .",
    "this suggests that , in the critical region , the invariance under 90 degree rotations is recovered for disorders close to @xmath8 and the same analysis as in the previous section can be performed .",
    "the discussion above suggests that we shall propose a combined fss relation with parameters related to both transitions ( @xmath8,@xmath109 ) in order to achieve partial curve collapse . for a certain aspect ratio ,",
    "the scaling hypothesis is : @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the scaling variable in the roughening regime with @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "this choice of the scaling variable @xmath114 was already proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it means that the roughening transition occurs for a certain value of the disorder only due to finite size effects .",
    "faceted growth will not be present in the thermodynamic limit for gaussian random fields as also explained by ji and robbins @xcite .",
    "we will use the calligraphic letter @xmath115 for the fss functions corresponding to fbc .",
    "partial collapses in the roughening regime are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a12 ] ( a ) for @xmath32 , fig .",
    "[ fig : a34 ] ( a ) for @xmath116 , fig .",
    "[ fig : combinedfss ] ( a ) for @xmath63 , and fig .",
    "[ fig : a2 ] for @xmath33 . curves clearly overlap when the scaling variable is below @xmath117 aproximately .    the second term of eq .",

    "[ fig : a34 ] ( b ) for @xmath116 and in fig .",
    "[ fig : combinedfss ] ( b ) for @xmath63 .",
    "note that the hypothesis of combined fss remains valid for different aspect ratios where the critical effects have more presence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a12 ] ) or have practically disappeared ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a2 ] ) .",
    "finally , let us test the relation between fss functions for pbc and fbc in the critical region .",
    "[ fig : equival ] shows that indeed , both fss functions are equivalent : @xmath118 note that we achieve partial overlaps of data corresponding to fbc and pbc and corresponding to @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath14 , @xmath121 .",
    "consequently , the fss function @xmath122 does not depend on @xmath12 neither on the nature of the boundary conditions .",
    "note that , the smaller ( larger ) the aspect ratio the broader ( tiny ) the range of agreement between fss functions .",
    "this makes sense since , as explained in fig .",
    "[ fig:512](b ) , for aspect ratios greater than unity critical effects are hindered .",
    "the left tails of peaks found for pbc can not be related with the curves for fbc . in that regime and for the studied system",
    "sizes the presence of the fbc is still too strong to appreciate critical effects .",
    "in this work we have presented results corresponding to the field driven , athermal rfim with local relaxation dynamics with pbc and fbc and rectangular geometries with different aspect ratios @xmath12 .",
    "we have proposed a new scaling variable @xmath123 with this choice , the average number of 1d spanning avalanches in @xmath50 and @xmath49 directions can be scaled as : @xmath124 where the functions @xmath125 depend on wether we study 1d spanning avalanches in the @xmath50 or @xmath49 direction and satisfy : @xmath126 the physical meaning of these prefactors @xmath125 account for the relative increase or decrease of the number of 1d spanning avalanches when changing the aspect ratio . with these definitions ,",
    "the scaling function @xmath3 is thus independent of the aspect ratio @xmath12 and , even more , independent on the nature of the boundary conditions . to observe the collapses corresponding to eq.([eq : escalatuniversaly ] ) for the case of fbc , it is only possible for large enough values of @xmath2 so that the effects caused by the faceted growth of the interfaces become irrelevant .    in future works it would be interesting : a ) to perform the same study for the 3d case and b ) to study the morphological properties of the advancing front and its dynamics for different amounts of disorder .",

    "<S> this work studies universal finite size scaling functions for the number of 1d spanning avalanches in a two - dimensional disordered system with boundary conditions of different nature and different aspect ratios . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the 2d random field ising model at @xmath0 driven by the external field @xmath1 with athermal dynamics implemented with periodic and forced boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we choose a convenient scaling variable @xmath2 that accounts for the deformation of the distance to the critical point caused by the aspect ratio . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , assuming that the dependence of the finite size scaling functions on the aspect ratio can be accounted by an additional multiplicative factor , we have been able to collapse data for different system sizes , different aspect ratios and different nature of the boundary conditions into a single scaling function @xmath3 . </S>"
