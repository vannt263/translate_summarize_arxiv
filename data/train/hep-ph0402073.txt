    "the @xmath8 are the gell - mann ( flavor ) matrices and @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the unit matrix .",
    "the fourth term is the t hooft interaction and @xmath11 represents the model of confinement used in our studies of meson properties .    in the study of hadronic current correlators",
    "it is important to use a model which respects chiral symmetry , when @xmath12 .",

    "therefore , we do not provide a value for the screening mass @xmath40 which is defined when assuming exponential behavior of the correlator .",
    "for the study of charmonium on the lattice , values found for the screening mass are given in ref .",
    "recent theoretical work concerning the quark - gluon plasma has been discussed by shuryak [ 15 ] .",
    "he notes that the physics of excited matter produced in heavy ion collision in the region @xmath41 is different from that of a weakly coupled quark - gluon plasma .",
    "that is due to the strong coupling generated by the bound states of the quasiparticles .",
    "these bound states appear as resonant structures when the imaginary parts of the hadronic correlators are extracted from lattice data using the maximum entropy method ( mem ) [ 4 - 9 ] .",
    "these resonances lead to very strong interactions between the quasiparticles and are , in part , responsible for very small mean free paths and collective flow in heavy - ion collisions . that flow may be described by hydrodynamics .",
    "indeed , shuryak suggests that  ... if the system is macroscopically large , then its description via _ thermodynamics _ of its bulk properties ( like matter composition ) and _ hydrodynamics _ for space - time evolution should work \" [ 15 ] .    in our present work",
    "we have presented a simple chiral model that is able to reproduce the resonances extracted from the lattice data via the mem procedure .",
    "we have calculated the imaginary parts of the vector correlator for various values of the total external momentum @xmath42 .",
    "we have also calculated the correlation function , @xmath30 , and do not find the simple exponential behavior @xmath39 $ ] usually assumed for that correlator . in the special case in which the correlator is dominated by a simple delta function for small @xmath43 , we may define @xmath40 and see that the screening and pole masses are equal [ 10 ] . )      for ease of reference , we present a discussion of our calculation of hadronic current correlators taken from ref.[3 ] .",
    "the procedure we adopt is based upon the real - time finite - temperature formalism , in which the imaginary part of the polarization function may be calculated .",
    "then , the real part of the function is obtained using a dispersion relation .",
    "the result we need for this work has been already given in the work of kobes and semenoff [ 16 ] .",
    "( in ref.[16 ] the quark momentum is @xmath44 and the antiquark momentum is @xmath45 .",
    "we will adopt that notation in this section for ease of reference to the results presented in ref.[16 ] . ) with reference to eq.(5.4 ) of ref.[16 ] , we write the imaginary part of the scalar polarization function as j_s(__p__^2 , t)=12n_c_s(__p__^0)ke^-k^2/^2 ( ) + \\{[1-n_1(k)-n_2(k ) ] ( _ _ p__^0-e_1(k)-e_2(k ) ) + -[n_1(k)-n_2(k ) ] ( _ _ p__^0+e_1(k)-e_2(k ) ) + -[n_2(k)-n_1(k ) ] ( _ _ p__^0-e_1(k)+e_2(k ) ) + -[1-n_1(k)-n_2(k ) ] ( _ _ p__^0+e_1(k)+e_2(k))}.here , @xmath46^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "relative to eq.(5.4 ) of ref.[16 ] , we have changed the sign , removed a factor of @xmath47 and have included a statistical factor of @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , we have included a gaussian regulator , @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "the value @xmath50 gev was used in our applications of the njl model in the calculation of meson properties at @xmath4 .",
    "we also note that n_1(k)=1e^e_1(k)+1,and n_2(k)=1e^e_2(k)+1.for the calculation of the imaginary part of the polarization function , we may put @xmath51 and @xmath52 , since in that calculation the quark and antiquark are on - mass - shell . in eq.(a1 )",
    "the factor @xmath53 arises from a trace involving dirac matrices , such that _ s&=&-[(k+m_1)(k - p+m_2 ) ] + & = & 2p^2 - 2(m_1+m_2)^2,where @xmath54 and @xmath55 depend upon temperature . in the frame where @xmath56 , and in the case @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 . for the scalar case , with @xmath57 , we find j_s(p^2 , t)=(1-)^3/2 e^-k^2/^2[1 - 2n_1(k)],where k^2=4-m^2(t ) .    for pseudoscalar mesons ,",
    "we replace @xmath53 by _ p&=&-[i_5(k+m_1)i_5(k - p+m_2 ) ] + & = & 2p^2 - 2(m_1-m_2)^2,which for @xmath57 is @xmath59 in the frame where @xmath56 .",
    "we find , for the @xmath60 mesons , j_p(p^2,t)=(1-)^1/2 e^-k^2/^2[1 - 2n_1(k)],where @xmath61 , as above .",
    "thus , we see that the phase space factor has an exponent of 1/2 corresponding to a _ s_-wave amplitude . for the scalars ,",
    "the exponent of the phase - space factor is 3/2 , as seen in eq.(a6 ) .    for a study of vector mesons",
    "we consider _ ^v=[_(k+m_1)_(k - p+m_2)],and calculate g^_^v=4[p^2-m_1 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2 + 4m_1m_2],which , in the equal - mass case , is equal to @xmath62 , when @xmath57 and @xmath56 .",
    "this result will be needed when we calculate the correlator of vector currents .",
    "note that , for the elevated temperatures considered in this work , @xmath63 is quite small , so that @xmath64 can be approximated by @xmath65 , when we consider the vector current correlation functions . in that case",
    ", we have j_v(p^2,t ) j_p(p^2,t).at this point it is useful to define functions that do not contain that gaussian regulator : _ p(p^2,t)=(1-)^1/2[1 - 2n_1(k)],and _ v(p^2,t)=(1-)^1/2[1 - 2n_1(k)],for the functions defined in eq.(a14 ) and ( a15 ) we need to use a twice - subtracted dispersion relation to obtain @xmath66 , or @xmath67 .",

    "we may introduce @xmath69 and @xmath70 as complex functions , since we now have both the real and imaginary parts of these functions .",
    "we note that the construction of either @xmath71 , or @xmath72 , by means of a dispersion relation does not require a subtraction .",
    "we use these functions to define the complex functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    in order to make use of eq.(a16 ) , we need to specify @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we found it useful to take @xmath77 2 and to put @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the quantities @xmath80 and @xmath81 are determined in an analogous function .",
    "this procedure in which we fix the behavior of a function such as @xmath82 or @xmath82 is quite analogous to the procedure used in ref.[17 ] . in that work we made use of dispersion relations to construct a continuous vector - isovector current correlation function which had the correct perturbative behavior for large @xmath83 and also described the low - energy resonance present in the correlator due to the excitation of the @xmath84 meson . in ref.[17 ] the njl model was shown to provide a quite satisfactory description of the low - energy resonant behavior of the vector - isovector correlation function .",
    "we now consider the calculation of temperature - dependent hadronic current correlation functions .",
    "the general form of the correlator is a transform of a time - ordered product of currents , ic(p^2 , t)=d^4xe^ipx<>,where the double bracket is a reminder that we are considering the finite temperature case .    for the study of pseudoscalar states",

    "for the study of scalar - isoscalar mesons , we introduce @xmath88 , where @xmath89 for the flavor - singlet current and @xmath90 for the flavor - octet current [ 18 ] .    in the case of the pseudoscalar - isovector mesons ,",
    "the correlator may be expressed in terms of the basic vacuum polarization function of the njl model , @xmath91 [ 18 - 20 ] .",
    "thus , c_p(p^2 , t)=j_p(p^2 , t),where @xmath92 is the coupling constant appropriate for our study of @xmath60 mesons .",
    "we have found @xmath93 by fitting the pion mass in a calculation made at @xmath4 , with @xmath94 gev .",
    "the result given in eq.(a18 ) is only expected to be useful for small @xmath95 , since the gaussian regulator strongly modifies the large @xmath95 behavior .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the following form is useful , if we are to consider the larger values of @xmath95 .",
    "= .(as usual , we put @xmath96 . )",
    "this form has two important features . at large @xmath97",
    ", @xmath98 is a constant , since @xmath99 is proportional to @xmath97 .",
    "further , the denominator of eq.(a19 ) goes to 1 for large @xmath97 . on the other hand , at small @xmath97 ,",
    "the denominator is capable of describing resonant enhancement of the correlation function .",
    "as we have seen , the results obtained when eq.(a19 ) is used appear quite satisfactory .",
    "( we may again refer to ref.[17 ] , in which a similar approximation is described . )    for a study of the vector - isovector correlators , we introduce conserved vector currents @xmath100 with i=1 , 2 and 3 . in this case",
