    "the theoretical and experimental study of decoherence @xcite is important for  at least  two reasons . on the one hand to understand the emergence of classicality in the quantum framework . on the other hand , to assess and minimize the restrictions it imposes the development in new technologies being developed related to quantum information theory .",
    "decoherence appears as the result of uncontrollable ( and unavoidable ) interaction between a quantum system and its environment .",
    "the expected effect is an exponential decay of quantum interference .",
    "generally the theoretical approach is by means of a theory of open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "the idea is to precisely divide the total system into system - of - interest plus environment and then discard the environment variables and derive en effective dynamical equation for the reduced system state .",
    "obtaining and solving the effective equation is generally a very difficult task , so approximations are usually made .",
    "the born - markov approximation , which among other things assumes weak system - environment coupling and vanishing correlation times in the environment yields a markov  memory - less  process , described by a semigroup of completely positive maps .",
    "the generator of these maps is given by the lindblad - gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan master equation @xcite .",
    "lately , though , interest in problems where the markov approximation is no longer valid have flourished ( see  @xcite , to name just a few ) .",
    "one very interesting feature of non - markovian evolution is that information backflow can bring back coherence to the physical system and sometimes even preserve it @xcite .",
    "being able to quantify the deviation of markovianity ( beyond a yes / no answer ) is of importance to compare theory and experiment , specially in circumstances where the usual approximations ( for example infinite size environment and weak coupling ) start to break up .",
    "this leads to a proper understanding and the possibility to engineer non - markovian quantum open systems which has many potential applications like quantum simulators",
    "@xcite , efficient control of entanglement @xcite and entanglement engineering @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite , or dissipation driven quantum information@xcite , and even quantum coherence in biological systems @xcite .",
    "the simulation of non - markovian dynamics and the transition from markovian to non - markovian has been recently reported in experiments  @xcite .",
    "there has been much activity in this context but one basic question remains untouched , namely that of the influence of the underlying classical dynamics of the environment on the central system .",
    "intuition indicates that a chaotic environment should result in markovian dynamics and a regular ( or integrable ) environment in strong non - markovian effects . in  @xcite this transition has been studied .",
    "however , understanding the case where the environment has associated classical dynamics consisting of a mixture of regular islands , broken tori and hyperbolic dynamics , is still an open problem .",
    "the importance of this case is not to be overlooked being that mixed systems are the rule rather than the exception  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is then to shed some light on the relation between the classical dynamics of the environment and its markovianity , for environments where the transition from regular to chaotic is tunable by a parameter .",
    "the complexities of such systems make analytical treatment almost impossible so we shall mainly focus on numerical simulations . in order to have access to some analytic results",
    "the central system will be the simplest possible .",
    "we center on a system consisting on a qubit coupled with an environment in a pure dephasing fashion .",
    "in such a way that the environment evolution is conditioned by the state of the qubit @xcite . the qubit acts as a probe that can be used to extract important information from the dynamics of the environment @xcite . as environment",
    "we use paradigmatic examples of quantum chaos : quantum maps on the torus .",
    "in particular we focus kicked maps which by changing one parameter one can go from integrable to chaotic .    to quantify non - markovianity we use the measure proposed in @xcite which is based on the idea of information flow , from and to the system . in our model",
    "this measure is directly related to the fidelity fluctuations of the environment .",
    "the time dependence of fidelity fluctuations can be used to extract important information about the dynamics of quantum chaotic systems , like the lyapunov exponent @xcite . for localized initial states the fidelity decay and fluctuations can be extremely state - dependent @xcite .",
    "we found that the transition from integrable (  non - markovian \" ) to chaotic (  markovian \" ) is not uniform .",
    "in the transition there is a maximum which can be larger than the value that this measure attains for the regular dynamics . but more importantly , that the maximum happens at a value of the parameter that is critical in the corresponding classical dynamics , like the breakup of the last irrational torus , and the onset of unbound diffusion .",
    "we show that the non - markovian measure used reproduces the intricate structure of the classical phase space with extraordinary precision .",
    "moreover , we observe that the values of non - markovian measure as a function of position in phase space are enhanced in the regions that are neither chaotic nor regular , i.e. at the borders between chaos and regularity .",
    "this establishes the non - markovianity measure used , which depends on the long time fidelity fluctuations , as pointer to the chaos border .",
    "another way of identifying this border can be found in @xcite . as a consequence , our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the fidelity decay of quantum systems with mixed classical dynamics , which is an open problem of current interest @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the definition and the measure of non - markovianity that we use throughout the paper .",
    "then in sect iii we describe the way that our model environment interacts with the central system which is a qubit .",
    "we explicitly write the dynamical map and show how the non - markovianity measure we chose to use depends on the fidelity of the environment . in sec .",
    "iv we give a brief description of the quantum maps that we use a model environments .",
    "depending on a parameter the corresponding classical dynamics of these maps can go from integrable to chaotic . in sections v and",
    "vi we show numerical results . in sec .",
    "v for the environment in a maximally mixed state . in sec .",
    "vi for the environment initially in a pure state . on average both cases show qualitatively similar results .",
    "in addition in sec . vi we show how the classical phase space structure is obtained when the non - markovianity measure is plotted as a function of the initial state .",
    "we draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "vii and we include an appendix where we explain some technical details of the short time behaviour of the fidelity decay .",
    "the notion of markovian evolution , both classical and quantum is associated with an evolution in which memory effects are negligible . in classical mechanics",
    "this is well defined in terms of multiple - point probability distributions . in quantum mechanics evolution of an open system",
    "is often assumed to be well described by a lindblad master equation ( which can also be credited to gorini , kossakowski and sudarshan @xcite ) .",
    "the lindblad master equation generates a one parameter family of completely positive , trace preserving ( cpt ) dynamical maps , also called quantum dynamical semigroup .",
    "the semigroup property implies lack of memory .",
    "but the validity of the lindblad master equation description relies heavily on the born - markov approximation , and other restrictions .",
    "unfortunately there are many cases in which these approximations do not apply , especially when weak coupling is no longer valid , but also in the case of finite environments .",
    "one of the key issues is to consistently define and quantify non - markovian behaviour for quantum open systems .",
    "recently there have been some attempts to define and quantify non - markovianity ( some of them are reviewed in  @xcite ) .",
    "one of these attempts is based on the fact that markovian systems contract , with respect to the distance induced by the norm-1 , the probability space  @xcite .",
    "this is often interpreted as an information leak from the system into an environment , as one decreases with time the ability to infer the initial condition from the state at a given time .",
    "the very same idea has been used in quantum systems .",
    "distinguishability between quantum states is quantified with the trace norm  @xcite , and whenever this quantity increases with time is interpreted as a measure of non - markovian beahvior in the quantum system by breuer , laine and piilo ( blp ) in  @xcite .",
    "as this quantity is related to an information flow , and is simple in our case to calculate , we are going to use it to quantify non - markovianity .",
    "the first step is to define a way to distinguish two states .",
    "we do that by means of the trace distance .",
    "given two arbitrary states represented by their density matrices @xmath0 and @xmath1 the trace distance is defined by @xmath2 it is a well defined distance measure with all the desired properties and it can be shown to be a good measure of distinguishability @xcite .",
    "another property of the trace distance is that @xmath3 i.e. it is invariant under unitary transformations and is a contraction @xmath4 for any cpt quantum channel @xmath5 . thus no cpt quantum operation can increase distinguishability between quantum states .",
    "the idea proposed by blp is that under markovian dynamics the information flows in one direction ( from system to environment ) and two initial states become increasingly indistinguishable .",
    "information flowing back to the system would allow for memory effects to manifest .",
    "a process is then defined to be non - markovian if at a certain time the distance between to states increases , or @xmath6 with this in mind non - markovian behaviour can be quantified by @xcite @xmath7 i.e. the measure of the total increase of distinguishability over time .",
    "the maximum is taken over all possible pairs of initial states .",
    "we should remark here that there are many other proposed measures .",
    "rivas , huelga and plenio ( rhp ) @xcite proposed two measures which are based on the evolution of entanglement to an ancilla , under trace preserving completely positive maps .",
    "there are others based on fisher information @xcite or the validity of the semigroup property @xcite . for some situations",
    "@xcite blp and rhp are equivalent . in our case , it is easy to see that the rhp measure , which relies on monotonous decay of entanglement in markovian processes , differs from the blp measure by a constant factor .",
    "so in the present work we only consider blp .",
    "we assume that the interaction between the environment and the probe qubit is factorizable , and that it commutes with the internal hamiltonian of the qubit . neglecting the qubit hamiltonian , by selecting the appropriate picture , and choosing a convenient basis ,",
    "one can write the hamiltonian as @xmath8 properly rearranged , one can write the hamiltonian of the form @xmath9 were @xmath10 and @xmath11 act only on the environment and @xmath12 , @xmath13 are projectors onto some orthonormal basis of the qubit @xcite . in this case , the coupling @xmath14 is given by the difference of the hamiltonians of the environment in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) .",
    "this kind of pure dephasing interactions occur spontaneously in several experiments ( for example  @xcite ) , but can also be engineered  @xcite .",

    "this yields a dynamical map for the qubit that we write as @xmath18 which , in the basis of pauli matrices , takes the form @xmath19 & { \\rm im}[f(t)]&0\\\\ 0 & { \\rm im}[f(t ) ] & { \\rm re}[f(t ) ] & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}. \\label{eq : paudepha}\\ ] ] here we have taken conventionally @xmath20 and @xmath21 $ ] . in eq .",

    "when the initial state is pure we will consider a coherent state centered at some point @xmath35 to be defined .",
    "on the other hand , if we have no knowledge or control over the environment , then it will most likely be in a mixed state .",

    ", one can write eq .",
    "( [ eq : us ] ) as @xmath42 so the coupling is provided by the echo operator @xmath43 . in this case , after some time the fidelity fluctuates around some constant value .",
    "this causes a linear growth with time of @xmath44 and @xmath45 ( the slope goes to zero with the size of the hilbert space ) . for this reason we follow the strategy of @xcite and consider @xmath45 and @xmath44 up to some finite time @xmath46",
    "for the numerical simulations we suppose that the dynamics of the environment is given by a quantum map on the torus .",
    "apart from the fact that these maps are the simplest paradigmatic examples of quantum chaotic dynamics , the ones we consider can be very efficiently implemented using fast fourier transform . due to",
    "periodic boundary conditions the hilbert space is discrete and of dimension @xmath47 .",

    "quantum maps can be interpreted as quantum algorithms and vice - versa .",
    "in fact there exist efficient  i.e. better than classical  quantum algorithms for many of the well known quantum maps @xcite , making them interesting testbeds of quantum chaos in experiments using quantum simulators ( e.g. @xcite ) .    here",

    "the relation with the fidelity is key to understanding this effect . for states in the chaotic region",
    "the fidelity decays exponentially and saturates at a value which depends on the size of the chaotic area ( typically proportional of order @xmath49 ) .",
    "the main contribution to non - markovianity for chaotic initial conditions come from small time revivals ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution due to fluctuations around the saturation value grows linearly with time , but with a slope that is inversely proportional to @xmath47 , so in the large @xmath47 limit it can be neglected .",
    "gaussian initial states inside regular islands evolve in time with very small deformation , so the fidelity is expected to decay very slowly and eventually there will be very large ( close to 1 ) revivals .",
    "however the large revivals will be sparse and their contribution to non - markovianity will be small . in the border areas",
    "there is no exponential spreading so the initial decay is be slower , and there is no chaotic region so there is no expected saturation . as a result after a short time decay we observe numerically that there are high frequency fluctuations that contribute strongly to the non- markovianity measure .",

    "a deeper understanding of the behaviour of the non markovianity measure @xmath142 at the border between the chaotic and integrable region would be desirable .",
    "we have observed that in that region , for long times , the wave function is trapped within a relatively small portion of phase space .",
    "we could infer that , for these times , there is going to be a smaller area of phase space available , and the wave function will behave approximately randomly with time .",
    "the smaller phase space available , translates into a smaller effective hilbert space , where the fluctuations will thus be larger . to support this reasoning",
    "we have observed that both the husimi and wigner ( without ghost images @xcite ) functions of states contributing largely to the measure of non - markovianity remain localized inside the sticky area near the kam region  @xcite .",
    "we also tested if the fourier transformation of the fidelity amplitude is compatible with random data ( i.e. has little or no structure ) .",
    "moreover , we looked at the distribution of fidelity amplitude , which if it had gaussian distribution it would be compatible with the inner product of two random state .",
    "however , although we have found that the distribution of the fluctuations of the fidelity amplitude is indeed gaussian for many cases , the fourier transform at the border exhibits some clear peaks meaning that the behaviour is not completely random , so it is not simply a matter of smaller effective hilbert space dimension .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "the results obtained in the previous sections relate nm with some global property of the classical system . for the standard map",
    "there is a critical value @xmath143 of the kicking strength after which the motion in the momentum direction ( when the map is taken in the cylinder ) becomes unbounded .",
    "this value , estimated to be @xmath144 @xcite , corresponds to the breaking of the torus with most irrational winding number .",
    "motion for the kicked harper map on the contrary is different .",

    "motion inside this mesh is chaotic and diffusion is unbounded for all @xmath56 .",
    "although to our knowledge  for the hm there is no critical @xmath56 analog to @xmath143 for the standard map , the peaks in figs .  [ picos2d ] , [ fig : trazas ] , and [ fig : paquetes ] hint that there could exist a similar kind of transition function of @xmath56 . to test this conjecture",
    "we evaluate two different global quantities .",
    "first we take into account diffusion .",
    "considering the map on the whole plane ( i.e. no periodic boundaries ) if diffusion is normal then the spreading , e.g. in momentum , should grow linearly with time ( number of kicks ) .",
    "thus we define @xmath148 where the average is taken over each initial condition . in the @xmath149 limit , @xmath150 if diffusion is bounded .",
    "so , for the sm we expect @xmath151 to be @xmath152 ( or go to 0 with time ) below @xmath143 and start growing for @xmath153",
    ". for the hm we do not know a theoretical value of @xmath57 .",
    "however , the diffusion coefficient @xmath151 depends only on the unperturbed motion .",
    "we therefore propose a measure that depends the distance between perturbed and unperturbed trajectories and that is built to resemble @xmath28 .",
    "we take an initial point @xmath154 an evolve it with the classical map , without periodic boundary conditions , and we measure the distance @xmath155 as a function of ( discrete ) time @xmath46 , with @xmath156 the perturbed trajectories . finally in order to mimic the behaviour of quantum fidelity we take @xmath157\\ ] ] which is equal to 1 for @xmath158 and decays for @xmath159 .",

    "there is a qualitatively similar behaviour to @xmath164 ( on the top row ) where @xmath165 grows with @xmath56 until it reaches a peak at @xmath166 , and then after that it decreases .",
    "we have already hinted that for the sm , this peak is reached for @xmath167 , where the last irrational torus is broken , or when unbounded diffusion sets in .",
    "we know that @xmath90 @xcite .",
    "for the symmetric hm there is both normal and anomalous diffusion , described in @xcite , but there is _ a priori _ no equivalent point to @xmath168 of the sm .    on the bottom row of fig .",

    "the red / solid line corresponds to @xmath170 while the green / dashed line corresponds to @xmath171 .",

    "in particular we centered our attention on the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics . at the extremes ,",
    "i.e. either regular or chaotic the behaviour is as expected : if the environment is chaotic then we expect it to lose memory quicker and be more markovian than an environment corresponding to regular dynamics . at the transition , where classical dynamics is mixed",

    "the peak is located almost exactly at the critical point where the last irrational torus breaks and for dynamics in the cylinder there is unbounded diffusion . for the case of the harper map",
    ", there is no critical point .",
    "however we obtain a peak that is robust to changes in size , time and way of averaging .",
    "we conjecture that it should also correspond to a transition point in the classical dynamics . to support this conjecture we studied the fluctuations of the distance between classical trajectories ( with no periodic boundaries ) .",
    "we found peaks at locations compatible with the results obtained for the non - markovianity measure used .    additionally , by studying the dependence of no - markovianity on the initial state of the environment we first found that the main contributions to average non - markovian behaviour come , not from regular ( integrable ) islands , but from the regions between chaotic and integrable which typically are complex and composed of broken tori.we were able to build classical phase space pictures from the non - markovianity measure , where the borders between chaos and regularity are clearly highlighted .",
    "it is worth remarking that from our numerical investigations yet another feature of quantum fidelity has been unveiled : the long time fluctuations can help identify complex phase space structures like the border between chaotic and regular regions .",
    "traditional ( average ) fidelity decay approaches have the aim of identifying sensitivity to perturbations , and chaos .",
    "the approach presented here , in contrast , can  from the fidelity as a function of each individual initial state  provide a clear image of the classical phase portrait and not just a global quantity from which to infer chaotic ( or regular ) behavior .",
    "we think that our numerics fit well within the scope of recent experimental setups @xcite , and some of our findings could be explored .",
    "finally , we should acknowledge that the validity and interpretation of the quantities used to asses how non- markovian a quantum evolution is ( including the blp measure used here ) , is a subject of ongoing discussion and which remains to be decided .",
    "even the ability of a measure of determining whether a system is markovian is a topic of intense debate .",
    "the blp measure tied to the system studied provided new insight particularly in the relation with the complexities of phase space .",
    "we think that the approach proposed here , i.e. a simple system coupled to a completely known environment with a feature - rich classical phase space , could provide with benchmarking possibilities for non - markovianity measures .",
