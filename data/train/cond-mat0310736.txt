    "layered superconductors , such as high-@xmath5 cuprates ( htsc ) or organic bedt systems , have been a subject of extensive research effort for decades .",
    "these systems show rich novel phenomena , including superconducting fluctuations , pancake vortex , complicated vortex phase diagrams , and interlayer josephson effects .",
    "cuprate superconductors have been investigated extensively as prototypical layered superconductors .",
    "the cuprates have a merit that their carrier concentration can be controlled by chemical substitutions and/or oxygen contents . on the other hand",
    ", it has not been easy to control the interlayer distance in cuprates . in general , superconductivity of these layered systems",
    "is deeply related to in - plane features as well as interlayer couplings . for overall understanding of superconductivity in these systems",
    ", it would be essential to elucidate interplay between in - plane and interplane properties . despite extensive research effort ,",
    "however , detailed roles of dimensionality are yet to be clarified in these systems .",
    "recently , superconductivity was discovered in zrncl and hfncl intercalated with alkali atoms ( li , na , k ) @xcite .",
    "systems based on zrncl have superconducting transition temperatures @xmath11 k , while those based on hfncl have @xmath12 k. these systems can be co - intercalated with organic molecules , such as thf ( tetrahydrofuran ) or pc ( propyrene carbonate ) .",
    "the parent compounds zrncl and hfncl are insulators which have a layered structure as shown in fig .",
    "zr(hf)-n honeycomb double layers are sandwiched by cl layers , and a composite cl-(zrn)-(zrn)-cl layers form a stacking unit .",
    "adjacent stacking units are bonded by weak van der waals force . alkali metal atoms and polar organic molecules such as thf or pc can be co - intercalated into the van der waals gap of the parent compounds as shown schematically in fig .",
    "intercalated alkali metal atoms are supposed to release electrons into zr(hf)-n double layers , which makes the system metallic and superconducting . on the other hand ,",
    "intercalated organic molecules expand interlayer distance without changing zr(hf)-n honeycomb double layers .",
    "so we can control two separate parameters , carrier concentration and the stacking unit distance , in a single series of nitride chlorides with the common superconducting slab .",
    "this unique feature could allow studies of layered superconductors from a new angle .    in this paper",
    ", we will present synthesis and characterization of a series of intercalated zrncl and hfncl samples , together with studies of their superconducting properties using muon spin relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) , magnetization , and resistivity measurements .",
    "a part of this work was presented in a conference @xcite , where we reported @xmath0sr results in hfncl - li@xmath13-thf@xmath14 , showed that @xmath5 and the 2-d superfluid density in this system follow the correlations found in cuprates and bedt systems , and discussed that this feature likely comes from departure from bcs condensation , which can be understood in terms of crossover from bose - einstein to bcs condensation .",
    "subsequently , tou _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reported an nmr knight shift study which inferred a rather small density of states at the fermi level in hfncl - li - thf , and discussed difficulty in explaining the high transition temperature @xmath5 in terms of the conventional bcs theory .",
    "_ @xcite also reported a rather high upper critical field @xmath15 kg , for the field applied perpendicular to the conducting planes , from magnetization and nmr measurements .",
    "extensive @xmath0sr measurements of the magnetic field penetration depth @xmath8 have been performed to date in various superconducting systems , such as high-@xmath5 cuprates ( htsc ) @xcite , fullerides @xcite , and two - dimensional ( 2-d ) organic bedt systems @xcite .",
    "universal nearly linear correlations have been found between @xmath5 and the muon spin relaxation rate @xmath16 ( superconducting carrier density / effective mass ) in the underdoped region of many htsc systems and in some other exotic superconductors @xcite such correlations are seen also in htsc superconductors having extra perturbations , such as overdoping @xcite , ( cu , zn ) substitutions @xcite , or spontaneous formation of nano - scale regions with static stripe spin correlations @xcite . in all these systems ,",
    "@xmath5 follows the correlations with superfluid density found for less perturbed standard htsc systems .",
    "these results indicate that the superfluid density is a determining factor for @xmath5 in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "in general , a strong dependence of @xmath5 on the carrier density is not expected in conventional bcs theory@xcite where @xmath5 is determined by the mediating boson ( phonon ) energy scale and the density of states of carriers at the fermi level which govern the charge - boson ( electron - phonon ) coupling . for 2-d metals ,",
    "the density of states does not depend on the carrier density in the simplest case of non - interacting fermion gas .",
    "therefore , the bcs theory has a fundamental difficulty in explaining the observed correlations .",
    "in contrast , an explicit dependence of @xmath5 can be expected for the condensation temperature @xmath17 in bose - einstein ( be ) condensation of a simple bose gas , as well as for the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath18 for a 2-d superfluid @xcite . in",
    "be and kt transitions , the transition temperature is determined simply by the number density and the mass , since the condensation is decoupled from the formation of condensing bosons in these two cases .",
    "the universality of the @xmath5 vs @xmath2 relationship observed beyond the difference of systems , such as cuprates , fullerides , orangics , etc .",
    ", may be related to this feature .",
    "pictures proposed to explain the correlations between @xmath5 and the superfluid density in the cuprates include crossover from bose - einstein to bcs condensation @xcite and phase fluctuations @xcite . in the present work , we extend our study to intercalated nitride - chloride systems , seeking further insights into such phenomenology .",
    "we have also determined the upper critical field @xmath7 of nitride - chloride systems from magnetization and resistivity measurements . although it is not easy to determine @xmath7 in layered superconductors due to the strong superconducting fluctuations , hao _",
    "@xcite developed an approach to overcome such difficulty using a model for reversible diamagnetic magnetization of type - ii superconductors which have high @xmath19 values .",
    "here , @xmath19 is the ginzburg - landau parameter defined as the ratio of the penetration depth @xmath8 to the coherence length @xmath20 . in this model , one calculates the free energy including the supercurrent kinetic energy , the magnetic - field energy , as well as the kinetic - energy and condensation - energy terms arising from suppression of the order parameter in the vortex core .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to various high-@xmath5 cuprate superconductors .",
    "we will apply this model to superconducting hf(zr)ncl in the temperature and field region where the effect of superconducting fluctuations is negligible .",
    "the parent compounds hfncl and zrncl were synthesized by the reaction of zr or hf powder with vaporized nh@xmath21cl at 600  @xmath22c for 30 minutes in n@xmath23 flow @xcite .",
    "the resulting powder was sealed in a quartz ampule and was purified by a chemical vapor transport method with temperature gradient @xcite . for the purification , an end of the ampule with pre - reacted powder was kept at 800  @xmath22c and the other end , where purified powder is collected , at 900  @xmath22c for three days .",
    "no impurity phase was detected in the purified powder from x - ray diffraction .",
    "since a li - intercalated sample is sensitive to air , intercalation was performed in a glove box .",
    "we used three intercalation methods @xcite to prepare a variety of samples : ( i ) li - intercalated zrncl samples were prepared by soaking parent zrncl powder in three kinds of butyllithium solution .",
    "we used 2.0 @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) @xmath26-butyllithium solution in cyclohexane , 1.3 @xmath24 @xmath27-butyllithium solution in cyclohexane , and 1.7@xmath24 @xmath28-butyllithium solution in pentane for this purpose . in this order",
    ", reducing ability becomes stronger and therefore higher concentration of li atoms can be intercalated into the parent compound .",
    "we used solution which contained butyllithium corresponding to more than 2 , 5 , and 5 equivalents of zrncl for @xmath26- , @xmath27- , and @xmath28-butyllithium , to avoid the dilution of butyllithium in the intercalation process .",
    "( ii ) we performed co - intercalation of li and organic molecules into zrncl by soaking li intercalated zrncl powder ( prepared by the method ( i ) using @xmath26-butyllithium solution ) in enough thf or pc .",
    "( iii ) li- and thf - co - intercalated hfncl samples were prepared by soaking hfncl powder in various concentrations ( 2.5 - 100 @xmath29 ) of lithium naphthalene ( li - naph ) solution in thf . since phase separation",
    "was often observed in the samples prepared by the method ( iii ) , we selected single phase samples for the measurements in this study via characterization from @xmath5 as well as c - axis lattice constant .",
    "the li- and thf - co - intercalated hfncl sample with the largest c - axis lattice constant according to the method ( iii ) was prepared at hiroshima university , while all the other samples at columbia university .",
    "table 1 shows a list of these samples .",
    "the chemical composition was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy ( icp - aem ) and chn elemental analysis .",
    "the powder samples were pressed into pellets under uniaxial stress and sealed in cells made of kapton film and epoxy glue for x - ray measurements .",
    "the x - ray rocking curve of @xmath30 peaks for cleaved surface ( inside of a pellet ) shows a peak with half width at half maximum of @xmath31 8 degrees , which indicates that the bulk of the samples have well - aligned preferred orientation and are suitable for studies of anisotropic properties .",
    "essentially similar rocking curves were also observed for as - prepared surfaces of pellets .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature of the samples was determined from measurements of magnetic susceptibility @xmath32 . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the results of @xmath32 in intercalated zrncl specimens which were examined by @xmath0sr measurements .",
    "the values of @xmath33 are of the order for ideal perfect diamagnetism @xmath34 for spherical samples and @xmath35 for long cylindrical samples with the field parallel to the cylinder axis . the determination of the absolute values of @xmath32 , however , can be affected by such factors as non - spherical sample shape , sample morphology and residual field in a squid magnetometer .",
    "these factors might have caused deviation of some of the zero - field cooled shielding values of @xmath32 from @xmath35 .    in table 1 , we summarize the composition , synthesis method , distance between adjacent stacking units ( 1/3 of the c - axis lattice constant @xmath36 , see fig .",
    "1 ) , and the superconducting transition temperature @xmath5 for these samples .",
    "the stacking unit distance is 9.4   for the li - intercalated samples prepared by the method ( i ) without co - intercalation of organic molecules .",
    "this value is almost the same as that for unintercalated parent compound ( 9.3  ) without li .",
    "with increasing li concentration @xmath6 from 0.17 to 0.6 ( in the samples without co - intercalation of organic molecules ) , @xmath5 decreases from 14.2 k to 11.7 k. figure 3(a ) shows the @xmath6 dependence of @xmath5 in li@xmath1zrncl and li@xmath1hfncl samples , with / without co - intercalation , obtained in the present study . in fig . 3 and table 1",
    ", we find that : ( 1 ) @xmath5 shows a slow reduction with increasing @xmath6 ; ( 2 ) for close @xmath6 values , @xmath5 does not depend much on the stacking - unit distance @xmath37/3 ( see fig .",
    "3(b ) ) . these results are qualitatively consistent with the reported results in the li , k , and na doped zrncl samples with / without co - intercalation of organic molecules @xcite .",
    "decrease of @xmath5 with increasing charge doping is reminiscent of the case of overdoped high-@xmath5 cuprate superconductors .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first report of success in li - thf intercalation into zrncl by @xmath27- and @xmath28-butyllithium .",
    "the stacking unit thickness is 13.3 or 18.7   for the methods ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "as has been reported , @xmath5 is almost unaffected by the expansion of the stacking - unit distance from @xmath31 9.4   to @xmath31 13.3    for the samples with li content @xmath38 ( see fig .  2 ( b ) ) .",
    "systems based on hfncl has @xmath5 = 25.5 k , nearly a factor of two higher than that for intercalated zrncl .",
    "our @xmath0sr experiments were performed at triumf , the canadian national accelerator laboratory located in vancouver , canada , which provided a high intensity and polarized beam of positive muons .",
    "each pressed pellet sample , with the c - axis aligned , was sealed in a sample cell which has a kapton window and mounted in a he gas - flow cryostat with the c - axis parallel to the direction of muon beam .",
    "transverse external field ( tf ) was applied parallel to the beam direction , while muons are injected with their initial spin polarization perpendicular to the field / beam direction .",
    "low - momuntum ( surface ) muons with the incident momentum of 29.8 mev / c were implanted in the pellet specimens .",
    "the average stopping depth , 100 - 200 mg/@xmath39 , assured that the majority of muons are stopped within the specimen , after going through kapton windows of the cryostat and the sample cell .",
    "plastic sintillation counters were used to detect the arrival of a positive muon and its decay into a positron , and the decay - event histogram was obtained , as a function of muon residence time @xmath40 which corresponds to the time difference of the muon arrival and positron decay signals .",
    "the time evolution of muon spin direction / polarization was obtained from the angular asymmetry of positron histograms , after correction for the exponential decay @xmath41 , where @xmath42 = 2.2 @xmath0s is the mean lifetime of a positive muon .",
    "details of @xmath0sr technique can be found , for example , in refs @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry time spectra @xmath43 were fit to a functional form ; @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the initial decay asymmetry at @xmath40 = 0 .",
    "the muon spin precesses at the frequencies @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the gyromagnetic ratio of a muon ( @xmath48 mhz / kg ) and @xmath49 denotes the transverse external magnetic field . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , for an example of li@xmath50zrncl , this oscillation exhibits faster damping in the superconducting state due to inhomogeneous distribution of internal magnetic fields in the flux vortex structure . in pressed pellet samples of random or oriented powder",
    ", this relaxation can usually be approximated by a gaussian decay which defines the muon spin relaxation rate @xmath51 .    for systems except for zrncl - li - thf",
    ", the @xmath0sr results were analysed by assuming a single - component signal , which shows a reasonble agreement to the data as in fig .",
    "4(b ) . in zrncl co -",
    "intercalated with li and thf , the relative value of the shielding susceptibility was significantly lower than those of other samples , as shown in fig .",
    "although it is not clear , this reduced susceptibility could possibly imply a finite fraction of superconducting volume . as a precautionary measure , by fitting selected low - temperature signals in field - cooled and zero - field cooled procedures to an asymmetry function having two - component signals",
    ", we estimated an upper - limit of the relaxation rate for the superconducting fraction .",
    "this upper - limit is shown ( in figs . 6 and 7 ) by the error - bar placed to the right side of the main point for @xmath51 which was obtained for a single - component asymmetry function .",
    "figure 4 shows time spectra of muon decay asymmetry for a representative sample above and below @xmath5 . in the normal state above @xmath5",
    ", the oscillation shows a small relaxation due to nuclear dipole fields .",
    "we denote this relaxation rate as @xmath52 . below @xmath5 ,",
    "the relaxation becomes faster due to additionaal field distribution from the flux vortex lattice .",
    "for each specimen , the zero - field @xmath0sr spectra obtained above and well below @xmath10 did not show any difference .",
    "this assures that the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate observed in tf is due to superconductivity alone , and also implies that there is no detectable effect of time - reversal symmetry breaking , contrary to the case of upt@xmath53 @xcite and sr@xmath54ruo@xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the effect of the superconducting vortex lattice can be obtained by subtracting this normal - state background @xmath52 from the observed relaxation rate @xmath56 . since the nuclear dipolar broadening and superconducting broadening of the internal fields do not add coherently , here we adopt quadratic subtraction to obtain the relaxation rate @xmath51 due to superconductivity as : @xmath57 and @xmath58 note that this procedure makes the error bar rather large around @xmath51 = 0 .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate @xmath51 for the samples co - intercalated with organic molecules having expanded interlayer distance . with decreasing temperature",
    ", the relaxation rate begins to increase below the superconducting transition temperature @xmath5 . at the flux - pinning temperature @xmath59 ,",
    "the zero - field - cooling ( zfc ) curve begins to deviate from the field - cooling ( fc ) curve . in the zfc procedures ,",
    "flux vortices are required to enter the specimen from its edge and move a large distance before reaching their equilibrium position . below the pinning temperature @xmath59",
    ", this long - distance flux motion could be prevented by the flux pinning , resulting in an highly inequilibrium flux lattice and more inhomogeneous field distribution at muon sites .",
    "this behavior has been observed in earlier @xmath0sr studies of htsc @xcite , bedt @xcite and some other systems . in both systems shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) , we find that @xmath59 is much lower than @xmath5 , which is a characteristic feature for highly 2-d superconductors .",
    "the @xmath0sr results of @xmath59 for the present systems agree well with those from magnetization measurements discussed in section vii .",
    "we performed fc measurements using a wide range of external transverse magnetic fields @xmath49 , and found no significant dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath49 from 40 g to 1000 g , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . in tf-@xmath0sr measurements in highly 2-d superconductors , such as bi2212 or ( bedt - ttf)@xmath23cu(ncs)@xmath23 , application of a high external magnetic field transforms 3-d flux vortex structure into 2-d pancake vortices , since higher field implies stronger coupling of flux vortices within a given plane and higher chance for the vortex location in each plane to be determined by random defect position on each plane @xcite .",
    "the absence of field dependence in our measurements implies that corrections for the 2-d vortex effect is not necessary in the present study .",
    "this situation is expected for our c - axis aligned powder specimens .",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath60 shows a tendency of saturation at low temepratures in all of the measured samples of nitride - chloride systems in the present study .",
    "this behavior is characteristic for s - wave superconductors .",
    "however , experiments using high - quality single crystals are required for a conclusive determination of the superconducting pairing symmetry . in the case of htsc cuprates ,",
    "d - wave pairing was established only after @xmath0sr results on high - quality crystals of yba@xmath23cu@xmath61o@xmath62 became available @xcite .",
    "figure 5(b ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath51 for the samples without organic co - intercalant .",
    "the dependence of @xmath51 on temperature @xmath63 and field @xmath49 of the field - cooling results was essentially similar to that for specimens with co - intercalation in fig .",
    "5(a ) . in these systems",
    ", we determined the pinning temperature @xmath59 by magnetization measurements instead of by @xmath0sr , and show the results in section vii .",
    "the @xmath0sr relaxation rate due to the penetration depth is related to the superconducting carrier density @xmath64 , effective mass @xmath65 , the coherence length @xmath20 and the mean free path @xmath66 as @xmath67 the proportionality to @xmath2 comes from the fact that this effect is caused by the superconducting screening current , and consequently reflecting the current density in a similar way to the normal state conductivity of a metal which is proportional to the carrier density divided by the effective mass . as will be shown later , @xmath20 is estimated to be 80 - 90   in the present nitride - chloride systems .",
    "the mean free path can not be determined at the moment , since a high - quality single crystal is not yet available .",
    "in this situation , we proceed with the following arguments by assuming that the system falls in the clean limit ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "clean limit has been confirmed in many other strongly type - ii superconductors , such as the cuprates and bedt systems .    in highly anisotropic 2-d superconductors ,",
    "the penetration depth measured with the external field parallel and perpenducular to the conducting plane could be very different .",
    "for the geomentry with @xmath49 perpendicular to the conducting plane , related to the in - plane penetration depth @xmath4 as in the present study , the superconducting screening current flows within the plane , resulting in the more effective partial screening of @xmath49 and the shorter @xmath8 compared to the case with @xmath49 parallel to the planes . in the present work , our specimen has a highly - oriented c - axis direction within + /-",
    "8 degrees , and we regard our specimen as equivalent to single crystal specimens in terms of anisotropy .",
    "a theory / simulation work @xcite shows that for un - oriented ceramic specimens of highly 2-d superconductors , value of @xmath51 should be reduced by a factor of 1/1.4 from the value for single crystals observed with @xmath49 applied perpenducular to the conducting planes .    in fig .",
    "6 , in a plot of @xmath5 versus the low - temperature relaxation rate @xmath69 , we compare the results of the present nitride - chloride systems with those from cuprate and organic bedt superconductors .",
    "the point for the bedt system was obtained in @xmath0sr measurements using single crystal specimens @xcite .",
    "the shaded area denoted as cuprates represents the universal linear correlations found for un - oriented ceramic specimens of underdoped ybco systems : we multiplied the relaxation rate in these ybco by a factor of 1.4 to account for the difference between single crystal and un - oriented ceramic specimens .",
    "the data points lie in possibly two different groups having different slopes in the @xmath5/@xmath51 relation .",
    "the first group with a higher slope includes the present nitride - chloride systems with co - intercalation of organic molecules and the bedt system , all of which having highly 2-d character as demonstrated by their depinning temperature @xmath59 being nearly a 1/3 to 1/2 of @xmath5 .",
    "the second group includes ybco cuprates and nitride - chloride systems without organic co - intercalation , all of which have more 3 dimensional ( 3-d ) character in the flux pinning property with @xmath59 closer to @xmath5 .",
    "the irreversibility and depinning behavior in li@xmath1zrncl without organic co - intercalation was studied not by @xmath0sr but by magnetization measurements as described in section vii .",
    "the relaxation rate observed by @xmath0sr is determined by the 3-d superfluid density @xmath2 , as this is a phenomenon caused by the screening supercurrent density in bulk specimens . with the knowledge of interlayer spacing @xmath70",
    ", one can convert 3-d density @xmath2 into 2-d density on each conducting plane as @xmath71 . for systems having double - layer conducting planes , such as the present nitride chlorides or some family of the cuprates ,",
    "the average interlayer spacing depends on whether or not the double layer is regarded as a single conducting unit or two . in our previous reports for cuprates",
    "@xcite , we treated the double layer as two single layers .",
    "we shall follow this approach here , and define the @xmath70 to be a half of the stacking unit distance as @xmath72 .    in fig .",
    "7 , we show a plot of @xmath5 versus the 2-d superefluid density @xmath73 represented by the value @xmath74 .",
    "we include a point obtained in c - axis oriented ceramic specimen of yba@xmath23cu@xmath61o@xmath75 @xcite ( without multiplying a factor 1.4 to @xmath51 since this specimen had an almost perfect alignment of c - axis direction ) .",
    "we find that most of the data points share a unique slope in fig .",
    "7 . this result suggests two features : ( 1 ) within the nitride - chloride systems , 2-d superfluid density @xmath73 is a determining factor for @xmath5 ; and ( 2 ) the 2-d superfluid density may even be a fundamental determining factor for @xmath5 among different superconducting systems .",
    "however , the second conclusion ( 2 ) must be taken with caution , because , this analysis depends on our treatment regarding single versus double layers , and also because recent data on tl2201 @xcite . and",
    "bi2201 @xcite cuprates , having very large interlayer distance @xmath7612  , show universal behavior with the results from ybco ( @xmath77 6  ) only in a 3-d plot like fig . 6 but not in a 2-d plot like fig . 7 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the conclusion ( 1 ) is more robust , since all the nitride - chloride systems have double conducting layers , and since the predominant 2-d character is consistent with the absence of dependence of @xmath5 on interlayer spacing in nitride - chlorides shown in fig .",
    "since the fermi energy of a 2-d metal is proportional to the 2-d carrier density @xmath78 divided by the in - plane effective mass @xmath79 , as @xmath80 , the horizontal axis of fig .",
    "7 can be converted into an energy scale representing superconducting condensate .",
    "this conversion from penetration depth to the superfluid energy scale was first attempted by uemura _",
    "_ @xcite in 1991 and later followed by other researchers , including emery and kivelson @xcite .",
    "in order to do such a conversion , one needs to obtain absolute values of the penetration depth @xmath8 from the relaxation rate @xmath51 .",
    "the numerical factor in this @xmath51 to @xmath8 conversion in @xmath81 depends on models used for analyses of relaxation function line shapes , fitting range of data analyses , treatment of single crystal versus ceramic samples , and some other factors .",
    "the gaussian decay , which fits most of the data from ceramic samples quite well , is significantly different from the ideal field distribution @xmath82 expected for a perfect abrikosov vortex lattice in triangular lattice .",
    "so , using a theoretical second moment for @xmath82 in abrikosov lattice is not necessarily appropriate for data analyses in real experiments .",
    "after various simulations and consistency checks , we decided to adopt a factor which gives @xmath8 = 2,700   for @xmath51 = 1 @xmath0s@xmath83 for a triangular lattice . note",
    "that this conversion is for a standard triangular lattice , contrary to the statements of tou and collabrators @xcite who have erroneously cited that we calculated @xmath8 for a square vortex lattice .",
    "then we can derive @xmath73 from the observed values of @xmath51 and known values of @xmath70 . in the horizontal axis of fig .",
    "7 , we attach the 2-d fermi temperature @xmath84 corresponding to the 2-d superfluid density obtained in the above - mentioned procedure .    a 2-d superfluid of bose gas , such as thin films of liquid he , undergoes superfluid to normal transition via a thermal excitation of unbound flux vortices , as shown by kosterlitz and thouless ( kt ) @xcite . for paired fermion systems composed of @xmath26 fermions with mass @xmath85 , forming a superfluid with boson density @xmath86 and mass @xmath87 ,",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless transition temprature @xmath18 becomes 1/8 of the 2-d fermi temperature @xmath84 of the corresponding fermion system . in the kt theory ,",
    "the 2-d superfluid density at the transition temperture @xmath18 should follow system - independent universal behavior : namely , @xmath88 at @xmath89 equals @xmath90 .",
    "this universal relation was first confirmed by an experiment on he thin films @xcite . in systems close to ideal bose - gas",
    ", the 2-d superfluid density shows almost no reduction between @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "thus , in such a case , we would expect the points in fig . 7 ( based on @xmath93 ) to lie on the @xmath18 line . in thin films of bcs superconductors ,",
    "the superfluid density shows much reduction from the value of @xmath91 to @xmath94 , and the `` kt jump of superfluid density '' becomes invisible .",
    "this corresponds to the situation where the points in fig .",
    "7 lie far in the right side of the @xmath18 line . in fig",
    ". 7 , most of the points lie about a factor of 2 away from the @xmath18 line .",
    "the linear relation between @xmath5 and @xmath93 suggests relevance to the kt transition , as pointed out by emery and kivelson@xcite .",
    "however , the deviation from the @xmath18 line implies serious difference from the ideal kt situation .",
    "magnetization measurements were performed using a squid magnetometer ( quantum - design ) at columbia .",
    "aligned pressed samples were sealed in quartz ampules .",
    "the raw response curve was corrected by the subtraction of the quartz background curve measured in advance . in the normal state of the superconducting hf(zr)ncl samples , as well as the parent compounds ,",
    "weak - ferromagnetic behavior is observed up to room temperature .",
    "this weak - ferromagnetic behavior changes by the intercalation . therefore , we subtracted the weak - ferromagnetic contribution .",
    "we estimated this by extrapolating temperature dependence , assuming the curie - weiss law ( @xmath95 ) and fitting the normal state magnetization in the temperature range of @xmath96 .",
    "in this temperature range , superconducting fluctuations can be neglected and the temperature dependence is slightly concave .",
    "we only used the data with the extrapolated weak - ferromagnetic contribution smaller than 10 %  of the diamagnetic magnetization , to avoid an error from the assumption of the curie - weiss temperature dependence .",
    "the model developed by hao _",
    "@xcite was applied to the analysis of the reversible region . in this model ,",
    "reduced ( dimensionless ) magnetization @xmath97 and field @xmath98 scales as a single function that contains the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath19 as a unique parameter . in our analysis , we optimized @xmath99 , in addition to @xmath19 as a parameter independent of temperature .",
    "resistivity measurements were performed using a well - aligned pressed sample with four electrodes that is sealed in a cell made of kapton film and epoxy glue .",
    "magnetization measurements were performed in li@xmath50zrncl and li@xmath100thf@xmath101zrncl with magnetic fields applied parallel to the c - axis .",
    "figure 8 shows the results obtained after the corrections for the quartz ample background and for the weak - ferromagnetic contribution .",
    "we note that a crossing point exists in the @xmath102 curve under various magnetic fields for each system , which is characteristic of quasi - two - dimensional superconductors  @xcite .",
    "there are reversible temperature regions where zfc and fc magnetization curves overlap each other . below a certain temperature",
    "( the pinning temperature @xmath59 ) , zfc and fc magnetization curves deviate .",
    "we notice that the reversible region is wider for li@xmath100thf@xmath101zrncl .",
    "this result is consistent with a picture that , by the expansion of the interlayer distance , the interlayer coupling become weaker and the pinning of the vortices becomes less effective .    in the data analyses in the reversible region of li@xmath50zrncl and li@xmath100thf@xmath101zrncl",
    ", we confined to the temperature region apart from @xmath103 in order to avoid ambiguity due to the superconducting fluctuations .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "9 , the data scale quite well to hao s model in the whole reversible temperature range below @xmath5 for the both systems . for all the data , @xmath104 and hence the demagnetization factor can be ignored .",
    "this analysis yielded values of @xmath19 ranging between 50 and 80 ( see table 1 ) , which indicates that these compounds are extreme type - ii superconductors . in fig .",
    "10 , we show the values of the upper critical field @xmath105 obtained down to @xmath106 k in this process using hao s model .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath105 fits well to an empirical formula @xmath107 $ ] , as shown by the dashed lines in fig .",
    "we emphasize that the low temperature limit value @xmath108 can be obtained almost without any extrapolation using this formula : the resulting values are shown in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath109 value of @xmath31 4 - 5 t in zrncl - li - thf system is about a factor of 2 smaller than @xmath110 10 t in hfncl - li - thf system reported by tou _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "these results might indicate that @xmath7 roughly scales with @xmath5 .",
    "a similar nearly linear relation between @xmath7 and @xmath5 can be found in the @xmath7 values for high-@xmath5 cuprate superconductors in the optimum doping region .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath5 obtained using hao s model is 14.9 k for both samples , which agrees with the estimate from the onset of diamagnetism due to superconductivity .",
    "we notice that at @xmath111 kg above @xmath112 , a diamagnetic behavior due to superconducting fluctuation was observed in magnetization as shown in fig .",
    "similar results due to critical fluctuations have been reported in htsc  @xcite and bedt  @xcite systems .",
    "we obtained the in - plane coherence length @xmath113 and the in - plane penetration depth @xmath114 using expressions @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "these results are also summarized in table 1 .",
    "we note that @xmath112 , and @xmath113 are almost unaffected by the interlayer distance .",
    "this agrees with the view that the essence of the superconductivity in hf(zr)ncl is dominated in hf(zr)-n honeycomb double layers .",
    "the values of the penetration depth determined both from @xmath0sr and magnetization show reasonable agreement , although the former is @xmath117 % smaller than the latter for both compounds .    in magentization measurements ( see fig . 8) and @xmath0sr measurements ( see fig .",
    "5(a ) ) , the results become history dependent below a pinning temperature @xmath59 for a given external field @xmath49 .",
    "this feature can be expressed by defining the irreversibility field @xmath118 for a given temperature @xmath63 as @xmath119 .",
    "figure 10 also includes @xmath118 as a function of temperature , determined from magnetization and @xmath0sr measurements .",
    "the results obtained from the two different techniques exhibit excellent agreement .",
    "zrncl superconductors have a quite large reversible region in the @xmath120-@xmath63 plane .",
    "the temperature dependence of the irreversibility field fits well to a functional form @xmath121 , obtained for three - dimensionally fluctuating vortices@xcite , with @xmath122 at low fields below @xmath123 tesla .",
    "this provides support to our assumption of 3-d vortex lines which we adopted in our analyses of tf-@xmath0sr spectra taken below @xmath124 tesla . at higher fields ,",
    "the fitting becomes worse , similarly to ref .",
    "this may be related to a dimensional crossover from 3- to 2-d vortex fluctuations .",
    "more careful measurements are necessary to conclude this point .    in order to provide a cross - check for the results of @xmath125 , we performed magnetoresistance measurements on li@xmath50zrncl .",
    "the temperature dependence of resistivity for two sets of field and current configurations is shown in fig .",
    "high resistivity of the order of 100 @xmath126 and negative slope of the resistivity in the normal state at low temperatures could be due to grain boundaries and may not be intrinsic .",
    "the observed superconducting transition is broadened by superconducting fluctuations , weakly superconducting regions such as grain boundaries , and by vortex motion due to lorenz force .",
    "we notice that the resistive broadening is slightly larger for @xmath127 , which is a natural consequence of significant superconducting fluctuations only for @xmath127 .",
    "we defined @xmath128 where resisitivity shows 50 % drop of the maximum value .",
    "figure 12 shows @xmath125 obtained in this procedure .",
    "these absolute values of @xmath129 for @xmath130 agree reasonably well with those from magnetization measurements , in spite of the unreliable definition due to the broad resistive transition .",
    "the difference between the temperature dependences of the magnetization ( fig .",
    "10 ) and resistive ( fig .",
    "12 ) @xmath7 data may be due the above - mentioned limitations of the resistive measurements .",
    "the anisotropy ratio of the upper critical field @xmath131 is roughly 3 as shown in fig .",
    "although we do not have data for the system with co - intercalation of thf or pc , the anisotropy ratio would presumably increase in more 2-d systems with larger stacking unit distance .",
    "the quasi - two - dimensional nature of the superconducting state appears in various superconducting properties of intercalated hf(zr)ncl . @xmath5",
    "correlates with a 2-d superconducting carrier density @xmath132 devided by effective mass @xmath79 rather than the 3-d counterpart .",
    "diamagnetic magnetization due to superconducting fluctuation for @xmath127 is observed at high temperatures and high fields .",
    "the crossing point exists in @xmath102 curves measured at various fields .",
    "the reversible region of magnetization becomes larger with the increase of interlayer distance , suggesting weaker interlayer coupling .",
    "in addition to these results , we note that @xmath5 , @xmath73 , and @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) , all show moderte dependence on chemical doping level which presumably represents the in - plane normal - state carrier concentration , while remaining almost independent of the stacking unit distance .",
    "these parameters are closely related to the superconductivity mechanism of this layered superconductor .",
    "since the coherence length is a measure for the pair size , independence of @xmath133 on interlayer distance implies that interlayer coupling does not affect the pair formation .",
    "it is then possible to consider a picture in which fluctuating superconductivity exists within a given layer , while the layers are coupled weakly by josephson coupling to achieve 3-d bulk superconductivity .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath4 and @xmath59 are strongly affected by the interlayer distance .",
    "the reduction of @xmath4 with increasing stacking - unit distance can be understood as a simple reduction of the supercurrent density caused by lower density of the planes .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath59 on @xmath70 is not surprising : this behavior has been seen in many htsc cuprates .",
    "our results show that hf(zr)ncl with variable interlayer distance as well as carrier concentration is suitable for systematic studies of layered superconductors .",
    "in addition , low @xmath7 value of this compound makes it easier to cover the whole superconducting region in the @xmath120-@xmath63 plane , and helps our study of vortex phase diagram .    in fig .",
    "6 and fig . 7 , we have compared the results from the nitride - chlorides with other layered superconductors .",
    "all the arguments in the previous paragraphs , as well as fig .",
    "7 , give an impression that 2-d properties are predominantly important factor of all of these layered superconductors .",
    "however , comparison among different cuprate systems having different interlayer spacing @xmath70 indicates that the 3-d interlayer coupling plays a very important role in determing @xmath5 in the cuprates .",
    "furthermore , the observed results in fig . 7 show about a factor 2 deviation from the @xmath18 line .",
    "these results indicate that a simple theory for kt transition , whose @xmath135 is unrelated to the interlayer coupling , is not applicable either to the cuprates nor to the nitride - chloride systems .",
    "further experimental and theoretical studies are required to determine the origin of this deviation .",
    "studies of crossover from bose einstein to bcs condensation , in the case of 2-d systems , might provide a clue for understanding this feature .",
    "the absolute values of the penetration depth @xmath8 , obtained from the @xmath0sr and magnetization measurements , show a reasonable agreement .",
    "we notice , however , about 20 - 30 %  difference in the values from the two different methods ( see table 1 ) . @xmath0sr and magnetization estimates of @xmath8 often exhibit some disagreement of this magnitude , as can be found also in the cases of htsc and organic systems .",
    "ambiguity of @xmath8 with 20 - 30 %  would , however , correspond to @xmath31 50 %  ambiguity in the estimate of the superfluid density .",
    "in this situation , it would be ideal if there were a method to cross - check the superfluid density derived from @xmath0sr results in a completely different perspective .    in bi2212 cuprate systems ,",
    "@xcite measured the frequency dependent superfluid response , and found temperature @xmath18 above which the superfluid density depends on the measuring frequency .",
    "the superfluid density observed at @xmath92 was consistent with the value expected in the universal argument of kt .",
    "this provides an excellent system - independent calibration to the superfluid density .",
    "the difference between the superfluid density at @xmath18 and at @xmath136 should correspond to the distance ( in the horizontal direction ) of the corresponding data point in fig .",
    "7 from the @xmath18 line .",
    "the @xmath0sr bi2212 data point in a plot like fig . 7 lie about a factor 2 - 3 away from the @xmath18 line .",
    "this factor agrees reasonably well with the reduction of the superfluid density from the @xmath91 value to the @xmath92 value observed by corson _",
    "@xcite in bi2212 system in a similar doping region .",
    "this satiafactory cross - check for the bi2212 system indicates that our choice of the conversion factor between @xmath51 and @xmath8 was reasonable , and the superfluid density derived by @xmath0sr is very reliable .",
    "of course , comparisons among @xmath0sr data for different systems in a relative scale can be performed without being affected by an ambiguity of their absolute values of the superfluid density .",
    "we performed @xmath0sr measurements on three different specimens based on zrncl with li concentraitons 0.15 , 0.17 and 0.4 , and found that the results of 2-d superfluid density @xmath73 for these systems do not show much difference among one another .",
    "this phenomenon could be explained by two different possibilities : ( a ) not all the li atoms donnate carriers on the zrn planes , and the li concentration @xmath6 does not serve as an indicator of normal - state carrier concentraion ; or ( b ) all the li atoms donnate electrons to the zrn planes , but only a finite fraction of those normal - state carriers participate in the superfluid .",
    "the situation ( b ) is similar to the case of overdoped htsc cuprates  @xcite , where an energy - balance in the condensation process seems to determine the superfluid density .",
    "further experiments on normal - state transport properties are required to distinguish between ( a ) and ( b ) in the nitride - chloride systems .    in conclusion , we have synthesized and characterized several different specimens of intercalated nitride - chloride superconductors , and performed @xmath0sr and magnetization measurements .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath5 and the upper critical field @xmath137 exhibit a nearly linear relation with the 2-d superfluid density @xmath73 , while showing almost no dependence on the stacking unit distance .",
    "these features suggest a highly two - dimensional nature of superconductivity in the nitride - chloride system .",
