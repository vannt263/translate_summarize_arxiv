    "however , up to now path integrals have not been applied to atomic physics problem - electron charge transfer processes .",
    "we generalize the path integral approach to the problem of the rearragemenet collisions and , in particularly , to the capture of an electron by an ion passing another atom .",
    "it is so - called the electron charge transfer process .",
    "the charge transfer process is an important atomic physics process .",
    "besides the intrinsic interest in the charge transfer as a fundamental physical process , a knowledge of its mechanisms is a prerequisite for an understanding of radiation detectors , radiation damage in matter , injection into thermonuclear fusion systems , astrophysical processes , gas discharges , mass spectrometry and numerous other practical devices .",
    "the theory of the charge transfer reactions based on the traditional quantum - mechanical approaches can be found in the set of monographs ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the recent experimental data and references can be found in @xcite , @xcite .    in the framework of the path integral",
    "approach we have reformulated the problem of calculation of charge transfer cross section .",
    "we have developed two new alternative quantum mechanical influence functionals in the problem of the electron charge transfer .",
    "we treat the electron charge transfer process either as an electron transition problem or as an reciprocal elastic scattering of ion and atom in the some effective potential field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in sec.2",
    "we develop the path integral approach to elastic scattering problem . as an application of the developed approach we have reproduced the well known equation for differential cross section in the first - order born approximation .",
    "in sec.3 we have generalized the path integral approach to atomic physics rearragemenet collisions problem .",
    "the cross section for the electron charge transfer process is expressed in the terms of the path integral .",
    "as was shown by r. feynman @xcite , it is possible to describe the quantum mechanical system in terms of the transition amplitude @xmath0 ,    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the  start point  and @xmath3 is the ",
    "end point  of the quantum - mechanical evolution , @xmath4 means integration over all possible trajectories @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the classical action of the mechanical system as a functional of its trajectory @xmath5 , and @xmath7 is the planck s constant .    in order to clarify the meaning of the above expressions we observe the particle of the mass @xmath8 moving in the potential field @xmath9 .",
    "the classical action for this mechanical system is given by    @xmath10    we divide the time interval @xmath11 into @xmath12 steps of width @xmath13 .",
    "then the functional @xmath14 can be represented by the function @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the points which coincide with the trajectory @xmath17 at the moments @xmath18 ( @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "hence , the path integral given by eq.([eq1 ] ) can be written as follows    @xmath22    @xmath23    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the eq.([eq3 ] ) presents the transition quantum mechanical amplitude    @xmath26 from the point @xmath27 to the point @xmath28 .",
    "let us show how to apply the path integral approach to some known atomic physics problems .",
    "consider the scattering of a non relativistic electron on the central potential @xmath29 .",
    "being outside of the interaction region ( we assume that the potential is different from zero only in some local area ) the electron moves as a free particle . hence the wave function of the incident electron is just a plane wave    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the electron momentum and @xmath32 is the electron energy .",
    "the normalization of the wave function @xmath33 is chosen in such way that the incident flux @xmath34 will be equal to the electron velocity    @xmath35    then the knowledge of the transition amplitude and  fixing  of initial state of physical system give the general solution for the evolution of a quantum mechanical system in the potential @xmath36    @xmath37    since we are only interested in the elastic scattering cross section we should exclude un - scattered component of the total flux .",
    "this component is due to  unperturbed  ( or free ) evolution of the incident particles .",
    "hence , we have the following expression for the wave function @xmath38 of the final states of our interest    @xmath39    where the free ( unperturbed ) particle transition amplitude @xmath40 is given by    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    taking into account the definitions given by eqs.([eq6 ] ) - ( [ eq8 ] ) the wave function @xmath44 can be written as    @xmath45    @xmath46    physical characteristic of the scattering process is the differential scattering cross section @xmath47 .",
    "it is defined as the ratio of the number of particles scattered into the solid angle @xmath48 per unit time to the flux density of the incident particles .",
    "there are @xmath49 particles ( electrons ) that pass through the elementary area @xmath50 per unit time . here",
    "@xmath51 is the radial component of the particle flux density    @xmath52    hence the differential cross section is defined by the following equation @xcite    @xmath53    where @xmath34 and @xmath51 are given by eq.([eq5 ] ) and eq.([eq10 ] ) reciprocally .",
    "thus , eqs.([eq9])-([eq11 ] ) are the path integral approach to the non - relativistic quantum mechanical problem of elastic scattering .",
    "let us show that in first - order perturbation theory eqs.([eq9])-([eq11 ] ) give the well known result of the quantum mechanical scattering theory ( the first - order born approximation , @xcite ) .    in the first order on the @xmath54 eq.([eq9 ] ) can be written as    @xmath55    @xmath56    if the wave function @xmath57 is defined according to eq.([eq4 ] ) then eq.([eq12 ] ) is read    @xmath58    @xmath59 here @xmath60 is the free particle quantum mechanical transition amplitude given by eq.([eq8 ] ) .",
    "it is convenient to present eq.([eq8 ] ) as the fourier integral    @xmath61 substituting the above equation for @xmath62 in eq.([eq13 ] ) yields    @xmath63    @xmath64    @xmath65 further , by integrating over the @xmath66 we find    @xmath67    when the distance from the origin is much bigger then the effective range for the potential @xmath54 it is possible to approximate @xmath68 where @xmath69 . then the eq.([eq14 ] ) will transformed into the following one    @xmath70    @xmath71 thus , with the help of eqs.([eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) the differential cross section defined by eq.([eq11 ] ) can be read as    @xmath72    this is the well known the first - order born approximation @xcite for the differential scattering cross section .",
    "introducing the notation @xmath73 for the transferred momentum    @xmath74 allows for eq.([eq16 ] ) to be written as    @xmath75    where    @xmath76 is a fourier transform of the scattering potential that corresponds to the transferred momentum @xmath73 .",
    "thus , we have shown how the path integral approach to elastic scattering problem allows to obtain the cross section eq.([eq17 ] ) in the first - order born approximation .",
    "in this section we apply the approach developed in the sec.2 to the electron charge transfer problem .    the classical mechanical action for a system of two heavy particles ( resting in the lab system neutral atom a and a moving positive ion b@xmath77 ) that exchange an electron between each other can be written as follows    @xmath78    @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the coordinate of the moving ion b@xmath77 , m is the mass of the ion b@xmath77 , @xmath81 is the coordinate of the electron in the lab frame placed on the resting neutral atom a. in eq.([eq18 ] ) @xmath82 is the interaction potential for the system ( e@xmath83+a@xmath77 ) .",

    "@xmath89 has the following form    @xmath90    the path integral over two paths @xmath91 and @xmath5 can be treated by means of the influence functionals .",
    "the term influence functional was introduced by feynman @xcite .",
    "indeed suppose we carry out the path integration over the ion trajectories @xmath91 .",
    "then the result can be written as    @xmath92    @xmath93    where the influence functional @xmath94 has the form    @xmath95    @xmath96    the influence functional @xmath97 defined by eq.([eq21 ] ) is in fact transition amplitude for ion under the influence of a potential @xmath98 which is computed assuming @xmath5 is held to be a fixed path as @xmath99 changes .",
    "it is obviously that the influence functional @xmath100 is a functional of @xmath101 .",
    "let us represent the influence functional    @xmath102 in the following way    @xmath103    or    @xmath104    @xmath96    where the effective potential @xmath105 has been introduced .",
    "then eq.([eq20 ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath106    @xmath107    as a result we have just the path integral over the electron path @xmath108 .",
    "thus , eq.([eq24 ] ) allows treat the electron charge transfer problem as the electron transition under the influence of the perturbation @xmath109 .",
    "it is possible to introduce another influence functional in the problem of electron charge transfer .",
    "indeed , by integrating over all electron trajectories @xmath17 we find for the transition amplitude @xmath110 the following equation    @xmath111    @xmath112    where the influence functional @xmath113 is given by    @xmath114    @xmath115    the influence functional @xmath116 defined by eq.([eq26 ] ) is in fact the electron transition amplitude under the influence of a potential @xmath117 which is computed assuming @xmath91 is held to be a fixed path as @xmath5 changes .",

    "the transition amplitude @xmath87 can now be written to have only path integration over the ion trajectories @xmath123    @xmath124    @xmath125    this equation allows to consider the charge transfer problem as the elastic scattering of the ion on the effective scattering potential @xmath126 , where @xmath122 is introduced by eq.([eq28 ] ) .",
    "the eqs.([eq22])-([eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq27])-([eq29 ] ) represent the electron charge transfer problem in the terms of the influence functionals @xmath102 or @xmath119 .",

    "the geometry of the electron charge transfer problem is shown in fig .",
