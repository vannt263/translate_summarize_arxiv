    "cosmic strings are very massive topological defects which could have formed via the kibble mechanism @xcite during one of the phase transitions in the early universe such as the grand unification phase transition or the electroweak phase transition .",
    "they are analogous to defects in condensed matter physics , such as flux tubes in superconductors or vortex filaments in superfluid helium @xcite being thus intimately connected to spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the study of cosmic strings is currently motivated by the possibility that their production is related to inflation models resulting from string theory @xcite .",
    "brane inflation is a popular inflationary model that can be embedded into string theory and predicts the formation of cosmic string networks at the end of inflation @xcite .",
    "e.g. in the framework of type iib string theory the inflaton field corresponds to the distance between two dirichlet branes with 3 spatial dimensions ( d@xmath3-branes ) and inflation ends when these two branes collide and annihilate .",
    "the production of strings ( and lower dimensional branes ) then results from the collision of these two branes .",
    "each of the original d3-branes has a u(1 ) gauge symmetry that gets broken when the branes annihilate . if the gauge combination is higgsed , magnetic flux tubes of this gauge field carrying ramond - ramond ( r - r ) charge are d - branes with one spatial dimension , so - called d - strings",
    ". when the gauge combination is confined the field is condensated into electric flux tubes carrying neveu schwarz - neveu schwarz ( ns - ns ) charges and these objects are fundamental strings ( f - strings ) @xcite .",
    "d - strings and f - strings are so - called cosmic superstrings @xcite which seem to be a generic prediction of supersymmetric hybrid inflation @xcite and grand unified based inflationary models @xcite . d- and f - strings , however , have different properties than the usual ( solitonic ) cosmic strings .",
    "the probability of intercommutation of solitonic strings is equal to one but less than one in the case of cosmic superstrings .",
    "therefore , solitonic strings do not merge , while cosmic superstrings tend to form bound states .",
    "when p f - strings and q d - strings interact , they can merge and form bound states , so - called ( p , q)-strings @xcite whose properties have been investigated @xcite .",
    "even though the origin of ( p , q)-strings is type iib string theory , their properties can be investigated in the framework of field theoretical models @xcite . the influence of gravity on field theoretical ( p , q)-strings has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the field theoretical model most frequently used to study cosmic strings is the u(1 ) abelian - higgs model @xcite , which possesses static , line - like solutions .",
    "these solutions are straight strings in the sense that their fields do not depend on the @xmath4-coordinate .",
    "these straight strings can be interpreted as a local description for potentially curved objects , when viewed at large scales .",
    "in fact , it is believed that they are part of intricate , dynamical networks of interacting cosmic strings @xcite , which may bend , collide and eventually form a multitude of loops .",
    "if strings have no internal structure , as in the u(1 ) abelian - higgs model , these cosmic string loops would rapidly disappear through self - gravitational collapse , radiating all their energy away @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , string loops may survive if they carry a current in their core .",
    "such current - carrying string loops are called vortons and , in the simplest scenario , they reach a stable , ring - like shape @xcite .",
    "further studies showed that vortons could have been produced from cosmic strings appearing during the electroweak phase transition @xcite . in order to understand the cosmological implications of such objects it is essential to know about their stability and is",
    "has been suggested that vortons can be unstable under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "a current carrying string can be most simply described using a u(1)@xmath1u(1 ) model @xcite . in this case",
    "the u(1 ) abelian - higgs model is coupled to a u(1 ) abelian - scalar field model through a potential term .",
    "the u(1 ) symmetry of the latter is unbroken , which leads to a locally conserved noether current and a globally conserved noether charge .",
    "if the u(1 ) symmetry is gauged as has been the case in the original proposal @xcite , the energy density per unit length diverges due to the logarithmic fall - off of the electromagnetic field .",
    "it has hence been suggested to consider the unbroken u(1 ) symmetry to be global or equivalently the corresponding gauge coupling to be small in order to have localized superconducting strings @xcite . in this limit",
    "it is possible to apply the formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "this distinguishes between superconducting strings with time - like currents ( `` electric '' regime ) and space - like currents ( `` magnetic '' regime ) and relates the longitudinal and transversal perturbations on the string to the energy and tension per unit length giving explicit criteria for the stability of these objects .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that within the full u(1)@xmath1u(1 ) model longitudinal perturbations always propagate more slowly than transverse ones .",
    "moreover , a general logarithmic equation of state was suggested in @xcite which has been confirmed numerically to hold @xcite .",
    "recent studies have explored a possibility of coupling two u(1 ) abelian - higgs models ( with both u(1 ) symmetries broken ) via a gauge field interaction term @xcite .",
    "this interaction has been motivated by the possible existence of a separate , dark matter sector in the universe @xcite , which allows for the existence of so called `` dark strings '' @xcite .",
    "this dark sector would weakly interact with the standard model sector through a small gauge field interaction and is motivated by recent astrophysical observations @xcite that have shown an excess electronic production in the galaxy with electrons having energies between a few gev and a few tev . in @xcite , the interaction of dark strings with u(1 ) abelian - higgs strings was studied and the possibility of forming bound states was explored .",
    "this study was extended to semilocal strings @xcite which are solutions of a su(2)@xmath1u(1 ) model with an ungauged su(2 ) symmetry .    in this paper",
    "we study bound states of a u(1)@xmath0 @xmath1u(1)@xmath2 superconducting string and an abelian - higgs string .",
    "we will put the emphasize on the study of the stability of the superconducting strings when these are coupled via an attractive gauge interaction to abelian - higgs strings .",
    "our model can be seen as a toy model for ( p , q)-strings in which the attractive interaction mediated by the scalar fields as suggested in the original model @xcite is replaced by an attractive interaction mediated by the gauge fields .",
    "d - strings can carry currents .",
    "in @xcite the formation of vortons from superconducting d - strings carrying chiral fermion zero modes has been discussed , while it has been suggested that d - strings could also carry bosonic currents in special cases , e.g. if a d - string would be coincident with a d7-brane @xcite . in the following",
    "we will hence assume that the superconducting string in the bound state is a superconducting d - string .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we give the model in section [ model ] .",
    "we present our results in section [ results ] and conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "from a qualitative perspective the field theoretical model studied in this paper is a combination of the models studied in @xcite . for the vanishing - current limit",
    "it can also be seen as an alternative to the field theoretical toy model for ( p , q)-strings suggested in @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the attractive interaction between the p- and the q - string is mediated via a scalar field potential term , while here the attractive interaction is mediated via a gauge field term .",
    "the model without currents has been studied in @xcite . here",
    ", we extend this investigation assuming that one of the strings possesses a current . our model could hence be a toy model for ( p , q)-strings where the q d - strings are superconducting .",

    "the interactions between the two scalar fields of the superconducting string , which is responsible for the existence of the current , is here mediated by the constant @xmath24 .",
    "note that the constant @xmath25 in the quartic potential of @xmath26 has been eliminated from the model , as it would simply shift the energies by a constant term .",

    "fig.[vels1:l ] also shows that the transition to the unstable , magnetic region ( point `` c '' ) is attained for lower @xmath51 as @xmath148 increases .    in order to better understand these effects ,",
    "the value at all current markers and the energy intervals of all current regions are plotted as functions of @xmath148 in fig.[gbb:1 ] and fig.[gbb:2 ] , respectively .",
    "fig.[gbb:1 ] shows that the complete magnetic and stable magnetic regions both decrease with @xmath148 in @xmath51 space , while the electric region remains the same ( because both @xmath167 and @xmath168 are constant with @xmath169 for our choice of parameters ( [ potparams ] ) and @xmath170 by definition ) .",
    "the value of @xmath171 is constant ( see ) , but joins the curve for @xmath172 at @xmath173 .",
    "fig.[gbb:2 ] shows that the energy widths of all current regions decrease with @xmath148 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the magnetic region would vanish long before the electric one .",
    "we illustrate the influence of @xmath21 on the current nature @xmath164 and on the tension - energy diagram @xmath121 in fig.[ge ] for @xmath173 .",
    "one can see that the influence is qualitatively similar to the influence of @xmath148 .",
    "fig.[ge:1 ] shows that the increase of @xmath21 leads to the decrease of the maximal possible current on the string before it decouples ( @xmath161 and hence @xmath142 ) .",
    "the critical value of @xmath96 beyond which no stationary solutions exist ( the so - called phase frequency threshold at @xmath169 ) also decreases . for large enough @xmath21",
    "we find that @xmath52 always and the magnetic regime completely disappears .",
    "we find that this happens for @xmath174 if @xmath150 .    in fig.[ge:2",
    "] we show the dependence of @xmath67 on @xmath66 for reasonably small values of @xmath21 . increasing @xmath21 decreases the tension @xmath67 and energy @xmath66 such that the curves get shifted downwards along a line @xmath175 for increasing @xmath21 .",
    "we also illustrate the influence of @xmath21 on the tangential @xmath82 and longitudinal @xmath83 propagation velocities in fig.[vels2:t ] and [ vels2:l ] , respectively . @xmath82",
    "increases with @xmath21 while @xmath83 decreases , within both the electric and magnetic regions .",
    "it is remarkable that , when @xmath176 and the magnetic region is no longer present , the velocities @xmath177 and @xmath178 as the condensate vanishes @xmath179 at @xmath180 . in this case , the @xmath121 curve only keeps part of the electric branch , as can be seen in fig.[elbr ] .",
    "diagram when the magnetic region is no longer present , for @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath145 , @xmath146.,width=302 ]    we are mainly interested in how the energy widths of the main current regions change with @xmath21 . in fig.[eog ] , fig.[eom ] , fig.[eoc ] and fig.[esc ] we show the values of @xmath136 , @xmath131 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively in dependence on @xmath21 for several values of @xmath148 .",
    "we observe that all values decrease with increasing @xmath21 .",
    "the quantitative form of these curves depends on @xmath148 . a larger @xmath148 shifts the curves downwards correlating with a decrease of the width of the flux tube in sector 2 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for certain combinations of @xmath183 the energy widths @xmath184 vanish , which implies that the magnetic region completely vanishes for these parameter choices .",
    "the larger @xmath148 , i.e the smaller the width of the flux tube of the superconducting string with respect to that of the abelian - higgs string , the smaller the value of @xmath185 at which the magnetic regime disappears and no space - like currents are possible .",
    "we find e.g. @xmath186 for @xmath187 , @xmath188 for @xmath189 and @xmath190 for @xmath191 .",
    "even though @xmath138 decreases with increasing @xmath21 this is related to the overall shrinking of the entire magnetic branch .",
    "in order to understand how the position of point `` s '' changes relative to the other current markers within the magnetic region , the tension - energy derivative ( negative propagation velocity for longitudinal waves ) at this point is plotted as a function of @xmath21 in fig.[sderiveps ] .",
    "+    one can see that the derivative is always positive and increases with @xmath21 until reaching the upper , magnetic limit where `` s '' coincides with `` m '' . for @xmath192 ,",
    "this already happens at @xmath149 .",
    "our results hence imply that  at least for the potential parameters used here  the condition @xmath193 is falsified ( if at all ) only in the region where the string is already unstable according to criterion .      here",
    "we fix @xmath150 . in this case",
    "the energy @xmath66 and tension @xmath67 are simply given by @xmath194 when the current is absent or neutral , i.e. at points `` m '' and `` o '' , respectively , if @xmath123 .",
    "this is related to the fact that the choice @xmath195 and @xmath196 corresponds to the bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) limit if the two strings do not carry currents and are not coupled .",
    "first of all , consider the current nature and tension - energy diagrams for @xmath197 as shown in fig .",
    "[ first ] .",
    "when comparing this with fig.[ge ] it becomes clear that increasing the windings produces qualitative and quantitative changes .",
    "we observe that an increase in the windings , which corresponds to an increase in the magnetic fluxes @xmath198 , @xmath199 , leads to an increase in the maximal possible current on the superconducting string before the current decouples ( @xmath161 and hence @xmath142 )",
    ". moreover , the value of @xmath96 at the phase frequency threshold @xmath169 increases . in order to understand the behaviour of the current regions for different combinations of the windings , we have plotted @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 in fig.[eon ] , fig.[mon ] and fig.[con ] , respectively , for all combinations of @xmath203 and @xmath150 .",
    "+     +     +    we observe that the overall energy widths of all current regions dramatically increase with the increase of @xmath155 .",
    "moreover , an increase in @xmath154 produces a shift of all curves , which also increases with @xmath21 .",
    "however , the ordering of the curves for a certain @xmath155 is not solely dependent on @xmath154 , but also on @xmath155 , even though we could not deduce the exact ordering rules ( if any ) from our numerical data .",
    "nonetheless , these effects should be connected with the observation made in @xcite stating that strings of equal windings bind stronger . from this one",
    "is led to conclude that for a given @xmath155 the energy widths are smallest for @xmath204 .",
    "however , we only observe this to be strictly true for @xmath205 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the interaction of superconducting strings with abelian - higgs strings via an attractive gauge field interaction and have investigated the stability of the superconducting strings .",
    "we have chosen the unbroken u(1 ) symmetry of the superconducting string to be ungauged in order to maintain the localized character of the solution in accordance with @xcite .",
    "we find that the change of the interaction parameter has similar effects than the change of the ratio between the radius of the flux tube of the superconducting and that of the abelian - higgs string .",
    "increasing either the interaction parameter and hence increasing the attractive interaction between the superconducting and abelian - higgs string or the ratio of the widths leads to a decrease in the maximal possible current on the superconducting string and a decrease of the condensate on the string axis given by @xmath206 at the phase frequency threshold beyond which no stationary solutions exist and at which the tension and energy diverge .",
    "while the strings are stable with respect to longitudinal and transverse perturbation if they carry time - like currents , there is only a limited domain in the case of space - like currents where they are stable with respect to longitudinal perturbations .",
    "we find that space - like currents are not possible for sufficiently strong interaction between the superconducting and abelian - higgs string and/or small enough ratio between the widths of the flux tubes .",
    "increasing the windings and hence the magnetic fluxes on the strings leads to an increase in the maximal possible current on the string and an increase of the condensate on the string axis @xmath207 at the phase frequency threshold .",
    "our results have important implications for vorton formation in models where cosmic strings are coupled to superconducting strings . in the case of ( p ,",
    "q)-strings a field theoretical model has been developed that describes the bound state of p f - strings and q d - strings by two coupled abelian - higgs strings identifying p and q with the windings of the respective strings @xcite .",
    "the model studied in this paper is an extension of this model by allowing the d - string to carry a bosonic current which was shown to be possible in special cases @xcite .",
