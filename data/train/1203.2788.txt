    "the radio galaxy is a very active and powerful emitter of radiation at all observed wavebands . while classified as a seyfert 1 @xcite , its spectrum shows broad emission lines and a complex optical morphology which has been interpreted as the result of a past merger @xcite .",
    "variability in the emission lines has allowed reverberation mapping to yield a black hole mass of @xmath8 @xcite . in x - rays , it is the brightest broad - line radio galaxy , with the x - ray spectrum becoming softer when the intensity increases @xcite , suggesting that the soft x - rays are dominated by the disk instead of the beamed jet .",

    "longer wavelength very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations have shown evidence for the existence of an underlying helical jet structure @xcite , which has been interpreted as the result of jet precession @xcite    combination of the information from a sequence of 12 monthly polarimetric vlba observations of at 15 , 22 and 43 ghz has allowed imaging of the linearly polarized emission within the innermost @xmath11mas jet structure , revealing a coherent in time faraday screen and polarization angles @xcite .",
    "gradients in faraday rotation and degree of polarization across and along the jet are observed , together with a localized region of high ( @xmath12 rad m@xmath13 ) faraday rotation measure ( rm ) between approximately 3 and 4 mas from the core .",
    "the existence of this localized region of high rm , together with the observation of uncorrelated changes in the rm screen and rm - corrected polarization angles , suggest that a significant fraction of the faraday rm found in originates in foreground clouds , rather than in a sheath intimately associated with the emitting jet @xcite .",
    "vlba observations of in november 2007 revealed a component ( hereafter c80 ) located at 80 mas ( which corresponds to a de - projected distance of @xmath7190pc for a viewing angle of 16@xmath14 ) with a brightness temperature @xmath15 k , which is about 600 times higher than expected at such distances from the core @xcite .",
    "analysis of previous observations ( starting in 1982 ) shows that this component was not detected at frequencies higher than 5 ghz before april 2007 , when was first observed at 15 ghz .",

    "@xcite conclude that the unusually high @xmath16 of c80 could be explained by a helical shocked jet model  and perhaps some flow acceleration  but it seems very unlikely that this corresponds to the usual shock that emerges from the core and travels downstream to the location of c80 , requiring some other intrinsic process capable of providing a local amplification in the density of high energy particles and/or magnetic field .    here",

    "the new multi - frequency and polarimetric vlba images of the jet in presented in this paper were obtained from observations performed on 2009 december 14 , 2010 march 14 , and 2010 june 21 .",
    "the corresponding observations , that employed all ten antennas of the vlba , were performed at 5 , 8 , and 12ghz ( see figs .",
    "[ 5ghz][12ghz ] ) , and used a 2-bit signal sampling to record in a 32 mhz bandwidth per circular polarization at a recording rate of 256 mbits / s .",
    "calibration of the data was performed within the aips software package following the standard procedure for vlbi polarimetric observations @xcite . to correct for opacity effects on the higher frequency observations ( @xmath24ghz ) we used the recorded variation of the system temperature on every station to solve for the receiver temperature and zenith opacity .",

    "the useful input from the first of these two methods was rather limited in our case because the vla / vlba polarization calibration program does not include data at 12ghz , and the program was halted at the end of 2009 to focus on evla commissioning , hence preventing us from getting the calibration at 5 and 8ghz for the latest two observing epochs in 2010 .",

    "no other jet feature is detected in the jet downstream of c80 in the 12 and 15ghz images presented here .",
    "however , the new 5ghz images show an emission region in an arc from north to south around the eastern side of c80 , having the shape of an inverted bow shock , similar to those observed at the end of the large scale jets of fr - ii radio galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "perhaps because of the lack of sensitivity , this arc of emission ( that we have labeled as a80 ) was not detected by our previous short - integration vlba observations of the source at 5ghz ( see * ? ? ?",

    "this emission structure will be called b80 - 100 hereafter ( see fig .",
    "[ 5ghz ] ) . neither the total intensity nor the polarized emission is symmetric with regard to the jet axis in b80 - 100 . the maxima in total and linearly polarized intensity are both located on the southern side of the bubble , which resembles the behavior of the jet in within the first @xmath11mas @xcite .",
    "further downstream from c80 ( but still within b80 - 100 ) , c90 , a more extended jet region reported by @xcite and @xcite at observing frequencies below 8ghz , starts to be resolved in our new images ( figs .",
    "[ 5ghz ] and [ 8ghz ] ) .",
    "our 8ghz images in 2009 and 2010 show the jet emission around c90 as a slightly more extended and sparser jet region than in the image taken in 2007 november 30 by @xcite at the same frequency .",
    "c90 is better observed in our 5ghz images , that map the entire b80 - 100 at higher sensitivity .",

    "our new images also show a bright and compact jet region located @xmath31mas from the core  reported here for the first time  that we have labeled c99 .",
    "our kinematic study of this feature also reveals superluminal proper motion ( @xmath32 ) of similar magnitude and direction downstream the jet than c90 .",
    "the superluminal character of the flow downstream from c80 resembles the behavior near the hst-1 knot in as reported by @xcite , who suggested hst-1 as the site of a recollimation shock in the jet of ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    given the typical superluminal motions previously detected in on smaller jet scales ( @xmath33 ; * ? ? ?",

    "our 5ghz images show that c99 s flux density increases progressively from 2009 december 14 , to 2010 june 21 , which provides a better explanation for why c99 was not detected in our previous 5ghz observations in 2007 november 30 .      as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ 5ghz ] ( see also figs .  [ 8ghz ] to [ 15ghz ] ) , the linearly polarized emission in a80 closely follows that of the total intensity , with values of the degree of polarization up to @xmath35% ( see also fig .",
    "[ pcut ] ) , and the evpas distributed nearly perpendicular to the arc - shaped structure of a80 , as expected in the case of a shock front .",
    "the observations presented here show a nearly constant flux density evolution of c80/a80 , and confirm the large brightness temperature as well as its stationarity , both within our new observing epochs and with regard to the reported position of c80 at earlier epochs .",
    "these properties appear remarkably similar to those expected in the case of conical recollimation shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and will be discussed in detail in the next session .",
    "interestingly , the region of b80 - 100 close to the jet axis and downstream from the sharp edge of a80 appears unpolarized in our 5ghz images .",
    "in contrast , weak linear polarization emission ( with evpa nearly perpendicular to the local jet axis ) starts to be discerned further downstream at @xmath11mas from the eastern edge of a80 .",
    "the strong linear polarization emission of c99 shows its evpa distribution parallel to the jet axis , which , together with the measured superluminal motion , may be an indication of a travelling plane shock wave perpendicular to the axis .",
    "figure [ rm ] shows the rotation measure image of 3c  120 for december 2009 made by combining the data between 5 and 15ghz .",
    "the rm images for the other two epochs of our observations show very similar results as those for december 2009 , and are therefore not shown . as can be seen in the inset panels of fig .",
    "[ rm ] , we obtain good fits to a @xmath36 law of the evpas throughout the jet , except at longer wavelengths in the innermost @xmath74 mas , probably due to beam depolarization and opacity .",
    "the rm screen shown in fig .",
    "[ rm ] is in excellent agreement with that obtained for observations taken in november 2007 ( see fig .",
    "7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , providing further confirmation for the stationarity of the faraday screen in 3c  120 claimed previously @xcite .",
    "note , however , that relatively rapid changes ( in scales of tens of months ) in the rm have also been observed in the innermost @xmath72 mas of the jet @xcite .",
    "our new observations also confirm the negative gradient in rm with distance along the jet , including a sign reversal at @xmath78 mas from the core .",
    "the motion of component c16 along the jet during the two years time span between the 2007 observations of @xcite and ours have allowed the mapping of the rm further downstream , revealing a rm of @xmath37 rad m@xmath13 , fully consistent with the rm gradient along the jet mentioned previously .",
    "component c80/a80 has a small rotation measure of @xmath38 rad m@xmath13 , leading to a faraday rotation in the evpas at our longest observing wavelength of 6 cm ( 5ghz ) of 4 degrees , within the estimated error in our absolute calibration of the evpas .",
    "we therefore can conclude that our evpa maps of c80/a80 are not affected by faraday rotation .",
    "the structure and polarization of the a80 feature point towards an origin in the kind of shock that can occur when the internal pressure of a jet adjusts as a result of changes to its environment .",
    "this type of structure has been suggested as the origin of the hst-1 knot in m87 @xcite .",
    "a jet that is initially freely expanding may become underpressured and is therefore recollimated by a conical shock converging away from the nucleus .",
    "such shocks may reflect from the jet axis , producing a second conical shock diverging away from the nucleus , that further adjusts the collimation of the jet .",
    "the result is a structure consisting of a pair of point - to - point conical shocks that have been found to occur both in experiments and numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a80",
    ", there is no evidence for a converging shock the shape of the structure , particularly in polarized intensity , suggests a diverging cone that will divert the flow away from the axis causing a drop in pressure .",
    "this therefore appears to indicate that a80 has arisen because the jet has rapidly become overpressured , perhaps as a result of a sudden drop in external pressure at this point . though this seems the most probable explanation it is possible that the jet has encountered small object ",
    "perhaps a molecular cloud typical of the narrow - line emission regions in agn  near the axis of the jet , and that the conical shock represents the resulting wake .",
    "this explanation seems less probable because it depends on the lucky chance that the obstacle is near the jet axis , but it is in agreement with previous indications for a jet / cloud collision at distances closer to the core @xcite .    here",
    ", the a80 feature is modelled as a diverging conical shock using the models described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these models assume the plasma to be a relativistic gas with sound speed @xmath39 .",
    "previous monitoring of the proper motions in 3c  120 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is possible to estimate the maximum viewing angle , @xmath41 , and the minimum lorentz factor of the jet , @xmath42 .",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the value @xmath43 is therefore assumed , being also relevant to the components labelled l5 to l8 by @xcite in the region upstream from c80 .",
    "this value is used to constrain the properties of the upstream flow .",
    "the 5ghz images presented in this paper are used to constrain the properties of the shock wave .",
    "the projected semi - opening angle @xmath44 of the conical shock is best estimated from the polarized intensity images presented earlier in this paper ( fig .",
    "[ 5ghz ] ) .",
    "the cone axis is taken to be a line inclined at approximately @xmath45 from ew , pointing directly back to the radio core structure .",
    "the opening angle deduced from the distribution of polarized flux density is about @xmath46 , but after convolution of model structures with the elliptical beam , the best fit to this is found from a projected opening angle in the region of @xmath47 corresponding to @xmath48 .",
    "the angle between the polarization rods on either side of the structure ( measured where the polarized flux density is brightest ) is in the region of @xmath46 .",
    "since the model polarization @xmath49 rods are orthogonal to the projected edge of the conical structure , a value of @xmath48 corresponds to an angle of @xmath50 between the polarization rods on the two sides .",
    "however , after convolution , this angle is reduced to approximately @xmath46 , in agreement with the images , as a result of the influence of the polarized structure nearer the axis .",
    "a value of @xmath51 much less than @xmath52 would be hard to reconcile with both a symmetrical cone structure and an axis pointing back to the core region ; if the axis is maintained at its inclination of @xmath45 to ew , then the southern edge of the cone would then exclude much of the observed flux density .",
    "values of @xmath53 significantly greater than @xmath52 result in simulated polarization images that are inconsistent with those observed in that they do not reproduce the observed saddle point between the two sides of the polarization image .",
    "hence , a value for @xmath53 in the region of @xmath52 seems to offer the best chance of modelling the observed structure of a80 , and is therefore used in what follows .    the true semi - opening angle @xmath54 is related to @xmath44 by    @xmath55    which can be solved numerically for @xmath54 in terms of @xmath44 and @xmath56 .",

    "the polarization @xmath49 rods in the two elongated @xmath62 features are approximately perpendicular to the direction of elongation , which corresponds to the outline of the conical shock wave .",
    "models @xmath22 to @xmath63 produce simulations that differ mainly in two ways : first , the structures become more compact as @xmath56 increases , because the emission from the far side of the shock wave becomes relatively weaker ; and second , the degree of polarization increases as @xmath56 increases , mainly because the shock becomes stronger ( the compression factor of the shock @xmath64 decreases ) as a result of increasing values of @xmath54 and the upstream flow velocity ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the model best matching the degrees of polarization found in the images is model 3 . in this model ,",
    "the degree of polarization rises to about @xmath66 near the edges of a80 in the region of the peak in total intensity , and levels as high as this are seen in this region on the southern side of a80 ( as shown in the profiles plot of fig .",

    "the simulated images for model 3 are shown in fig .",
    "the model is reasonably successful in reproducing the observed structure in the vicinity of the @xmath61 peak .",
    "however , further downstream the observed polarization rods turn to become orthogonal to the axis whereas the model polarization rods turn in the opposite sense . on axis , the model polarization rods are parallel to the axis , but where on - axis polarization is seen in the observations , at distances greater than about @xmath67mas from the working surface , the rods are either orthogonal or oblique to the axis .",
    "it seems that if the conical shock model is appropriate , then it is the dominant influence on the polarized emission only within about @xmath67mas of the apex .",
    "another way in which the model is successful is in its prediction of a very large ratio of upstream to downstream intensity .",
    "the observations of @xcite have shown that c80 ( the brightest hot spot in a80 ) represents an increase in the intensity of emission with respect to the underlying jet by a factor of approximately @xmath68 , a figure that they found difficult to explain without invoking acceleration of the jet .",
    "if this is due to the formation of a shock structure , then the ratio of the up to downstream intensity should be about @xmath68 or greater .",
    "if the doppler factors of the up and downstream flows are @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , and the compression ratio is @xmath64 , then the intensity ratio should be approximately @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the spectral index for c80 @xcite . in estimating the value of @xmath73 the largest downstream doppler factor @xmath74 ( for flow at angle @xmath75 to the line of sight ) has been assumed .",
    "the values of @xmath64 , @xmath74 for the downstream flow closest to the line of sight and @xmath73 are shown in table  [ t1 ] . because @xmath76 for most of the downstream flow , @xmath73 is likely to be an overestimate of the intensity ratio , and",
    "so a second estimate based on an intensity weighted average of the downstream doppler factor , @xmath77 , has also been included in the table .",
    "table  [ t1 ] shows that , as @xmath56 increases from @xmath78 to @xmath79 , so the downstream to upstream brightness ratios , @xmath73 and @xmath77 increase very rapidly .",
    "the greater part of this effect is due to the compression of the plasma ( indicated by the value of @xmath64 ) , and its effect on the magnetic field and particle density .",
    "however the increase in the value of @xmath80 is also significant .",
    "this occurs because ( i ) @xmath69 is decreasing because @xmath56 is increasing and @xmath81 is also increasing in the regime where @xmath82 ; and ( ii ) because @xmath70 is varying only weakly , which occurs because although @xmath83 decreases and @xmath84 increases , the shock becomes stronger and parts of the downstream flow are directed closer to the observer s line of sight .    from table  [ t1 ]",
    "it is clear that parameters similar to those of model 3 ( @xmath5 ) , which gave the closest match for the fractional polarization values , should have a downstream to upstream brightness ratio of order several hundred .",
    "it therefore seems likely that such models can reasonably reproduce both the observed polarization structures and the very high ratio of down to upstream intensity demanded by @xcite .",
    "a few variants on the models described here have been investigated to determine whether they might explain the transverse polarization rods seen on the downstream side of c80 .",
    "first a poloidal magnetic field component was added , as described by @xcite .",
    "the influence of the poloidal field on the polarization is strongest on the near side of the shock front , producing transverse polarization rods near the peak in @xmath61 , where none are seen .",
    "the effect is negligible on the far side of the shock , which extends further downstream toward the region where transverse polarization rods would be desirable .",
    "the possibility that the upstream flow might be converging slightly has also been investigated , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "the effect was to increase the degree of polarization at a given value of @xmath56 , but otherwise the simulated images were very similar .",
    "it seems that neither of these modifications helped to explain the larger scale polarization properties beyond a80 .",
    "it is possible that allowing for a more complex upstream field structure might explain the entire polarization structure of b80 - 100 , but on the other hand , it seems likely that the conical shock is not the dominant influence on polarization toward the downstream edge of the b80 - 100 structure .",
    "indeed , the superluminal motion found for c90 and c99 suggests that instead the polarization structure downstream of a80 may be the result of moving plane - perpendicular shock waves that appear on the wake of the a80 conical shock .",
    "it is worth noting that , although the upstream doppler factor is rather low in model 3 ( @xmath85 ) the jet to counter - jet ratio is still reasonably high , giving @xmath86 for @xmath87 , as expected nearer the core .",
    "first analysis of the properties of component c80 were carried out by @xcite , concluding that although a helical shocked jet model  including perhaps some bulk flow acceleration ",
    "could explain the unusually large brightness temperature , it appears unlikely that it corresponds to the usual shock that moves from the core to the location of c80 .",
    "rather , @xcite proposed the need for an alternative process capable of explaining the high brightness temperature of c80 , its appearance in high frequency images after april 2007 , and its apparent stationarity .",
    "one of the possible alternatives considered by these authors involved a stationary shock at the location of c80 with emission suddenly enhanced by the arrival of a region of enhanced particle number in the jet flow , such as the one proposed to explain the kinematic and flux evolution properties of the hst-1 knot in @xcite .",
    "the main goal of the new observations presented here is to further constrain the physical processes taking place in the jet of that have led to the extreme properties of c80 .",
    "thanks to the increased sensitivity achieved by our new observations we report on the existence of the a80 arc of total intensity and linear polarization associated to c80 , as part of a larger bulge of emission that extends @xmath720 mas along and across the jet .",
    "most importantly , the polarization vectors are distributed perpendicularly to the semi - circular shape of a80 , as it would be expected for the case of a compression by a shock front .",
    "this evidence , together with the excess in brightness temperature displayed by c80/a80 and its stationarity in flux and position support the model suggested by @xcite in which c80/a80 corresponds to a standing shock .",
    "more specifically , our modeling suggests a conical recollimation shock .",
    "indeed , our simulations based on the synchrotron emission from a conical shock , as described by @xcite , reproduce quite closely the observed total and linearly polarized emission structure , the electric vector distribution , and the increased brightness temperature of c80/a80 , allowing constraints on the values of the jet flow in and the geometry of the conical shock at @xmath0mas from the core .",
    "in particular , our simulations provide the cone opening angle @xmath4 , the jet viewing angle @xmath5 at the location of a80 , and the upstream lorentz factor @xmath6 .",
    "an important issue to investigate further is the origin of the recollimation shock at such large distances from the core of emission in relativistic jets as in 3c  120 , and presumably in m87 . while for m87 it has been proposed that the recollimation originates from the transition between a parabolic to a conical shape @xcite , in 3c120 we suggest that the most plausible cause is a sudden drop in the external pressure , leading to the formation of a conical shock wave opening away from the nucleus .",
    "the study of the nature of c80  and the structure of its related a80 arc of emission  that we present in this paper were only possible thanks to the high angular resolution provided by the vlba and its large sensitivity and good performance for polarimetric observations .",
    "the use of synthetic images of the total intensity and linear polarization of conical shocks has also proven to be a powerful tool to interpret the nature of jet structures , and to constrain the physical and geometrical properties of such structures and the jet plasma that forms them .",
    "studies similar to that presented here can be carried out for a number of cases  additional potential examples might be the hst-1 and k1 knots in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "performing these studies will be important to obtain relevant information on the relativistic jets and their surrounding medium .",
