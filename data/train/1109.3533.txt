    "prandtl s soap film @xcite and nadai s @xcite sand heap analogies remain important tools for analysing the torsional loads and plastic deformations of cylindrical shafts @xcite . in this paper",
    "we propose a generalisation of prandtl s model in which the eponymous potential @xmath0 he introduced no - longer satisfies the linear laplace equation but rather a non - linear equation known as the born - infeld equation .",
    "this has the property that the prandtl potential @xmath0 is continuous but nevertheless the torsional stress @xmath1 never exceeds the plastic limit .",
    "the model also permits a remarkable unified continuous geometrical analogue combining both the soap - film and sand pile analogies as limiting cases .",
    "according to this unified analogy @xmath0 defines a spacelike maximal surface in an auxiliary 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime .",
    "in what follows we provide , for completeness , a brief rsum of prandtl s soap - film and nadia s sand heap analogy in the absence of body forces , the governing equations are _",
    "i t_ij=0[stress ] where @xmath2 is the _ stress tensor _ ( often often denoted in engineering texts @xmath3 or @xmath4 cf .",
    "the _ strain tensor _",
    "@xmath5 is defined in terms of displacements @xmath6 as @xmath7 in linear theory for an isotropic substance hooke s law becomes e_ij= 2 ( 1 + ) e t_ij -2 e _",
    "ij t_kk . where @xmath8 is _ poisson s ratio _ and @xmath9 is _ young s modulus_. following saint - venant@xcite we assume that the material is isotropic and confined to a prismatic cylinder with base @xmath10 whose generators are parallel to the @xmath11 axis and orthogonal to the plane curve @xmath12 . the displacements @xmath13 are assumed to satisfy @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant .",
    "the function @xmath16 is called the _ warp function _ and it gives the displacement parallel to the axis .",
    "these assumptions imply e_xx=",
    "e_yy= e_zz= e_xy=0 , e_yz= _ y w + x , e_zx= _ x w -y .",
    "hooke s law implies that the diagonal components of the stress tensor ( the _ elongations _ ) vanish and therefore equation ( [ stress ] ) gives _ x t_xz + _ x t_yz = 0 ( this only requires @xmath17 )",
    ". we can now introduce the _ prandtl potential _",
    "t_xz= _ y , t_yz = -_x . [ pot ] we have from ( [ pot ] ) @xmath18 which implies that the component of the force in the @xmath11 direction on the level sets of the prandtl potential , whose normal is @xmath19 , vanishes .",
    "thus any level set may act as a free boundary .",
    "it is convenient to set @xmath20 on the boundary @xmath21 . the total torque is given by t= _ b ( x t_yz - y t_xz ) dx dy = 2 _ b dx dy on the use of the divergence theorem and the boundary conditions .",
    "if @xmath22 and we use hooke s law we get t_yz= g(y + _ y w ) , t_xz= g(-x + _ x w ) . thus the prandtl potential satisfies poisson s equation + ^2y^2 = -2 g .",
    "[ poisson ] this must be solved in @xmath10 , subject to the boundary condition that @xmath20 on the boundary @xmath12 .",
    "of course poisson s equation arises in electrostatics where the electric field , and electrostatic potential @xmath23 satisfy @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the density of electric charge . in the case of prandtl s equation ( [ poisson ] ) we have @xmath27 which corresponds to constant charge density .",
    "prandtl adopted a different analogy .",
    "he regarded @xmath28 as a height function in some auxiliary three dimensional space euclidean space @xmath29 with coordinates @xmath30 then the surface is _ approximately _ of constant mean curvature such as would be adopted by a soap - film with a constant pressure difference .",
    "the torque is then proportional to the volume between the approximate soap film and the base @xmath10 .",
    "note that if the analogy were _ exact _ then the prandtl potential would satisfy the young - laplace equation _",
    "x + _ y = -2 g . [ soap ]      if the total shear stress exceeds the elastic limit @xmath31 , then the material deforms plasticly .",
    "plastic upper bound _ must be satisfied t_xz^2 + t_yz ^2 = | |^2 k^2 , [ bound ] where @xmath31 is the plastic limit and in the plastic region the prandtl potential is assumed to satisfy the _",
    "_ | |^2 = k^2 .",
    "[ eikonal ] according to _ ndai s sandpile analogy _",
    "@xcite one may regard a prandtl potential satisfying the eikonal equation ( [ eikonal ] ) as the height function @xmath23 of a sand - heap or sand - pile of constant _ angle of repose _",
    "@xmath32 located in same euclidean space @xmath33 .",
    "the strategy for solving the for @xmath23 adopted by prandtl is to erect over the base @xmath10 , a sand - pile , that is the solution @xmath34 of the eikonal equation ( [ eikonal ] ) .",
    "one then also erects the approximate soap film , that is the graph of the solution of poisson s equation ( [ poisson ] ) @xmath35 .",
    "the solution adopted by prandtl is then to take the _ minimum of @xmath36 and @xmath37 in other words , linear theory is assumed valid under the tent . _",
    "we begin by noting that the the eikonal equation ( [ eikonal ] ) may be regarded as the defining a _ wave - front , null or characteristic surface _",
    "@xmath38 where u = t- ( x , y ) = 0 [ surface ] in _",
    "@xmath39-dimensional minkowski spacetime _",
    "@xmath40 with coordinates @xmath41 and metric [ minkowski2 ] ds ^2 = dx^2 + dy ^2 - c^2 dt ^2 , where @xmath42 is the velocity of light . in other words , - ( _ t u)^2 + ( _ x u)^2 + ( _ y u ) ^2 = 0 . in general",
    ", the plastic upper bound ( [ bound ] ) must hold .",
    "however the transition between linear and plastic behaviour is observed to be smoother than the abrupt change envisaged in prandtl s theory .",
    "now ( [ bound ] ) implies that the surface @xmath43 has a normal which is non - spacelike .",
    "if inequality holds in ( [ bound ] ) then @xmath44 given by ( [ surface ] ) is a _",
    "spacelike surface_. thus one considers a smooth surface whose normal may become null , i.e. , may satisfy ( [ eikonal ] ) in a continuous fashion .",
    "it is natural therefore to replace the linear poisson equation with a non - linear equation which interpolates between the poisson equation and the eikonal equation and which has an interpretation more in keeping with the minkowski spacetime framework .",
    "on might try replacing poisson s equation by the young - laplace equation ( [ soap ] ) but this does not fit well with our interpretation the eikonal equation .",
    "a geometrically better motivated suggestion is to postulate the relativistically covariant analogue of the young - laplace equation : _ x + _ y = -2 g , [ mean ] which arises as the euler- lagrange equations of the functional _ b ( + 2 g c^2 ) dx dy .",
    "[ action ] the first term in ( [ action ] ) is the area of any spacelike surface @xmath44 with edge @xmath45 and the second the spacetime volume between @xmath46 and the spacelike hyperplane of constant time @xmath47 .",
    "it follows that ( [ mean ] ) describes a _",
    "spacelike surface of constant mean curvature in three dimensional minkowski spacetime @xmath40_. the difference in sign in the arguments inside the square roots in the denominators of ( [ soap ] ) and ( [ mean ] ) is intended to enforce the plastic bound ( [ bound ] ) .",
    "just as poisson s equation ( [ poisson ] ) has an electrostatic analogue , so does our proposed replacement ( [ mean ] ) .",
    "the equation ( [ mean ] ) and associated variational principle with functional ( [ action ] ) admit a similar physical interpretation @xcite .",
    "born and later born and infeld @xcite suggested a non - linear version of electrodynamics : a modification of maxwell s equations in which there is a maximum electric field strength . in the electrostatic situation",
    "the electric field strength @xmath48 electric induction @xmath49 and charge density @xmath26 satisfy @xmath50 in two dimensions , these equation , with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , coincide with ( [ mean ] ) and were first studied in the context of born - infeld electrostatics by pryce @xcite .",

    "the dashed curve also yields the constitutive law if we subsitute @xmath53 for the strains.,width=110 ]    if the cross section is circular , the standard case has & = & - r^2 + _ 0 , 0r + & = & -kr + + _ 0 , r > .",
    "the inner region is the prandtl regime .",
    "the outer region is the ndai s sand pile regime .",
    "the constant @xmath54 is chosen so that @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the radius of the cylinder .",
    "thus if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 and prandtl s solution is @xmath59 while if @xmath60 , then @xmath61 and the sandpile solution is conical with @xmath62 . in the born - infeld case one",
    "has a single unified formula    = ( - ) . for small @xmath63 ,",
    "we expand both square roots and recover prandtl s solution at lowest order . for large @xmath56 and hence large @xmath63",
    "we ignore the one inside the square roots and the solution approachs the conical sand pile solution",
    ". note that while @xmath64 in both solutions , in general the values of @xmath65 are not the same .",
    "the predictions of both theories are compared in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the total torque @xmath66 is given by t= 4 ( r^2 ( 1 + ) ^+ ( 1- ( 1 + r^2 ) ^ ) ) .",
    "we have ( ) ^2 - x ^2 - y^2 = .",
    "thus if we think of @xmath67 as coordinates for three dimensional @xmath68 minkowski spacetime with metric given in ( [ minkowski2 ] ) , then @xmath23 should be thought of as the time coordinate .",
