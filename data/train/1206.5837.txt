    "the long - standing debate about the existence of the odderon ( @xmath9-odd partner of the pomeron ) can be resolved definitely only by a high - energy experiment involving particle and anti - particle scattering , e.g. @xmath0 and @xmath10 scattering , in the same kinematical region .",
    "there was a single experiment of that kind , at the isr  @xcite , where the two cross sections were found to differ .",
    "the unique observation , however relies on a few data points only , and isr was shut down shortly after that experiment , leaving some doubts on the validity of the effect .",
    "moreover , the isr energies were not high enough to exclude the alternative explanation of the difference , namely due to @xmath11 exchange still noticeable at the isr in the region of the dip .",
    "this is not the case at the lhc , where the contribution from secondary trajectories can be practically excluded within the diffraction cone region . waiting for a possible future upgrade of the lhc energy down to that of the tevatron , which will enable a direct confrontation of @xmath0 and @xmath10 data ,",
    "here we analyze the available lhc data on @xmath0 scattering in a model with and without the odderon contribution .",
    "anticipating the final result , let us mention that one should not dramatize the question of the ( non)existence of the odderon : in our opinion , it exists simply because nothing forbids its existence .",
    "the only question is its parametrization and/or relative contribution with respect e.g. to the pomeron . due to the recent experiments on elastic and inelastic proton - proton scattering by the totem collaboration at the lhc  @xcite , data in a wide range , from lowest up to tev energies , both for proton - proton and antiproton - proton scattering in a wide span of transferred momenta are now available .",
    "the experiments at tev energies gives an opportunity to verify different pomeron and odderon models because the secondary reggeon contributions at these energies are small .",
    "however none of the existing models of elastic scattering was able to predict the value of the differential cross section beyond the first cone , as clearly seen in fig.4 of the totem paper @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the predictions of regge - pole models are rather qualitative , so the new experimental data always stimulate their improvement .",
    "let us remind that the isr measurements stimulated the development of multipole pomeron models , including the dipole one , that successively described the dip - bump structure and both cones of the differential cross section of hadron - hadron scattering  @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to describe high - energy diffraction peculiarities in the differential cross sections , was made by chou and yang in `` geometrical '' @xcite model , which qualitatively reproduces the @xmath5 dependence of the differential cross sections in elastic scattering , however it does not contain any energy dependence , subsequently introduced by means of regge - pole models .",
    "an example to examine the role of dipole pomeron ( dp ) , we performed the control fit for data of isr in the model of dipole pomeron ( see below ) .",
    "as result , we curtained of that the role of odderon headily grows with the height of energy .    in recent paper  @xcite",
    "we have used a simple dipole pomeron model that reproduces successfully the structure of first and second diffraction cones in @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering .",
    "the simplicity and transparency of the model enables one to control of various contributions to the scattering amplitude , in particular the interplay between the c - even and c - odd components of the amplitude , as well as their relative contribution , changing with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it was shown that , while the contribution from secondary reggeons is negligible at the lhc , the inclusion of the odderon is mandatory , even for the description of @xmath0 scattering alone . therefore the precise measurement of @xmath12 differential cross section gives a chance to distinguish various models of pomeron  @xcite and especially odderon @xcite , @xcite . to do this one needs to compare the predictions of the models .",
    "such a comparison makes sense only if the same data set is used when the parameters of the models are determined .",
    "the possible extensions of dp model include :    * the dip - bump structure typical to high - energy diffractive processes ; * non - linear regge trajectories ; * possible odderon ( odd-@xmath9 asymptotic regge exchange ) ; * compatible with @xmath13 and @xmath14 channel unitarity ;    below we suggest a simple model that can be used as a handle in studying diffraction at the lhc .",
    "it combines the simplicity of the above models approach , and goes beyond their limitations .",
    "being flexible , it can be modified according to the experimental needs or theoretical prejudice of its user and can be considered as the `` minimal model '' of high - energy scattering while its flexibility gives room for various generalizations / modifications or further developments ( e.g. unitarization , inclusion of spin degrees of freedom etc . ) . to start with , we choose the model , successfully describing @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering @xcite within the framework of the simple dipole pomeron . assuming that the role of the odderon in the second cone increases with energy , for more adequate definition of data we vary the form of the odderon . being limited in our choice , we will chose an odderon copying many features of the pomeron , e.g. its trajectory being non - linear .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the spinless case of the invariant high - energy scattering amplitude , @xmath15 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the usual mandelstam variables .",
    "the basic assumptions of the model are :    \\1 .",
    "the scattering amplitude is a sum of four terms , two asymptotic ( pomeron ( p ) and odderon ( o ) ) and two non - asymptotic ones or secondary regge pole contributions",
    ". where @xmath16 and @xmath17 have positive @xmath9-parity , thus entering in the scattering amplitude with the same sign in @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering , while the odderon and @xmath11 have negative @xmath9-parity , thus entering @xmath0 and @xmath10 scattering with opposite signs , as shown below : @xmath18,\\ ] ] where the symbols @xmath19 stand for the relevant regge - pole amplitudes and the super(sub)script , evidently , indicate @xmath20 scattering with the relevant choice of the signs in the sum ( [ eq : amplitude ] ) .",
    "we treat the odderon , the @xmath9-odd counterpart of the pomeron on equal footing , differing by its @xmath21 parity and the values of its parameters ( to be fitted to the data ) .",
    "we examined also a fit to @xmath0 scattering alone , without any odderon contribution .",
    "the ( negative ) result is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : odderon ] ;    \\3 .",
    "the main subject of our study is the pomeron and the odderon , as a double poles , or dp @xcite ) lying on a nonlinear trajectory , whose intercept is not equal to one .",
    "this choice is motivated by the unique properties of the dp : it produces logarithmically rising total cross sections at unit pomeron intercept . by letting @xmath22 we allow for a faster rise of the total cross section ,",
    "although the intercept is about half that in the dl model since the double pole ( or dipole ) itself drives the rise in energy .",
    "a supercritical pomeron trajectory , @xmath23 in the dp is required by the observed rise of the ratio @xmath24 or , equivalently , departure form geometrical scaling @xcite .",
    "the dipole pomeron produces logarithmically rising total cross sections and nearly constant ratio of @xmath25 at unit pomeron intercept , @xmath26 in addition this mild logarithmic increase of @xmath27 does not supported by the result of the last experiment at lhc for energy 7 tev @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "along with the rise of the ratio @xmath25 beyond the sps energies requires a supercritical dp intercept , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a small parameter @xmath31 .",
    "thus dp is about `` twice softer '' then that of donnachie - landshoff @xcite , in which @xmath32 due to its geometric form ( see below ) the dp reproduces itself against unitarity ( eikonal ) corrections . as a consequence , these corrections are small , and one can use the model at the `` born level '' without complicated ( and ambiguous ) unitarity ( rescattering ) corrections .",
    "dp combines the properties of regge poles and of the geometric approach , initiated by chou and yang , see @xcite .",
    "regge trajectories are non - linear complex functions .",
    "this nonlinearity is manifest e.g. as the `` break '' i.e. a change the slope @xmath33 gev@xmath3 around @xmath34 gev@xmath3 and at large @xmath35 , beyond the second maximum we observe nonzero curvature at least for wide @xmath36 region . in spite of a great varieties of models for high - energy diffraction ( for a recent review see @xcite ) , only a few of them attempted to attack the complicated and delicate mechanism of the diffraction structure . in the 80-ies and early 90-ies ,",
    "dp was fitted to the isr , sps and tevatron data , see @xcite and @xcite for earlier references .",
    "now we find it appropriate to revise the state of the art in this field , to update the earlier fits , analyze the ongoing measurements at the lhc and/or make further predictions .",
    "we revise the existing estimates of the pomeron and particularly odderon contributions to the cross sections as a functions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 and argue that while the contribution from non - leading trajectories in the nearly forward region is negligible ( smaller than the experimental uncertainties ) , the odderon may be important , especially beyond the first cone .",

    "first of all we check the possible best fit for forward scattering , i.e. fitting the total cross section @xmath66 and @xmath67 for well the established set of this type of data @xcite plus the new measurement at 7 tev @xcite .",
    "the quality of the fit is not worse then the standard compete fit @xcite although we apply the best global fit ( minimal @xmath63 ) as a formal criterion for the valid description , we are primarily interested in the region beyond the first cone , critical for the identification of the assumed odderon at tev energies . as mentioned in the introduction , we perform also a fit to @xmath0 data alone , see the previous section , to see whether the observed dynamics of dip can be reproduced by the pomeron alone . the contribution to the global @xmath63 from tiny effects , such as the small-@xmath35 `` break '' in the first ( and second ) cone , possible oscillations in the slope of the cone(s ) etc",
    ". should not corrupt the study of the dynamics in the dip - bump region .",
    "the following kinematical regions and relevant datasets were involved in the fitting procedure : 23 , 32 , 45 , 53 , 62 gev and 7 tev for @xmath0 scattering @xcite and 31 , 53 , 62 , 546 , 630 gev , 1,8 tev and 1,96 tev for @xmath65 scattering @xcite .",
    "these datasets were compiled in a in  @xcite .",
    "the differential elastic scattering cross sections were further constrained to cover the momentum transfer range @xmath680.05  15 gev@xmath3 .",
    "next , we included in the fit the differential cross sections in first cone chosen , somewhat subjectively for @xmath69 along with forward data , to determine the remaining parameters of the reggeons and the pomeron,@xmath70 for reggeons , @xmath71 and @xmath72 for the pomeron , important in first cone . among the parameters of the previous fit we fixed the parameters responsible for rise of the total cross section .",
    "we performed two series of fits : with linear pomeron trajectory ( @xmath73 ) and with a nonlinear one ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "for the grand total of   600 experimental points for the linear trajectory the quality of fit is better for about 70 percent in second case .",
    "it is obvious that the nonlinearity of pomeron trajectory plays a noticeable role .",
    "the presence of a non - negligible curvature in the first cone slope can be clearly seen with the help of the local slope procedure ( see , for example , fig.(8 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting fits are presented in table 1 . and fig .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we note that the best fit to the data does not necessarily implies the best physical model , but the opposite statement is always true .",
    "a basic problem in studying the pomeron and odderon is their identification i.e. their discrimination from other contributions .",
    "although this procedure is model - dependent , we try to do this possibly in a general way .",
    "we try to answer the important question : where ( in @xmath4 and in @xmath5 ) and to what extent will be the elastic data from the lhc dominated by the pomeron and odderon contribution ?",
    "the answer to this question is of practical importance since , by regge - factorization , it can be used in other diffractive processes , such as diffraction dissociation .",
    "it is also of conceptual interest in our definition and understanding of the phenomenon of high - energy diffraction .",
    "it ensues from our analysis that the dipole model of pomeron and odderon unambiguously follows , that at high ( tev ) energies the pomeron prevails in the first cone , while in the second one the odderon is dominated , interference of which at least qualitatively describes the dip in @xmath0-differential cross section and accordingly the plateau in the @xmath75 ( see fig  [ fig : htbp ]  ) .",
    "the aim of the present paper was to trace the pomeron and odderon contribution under conditions accessible within lhc kinematics .",
    "this was feasible due to the simplicity of the model , which has the important property of reproducing itself ( approximately ) against unitarity ( absorption ) corrections , that are small anyway ( for more details see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we have presented the `` minimal version '' of the dp model .",
    "it can be further extended , refined and improved , while its basic features remain intact .",
    "the anticipated rescaling of the lhc energy down to that of the highest teavatron energy may provide a definite answer to the questions concerning the odderon in @xmath0 vs. @xmath10 scattering , raised in the present paper .",
