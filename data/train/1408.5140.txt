    "determining the vacuum of an interacting field theory or the ground state of a strongly interacting quantum system described by a local translational invariant hamiltonian is one of the most fundamental and challenging tasks in quantum many - body physics .",
    "once obtained  possibly in some variational way  how much information about the hamiltonian is then encoded within the ground state ? we will demonstrate that it is possible to extract many low - energy features of the hamiltonian by just having access to the ground state .",
    "this is possible due to the hamiltonian being a sum of ( quasi- ) local terms ; this locality is the key to uncovering the mysteries of quantum many - body systems , such as the presence of a finite group velocity in quantum lattice systems , known as the lieb - robinson bound @xcite , and the relation between the spectral gap and correlation length @xcite .",
    "the latter result connects a single characteristic of the static correlation functions of the ground state to one particular excitation energy .",
    "this work continues along this line by investigating to what extent information about the _ full _ dispersion relations of the different elementary excitations of the model is encoded within the ground state and its correlations . throughout the paper",
    "we assume translation - invariant hamiltonians , such that excited states can always be characterized by momentum .",
    "any statement regarding the spectrum of a hamiltonian is to be interpreted up to an overall energy scaling and a constant energy shift . the shift is typically chosen such that the ground state energy @xmath0 .",
    "the overall energy scale is represented by a characteristic velocity ( e.g. the lieb - robinson velocity related to the norm of the hamiltonian terms , or some spin - wave velocity ) in the system .    in theory ,",
    "the full dispersion relation can be reproduced from the ground state if the map between a local hamiltonian and its corresponding ground state is bijective . for _ strictly _ @xmath1-local hamiltonians , i.e. hamiltonians for which every term acts only on a finite number @xmath1 of neighboring sites , such a bijective relation is generically obtained . there",
    "the @xmath1-site reduced density matrices ( rdms ) of ground states represent extreme points in the convex set of all possible @xmath1-site rdms .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be represented as a hyperplane in the space of such rdms , and the energy will necessarily be minimized for an extreme point in this set .",
    "each of these points uniquely determines an @xmath1-local parent hamiltonian via the tangent space to the boundary at this point , if the boundary is smooth there @xcite .",
    "this argument is however of very limited practical use as it is computationally virtually infeasible to characterize this convex set @xcite .",
    "also , the uniqueness is only obtained by restricting to a class of @xmath1-local hamiltonians and there might exist other @xmath2-local ( with @xmath3 ) or quasi - local hamiltonians for which this is the exact ground state .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is thus to identify which features of all those hamiltonians can be captured in the ground state and its correlations .",
    "we follow a more practical approach based on local information contained within the ground state , which is naturally accessible through a tensor network representation of the same . a central local object arising in tensor network simulations",
    "is the tensor network transfer matrix ( defined in section  [ s : tm ] ) .",
    "indeed , the main motivation for this work originates from numerical results obtained from tensor network simulations of ground states of strictly local translation invariant hamiltonians in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "there it is observed that the spectrum of the transfer matrix exhibits a very peculiar structure , from which certain information about the low energy excitation spectrum of the underlying hamiltonian can be extracted .",
    "these results are presented and discussed in section  [ s : numerics ] for a set of prototypical quantum models on lattices in one and two dimensions , as well as ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theories .",
    "we provide several arguments for explaining these observations in section  [ s : statcorr ] . there",
    "we argue how the structure of the eigenvalue spectrum of the transfer matrix allows to reproduce the expected form of correlation functions in gapped quantum states and use the single mode approximation to relate these eigenvalues to excited states of the hamiltonian .",
    "we also show the converse , i.e. that the excited states of the hamiltonian affect the static correlations functions , either by employing arguments from relativistic theories or by using momentum filtering to refine the celebrated proof of hastings in @xcite for the relation between gap and correlation length .",
    "in section  [ s : qtm ] we follow an alternative approach by directly connecting the transfer matrix in the context of tensor network states to the exact quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) @xcite at zero temperature , which appears in path - integral formulations of partition functions or ground states of quantum systems .",
    "tensor network methods for studying such transfer matrices have been successful since the invention of the transfer matrix renormalization group ( tmrg ) method to simulate classical models in two @xcite and higher dimensions @xcite . invoking a quantum - to - classical mapping",
    ", this method has later been generalized and used to simulate one - dimensional quantum models at finite temperature @xcite and recently to also include real time evolution @xcite . in these methods ,",
    "the object which is approximated by a tensor network is the ( quantum ) transfer matrix itself . in this work",
    "however , we investigate the transfer matrix at zero temperature generated by a tensor network approximation of the _ ground state_. we also explain how the renormalization group ( rg ) allows to interpret the mps - tm as a compressed version of the qtm .",
    "more specifically , in section  [ ss : rg ] we demonstrate how wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) for impurity systems  or its recent reformulation using the multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) @xcite  allows to build an mps approximation of the ground state with finite bond dimension @xmath4 from the qtm .",
    "this construction yields a novel connection between tensor network states and rg methods .",
    "in this section we define the regular and mixed transfer matrix ( tm ) for matrix product states ( mps ) @xcite on one dimensional lattice systems and continuous matrix product states ( cmps ) @xcite on ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theories respectively . in the context of higher - dimensional lattice systems described by",
    "projected entangled pair states ( peps ) @xcite we consider two - dimensional lattice systems on cylinders . there",
    "we obtain an effective one - dimensional lattice system by blocking sites on rings around the cylinder as described in section  [ ss : tm ] .",
    "as we are interested in bulk properties of quantum systems , we will generally work in the thermodynamic limit , where for gapped one - dimensional quantum lattice systems , a good approximation of the ground state can be obtained by using a uniform mps ansatz with finite bond dimension @xmath4 @xmath5}=\\sum_{\\{\\mathbf{s}\\}}\\bi{v}_{l}^{\\dagger}\\big(\\prod_{j\\in\\mathbb{z}}a^{s_{j}}\\big)\\bi{v}_{r}\\ket{\\{\\mathbf{s}\\ } } ,   \\label{eq : umps}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is a set of @xmath7 matrices @xmath8 containing all variational parameters defining the state , @xmath9 labels states within the @xmath7-dimensional local hilbert space on each site and @xmath10 labels sites on the lattice . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are boundary vectors which have no effect on bulk properties . an optimal mps representation of the ground state can readily be calculated using variational uniform mps techniques @xcite . for ground states of higher - dimensional lattice systems",

    "the algorithm of @xcite can be adapted accordingly .",

    "such states can be transformed into each other by applying symmetry operations of the broken symmetry .    in the ground state of a one - dimensional quantum system , continuous symmetries for which the order parameter does not commute with the hamiltonian",
    "can not be spontaneously broken @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , close to or within a gapless phase with a continuous symmetry , it is sometimes energetically favorable for a variational ( c)mps approximation of the ground state to break this symmetry and to approximate an excited state with very small excitation energy and much smaller entanglement instead .",
    "this pseudo symmetry breaking is purely an effect of finite bond dimension and also gives rise to a pseudo order parameter @xcite .",

    "let @xmath39 and @xmath48 be mps approximations of two ground states with the same variational energy but different order parameters and maximally broken symmetry .",
    "the orthogonality of these states requires that the fidelity per lattice site must be strictly smaller than one , i.e. the spectral radius of the mixed transfer matrix @xmath49 .",
    "equivalently , for continuum systems we define the ( generator of the ) mixed cmps transfer matrix as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are two different cmps representations . similar to the lattice case , if @xmath51 and @xmath52 describe two equally good ground state approximations with the same variational energy , but with different order parameters and maximum symmetry breaking , the spectrum @xmath53 has strictly negative real parts .",
    "the degeneracy of the ground state in phases with broken symmetries gives rise to topologically nontrivial excitations ( kinks or domain walls ) , which typically correspond to the elementary excitations of the model .",
    "the mixed ( c)mps - tm of type ( [ eq : mixedmpstm ] ) or ( [ eq : mixedcmpstm ] ) of these symmetry broken ground states plays a crucial role in obtaining a variational approximation for such excitations , whereas the regular ( c)mps - tm of type ( [ eq : mpstm ] ) or ( [ eq : cmpstm ] ) is the central object for topologically trivial excitations @xcite .",
    "this section illustrates and discusses typical spectra of the regular and mixed ( c)mps - tm of obtained ( c)mps ground state approximations and compares it to low energy excitations for several quantum models of interest . for the eigenvalues of the ( c)mps - tm we write @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the complex argument .",
    "this form already suggests that the @xmath57 will be related to some characteristic energies of the model , as motivated throughout the remainder of this paper .",

    "there the peculiar structure of the tm eigenvalue spectrum is however also different from normal situations as investigated in section  [ s : numerics ] , which can serve as an indicator for such exceptional situations .      in the previous two subsections ,",
    "we have discussed two effects of the peculiar distribution of the eigenvalues of the mps - tm .",
    "firstly , the clustering of eigenvalues onto lines starting from the origin allows to recover the typical form of static correlation functions in gapped quantum ground states in the limit @xmath47 .",
    "secondly , this distribution causes peaks in the static structure factor , which can be related to minima in the dispersion relation of excitations using the single mode approximation .",
    "in retrospect , the first effect only requires a dense distribution of eigenvalues along a line , without any connection between the location of these lines and the dispersion relation of the excitations of the system .",
    "the second argument only requires the existence of a single dominant eigenvalue with a phase corresponding to the momentum of the minimum of the dispersion relation , and does not explain why there needs to be a dense distribution of eigenvalues .",
    "this leaves open the question whether a different structure of the eigenvalue distribution could give rise to similar effects .",
    "put differently , we would like to answer the reverse question , i.e. to what extent are static correlation functions and the clustering of the eigenvalues of the mps - tm determined by the excited states of the hamiltonian .    for lorentz - invariant field theories ,",
    "the klln - lehmann representation of two - point correlation functions provides such a direct connection to the excitation spectrum of the hamiltonian .",
    "whereas the klln - lehmann representation exists for arbitrary dynamical correlation functions , we here specialize to the case of static correlation functions between two scalar operators @xmath323 and @xmath324 , where it is given by @xmath325 where  contrary to standard field theory notation ",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath31 denote spatial vectors , @xmath124 denotes momentum and @xmath7 represents the number of spatial dimensions .",
    "the first integral is over all possible masses in the theory , and @xmath326 corresponds to the density of states . if the lowest lying excitations correspond to single particle excitations with discrete masses @xmath327 , then @xmath326 will contain a contribution @xmath328 .",
    "the state @xmath329 corresponds to the presence of such an excitation with mass @xmath330 and momentum zero .",
    "let us again restrict to the case of @xmath331 .",
    "we are interested in the long - range behavior of correlation functions in a lattice model , which is clearly dictated by the low - energy behavior of the model .",
    "if this low - energy behavior can be captured by a lorentz - invariant theory with masses @xmath330 , a remnant of the klln - lehmann representation of correlation functions should exist in the lattice model .",
    "for the field theory , the minimum of all dispersion relations is at momentum zero .",
    "however , in many cases taking the continuum limit of a lattice theory requires that e.g. @xmath332 sites are blocked , and a single lattice dispersion relation with several minima for momenta @xmath333 with @xmath334 gives rise to @xmath332 independent dispersion relations of the field theory .",
    "a prototypical example for @xmath335 is the xx - model , which corresponds to the staggered fermion discretization of relativistic dirac fermions , where the two components of the dirac spinor are put on even and odd sites respectively @xcite .    equation ( [ eq : kallenlehmann ] ) represents the static correlation function in real space as an integral over momentum space .",
    "the corresponding representation for the static structure factor in momentum space can therefore easily be identified . in the lorentz - invariant case ,",
    "the single particle excitations add a contribution to the static correlation function that is given by a constant times the inverse of the dispersion relation of that excitation . for typical operators",
    ", these will be the dominant contributions .",
    "if the low - energy behavior of a lattice model is lorentz - invariant , we can thus expect that @xmath276 should also receive contributions @xmath336 of the form @xmath337^{-1/2}. \\label{eq : rel_disp}\\ ] ] here , @xmath338 is a constant depending on the choice of operators @xmath21 and @xmath211 , @xmath339 is the mass of the excitations in units of the inverse lattice spacing and @xmath106 is the characteristic velocity , which for a proper lorentz - invariant low - energy behavior should be the same ( and thus independent of @xmath98 ) for all excitations .",

    "@xmath264 and @xmath425 are equal and the correlation length is directly given by the inverse of the gap in units where the speed of light @xmath463 .",
    "without lorentz - invariance , there is no obvious relation between @xmath264 and its euclidean rotation @xmath425 .",
    "the result of @xcite allows to bound @xmath207 ( and thus the gap of @xmath425 ) in terms of the gap @xmath388 of @xmath264 .",
    "when the low - energy behavior of @xmath264 still allows for an effective relativistic description , it can indeed be expected that @xmath464 where @xmath465 replaces the speed of light with some characteristic speed of the system .",
    "however , there is also the possibility of an inherently non - relativistic low energy behavior , resulting in e.g. gapless hamiltonians @xmath264 for which the ground state is an exact mps @xcite so that the corresponding @xmath425 is gapped .",
    "finally , we can obtain an alternative interpretation by applying the jamiokowski isomorphism to map the pure state defined on the infinite one - dimensional virtual system of the previous discussion to the density matrix of a half - infinite one - dimensional virtual system with a boundary at @xmath446 . by again interchanging the roles of real space and imaginary time",
    ", this half - infinite system undergoes dissipative evolution in the new time - direction @xmath32 , corresponding to a hamiltonian containing the terms of @xmath425 with support on the region @xmath466 , and additional lindblad operators corresponding to the action of @xmath425 across the boundary and the additional action of an operator @xmath201 inserted at certain `` times '' @xmath32 .",
    "hence , all the lindblad operators are acting near the boundary , and the truncation of the bond dimension corresponds to selecting the relevant degrees of freedom to describe the boundary of the system .",
    "it is a virtue of the mera that it naturally unifies the process of selecting the relevant degrees of freedom for boundaries and impurities @xcite .",
    "the resulting virtual system becomes effectively zero - dimensional , and can be interpreted as providing a holographic description of the physical system @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have investigated how much information about the excitation spectrum of a local translation invariant hamiltonian can be obtained from local information and static correlations in the ground state .",
    "we have approached this question using the formalism of tensor network states in particular , but have also established several general results not restricted to tensor network formulations .",
    "we have started by defining the regular and mixed tensor network transfer matrix for lattice and continuum models in section  [ ss : tm ] and section  [ ss : syms_mixedtm ] .",
    "we have then obtained tensor network approximations for the ground states of various prototypical quantum models on a lattice in one and two dimensions and ( 1 + 1)-dimensional field theories and studied the spectrum of eigenvalues @xmath467 of the tensor network transfer matrix in section  [ s : numerics ] .",
    "there we have observed that the the complex arguments @xmath104 of the dominant eigenvalues correspond to the momenta @xmath102 of the minima in the low energy dispersion of the system . especially for critical models",
    "one can therefore easily determine the momenta for which there exist gapless excitations directly from ground state properties .",
    "we have used this to determine the value of the fermi - momentum in the kondo lattice model studied in @xcite , where no claims for zero temperature were possible .",
    "we have also related the logarithm of the absolute values @xmath468 to the minimum excitation energies @xmath108 by some characteristic velocity @xmath469 , which can be estimated by e.g. assuming a lorentz - invariant low energy behavior ( c.f .",
    "section  [ ss : kl ] ) .",
    "these observations are of large practical importance in the context of simulating quantum many body systems using tensor network techniques : it implies that already fairly accurate information about the structure of the low energy excitation spectrum can be obtained just from a variational ground state calculation .",
    "we have demonstrated that this is especially useful for two - dimensional systems using the peps formalism , for which no other efficient methods are presently known to extract information about excited states beyond the value of the gap . in particular",
    "we have investigated the aklt model on a square and hexagonal lattice cylinder , where we have obtained a first approximation of the dispersion of the elementary excitations , for which there currently exist no other competitive numerical methods .",
    "some of the authors have subsequently used this approach to study topological phase transitions and anyon condensation in the toric code model with string tension @xcite .    in section  [ s : statcorr ]",
    "we have gathered several arguments to explain how the eigenvalue spectrum of the transfer matrix affect the low - energy excitations of the model and vice versa .",
    "we have explained how a clustering of eigenvalues along lines of constant complex phase allows to recover the ornstein - zernike form of correlations in gapped phases if the distribution of eigenvalues becomes sufficiently dense in the limit @xmath47 in section  [ ss : oz ] .",
    "using the single mode approximation and a recent proof about the locality of elementary excitations @xcite , we have argued why the phase of the eigenvalues along these lines correspond to minima of the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations in those models in section  [ ss : sma ] .",
    "there we have also discussed that the full spectrum of the transfer matrix generally contains more information than static correlation functions of specific operators , as the transfer matrix is completely independent of the choice of operators . to approach this connection from the reverse direction in section  [ ss : kl ] , we have first called on the assumption of a lorentz - invariant low - energy behavior to identify the spectrum of the transfer matrix with a discrete version of the klln - lehmann representation of correlation functions .",
    "finally , in section  [ ss : corr_momentum ] we have introduced momentum - resolved correlation functions by defining gaussian wave - packets of operators centered around a certain momentum @xmath124 in order to obtain a momentum resolved refinement of the celebrated result of hastings @xcite relating the correlation length in the system to the gap of the hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore we have identified the _ tensor network transfer matrix _ of an exact tensor network representation of the ground state with the _ quantum transfer matrix _ , appearing in path integral formulations of partition functions or ground states of quantum many - body systems , in section  [ ss : imtime ] .",
    "we have then argued how the quantum transfer matrix is related to the original hamiltonian for system with and without lorentz - invariance in section  [ ss : qtm_ham ] .",
    "we have demonstrated that for systems without lorentz - invariance the quantum transfer matrix can be written in terms of an effective hamiltonian with effective parameters which are related to the original hamiltonian .",
    "these parameters can in principle also be complex , thus yielding non - hermitian effective hamiltonians and non - hermitian transfer matrices . for systems with commensurate order",
    ", a hermitian effective hamiltonian can be obtained by blocking several sites in constructing the transfer matrix .",
    "based on this construction some of the authors have subsequently obtained an analytic form of such an exact mps ground state representation for the case of the @xmath422 xy model in @xcite .    as a final point we have demonstrated in section  [ ss : rg ] how a tensor network approximation of the ground state with finite bond dimension @xmath4 can be obtained from the exact quantum transfer matrix through a renormalization process where the physical system acts as an impurity .",
