    "jovian trojans are actually large populations of minor bodies in the 1:1 mean motion resonance ( mmr ) with jupiter , librating around @xmath1 and @xmath3 lagrangian points . in general , there are two classes of theories explaining their origin : i ) a theory in the framework of accretion model ( e.g. goldreich 2004 , lyra et al .",
    "2009 ) and ii ) a capture of bodies located in libration zones during a migration of giant planets ( morbidelli et al .",
    "2005 , morbidelli et al .",
    "2010 , nesvorn et al .",
    "2013 ) , which is preferred in our solar system . since the librating regions are very stable in the current configuration of planets and they are surrounded by strongly chaotic separatrices , bodies from other source regions ( e.g. main belt , centaurs , jupiter family comets ) can not otherwise enter the libration zones and jupiter trojans thus represent a rather primitive and isolated population .    several recent analyses confirmed the presence of several families among trojans ( e.g. nesvorn et al .",
    "2015 , vinogradova , 2015 ) .",
    "the trojan region as such is very favourable for dynamical studies of asteroid families , because there is no significant systematic yarkovsky drift in semimajor axis due to the resonant dynamics . on the other hand",
    ", we have to be aware of boundaries of the libration zone , because ballistic transport can cause a partial depletion of family members . at the same time , as we have already shown in bro & rozehnal ( 2011 ) , no family can survive either late phases of a slow migration of jupiter , or jupiter `` jump '' , that results from relevant scenarios of the nice model ( morbidelli et al .",
    "we thus focus on post - migration phase in this paper .",
    "we feel the need to evaluate again our previous conclusions on even larger datasets , that should also allow us to reveal as - of - yet unknown structures in the space of proper elements or unveil possible relations between orbital and physical properties ( e.g. albedos , colours , diameters ) of jovian trojans .    in section [ sec : obsdata ]",
    "we use new observational data to compute appropriate resonant elements . in section",
    "[ sec : physchar ] we use albedos obtained by grav et al .",
    "( 2012 ) to derive size - frequency distributions and distribution of albedos , which seem to be slightly dependent on the proper inclination @xmath5 . in section [ sec : groups ] we identify families among trojans with our new `` randombox '' method .",
    "we discuss properties of statistically significant families in section [ sec : props ] . then we focus mainly on the hektor family because of its unique d  type taxonomical classification , which is the first of its kind .",
    "we also discuss its long - term dynamical evolution . in section [ sec : coll_model ] we simulate collisional evolution of trojans and we estimate the number of observable families among trojans .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : sph ] we simulate an origin of the hektor family using smoothed - particle hydrodynamics and we compare results for single and bilobed targets .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this paper , we updated the list of trojans and their proper elements , what allowed us to update parameters of trojan families and to discover a new one ( namely @xmath2 in @xmath3 population )",
    ". we focused on the hektor family , which seems the most interesting due to the bilobed shape of the largest remnant with a small moon and also its d - type taxonomical classification , which is unique among the collisional families observed so far .    at the current stage of knowledge",
    ", it seems to us there are no major inconsistencies among the observed number of trojan families and their dynamical and collisional evolution , at least in the current environment .    as usual",
    ", we `` desperately '' need new observational data , namely in the size range from 5 to 10 km , which would enable us to constrain the ages of asteroid families on the basis of collisional modeling and to decide between two proposed ages of hektor family , 1  to  4  gyr or 0.1  to  2.5  gyr .",
    "as expected , there are qualitative differences in impacts on single and bilobed targets . in our setup",
    ", the shockwave does not propagate easily into the secondary , so that only one half the mass is totally damaged as one can see in figure [ fig : sph ] . on the other hand , the resulting sfds are not that different , as we would expect .",
    "even so , there is a large parameter space , which is still not investigated ( i.e. the impact geometry with respect to the secondary , secondary impacts , the position in the orbit ) .",
    "sph simulations of impacts on bilobed or binary targets thus seem very worthy for future research .",
    "our work is also a strong motivation for research of disruptions of weak bodies ( e.g. comets ) , better understanding the cometary disruption scaling law and also for experimental determination of material constants , which appear in the respective equation of state .    as a curiosity",
    ", we can also think of searching for the remaining projectile , which could be still present among trojans on a trajectory substantially different from that of family .",
    "a substantial part of projectile momentum is preserved in our simulations , so we may turn the logic and we may assume the projectile most likely came from the trojan region and then it should remain in this region too .",
    "we thank alessandro morbidelli for his review which helped to improve the final version of the paper .    the work of mb was supported by the grant no .",
