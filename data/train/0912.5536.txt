    "recently , cdms ii  @xcite has just finished , while xenon 1 t , supercdms , and xmass  @xcite are planed .",
    "direct dm searches have been done by looking for the elastic scattering of wimp with target nuclei through nuclear recoil .",
    "higgs - boson - exchange processes mainly lead to scalar ( in other words , spin - independent ( sm ) ) couplings between nuclei and wimp .",

    "a class of models is categorized as `` higgs portal dark matter '' , in which a dm particle interacts with standard model ( sm ) particles through only higgs exchange processes .",
    "the minimal model was constructed by adding only one new @xmath0 parity - odd real scalar field to the sm  @xcite .",
    "a variety of such models has been proposed  @xcite . some of them are motivated in the context of radiative seesaw models  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable but common feature of higgs portal dm models is the invisible decay of the higgs boson due to higgs - dm couplings for the case that the dm mass is smaller than one half of the higgs boson mass  @xcite . in the minimal higgs portal dm model ,",
    "the upper bound is obtained for the branching ratio of the invisible decay from the new cdms ii results  @xcite .    in this letter , we study a @xmath0-odd scalar higgs portal dm scenario in the framework of multi - higgs doublet models .",
    "such a scenario can appear , for example , in the effective theory of the three - loop - induced neutrino mass model  @xcite , in which not only tiny neutrino masses but also dm as well as baryon asymmetry may be explained simultaneously by the tev scale physics .",
    "the upper bound on the branching ratio of the higgs boson invisible decay is evaluated in the model with two higgs doublets and a real @xmath0-odd singlet scalar field under the cdms ii results . in the analysis , a specific yukawa interaction ( the type - x yukawa interaction  @xcite )",
    "is employed , which is used in ref .",
    "@xcite and is defined under the other ( softly broken ) discrete symmetry ( @xmath1 ) for avoiding flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) .",
    "we also give a comment on the results assuming the other types of yukawa interaction , such as so - called type - ii .",
