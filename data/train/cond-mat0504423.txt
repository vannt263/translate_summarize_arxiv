    "due to its comparative simplicity , the short range bimodal @xmath0 ising system is a widely studied model of a spin glass .",
    "the hamiltonian is of the form proposed by edwards and anderson @xcite    @xmath1    where the nearest - neighbor exchange interactions @xmath2 are quenched random variables of fixed magnitude but random sign .",
    "these bonds are negative with a probability @xmath3 $ ] for the square lattice .",
    "the canonical model with @xmath4 on the square lattice has been studied the most and it is well accepted that spin glass behavior occurs at zero temperature @xcite , and persists down to a critical probability @xmath5 of about @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "one of the compelling features of the 2-dimensional ising model is the special property of allowing exact solutions - at least for finite systems in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "a number of authors have taken this approach in various guises @xcite .",
    "one advantage of doing so is that it provides a direct access to the ground state properties without the need to extrapolate from finite temperatures as is necessary , for example , in monte carlo based methods .",
    "good agreement for the values of the ground state energy and entropy is obtained by the various workers . however , to the present , there has been very little development in extending the methodology to a direct calculation of the spin correlations at zero temperature , and most of the results have come from extrapolations from finite temperatures .",
    "the present authors developed an approach @xcite , based on the pfaffian matrix , that appears to capture the essence of the physics of the @xmath0 system .",
    "the algorithm enables certain quantities such as the ground state free energy and entropy to be calculated exactly for very large lattices .",
    "the objective of the current paper is to extend that methodology to give direct access to the zero temperature correlation functions .",
    "spin correlations for the bimodal ising spin glass are expected to decay algebraically according to    @xmath7_{av}\\sim r^{-\\eta } \\label{e : ss1}\\ ] ]    at the critical temperature . in practice ,",
    "finite size effects dictate that the spin correlations will decay exponentially    @xmath7_{av}\\sim r^{-\\eta } \\exp(-r/\\xi ) \\label{e : ss2}\\ ] ]    where the correlation length @xmath8 is expected to be proportional to the system size if the latter is large enough .    to our knowledge",
    "the only direct computations of spin correlation functions in the ground state are those of ozeki @xcite .",
    "this work used a numerical transfer matrix method with long thin samples of circumference @xmath9 wrapped around a cylinder of length @xmath10 with open ends .",
    "the maximum possible circumference for this study was only @xmath11 , a consequence of the transfer matrix computational requirements scaling exponentially with @xmath9 .",
    "all other attempts to study spin correlations in the ground state have involved extrapolation from finite temperature .",
    "monte carlo techniques have been employed to obtain results for low temperatures , for example @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , it has never been clear just how reliable these extrapolations are .",
    "the transfer matrix method has also been used to obtain spin correlations functions at finite temperature @xcite , although the sample shape restrictions are severe with cylindrical circumference @xmath14 .",
    "a better approach is probably the network model @xcite where the computational requirements scale as @xmath15 , not exponentially .",
    "nevertheless , although larger values of @xmath9 are feasible , the zero temperature limit is inaccessible .",
    "the algorithm we employ depends only on the number and distribution of frustrated plaquettes .",
    "this means that there is no need for the cylindrical circumference to be especially small and the two lattice dimensions can be treated on an essentially equal footing .",
    "although this algorithm is related in some formalities to the network model , it is especially designed to operate in the ground state .",
    "the method is also fully gauge invariant .",
    "this means that it is well suited for the determination of gauge invariant quantities . in this context , a transformation of disorder is gauge invariant if the number and distribution of frustrated plaquettes is unchanged .",
    "examples of gauge invariant quantities are energy , entropy and the squares of correlation functions .",
    "in contrast , matching algorithms @xcite , although more efficient , can not determine more than the energy .",
    "the formalism is developed in section 2 , and is then used in section 3 for the evaluation of @xmath16 for the canonical @xmath0 model .",
    "the planar ising model has long been analytically accessible since it can be mapped onto a system of non - interacting fermions .",
    "this mapping can take various forms , including the transfer matrix and combinatorial methods .",
    "the combinatorial , or pfaffian , method @xcite is particularly well suited to the study of disordered planar ising systems .",
    "essentially , each lattice site is decorated with four fermions which have interactions across bonds as well as intrasite interactions .",
    "the partition function for a disordered planar ising model can be expressed in the form    @xmath17 \\hspace { 2 mm } ( \\det d)^{1/2 } \\label{e : z}\\ ] ]    where the product is over all nearest neighbor bonds @xmath2 on the @xmath18 site lattice and @xmath19 is a skew - symmetric matrix",
    ". the square root of the determinant of @xmath19 is the major feature and is precisely the pfaffian @xcite .",
    "it is also proportional to the trace over all closed lattice polygons , that is    @xmath20    where @xmath21 .",
    "the correlation functions can be expressed within the same formalism as a reciprocal defect problem @xcite .",
    "we choose a path between a pair of spins and replace @xmath22 with @xmath23 for bonds on that path .",
    "it may be noted here that the path can also be disjoint , in which case the formalism would give a correlation function for four or more spins . in terms of determinants",
    ", the correlation function can be easily expressed as    @xmath24    where the matrix @xmath25 is the same as @xmath19 except for the reciprocal defects .",
    "the calculation of the partition function for the disordered ising model has been described before @xcite .",
    "the key points are as follows . at zero temperature",
    ", @xmath19 is a singular matrix with zero eigenvalues equal in number to the number of frustrated plaquettes .",
    "these eigenvalues ( which occur in pairs ) approach zero as some power of @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is an integer . the ground state energy and entropy can be expressed exactly as    @xmath29    @xmath30    the sums are over all zero eigenstates .",
    "an algorithm based on degenerate state perturbation theory was developed @xcite to evaluate exactly the @xmath28 and @xmath31 , and hence the ground state energy and entropy . in this paper",
    "we show how to extend this algorithm to the correlation functions as well .",
    "it was found @xcite to be convenient to transform the lattice fermions from the sites to the bonds . in this way",
    ", we can associate two fermions with each bond and , on the square lattice , four fermions with each plaquette .",
    "figure [ f : fig1 ] provides an illustration .",
    "a simple generalization to another planar lattice has proved straightforward @xcite .",
    "a plaquette showing how lattice fermions are associated with bonds and plaquettes.,width=321 ]    for the @xmath0 model in particular we write    @xmath32    where @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "this equation is exact and @xmath35 characterizes a perturbation away from the singular matrix @xmath36 and has nonzero matrix elements only across bonds .",
    "the singularities of @xmath36 arise due to the frustration . for each frustrated plaquette",
    ", @xmath36 has a zero eigenvalue with an eigenvector localized on the four associated fermions . to determine the ground state properties , it is necessary to determine the defect eigenvalues of @xmath19 , that is those eigenvalues that are zero at zero temperature .",
    "first @xmath35 is diagonalized in the basis of the defect eigenvectors localized on the frustrated plaquettes .",
    "the second order calculation then involves diagonalizing    @xmath37    in the basis of the eigenvectors corresponding to zero eigenvalues at first order .",
    "this process is continued order by order where , for @xmath38 ,    @xmath39    until no zero eigenvalues remain . in these equations",
    ", @xmath40 is the continuum propagator and @xmath41 is the propagator for eigenstates determined at order @xmath42 @xcite .    the matrix @xmath25 is given by    @xmath43    where @xmath44 for matrix elements across a path bond .",
    "all other elements of @xmath45 are zero .",
    "this equation is easily derived by expanding @xmath46 in powers of @xmath47 . since @xmath48 in the ground state ,",
    "we can now state our main task as the computation of the limit    @xmath49_{t=0}=\\lim_{\\delta\\rightarrow 0 } \\frac{\\det c}{\\det d } \\label{e : limit}\\ ] ]    to achieve this goal efficiently , we have discovered a remarkable property of the continuum propagator .",
    "it can be written as the sum of two terms    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is @xmath52 block diagonal in the four fermions associated within a plaquette and @xmath53 is @xmath54 block diagonal in the two fermions associated with a bond .",
    "the physical relevance of this decomposition can be realized in that @xmath53 should not play any role in the ground state , being only an issue for excited states .",
    "both @xmath53 and @xmath35 are bond diagonal , meaning that @xmath55 costs energy while taking us nowhere .",
    "we can now state an important theorem concerning the determination of @xmath56 .    * theorem . * _ in the ground state limit , the solution for _ @xmath56 _ using _",
    "@xmath57 _ is exactly the same as the solution using _",
    "@xmath58    essentially , the effects of @xmath53 exactly cancel the awkward nonlinear terms in @xmath47 .",
    "we can simply rerun the perturbation theory for @xmath59 instead of @xmath35 , noting that this simply requires a sign change across path bonds .",
    "further , there is an obvious corollary that says that @xmath53 can be simply ignored while computing @xmath60 .",
    "the continuum propagator is really just @xmath51 and is localized inside plaquettes .",
    "the physical sense of this is clear .",
    "a proof of the theorem is given in the appendix .    in @xcite it was proven that @xmath60 is proportional to the ground state degeneracy ( equation ( [ e : s ] ) is an equivalent statement ) . we can generalize this by considering @xmath56 as proportional to an effective degeneracy for the reciprocal defect system .",
    "in fact we can usually write    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the system entropy and @xmath63 is the analog for the reciprocal defect system .",
    "this result applies unless the effective energy of the reciprocal defect system is less than the actual energy in which case the correlation function is zero .",
    "we are not aware of this result appearing elsewhere in the literature . as a function of system size @xmath9 ,",
    "the entropy is expected to vary as @xcite    @xmath64    with @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 otherwise .",
    "this same behavior is also expected with cylindrical winding , that is periodic boundary conditions applied in one dimension . from this , we can of course reasonably expect that the first cumulant approximation    @xmath68    is valid if @xmath9 is sufficiently large .",
    "this is of course in accordance with finite size scaling theory , where it is expected that @xmath69 and @xmath70 if @xmath71 is sufficiently large .",
    "the nature of higher order corrections with cylindrical winding is unclear @xcite .",
    "we have first estimated correlation functions with paths of length @xmath71 , in units of the lattice spacing , parallel to the axes of long thin cylinders of dimensions @xmath72 with @xmath11 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "ozeki @xcite used similar geometry , but the largest size treated was @xmath11 .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ f : fig2 ] .",
    "the error bars indicate uncertainties equal to two standard deviations , that is a @xmath76 per cent confidence interval .",
    "the averages are over @xmath77 random samples , except for @xmath78 where only @xmath79 samples were obtained .",
    "the uncertainties do not depend strongly on either @xmath9 or @xmath71 , only on the number of samples . with @xmath77 samples ,",
    "they all sit in the range @xmath80 to @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding interval with @xmath79 samples is @xmath82 to @xmath83 , about a factor of @xmath84 larger .",
    "the curves are fits of the data to the form    @xmath85    these @xmath86 nonlinear fits were done using the levenberg - marquardt method @xcite with the statistical uncertainties incorporated .",
    "the coefficient @xmath87 and the exponent @xmath88 are both approximately independent of @xmath9 .",
    "the values of @xmath87 are @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 respectively for @xmath11 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath16 are @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in comparison ,",
    "the correlation length @xmath8 does not vary like @xmath9 as would be expected from finite size scaling theory .",
    "in fact we find that it varies more like @xmath97 .",
    "the respective values of @xmath98 are @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "we also find that finite size corrections to the entropy for the @xmath72 system scale like @xmath103 , whereas scaling as equation ( [ e : fss ] ) applies with the @xmath104 lattice .",
    "clearly the correlation functions are intimately associated with the entropy as is highlighted in equation ( [ e : entropy ] ) .",
    "interestingly lukic et al @xcite also observe finite size corrections to the ground state entropy scaling like @xmath103 , albeit for a system with different geometry .",
    "figure [ f : fig3 ] shows the same data plotted against @xmath103 for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the @xmath86 fits are to the function @xmath107 and were first done with linearized data before polishing with nonlinear fits to obtain uncertainties for the fitting parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "a consequent fit of @xmath108 to a power function @xmath110 gives @xmath111 .",
    "we have also tried to fit the data to the form of equation ( [ e : expss ] ) .",
    "the result is certainly inferior with considerably larger @xmath86 values for @xmath112 and @xmath73 in particular , although @xmath113 does follow @xmath71 rather roughly . in detail , for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the respective values of @xmath114 are @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "we have also performed estimations of correlation functions on @xmath119 lattices .",
    "the lattices are cylindrically wound as before but the reciprocal defect path is around the circumference of the cylinder , as far as possible from the nested boundaries .",
    "figure [ f : fig4 ] shows the results for a range of values of @xmath9 up to 128 .",
    "the number of random samples taken was @xmath77 .",
    "the curves are a fit to the form of equation ( [ e : scale ] ) and serve only as a guide to the eye .",
    "the statistical uncertainties for our estimates , with @xmath77 random samples , on @xmath104 lattices are in the interval @xmath80 to @xmath81 , the same as for the @xmath120 lattices .",
    "figure [ f : fig5 ] shows data plotted against @xmath121 .",
    "the fits are to the form of equation ( [ e : expss ] ) . only data for which @xmath122 is used since it is observed that data for smaller @xmath9 sits significantly above the fit .",
    "this is most probably a consequence of the finite size effect of the cylindrical circumference",
    ". a further fit of @xmath123 to @xmath110 reveals @xmath124 which is in reasonable agreement with the values found above .",
    "earlier work on the exact calculation of the energy and entropy of the 2-dimensional @xmath0 spin glass has been extended to cover spin correlations in the ground state .",
    "the computational requirements of the algorithm depend only on the number and distribution of frustrated plaquettes , and this provides the possibility of studying quite large samples .",
    "the big advantage of the approach is that there is no need to extrapolate from finite temperatures as in monte carlo methods .",
    "our best estimate of the exponent is @xmath125 .",
    "we regard the cylindrical winding as the most reliable configuration for calculation since it provides one long dimension .",
    "this value for @xmath16 emerges from the calculation for the largest value of @xmath9 , and for the composite analysis in figure [ f : fig3 ] .",
    "the calculation on the @xmath104 lattice also yields a similar figure .",
    "a wide range of values of @xmath16 have been reported in the literature over the years .",
    "a significant number of these favor a value around @xmath126 , somewhat higher than ours , but most of these use extrapolated monte carlo data rather than focusing directly on the ground state .",
    "interestingly a recent calculation @xcite reports @xmath127 in agreement with the current calculation .",
    "although the central theorem of this article makes good physical sense , it can also be proven with mathematical rigor .",
    "this appendix outlines a proof . for present purposes ,",
    "all matrices are defined as pure imaginary hermitian , that is with real eigenvalues .                  where the eigenvalue is the @xmath134th defect eigenvalue of order @xmath42 with @xmath135 and @xmath136 is the leading term for the corresponding eigenvector , that is @xmath137 .",
    "the notation here is in keeping with @xcite .                        for @xmath148",
    ", we now use equations ( [ e : a6 ] ) and ( [ e : a8 ] ) to proceed to the second order problem .",
    "as stated in the main text , we write @xmath149 .",
    "further , it is easy to demonstrate that @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "then , defining @xmath154 , it can be shown that , for @xmath155 ,                                                            this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "clearly the assumptions ( [ e : a17 ] ) and ( [ e : a18 ] ) imply the results ( [ e : a21 ] ) and ( [ e : a22 ] ) .",
