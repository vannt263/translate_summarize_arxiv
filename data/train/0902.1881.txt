    "positive and negative feedback loops are frequently - occurring motifs in gene transcription regulatory networks and signaling pathways @xcite .",
    "the components of a feedback loop are genes , proteins and other molecules which are connected by regulatory interactions .",
    "depending on the components and their interactions , feedback loops have distinct roles in diverse regulatory systems .",
    "a regulatory interaction is positive ( negative ) if an increase in the amount or activity of one component increases ( decreases ) the amount or activity of its interaction partner .",
    "a feedback loop is positive ( negative ) if the number of repressing interactions is zero or even ( odd ) .",
    "a large number of experiments and theoretical studies elucidate the major functional characteristics of feedback loops with simple structure @xcite .",
    "positive feedback in a gene transcription regulatory network ( gtrn ) tends to enhance protein levels whereas negative feedback favours homeostasis , i.e. , maintenance of proteins at a desired level .",
    "the simplest feedback loop has only one component which is thus self - regulating .",
    "for such a motif in a gtrn , a protein promotes / represses its own production via autoactivation / autorepression of the expression of its gene .",
    "a positive feedback loop with two components and two regulatory interactions is of two types : double negative and double positive . again , considering a gtrn , the protein products of the two genes in a double negative feedback loop repress each other s synthesis .",
    "the construction of a synthetic circuit , the genetic toggle , is based on this motif @xcite .",
    "the double positive feedback loop is defined by two genes , the protein products of which promote each other s synthesis .",
    "there are several examples of two - component positive feedback loops in natural cellular networks @xcite , a prominent example being the cell division cycle , the regulatory network of which contains both double positive and double negative feedback loops @xcite . in this case",
    ", the loops control enzymatic activity .",
    "the double negative feedback loop , because of its more common occurrence , has been extensively studied in contrast to the double positive feedback loop .",
    "the next stage of complexity in feedback loops involves linked positive and negative feedback loops @xcite .",
    "the key variables in the dynamics of feedback loops are the concentrations of the component molecules . in the case of a gtrn",
    ", these may be the protein concentrations . in a deterministic description ,",
    "the time evolution of the concentrations is determined by solving a set of coupled differential equations , the number of equations being equal to the number of variables . in reality , the biochemical events associated with gene expression are probabilistic in nature and this is reflected in the presence of fluctuations ( termed noise ) around mean protein levels @xcite .",
    "a stochastic description of time evolution is thus more appropriate .",
    "a single positive feedback loop has a tendency to amplify noise , also the time taken to reach the steady state protein level is longer than that in the case of an unregulated gene @xcite .",
    "interlinking of two positive feedback loops with slow and fast dynamics results in a switch with rapid activation and slow deactivation times and a marked resistance to noise in the upstream signaling pathway @xcite .",
    "addition of a single negative feedback loop leads to rapid deactivation in the absence of the signal which activates the switch @xcite .",
    "the combination of positive and negative feedback loops may give rise to excitability with transient activation of protein levels .",
    "recent experiments suggest that competence development in b. subtilis is achieved via excitability @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the functional characteristics of a two - gene double positive feedback loop coupled with autorepression of the expression of one of the genes .",
    "the major motivation for studying this specific motif is its presence in the gtrn controlling the pancreatic @xmath0-cell function @xcite .",
    "the hormone insulin is a small protein that is synthesized in the @xmath0-cells and secreted when an increase in the blood glucose level is sensed .",
    "glucose metabolism releases energy needed by cells to do useful work .",
    "insulin is necessary to metabolize glucose and thereby control its level in the blood .",
    "diabetes occurs due to an excessive accumulation of glucose in the blood brought about by an insufficient production of or reduced sensitivity to insulin .",
    "the core of the @xmath0-cell transcriptional network consists of a double positive feedback loop in which the transcription factors @xmath2 and @xmath3 , belonging to the nuclear hepatocyte family , activate each other s synthesis .",
    "there is also some evidence that @xmath3 autorepresses its own synthesis @xcite .",
    "mutations in the transcription factors @xmath2 and @xmath3 give rise to a type of diabetes known as maturity - onset diabetes of the young ( mody ) which has an early onset with age less than usually @xmath4 years .",
    "there are six different forms of mody of which mody 1 and mody 3 are caused by mutations in the genes @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively @xcite .",
    "the structure of the regulatory network , of which the two genes @xmath6 and @xmath5 are integral components , is not fully known .",
    "a partial structure of the complex network is shown in @xcite involving the genes @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath14 the genes collectively control the transcription of a number of important genes involved in glucose metabolism in the @xmath15cell .",
    "these include the glucose transporter @xmath16 ( @xmath17 gene , the glucokinase gene encoding the glycolytic enzyme glucokinase which acts as glucose sensor and also the insulin gene .",
    "odom et al . @xcite",
    "combined chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with promoter microarrays to gain insight on the regulatory circuits formed by @xmath6 and @xmath18 both the proteins are found to control the activity of a large number of target genes in the @xmath15cell .",
    "this recent finding as well as earlier experiments @xcite indicate that the @xmath6 and @xmath5 genes play a prominent role in the pancreatic @xmath15cell function .",
    "mutations in the genes give rise to mody resulting in the impairment of glucose - stimulated insulin secretion .",
    "several experiments @xcite provide clues on the possible molecular origins of mody .",
    "the cross - regulatory interactions between @xmath2 and @xmath3 are switched on as pancreatic @xmath0-cells receive the signals to differentiate .",
    "the double positive feedback loop has the potential for bistability , i.e. , two stable steady states .",
    "the two states are a basal state in which the two genes have low activity and an activated state which corresponds to high protein levels .",
    "the states are analogous to the off and on states of a switch .",
    "normal functioning of the pancreatic @xmath0-cells requires the two - gene feedback loop to be in the on state .",
    "the circuit operation is , however , vulnerable to decreased gene dosage caused by mutations ( in a diploid organism each gene has two identical copies ) .",
    "genetic disorders , termed haploinsufficiency , are known to occur due to reduced gene dosage resulting in decreased protein levels @xcite .",
    "gene expression noise increases the probability that a protein level falls below a threshold value so that the protein amount is insufficient for meaningful activity .",
    "the loss of vital protein functions is responsible for the occurrence of genetic disorders .",
    "mody , brought about by reduced gene dosage , is thus an example of haploinsufficiency @xcite .",
    "we construct a mathematical model to study the dynamics of the core circuit consisting of a double positive feedback loop coupled with autorepression of the @xmath5 gene .",
    "we use both deterministic and stochastic approaches to identify the functional features of the motif and discuss their possible relevance in the occurrence of mody",
    "the circuit diagram of the motif to be studied is shown in the figure 1 .",

    "protein synthesis occurs in the activated state of the gene ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) attained via the binding of protein dimers @xmath23 and @xmath24 to the genes @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively .",

    "the rate constants for protein degradation are @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath37 denoting the degradation product .",
    "dimer degradation is not taken into account as its rate is few - fold lower than the degradation rate of protein monomers .",
    "for the gene @xmath20 , there is an extra biochemical event representing autorepression .",
    "the dimers @xmath23 and @xmath24 bind the promoter region of the gene gs competitively , i.e. , the binding of one type of dimer excludes the binding of the other type . when the dimer @xmath23 binds at @xmath20 , there is complete repression",

    "the positive feedback loop provides a stable mechanism of gene expression since the two genes reset each other s activity to the functional state under physiological perturbations .",
    "this serves to self - perpetuate the activity of the two genes and their targets in the pancreatic @xmath15cells .",
    "normal functioning of these cells requires both the protein levels to be high .",
    "the system of two genes that are constitutively on are less robust under physiological perturbations since there is no resetting mechanism by which both the genes are in the functional on state .",
    "the theoretical suggestions of bistability due to the existence of a positive feedback loop @xcite , backed up by the results of our mathematical model , should be tested in actual experiments .",
    "the on@xmath1off switch is brought about by protein fluctuations the origin of which lies in stochastic gene expression .",
    "our major finding is that negative feedback makes the on@xmath1off transitions less probable and the off@xmath1on transitions more probable .",
    "thus the function of the negative feedback appears to be to protect the normal @xmath0-cell function since the cell is more likely to be in the on state in this case .",
    "the asymmetric response to fluctuations prevents switching off and facilitates switching on of the high expression state . in the deterministic scenario",
    ", one finds that the difference between the on state and the unstable steady state protein level increases as the autorepression strength is increased whereas the difference between the unstable steady state and off state protein levels decreases on increasing the autorepression strength .",
    "this may explain the asymmetry in the on@xmath1off and off@xmath1on switches when stochasticity is taken into account . for moderate strengths of autorepression ,",
    "the system is locked in the on state for extremely long times . in our simulations",
    ", we did not encounter on@xmath1off switches for very long trajectories ( @xmath155 seconds ) with @xmath156 .",
    "this translates into lifetimes measured in years and explains the delayed onset of the diabetic phenotype @xcite .",
    "the phenotype generally appears after several years indicating that the activation of the on@xmath1off switch is rare .",
    "the average age at which mody is manifest could thus be dictated by the probability that a sufficient number of @xmath0-cells is locked in the off state .",
    "we have considered the simplest form of negative autoregulation in our two - gene model .",
    "there are recent suggestion that negative autoregulation of the hnf-4@xmath57 gene in the pancreatic @xmath0-cells may be more complex @xcite .",
    "also , the number of transcription factor binding sites of the two genes is not known with certainty .",
    "cooperative binding at multiple sites is expected to promote the stability of the gene expression states .",
    "our two - gene motif constitutes a minimal model which seeks to explains the desirable features of combining a double positive feedback loop with an autorepressive loop vis -  - vis the normal functional activity of @xmath0-cells . the insight gained from the model study",
    "is expected to provide a basis for the investigation of more complex cases .",
    "the two - gene network model .",
    "the protein products of the @xmath19 and @xmath20 genes activate each other s synthesis .",
    "there is also an autorepressive loop in which the proteins of the @xmath20 gene repress their own synthesis .",
