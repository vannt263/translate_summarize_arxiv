    "string duality , a symmetry of string theory , gives information about the behavior of string theory at strong coupling .",
    "it provides evidence about nonperturbative aspects of the theory .",
    "this symmetry implies that the strongly coupled limit of every string theory is equivalent to the weakly coupled limit of some other theory .",
    "it is now believed that the known superstring theories are different realisations of some more fundamental underlying theory . in order to understand the nature of this unknown theory it seems necessary to gather as much data about it as possible by studying examples of stringy vacua .",
    "most non - perturbative string dualities require the existence of elementary ramond - ramond ( rr ) charges which couple to the rr fields contained in the spectrum of type - i and type - ii superstring theories @xcite . as is well known string perturbation theory contains no such elementary rr charges .",
    "since a @xmath5 form couples naturally to a @xmath6-brane , an extended object with @xmath6 spatial dimensions , duality requires us to consider such branes carrying rr charges .",
    "such @xmath6- branes were originally found and studied as soliton solutions of the effective low - energy supergravity @xcite .",
    "however , following polchinski s work @xcite it has become clear that there is a much simpler description of @xmath6-branes carrying rr charges .",
    "this description amounts to considering @xmath6-branes to which end points of open strings can be attached .",
    "this is accomplished by imposing dirichlet boundary conditions on the world sheet fields , hence the name d@xmath6-branes or d - branes .",
    "since string theory contains gravity , the d - branes are also a source for the gravitational field and therefore they represent a class of `` black '' objects of the family of generalized black holes . actually , the rr charged solitons required by string duality first appeared as black @xmath6-brane solutions to the low energy effective theory .",
    "the conformal field theory description of d - branes proposed in @xcite has allowed considerable progress in accounting for the black hole information paradox and in probing the nature of spacetime at the shortest distance scales .",
    "examples of black holes in four and five dimensions have been constructed for which the degeneracy of microscopic d - brane states matches the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xcite .",
    "this conformal field theory formulation consists of type ii superstrings with mixed dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions .",
    "such a world sheet approach has made it possible to explicitly compute several properties which had been anticipated by arguments of duality and supersymmetry .",
    "one of the most intriguing hints from duality is the appearance of new length scales in string theory @xcite . by studying zero - brane dynamics it was possible to probe distances much shorter than the string scale @xcite .",
    "scattering of massless closed string states off d - branes at leading order in perturbation theory have made manifest the stringy features of the rr solitons @xcite , such as the regge behaviour and the exponential fall off of fixed angle scattering @xcite .",
    "the exchange of massless states on the disk at zero momentum transfer has been shown to agree with the @xmath6-brane solution to the effective field theory at low energies .",
    "a systematic approach to all massless two point functions on a disk was recently developed in @xcite where it was shown that there is a direct relation between four point functions of type i theory and two point functions of type ii theory in a d - brane background .    in this paper",
    "we study the axion production amplitude from an incoming graviton off a system of two d@xmath0-branes , or d - particles , in a superstring type ii theory .",
    "actually , we will see that both choices of neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions in the compactified coordinates give the same result , and thus we speak of 0-branes referring to the uncompactified coordinates .",
    "the amplitude for this process vanishes in the case of one d - brane @xcite .",
    "therefore , the brane - brane interaction plays a crucial role in our interesting non trivial result and the process can be regarded as a mechanism to obtain novel features of the physics of d - branes .",
    "the two @xmath0-branes interact via the exchange of closed string states which form a cylinder joining them . computing",
    "the above amplitude implies the insertion of two ns - ns vertices on the cylinder with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "it is easy to show that this leads to a vanishing result in 10 dimensions because of the abstruse identity .",
    "having in mind a more interesting scenario , we consider a realistic compactification scheme breaking the supersymmetry down to @xmath7 in 4 dimensions .",
    "the presence of the branes will further reduce the supersymmetry to @xmath8 . in order to be able to do an explicit computation we consider compactification on the standard @xmath1 orbifold .",
    "this breaks enough supersymmetry to allow a non - zero result .",
    "we find that the only non - zero contribution to the particular axion - graviton amplitude under consideration , comes from the odd spin structure sector ( recall that the boundary conditions for world sheet fermions can be classified according to the spin - structure ) .",
    "interestingly enough , the odd spin - structure corresponds to one term of the gso projection of the rr world sheet fermions .",
    "we also find that the only contribution to the odd spin structure amplitude from the compactified coordinates arises in the twisted sector of the closed string ( recall that in an orbifold compactification twisted and untwisted sectors , by an element of the symmetry group , have to be considered ) .",
    "the branes can not transfer energy but they can transfer momenta .",
    "poles in the momentum transfer arise when the vertices corresponding to the graviton and the axion come together on the cylinder .",
    "we refer to this process as the pinching limit .",
    "this pole signals the propagation of a massless closed string state , which couples to the the point where the axion and graviton vertices come together .",
    "it could be interpreted as a virtual axion , propagating out of the two branes system , which is eventually made real by absorbing the incoming graviton .",
    "the residue of the pole can also be singular rather than constant .",
    "this further singularity signals the propagation of massless closed string states between the branes , whose proper time is the length of the cylinder .",
    "the region in which the length of the cylinder diverges can be viewed as an infrared limit of long time propagation , the field theory limit .",
    "it corresponds to the exchange of the lowest closed string states , showing the suppression of massive closed string states at large distances .",
    "we study the amplitude in the pinching limit and field theory limit , taking together all the possible sources of singularities in order to find the leading behavior for small momentum transfer , corresponding to large distances .",
    "the structure of the resulting expression in this double limit seems to suggest that the process takes place through the exchange of an axion which couples to the rr states being exchanged between the d - particles .",
    "we can also think of our amplitude containing two @xmath0-branes as the second order perturbative term in the classical ( i.e. tree level ) evaluation of the graviton - axion scattering off a single @xmath0-brane .",
    "namely , in this picture the @xmath0-brane plays the role of a source , and the classical perturbative expansion of a nonlinear field theory with a source gives rise to terms in each of which the source appears repeatedly @xcite",
    ". we will be interested in the evaluation of the amplitude for small momentum transfer , that is at large distances from the source .",
    "thus we could interpret the intermediate states coming out of the branes as the halo of the fields surrounding the gravitational object represented by the @xmath0-brane .",
    "in particular , in this paper we compute a scattering amplitude which is zero on one @xmath0-brane @xcite , that is at the lowest classical perturbative order , and thus we can interpret the result as an effect due to the halo .",
    "our computation gives the exact leading result for large distances .",
    "we have organized the paper such that the arguments can be followed without being distracted by too much side information or computations and therefore we have kept in the main text only what is strictly necessary for its understanding .",
    "additional information and technical details have been put in appendices . in section [ sec - cor ]",
    "we compute the correlators of bosonic and fermionic world sheet fields on the cylinder . in section [ sec - amp ]",
    "we present some general considerations on how to construct the scattering amplitude for two ns - ns fields using the closed string formulation . in this section",
    "we also show how the ghosts are consistently taken care of , so that we can subsequently work in the light cone formalism . in section [ sec - boundary ]",
    "we review the construction for the rr boundary state and show that the compactified untwisted sector of the closed string does not contribute to the amplitude . in section",
    "[ 2 ] we calculate the final form of the scattering amplitude for the graviton - axion off the two @xmath0-branes . in section [ pinch ]",
    "we consider the pinching limit and the behaviour of the amplitude at small @xmath9 and discuss the result .",
    "the content of the appendices is the following : in appendix a and b we describe the vacuum amplitude ( that is the case without vertex insertions ) for the two interacting branes , first reviewing the n=4 supersymmetric case in app.a and then constructing the orbifold case giving n=1 in app.b . in appendix c",
    "we show the vanishing of the even spin structures contribution , and in appendix d we complete the analysis of the field theory limit by computing subleading terms .",
    "in this section we review the construction of the cylinder and the correlators of bosonic and fermionic fields on the cylinder .",
    "d - branes are described by open superstrings with their end points fixed on a @xmath5 dimensional hypersurface embedded in ten dimensional spacetime .",
    "the coordinates @xmath10 , ( @xmath11 ) with conventional neumann boundary conditions , span the world volume swept by the @xmath6-brane , whereas @xmath12 , ( @xmath13 ) label the transverse directions with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "let us consider a cylinder joining two branes at @xmath14 and @xmath15 , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a closed string state appearing from one d - brane , propagating in euclidean time @xmath16 and disappearing in the other @xcite .",
    "@xmath17 is a periodic coordinate running from @xmath0 to @xmath18 .",
    "epsf    we map the cylinder joining the two branes into a world sheet cylinder . following burgess and morris @xcite",
    "we construct this cylinder from the torus . using the complex coordinate @xmath19 ,",
    "the torus in figure 2 is the rectangle @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the cylinder is obtained by reflecting about the dotted line @xmath22 and identifying the segments oa with bc .",
    "this corresponds to the involution @xmath23 and leaves invariant @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "note that we have taken @xmath26 pure imaginary , and @xmath27 is the real teichmuller parameter in terms of the length of the cylinder .    in these coordinates",
    "the neumann boundary conditions for the bosonic fields are _ _ 1 x^a(_1=0,_2 ) = _ _ 1 x^a(_1=l,_2 ) = 0 , whereas the dirichlet boundary conditions , @xmath28 are implemented by writing x^i(w)=+x^i_quantum(w ) , with x^i_quantum(_1=0)=x^i_quantum(_1=l)=0 , and @xmath29 is the separation of the d - branes in the @xmath30 direction .",
    "epsf    with these boundary conditions , we can then construct the bosonic and fermionic propagators on the cylinder using the usual torus propagators . for fermions , the operator representing the involution @xmath31 is @xmath32 @xcite in the two dimensional spinor space .",
    "it follows from world sheet supersymmetry that the neumann boundary conditions are @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , giving @xmath35 , whereas for dirichlet boundary conditions we get @xmath36 . here and subsequently",
    "@xmath37 mean right ( left ) moving fields respectively . we can drop the shift @xmath38 from the argument , which just brings us back to the upper half plane into the torus . in other words instead of working in the upper half plane we can equally well work in the strip @xmath39 .",
    "also in this paper we are only concerned with d@xmath0-branes in the uncompactified directions .",
    "the vertices that we need to insert on the cylinder contain only uncompactified string coordinates .",
    "thus we can restrict here the discussion to the case in which the coordinate index is @xmath40 .",
    "the coordinates and the fermions in the time direction have neumann boundary conditions , whereas the ones in the three space directions have dirichlet conditions .",
    "thus the boundary conditions on the fermions can be written in a compact form as |^(|z)=s^_^(x),[bcf ] with @xmath41 and @xmath42 and off diagonal @xmath43 .",
    "thus we only need to specify the @xmath44 correlator , @xmath45 being complex coordinates .",
    "the above notation can be used for the correlators of the bosonic coordinates , which can be written as < x^(z,|z)x^(w,|w)>=-^g(z , w ) -s^g(z,|w ) where g(x_1,x_2 ) = ln |_1(x_1-x_2|)|^2 - 2[g ] and @xmath46 .    for the fermionic correlators one has to specify the spin structure @xmath47 .",
    "for the three even spin structures we have _ s = -^ _ s(x_1-x_2|)_1(x_1-x_2| ) _1(0)_s(0 ) = -^ f_s(x_1-x_2),[eferprop ] where @xmath48 are defined in appendix a. as for the @xmath49 correlators , they are determined by the requirement that they have one pole at @xmath50 , like @xmath51 . in fact , since in the odd spin structure case @xmath52 has the same periodicity conditions as @xmath53 , these requirements give",
    "_ odd = -^ _ x_1g(x_1,x_2 ) = -^ f(x_1-x_2).[ferprop ] remember that , due to eq.([bcf ] ) , eqs.([eferprop ] ) and ( [ ferprop ] ) also encode the @xmath54 and @xmath55 propagators .",
    "actually the odd case requires a more complete discussion .",
    "we come back to that at the end of the next section .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we consider the scattering of ns - ns fields from a system of two @xmath0-branes in a superstring theory compactified down to four dimensions on the standard @xmath1 orbifold .",
    "the cylinder depicted in figure 1 is a one loop open string graph .",
    "the world line of the open string boundary can be regarded as a state connecting the vacuum to one closed string .",
    "thus one has to first construct boundary states as we do our calculation in the closed string formulation .",
    "our @xmath0-branes are such that only the time coordinate @xmath56 has neumann boundary conditions .",
    "the three uncompactified space coordinates have dirichlet boundary conditions . using the conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite , the neumann and dirichlet boundary conditions translate into the following conditions for the boundary state ( @xmath57 means modes of the @xmath58 fourier expansion ) : ( _ n^0 + _",
    "-n^0 ) |b > = 0,(_n^0 + i^0_-n ) |b > = 0[bon ] and ( _ n^i - _ -n^i ) |b > = 0,(_n^i - i^i_-n ) |b > = 0[dbc ] for all @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath59 denote the three uncompactified space directions and the tilded or untilded operators correspond to the mode expansion of right and left movers .",
    "further , @xmath60 and we will see that the different spin structures arise from taking the same or opposite value of @xmath61 for the boundary states of the two branes respectively .    here",
    "we have lumped together ns - ns and r - r sectors .",
    "these are specified by taking @xmath57 to be half - integer or integer , repectively in the mode expansion for the fermions . to be general we also have to specify the boundary state conditions for the six compact coordinates , @xmath62 .",
    "one has to keep several things in mind here .",
    "the boundary state condition will include not only the spin structure factor @xmath61 and neumann ( dirichlet ) signs but one has also to project onto the @xmath63 invariant states @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss this further later in this section .",
    "also we have to remember that in the @xmath58 twisted sectors the moding is not integral or half integral but in integer multiples of @xmath64 .",
    "these conditions implicitly define the boundary state @xmath65 , with momentum @xmath66 .",
    "then the boundary states on the two @xmath0-branes are given by        now we review the general construction of the scattering amplitude , leaving the details to be explained in other sections .",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath67 can be written as a path integral over world - sheet fields on a cylinder .",
    "the integrand is the product of two ns - ns vertices , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , in the 0-ghost picture , constructed from world sheet fields with components only in the uncompactified directions ( remember that on the cylinder the worldsheet left and right moving fields are identified up to some phase ) .",
    "the result of the integration can be cast in the form a(l;z , w)=_s ( ) < u(z,|z)v(w,|w)>_sz_s , [ scatamp ] where @xmath70 is evaluated in terms of correlators by using the wick theorem , and @xmath71 is the socalled partition function given by z_s = < b|e^-lh_s|b>_s,[partf ] where @xmath72 is the relevant hamiltonian for the world sheet fields .",
    "for the fermionic coordinates one has to specify the spin structure @xmath47 and sum over the spin structures with appropriate signs as indicated above .",
    "the four spin structures correspond in the operatorial language to the two terms of the gso projection for each of the ns - ns and rr fermions .",
    "eventually one has to integrate over the @xmath73 vertex positions on the cylinder and over the cylinder length @xmath74 , giving the final scattering amplitude as = _ 0^dl l^-e^-y^2d^2zd^2wa(l;z , w).[amp ] we are interested in the case when the vertices only contain uncompactified coordinates . in principle",
    "@xmath75 also contains a sum over the discrete compactified momenta @xmath76 ( they are zero if there are neumann boundary conditions in the corresponding directions , or for dirichlet compactified directions one has a wave function like for the uncompactified case ) . since later we will be interested in the @xmath77 corner of the moduli space ( because it will correspond to the field theory limit ) and since each momentum @xmath76 is weighted by a factor @xmath78 from the compact hamiltonian , only the @xmath79 term of the sum will be relevant . in conclusion",
    ", we can take the momenta in the compact direction to be zero for both the neumann and dirichlet compactified directions .",
    "correspondingly we refer to our branes as @xmath0-branes , even when they could be neumann in the internal compact directions .",
    "the partition function is the result of the functional integration without vertex insertions ( i.e. there is 1 in the place of the vertices ) .",
    "it is a product of the integration over the bosonic coordinates , the @xmath80 ghosts , the fermionic coordinates and the @xmath81 ghosts .",
    "the @xmath80 ghost contribution cancels the contribution of the bosonic pair @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath81 ghost contribution is like the inverse of the fermionic pair @xmath83 for every spin structure , and thus it cancels this latter contribution .",
    "thus , the partition function has the form of the  light - cone \" expression z_s = z^b_lcz^f_lc , s,[partfunct ] where @xmath84 is the product of the contributions of the @xmath85 pairs , and @xmath86 is the product of the contributions of the @xmath87 pairs .    with our conventions @xmath88 , with @xmath89 , and @xmath90 with upper / lower sign for @xmath91 or @xmath92 .",
    "thus @xmath93 and , for @xmath94 , @xmath95 are like fermionic destruction or creation operators .",
    "the contribution of each pair is derived in appendix b.    in order to compute @xmath70 we need the explicit form of the correlators which are given in section  [ sec - cor ] .",
    "correlators can involve a pair of @xmath53 s , a pair of @xmath52 s , a pair of @xmath96 s , or one @xmath52 and one @xmath96 .",
    "we show in appendix c that for the particular case of the graviton - axion amplitude , which we consider in this paper , only the odd spin structure contributes .",
    "we recall that the odd spin structure corresponds to a part of the gso projection of the rr fermions .",
    "we also anticipate that the @xmath58 untwisted case for the compactified coordinates does not contribute for the relevant odd spin structure .    in the odd spin structure case",
    "the fermionic coordinates have zero modes and therefore the result will be zero unless the amplitude contains a sufficient number of fermionic fields . in the relevant - twisted - orbifold case",
    "the zero modes only appear for the noncompactified coordinates @xmath97 .",
    "thus , only the terms in the expression of @xmath98 containing a factor @xmath99 will contribute to the path integral ( remember that some @xmath100 s can appear in the place of @xmath52 , with the identification of eq.([bcf ] ) ) .",
    "we can still express the result in the form of eq.([scatamp ] ) , with the understanding that the partition function contains the zero modes insertion .",
    "for this odd spin structure sector we obtain @xmath101 , as in this case the part of the gso projection of the rr fermions exactly compensates the bosonic contribution ( see appendix b ) .    therefore in eq.([scatamp ] ) we need to compute the remaining part of @xmath102 .",
    "altogether this amounts to saying that we compute @xmath102 by wick s theorem , using the correlators specified above , and factorizing in each term a factor _",
    "odd = -i^ to keep into account the hermiticity properties and the sign of the different permutations .",
    "we recall again that _ odd= -^ _",
    "x_1 g(x_1,x_2 ) and note that the nonholomorphic part of the rhs actually cancels when summing the various terms of @xmath102 .",
    "here we review the construction of the boundary state for the rr case and show that the @xmath17 untwisted odd spin structure does not contribute to our amplitude .",
    "consider first the four uncompactified fermionic coordinates @xmath103 , with @xmath97 .",
    "when performing the fourier analysis in @xmath17 we get modes @xmath104 in the rr case : they can be identified with the @xmath105-matrices @xmath106 and @xmath107 , with @xmath108 , which act on a subspace which is a direct product of two spinor spaces @xmath109 .",
    "let us examine the sector of the boundary state related to this subspace .",
    "since we have neumann boundary condition in time and dirichlet in space , we have for the boundary state @xmath110 ( ^0 + i^0 ) |b > & = & 0 + ( ^= 0 -i^= 0 ) |b > & = & 0 where @xmath111 has been put for later convenience .",
    "let us define @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , @xmath115 such that @xmath116 , similarly for @xmath117 , and zero for the other anticommutators .",

    "remember that one has also to project over the @xmath1 invariant states , and this is implemented by the average over @xmath139 .",

    "one can now construct the action of @xmath142 on the boundary state in the following way .",
    "namely , consider the ( 4,5 ) ( 6,7 ) ( 8,9 ) pairs , and construct for each of them the @xmath143 operators like we have done for the ( 2,3 ) pair . the action of an element @xmath142 of @xmath1 amounts to @xmath144 , with @xmath145 such that @xmath146 mod @xmath147@xcite ( see appendix b ) .",

    "but we have further to consider that in the low energy state of the brane the wave function will be spread over the compactified directions .",
    "thus we have to do an average over the compactified position of the brane , as it would be done for the nuclei wave function in a molecule within the born oppenheimer approximation . like",
    "above , the integration over the position includes also a sum over the fixed points . in conclusion , the fixed points always contribute , bringing in the @xmath17-twisted sector .    in this appendix",
    "we discuss the contribution from the even spin structures to the graviton - axion scattering amplitude .",
    "the only possible non vanishing invariant in this case is @xmath294 .",
    "this can arise either from purely bosonic contractions or from terms containing four or eight fermions .",
    "actually the contribution from the eight fermionic contractions is found to vanish .",
    "the result is ( phb k)e^-<kx(z ) px(w ) > \\{_z_wp_d |_zp_d |_wp_d - |_z|_wp_d _ zp_d _ wp_d - _",
    "z|_wp_d |_zp_d _",
    "wp_d + + |_z_wp_d _ zp_d |_wp_d + _ z_wp_d f(|z - |w)^2_s - |_z|_wp_d f ( z - w)^2_s + - _ z|_wp_d f(|z - w)^2_s + |_z_wp_d f ( z - |w)^2_s +",
    "_ zp_d _ wp_d ( kp ) f(|z - |w)^2_s + -|_zp_d |_wp_d ( kp ) f ( z - w)^2_s - _ zp_d |_wp_d ( kp ) f(|z - w)^2_s +    any of the three even spin structure fermionic propagators . as we see , the terms come out in pairs , always in the form : a term minus its complex conjugate .",
    "now , it is easy to see that the integration over @xmath295 produces a real result , and thus the entire contribution from the even spin structure vanishes .",
    "indeed , first observe that @xmath296 is real , then also that each term in the above expression , call it @xmath297 , is even by doing simultaneously @xmath298 .",
    "thus ^1/2_-1/2drez^1/2_-1/2drew t(z ,",
    "w)= ^1/2_-1/2drez^1/2_-1/2drew t(|z,|w ) i.e. the result is real .      in this appendix",
    "we analyze the small @xmath9 limit of the amplitude , arguing that the leading behaviour comes from the pinching limit @xmath299 of the term proportional to @xmath300 in eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) .",
    "this leading result , which provides the strongest singularity for @xmath177 and thus the leading behaviour at large distances , has been analyzed in section [ pinch ] .",
    "here we look for the @xmath301 limit of every term of eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) , including @xmath300 without taking the pinching limit .",
    "the leading behaviour comes from the region of the moduli space @xmath302 and @xmath303 .",
    "let us define @xmath306 and @xmath307 and use the following asymptotic behaviour for @xmath173 f(z - w ) + i ( - ) thus , the limit @xmath308 at fixed @xmath309 of the different terms appearing in the amplitude is f(z - w ) i[-(- ) + - ] + 1f(|z-|w ) -i [ -(- ) + - ] + 1f(z-|w ) i[- 1 + + ] + 1f(|z - w ) i[- 1 + + ] + 1f(w-|w ) i[- 1 + 2 ] ( where @xmath310 ) and moreover e^-<kx(z ) px(w ) > e^-2q^2l(1-)+2k_0 ^ 2l(-)^2  for  >",

    "we have then for the terms proportional to @xmath316 in eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) the integral ( keeping the large @xmath74 contribution ) dll^-3/2l^2 _ 0 ^ 1 d(1- ) e^-2q^2l(1- ) both for @xmath317 and for @xmath318 . from this",
    "last integral we get a behaviour @xmath319 , which gives for the amplitude @xmath320 , i.e. subleading with respect to the behaviour coming from the pinching limit .",
    "let us consider next the terms in eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) proportional to @xmath321 .",
    "it is seen from the above equations on the @xmath302 behaviour that altogether they give an integrand of the form f(,)e^-<kx(z ) px(w ) > where @xmath322 . from that one",
    "can expect , as it is confirmed by a more detailed analysis , that the subsequent integrations will give a result for the amplitude not worse than @xmath323 for @xmath177 .",
    "finally let us consider the terms of the kind @xmath305 , where @xmath324 can be @xmath325 or @xmath326 etc .",
    "consider for instance the term @xmath327 ( the discussion for the others being similar ) .",
    "its behaviour for @xmath302 is ~1",
    "sin^2(z - w)+1 l we then take @xmath328 , @xmath329 and the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath330 gives a vanishing contribution due to the integration over @xmath331 .",
    "there remains the term @xmath332 , which , after the gaussian integration described above and the subsequent integrations , gives for the amplitude again a result like @xmath323 for @xmath177 .",
