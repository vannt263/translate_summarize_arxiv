    "the key point in the proof of theorem  [ 1.2 ] is a simple @xmath22 matrix calculation that i essentially did in @xcite .",
    "note that theorem  [ 1.2 ] implies stylianakis result for @xmath21 .",
    "theorem  [ 1.2 ] does not hold when @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as @xmath25 is a finite group ( the alternating group @xmath26 ) .",
    "i believe that the remaining case ( @xmath23 , @xmath27 ) of stylianakis theorem can also be proved using the skein - theoretic method exposed below , but it would require a calculation with @xmath28 matrices which i have not done ( see remark  [ remaining ] ) .",
    "the proof will be based on the representation of the braid group @xmath7 on the kauffman bracket @xcite skein module of the @xmath29-ball relative to @xmath2 marked points on the boundary .",

    "our representation @xmath35 can also be viewed as a tqft representation of @xmath3 .",

    "we shall only need birman s presentation ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.5 ) of @xmath3 as a quotient of @xmath7 and elementary skein theory .",
    "we start with the representation of the braid group @xmath7 on the kauffman bracket skein module of the @xmath29-ball relative to @xmath2 marked points on the boundary .",
    "let us recall how this representation , which we denote by @xmath35 , is defined .",
    "the skein module is a free @xmath37$]-module of dimension @xmath38 ( the catalan number ) .",
    "its elements are represented by @xmath37$]-linear combinations of @xmath39-tangle diagrams , that is , tangle diagrams in a rectangle relative to @xmath2 marked points at the top of the rectangle .",
    "the diagrams are considered modulo the kauffman skein relations ( which will be stated shortly ) .",
    "the skein module has a standard basis given by tangle diagrams without crossings and without closed circles .",

    "the @xmath17-th braid generator @xmath8 acts on a diagram @xmath43 by gluing the usual braid diagram of @xmath44 on top of @xmath43 ( that is , the braid diagram which has a crossing @xmath45{l+2.eps}$ ] at the @xmath17-th and @xmath46-st strand and all other strands are vertical ) .",

    "the second kauffman skein relation , which fixes the value of an unknot diagram to @xmath50 , implies that @xmath51 a simple recursion now establishes that @xmath52 where @xmath53 ) .",
    "thus we have the following          this is well - known but here is a proof .",
    "the group @xmath3 is the quotient of @xmath7 by the relations @xmath61 where @xmath62 @xmath63 ( see ( * ? ? ? * thm  4.5 ) ) . using the isotopy invariance of the kauffman bracket , it is easy to check that @xmath64 @xmath65 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this proves the proposition .",
    "_ for appropriate roots of unity @xmath30 , the induced projective - linear representation of @xmath3 is a tqft representation , as follows from the skein - theoretic construction of witten - reshetikhin - turaev tqft in @xcite . _    by abuse of notation , we denote the induced homomorphism @xmath66 , which sends @xmath18 to @xmath67 , again by @xmath35 .",
    "thus we have realized condition ( i ) of the strategy outlined in  2 . to realize condition ( ii ) , it suffices to find an element @xmath68 so that @xmath69 has infinite order in @xmath70 we now show that @xmath71 works .",
    "recall the diagrams @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) depicted above . by taking disjoint union of @xmath72 with some fixed @xmath74-tangle diagram @xmath75 ( so",
    "that the first @xmath76 points are the boundary of @xmath72 , and the remaining @xmath77 points are the boundary of @xmath75 ) , we get two diagrams @xmath78 and @xmath79 which form part of a basis of our skein module .",
    "the two - dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath78 and @xmath79 is preserved by both @xmath80 and @xmath81 . on this subspace",
    ", @xmath80 and @xmath81 act by the following matrices : @xmath82 \\hskip 1 cm   \\rho(\\sigma_2 ) = \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } a^{-1 } & 0 \\\\ a & -a^3 \\end{array } \\right]\\ ] ] ( this follows immediately from the kauffman relations . ) a straightforward calculation now gives that the matrix of @xmath83 acting on this @xmath4-dimensional subspace is @xmath84\\ ] ]        for @xmath91 and @xmath92 , this is shown in @xcite , as one can check that the matrix @xmath85 is conjugate to the one computed in @xcite .",
    "we can also apply the argument of @xcite directly to our matrix , as follows .",
    "note that @xmath85 has determinant @xmath93 and trace @xmath94 where @xmath88 . if @xmath85 has finite order in @xmath86 , then its eigenvalues @xmath95 and @xmath96 must satisfy @xmath97 for some @xmath98 , so @xmath95 is a root of unity .",
    "but this is impossible , as we can find a primitive @xmath87-th root @xmath99 such that @xmath100 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus @xmath85 has infinite order in @xmath86 .",
    "then @xmath55 , so prop .",
    "[ 3.1 ] applies .",
    "also @xmath88 has order @xmath89 , @xmath90 , so lemma  [ 3.3 ] applies . thus @xmath35 satisfies condition ( i ) because of prop .  [ 3.1 ] , and @xmath35 satisfies condition ( ii ) because the matrix @xmath83 has infinite order in @xmath57 .",
    "this completes the proof .    _ the proof of prop .  [ 3.2 ] shows that one can rescale @xmath35 to get a representation @xmath114 of @xmath7 which descends to @xmath3 as a _ linear _ representation : put @xmath115 where @xmath116 ; then @xmath117 note that @xmath118 one may wonder whether @xmath119 can be chosen so that @xmath120 .",
