    "measuring the spatial distribution of a population of newly - formed stars can offer insight into the star formation process .",
    "because of its youth and low stellar density , the stellar content within the taurus - auriga molecular cloud probably has undergone the least dynamical evolution of any nearby star - forming region , and therefore is the best available site for measuring a primordial spatial distribution of young stars .",
    "several studies over the last decade have taken advantage of this fact to address various aspects of star formation .",
    "for instance , measurements of the distribution of stars in taurus have revealed effects of both binary formation and the jeans condition on clustering properties @xcite while a comparison of the distributions of stars and molecular material in taurus has constrained the velocity dispersion with which the stars are born and the nature of cloud fragmentation @xcite .",
    "measuring the spatial distribution of taurus members as a function of mass is another potentially rewarding experiment .",
    "several studies have suggested that brown dwarfs might form as protostellar sources whose accretion is prematurely halted by ejection from multiple systems @xcite . some of these ejection models have predicted that newborn brown dwarfs could have higher velocity dispersions than their stellar counterparts @xcite .",
    "if so , brown dwarfs would be more widely distributed than stars in star - forming regions .",
    "for instance , @xcite favored an ejection model with a one - dimensional velocity dispersion of @xmath2  km  s@xmath3 , which corresponds to an angular distance of @xmath4 for an object traveling for 1  myr at the distance of taurus .",
    "meanwhile , other models of ejection predict that stars and brown dwarfs should have similar spatial and velocity distributions @xcite .    over time",
    ", surveys for substellar members of taurus have encompassed larger areas surrounding the stellar aggregates .",
    "some of these data have exhibited no statistically significant differences in the spatial distributions of the high- and low - mass members of taurus @xcite while other data have suggested a possible difference @xcite . to search for an extended population of brown dwarfs beyond the previous survey fields and to measure the distribution of brown dwarfs in taurus on the largest size scales ,",
    "i have performed a survey for brown dwarfs across an area of 225  deg@xmath0 containing the entire taurus star - forming region . in this paper ,",
    "i describe the selection of candidate substellar members of taurus (   [ sec : cand ] ) and the spectroscopy and classification of these candidates (   [ sec : spec ] ) , evaluate the completeness of this survey and the recent one by @xcite (   [ sec : complete ] ) , and use the resulting updated census of taurus to perform a definitive comparison of the distributions of stars and brown dwarfs in this region (   [ sec : spatial ] ) .",
    "previous surveys for low - mass stars and brown dwarfs in the taurus star - forming region have identified candidates through color - magnitude and color - color diagrams constructed from optical and near - infrared ( ir ) photometry ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter g06 ) .",
    "those optical data were obtained through dedicated imaging with wide - field cameras of areas ranging from @xmath5 to 28  deg@xmath6 .",
    "ir measurements for these optical fields were then taken from the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "2mass is also the source of ir photometry for the survey in this work .",
    "however , as a substitute for optical ccd photometry , i use the photometric measurements designated as the second epoch near - ir magnitude ( or photographic @xmath7 ) in the usno - b1.0 catalog @xcite , which is referred to as @xmath8 in this work . by employing only all - sky catalogs , one can survey a field of any area and position .",
    "therefore , i consider a field that is large enough to encompass all of the taurus star - forming region , which i choose to center at @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( j2000 ) with dimensions of @xmath11",
    ". the boundaries of this survey area correspond approximately to the boundaries of the maps in figs .",
    "[ fig : map1 ] and [ fig : map2 ] .    to develop criteria for identifying candidate substellar members of taurus with data from the usno and 2mass catalogs",
    ", i used the 14 known members with spectral types later than m6m6.25 according to the models of @xcite and @xcite and the temperature scale of @xcite . ] from @xcite and prior studies that are resolved by 2mass ( excludes gg  tau  bb ) .",
    "nine of these late - type members have measurements in @xmath8 , while the remaining five sources are below the detection limit .",
    "all of the known late - type members of taurus have measurements in the 2mass catalog .",
    "the sources detected at @xmath8 are shown in a diagram of @xmath12 versus @xmath13 in figure  [ fig : ik ] .",
    "the ranges of colors and magnitudes that encompass these objects can be defined as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "i have performed a similar exercise with @xmath17 versus @xmath18 in figure  [ fig : jhhk ] , where the 14 members later than m6 exhibit colors of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "in addition , the objects with @xmath22 have @xmath23 , and 12 of the 14 late - type members have photometric uncertainties less than 0.05  mag in all three bands of the 2mass data .    to search for new late - type members of taurus that are in the same range of masses and extinctions as the previously known ones , i applied all of the above criteria to the 2mass point source catalog and the usno - b1.0 catalog for the 225  deg@xmath0 field encompassing taurus . for objects not detected in @xmath8 , only the criteria using the 2mass photometry were applied .",
    "this process produced 112 candidates .",
    "i rejected 21 candidates that appeared to be field stars based on color - magnitude diagrams from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , six candidates identified and presented in the concurrent survey by @xcite , and two candidates for which @xmath8 was unavailable because of close proximity to a brighter star rather than a faint flux in that band .",
    "the remaining 83 candidates comprised the final sample .",
    "@xcite presented spectroscopy of 15 candidates , 7 of which were confirmed as members of taurus .",
    "spectroscopy for the other 68 candidates is described in the next section . in ",
    "[ sec : spec ] , i classify 22 candidates as taurus members and 46 candidates as field stars .",
    "i also examined the photometry from the surveys by @xcite and @xcite for candidate low - mass members of taurus that have not been observed spectroscopically . in figure",
    "[ fig:4sh1 ] , the data from @xcite are shown in extinction - corrected diagrams of @xmath24 versus @xmath12 and @xmath25 versus @xmath12 , which were constructed in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "i include with the data the boundary for separating potential members of taurus from probable field stars that was developed by @xcite .",
    "several objects appear above the boundaries of both diagrams , and thus are candidate members .",
    "few undiscovered members are expected to reside among the brighter candidates ( @xmath26 ) since the survey of @xcite already searched those magnitude levels for the fields in question .",
    "however , seven faint sources ( @xmath27 ) are above the boundaries of both diagrams , and thus are candidate substellar members .",
    "i obtained spectra of these seven candidates , as well as two similar candidates from the data of @xcite .",
    "these nine candidates are classified as field stars in   [ sec : spec ] .",
    "in addition to the candidate members of taurus identified in this section , i selected for spectroscopy three known members that lack accurate spectral classifications ( iras  04370 + 2559 , iras  04166 + 2706 , cida  7 ) , three members that were classified as low - mass class  i objects by @xcite ( iras  04158 + 2805 , iras  04248 + 2612 , iras",
    "04489 + 3042 ) , and nine new members from g06 ( cfht  5 , 7 , 11 , 15 - 18 , 20 , 21 ) .",
    "i performed spectroscopy on the 77 candidate taurus members and the 15 known members that were selected in the previous section .",
    "optical and near - ir spectra were obtained for 65 and 18 of the candidates and 14 and 4 of the known members , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : log ] summarizes the observing runs and instrument configurations for these data . in tables",
    "[ tab : field ] and [ tab : mem ] , i indicate the night on which each object was observed .",
    "the procedures for the collection and reduction of the optical spectra with the mmt and hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) were similar to those described by @xcite .",
    "the ir spectra obtained with spex @xcite at the infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) were reduced with the spextool package @xcite and corrected for telluric absorption with the method from @xcite .      to measure spectral types and assess membership in taurus for the objects in my spectroscopic sample , i applied the optical and ir classification methods from my previous studies of taurus and other star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "the spectral types are based predominantly on the absorption bands of vo and tio ( @xmath28  ) and h@xmath29o ( @xmath30  ) . when classifying objects that appear to be young , averages of spectra of dwarfs and giants are used as the spectroscopic standards at optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "for the ir spectra , optically - classified young objects are used as the standards , which ensures that the ir and optical types are on the same classification system .",
    "if dwarfs were instead used as the standards for classifying the ir spectra of taurus members , the resulting spectral types would be systematically later than those derived from the optical spectra because the h@xmath29o absorption bands are stronger in pre - main - sequence sources than in field dwarfs at a given optical spectral type @xcite . to determine whether an object is a member of taurus or a field star , i employ the diagnostics described in my previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such as emission lines , ir excess emission , gravity - sensitive spectral features , and reddening .",
    "only a few of the spectra have sufficiently high resolution and signal - to - noise for a reliable measurement of li absorption , which is another indicator of youth .",
    "based on the optical and ir spectra , i classify 55 candidates as field stars and 22 candidates as members of taurus .",
    "five of the 22 new members ( cfht  9 , 10 , 12 - 14 ) were independently discovered in the recent survey by g06 .",
    "the identifications and photometry from 2mass and the available spectral types for these field stars and new members are provided in tables  [ tab : field ] and [ tab : mem ] , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : mem ] also includes the 15 previously known members that were observed spectroscopically , as well as the evidence of membership for each object .",
    "the spectra of the known and new members are presented in order of spectral type in figs .  [ fig : op1]-[fig : ir1 ] . to facilitate the comparison of these spectra ,",
    "they have been corrected for reddening @xcite .",
    "the positions of the new members are indicated in a map of taurus in figure  [ fig : map1 ] .",
    "interestingly , one of the new brown dwarfs , 2mass  04221332 + 1934392 , is only @xmath31 from t  tau , which has only one other known young star within @xmath32 .",
    "the studies cited above have provided many illustrations of the variations of the gravity - sensitive spectral features between dwarfs , giants , and pre - main - sequence objects that appear in the kind of optical and ir spectra obtained in this work .",
    "i present an additional illustration for the ir spectra by including in figure  [ fig : ir1 ] the spectra of the candidates classified as late - type field dwarfs . in the field dwarfs ,",
    "the @xmath12-band continua exhibit broad plateaus , whereas the taurus members are characterized by sharply peaked , triangular continua . this behavior has been observed in young late - type objects in other star - forming regions @xcite and has been attributed to the dependence of h@xmath29 collision induced absorption on surface gravity @xcite .",
    "a similar effect is found in the @xmath33-band , although it is more subtle than at @xmath12 .",
    "another feature that varies noticeably in these ir spectra is the feh absorption at 0.99  @xcite , which is strong in the dwarfs and very weak or undetected in the young objects .      in terms of the gravity - sensitive features ,",
    "most of the candidates are well - matched to either known taurus members or standard field dwarfs .",
    "the exceptions are 2mass  04172478 + 1634364 , 04324813 + 2431063 , and 04203904 + 2355502 .",
    "the ir spectrum of one of these objects , 2mass  04172478 + 1634364 , is compared to data for a taurus member and a field dwarf in figure  [ fig : ir2 ] .",
    "both the feh absorption and the shape of the @xmath12-band continuum are intermediate between those of the comparison objects , which indicates an intermediate surface gravity .",
    "the other two objects exhibit the same behavior , except that the feh absorption of 2mass  04203904 + 2355502 is dwarf - like .",
    "the gravity - sensitive lines at optical wavelengths are consistent with surface gravities lower than those exhibited by field dwarfs for these three sources .",
    "for instance , in addition to the spectra of known members , figure  [ fig : op3 ] includes the optical spectra of 2mass  04172478 + 1634364 and 04324813 + 2431063 , whose na  i and k  i strengths are indistinguishable from those of the taurus members .",
    "similarly , the third object , 2mass  04203904 + 2355502 , exhibits much weaker na  i than a standard field l dwarf @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : op4 ] .",
    "these optical and ir data are consistent with ages older than taurus ( @xmath34  myr ) and younger than typical field dwarfs ( @xmath35  gyr ) .",
    "these three sources may represent low - mass members of the population of young field stars ( @xmath36  myr ) that @xcite used to explain the wide - field distribution of x - ray sources in the direction of taurus . in this case",
    ", 2mass  04203904 + 2355502 could be a young field l dwarf like the one recently discovered by @xcite .",
    "because of the uncertainty in their ages , it is unclear whether to use dwarfs , taurus members , or stars at some other age as standards when measuring their spectral types . for 2mass  04172478 + 1634364 and 04324813 + 2431063 , the use of dwarfs as standards produces late - m spectral types from the optical spectra and early l types from the ir data",
    "meanwhile , similar spectral types are derived from the two wavelength ranges when taurus members are used as the standards .",
    "therefore , i adopt the latter types for the purposes of this work . for 2mass  04203904 + 2355502 , both the optical and ir spectra are consistent with the same type of l1 when compared to dwarf standards , which is adopted here .",
    "in addition to candidate members of taurus , several previously known members were included in my spectroscopic sample .",
    "i briefly comment on the spectra of three of these known members , iras  04158 + 2805 , iras  04248 + 2612 , and iras  04489 + 3042 , which were classified as possible class  i brown dwarfs by @xcite .",
    "the optical spectra of these objects have strong emission in h@xmath37 , ca  ii , and other permitted and forbidden lines .",
    "for all three sources , both the optical ( 0.6 - 0.9  ) and near - ir ( 0.75 - 2.5  ) spectra exhibit increasing excess emission with decreasing wavelength at @xmath38  when compared to the classification standards",
    ". long wavelength excess emission at @xmath392  is also apparent in the data for iras  04158 + 2805 . in figure",
    "[ fig : ir3 ] , the blue and red excesses for this star are revealed by a comparison to another taurus member at the same spectral type , v410  anon  13 . to avoid veiling by excess emission ,",
    "the spectral types for these stars are primarily based on features at @xmath40  and @xmath41 - 2  in the optical and near - ir spectra , respectively . for each of the three objects ,",
    "the optical and near - ir spectra produce similar spectral types . however , the optical spectra imply much lower extinctions ( @xmath42 - 15 ) than the ir spectra , which is probably caused by the blue excess emission .",
    "the spectral types measured here for iras  04158 + 2805 , iras  04248 + 2612 , and iras  04489 + 3042 are earlier than the ones reported by @xcite , but the two sets of classifications are consistent within the uncertainties .",
    "the combination of my spectral types , the temperature scale of @xcite , and the evolutionary models of @xcite and @xcite suggest that these three class  i sources are low - mass stars rather than brown dwarfs .",
    "all of the fields in taurus that have been previously searched for new low - mass members are encompassed by the 225  deg@xmath0 area considered in this work .",
    "thus , the completeness of the various surveys can be investigated in a straightforward manner by comparing the lists of late - type objects discovered in each survey . in this section ,",
    "i focus on the completeness of my survey and the recent 28  deg@xmath0 survey by g06 .",
    "i first examine the completeness of my usno/2mass survey for the population that was targeted , namely taurus members with spectral types of @xmath39m6 . in this discussion ,",
    "i include the initial sample of members found in this survey that was reported in @xcite . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : cand ] , two of the 14 previously known late - type members of taurus from @xcite and prior studies , kpno  9 ( 8.5 ) and kpno  12 ( m9 ) , have 2mass photometric uncertainties that are greater than the thresholds i adopted for selecting candidates .",
    "three of the six new members at @xmath39m6 that were found in the ccd survey by @xcite did not satisfy the criteria for the usno/2mass survey because itg2 ( m7.25 ) is slightly too bright at @xmath12 , 2mass  04552333 + 3027366 ( m6.25 ) is too blue in @xmath13 , and 2mass  04574903 + 3015195 ( m9.25 ) has photometric uncertainties that are too large . among the 6 new members from g06 that i classify as @xmath39m6",
    ", three objects were not found in my survey because two of them are slightly too faint ( cfht  15 , 16 ) and one is too red in @xmath17 ( cfht  5 ) , and thus is outside of the extinction range considered here .",
    "these results suggest that my survey has a completeness of @xmath43% for taurus members at @xmath39m6 , @xmath44m9 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the completeness would have been @xmath46% if i had selected a slightly brighter limit at @xmath12 and slightly larger thresholds for the 2mass photometric uncertainties ( e.g. , 0.06  mag instead of 0.05  mag ) .    before discussing the completeness of the wide - field survey by @xcite and g06 ,",
    "i summarize its results and place it in the context of other surveys of taurus .",
    "@xcite obtained spectra of candidate low - mass members appearing in an initial set of images covering 3.6  deg@xmath0 , resulting in the discovery of four new members ( cfht  1 - 4 ) .",
    "g06 then presented the results of their full survey of several fields encompassing a total area of 28  deg@xmath0 . after applying their selection criteria for identifying candidate low - mass members , they recovered 17 previously known members of taurus . g06 performed spectroscopy on eight of these known members and treated two of them as new discoveries ( cfht  6 and 8) , which had been found earlier by @xcite . through spectroscopy of a large sample of candidates",
    ", g06 discovered an additional 15 new members .",
    "five of those new objects have been independently found in this work ( cfht  9 , 10 , 12 - 14 ) . among the other 10 new members ,",
    "six objects were not found in my survey because they have spectral types of @xmath44m6 according to my classifications , and thus are outside of the range of spectral types for which my search criteria were designed .",
    "the one new member from g06 that was not included in my spectroscopic sample , cfht  19 , also has a type earlier than m6 according to g06 .",
    "the other three new cfht sources that were not found in my survey were discussed earlier in this section . using their spectroscopy , g06 classified 12 of their 17 new members as @xmath39m6 , and thus likely to be substellar . in comparison ,",
    "the spectral types measured in this work for those sources are earlier than the classifications from g06 by an average of 0.5 subclass . as a result",
    ", i find that only 6/17 of the cfht sources from g06 are later than m6 .",
    "i now evaluate the completeness of the survey by g06 .",
    "they identified 47 objects with photometry indicative of taurus members with spectral types of @xmath47m4 .",
    "these sources included the four members presented by @xcite and 17 previously known members .",
    "g06 obtained spectra of 20 of the 26 remaining candidates , which included all of the candidates at @xmath39m6 . as a result , they reported a completeness of 41/47 , or 87% , for taurus members at @xmath47m4 and a completeness of 100% for candidates at @xmath39m6 , both for @xmath48  @xmath49 , @xmath45 , and ages of @xmath50  myr .",
    "however , these percentages do not fully characterize completeness because they did not account for the completeness of the candidate list itself , or the percentage of members that were identified as candidates , which g06 did not estimate . as a simple test of their completeness",
    ", i have investigated whether any known members of taurus with spectral types of @xmath47m4 are within their survey fields but not recovered by their selection criteria . from published membership lists for taurus @xcite , i have identified 38 such sources : mho  4 - 9 , v927  tau , rxj04467 + 2459 , cida  1 , 2 and 7 , j1 - 507 , j1 - 665 , j1 - 4423 , iras",

    "34 and 11 have spectral types of m4-m6 and @xmath39m6 , respectively . in comparison , the total sample of members recovered by @xcite and g06 ( both previously known and new ones ) consisted of 17 and 19 objects in those spectral type ranges .",
    "thus , the completeness of g06 was at best 17/51 ( 33% ) and 19/30 ( 63% ) at m4-m6 and @xmath39m6 .",
    "the true completeness at m4-m6 is probably lower because neither g06 nor any other survey has demonstrated that the known census of members in this range of spectral types is complete for the area considered by g06 . on the other hand",
    ", their completeness at @xmath39m6 may not be much lower than the upper limit computed here given that my survey was designed to find members of this kind , and has a reasonably high level of completeness for m6-m9 and @xmath45 , as shown earlier in this section .",
    "the reason for the high level of incompleteness in the survey by g06 is explored in figure  [ fig : jh ] , which compares @xmath51 versus @xmath17 for the 36 recovered members and the 45 missed members .",
    "all but one of the missed members span a range of colors that is similar to , or even smaller on average than , the recovered members , indicating that the former objects were not missed because of higher extinction . instead , the missed members are systematically brighter than the recovered members , and thus",
    "may have been saturated in the images of g06 and consequently overlooked .",
    "my 225  deg@xmath0 survey of taurus was designed to identify members in the same ranges of spectral types ( m6-m9 ) and extinctions ( @xmath45 ) as exhibited by the previously known late - type members that were found in surveys of smaller fields . as shown in the previous section ,",
    "the completeness of this survey is not 100% for those ranges of types and extinctions , but it appears to be high enough that the combination of the new members that i have found and the previously known members should comprise an accurate representation of the substellar population of taurus that is unbiased with position . in this section , i examine the spatial distribution of that population .    a map of the positions of all known members of taurus is shown in figure  [ fig : map2 ] , where the objects with spectral types of @xmath44m6 ( @xmath52  @xmath49 ) and @xmath39m6 ( @xmath53  @xmath49 ) are plotted with different symbols .",
    "a large , extended population of brown dwarfs between the stellar aggregates does not exist .",
    "instead , the spatial distribution of brown dwarfs in taurus closely resembles that of the stellar members , which is consistent with previous surveys of smaller areas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* g06 ) .    to search for subtle differences in the distributions of stars and brown dwarfs in taurus in their surveyed fields ,",
    "g06 computed the number ratio of brown dwarfs to stars for areas of varying radii from the stellar aggregates , which is quantified as @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "they found that this ratio increased with radii .",
    "for instance , g06 measured @xmath55 for their full survey area , whereas @xcite reported a value of 0.18 for smaller fields surrounding some of the aggregates .",
    "g06 presented these results as evidence for differences in the spatial distributions of stars and brown dwarfs in taurus .",
    "however , as discussed in   [ sec : complete ] , the spectral types reported by g06 for the cfht sources are systematically later than the ones that i measured for those objects . if my spectral types are adopted instead , which are based on the classification system used for most of the previously known late - type members @xcite , then six cfht objects become stars rather than brown dwarfs ( @xmath44m6 , cfht  7 - 12 ) and the ratio computed by g06 becomes 0.17 , which is consistent with the value for the smaller fields . in other words , the apparent increase in @xmath56 with radius reported by g06 was simply a reflection of differences in the spectral classification systems used for their ( outer ) cfht sources and the ( inner ) previously known members . however , even if the measurement of @xmath56 by g06 is revised to use my spectral types for the cfht sources , it still may not accurately represent the taurus population because , as shown in the previous section , their survey was significantly incomplete for members at @xmath47m4 , which applies to both the numerator and denominator in @xmath56 and thus precludes a meaningful ratio .",
    "although the combination of previous surveys and the one in this work provide a census of brown dwarfs that has fairly high completeness for m6-m9 and @xmath45 across all of taurus , i do not attempt to measure @xmath56 for the entire star - forming region because no study has quantified the completeness of the known census of low - mass stars ( m2-m6 ) for this area .",
    "this issue was raised by @xcite , who pointed out that the faint limits of the wide - field x - ray and h@xmath37 surveys ( @xmath57m4 ) do not clearly overlap with the bright limits of deep ccd surveys , which range from m4 to m6 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , one of the objects found in my survey , 2mass  04161885 + 2752155 ( m6.25 ) , is within one of the fields observed by @xcite , but was not found in that study because it was saturated .",
    "paradoxically , the membership of taurus now is probably more complete for brown dwarfs than for low - mass stars because the latter have been too faint for x - ray surveys , frequently saturated in ccd surveys , and not easily distinguished from background field stars in usno and 2mass data .",
    "as demonstrated above , a comparison of a ratio like @xmath56 with position ( or with any other parameter ) is sensitive to incompleteness and differences in spectral classification systems .",
    "to avoid the latter effect , one can examine the spatial distributions of stars and brown dwarfs in terms of the angular distances to the nearest stellar neighbors instead of @xmath56 .",
    "changing classification systems is equivalent to changing the boundary between the two samples in @xmath56 , which in turn will change quickly because the numerator and denominator are anti - correlated . in contrast , a sensitivity of this kind is not present in the distribution of neighbor distances because changing the boundary simply removes a few objects from one average and adds them to the other average . to mitigate the effect of incompleteness on the distribution of nearest neighbor distances ,",
    "i exclude the range of spectral types that has an uncertain level of completeness , namely m2-m6 .",
    "i have computed the distribution of nearest neighbor distances for the entire taurus star - forming region by using the census of taurus that combines the previously known members with the new ones found in this work .",
    "i consider only members with measured spectral types , which has the effect of excluding most of the class  0 and i sources . to measure the spatial distributions of unrelated members of taurus , the clustering of members of multiple systems should be avoided in this experiment .",
    "therefore , neighboring members with separations less than @xmath58 are treated as one object @xcite .",
    "the resulting samples at @xmath44m2 and @xmath39m6 contain 101 and 40 sources , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : histo ] , these two samples exhibit similar distributions of distances to the nearest stellar neighbor at @xmath44m2 .",
    "a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test of the two distributions indicates a probability of @xmath59% that they are drawn from the same parent distribution , and thus i find no statistically significant difference between the spatial distributions of stars and brown dwarfs in taurus .",
    "i arrive at the same result if a different boundary for the hydrogen burning mass limit is adopted , such as m5 or m7 , or if i ignore the potential incompleteness at m2-m6 and include these members in the stellar sample ( figure  [ fig : histo ] ) . for their survey area , g06 also found no significant difference between the distributions of nearest neighbor distances for members at @xmath44m6 and @xmath39m6 .",
    "to measure the spatial distribution of substellar members of taurus , i have performed a search for brown dwarfs across the entire star - forming region .",
    "the results of this work can be summarized as follows :    1 .   through analysis of photometry from the 2mass and usno - b1.0 catalogs for an area of 225  deg@xmath0 encompassing taurus ,",
    "i have identified 83 potential substellar members of the region .",
    "spectroscopy was performed on 15 of these candidates by @xcite , who classified seven of them as new members . among the 68 remaining candidates observed in this work ,",
    "i have identified 22 new members , five of which were independently discovered by g06 .",
    "sixteen of these 22 objects have spectral types later than m6 and thus are likely to be brown dwarfs according to the theoretical evolutionary models of @xcite and @xcite and the temperature scale of @xcite .",
    "2 .   among the candidates classified as non - members , three objects have late spectral types ( m8-l1 ) and spectral features that are suggestive of surface gravities between those of taurus members and typical field dwarfs .",
    "i speculate that these objects could be young members of the field ( @xmath36  myr ) .",
    "3 .   using the low - mass taurus members found in previous surveys ,",
    "i estimate that my survey has a completeness of @xmath43% for members with spectral types of @xmath39m6 to m9 and extinctions of @xmath45 .",
    "the same type of analysis demonstrates that the completeness of the recent survey by g06 is @xmath60% for this range of types .",
    "g06 concluded that the abundance of brown dwarfs relative to stars varies with distance from the stellar aggregates in taurus .",
    "i find that this apparent variation is a reflection of differences in the spectral classification systems used for low - mass members inside and outside of the aggregates .",
    "no variation is evident when spectral types for all objects are adopted from the same system .",
    "furthermore , a reliable measurement of the relative numbers of stars and brown dwarfs as a function of position in taurus is currently not possible because the available census of taurus members has an unknown level of completeness for low - mass stars ( m2-m6 , 0.1 - 0.6  @xmath61 ) for most of the region .",
    "5 .   after updating the census of taurus members with the new objects discovered in this work",
    ", i find that the spatial distribution of brown dwarfs closely follows that of the stars .",
    "an extended population of brown dwarfs outside of the stellar aggregates is not present .",
    "these results are consistent with a common formation mechanism for stars and brown dwarfs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and with some models for embryo ejection @xcite , but not others @xcite .",
