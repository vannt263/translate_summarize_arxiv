    "the two - dimensional euler equation on the plane can be written in the vorticity form as follows @xmath0 the constant @xmath1 in the formula for @xmath2 can be dropped by time scaling but we write an equation this way on purpose to simplify the later calculations .",
    "the global in time regularity for the smooth initial data dates back to the paper by wolibner @xcite .",
    "the method of wolibner was based on the lagrange formulation of the problem but later other approaches were used ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "whatever method is used to establish the global regularity , one proves the upper bounds for the norms that measure the regularity of the solution and for the 2d euler all we know it that these norms grow in time not faster than the double exponential .",
    "the natural question is : are these estimates sharp ?",
    "this problem is of course of the same nature as the problem of the possible blow up for the 3d euler equation which is the central problem in the mathematical theory of fluids . in spite of its importance ,",
    "very little is known even in dimension two .",
    "for the two - dimensional torus , it was proved in @xcite that the vorticity gradient can indeed grow as double exponential for arbitrarily long ( but fixed ) time provided that it is large enough at time @xmath3 .",
    "this result , however , ( as well as any other known to the author ) did not reveal an intrinsic mechanism for the singularity formation but rather only indicated that the standard double exponential estimates can not be dramatically improved .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the scenario in which the singularity forms though we consider an easier problem , the problem of the patch evolution .",
    "the method we apply is quite general and can be tried for other evolution equations : 2d and 3d euler equations , surface quasi - geostrophic equation , etc .    the problem of patch evolution deals with the case when the initial data @xmath4 in ( [ euler - g ] ) is the characteristic function of some compact set .",
    "the initial data @xmath5 gives rise to globally defined unique solution thanks to the theory of yudovich @xcite . in our case",
    ", this compact set will be a centrally symmetric pair of two simply connected domains with smooth boundaries and thus the yudovich theory assures that the solution will always be the centrally symmetric pair of domains because the euler evolution on the plane preserves the central symmetry .",
    "the main question we address here is : how does the geometry of these domains change in time ?",
    "this problem attracted a lot of attention in both physics and mathematical literature in the last several decades and became a classical one . in @xcite",
    ", chemin proved that if the boundary of the patch is sufficiently regular then it will retain the same regularity forever ; another proof of that fact was given later by bertozzi and constantin @xcite .",
    "we recommend the wonderful books @xcite for introduction to the subject and for simplified proofs .",
    "another model which became quite fashionable lately is the so - called surface quasi - geostrophic equation ( sqg for the shorthand ) .",
    "it is different from the euler equation ( [ euler - g ] ) only in the definition of the velocity : @xmath6 ( for sqg ) vs. @xmath7 ( for 2d euler ) , i.e. , the kernel used in convolution is more singular . only the local in time",
    "existence of the regular solutions is known for the smooth initial data and there is a conjecture that the blow up happens in finite time .",
    "the patch evolution for the sqg was also extensively studied and there is a numerical evidence and widely accepted belief that the patch with smooth boundary can develop the singularity in finite time ( see , e.g. , @xcite and related @xcite ) .",
    "the idea behind it is based on the expectation that the stronger the singularity of the kernel is , the faster the process of the singularity formation is supposed to be and since this process should be nonlinear in nature the blow up can supposedly happen in finite time .",
    "that mechanism , however , has never been justified or even explained .    in this paper , we present the scenario in which the singularity of the kernel plays the major role in the speed of the blow up formation however we have the proof only for the case of 2d euler . as we mentioned already ,",
    "the patch dynamics for 2d euler can not go wild in finite time so we are looking for the situation when the geometry goes singular at @xmath8 .",
    "the latter can be described in various ways : growth in time of the curvature , perimeter , etc . in this paper , we focus on one particular geometric characteristic , the distance between two interacting patches , and show that it can decay as double exponential infinitely in time .",
    "the estimates we obtain are sharp so in some sence our results are optimal . that , however , comes with the price as we need to impose the strain whose main purpose is to prevent the bulk of the patches from going into chaotic regime .",
    "this will be explained later .    to state the main result",
    "we need to introduce some notation first .",
    "let @xmath9 , i.e. , the image of @xmath10 under the central symmetry . the boundary of @xmath10 will be denoted by @xmath11 . in @xmath12 , we consider the 2d euler dynamics given by the initial configuration @xmath13 where @xmath14 will be defined later .",
    "the areas of patches , the distance between them , the value of vorticity  all these quantities are of order one as @xmath3 .",
    "the curve @xmath15 is smooth and its curvature is of order one as well .",
    "as time evolves , the euler evolution deforms @xmath16 to a new pair @xmath17 with @xmath18 because the flow preserves the area and the central symmetry .",
    "these new patches will be separated from each other for all times , i.e. @xmath19 , but the question , however , is how small the distance between them can get ? to answer this question we need to account for the following well - known fact first .",
    "if one considers the model of euler evolution of two identical point vortices on the the plane , then the dynamics is quite simple : the vortices will rotate with constant angular velocity @xcite .",
    "that suggests that two symmetric patches will tend to  rotate \" until some chaotic regime will homogenize them to the state which is hard to control and there is a numerical evidence that this chaotic regime does occur for many @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "so , to avoid this chaotic behavior of our contours ( and we need to control them for all @xmath20 ! ) , one needs to impose the strain which will factor out the intrinsic rotation but which will also be regular enough to not significantly influence the nonlinear mechanism for the singularity formation .",
    "therefore , it is very natural to switch from the original problem to the following one @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is sufficiently regular incompressible strain .",
    "the analytical perspective ( and this is our way to think about the problem ) is that the solution @xmath24 to ( [ euler - g1 ] ) we will obtain can be regarded as an approximate solution to the original problem ( [ euler - g ] ) .",
    "now we are ready to state the main result of the paper .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath25 .",
    "then , there is a simply connected domain @xmath14 with smooth boundary satisfying @xmath26 , and a time - dependent compactly supported incompressible odd strain @xmath27 such that @xmath28 where @xmath17 is the euler dynamics of @xmath13 in the presence of the strain @xmath23 , i.e. the solution to ( [ euler - g1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , for @xmath23 we have @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    * remark 1 . *",
    "as it will be clear from the proof , these contours will touch each other at @xmath8 and the touching point is at the origin . in the local coordinates around the origin the functions parameterizing the contours converge to @xmath32 in a self - similar way which will be described in detail .",
    "* remark 2 . *",
    "the simple modification of the yudovich theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) implies that the patch evolution given by ( [ euler - g1 ] ) is uniquely defined provided that @xmath23 satisfies ( [ log - lip ] ) and is uniformly bounded , the latter is warranted by ( [ lip ] ) . since",
    "our strain @xmath33 is divergence - free and odd , this dynamics will also preserve the area and the central symmetry .",
    "the latter , in particular , implies that the origin is the stationary point for the dynamics . in the corollary [ cont - l ] below",
    ", we will give the lower bound on the distance of any particle trajectory to the origin .",
    "this estimate will prove that the theorem [ main ] is essentially sharp .",
    "now , we need to explain why the strain we add is indeed a small correction from the dynamical perspective .",
    "this will be done in the following elementary lemma .",
    "we will show that under the @xmath33strain alone no point can approach the origin in the rate faster than exponential as long as assumption ( [ lip ] ) is made and so it is the nonlinear term @xmath34 in ( [ euler - g1 ] ) that produces the `` double exponentially '' fast singularity formation .",
    "[ easy ] let @xmath23 be an odd vector field that satisfies ( [ lip ] ) and ( [ log - lip ] ) .",
    "consider @xmath35 which solves @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a compact set .",
    "then , @xmath39    clearly ( [ transport ] ) is a transport equation and we have @xmath40 for the characteristics @xmath41 .",
    "it has the unique solution ( see lemma 3.2 , page 67 , @xcite ) due to log - lipschitz regularity ( [ log - lip ] ) . as @xmath23 is odd , @xmath42 and",
    "so the origin is a stationary point .",
    "the estimate ( [ lip ] ) yields @xmath43 therefore , @xmath44 and @xmath45 this implies ( [ lbnew ] ) as the patch @xmath46 is convected by the flow .",
    "next , we will show that the theorem [ main ] is essentially sharp on the double exponential scale . to explain that , we need the next lemma . as a motivation",
    "let us start with two simple questions : if we are given a patch @xmath10 of area @xmath47 such that the velocity generated by @xmath10 is zero at the origin , how large can the radial component of the velocity be in the fixed point close to the origin ?",
    "how should we choose @xmath10 to get the maximum ( or get close to the maximum ) of this value ?",
    "clearly , we are interested in the radial component since it is the one which will push the points to the origin or away from it .",
    "as the problem is invariant under the rotation , we can take @xmath48 without loss of generality .",
    "[ shest ] assume that the set @xmath10 is such that @xmath49 and @xmath50 then , @xmath51 and @xmath52    this estimate is standard , see lemma  8.1 from @xcite , pages  315318 .",
    "indeed , @xmath53 we have @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 for @xmath57 , after scaling by @xmath58 , @xmath59    [ clara ] for fixed @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 where @xmath62 ^ 2 $ ]    the proof is a direct calculation in the polar coordinates .    in particular , these results give the leading term for the size of radial component of the velocity field generated by the centrally symmetric configuration of patches since for this configuration the velocity is always zero at the origin . we also see that the  cross configuration \" , i.e. , @xmath63 , gives the optimal value up to an additive constant",
    ". this configuration will also play a major role in the proof of theorem [ main ] .",
    "we can immediately apply two previous results to the problem of patch dynamics .",
    "[ cont - l ] under the conditions of the theorem [ main ] , we have @xmath64 where @xmath65 depends on the constant in ( [ lip ] ) and on the initial distance between the contours .",
    "indeed , for the trajectory @xmath66 we have @xmath67 which implies ( [ lower - ah ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath68 from the theorem [ main ] as well as the constant one in front of @xmath69 in ( [ lower - ah ] ) can be changed by a simple rescaling ( i.e. , by multiplying the value of vorticity by a constant which is the same as scaling the time ) thus the size of @xmath68 is small only when compared to the parameters of the problem .",
    "* remark 3 .",
    "* the optimality up to a constant of @xmath70 in ( [ optima ] ) is the reason why our estimate in the theorem [ main ] is essentially sharp on the double exponential scale .",
    "clearly , one can replace @xmath70 by any other configuration as long as it forms a corner of @xmath71 at the origin .    in @xmath72 , in contrast to @xmath73 ,",
    "the kernel of @xmath74 is easier to write and @xmath74 can be defined on compactly supported @xmath75 functions so we will address the problem on the whole plane rather than on @xmath73 . on the 2d torus , similar results hold .",
    "the interaction of two vortices was extensively studied in the physics literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the merging mechanism was discussed in @xcite where some justifications ( both numerical and analytical ) were given . in our paper , we provide rigorous analysis of that process and obtain the sharp bounds .    in @xcite , the authors study an interesting question of the  sharp front \" formation .",
    "loosely speaking , the sharp front forms if , for example , two level sets of vorticity , each represented by a smooth time - dependent curve , converge to a fixed smooth arc as @xmath76 .",
    "let the  thickness \" of the front be denoted by @xmath77 . in @xcite , the following estimate for 2d euler dynamics is given ( see theorem 3 , p. 4312 ) @xmath78 with constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 depending only on the geometry of the front .",
    "the scenario considered in our paper is different as the singularity forms at a point .",
    "the idea of the proof comes from the following very natural question .",
    "consider an active - scalar dynamics @xmath81 where @xmath79 is the convolution with a kernel @xmath82 .",
    "in some interesting cases , @xmath83 with @xmath84 so @xmath85 is positive and smooth away from the origin .",
    "it also obeys some symmetries inherited from its symbol on the fourier side , e.g. , is radially symmetric .",
    "perhaps , the most interesting cases are @xmath86 ( 2d euler ) , which is treated in this paper , and @xmath87 ( sqg ) already mentioned in the text . if one considers the problem ( [ active - sc ] ) with @xmath83 on the 2d torus @xmath88 ^ 2 $ ] , then there is a stationary singular weak solution ( the author learned about this solution from @xcite ) , a `` cross '' @xmath89 where @xmath90 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath91\\times [ 0,\\pi]$ ] .",
    "one can think about two patches touching each other at the origin and each forming the right angle .",
    "this picture is also centrally symmetric .",
    "now , the question is : is this configuration stable ?",
    "in other words , can we perturb these patches a little so that they will converge to the stationary solution at least around the origin at @xmath76 ?",
    "the flow generated by @xmath92 is hyperbolic and so is unstable .",
    "however , if one places a curve into the stationary hyperbolic flow in such a way that its part follows the separatrix of the flow in the attracting direction , then the time evolution of this curve will produce a sharp corner .",
    "the problem of course is that the actual flow is induced by the patch itself and so it will be changing in time .",
    "that suggests that one has to be very careful with the choice of the initial patch to guarantee that this process is self - sustaining .",
    "nevertheless , that seems possible and thus the mechanism of singularity formation through the hyperbolic flow can probably be justified .",
    "we do it here by neglecting the smaller order terms . in general",
    ", the application of some sort of fixed point argument seems to be needed .",
    "either way , this scenario is a zero probability event ( at least the way the proof goes ) if the `` random '' initial condition is chosen .",
    "however , if one wants to see merging for a long but fixed time , then this can be achieved for an open set of initial data so from that perspective our construction is realistic .",
    "we will handle the case @xmath86 only without trying to make the strain smooth .",
    "the question whether one can choose @xmath93 seems to be the right one to address ( rather than trying to make @xmath94 ) and we formulate it as an    * open problem . *",
    "_ can one take the strain @xmath23 in the theorem [ main ] to be infinitely smooth ? _",
    "if the answer is yes , then one can view this strain as the incompressible flow generated by the some background or another patch far away which is decoupled from the evolution of our symmetric pair ( that of course is yet another approximation among many others made in the area of fluid dynamics ) .",
    "it is not easy for us to imagine how to get rid of the strain completely for the 2d euler model if one wants to prove the sharp estimate on the rate of merging . for other models like sqg ,",
    "this is not ruled out as one has to control the bulk of the patches only for finite time and for this finite time the chaotic regime might not be able to start influencing the picture .",
    "solving the open problem stated above might require closure of the fixed point argument outlined above .",
    "we were able to do that so far only for the model equation where the convolution kernel is a smooth bump .",
    "surprisingly , the analysis needed to justify the self - sustaining process we discussed is reminiscent to what one has to do to prove the homogenization in the 2d euler for @xmath76 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is technically hard and has never been carried out .",
    "there is yet another argument indicating that the answer to the open problem above is positive . in @xcite , the existence of very interesting @xmath95-shapes",
    "is mentioned ( no proofs though ) .",
    "the @xmath95-shape is a patch that rotates with the constant angular velocity under the 2d euler dynamics .",
    "saffman indicates that there is a continuous parametric curve of these @xmath95-shapes , each represented by a pair of centrally symmetric patches with smooth boundary .",
    "the endpoint of this curve however is represented by a pair of centrally symmetric patches that touch each other at the origin and form a sharp corner there ( a singularity we want to produce dynamically ) .",
    "it would be interesting to prove existence of this curve and show that the dynamics representing the evolution of our patch can move across these  invariant sets \" ( i.e. , the particular @xmath95shapes ) thus approaching the endpoint of this parametric curve locally around the origin",
    ". that would be consistent with the self - sustaining scenario we want to understand .    for @xmath96 , one can show that the merging happens but the attraction to the origin is only exponential .",
    "this case is much easier as the convolution kernel is not singular anymore so , for example , one can take the strain to be exponentially decaying in time .    for @xmath97 , we expect our technique to show that the contours can touch each other in finite time thus proving the outstanding problem of blow up for @xmath87 .",
    "this , however , will require serious refinement of the method .",
    "there are other stationary singular weak solutions known for 2d euler dynamics and for other problems in fluid mechanics",
    ". it would be interesting to perform analogous stability analysis for each of them with the goal of , e.g. , solving the problems of blow up . from that perspective",
    "the idea is quite general : find the singular stationary solution which generates the  hyperbolic dynamics \" and construct the stable manifold around it which will belong to the functional space of high regularity . for the  true \" 2d euler or sqg one can try some modification of the same  cross configuration \" .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the sections 2 , 3 , and 4 , we prove some auxiliary results .",
    "the section 5 contains the construction of @xmath98 and the proof of the theorem [ main ] . in appendix",
    ", we find an approximate self - similar solution to the local equation of curve s evolution .",
    "in this section , we consider the velocity field generated by one particular pair of patches which resembles around the origin the limiting ( @xmath99 ) configuration of the dynamics described in theorem [ main ] . in @xmath72 , take @xmath100 , where @xmath62 ^ 2 $ ] . recall that in the case of @xmath73 analogous configuration ( [ crosss ] ) is a steady state .",
    "let @xmath101 , the other cases can be treated using the symmetry of the problem .",
    "we have @xmath102 integrating , we have for the first component @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 are odd and smooth around the origin . integrating by parts , we get the following expression for the integral @xmath106 by symmetry , for the second component of the gradient we have @xmath107 thus , the velocity is @xmath108 around the origin , where @xmath109 .",
    "the correction @xmath110 has a bounded gradient in @xmath111 and so it belongs to the lipschitz class .",
    "this ensures that the first term in ( [ ididi ] ) is log - lipschitz .",
    "consider a positive function @xmath112 on the unit circle @xmath113 , @xmath71-periodic , smooth , @xmath114 , and such that @xmath115 define the following potential : @xmath116 clearly , @xmath117 is homogeneous of order one and @xmath118 where @xmath119 is log - lipschitz and @xmath120    it is sufficient to handle @xmath101 .",
    "one can write @xmath121 then , it is a direct calculation to check that @xmath122 was made only to simplify the calculations below .",
    "we will focus later on the first term in ( [ rs1 ] ) as the second one has a smaller size and will be absorbed into the strain later ( see the formulation of the main theorem ) .",
    "the level sets of @xmath123 around the origin are hyperbolas asymptotically . indeed , take @xmath124 and consider @xmath125 or @xmath126 and so the second and the third terms are small as @xmath127 provided that @xmath128 .    for the velocity , @xmath129 within the sector @xmath130 ,",
    "the formula for the gradient is more complicated but we will see later that the part of the patch s boundary that belongs to this sector will not have a significant contribution to the velocity and so very rough estimates will suffice .",
    "these formulas show that the flow generated by @xmath123 is hyperbolic around the origin .",
    "moreover , the attraction and repelling is double exponential .",
    "for example , the point @xmath131 will have a trajectory @xmath132 . in the next section",
    ", we will study the cauchy problem associated to this flow .",
    "* remark 2 . * later on we will also need to handle the vector field generated by the  smoothed cross configuration \" .",
    "suppose we have a small parameter @xmath133 and @xmath134 then , for @xmath135 , the direct calculation analogous to the one done in lemma [ shest ] yields @xmath136",

    "thus ( [ e5 ] ) can be written as @xmath543 where @xmath544 going back to ( [ back ] ) and choosing @xmath65 appropriately ( @xmath545 ) , one wants to make the following choice for @xmath133 and @xmath507 : @xmath546 take for @xmath547 one particular solution @xmath548 the equation for @xmath507 we had before ( see ( [ oldstory ] ) ) and so we have @xmath549 and its solution @xmath507 trivially satisfies assumptions ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) mentioned above .",
    "for the original equation ( [ for1 ] ) , the error one gets after substituting @xmath550 amounts to @xmath551 where @xmath552 and @xmath553 therefore , for @xmath554 , @xmath555 and @xmath556 .",
    "thus , we see that the error is small again so it is possible to find the approximate solution with the self - similar scaling that holds on the ball of size @xmath47 .",
    "we are not trying to make this picture global and define the incompressible strain on the whole @xmath72 which corresponds to the error @xmath551 but we believe it is possible .",
