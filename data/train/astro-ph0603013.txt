    "blazars are a class of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with collimated plasma outflows ( jets ) directed along the line of sight .",
    "the jets give rise to a continuum emission extending from the radio to x - rays , sometimes even into the mev and gev / tev energy range .",
    "the blazar 1es 1959 + 650 is one of ten blazars detected so far in the gev / tev energy range with ground based cherenkov telescopes @xcite . with a redshift @xmath1 0.047 @xcite , it is further away from us than the two strongest tev @xmath0-ray sources mrk 421 ( @xmath1 0.031 ) and mrk 501 ( @xmath1 0.034 ) but substantially closer than the recently detected tev emitters h  2356 - 309 ( @xmath1 0.165 ) and 1es 1101 - 232 ( @xmath1 0.186 ) .    in the year 2002 , 1es 1959 + 650 went into a state of high tev @xmath0-ray activity @xcite and was observed intensively with good multiwavelength coverage ( @xcite , called `` paper i '' in the following ) .",
    "the source showed very hard x - ray energy spectra with 3 - 25 kev photon indices @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) between 1.6 and 2.4 ( paper i ) .",
    "the fact that its spectral energy distribution peaks sometimes at energies well above 15 kev makes the source one of the most extreme synchrotron blazars , similar to mrk 501 @xcite and 1h 1426 + 428 @xcite .",
    "the time - averaged tev @xmath0-ray energy spectrum from the flaring period of 2002 has been fitted with a power law model , giving a photon index @xmath2 of 2.8 over the energy range from 316 gev to 10 tev @xcite .",
    "although the tev @xmath0-ray spectrum of 1es 1959 + 650 is steeper than that of mrk 501 in its high state ( @xmath4 ) @xcite , the difference may be entirely caused by the larger redshift of the source and hence the larger extent of extragalactic absorption in pair production processes of the tev @xmath0-rays with photons from the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the source showed an `` orphan '' flare ( a flare in the tev @xmath0-ray band without a corresponding flare in the x - ray band ) on june 4 , 2002 .",
    "while the tev flux increased from 0.26@xmath50.21 times the flux to the crab nebula to about 4 times the flux of the crab nebula within 5 hrs , the x - ray flux , x - ray photon index , and the optical brightness stayed approximately constant .",
    "this 2002 observation challenges simple one - zone synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) models where the x - rays originate as synchrotron emission of a single relativistic electron population and the tev @xmath0-rays are produced from inverse compton scattering of the synchrotron photons by the same population of electrons .",
    "paper i discusses several possible explanations for the orphan flare : multiple emission zones contributing to the observed radiation , time variable external seed photons fields for inverse compton processes , an ordered magnetic field aligned with the jet axis , and hadronic rather than leptonic emission models . in a more recent paper ,",
    "@xcite studied the possibility that the orphan flare originated from relativistic protons ( @xmath6 ) in @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xmath11 processes inside the jet as the protons interacted with jet photons backscattered into the jet by a cloud several parsecs from the central engine .",
    "he finds that reasonable variations in the values of the model parameters explain all the data satisfactorily .",
    "a recent twist in the story of the orphan flare is its possible association with a @xmath12tev neutrino detected by the amanda neutrino telescope from the direction of 1es 1959 + 650 in temporal coincidence , however , the statistical significance can not be reliably estimated @xcite .",
    "if 1es 1959 + 650 indeed emitted high energy neutrinos , purely leptonic synchrotron - compton models would be ruled out .    in this paper",
    "we report on multiwavelength observations of 1es 1959 + 650 performed between may 2 , 2003 and june 7 , 2003 . during the week",
    "preceding our observations , the _ all sky monitor _ on board of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ satellite measured an elevated 2 - 12 kev flux on the order of 10 mcrab .",
    "we therefore invoked pointed _",
    "rxte _ observations and accompanying observations with the whipple 10 m cherenkov telescope , the bordeaux optical telescope , and the university of michigan radio astrophysical observatory ( umrao ) .",
    "while the tev @xmath0-ray observations did not reveal any major tev @xmath0-ray flare and the radio and optical data did not show significant flux variability , we did acquire an x - ray data set with light curves and energy spectra with high signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we will discuss the data sets in section  [ gutierrez : data ] , and present the multiwavelength light curves in section  [ gutierrez : results ] .",
    "we study the secular evolution , i.e.  long term evolution , of the x - ray / tev @xmath0-ray flux correlation and the x - ray flux versus x - ray spectral hardness correlation in section  [ gutierrez : corr ] .",
    "we study the spectral energy density ( sed ) and fit it with a ssc model in section  [ gutierrez : sed ] .",
    "we summarize and discuss the results in section  [ gutierrez : discussion ] , focusing on a very interesting result from the x - ray observations : a secular evolution of the possible x - ray flux versus x - ray photon index correlation . throughout the paper",
    "we will compare results from 2003 with those obtained in 2002 ( paper i ) and in earlier observations in 2000 @xcite . in the following",
    ", fit results are given in the text and in the tables with 90% confidence interval errors ; in figures , we show 1 @xmath13 error bars and 90% confidence level upper limits computed with the method described in @xcite .",
    "observations were taken with the university of michigan radio astrophysical observatory ( umrao ) between may 2 and june 29 , 2003 , with the bordeaux optical telescope between june 7 and october 18 , 2003 , and with the x - ray satellite _ rxte _ and the whipple 10  m cherenkov telescope between may 2 and june 7 , 2003 .",
    "our x - ray observations added 34.5  ks of integration time to the 2000 data from @xcite and the 2002 data from paper i which we reanalyzed here .",
    "the tev @xmath0-ray data comprise 13.1 hrs .",
    "detailed descriptions of the data cleaning and analysis procedures are given in paper i and in @xcite .",
    "for the x - ray analysis , we use here the ` ftools `  v5.3.1 package for data cleaning and the ` sherpa `  v.3.0.1 package for spectral fitting . power law and broken power law models",
    "were fitted over the energy range from 4 to 15 kev , using a galactic neutral hydrogen column density of 1.01  @xmath14  @xmath15 we exclude here the 3 - 4 kev data , as past experience has shown that it has a somewhat lower reliability than the 4 - 15 kev data .",
    "we limit the analysis of individual _ rxte _ pointings to @xmath1615 kev ( rather than to @xmath1625 kev as in paper i ) , as the 15 - 25 kev band is dominated by poissonian background fluctuations for the `` low flux '' data sets from 2000 and 2003 .",
    "we quote tev fluxes as integral fluxes in units of the flux from the crab nebula .",
    "given the zenith angle range of the observations , the peak energy - ray detection rate peaks , assuming a source with the same spectrum as the crab nebula .",
    "] of the flux measurements lies at 600 gev .",
    "based on the whipple measurements of the energy spectrum from the crab nebula @xcite , a flux of 1 crab corresponds to a 1 tev @xmath17 flux of ( 5.12@xmath50.27@xmath18@xmath5@xmath19 ) @xmath20 ergs @xmath15 s@xmath21 .",
    "we briefly discuss here the light curves proceeding from short wavelengths to long wavelengths .",
    "the tev @xmath0-ray data ( figure  [ fig1]a ) shows mostly upper limits .",
    "the observations did not reveal strong flares . analyzing the entire tev @xmath0-ray data",
    "set , the significance of the @xmath0-ray signal over the 2 months observation was 3.3 @xmath13 with a @xmath0-ray rate of @xmath22 crab units .",
    "thus even on the longest accessible time scales , we have only marginal evidence for tev @xmath0-ray emission from the source .",
    "the large `` gap '' in the @xmath0-ray light curve corresponds to the full moon period when cherenkov telescopes can not be operated in standard mode and some additional down - time owing to bad weather .",
    "+ the 10  kev x - ray flux ( figure  [ fig1]b ) varies by a factor of 3.4 over the course of the observations .",
    "the x - ray flux seems to be correlated with the 415  kev photon index @xmath2 ( figure  [ fig1]c ) in the sense that higher fluxes are accompanied by harder energy spectra .",
    "+ we do not show the optical data in figure  [ fig1 ] as only one observation was taken during the multiwavelength campaign . during this one observation ,",
    "the v - band optical magnitude was @xmath23  mag .",
    "the majority of optical observations were taken after the multiwavelength campaign . the flux measured during 54 nights between jun .  7 and oct .  18 , 2003 , varied between 14.89  mag and 15.67  mag with an average of @xmath24  mag .",
    "during the 2002 flaring phase , the v - band magnitudes varied between 15.4  mag and 15.7 mag ( paper i ) .",
    "the combined 2002 and 2003 data thus show no evidence for correlation between the major x - ray / tev @xmath0-ray flaring phases and emission levels in the optical .",
    "the 14.5  ghz and 4.8  ghz radio data are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1]d and [ fig1]e respectively .",
    "we do not show here the 8  ghz data as it consists only of two data points .",
    "the radio data do not show significant evidence for flux variability and the observed values are consistent with those measured earlier ( paper i , @xcite ) .",
    "the data show that the fractional flux variability of 1es 1959 + 650 in the radio band is 10% or less .",
    "radio observations with higher sensitivity are needed to access any correlation between the radio fluxes and the x - ray or tev @xmath0-ray fluxes .",
    "the correlation between simultaneously measured tev @xmath0-ray and x - ray fluxes during the 2002 and 2003 observation campaigns are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the 2002 x - ray points are from our re - analysis of the data presented in paper i. while the tev @xmath0-ray points are the same as in paper i , we converted here all fluxes with a statistical significance below 1.6 @xmath13 ( 90% confidence ) into upper limits .",
    "one can recognize that the main difference between the 2002 and 2003 observations is a lack of strong x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray flares during the 2003 observations .",
    "since both the x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray fluxes were lower in 2003 than in 2002 , the data also do not show evidence for a correlation .",
    "+ the x - ray flux versus x - ray photon index correlation is shown for the 2000 , 2002 , and 2003 data sets in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the fluxes and photon indices appear to be correlated for the 2002 data set , and to a lesser extend in the 2003 data set ; however , a secular evolution of the `` correlation '' can be recognized .",
    "for the same x - ray flux level , the energy spectrum was hardest during 2002 , the year of the large x - ray and tev @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "we studied this effect further with a detailed spectral analysis in three flux bands .",
    "the june 2003 data , the entire 2000 data set , and a significant part of the 2002 data fit within a low 10 kev flux band of 0.1 - 0.4@xmath25 @xmath15 s@xmath21 kev@xmath21 . a medium flux band was chosen similarly and encompasses the may 2003 data and a portion of the 2002 data . finally , a high flux state represents the flaring data in 2002 .",
    "details of the combined spectra in these flux bands is given in table  [ tab3 ] for the 2003 medium and 2002 high flux states the reduced @xmath26 values are significantly better for either a cutoff power - law or log - parabolic model than a simple power law .",
    "log - parabolic fits provide a direct way of calculating the peak in the total synchrotron spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the 4 - 15 kev spectral energy distributions from table  [ tab3 ] after applying a log - parabolic fit .",
    "the 2003 low and medium flux state give a peak synchrotron energy of 1.21@xmath50.64 kev and 1.09@xmath50.41 kev .    a similar short term relationship between the photon index and the flux",
    "was found for markarian 501 @xcite .",
    "we will discuss possible explanations for this type of secular evolution in section  [ gutierrez : discussion ] .",
    "in figure  [ fig5 ] we show the radio to @xmath0-ray sed of 1es 1959 + 650 together with results from simple one - zone ssc calculations .",
    "the ssc code @xcite assumes a spherical emission volume of radius @xmath27 moving with bulk lorentz factor @xmath28 toward the observer .",
    "the emission volume is filled with an isotropic electron population and a randomly oriented magnetic field @xmath29 .",
    "the energy spectrum of the electrons is assumed to be a broken power law from energy @xmath30 to @xmath31 with differential spectral indices ( @xmath32 from @xmath33 ) of 2 and 3 below and above the break energy @xmath34 .",
    "we use the cib model of @xcite to calculate extragalactic absorption of the tev @xmath0-rays in pair production processes .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows our ssc model with three different sets of parameter values , ( i ) the set of model parameter values from paper i that describes an sed observed during 2002 at intermediate flux levels , ( ii ) the same model parameter values adapted to fit the 2003 sed by reducing the @xmath34 and @xmath31 values ; and ( iii ) an alternative fit to the 2003 data allowing free variation of the parameter values .",
    "note that ( i ) and ( ii ) produce almost identical inverse compton components .",
    "the parameter values are summarized in table  [ tab6 ] . explaining the differences between the 2002 and 2003 sed with a change of @xmath34 and @xmath31 alone results in a rather low predicted tev @xmath0-ray flux",
    ". however , both ( ii ) and ( iii ) are consistent with the data",
    ". we will discuss the ssc model fits further in the next section .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the results of a multiwavelength campaign on the blazar 1es 1959 + 650 carried out in may and june 2003 , one year after the major flaring phase of 2002 .",
    "our campaign did not reveal a statistically significant tev @xmath0-ray flare and the highest x - ray fluxes observed during the 2003 campaign were lower by a factor of five than the highest fluxes observed in 2002 .",
    "contrasting the behavior of the source at high energies ( x - rays and @xmath0-rays ) , the optical and radio flux levels did not change from 2002 to 2003 .",
    "the lack of a correlation between the high - energy ( x - ray and @xmath0-ray ) and low - energy ( radio and optical ) flux levels observed in the years 2002 and 2003 suggest that the high - energy radiation is produced close to the central engine , and the low - energy radiation further downstream of the jet .",
    "indeed radio emission produced closer to the source would be self - absorbed and hence not visible .",
    "it is also possible that optical emission may come from `` old '' components that do not shine in x - rays anymore , but could in fact be closer to the central engine .",
    "the examination of a possible correlation between the tev @xmath0-ray flux and x - ray flux will benefit greatly from more sensitive cherenkov telescopes such as veritas or magic ( magic detected 1es  1959 + 650 in september and october 2004 in a state of low activity with a significance of 8.2 @xmath13 after @xmath12 6.0 hours of observations @xcite . ) + an interesting result from our campaign is that the 10 kev fluxes and 4 - 15 kev photon indices appear correlated during individual observation periods , but that the apparent correlation evolves on a time scale on the order of a year . in an initial attempt to identify whether a single model parameter might be responsible for the secular evolution , we varied individual ssc model parameters and studied the effect on a correlation between x - ray flux and photon index . comparing the correlations resulting from varying individual model parameters ( figure  [ fig6 ] ) with the apparent observed correlations ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) , one may speculate that individual flares on a time scale of days are caused by a variation of the doppler factor @xmath35 , the magnetic field @xmath29 , and/or @xmath34 and that the secular evolution of the source on a time scale of months is caused by a shift of the maximum energy @xmath31 to which electrons are accelerated . in a similar study of the blazar mrk 501 ( an object in many aspects similar to 1es 1959 + 650 ) , @xcite also identified @xmath31 as a likely parameter to cause long - term variations of the fluxes and energy spectra .",
    "the results discussed here should be taken with caution , as we can not exclude that several jet parameters change simultaneously from flare to flare and on longer time scales .",
    "+ recently , @xcite interpreted the flaring activity of agn as a red - noise process with significant power at low frequencies and a log - normal amplitude distribution . in this context ,",
    "hourly and daily variations are considered high frequency noise , and yearly variations low - frequency noise . as the discussion above shows , secular evolutions of the emission characteristics may be able to shed light on the physical origin of the `` power at low frequencies '' .",
    "long - term monitoring on time scales of years may thus be equally crucial for understanding the inner workings of agn jets as intensive observations on time scales of several weeks .",
