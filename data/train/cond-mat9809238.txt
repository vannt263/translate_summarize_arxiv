    "macroscopic phenomena far from equilibrium are ubiquitous and include phenomena such as turbulence in fluids , interface and growth problems , chemical reactions , biological processes , and even aspects of economical and sociological structures .    in recent years",
    "much of the focus of modern statistical physics and soft condensed matter has shifted towards such systems .",
    "drawing on the case of static and dynamic critical phenomena in and close to equilibrium , where scaling , critical exponents , and the concept of universality have so successfully served to organize our understanding and to provide a variety of calculational tools , a similar approach has been advanced towards the much larger class of nonequilibrium phenomena with the purpose of elucidating scaling properties and more generally the morphology or pattern formation in a driven state .    in this context",
    "the noisy burgers equation in one dimension provides maybe the simplest continuum description of an open driven nonlinear system exhibiting both scaling and pattern formation .",
    "this equation has the form ( @xcite ) @xmath1 and was in the noiseless case for @xmath2 originally proposed by burgers ( @xcite ) in order to model turbulence in fluids ; we note the similarity with the navier - stokes equation for @xmath3 .",

    "the burgers equation governs the local slope @xmath14 of a height field @xmath15 ( in the monge representation ) characterized by the much studied kardar - parisi - zhang equation ( @xcite ) @xmath16 in this case , which we shall adhere to in the following , @xmath7 is a diffusion coefficient or viscosity , @xmath9 a nonlinear lateral growth parameter , and @xmath10 represents noise in the drive or the environments . in fig .",
    "1 we have sketched the growth morphology in terms of the height and slope fields for a typical growing interface .",
    "( 1.0,0.7 ) ( 0.0,-0.4 )    the substantial conceptual problems encountered in nonequilibriumphysics are in many ways embodied in the burgers - kpz equations ( [ f1 ] ) and ( [ f4 ] ) describing the self - affine growth of an interface subject to annealed noise arising from fluctuations in the drive or in the environment .",
    "interestingly , the burgers - kpz equations are also encountered in a variety of other problems such as randomly stirred fluids , dissipative transport in a driven lattice gas , the propagation of flame fronts , the sine - gordon equation , and magnetic flux lines in superconductors .",
    "furthermore , by means of the cole- hopf transformation the burgers - kpz equations are also related to the problem of a directed polymer or a quantum particle in a random medium and thus to the theory of spin glasses ; see e.g. ( @xcite ) .",
    "one issue which has been addressed is the scaling properties of the noisy burgers equation . in fig .",
    "2 we have depicted how the width of the fluctuating interface ( see fig .",

( 1.0,0.4 ) ( 0.0,-0.8 )    this dynamical scaling hypothesis , which is substantiated by numerical modeling and renormalization group considerations , is embodied in the following relationship for the width : @xmath23 in terms of the height field itself or the associated slope field the appropriate dynamical scaling forms are given by @xmath24 ^ 2\\rangle = x^{2\\zeta}f_2(t / x^z )   \\enspace , \\label{f6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are reference points in an infinite system in the stationary regime and @xmath28 the scaling functions .",
    "the scaling issue thus amounts to a determination of the scaling exponents @xmath22 and @xmath20 together with the scaling functions @xmath28 .",
    "the hydrodynamical origin of the burgers equation , as reflected by the presence of the mode coupling or convective term @xmath8 , implies that the burgers equation is invariant under a galilean transformation @xmath29 involving a shift of the slope field . since the nonlinear coupling strength @xmath9 enters as a structural constant in the symmetry group it is invariant under scaling .",
    "this property implies a dynamical scaling law @xmath30 relating the roughness and dynamic exponents .",
    "another interesting property of the burgers equation specific to one dimension is the existence of an effective static fluctuation - dissipation theorem , in the sense that the stationary fokker - planck equation for the burgers equation is solved by a gaussian distribution @xmath31 } \\label{f11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the slope field _",
    "independent _ of the nonlinear coupling strength @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that the slope field @xmath32 performs independent gaussian fluctuations and that , consequently , the height field @xmath33 , performs random walk in @xmath34 , yielding the roughness exponent and from the scaling law ( [ f10 ] ) also the dynamic exponent . summarizing",
    ", the universality class for the burgers equation is characterized by the exponents : @xmath35 by a combination of the galilean invariance and the effective fluctuation - dissipation theorem specific to one dimension the exponents in one dimension are thus exactly known .",
    "the scaling function has also been accessed numerically and by a mode coupling approach . in higher dimensions",
    "the scaling properties of the burgers - kpz are controversial and remain to be clarified . in this context the dynamic renormalization group based on an expansion in @xmath36 and an expansion about the critical dimension @xmath37 yields limited results and in particular fails to access the strong coupling fixed point in @xmath38 , characterized by the exponents in ( [ f12 ] ) .    in a recent series of papers ( @xcite ) we have presented a novel approach to the strong coupling features of the noisy burgers equation in one dimension based on a nonperturbative approach in the asymptotic weak noise limit .",
    "since the singular character of the weak noise limit is an essential feature of our approach and is already apparent in the linear case for @xmath39 it is instructive first to consider this case .",
    "in the linear case for @xmath39 the burgers equation ( [ f1 ] ) takes the form of the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) equation ( for the slope field ) ( @xcite ) @xmath40 i.e. , a linear diffusion equation driven by conserved noise .    equation ( [ f13 ] )",

    "we note already here that the noise strength @xmath13 plays a special role .",
    "whereas @xmath13 enters linearly in the correlation function ( [ f15 ] ) , the limit @xmath58 appears as an `` essential singularity '' in the distribution functions @xmath47 and @xmath59 in ( [ f11 ] ) and ( [ f14 ] ) .",

    "we have here advanced a novel approach to the growth morphology and scaling behavior of the noisy burgers equation in one dimension . using the martin - siggia - rose ( msr ) technique in a canonical form",
    "we have demonstrated that the physics of the strong coupling fixed point is associated with an essential singularity in the noise strength and can be accessed by appropriate theoretical soliton techniques .    the canonical representation of the msr functional integral in terms of a feynman phase space path integral with a complex hamiltonian identifies the noise strength as the relevant small nonperturbative parameter and allows for _ a principle of least action_. in the asymptotic weak noise limit the leading contributions to the path integral are given by a dilute gas of solitons with superposed linear diffusive modes .",
    "the canonical variables are the local slope of the interface and an associated `` conjugate '' noise field , characteristic of the msr formalism . in terms of the local slope",
    "the soliton and diffusive mode picture provides a many - body description of a growing interface governed by the noisy burgers equation .",
    "the noise - induced slope fluctuations are here represented by the various paths or configurations contributing to the path integral .",
    "moreover , a spectral representation of the slope correlations based on the underlying `` quantum field theory '' gives access to the scaling exponents and provide a heuristic expression for the scaling function .",
    "so far the present nonperturbative approach has only been implemented in the one dimensional case where the analysis is tractable .",
    "however , the singular nature of the weak noise limit seems to be a general feature of the onset of the stationary regime and might also be important for the burgers - kpz equations in higher dimension .",
    "it remains to be investigated whether the present saddle point approach can be generalized to this case .",
