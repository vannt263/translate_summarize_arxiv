    "( 1999b ) have shown that a brightening supernova component to an afterglow light curve can be misinterpreted as being due to an underlying galaxy if the light curve is not sufficiently well - sampled at late times ( see also hjorth et al .",
    "1999 ) . lamb ( 1999 ) has shown that underlying galaxies that have been confirmed to be coincident with their afterglows by high - resolution , _ hst _ imaging are host galaxies to a high degree of certainty ; however , @xmath1 % of the remaining underlying galaxies are probably chance coincidences . consequently ,",
    "at least six of these underlying galaxies are host galaxies , and the remaining one or two underlying galaxies are very likely to be host galaxies as well .    since many ,",
    "if not all , of the long bursts with detected optical afterglows are associated with host galaxies , these afterglows are likely to be extinguished by dust in their host galaxies ( reichart 1997 ) , as well as by dust in our galaxy , and absorbed by h i in their host galaxies , as well as by the ly@xmath0 forest ( fruchter 1999a ) .",
    "these physical processes affect - in some cases , probably significantly - the observed spectra of afterglows from the infrared ( ir ) through the ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "for example , lamb & reichart ( 2000a , b ) suggest that some of the @xmath2 bursts with securely - detected x - ray afterglows , but without securely - detected optical afterglows , might be explained by large amounts of extinction by dust in their host galaxies , probably from the immediate vicinities of these bursts if they are indeed associated with star - forming regions ( see lamb & reichart 2000a for a discussion of the evidence in favor of this association ) , or by absorption by the ly@xmath0 forest if these bursts occur at very high redshifts ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "since the majority of afterglow observations are made at optical and near - infrared wavelengths , the effects of these physical processes on the observed spectra can not be ignored , particularly since these spectra have been redshifted .",
    "indeed , these effects must be carefully modeled if intrinsic spectra are to be recovered .",

    "we begin with this in  2 .",
    "also in  2 , we develop and present a formalism for the construction of bayesian prior probability distributions from multi - dimensional data sets , which we draw on extensively in  4 and  5 . in  3 , we present an eight - parameter dust extinction curve model , based on the work of fitzpatrick & massa ( 1988 ) and cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) . in  4",
    ", we construct a prior that weights this additional parameter space such that the volume of the solution space is reduced significantly , _ a priori _ , using fitted extinction curves from milky way and magellanic cloud lines of sight . in  5 , we present a two - parameter model of the ly@xmath0 forest flux deficit versus redshift distribution , and we construct an analogous prior using ly@xmath0 forest flux deficit measurements from quasar absorption line systems . in ",
    "6 , we present a wide variety of extinguished and absorbed spectral flux distributions , using these models . in  7",
    ", we draw conclusions , including a discussion of the broad applicability of these results to the modeling of light from all other extragalactic point sources .",
    "in  2.1 , we present a very general , bayesian inference formalism with which afterglow models ( and any other model for that matter ) can be tested , and with which the parameter values of acceptable models can be constrained , given the available photometry . in  2.2 , we develop and present a formalism for the construction of bayesian prior probability distributions from multi - dimensional data sets , which we draw on extensively in  4 and  5 . for a deeper discussion of bayesian inference , we refer the reader to an excellent review by loredo ( 1992 ) .        bayes theorem states : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hypothesis , or model , being considered , @xmath6 is the data , and @xmath7 is any available prior information .",

    ", we present an eight - parameter model that describes the effects of extinction by dust along the lines of sight to bursts ( and along the lines of sight to all extragalactic point sources for that matter ) .",
    "however , without a prior that weights this parameter space such that the volume of the solution space is reduced significantly , _ a priori _ , this model has very little predictive power .",
    "fortunately , a considerable amount of prior information - in the form of fitted values for six of these eight parameters from 166 measured milky way and magellanic cloud extinction curves , and fitted values for one of the two remaining parameters from 79 of these extinction curves - exists ; we describe this multi - dimensional data set in  4 . in this section ,",
    "we develop and present a formalism by which priors can be extracted from multi - dimensional data sets ; we draw on this formalism extensively in  4 and  5 .",
    "the extraction of a simply - formulated prior from , for example , the above , large , multi - dimensional data set greatly facilitates the incorporation of this prior information in future afterglow analyses .",
    "we begin with a sequence of four illustrative examples in  2.2.1 , the last three of which are particularly relevant to our construction of the dust extinction curve prior in  4 .      with the first example",
    ", we describe the form that the prior should take in the ideal case of one ( or more ) of the quantities in the data set being fully determined by other quantities in the data set , and of this relation between these quantities being either known or easily determined from the data set . with the second example",
    ", we describe the form that the prior should take in the less ideal case of this relation between these quantities existing , but of its existence not being known or easily determined from the data set , although correlations between subsets of these quantities are determinable from the data set . with the third example",
    ", we describe the form that the prior should take in the related case of this relation not being determinable from the data set because it involves quantities that are not in the data set , although correlations between the quantities that are in the data set , or subsets of these quantities , are determinable from the data set .",
    "this last example is particularly realistic in that one often deals with physical processes , like dust extinction , that , although understood in general , many of the details of which depend on quantities whose relevance has not even been postulated yet , let alone whose values have been measured . with the final example , we describe the form that the prior should take in the event that data selection effects , either due to instrumental limitations or due to how the sample was selected at a more human level , artificially constrain the values of quantities in the data set .",
    "we then discuss our generalization of these examples into a procedure .",

    "consequently , the measured values of the parameter @xmath22 should also be distributed as a gaussian , namely , @xmath72 . in this case ,",
    "the prior that best represents this data set is given by @xmath73 this prior weights the three - dimensional parameter space , consequently reducing the volume of the solution space to a localized region of a two - dimensional plane , _ a priori_.    [ [ example-2 . ] ] example 2 .",

    "another approach is to probe the data set mathematically .",
    "however , without prior knowledge of the form of the relation , let alone knowledge of its existence , this approach also can fail , particularly if the relation is non - linear in form .",
    "consequently , we now consider the form that the prior should take in the event that the relation @xmath67 is not known . in this case",
    ", one approach is to plot the data two parameters at a time .",
    "having done this , one would immediately notice that the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are strongly correlated , though it is unlikely that one would notice the weaker correlation between the parameters @xmath66 and @xmath22 , since the values of the parameter @xmath66 span a much smaller range than do the values of the parameter @xmath21 .",

    "when constructing a prior from a multi - dimensional data set in general , we adopt the following procedure : ( 1 ) we plot two- and sometimes three - dimensional subsets of the data to facilitate the identification of correlations between parameters ; ( 2 ) if correlations are found , say between pairs of parameters , we determine the two - dimensional distributions that describe these subsets of the data ; we also determine the one - dimensional distributions of the values of all of the parameters ; and ( 3 ) we use this information to construct a prior for the full parameter space , as in the above examples , while being mindful of data selection effects .",
    "how to go about steps ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) should be clear ; how to go about step ( 2 ) - the construction of two - dimensional priors , as well as one- and three - dimensional priors - we explain in  2.2.2 and  2.2.3 .",

    "this model is a combination of the two - parameter , ir and optical extinction curve model of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) , and the eight - parameter , uv extinction curve model of fitzpatrick & massa ( 1988 ) .",
    "we present the ir and optical extinction curve model in  3.1 ; we present the uv extinction curve model in  3.2 . in  3.3 , we modify these models to include the effect at far - uv ( fuv ) wavelengths of absorption by h i in galaxies .      using ubvrijhkl photometry of 29 reddened milky way ob stars ( clayton & mathis 1988 ; clayton & cardelli 1988 ) , and uv extinction curves that had been fitted to international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) spectra of 45 milky way ob stars ( fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ; see  3.2 ) , cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1988 , 1989 ) constructed an empirical , two - parameter , ir through fuv extinction curve model .",
    "the two parameters are @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "the former parameter normalizes the extinction curve at the v band ; the latter parameter , defined by @xmath164 @xmath165 is a measure of the amount of extinction at the b band relative to that at the v band .",
    "the standard diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) value of @xmath163 is 3.1 ; however , the value of @xmath163 is known to vary with the type of interstellar environment .",
    "for example , @xmath166 is typical of dense clouds .",
    "the cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) extinction curve is given by : @xmath167 where @xmath168 @xmath169 , and @xmath170 and @xmath171 are empirical expressions given by @xmath172 and @xmath173 where @xmath174 .",
    "cardelli , clayton , and mathis ( 1989 ) also determined expressions for @xmath170 and @xmath171 in the wavelength range @xmath175 ( 1000 @xmath176 @xmath177  ) ; however , the fitzpatrick & massa ( 1988 ) parameterization of the extinction curve , on which this portion of the cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) parameterization of the extinction curve is largely based , is a more general description of the extinction curve in the uv .",
    "consequently , we instead adopt the more general extinction curve model of fitzpatrick & massa ( 1988 ) at these uv wavelengths ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "the extinction curve at wavelengths @xmath178 @xmath176 is generally attributed to absorption and scattering by classical van de hulst grains ( van de hulst 1957 ) .",
    "these are relatively large grains , with sizes of 1000  2000  .",
    "they are thought to be fluffy , non - spherical composites containing carbon , silicates , oxides , and vacuum ( mathis 1996 , 1998 ; dwek 1998 ) .",
    "classical grain extinction saturates at a wavelength of @xmath179  .      in a series of four papers , massa & fitzpatrick ( 1986 ) and fitzpatrick & massa ( 1986 , 1988 , 1990 ) measured extinction curves for two samples of reddened milky way ob stars from iue spectra .",
    "their cluster sample consists of 35 stars from five clusters ; since these stars were drawn from similar interstellar environments , their extinction curves are relatively similar .",
    "their program sample consists of 45 stars from a wide variety of interstellar environments ; consequently , the extinction curves of this sample are more varied .",
    "fitzpatrick & massa ( 1988 , 1990 ) found that all 80 extinction curves are well fitted by the following three - component function : @xmath182 where @xmath183 and @xmath184 the first component , @xmath185 , is linear and spans the wavelength range of the data : @xmath180 @xmath176 @xmath177  .",
    "the second component , @xmath186 , is a functional form called the drude profile ; however , in this context , it is often called the 2175 @xmath176 bump , or the uv bump .",
    "the third component , @xmath187 , is an empirical expression called the fuv curvature component , or the fuv non - linear component .",
    "we depict all three of these components in figure 1 .    although the fitzpatrick & massa ( 1988 ) parameterization of the extinction curve is first and foremost an empirically - driven fitting function , it is not devoid of physical significance .",
    "for example , the drude profile is the functional form of the absorption cross section of a forced - damped harmonic oscillator ; it reduces to a lorentzian near resonance ( jackson 1962 ) .",
    "fitzpatrick & massa ( 1986 ) found that the drude profile better fits the data than does a pure lorentzian ; lorentzian profiles had been used previously ( savage 1975 ; seaton 1979 ) .",
    "the drude profile is a function of @xmath188 , the bump s center , and @xmath189 , the bump s width .",
    "the linear component of the extinction curve is generally attributed to a distribution of grain sizes ; the larger grains , with sizes perhaps as large as the classical grains , are responsible for extinction in the near - uv , and the smaller grains , with sizes perhaps as small as 100 @xmath176 or less , are responsible for extinction in the fuv .",
    "these grains have been interpreted either as the tail end of the classical grain population ( e.g. , mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 ) , or as a separate population altogether ( e.g. , hong & greenberg 1980 ) . the parameters @xmath190 and @xmath191 are correlated ( see figure 2 ,  4.2 ) ; however , this correlation is merely an artifact of the fitting procedure by which the values of these parameters are determined ( carnochan 1986 , see  4.2 ) .",
    "the values of these parameters are known to vary with the type of interstellar environment .",
    "for example , in the diffuse ism , the values of @xmath191 are in the range 0.6  1 , while in dense clouds , the values of @xmath191 extend to lower values : 0  1 ( e.g. , fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ) .",
    "this difference is generally attributed to the accretion of small grains onto larger grains , or to the coagulation of small grains into larger grains , both of which occur most readily in dense clouds ( scalo 1977 ; cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1988 , 1989 ; mathis & wiffen 1989 ) . in young star - forming regions , like the orion nebula , which are also dense clouds , @xmath192 ( e.g. , fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ) .",
    "this consistent , low value is generally attributed to stellar radiation forces , or to the evaporation of grains , both of which preferentially remove the smaller grains ( mccall 1981 ; cardelli & clayton 1988 ) .",
    "dense clouds also protect grains from supernovae shocks , which preferentially destroy the larger , classical grains or their mantles , and thus possibly increase the number of grains responsible for the linear component of the extinction curve ( seab & shull 1983 ; jenniskens & greenberg 1993 ; jones , tielens , & hollenbach 1996 ) .",
    "since extinction curves are normalized at the v band , the removal of classical grains alone guarantees higher values of @xmath191 ( e.g. , jenniskens & greenberg 1993 ) . indeed , in the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) , where old star - forming regions , like 30 doradus ( an extreme example ) , are more common than in the galaxy , the values of @xmath191 extend to higher values : 0.6  2 for the lmc and the smc wing , and 2  2.5 for the smc bar ( calzetti , kinney , & storchi - bergmann 1994 ; gordon & clayton 1998 ; misselt , clayton , & gordon 1999 ) . in starburst galaxies ,",
    "the values of @xmath191 are similarly high ( gordon , calzetti , & witt 1997 ) .",
    "there is less consensus about the type of grain that is responsible for the uv bump ; however , the fact that for fixed values of the ir and optical extinction curve parameter @xmath163 , and of the linear component parameters @xmath190 and @xmath191 , the strength of the uv bump can vary considerably , strongly suggests that the classical and linear component grains are not responsible for the uv bump ( e.g. , greenberg & chlewicki 1983 ) .",
    "the uv bump is sometimes attributed to small graphitic grains , having diameters of @xmath193 @xmath176 or less ( e.g. , hecht 1986 ) .",
    "one property of this model is that the bump s width , @xmath189 , can vary by a few tens of percent , while its center , @xmath188 , can vary by only a few percent ; this is what is observed ( e.g. , fitzpatrick & massa 1986 ) .",
    "another property of this model is that @xmath194 and @xmath189 are correlated , which is also observed ( see figure 4 , ",
    "4.2 ) ; however , this correlation appears to change with the type of interstellar environment ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "equations ( [ fm ] ) and ( [ drude ] ) show that the height , or strength , of the uv bump is proportional to @xmath195 .",
    "dense clouds and the diffuse ism tend to favor strong uv bumps ; however , star - forming regions , both young and old , tend to favor weak uv bumps .",
    "in fact , in the smc bar and starburst galaxies , no uv bump is typically observed .",
    "young star - forming regions tend to favor weak uv bumps probably because uv radiation destroys or alters the grains that are responsible for the uv bump ( jenniskens & greenberg 1993 ) ; old star - forming regions tend to favor weak uv bumps probably because uv radiation and/or supernova shocks destroy or alter the grains that are responsible for the uv bump ( gordon , calzetti , & witt 1997 ) .",
    "these effects can be seen in figure 5 ( see  4.2 ; see also clayton , gordon , & wolff 2000 ) , where @xmath194 is an approximate measure of the strength of the uv bump .",
    "even less is known about the type of grain that is responsible for the fuv non - linear component of the extinction curve . according to the model of hecht ( 1986 ) , the small graphitic grains that produce",
    "the uv bump should have a second plasmon resonance , resulting in a second and similar bump centered at a wavelength of @xmath196  .",
    "indeed , the shape of the fuv non - linear component resembles the red wing of a drude profile ( fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ) .",
    "furthermore , this model suggests that the strengths of these two bumps might be correlated ( e.g. , fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ) ; however , hydrogenation of these grains should largely decouple these resonances ( e.g. , hecht 1986 ) .",
    "fitzpatrick & massa ( 1988 ) and jenniskens & greenberg ( 1993 ) have shown that @xmath194 and @xmath189 are both weakly correlated with @xmath197 ; however , inclusion of the lmc and smc lines of sight suggests that these correlations also depend on the type of interstellar environment ( see figure 6 ,  4.2 ) . as in the case of the uv bump parameters",
    ", @xmath197 does not correlate with @xmath163 , @xmath190 , or @xmath191 ( jenniskens & greenberg 1993 ) .    like the ir and optical extinction curve model of cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ; equation [ ccm ] ) , the uv extinction curve model of fitzpatrick & massa ( 1988 ; equation [ fm ] )",
    "can be written as a function of @xmath198 , given the following rearrangement of the definition of @xmath163 ( equation [ rv ] ) : @xmath199 to smoothly link these two models ( see also fitzpatrick 1999 ) , we recommend the following weighted average of these models between the v band ( @xmath200  ) and @xmath201  : @xmath202    to summarize , to the limit of current observations , the ir through fuv extinction curve appears to be most generally modeled by eight parameters : @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath203 , @xmath197 , @xmath189 , and @xmath188 ; the uv bump is more naturally parameterized by @xmath203 ( bump height ) and @xmath189 ( bump width ) than by @xmath194 and @xmath189 , since the former pair is orthogonal ( jenniskens & greenberg 1993 ) . in  3.3 ,",
    "we modify equation ( [ ext ] ) to include the effect at fuv wavelengths of absorption by h i in galaxies ; this does not change the number of parameters . in  4 ,",
    "we show that the volume of the solution space of this additional , but necessary , eight - dimensional parameter space can be reduced significantly , _ a priori _ , with a prior ; without such a prior , equation ( [ ext ] ) has very little predictive power .",
    "the column density of h i in a galaxy along a line of sight is given by @xmath205 @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the gas to dust ratio of the galaxy along the line of sight , and @xmath208 is the standard value of this ratio for the milky way .",
    "the bound - free photo - absorption cross section of ground state hydrogen as a function of wavelength is given by @xmath209 total extinction occurs when @xmath210 , i.e. , when @xmath211 and @xmath212  .",
    "since this condition is always satisfied along lines of sight through galaxies , at least into the soft x rays , we replace equation ( [ ext ] ) with : @xmath213 consequently , equation ( [ ext2 ] ) describes how light is extinguished by dust and absorbed by h i along lines of sight through galaxies , in the rest frame , into the soft x rays .",
    "using fitted extinction curves from milky way and magellanic cloud lines of sight , and the statistical methodology that we presented in  2 , we now construct a prior that weights the eight - dimensional parameter space of the extinction curve model that we presented in  3 such that the volume of the solution space is reduced significantly , _ a priori_. we describe the data set in  4.1 .",
    "we model correlations between extinction curve parameters , and construct the prior , in  4.2 .      from the literature ,",

    "ideally , we would fit the models of correlations between extinction curve parameters that we present in  4.2 directly to the iue spectra and ir and optical photometry , instead of to the fitted values of the extinction curve parameters , which represent a compression of the information contained in the actual data .",
    "however , to do so would not be practicable . consequently , we instead adopt the best - fit values of the extinction curve parameters , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath194 , @xmath197 , @xmath189 , @xmath188 , and @xmath163 , and the fitted uncertainties in these parameters , when available , as the data set , at the expense of a minor loss of information .",

    ". there is some overlap between these samples : 3 of the fm cluster sample extinction curves and 24 of the fm program sample extinction curves are also in the the jg sample .",

    "of the 39 fm program sample lines of sight with high quality extinction curves , cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) found values of @xmath163 for 25 of these lines of sight from bvrijhkl photometry .",
    "of the 90 jg sample lines of sight with high quality extinction curves , aiello ( 1988 ) found values of @xmath163 for 49 of these lines of sight from bvk photometry .",
    "eight of these lines of sight are in common .",
    "this lowers the number of galactic values of @xmath163 from 74 to 66 .    from the fitted parameter values of the 21 high quality extinction curves that the fm and jg samples have in common , jenniskens & greenberg ( 1993 )",
    "measured systematic and random errors between the two group s fitted values for each extinction curve parameter ; we list these errors in table 2 .",
    "furthermore , these systematic and random errors are comparable in size . in the interest of creating a uniform data set , primarily to facilitate identification and modeling of the correlations between these parameters",
    ", we have shifted each group s fitted parameter values by one half of the systematic difference between the two group s results ; this brings both group s results into general agreement .",
    "we re - inject these systematic errors into the analysis in  4.2 .    secondly , unlike the fitted parameter values of the lmc and smc extinction curves , which we introduce below , uncertainties were not determined for each , or any , of the fitted parameter values of the galactic extinction curves .",
    "consequently , we adopt the above measured random errors as indicative of the uncertainties in the fitted parameter values of each of the galactic extinction curves in our sample . technically , since both groups fitted to the same iue spectra , these random errors are lower limits .",
    "however , massa & fitzpatrick ( 1986 ) measured nearly identical upper limits from variations in the fitted parameter values of extinction curves measured along different lines of sight in the same ob associations ; we list these errors in table 2 also .",
    "we adopt the lower limits because this forces us to conservatively overestimate the extrinsic scatters in the fits of  4.2 .    to our galactic sample",
    ", we have added the results of fits to 19 extinction curves , and 10 corresponding values of @xmath163 , from the lmc ( misselt , clayton & gordon 1999 ) , and the results of fits to 4 extinction curves , and 3 corresponding values of @xmath163 , from the smc ( gordon & clayton 1998 ) .",
    "this raises the number of extinction curves in our sample to 166 , and the number of corresponding values of @xmath163 to 79 .",
    "uncertainties have been determined for each of the fitted parameter values of the lmc and smc extinction curves .",
    "we now model known correlations between the pairs of extinction curve parameters @xmath190 and @xmath191 , and @xmath163 and @xmath191 .",
    "we also present possible correlations between the triplets of extinction curve parameters @xmath194 , @xmath189 , and @xmath191 ; @xmath197 , @xmath194 , and @xmath191 ; and @xmath197 , @xmath189 , and @xmath191 ; however , we consider these three - parameter correlations to be too speculative to incorporate into our extinction curve prior .",
    "we also constrain the values of the extinction curve parameters @xmath189 and @xmath188 , which do not vary significantly across all 166 of the lines of sight in our data set (  4.1 ) .",
    "finally , we use this information to construct the extinction curve prior .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the extinction curve parameter @xmath191 , upon which all of the above correlations depend . in  3.2 , we pointed out that different values of @xmath191 are measured from different interstellar environments : low values of @xmath191 are measured from young star - forming regions , low to moderate values of @xmath191 are measured from dense clouds , moderate values of @xmath191 are measured from the diffuse ism , and moderate to high values of @xmath191 are measured from old star - forming regions .",
    "this is not to say that @xmath191 is a good measure of an interstellar environment s type : e.g. , 30 doradus is roughly ten times as active of a star - forming region as any region in the smc ( caplan et al .",
    "1996 ) , yet significantly higher values of @xmath191 are measured from the smc bar than from 30 doradus ; this is probably due to the smc having lower density clouds , which are less able to protect the classical grains from uv radiation and supernovae shocks , than does the lmc ( misselt , clayton , & gordon 1999 ) .",
    "however , @xmath191 might be a reasonable , approximate measure of the net ability of an interstellar environment to affect extinguishing grains .",
    "hence , the above correlations might be viewed as how the values of other extinction curve parameters , or the correlations between other extinction curve parameters , vary as a function of a single - parameter measure of net environmental conditions .    to apply the statistical methodology that we presented in  2.2 , ( 1 ) the models that we adopt to describe the above correlations must be slowly varying , i.e. , the curve @xmath88 from  2.2.2 and  2.2.3 must be varying from linearity only on scales that are larger than the scales given by the scatter of the data that we presented in  4.1 about this curve ; and ( 2 ) the density of these data along this curve also must be slowly varying ; i.e.",
    ", the intrinsic density along this curve , @xmath124 , and the selection function , @xmath89 , must be varying from constancy only on scales that are larger than the scales given by this scatter of the data (  2.2.2 ) .",
    "as we adopt only constant , linear , and slowly - varying quadratic models below , the first condition is met . as for the second condition ,",
    "the density of the data varies most obviously with the value of @xmath191 .",
    "this is probably due to the selection function ; e.g. , diffuse ism lines of sight , and consequently , values of @xmath214 , have been selected more often than lines of sight through any other type of interstellar environment , or value of @xmath191 .",
    "these density variations , however , also occur on scales that are larger than the scales given by the scatter of the data ; consequently , the second condition also appears to be met .",
    "hence , we appear to be within the realm of the formalism that we presented in  2.2 , with but one caveat .",
    "the intrinsic scatters of some of the extinction parameters , namely @xmath190 and @xmath191 , are probably somewhat correlated ( fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ) .",
    "this causes us to somewhat underestimate the extrinsic scatters of these correlations below , but not significantly .",
    "we begin with the two - parameter correlations : @xmath190 and @xmath191 ( figure 2 ) , and @xmath163 and @xmath191 ( figure 3 ) . in both cases , the parameters are well correlated ; however , both of these correlations are more mathematical than physical in nature . in the case of the former correlation , the linear component of equation ( [ fm ] )",
    "is observed to pivot about a point at a wavelength of @xmath215 @xmath176 as the slope , @xmath191 , of this component changes from one line of sight to another .",
    "if @xmath190 were measured at this wavelength , instead of at @xmath216 , this correlation would disappear ; consequently , this correlation is merely an artifact of the fitting procedure by which the values of these parameters were determined ( carnochan 1986 ) , and not due to any intrinsic physical property .",
    "however , the small size of the extrinsic scatter that we measure below for this correlation testifies to the constancy of the extinction curve at this pivot point .",
    "this is a physical property , since the wavelength of this pivot point differs from the v - band wavelength , @xmath217  , at which the extinction curve is normalized .    to the degree",
    "that the ir and optical extinction curve is really a one - parameter function of @xmath163 , and to the degree that the linear component of the uv extinction curve is really a one - parameter function of @xmath191 ( since @xmath190 and @xmath191 are strongly correlated ) , @xmath163 and @xmath191 must be correlated if the extinction curve is to be continuous and differentiable between optical and uv wavelengths ; consequently , this relation is also mathematical in nature .",
    "however , physical information can be gleamed from the value of @xmath163 , which by equation ( [ rv2 ] ) is a measure of the relative numbers and/or absorptivities of grains extinguishing in the @xmath218 band to grains extinguishing in the @xmath219 band .",
    "how this value changes as the value of @xmath191 is changed provides physical information , perhaps as a function of environmental conditions , as we have discussed above .",
    "we now model these two correlations , and construct the prior , as described in  2.2.2 and  2.2.3 .",
    "we do not include the orion nebula lines of sight in either of these fits , because nebular background contamination artificially lowers the measured values of @xmath190 along these lines of sight ( panek 1983 ) , and similarly may affect the measured values of @xmath191 ( fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ) ; this effect has not been corrected for in these data ( fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ) .    given how the values of @xmath190 and @xmath191 were determined , we model the first of these correlations with a function that is linear in @xmath191 : @xmath220 where @xmath221 is the sample s median value of @xmath191 . the 1-@xmath46 uncertainty in @xmath190 as a function of @xmath191 is approximately given by @xmath222^{1/2 } , \\label{c1sig}\\ ] ] where @xmath223 and @xmath224 are the fitted 1-@xmath46 uncertainties in the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath225 , and @xmath226 and @xmath227 are the fitted 1-@xmath46 extrinsic scatters in the @xmath190 and @xmath191 dimensions (  2.2.3 ) .",

    "a strong correlation exists between @xmath194 and @xmath189 for galactic lines of sight ( @xmath248 ) ( fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ; jenniskens & greenberg 1993 ) ; however , inclusion of the orion nebula - like lines of sight ( @xmath249 ) , and the lmc and smc wing lines of sight ( @xmath250 ) ruins this previously - determined correlation ; the smc bar lines of sight ( @xmath251 ) are not constraining since @xmath189 can not be well determined when @xmath252 .",
    "these lines of sight request a shallower relation .",
    "physically , this probably corresponds to the destruction or alteration of the uv bump grains by uv radiation and/or supernovae shocks (  3.2 , figure 5 ; see also clayton , gordon , & wolff 2000 ) .",
    "weak correlations exist between @xmath197 and @xmath194 , and @xmath197 and @xmath189 for galactic lines of sight ( fitzpatrick & massa 1988 ; jenniskens & greenberg 1993 ) ; indeed , weak positive correlations can be seen in figure 6 , if only the galactic lines of sight are considered . however , inclusion of the lmc and smc lines of sight also ruins these previously - determined correlations .",
    "the destruction or alteration of uv bump grains by the environment probably accounts for the shift to lower values of @xmath194 in the top panel of figure 6 .",
    "hydrogenation might account for the greater scatter in the bottom panel of figure 6 (  3.2 ) .    in any case , we do not attempt to model and constrain the possible correlations in figures 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "first of all , in distant galaxies , these grain species might occur in different relative abundances , perhaps due to different relative metallicities .",
    "secondly , even if this is not the case , if the extinction is due primarily to dust that is local to the burst , the relative abundances of these grain species may be altered by the burst itself , as well as by the afterglow ( lamb & reichart 2000b ) .",
    "consequently , no constraint can be placed between the extinction curve parameters @xmath191 , @xmath203 , and @xmath197 .",
    "the values of @xmath189 and @xmath188 are approximately constant across all 166 lines of sight .",
    "we find their values to be @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "since the width of the uv bump is approximately equal to the widths of the photometric bands ( @xmath255 ) , and since the uncertainty in the center of the uv bump is significantly smaller than the widths of the photometric bands ( @xmath256 ) , when fitting to afterglow photometry , precise values of these parameters can not be extractable from the data ; i.e. , the fitted solutions should largely resemble the adopted prior , particularly in the case of the bump center parameter , @xmath188 .",
    "we now construct from these results an extinction curve prior , in accordance with the examples of  2.2.1 . for the extinction curve parameters @xmath163 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath189 , and @xmath188 ,",
    "we recommend that the following prior be used : @xmath257g[c_1,c_1(c_2),3\\sigma_{c_1}(c_2)]\\\\ \\times g(\\gamma,0.958,0.264)g(x_0,4.593,0.060).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we have conservatively tripled the 1-@xmath46 uncertainties of the component priors , simply because these priors are determined solely from information that is local to our galaxy . for the extinction curve parameters @xmath162 , @xmath203 , and @xmath197 , we conservatively recommend that a flat prior be used . altogether ,",
    "this prior weights the eight - dimensional parameter space of the extinction curve model that we presented in  3 such that the volume of the solution space is reduced significantly , _ a priori_.    finally , we comment on the possibility of an evolving extinction curve . as mentioned above ,",
    "if an afterglow is extinguished by dust that is local to a burst , energetic photons , both from the burst and from the afterglow , may alter the extinction curve with time ( lamb & reichart 2000b ) .",
    "however , since all afterglows observed to date have faded more rapidly than @xmath258 at optical through x - ray wavelengths , the majority of these energetic photons are probably emitted during the first few seconds or minutes of the afterglow , if not during the burst itself .",
    "hence , any dust destruction or alteration that may occur , should occur on such timescales . by restricting oneself to photometry taken hours or longer after a burst , one should be able to safely ignore the possibility of an evolving extinction curve .",
    "at redshifts of @xmath259 , the ly@xmath0 forest will absorb light at optical wavelengths , and consequently can not be ignored ( fruchter 1999a ; lamb & reichart 2000a ) .",
    "we present a two - parameter model that describes the effects of the ly@xmath0 forest on the spectral flux distributions of afterglows ( and on the spectral flux distributions of all extragalactic point sources for that matter ) . using ly@xmath0 forest flux deficit measurements from quasar absorption line systems ,",
    "we construct a prior that weights this two - dimensional space such that the volume of the solution space is reduced significantly .    in the study of quasar absorption line systems , the quantity called flux deficit , denoted @xmath260 , is defined by @xmath261 where this quantity is averaged over the wavelength range between the emission lines ly@xmath0 and ly@xmath262 @xmath263 o vi that is not affected by emission line wings , and only if the continuum can be reliably extrapolated from the unabsorbed spectrum at longer wavelengths ( oke & korycansky 1982 ) . zuo & phinney ( 1993 ) , zuo ( 1993 ) , and lu & zuo ( 1994 ) model this quantity by @xmath264,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are parameters whose values are determined by fitting to flux deficit measurements , @xmath265 is the redshift corresponding to the central wavelength of the range over which the quantity @xmath260 is averaged , and @xmath266 is the median value of @xmath265 for the sample to which one is fitting . the 1-@xmath46 uncertainty in @xmath260 as a function of @xmath265 is approximately given by @xmath267^{1/2 } , \\label{dasig}\\ ] ] where @xmath268 and @xmath223 are the fitted 1-@xmath46 uncertainties in the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and @xmath269 and @xmath270 are the fitted 1-@xmath46 extrinsic scatters in the @xmath260 and @xmath265 dimensions (  2.2.3 ) .    assuming a flat prior , and adopting sample 4 of zuo & lu ( 1993 ) , which is a combination of sample 2 of zuo & lu ( 1993 ) ( see zuo & lu 1993 for details ) and the high redshift ( @xmath271 ) sample of schneider , schmidt , & gunn ( 1989a , b , 1991 ) , we find : @xmath272 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath277 , and @xmath278 .",
    "we plot sample 4 of zuo and lu ( 1993 ) and , using equation ( [ dasig ] ) and these fitted values , approximate 1- , 2- , and 3-@xmath46 confidence regions in figure 7 .",
    "the extent of the scatter about the best fit in figure 7 is largely a reflection of the extent of the wavelength range over which these values of @xmath260 were averaged .",
    "this wavelength range corresponds to @xmath279 , which is typical of the photometric bands . in other words ,",
    "the scatter in figure 7 , very conveniently , is typical of what one would find if ly@xmath0 forest flux deficits were measured from afterglows photometrically .",
    "consequently , the ly@xmath0 forest flux deficit prior _ for photometric , as opposed to spectroscopic , data _ is given by (  2.2.1 ) @xmath280.\\ ] ]",
    "we now demonstrate the breath of the models of  3 and  5 . using these models , we plot in figure 8 example spectral flux distributions that have been extinguished by dust in a host galaxy , absorbed by h i in the host galaxy , redshifted , and absorbed by the ly@xmath0 forest , for a wide variety of plausible extinction curves and redshifts . we have adopted an intrinsic spectrum of @xmath281 , and we allow the values of @xmath162 , @xmath191 , @xmath203 , @xmath197 , and @xmath265 to vary over observed / reasonable ranges .",
    "the values of @xmath163 , @xmath190 , @xmath189 , @xmath188 , and @xmath260 , we take from the best fits of  4.2 and  5 .",
    "finally , we convolve each extinguished , absorbed , and redshifted spectrum with a logarithmically flat smearing function of width @xmath282 , converting each spectrum to a spectral flux distribution ; i.e. , we model how these spectra would be sampled photometrically , as opposed to spectroscopically (  5 ) .",
    "clearly , a single intrinsic spectrum can manifest itself in a multitude of ways , and exhibit a variety of broad spectral features , including a shoulder in the infrared , the uv bump , the ly@xmath0 forest , and the lyman limit .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a very general , bayesian inference formalism with which afterglow models can be tested , and with which the parameter values of acceptable models can be constrained .",
    "furthermore , we have developed and presented a formalism for the construction of bayesian prior probability distributions from multi - dimensional data sets , which we have drawn on extensively .",
    "we have presented models that describe how extinction by dust , both in host galaxies and in our galaxy , and absorption by the ly@xmath0 forest and by h i in host galaxies , change the intrinsic spectra of afterglows .",
    "then , applying the above formalism , we constructed a prior that weights the additional , but necessary , parameter space of these models such that the volume of the solution space is reduced significantly , _ a priori_. these models and priors will lead to the more realistic modeling of afterglows , particularly at ir through uv wavelengths , in future papers .",
    "finally , we emphasize that the phenomena for which we have presented models and priors in this paper  extinction by dust and absorption by the ly@xmath0 forest ",
    "affect identically the light from all other extragalactic point sources .",
    "consequently , the work presented in this paper is as applicable to high - redshift type ia supernovae and quasars , for example , as it is to the afterglows of bursts .",
    "since the effects of extinction and absorption are most dramatic at uv wavelengths in the source frame , these models and priors will be particularly useful for the modeling of optical photometry of high - redshift point sources .",
