    "colored scalars are frequent harbingers of new physics . for example , they are inherent to any theory of matter unification  @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , colored scalars that can couple directly to matter fields are of particular interest .",
    "this feature makes them very appealing candidates for collider physics and precision flavor studies .",
    "for example , some have been suggested as possible explanations of the enhanced forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath6 production as measured at the tevatron  @xcite or the @xmath7 anomaly  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been pointed out that some could also contribute significantly to the unexpectedly large cp asymmetry in the decays @xmath8  @xcite . moreover , in a framework of simple one - particle extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , these states can establish a unique link between collider and planck scale physics via proton decay  @xcite .",
    "they might even help induce tiny neutrino masses through loop effects  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that light colored scalars help improve unification of gauge couplings in the grand unified theory ( gut ) setting  @xcite .",
    "it could thus be possible to establish a firm connection between the colored scalar mass scale and observable proton decay signatures in the minimal matter unification scenarios .",
    "moreover , the colored states often reside in the same representation of the gut group as the fields responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "this could allow one to infer the strength of yukawa couplings of colored states to matter .",
    "these , on the other hand , are subject to nontrivial constraints originating from low - energy flavor phenomenology and the requirement of viable fermion masses .",
    "what one can end up with is a highly predictive class of simple models that connect matter stability to low - energy phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "a generic feature of massive scalars in extensions of the sm is that they couple to the sm higgs boson . above the ewsb scale",
    ", one can write marginal ",
    "the so - called  higgs portal \"  @xcite  operators of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the sm higgs doublet , @xmath11 is the new scalar weak ( and color ) multiplet and all possible color and weak contractions are assumed .",
    "after ewsb this will induce corrections to the masses of weak @xmath11 components ( @xmath12 ) and couplings of the form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the physical higgs boson . at the one - loop level ,",
    "the presence of such interactions can affect higgs production and decays as measured at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "in fact preliminary data on the higgs - like resonance with a mass of @xmath15gev show an excess of events in the loop - induced @xmath0 decay channel with respect to the sm prediction at the @xmath16 level , while other , tree - level dominated higgs decays to vector bosons show good consistency with the sm expectations  @xcite .",
    "if it were to persist at larger significance , such a deviation would point towards the existence of new degrees of freedom at the ew scale that couple to the higgs boson .",
    "motivated by these observations , in the present study , we focus on the contributions of colored scalars to loop - induced production and decay channels of the higgs boson through interactions of the form @xmath9 ( a similar analysis based on earlier experimental results can be found in  @xcite ) . in particular , we study fields with direct couplings to the sm matter fields that can thus play an interesting role in other collider and flavor observables .",
    "we single out two fields which accommodate the observed @xmath0 enhancement while remaining in good agreement with the other measured decay channels .",
    "interestingly enough , these fields turn out to be sextets and octets of color .",
    "this precludes them from having leptoquark - like couplings to the ordinary matter .",
    "we then proceed to show how and where these particular states appear in simple scenarios of matter unification .",
    "we revisit gauge coupling unification in two full - fledged models based on the @xmath5 gauge group  @xcite to demonstrate the connection between the lightness of these states and observable proton decay signatures .",
    "one of the models can also address the @xmath7 anomaly , albeit through the presence of an additional light colored scalar .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ htogammagamma ]",
    "we discuss a possible explanation of the @xmath0 excess with colored scalar fields .",
    "we analyze the impact of all the relevant experimental inputs and specify the numerical procedure used to generate our results .",
    "we also provide predictions for @xmath4 and di - higgs production using the best - case scenarios and associated parameters .",
    "the fields that can help accommodate the @xmath0 excess are shown to appear naturally in matter unification scenarios in section  [ color_scalars ] .",
    "there we also correlate the lightness of these states with observable proton decay signatures .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we study the influence of colored scalar fields coupling to the sm higgs doublet through @xmath9 interactions on higgs production and decay signatures at the lhc .",
    "if sufficiently light , such states can significantly modify the loop - induced @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath0 processes , while leaving other , tree - level dominated higgs production and decay channels sm - like .    after specifying the color and ew representations , each scenario ( @xmath11 )",
    "can be parametrized in terms of the relevant higgs couplings and masses of the weak components @xmath12 of the multiplet .",
    "different possible weak contractions of the @xmath20 terms will in general induce different relative contributions to these couplings and masses . however , severe experimental constraints coming mainly from the @xmath21 parameter require an approximate custodial symmetry to be active in the ew symmetric scalar potential ( c.f .",

    "the relevant observables , which can be significantly affected by colored scalar contributions , are the recently measured lhc higgs production rates in the @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 channels  @xcite listed in table  [ tab:2 ] . in our fit",

    "another possibility is to allow @xmath82 to be negative and large , so that contribution of the scalar in the loop is twice the contribution of the top quark but with opposite sign . in this case @xmath17",

    "horizontal dashed line represents a limit due to the constraint imposed by experimental limit on partial proton decay lifetime through @xmath178.,width=264 ]    the relevant coupling of the octet to the - would - be higgs field @xmath14 originates from the following set of @xmath5 contractions : @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "the couplings of the neutral and charged component of the octet @xmath209 to the - would - be sm higgs , under the assumption that the sm doublet primarily originates from @xmath150-dimensional representation , are @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively .",
    "any mixing between the doublets in @xmath150- and @xmath152-dimensional representation can be easily accounted for . in any case , we need to go to the limit @xmath212 . to reproduce the setup used in section  [ htogammagamma ] where",
    "the @xmath0 excess is accounted for via custodial symmetric color octet loops one needs to assume that @xmath213 is much smaller than @xmath214 .",
    "the color sextet @xmath215 resides in @xmath216- and @xmath217-dimensional representations of @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that it can provide for gauge coupling unification within an @xmath5 framework  @xcite .",
    "it is , however , difficult to connect its lightness to proton decay or correlate its yukawa couplings with the origin of masses for matter fields without additional assumptions in that particular setup .",
    "this seems , instead , to require an @xmath218 embedding scheme .",
    "namely , the color sextet is part of @xmath219- and @xmath220-dimensional representations of @xmath218 .",
    "both representations are frequently used in model building with the former one being crucial in explaining observed fermion masses .",
    "for example , colored scalars , which are part of @xmath219-dimensional representation of @xmath218 and are light enough to be accessible at the lhc , have recently been proposed in refs .",
    "in fact , there already exists a viable setup with an intermediate - scale sextet  @xcite .",
    "it might thus be feasible to have very light @xmath215 scalar that would originate from an @xmath218 model .",
    "we leave it to future studies .",
    "we have considered the impact of light colored scalars that can couple directly to matter fields on the recently observed @xmath0 excess . we find two viable scenarios where two states@xmath1 and @xmath2can individually influence the excess in a constructive way and remain in excellent agreement with all available data .",
    "the colored states in question should have a substantial coupling to the sm higgs of order one and a mass of order @xmath3gev ( or below ) in order to explain the data .",
    "in particular , perturbativity arguments require that the sextet and octet masses should be below @xmath87gev and @xmath88gev , respectively .",
    "the best fit values for the colored scalar masses and couplings to the higgs are used to generate predictions for @xmath4 and di - higgs production .",
    "we find moderate suppression of the partial decay width @xmath4 with regard to the sm value .",
    "the di - higgs production , on the other hand , is enhanced by at least a factor of a hundred with respect to the sm prediction at both the 8  tev and 14  tev lhc .",
    "we subsequently study extensions of the sm where these states naturally appear with primary focus on matter unification models based on @xmath5 gauge group .",
    "it is shown that two simple models correlate light color octet mass with observable proton decay .",
    "for the color octet mass of @xmath88gev the predicted partial proton decay lifetime through @xmath159 channel is a factor of 5 ( 25 ) above the current limit for the model with extra fermions ( scalars ) in @xmath154-dimensional ( @xmath201-dimensional ) representation . in the model with extra fermions",
    "it is also possible to accommodate the @xmath7 anomaly , albeit through a presence of an additional light colored scalar . in conclusion",
    ", the presented setup relates high scale matter unification and matter stability to higgs physics via the effects of light colored scalar states .",
