    "there has been a considerable attention in general relativity in more than four spacetime dimensions in recent years .",
    "there are several reasons why it should be interesting to study this extension of einstein s theory , and in particular its black hole solutions ( for a recent review on higher dimensional black holes see @xcite ) .",
    "the first reason originates from developments in string theory , which is believed to be the most promising approach to quantum theory of gravity in higher dimensions .",
    "in fact , the first successful statistical counting of black hole entropy in string theory was performed for a five - dimensional black hole @xcite .",
    "this example provides the best laboratory for the microscopic string theory of black holes .",
    "second , the ads / cft correspondence relates the properties of an @xmath0-dimensional black hole with those of a quantum field theory in @xmath4-dimensions @xcite .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , the rotating black holes in ads space are dual to certain cfts in a rotating space @xcite , while charged ones are dual to cfts with chemical potential @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as mathematical objects , black hole spacetimes are among the most important lorentzian ricci - flat manifolds in any dimension .",
    "one striking feature of the einstein equations in more than four dimensions is that many uniqueness properties holding in four dimensions are lost .",
    "for instance , four - dimensional black holes are known to possess a number of remarkable features , such as uniqueness , spherical topology , dynamical stability , and the laws of black hole mechanics .",
    "one would like to know which of these are peculiar to four - dimensions , and which hold more generally .",
    "at least , this study will lead to a deeper understanding of classical black holes and of what spacetime can do at its most extreme .",
    "besides , it was confirmed by recent investigations that the gravity in higher dimensions exhibits much richer dynamics than in four dimensions . for example , the discovery of dynamical instabilities of extended black hole horizons @xcite , and the discovery of black ring solutions with horizons of non - spherical topology and not fully characterized by their conserved charges @xcite . while the nonrotating black hole solution to the higher - dimensional einstein - maxwell gravity was found several decades ago @xcite ,",
    "the counterpart of the kerr - newman solution in higher dimensions , that is the charged generalization of the myers - perry solution @xcite in higher dimensional einstein - maxwell theory , still remains to be found analytically .",
    "the most general higher dimensional uncharged rotating black holes in anti - de sitter space with all rotation parameters have been recently found @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , rotating black holes for the maxwell field minimally coupled to einstein gravity in higher dimensions , do not exist in a closed form and one has to rely on perturbative or numerical methods to construct them in the background of asymptotically flat @xcite and ads @xcite spacetime .",
    "there has also been recent interest in constructing the analogous charged rotating solutions in the framework of gauged supergravity in various dimensions @xcite .",
    "there has been a renewed interest in studying scalar coupled solutions of general relativity ever since new black hole solutions have been found in the context of string theory .",
    "the low energy effective action of string theory contains two massless scalars namely dilaton and axion .",
    "the dilaton field couples in a nontrivial way to other fields such as gauge fields and results into interesting solutions for the background spacetime @xcite .",
    "these solutions @xcite , however , are all asymptotically flat . in the presence of one or two liouville - type dilaton potentials , black hole spacetimes which are neither asymptotically flat nor ( anti)-de sitter [ ( a)ds ] have been explored by many authors ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "recently , by using the combination of three liouville type dilaton potentials , static charged dilaton black hole solutions in four @xcite and higher dimensions @xcite have been found in the background of ( a)ds spacetime .",
    "such potential may arise from the compactification of a higher dimensional supergravity model @xcite which originates from the low energy limit of a background string theory .    in the backdrop of the scenarios described so far it is therefore worthwhile to study higher dimensional rotating black holes in a spacetime with nonzero cosmological constant in the presence of dilaton - electromagnetic coupling .",
    "for some limited values of the dilaton coupling constant , @xmath3 , exact rotating black hole solutions have been obtained in @xcite . for general dilaton coupling constant ,",
    "the properties of charged rotating dilaton black holes in four @xcite and five @xcite dimensions have been studied in the small angular momentum limit .",
    "the generalization of these slowly rotating solutions in all higher dimensions with a single rotation parameter have also been done @xcite .",
    "however , in more than three spatial dimensions , black holes can rotate in different orthogonal planes , so the general solution has several angular momentum parameters . indeed",
    ", an @xmath0-dimensional black hole can have @xmath1 $ ] independent rotation parameters , associated with @xmath2 orthogonal planes of rotation where @xmath5 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath6 . in this paper",
    "we would like to extend our former works @xcite to the higher dimensional charged rotating dilaton black holes with all rotation parameters .",
    "we then determine the angular momentum and the gyromagnetic ratio of such a black hole for the arbitrary values of the dilaton coupling constant .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the action and the field equations . in section",
    "[ flat ] , we present the metric of the higher dimensional charged slowly rotating dilaton black hole in asymptotically flat spacetime with all rotation parameters .",
    "we also compute the angular momentum and the gyromagnetic ratio of the solution . in section [ ads ] , we extend our solution to asymptotically ( a)ds spacetimes .",
    "the last section is devoted to summary and conclusions .",
    "our starting point is the @xmath0-dimensional theory in which gravity is coupled to dilaton and maxwell field with an action @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the scalar curvature , @xmath9 is the dilaton field , @xmath10 is the electromagnetic field tensor , and @xmath11 is the electromagnetic potential .",
    "@xmath12 is an arbitrary constant governing the strength of the coupling between the dilaton and the maxwell field and @xmath13 is the potential for @xmath9 .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ act ] ) is the gibbons - hawking surface term .",
    "it is required for the variational principle to be well - defined .",
    "the factor @xmath14 represents the trace of the extrinsic curvature for the boundary @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the induced metric on the boundary . while @xmath17 corresponds to the usual einstein - maxwell - scalar theory",
    ", @xmath18 indicates the dilaton - electromagnetic coupling that appears in the low energy string action in einstein s frame .",
    "varying the action ( [ act ] ) with respect to the gravitational field @xmath19 , the dilaton field @xmath20 and the gauge field @xmath11 , we obtain the field equations @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 we would like to find the rotating solutions of the above field equations with all rotation parameters in all higher dimensions in the limit of slow rotation .",
    "the rotation group in @xmath0-dimensions is @xmath24 and therefore the number of independent rotation parameters for a localized object is equal to the number of casimir operators , which is @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath5 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath6 . for small rotation parameters",
    ", we can solve eqs .",
    "( [ fe1])-([fe3 ] ) to first order in the angular momentum parameters @xmath25 .",
    "inspection of the myers - perry solution @xcite shows that the terms in the metric that change to the first order of the rotational parameters @xmath26 s are @xmath27 s @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , the dilaton field does not change to @xmath29 and @xmath30 s are the components of the vector potential that change .",
    "therefore , inspired by the myers - perry metric @xcite , for infinitesimal angular momentum , we assume the metric being of the following form @xmath31 where for even @xmath0 we have @xmath32 and @xmath33 , whereas for odd n , @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the @xmath36 ( and @xmath37 , for even dimensional cases ) coordinates are not independent but have to obey the constraint @xmath38 the functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 should be determined . for small @xmath26 @xmath28 , we can expect to have solutions with @xmath39 and @xmath40 still functions of @xmath43 alone .",
    "the @xmath44 component of the maxwell equations can be integrated immediately to give @xmath45 where @xmath46 , an integration constant , is the electric charge of the black hole . in general , in the presence of rotation , we have @xmath47 .",
    "in addition we can write @xmath48",
    "we begin by looking for the asymptotically flat solutions , therefore we set @xmath49 in the field equations . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we found a class of asymptotically flat slowly rotating charged dilaton black hole solution in higher dimensions with single rotation parameter .",

    "next , we calculate the angular momentum and the gyromagnetic ratio of these rotating dilaton black holes which appear in the limit of slow rotation parameters . the angular momentum of the dilaton black hole can be calculated through the use of the quasi - local formalism of the brown and york @xcite . according to the quasilocal formalism",
    ", the quantities can be constructed from the information that exists on the boundary of a gravitating system alone .",
    "such quasilocal quantities will represent information about the spacetime contained within the system boundary , just like the gauss s law . in our case",
    "the finite stress - energy tensor can be written as @xmath75 which is obtained by variation of the action ( [ act ] ) with respect to the boundary metric @xmath76 . to compute the angular momentum of the spacetime",
