    "percolation @xcite is a mathematical description of a geometrical phase transition .",
    "this allows for purely theoretical studies of all phenomena occurring near the critical point with computer experiments solely or , sometimes , even analytically @xcite . the mixture of occupied and empty sites of given lattice may exhibit some features of real physical systems . among typical applications of the percolation theory",
    "one may find material science @xcite , immunology @xcite or forest fires problems @xcite and studies of liquids moving in porous media @xcite , etc . @xcite .    generally speaking ,",
    "the percolation theory deals with statistical properties of the clusters of occupied nodes ( site percolation ) or occupied edges ( bond percolation ) for a given graph , network or regular lattice . in the site percolation problem ,",
    "the cluster is defined as a group of the occupied lattice vertexes which are direct or indirect neighbours .",
    "when each site is occupied with some probability @xmath1 there is a critical probability of sites occupation @xmath2 above which a cluster spanning through the whole system appears for the first time @xcite . this special probability is called percolation threshold @xmath2 and it separates two phases ( in the language of material science a conductor and an isolator ) .",
    "the value of percolation threshold @xmath2 depends on kind of percolation ( site / bond ) , lattice / graph / network topology and assumed sites neighbourhoods . in the simplest case",
    "only the nearest neighbours constitute the neighbourhoods ( von neumann s neighbourhood ) or the nearest neighbours and next - nearest neighbours are considered ( moore s neighbourhood ) .    in the vicinity of the phase transition",
    "the quantity @xmath3 describing the system follows a scaling relation @xmath4 where @xmath5 describes the linear size of the system , @xmath6 is a scaling function and @xmath7 is dimensionless scaling parameter @xcite . for physical systems @xmath7 usually plays the role of reduced temperature @xmath8 , where @xmath9 stands for critical temperature .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath11 parameters are universal exponents which  in the first approximation  do not depend on system details ( kind of order / disorder phenomenon , lattice shape , site or bond percolation , etc . ) but only on the system dimensionality @xcite .",
    "however , for @xmath10 and @xmath11 calculations the precise value of @xmath9 is required . for the geometrical model of the phase transition percolation threshold @xmath2 plays the role of critical temperature .    in this communication",
    "we evaluate with computer simulations @xcite the random - site simple cubic percolation thresholds for neighbourhoods including the nearest - neighbours ( nn ) , the second - nearest neighbours ( 2nn ) and the third - nearest neighbours ( 3nn ) . our estimations base on finite size scaling analysis @xcite of the percolation probability vs. site occupation probability plots . the hoshen ",
    "kopelman algorithm @xcite has been applied for cluster labelling .",
    "the calculated thresholds @xmath2 are 0.1372(1 ) , 0.1420(1 ) , 0.0976(1 ) , 0.1991(1 ) , 0.1036(1 ) , 0.2455(1 ) for ( nn + 2nn ) , ( nn + 3nn ) , ( nn + 2nn + 3nn ) , 2nn , ( 2nn + 3nn ) , 3nn neighbourhoods , respectively .",
    "in contrast to the results obtained for a square lattice @xcite the calculated percolation thresholds decrease monotonically with the site coordination number @xmath0 , at least for our inspected neighbourhoods .",
    "( nn )   ( 2nn )   ( 3nn )",
    "we use hoshen  kopelman algorithm @xcite for occupied sites labelling . in the hoshen ",
    "kopelman scheme each site has one label : all sites in a given cluster have the same labels and different clusters have assigned different labels .",
    "examples of percolation probability @xmath12 vs. sites occupation probability @xmath1 for various neighbourhoods and for various lattice linear sizes @xmath5 are presented in fig .",
    "[ p - vs - p ] .",
    "we use finite - size scaling analysis to determine @xmath2 numerically . as for finite systems",
    "the phase transition is never sharp we observe it when for increasing lattice sizes @xmath5 the @xmath13 curves become more and more steep and intersect at a common point corresponding also to the case of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the common cross - point predicts percolation threshold @xmath2 .",
    "such strategy was successfully applied for many system description where phase transition may be observed including percolation @xcite , ising model @xcite , majority - vote models @xcite or opinion dynamics @xcite .",
    "+     +        basing on @xmath13 dependence for various @xmath5 we look for an interval of the length @xmath15 where curves for @xmath16 and 100 cross each other .",
    "the results have been averaged over @xmath17 lattice realisations .",
    "for example for 2nn case this interval is ( 0.1990,0.1992 ) and the centre of this bracket plays the role of percolation threshold .",
    "basing on a uncertainty type b evaluation procedure @xcite we estimate the uncertainty @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath13 dependencies for @xmath19 , 63 and 100 are presented in fig .",

    "the evaluated percolation thresholds @xmath2 for various neighbourhoods are collected in tab .",
    "[ tab - pc ] . to check the accuracy of our estimations we evaluated the percolation threshold for compact neighbourhoods as well .",
