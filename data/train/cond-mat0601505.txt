    "phosphorous - doped si is the back - bone of micro - electronic technology . recently ,",
    "p - si system has generated renewed interest due to its potential application in quantum computers  @xcite and growth of molecular wires on si surfaces  @xcite .",
    "it is also of fundamental interest to compare the behavior of p - p dimers with si - si and al - al dimers on the si surfaces , a lot having been understood about the last system  @xcite .",
    "phosphine gas ( ph@xmath2 ) is used as the source of p in most applications .",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite concluded from their experiments that around 675@xmath3 c , all hydrogen atoms from ph@xmath2 are desorbed and the surface is a monolayer ( ml ) p covered si(001 ) with the formation of p - p dimers .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite did a scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) study of phosphorous - terminated si(001 ) surface close to a monolayer p coverage .",
    "they find mostly p - p dimers , along with some si - p dimers on the surface .",
    "they also find defects in the p - p dimer rows as well as anti - phase boundaries . at slightly below a ml p coverage , wang _ et al . _",
    "observe si - si , si - p and p - p dimers . at still lower coverages ,",
    "there are ` significant ' numbers of si - si and si - p dimers , while there are some p - p dimers .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite using stm , x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) and total energy calculations conclude that after low temperature ph@xmath2 adsorption there are dimers on the surface .",
    "it is not conclusive whether these are p - p , si - p or si - si dimers , though they expect p - p dimers to be dominant at low temperatures .",
    "both these groups ( wang _ et al . _ and kipp _ et al .",
    "_ ) observe similar ` bright ' features above si - si surface dimers in their stm images at low p coverages .",
    "_ claim these to be indicative of si - si dimers , while kipp _ et al . _ claim these to be p - p dimers .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , from their stm studies , conclude that at low p coverages , the surface , in fact , contains si - si and si - p dimers , thus supporting wang _",
    "s conclusions .",
    "et al . _ also found that after ph@xmath2 adsorption at 625@xmath3 c , there are only symmetric p - p dimers on the surface . at the maximum p coverage ,",
    "they find defects like missing dimer rows . from thermal desorption spectra of p from the si(001 )",
    "surface , hirose and sakamoto  @xcite claim that at low coverages ( @xmath4 ml ) , there are mostly si - p dimers on the surface . above @xmath5 ml coverage , p - p , si - p dimers and defects coexist on the surface .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in their core - level photoemission and stm studies find that at @xmath6 k the surface is interspersed with chains of p - p dimers . at @xmath7",
    "k the hydrogen atoms desorb completely and one observes partial replacement of si atoms by p.    thus apart from some differences in the details , most experiments agree that after the hydrogen from ph@xmath2 has been desorbed , the surface consists mostly of p - p dimers at higher coverages . at low coverages",
    "there is agreement that p replaces si atoms and gets incorporated into the surface , but one would like to have a more detailed understanding of the structure .",
    "there have been a few theoretical studies addressing the question whether ph@xmath2 adsorbs dissociatively or molecularly on si(001 )  @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", there are no systematic theoretical studies of p - covered si(001 ) surface as a function of coverage .",
    "since it is the p atoms which are important in applications , one would like to understand their interaction with and structure on the si(001 ) surface .",
    "therefore , we study stable atomic structure of p - covered si(001 ) surface starting from a low coverage up to a ml . apart from finding the most favorable binding site for a p ad - atom on this surface , we study p - p dimers on si(001 ) in detail because they turn out to be a more favorable arrangement compared to isolated p atoms .",
    "we also compare the structure and energetics of p - p ad - dimers with al - al ad - dimers about which much is known .",
    "we arrive at the important conclusion that unlike al - si system , p - si system always prefer an ortho - dimer structure and does not show a para to ortho transition with increasing coverage .",
    "since p - si hetero - dimers have been observed in experiments , we have also studied the energetics of replacement of surface si atoms with p. in fact , at low p coverages , this replacement of surface si atoms is a more favorable arrangement than adsorption of the p ad - atoms or dimers above the surface .",
    "interestingly , the bright lines and zig - zag features observed in ref .",
    "@xcite are related to this replacement process . in what follows",
    ", we discuss the methods used , and the results of our calculations in detail .",
    "calculations were performed using pseudopotential method within dft .",
    "we use vasp  @xcite for our calculations .",
    "the wave functions are expressed in a plane wave basis with an energy cutoff of @xmath8 ev .",
    "the brillouin zone integrations are performed using the monkhorst - pack scheme  @xcite .",
    "ionic potentials are represented by ultra - soft vanderbilt type pseudopotentials  @xcite .",
    "we use the generalized gradient approximation ( gga )  @xcite for the exchange - correlation energy . the preconditioned conjugate gradient method ( as implemented in vasp )",
    "is used for wave function optimization and conjugate gradient is used for ionic relaxation .",
    "we use a @xmath9 * k*-point mesh for our @xmath10 surface supercell , while for the @xmath11 surface supercell , we use a @xmath12 * k*-point mesh .",
    "convergence with respect to energy cutoff and number of * k * points has been previously tested for similar systems  @xcite . when making comparison between binding energies of structures with same supercell size , it is expected that the errors due to cutoff and * k*-point mesh will cancel .",
    "the @xmath13 surface is represented by a repeated slab geometry .",
    "each slab contains 5 si atomic layers with hydrogen atoms passivating the si atoms at the bottom layer of the slab .",
    "consecutive slabs are isolated from each other by a vacuum space of 9  .",
    "the si atoms in the top four atomic layers are allowed to relax , while the bottom layer si atoms and passivating h atoms are kept fixed in order to simulate bulk - like termination .",
    "we reproduced the energetics and geometry of the @xmath14 reconstructions of a clean si(001 ) surface using the above parameters  @xcite .",
    "our calculations provide cohesive energy of a supercell composed of given set of atoms , @xmath15=e_{t}[sc]-e_{a}[atoms]\\label{eq : ec}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] is the cohesive energy of the supercell , @xmath17 $ ] is the total energy of the supercell , and @xmath18 $ ] is the total energy of all the isolated atoms that constitute the supercell .",
    "thus @xmath16 $ ] is the energy gained by assembling the given supercell structure from the isolated atoms .",
    "we define the binding energy ( be ) of @xmath19 p atoms , @xmath20 as , @xmath21-e_{c}[\\mathrm{si+\\mathnormal{n}p } ] \\label{eq : eb1}\\ ] ] where @xmath22}$ ] is the cohesive energy of the si slab , and @xmath23}$ ] is the cohesive energy with @xmath19 p atoms adsorbed / incorporated into the slab .",
    "the cohesive energies of the si slab with and without p are calculated in the same supercell with fully relaxed atomic configurations . written in terms of the total energies , it is easy to see from eqn .",
    "[ eq : ec ] , that the be can be expressed as , @xmath24 - e_t\\mathrm{[si+\\mathnormal{n}p ] } + n e_a[\\mathrm{p } ] \\label{eq : eb2}\\ ] ]    it should be noted that in order to compare stabilities of two structures , one should compare their formation energies ( fe ) , which , in case of an ` interstitial ' impurity ( in this case , added p atoms may replace si atoms in the slab , but they all remain within the system ) can be written as  @xcite @xmath25 - e_t[\\mathrm{si } ] - n\\mu_p   \\label{eq : fei}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 $ ] is the total energy of the si slab with the @xmath19 p atoms , @xmath27 $ ] is the total energy of the si slab , and @xmath28 is the chemical potential of phosphorous in its reference state . in the case",
    "when different structures being compared have equal number of si and p atoms , one can see from eqns  [ eq : eb2 ] and  [ eq : fei ] that comparing their fe s is equivalent to comparing their be s , since difference in fe s is just the negative of the difference in be s . also , if the reference state is taken to be a gas of isolated atoms , which is probably appropriate in mbe conditions , then the fe of a structure is just the negative of its be .",
    "however , in case of a ` substitutional ' impurity , when a si atom replaced by a p atom leaves the system and goes to a reservoir ( again assumed to be a gas of isolated si atoms ) , the formation energy is given by  @xcite @xmath29 \\\\           & - & e_t[\\mathrm{n\\ ; atom\\ ; si\\ ; slab } ] \\\\           & + & e_a[\\mathrm{si } ] - e_a[\\mathrm{p } ] \\label{eq : fes}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , from eqn  [ eq : ec ] , it is easy to see that this is equal to the difference between the cohesive energies of an @xmath30-atom si slab in which one si is replaced by a p atom , and a the clean @xmath30-atom si slab .    in this work ,",
    "we mostly study stabilities of various structures having the same number of si and p atoms , as suggested by experiments . hence comparing their be s",
    "serves the purpose , higher be implying a more stable structure . in case of an isolated p being incorporated in the si slab",
    ", we also compare stabilities of these two structures : 1 .",
    "the ejected si remains in the slab ; and 2 .",
    "it goes to a reservoir . for this",
    ", we do have to compare the fe s , as discussed in the next section .",
    "in the subsequent subsections , we present results of our calculations in detail . we calculate the energetics of p adsorption on the surface , and replacement of surface si atoms by p when we have an isolated p ad - atom , and at @xmath1 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and a full ml coverages . [",
    "sec : sparse ]      as stated earlier , for p atoms on the si(001 ) surface , we have considered two possibilities : they get adsorbed on the surface or they replace si atoms and get incorporated into the surface . in the first case , we have calculated the be of a single p ad - atom adsorbed at four symmetry sites on the @xmath0 asymmetric si(001 ) surface .",
    "the symmetry sites are : i ) dimer site ( * d * ) on top of the si surface dimer , ii ) the site vertically above the second layer si atom between two atoms of adjacent si dimers belonging to the same dimer row ( * m * ) , iii ) cave site ( * c * ) between two si surface dimers perpendicular to the dimer rows and iv ) quasi - hexagonal site ( * h * ) half - way between two si surface dimers along a dimer row .",
    "these sites are marked in fig  [ fig : sites ] .",
    "we used a @xmath10 surface supercell .",
    "the large size of the supercell ensures that the interaction between a p atom in our supercell and its periodic images are small and the be represents that of an isolated p atom .",
    "while studying be of a p ad - atom at these sites , we relax the p atom , and the top four si layers .",
    "the be values of the p atom at these sites are given in table  [ table : be164ml ] . in table",
    "[ table : be164ml ] we also give be of one p atom in a @xmath11 surface cell corresponding to @xmath31 ml , which is discussed in detail later .",
    "the * m * site turns out to be the most favorable site for an isolated p ad - atom .",
    "this is also the most favorable site for an isolated si ad - atom on si(001 ) first discovered by brocks _",
    "et al . _",
    "here p ad - atom binds to two si atoms belonging to two different dimers in the same surface dimer row .",
    "these bonds are of equal length ( 2.3  ) with si - p - si bond angle @xmath33 , suggesting that p likes to be close to a tetrahedrally bonded configuration .",
    "another significant observation is that the p ad - atom at the * m*-site is only 2.26    away from the second layer si atom .",
    "this is a bond similar in character to the si - p bonds at the surface as seen in the charge density plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : sd_charge](a ) .",
    "thus the second layer si atom bonded to p becomes five - fold coordinated probably accompanied by weakening of its bonds with other si atoms .",
    "this weakening of bonds costs energy , but p being 3-fold coordinated at the * m * site is beneficial energetically compared to the * d * site , where the p ad - atom is only two - fold coordinated .",
    "it is also found that when the p atom is at the * d * site , the si - p - si bonds make an angle of 64@xmath3 .",
    "this angle is much smaller than an ideal tetrahedral angle of 109@xmath3 .",
    "so there is a bond rotation on the p atom at the * d * site which costs energy .",
    "an interplay of these factors makes the * m * site more favorable by 0.2 ev compared to the * d * site .",
    "we show the charge density contour plots in the plane of the p ad - atom and the two surface si atoms it binds with at the * m * and * d * sites in fig  [ fig : sd_charge](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "the nature of p - si bonding at the two sites is similar , so it is the bond rotation at the * d * site , and rearrangement of bonds the second layer si atom forms , that make the * m * site more favorable .",
    "energetically , * m * and * d * sites are followed by the * h * and * c * sites . at the * h * and",
    "* c * sites , the p ad - atom can bind to four and two surface si atoms respectively .",
    "however , being an @xmath34 element , and having a small atomic radius , it can not take full advantage of all the neighboring surface si atoms . hence * h * site turns out to have a lower be than the * m * and * d * sites .",
    "the * c * site has the lowest be .",
    "it has been seen before that the size of an ad - atom can have dramatic effects on its binding properties on a substrate  @xcite .",
    "thus while the * m * site was found to be the most favorable site as stated before , for an al ad - atom , * h * site turned out to the most favorable  @xcite .",
    ".be ( ev / atom ) for an isolated p ad - atom at different symmetry sites on a si(001)-@xmath0 surface at two different coverages . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in structures * iv * and * v * , two p dimers are put one lattice spacing apart in the initial configuration .",
    "atomic relaxation starting from these geometries indicate that it is energetically highly unfavorable for two p - p dimers to come so close to each other at this coverage .",
    "there is a repulsion between the two dimers and they tend to move away from each other .",
    "now we present our results for @xmath31 ml p coverage studied with one p ad - atom on a @xmath11 surface supercell .",
    "we put the p ad - atom at * m * , * d * , * h * , and * c * sites .",
    "a look at table  [ table : be164ml ] shows that be s at * m * , * d * and * h * sites are essentially the same as those for an isolated si atom .",
    "however , binding at the * c * site is significantly stronger in the present case . at * m",
    "* , * d * and * h * sites , an isolated p atom is already reasonably strongly bonded to the neighboring surface si atoms .",
    "however , the p - si bonding at the * c * site is rather weak , which leaves the isolated p ad - atom with localized electrons on it . at @xmath31 ml , the p atom finds other p atoms at nearby * c * sites , which gives these localized electrons a channel to delocalize .",
    "this delocalization lowers the kinetic energy of the electrons , and makes the binding stronger .",
    "we also find that at @xmath31 ml coverage , two p - p dimers on a @xmath10 surface cell have a stronger binding than a single p ad - atom on a @xmath11 surface cell .",
    "this shows that dimer formation by p ad - atoms on the si(001 ) surface significantly lowers their energy .",
    "in case of p incorporation into the surface , when we have one p atom on a @xmath11 surface cell , the ejected si is placed in geometry * i * as explained in fig  [ fig:1pinc ] .",
    "the ejected si and top four atomic layers are relaxed . in the converged geometry ,",
    "the be is found to be 6.1 ev per p ad - atom .",
    "while putting four p atoms on a @xmath10 surface cell , there can be several possibilities .",
    "however , we are guided by our calculations at @xmath1 ml , where we found that two ejected si atoms prefer to dimerize on top of and perpendicular to surface si dimer row .",
    "we thus incorporated all the four p atoms in the dimers in a row of our @xmath10 cell , and put the ejected si atoms above the other dimer row .",
    "the starting configuration is shown in fig  [ fig:44_4pinc ] . in the relaxed geometry ,",
    "the ejected si atoms form two asymmetric dimers , as expected .",
    "the be turns out to be 6.2 ev per p atom .",
    "there is slight energy gain relative to the @xmath11 cell due to dimerization of ejected si atoms .    now",
    "a comparison of be s for p adsorbed and p incorporated geometries shows that at @xmath31 ml , p adsorption is more favorable than p incorporation by 0.1 ev .",
    "thus we reach the significant conclusion that at a critical coverage whose value lies between @xmath1 ml and @xmath31 ml , p atoms prefer to get adsorbed on the surface and form p - p ortho - dimers , rather than getting incorporated in the surface .",
    "note that , while at @xmath31 ml p adsorption is more favorable , in experiments , it is not surprising to find some p incorporation concurrently .      at @xmath32 ml",
    "also we calculated the energetics of p incorporation into si(001 ) surface , though it is expected that adsorption would be more favorable at this coverage .",
    "in fact , that is what we find in our calculations . in order to study adsorption at @xmath32 ml p coverage",
    ", we put two p ad - atoms in a dimerized position on a @xmath11 surface cell .",
    "we again calculated energies of p - p para - dimer and ortho - dimer on top of a surface dimer row .",
    "these two geometries are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:22_2pposs](a ) .",
    "it turns out that the ortho - dimer is a more favorable configuration .",
    "the p - p dimer distance is found to be 2.27    while the si - p distance is 2.34  .",
    "the underlying si dimers are symmetrized , but the si - si dimer distance still remains to be 2.33  .",
    "thus the local geometry and bonding around a p - p ad - dimer is similar to that found around an ad - dimer in case of @xmath1 ml with a similar value for the be .",
    "the be turns out to be 6.3 ev per p atom .",
    "the para - dimer configuration has a be of 5.9 ev per p. so we find another crucial difference between al - al and p - p dimers on si(001 ) .",
    "al - al dimers showed a transition from a para- to ortho- orientation with increasing coverage  @xcite , but p - p dimers always prefer an ortho- orientation .    in order to study p incorporation , we replace two si atoms in two dimers on a @xmath11 surface cell by p atoms .",
    "there are several possibilities where the ejected si atoms can go .",
    "we have considered four possible arrangements for two ejected si atoms that are shown in fig .  [ fig:22_2pposs](b ) .",
    "the geometry * i * and the ortho - dimer geometry ( * iii * ) of the si atoms turn out to be very close in be .",
    "the be of geometry * iii * is 5.97 ev per p atom and that of geometry * i * is 5.95 ev per p atom .",
    "the para - dimer geometry ( * iv * ) has a be of 5.45 ev per p atom .",
    "geometry * ii * turns out to be the least favorable with a be of 5.12 ev per p atom .    at one ml coverage , we put four p atoms on a @xmath11 surface supercell .",
    "again , a symmetric dimer - row structure of the p ad - atoms turns out to be the most favorable one .",
    "this is same as the structure found for a ml as - covered si(001 ) .",
    "the geometry of a full ml p covered si(001 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:22_2pdim ] . the p - p dimer distance in the the relaxed structure",
    "is calculated to be 2.3  .",
    "the si - p distance is found to be 2.38  .",
    "the be for p - p ad - dimers is found to be 6.4 ev per p atom at full ml coverage .",
    "another important feature seen at this coverage is that the reconstruction of the underlying si surface is lifted , just as was found for as on si(001 ) .",
    "we have seen that it is unfavorable for two p - p dimers to come too close to each other on the surface .",
    "some of this strain could be released by missing p - p dimer rows as found in experiments .",
    "however , since we are studying full ml coverage with a @xmath35 surface supercell , we can not explore this possibility in our calculations .",
    "our findings that at higher coverages p adsorption becomes more favorable , and that p ad - atoms prefer to form dimers , are consistent with the conclusions reached by yu _",
    "et al . _ and wang _ et al . _",
    "we have done a systematic first - principles pseudopotential density functional study of structural changes induced by p on si(001 ) .",
    "for adsorption of an isolated p atom , the * m * site turns our to be energetically most favorable .",
    "however , up to a p coverage of @xmath1 ml , replacement of surface si atom by p is even more beneficial energetically due to the participation of the * m * site .",
    "the resulting si - p hetero dimers give rise to the zig - zag and associated bright features in stm images .",
    "the ejected si atoms prefer to form dimer chains perpendicular to the surface dimer rows . at some critical coverage between @xmath1 ml and @xmath31 ml",
    ", adsorption of p becomes more favorable than incorporation into the surface . at all coverages , p - p ortho - dimers on top of si dimer rows",
    "are more favorable than para - dimers .",
    "this is in contrast to al - al dimers on si(001 ) which prefer to reside between surface dimer rows , and show a transition from an para- to ortho- orientation with increasing coverage . at @xmath32",
    "ml coverage p ad - atoms also form dimers . at a full ml coverage p atoms",
    "show a propensity to form dimer rows after lifting reconstruction of the si surface",
    ". there could be some missing dimer rows to relieve strain in the system .",

    "<S> renewed focus on the p - si system due to its potential application in quantum computing and self - directed growth of molecular wires , has led us to study structural changes induced by p upon placement on si(001)-@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> using first - principles density functional theory ( dft ) based pseudopotential method , we have performed calculations for p - si(001 ) system , starting from an isolated p atom on the surface , and systematically increasing the coverage up to a full monolayer . </S>",
    "<S> an isolated p atom can favorably be placed on an * m * site between two atoms of adjacent si dimers belonging to the same si dimer row . but being incorporated in the surface is even more energetically beneficial due to the participation of the * m * site as a receptor for the ejected si . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show that up to @xmath1 monolayer coverage , hetero - dimer structure resulting from replacement of surface si atoms with p is energetically favorable . </S>",
    "<S> recently observed zig - zag features in stm are found to be consistent with this replacement process . </S>",
    "<S> as coverage increases , the hetero - dimers give way to p - p ortho - dimers on the si dimer rows . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is similar to that of si - si d - dimers but are to be contrasted with the al - al dimers , which are found between adjacent si dimers rows and in a para - dimer arrangement . </S>",
    "<S> unlike al - si system p - si does not show any para to ortho transition . </S>",
    "<S> for both systems , the surface reconstruction is lifted at about one monolayer coverage . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations help us in understanding the experimental data obtained using scanning tunneling microscope . </S>"
