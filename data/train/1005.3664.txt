    "experimental and theoretical investigations of tunneling through impurity atom energy level in the case of multichannel transport reveal fano - type line shape in local tunneling conductivity when stm metallic tip is positioned above the impurity @xcite .",
    "transformation of fano - type line shape in local tunneling conductivity depending on distance value from impurity was also recently investigated @xcite .",
    "most of the experiments are carried out with the help of scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy technique @xcite and theoretical calculations usually deals with green s functions formalism @xcite .",
    "comparison between experimental sts results obtained at different distance values from the impurity @xcite and theoretical investigations of single impurities influence on tunneling conductivity @xcite provide information weather electron transport occurs coherently or incoherently and gives an opportunity to initialize impurity type .",
    "all these effects are caused by local changes of the initial density of states due to interactions of non - equilibrium particles in the contact area .",
    "taking into account coulomb interaction of conduction electrons with non - equilibrium localized charges can result in nontrivial behavior of tunneling characteristics calculated in the case of stm metallic tip positioned above the impurity atom @xcite",
    ". however influence of coulomb interaction effects on local tunneling conductivity measured apart from the impurity is a problem of great interest due to the possibility of impurities types initialization .",
    "so in this work we present the modification of formula , which describe spatial distribution of local tunneling conductivity in vicinity of impurity in the case of interference between resonant and direct tunneling channels @xcite due to coulomb interaction .",
    "we performed calculations for two extreme cases when resonant tunneling takes place through deep impurity state and through shallow impurity state .",
    "we applied mean field self - consistent approach for shallow impurity state and in the case of deep impurity non - equilibrium coulomb interaction effects were studied with the use of hubbard - i model .",
    "both approaches were analysed with the use of keldysh formalism @xcite .",
    "we have found that taking into account coulomb interaction in addition to interference between tunneling channels leads to drastical changing of the tunneling conductivity form depending on the values of tunneling rates and distance from impurity .",
    "we shall analyze tunneling between semiconductor surface ( @xmath0 atomic chain ) and metallic stm tip for deep and shallow impurities in the presence of coulomb interaction .",
    "the model of tunneling contact formed by semiconductor and metallic tip is depicted in fig . [ 1 ] .",
    "@xmath0 atomic chain consists of similar atoms with energy levels @xmath1 and similar tunneling transfer amplitudes @xmath2 between the atoms .",
    "distance between the atoms in the chain is the same and equal to @xmath3 .",

    "direct tunneling between the surface continuous spectrum states and tip states is described by the transfer amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "the model system semiconductor - impurity state - metallic tip in the presence of coulomb interaction can be described by the hamiltonian : @xmath8 :    @xmath9 @xmath10 indices @xmath11 and @xmath12 label the states in the left ( semiconductor ) and right ( tip ) lead , respectively .",
    "the index @xmath13 indicates that impurity electron operator is involved .",

    "non - equilibrium processes @xcite one can get expression for the spatial distribution of local tunneling conductivity without coulomb interaction @xcite :    @xmath22    where impurity retarded green s function is defined by the expression : @xmath23 relaxation rates @xmath24 , @xmath25 are determined by electron tunneling transitions from localized states to the leads @xmath11 and @xmath12 continuum states and relaxation rate @xmath26 corresponds to direct tunneling transitions between @xmath11 and @xmath12 continuum states @xmath27 ; @xmath28 ; @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 is unperturbed density of states in semiconductor .",
    "expression for @xmath31 can be found from the @xmath0 atomic chain dispersion law : @xmath32        let us now analyze modification of formula [ expression_1 ] due to coulomb interaction effects in the case of deep impurities with the help of hubbard - i model ( hamiltonian of suggested model has the form of expression [ expression ] ) .",
    "taking into account coulomb interaction in this model leads to formation of two well separeted impurity energy levels @xmath33 and @xmath34 instead of one initial level @xmath33 .",
    "it is reasonable to use approximation in which the strongest interaction of the considered model - the on - site coulomb repulsion @xmath14 - is included in @xmath35 .",
    "so we can write down expression for @xmath35 :    @xmath36    with the help of keldysh diagram technique @xcite using system of dyson equations one can get expression for impurity retarded green s function .",
    "@xmath37    to evaluate the dependence of local tunneling conductivity on the distance from the deep impurity in the presence of coulomb interaction expressions for @xmath38 and @xmath39 in formula [ expression_1 ] have to be retarded by expressions for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "figure [ 2 ] shows tunneling conductivity as a function of applied bias voltage for different values of distance from the deep impurity .",
    "tunneling conductivity calculated above the impurity has a resonant dip when applied bias voltage is equal to impurity energy level position @xmath47 both for taking ( fig .",
    "[ 2]a black line ) and not taking into account coulomb interaction effects ( fig .",
    "[ 2]a gray line ) .",
    "tunneling conductivity calculated above the impurity in the presence of coulomb interaction also reveals peak at the value of applied bias voltage equal to initial impurity energy level position shifted on the value of coulomb potential @xmath48 in comparison with the case when coulomb interaction effects are neglected .    at the fixed parameters of tunneling contact existance of a dip or a peak in tunneling conductivity in both resonances when applied bias voltage is equal to the impurity energy levels positions",
    "is determined by the value of a distance .",
    "it is clearly evident that in the case of deep impurity state coulomb interaction effects lead to negligible shift of a resonant peculiarity which corresponds to value of applied bias voltage equal to initial impurity energy level position @xmath47 .",
    "suggested model also demonstrates absence of resonant peculiarities spreading with increasing of relaxation rates and distance value from the impurity .",
    "now let us analyze modification of formula [ expression_1 ] due to coulomb interaction effects in the situation of shallow impurity state . in this case coulomb interaction effects",
    "can be taken into account with the help of mean - field approximation ( adopted parameters of the model correspond to the mixed valence regime ) .",
    "it means simply that impurity energy level position depends on coulomb interaction of the non - equilibrium electron density .",
    "new impurity energy level position improved by coulomb interaction can be found from the equation :    @xmath49    where @xmath4 is the initial position of impurity energy level without coulomb interaction .",
    "now the main point is that the non - equilibrium electron filling numbers @xmath50 for impurity atom must satisfy self - consistency condition :    @xmath51    where @xmath38 is determined from equation [ expression_2 ] considering @xmath52 substitution instead of @xmath4 .",
    "impurity filling numbers @xmath53 can be found from kinetic equations for keldysh functions @xmath54 @xcite :    @xmath55    after calculating impurity atom electron filling numbers @xmath50 from the system of equations [ expression_2 ] , [ expression_3]-[expression_5 ] we can determine new position of impurity energy level @xmath52 .",

    "[ 3]a gray line ) shows a resonant dip when applied bias voltage is equal to impurity energy level position @xmath47 .",
    "considering coulomb interaction for shallow impurities in the mean field approximation leads to a resonant dip shift to the higher values of applied bias voltage ( fig .",
    "[ 3]a black line ) .",
    "this effect also takes place with increasing of the distance value from the impurity moreover shift is accompanied by dip s spreading ( fig .",
    "[ 3]b black line ) .",
    "dip s spreading is a result of both impurity initial energy level movement due to coulomb interaction effects and increasing of relaxation rates in the studied system .",
    "it was found that dip s spreading is mostly significant when relaxation rate value exceeds value of initial impurity energy level position @xmath4 .",
    "further increasing of distance ( fig .",
    "[ 3]c black line ) shows disappearing of the resonant dip in the case of coulomb interaction opposing to the calculations carried out without taking into account coulomb interaction effects ( fig .",
    "[ 3]c gray line ) .",
    "disappearing of a dip is a result of nearest to the dip peaks spreading ( one of the peaks corresponds to the lower value of applied bias voltage and another to the higher value of applied bias voltage in comparison with dip position ) .",
