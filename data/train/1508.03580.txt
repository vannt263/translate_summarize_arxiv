    "according to the @xmath12 cold dark matter ( @xmath12cdm ) paradigm , structure formation follows a hierarchical scenario ; dark matter halo growth occurs via the accretion of smaller size systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "high - resolution cosmological simulations have demonstrated that dm substructures survive within environments similar to the milky way@xcite .",
    "galaxy mergers are believed to be the main drivers for significant kinematical perturbations of galaxies@xcite ; these can be classified into three categories . with regards to theoretical@xcite and observational evidences , ( e.g. @xcite ) `` major '' mergers ( mass ratios @xmath13 1:3 of total galaxy mass ) strongly perturb the system and can even change the morphology .",
    "however such events are less common compared to `` minor '' mergers with masses in the range 1:3 - 1:50 of total mass  1:1 of disc mass  which are likely to destroy thin discs@xcite .",
    "the third type , which forms the basis of this study , is the interaction of satellite galaxies with intermediate mass ratios which are more commonly represented in units of the disc mass ( @xmath14 1:10 of disc mass ) .",
    "our milky way galaxy has been experiencing such mergers ; observations of stellar tidal stream remnants provide evidence for such encounters ( e.g. @xcite ) . understanding the evolution of disc galaxies has challenged both observers and theorists for the past two decades .",
    "there have been numerous attempts at bridging the observed characteristics of spiral galaxies and their violent history ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "some of the early studies , including that by@xcite indicated that interaction of substructures with galactic discs could induce heating processes resulting in thickening of the disc . also the @xmath12cdm scenario predicts a continuous infall of subhaloes  including massive satellites , which are expected to impact the dynamics of the stellar disc significantly@xcite .",
    "however early observations of our solar neighbourhood found the presence of a 10 gyr old `` thin '' disc with a scale height @xmath10 500pc ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the survival of a thin disc in the ( @xmath12cdm ) universe has been tested through early analytic models ( e.g. @xcite ) together with n - body / hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "one of the major shortcomings of analytical approaches was the choice of nearly circular satellite orbits .",
    "this is not in agreement with the @xmath12cdm results , where eccentric orbits are favoured@xcite .",
    "another disadvantage was the use of a rigid potential for the host halo , disc and/or bulge instead of live components .",
    "rigid potentials suppress the effect of interactions between the halo and the disc , as well as the dynamical friction  and hence transfer of angular momentum  between different components as",
    "the satellites spiral towards the centre.@xcite have shown that using a rigid potential instead of a live halo overestimates the heating of the galactic disc by a factor of 1.5 - 2 .",
    "early numerical simulations suffered from an unrealistic high abundance of substructure compared to the @xmath12cdm cosmology prediction .",
    "in addition to galaxy mergers , other proposed mechanisms are expected to contribute towards the heating . for example,@xcite and@xcite looked into the induced changes of disc s phase - space distribution due to transient spiral waves and concluded that such structures are able to increase the velocity dispersion of stars , although in the disc plane , an increase of the velocity anisotropy and hence smaller @xmath15 is observed .",
    "scattering due to giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) is another possible scenario@xcite .",
    "an overview of possible disc heating mechanisms are discussed in the review by@xcite .",
    "more recent simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) have shown that infall of satellite galaxies could result in either destroying or greatly heating the disc , forming a _ thick _ component ; this contradicts our picture of the milky way thin disc component .",
    "it is important to note these analyses focussed on the impact of satellites at the massive end of the substructure spectrum , with masses @xmath9 5 @xmath16 10@xmath17 @xmath18 . for instance,@xcite",
    "concluded that accretion of a satellite with mass comparable to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ",
    "10@xmath19 @xmath18  is sufficient to explain the thick disc formation .",
    "also@xcite examined the role of a gas component in disc instability and found , that for a gas mass fraction of 25 percent , the thickening of the disc could decrease by 20 percent  thus suppressing vertical heating . in addition,@xcite",
    "and@xcite showed that satellites infall could also induce radial migration in mw - like systems with greater impact at larger radii , while@xcite and@xcite concluded that radial migration has minimal impact on the thickening of the mw disc .",
    "the radial migration as a result of mergers reduces the disc flaring@xcite which provides an opposite picture to the measured one , especially in the outer parts , in the absence of external perturbations as demonstrated by@xcite . based on perturbation",
    "theory,@xcite have shown that energy deposit in the perturbation by satellites , scales as the square of the satellite mass , and that in the resonance situation , minor mergers may have a measurable impact on the host galaxy . in a cosmologically",
    "based hydrodynamical simulation , @xcite have shown that even a distant encounter of a satellite galaxy with @xmath20 ( @xmath5 5 per cent of the host galaxy mass ) at r=80kpc can perturb the outer disc at r @xmath9 12kpc significantly and form a monoceros ring - like warp .",
    "the observations of the local stellar kinematics have suggested multiple scenarios for the evolution of the thin disc .",
    "the most useful observational quantity in order to investigate the evolution of our milky way disc is the so - called  age - velocity dispersion  relation .",
    "this relation is aimed at connecting stars kinematics with their dynamical history and providing constraints on the vertical structure of the galactic disc.@xcite and follow - up studies ( e.g. @xcite ) have favoured a picture in which the disc has experienced continuous heating through its lifetime .",
    "another possible scenario is the saturation of vertical heating of stars older than 4.5 gyr , as suggested by a detailed analysis of the geneva - copenhagen survey@xcite.@xcite fitted power laws to the radial , tangential , vertical and total velocity dispersions of @xmath21 2600 f and g dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood and derived power law exponents of @xmath22=0.39 , 0.40 , 0.53 and 0.40 for these respective quantities .    within the framework of this study , we use high - resolution n - body simulations@xcite to investigate the impact of accreting satellite galaxies on the dynamics of our milky way `` thin '' disc and",
    "answer the question : are we able to explain the observed heating of the galactic disc in the presence of satellites infall ?",
    "for improved realism , the initial conditions ( ics ) of our satellites follow that of the @xmath12cdm model@xcite .",
    "the interactions of satellites and the stellar disc have the potential to trigger different types of both small and global scale perturbations , such as initiating modes in the galactic disc .",
    "hence , for a deeper understanding of such distortions in the phase - space distribution of disc stars , we require simulations that are capable of resolving the dynamics down to few tens of _ parsecs _ scale ; a resolution much higher than most current milky way interaction analysis simulations . we employ multi - component models for our milky way which enable us to use both observational and cosmological constraints for modelling our galaxy@xcite .",
    "this work improves the current knowledge about the impact of subhalo interactions on the observed vertical structure of our galactic disc .",
    "such structure is the result of a complex interplay of different heating mechanisms and , since we do not yet know about the exact contribution from each of such mechanisms , quantifying one will provide a more accurate picture of other processes . for the first time , we have analysed and compared the impact of subhaloes from aquarius and via lactea slowromancap2@ milky way - like simulation suites ( e.g. @xcite ) to provide a statistically valid study of satellite impact on the vertical structure of the stellar disc of our galaxy .",
    "in addition , having initial conditions for the mw multi - component galaxy which are in much better equilibrium state , compared to previous work , allows us to minimize the bias effect which , in principle , could overshadow the expected real heating measurements .",
    "the combination of 40pc vertical resolution together with ics in a robust equilibrium state differentiates this analysis compared to previous studies  allowing minor vertical heating effects to be measured and distinguished from other processes .    in section[sec :",
    "sim - suite ] we discuss the cosmological simulation suites that we use for the purpose of our realistic initial conditions of dm structures together with the statistics of such objects . the n - body model used for the multi - component milky way and satellites , a description of our n - body code and the isolated systems simulation results are explained in section[sec : model ] .",
    "the results of simulations with satellites for the solar neighbourhood and across the disc , together with an analysis of the orientation of subhalo distribution , are discussed in section[sec : results ] and we finish the paper with a summary in section[sec : summary ] .",
    "for a realistic picture of the interaction between satellite galaxies and the milky way s thin disc we have extracted the distribution of subhaloes from two suites of cosmological simulations : aquarius and via lactea slowromancap2@ ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the major difference between the aquarius and via lactea slowromancap2@ ( hereafter vlii ) lies in their adopted cosmology , which in the case of aquarius are the wmap one - year results@xcite , while for vlii wmap three - year results were used .",
    "hence the value of @xmath23 , which represents the amplitude of the ( linear ) power spectrum on the scale of 8 h@xmath8mpc , is lower for vlii .",
    "this parameter plays a crucial role in the context of influencing structure growth at early epoch .",
    "also n@xmath24 corresponds to the spectral index of scalar fluctuations ( table[tab:1 ] ) and is close to being scale - invariant .",
    "the value for @xmath25 , @xmath26 and n@xmath24 are smaller for vlslowromancap2@ compared to aquarius which might impact the substructure distribution at the very low mass end .",
    ".the cosmological initial conditions [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the aquarius suite consists of a set of 6 simulations ; each associated with a different realisation of dm halo likely to host a milky way - like galaxy and which has not experienced a recent major merger .",
    "the haloes are chosen from a parent halo of homogeneous resolution .",
    "these simulations are performed in cubic box with side length of 137 mpc while vlslowromancap2@ is performed in a smaller box of length 40 mpc .",
    "the second highest resolution set of aquarius simulations `` aq - a2@xmath27aq - f2 '' are employed for this analysis . in our study",
    "we use the _ _",
    "z__=0 snapshots from all the above simulations , which resemble the present day distribution of subhaloes .",
    "each snapshot contains information for the subhaloes  including the position , velocity , maximum circular velocity v@xmath28 , position of this velocity @xmath29 and tidal mass @xmath0 for every substructure residing within the simulation box .",
    "the parent haloes from these seven cosmological simulations do not possess exactly similar profile characteristics such as @xmath30 , the mass enclosed within the sphere with radius @xmath31 , where @xmath31 represents the radius at which the mean density of the dm halo is 200 times the critical density of the universe ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "thus , we scale the properties of subhaloes from all seven simulations in terms of their position , velocity and mass using similar scaling relations mentioned by@xcite .",
    "all the simulations were scaled with respect to the @xmath30 of the `` aq - d2 '' simulation - 1.77 @xmath16 10@xmath33 @xmath18 . the quantity _ g _ represents the scaling factor in @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 the subscript `` orig '' corresponds to the original non - scaled quantities .",
    "such scaling is important for a statistically meaningful comparison of different simulations . after having done the rescaling , all the host haloes have the same mass and size but different concentrations , hence different @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "according to early n - body simulations of dark matter haloes following the @xmath12cdm structure formation model , the density profile of the dm haloes could be well described via the known navarro - frank - white ( nfw ) profile@xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the scale density and scale radius of the subhalo .",
    "the @xmath40 can be computed given the concentration c of the halo which is simply the ratio of @xmath42 and the overdensity @xmath43 with respect to @xmath32 using @xmath44 table[tab:2 ] shows the _ normalised _ properties of the host haloes from vlslowromancap2@ and six aquarius simulations .",
    "the particle resolution of the simulation suites m@xmath45 which is @xmath5 10@xmath46 @xmath18 motivated us to perform a mass cut and consider subhaloes with @xmath0 @xmath1 10@xmath47 @xmath18 since substructures with lower mass consist of only a few hundred particles .",
    "this introduces some uncertainties in determining the characteristics of these subhaloes at the outer regions .",
    "the analysis performed on the subhaloes in this paper include this lower mass cut .",
    "in addition to @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the maximum circular velocity v@xmath28 and concentration c are listed .",
    "for each parent halo we also know @xmath48 , the radius at which the mean density is 50 times @xmath32 ; v@xmath49 , the circular velocity at this radii and @xmath50 , the percentage fraction of the cumulative mass residing in substructures relative to the host halo enclosed mass at @xmath48 and seen as a measure of the host halo clumpiness .",
    "it appears that vlslowromancap2@ has less mass residing in bound substructures ",
    "@xmath51 @xmath21 5 percent  compared to the aquarius simulations .",
    "fig.[fig : clump ] illustrates @xmath52 , which is the substructure mass relative to the halo enclosed mass at @xmath53 , as function of distance from the parent halo s centre for all seven simulations . within the inner 20kpc aq - b2",
    "has the highest subhalo mass fraction , while aq - c2 possesses the lowest value across nearly all radii .",
    "fig.[fig : n ] illustrates an inverse cumulative histogram for the number of subhaloes as function of their normalised @xmath0 .",
    "all the simulations have a similar slope while the scatter in the high - mass regime is the result of low number statistics .",
    "for vlslowromancap2@ the slope decreases at a subhalo mass @xmath14 2 @xmath16 10@xmath47 @xmath18 ; below this mass - range the difference is sensitive to the subhalo finding algorithm and also the mass resolution .",
    "accordingly , the substructure distribution is influenced by lower mass subhaloes that could dominate over higher mass ones by few orders of magnitude in abundance .",

    "if we take into account the 1@xmath11 statistical dispersion around the mean , the thickness of the disc can reach 700pc at the outer parts at 2 gyr .",
    "it is important to note that it is easier to increase the vertical thickness of the particle distribution in the outer regions of the disc than in the inner parts since these particles are less strongly bounded to the disc .",

    "however , the heating rate in the initial 1 gyr is slightly higher than , in the final 1 gyr .",
    "the observed value of 144km@xmath6s@xmath7 lies more than 3@xmath11 above the mean vertical heating taking into account all simulations . according to our analysis , the choice of the orientation of satellites distribution for the aq - d2 case affects the measured vertical heating by less than 8% after 2 gyr in the solar neighbourhood , which is lower than the self - heating of the isolated system .",
    "the orientation plays only a minor role in heating the disc vertically .",
    "the measured heating from this analysis is sub - dominant and significantly smaller than in previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this mainly arises from the fact that our cosmological simulations do not include many subhaloes with @xmath167/@xmath168 @xmath9 0.2 , as was the case in other works , and are thought to heat the disc more significantly .",
    "moreover , the dm clumpiness in aquarius and vlslowromancap2@ is much smaller than that in earlier cosmological simulations , as they suffered from lower mass resolution .",
    "the insufficient heating in our simulations could also be subject to further reduction if we allow for the presence of gas in the disc@xcite .",
    "alternative mechanisms are more likely to dominate the disc heating .",
    "heating by transient spiral arms or by disc growth via mass accretion are discussed in other works ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the increase of disc surface density results in enhanced @xmath159 with contribution towards heating , ranging from less than 5% to 60% for increasing surface density  playing an important role in simulations which allow for disc growth .",
    "coherent bending waves and buckling instabilities are other possible scenarios responsible for increasing the vertical dispersion of disc particles although @xcite and@xcite have shown such mechanisms are inefficient in terms of reproducing the observed vertical heating .",
    "also@xcite and@xcite found that the scattering of disc stars due to gmcs is able to redirect the peculiar velocities of stars out of the plane however the inputted energy is ineffective in increasing the velocities .",
    "the results of this study show that the impact from the subhaloes on the vertical heating of the galactic disc is highly dependent on the high - mass end of the cosmological subhalo distribution ",
    "@xmath0 @xmath68 10@xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "the differences between different simulations can be thought as cosmic variance calculated as the statistical dispersion around the mean value from all simulations .",
    "if we exclude the aq - f2 simulation as the only simulation with 1 subhalo of @xmath0=5.9 @xmath16 10@xmath19 @xmath18 , the impact of satellites reaches only 3km@xmath6s@xmath7 at solar neighbourhood after 2 gyr which is negligible .",
    "the best measure of high mass satellites impact is the flaring of the disc although no strong heating is measured .",
    "such insignificant heating suggests high mass subhaloes are not responsible for the observed heating .",
    "we conclude that 10 - 15% contribution to the observed heating may originate from the impact of subhaloes .",

    "<S> we present a high resolution study of the impact of realistic satellite galaxies , extracted from cosmological simulations of milky way haloes including 6 aquarius suites and via lactea slowromancap2@ , on the dynamics of the galactic disc . </S>",
    "<S> the initial conditions for the multi - component milky way galaxy were generated using the galic code , to ensure a system in dynamical equilibrium state prior to addition of satellites . </S>",
    "<S> candidate subhaloes that came closer than 25kpc to the centre of the host dm haloes with initial mass enclosed within the tidal radius , @xmath0 @xmath1 10@xmath2=0.003 @xmath3 , were identified , inserted into our high resolution n - body simulations and evolved for 2 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> we quantified the vertical heating due to such impacts by measuring the disc thickness and squared vertical velocity dispersion @xmath4 across the disc . according to our analysis the strength of heating is strongly dependent on the high mass end of the subhalo distribution from cosmological simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the mean increase of the vertical dispersion is @xmath5 20km@xmath6s@xmath7gyr@xmath8 for r @xmath9 4kpc with a flat radial profile while , excluding aq - f2 results , the mean heating is @xmath10 12km@xmath6s@xmath7gyr@xmath8 , corresponding to 28% and 17% of the observed vertical heating rate in the solar neighbourhood . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the statistical dispersion around the mean we miss the observed heating rate by more than 3@xmath11 . </S>",
