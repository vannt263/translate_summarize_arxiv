    "in this paper we consider the applications of a new numerical - analytical technique based on the methods of local nonlinear harmonic analysis or wavelet analysis to the calculations of orbital motions in arbitrary n - pole fields .",
    "our main examples are motion in transverse plane for a single particle in a circular magnetic lattice in case when we take into account multipolar expansion up to an arbitrary finite number and particle motion in storage rings .",
    "we reduce initial dynamical problem to the finite number of standard algebraical problems and represent all dynamical variables as expansion in the bases of maximally localized in phase space functions .",
    "our approach in this paper is based on the generalization of variational - wavelet approach from [ 1]-[12 ] .",
    "starting in part 2 from hamiltonians of orbital motion in magnetic lattice with additional kicks terms and rational approximation of classical motion in storage rings , we consider in part 3 variational - biorthogonal formulation for dynamical system with rational nonlinearities and construct explicit representation for all dynamical variables as expansions in nonlinear high - localized eigenmodes .",
    "the magnetic vector potential of a magnet with @xmath0 poles in cartesian coordinates is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a homogeneous function of @xmath3 and @xmath4 of order @xmath5 .",
    "the cases @xmath6 to @xmath7 correspond to low - order multipoles : quadrupole , sextupole , octupole , decapole .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is ( [ 13 ] for designation ) : @xmath8\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we may take into account an arbitrary but finite number of terms in expansion of rhs of hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) and from our point of view the corresponding hamiltonian equations of motions are not more than nonlinear ordinary differential equations with polynomial nonlinearities and variable coefficients . also we may add the terms corresponding to kick type contributions of rf - cavity : @xmath9 or localized cavity @xmath10 with @xmath11 at position @xmath12 .",
    "we consider , as the second example , the particle motion in storage rings in standard approach , which is based on consideration in [ 13 ] . starting from hamiltonian , which described classical dynamics in storage rings and using serret ",
    "frenet parametrization , we have after standard manipulations with truncation of power series expansion of square root the following approximated ( up to octupoles ) hamiltonian for orbital motion in machine coordinates : @xmath13 ^ 2 + [ p_z - h\\cdot x]^2 } { [ 1+f(p_\\sigma)]}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + p_\\sigma-[1+k_x\\cdot x+k_z\\cdot z]\\cdot f(p_\\sigma)\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot[k_x^2+g]\\cdot x^2+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot[k_z^2-g]\\cdot z^2-    n\\cdot xz \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{\\lambda}{6}\\cdot(x^3 - 3xz^2)+\\frac{\\mu}{24}\\cdot(z^4 - 6x^2z^2+x^4 ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{\\beta_0 ^ 2}\\cdot\\frac{l}{2\\pi\\cdot h}\\cdot\\frac{ev(s)}{e_0}\\cdot \\cos\\left[h\\cdot\\frac{2\\pi}{l}\\cdot\\sigma+\\varphi\\right]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we use series expansion of function @xmath14 from [ 13 ] : @xmath15 and the corresponding expansion of rhs of equations corresponding to ( 4 ) . in the following",
    "we take into account only arbitrary polynomial / rational ( in terms of dynamical variables ) expressions .",
    "the first main part of our consideration is some variational approach to these problems , which reduce initial problem to the problem of solution of functional equations at the first stage and some algebraical problems at the second stage .",
    "multiresolution expansion is the second main part of our construction . as a result",
    "the solution is parameterized by solutions of two reduced algebraical problems , one is nonlinear and others are linear problems obtained from wavelet constructions and represented as expansion in a compactly supported wavelet basis .",
    "because integrand of variational functionals is represented by bilinear form ( scalar product ) it seems more reasonable to consider wavelet constructions which take into account all advantages of this structure .",
    "let @xmath16 be a symplectic manifold , @xmath17 is hamiltonian , @xmath18 is unique hamiltonian vector field defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the symplectic structure .",
    "t - periodic solution @xmath21 of the hamiltonian equations @xmath22 on m is a solution , satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath23 @xmath24 .",
    "let us define a function @xmath25 the critical points of @xmath26 are the periodic solutions of @xmath27 .",
    "computing the derivative at @xmath28 in the direction of @xmath29 , we find @xmath30 consequently , @xmath31 for all @xmath29 iff the loop @xmath3 satisfies the equation @xmath32 now we introduce wavelets in our underlying bilinear structure .",
    "let us consider action of operator @xmath33 on @xmath3 @xmath34 which is polynomial / rational in @xmath3 , and have arbitrary dependence on @xmath35 .",
    "then ( 6 ) is equivalent to @xmath36 we start with two hierarchical sequences of approximations spaces [ 14 ] : @xmath37 and corresponding biorthogonal expansions : @xmath38 let @xmath39 be complement to @xmath40 in @xmath41 , but not necessarily orthogonal complement .",
    "orthogonality conditions have the following form : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "translates of @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 , translates of @xmath49 .",
    "biorthogonality conditions are @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "functions @xmath52 form dual pair : @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "functions @xmath55 generate a multiresolution analysis .",
    "@xmath56 , @xmath57 are synthesis functions , @xmath58 , @xmath59 are analysis functions .",
    "synthesis functions are biorthogonal to analysis functions . scaling spaces",
    "are orthogonal to dual wavelet spaces .",
    "two multiresolutions are intertwining @xmath60 .",
    "these are direct sums but not orthogonal sums .",
    "so , our representation ( 11 ) for solution on the level of resolution @xmath61 has now the form @xmath62 where synthesis wavelets are used to synthesize the function .",
    "but @xmath63 come from inner products with analysis wavelets .",
    "biorthogonality yields @xmath64",
    "so , we may use this more useful construction in our variational approach [ 1]-[12 ] .",
    "we have modification only on the level of computing coefficients of reduced nonlinear algebraical system of equations .",
    "this biorthogonal construction is more flexible and stable under the action of large class of operators while orthogonal ( one scale for multiresolution ) is fragile , all computations are much more simpler and we accelerate the rate of convergence . in all types of hamiltonian calculation , which are based on some bilinear structures ( symplectic or poissonian structures , bilinear form of integrand in variational integral ) this framework leads to greater success . in numerical modelling",
    "we may consider very useful wavelet packets . as a result we have from ( 9 ) the following reduced system of algebraical equations ( rsae ) on the set of unknown coefficients @xmath65 of expansions ( 11 ) : @xmath66 where operator l is algebraization of initial problem ( 8) .",
    "@xmath67 are multiindexes , by which are labelled @xmath68 and @xmath69 , the other coefficients of rsae ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) : @xmath70 @xmath71 where p ( q ) is the degree of nominator ( denominator ) part of operator @xmath33 ( 8) , @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "now , when we solve rsae ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) and determine unknown coefficients from formal expansion ( 11 ) we therefore obtain the solution of our initial problem .",
    "it should be noted that if we consider only truncated expansion with n terms then we have from ( [ eq : pol2 ] ) the system of @xmath74 ( @xmath5 is dimension of @xmath3 ( 7 ) ) algebraical equations and the degree of this algebraical system coincides with degree of initial differential system .",
    "the problem of computations of coefficients @xmath68 , @xmath75 ( [ eq : beta ] ) of reduced algebraical system may be explicitly solved in wavelet approach .",
    "the bases functions @xmath76 ( 11 ) are obtained via multiresolution expansions ( 10 ) and represented by compactly supported wavelets . because affine group of translations and dilations is inside the approach , this method resembles the action of a microscope .",
    "we have contribution to final result from each scale of resolution from the whole infinite scale of spaces ( 10 ) .",
    "the solution has the following form @xmath77     sections.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   sections.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all time scales .",
    "formula ( [ eq : z ] ) gives us expansion into a slow part @xmath78 and fast oscillating parts for arbitrary n. so , we may move from coarse scales of resolution to the finest one for obtaining more detailed information about our dynamical process .",
    "the first term in the rhs of equation ( 19 ) corresponds on the global level of function space decomposition to resolution space and the second one to detail space . in this way we give contribution to our full solution from each scale of resolution or each time scale . on fig .  1 we present sections @xmath79 corresponding to model ( 5 ) in different parameter regions .",
