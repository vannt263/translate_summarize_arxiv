    "one of the great successes of atomic physics is its fundamental understanding of the chemical properties of the elements and the explanation of their order within the periodic table . following the atomic number of elements , the ( atomic ) subshells are usually filled for each principal quantum number @xmath5 from the inner to the outer subshells .",
    "prominent exceptions are the @xmath3 and @xmath6 transition elements , and even more so the lanthanide and actinide groups of elements where the @xmath7 and @xmath8 subshells are filled only after shells of the next principal quantum number(s ) have been ( partially ) occupied already . for the lanthanides , especially , this irregularity can be explained by the peculiar shape of the potential of @xmath9-electrons which consists of an inner and an outer well , and which are separated by a centrifugal barrier . for low nuclear charges , the inner",
    "well is too shallow to confine the @xmath9 electrons , so that they are mainly localized in the outer well .",
    "for this reason , the @xmath9-shell behaves first like a diffuse outer shell and remains unfilled until the nuclear charge , and hence the potential , is sufficiently attractive to strongly bind the @xmath9-electrons .",
    "this contraction of the electron density has been addressed in the literature also as the collapse of the @xmath7 wave function  and has been explored since the early days of atomic - structure theory @xcite . for xenon and its neighbour elements ,",
    "in particular , the giant resonance in the photoionization cross section @xcite was shown to be due to a @xmath10 excitation and the quite sudden change in the spatial overlap of the wave functions , if a @xmath6 electron is excited @xcite .",
    "an analogue contraction for a whole series of @xmath11 orbitals is demonstrated in this work for the @xmath3 photoionization of xe@xmath12 ions with charge states @xmath13 . until the present , this collapse of the @xmath11 series has been investigated only in very few studies on the photoabsorption by or ionization of the inner @xmath3 shell , mainly because of a lack of photon sources with sufficient intensity in the required range of energies . for the same reason only neutral targets were considered so far @xcite , which can be prepared with much higher particle densities than ionic targets .",
    "a notable exception ist the work of maste et  al .",
    "@xcite who studied low - charged ions embedded in the lattices of ionic crystals .",
    "the present experimental measurements , with multiply charged ions , employed the photon - ion merged - beam method using the hoton - on spectrometer at traiii ( pipe ) @xcite .",
    "this is a permanently installed end station at the `` variable polarization xuv beamline '' ( p04 ) @xcite of the world s brightest 3@xmath14 generation synchrotron light source at present , petraiii at desy in hamburg , germany .",
    "a description of the experimental setup and the data - analysis procedures has been reported @xcite . in the present experiment ,",
    "xenon ions in charge states @xmath15 were produced in an electron - cyclotron resonance ( ecr ) ion source and accelerated to energies of @xmath16  kev . after the mass / charge selection in a magnetic dipole field , the ions were electrostatically guided onto the photon beam axis .",
    "the current of the well collimated ion beams in the merged - beam interaction region ( @xmath17  m length ) was 40  na , 11  na and 6  na for the @xmath18xe@xmath0 , @xmath18xe@xmath1 and @xmath18xe@xmath2 ions , respectively .",
    "the photon flux as measured with a calibrated photo diode amounted up to @xmath19  s@xmath20 in the 670770  ev photon energy range of the present experiment . a second magnet , after the interaction region , separated the product ions from the primary beam .",
    "the primary ions were directed into a faraday cup , and the product ions were counted with nearly 100% efficiency by a single - particle detector .    the photon energy scale was calibrated with an uncertainty of better than @xmath21  mev by remeasuring known resonances in c@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the experimental photon energy spread was 160  mev , i.e. , a factor of @xmath22 20 lower than in our previous study @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of the cross section scale is @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "in our previous low - resolution study on @xmath3 photoionization of multiply charged xenon ions @xcite we found that product ions were created in a range of charge states .",
    "the relative contribution of each product charge state depends on the cascade of auger and radiative processes that follow the initial inner - shell ionization event .",
    "net triple ionization , i.e. , emission of two electrons by autoionization in addition to the directly ionized electron , was found to be one of the strongest channels .",
    "therefore , in the present high - resolution measurements , where the emphasis is on the spectroscopic aspect of the experiment , only the triple ionization channel was investigated .    measured cross sections for triple photoionization of xe@xmath0 , xe@xmath1 , and xe@xmath2 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : hires ] .",
    "pronounced resonance structures are observed for all ions but with an increasing number of resonances as the charge state of the ions is increased .",
    "in contrast to the usually rather complex cross sections for outer shell ionization of atoms and ions , the present inner - shell ionization cross sections can be interpreted straight - forwardly .",
    "the strongest resonances are associated with the photoexcitation of a @xmath3 electron to an atomic @xmath11 subshell ( @xmath24 ) and the subsequent multiple autoionization of the associated hole states .",
    "the @xmath25 fine structure splitting ( @xmath26  ev ) of the @xmath3 hole leads to two distinct rydberg series of resonances in each spectrum . for xe@xmath0 , for example , resonances with principal quantum numbers @xmath5 from 4 to 7 can be clearly discerned . for xe@xmath2",
    "the series of @xmath11 resonances could be observed up to @xmath27 , while weaker resonances associated with @xmath28 excitations are barely measurable .",
    "only the @xmath29 resonances in the xe@xmath2 spectrum at energies below 685  ev could be measured . for xe@xmath0 and xe@xmath1 no data were taken at these energies .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : hires ] , the resonance positions shift towards higher energies as the charge state of the xenon ions is increased .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the binding of the electron is enhanced when successive outer electrons are removed from the xenon atom ( reduced screening ) .",
    "the measured resonance widths are significantly larger than the 160  mev experimental energy spread .",
    "these are mainly determined by the short lifetime of the @xmath3 hole which is rapidly filled by autoionizing transitions from higher atomic subshells . for neutral xenon",
    "the associated resonance width is @xmath30  ev @xcite , and this is consistent with the present observations , although a slight ( experimentally unresolved ) dependence on the charge state of the ions can be expected .",
    "in addition to the natural line width , there is also a resonance broadening due to the fine structure of the @xmath31 and @xmath32 hole - state configurations .",
    "some of the measured @xmath7 and @xmath8 resonance line shapes indicate an associated substructure . for higher @xmath5",
    "the fine - structure splitting becomes smaller than the natural line width such that individual resonance levels can not be resolved .",

    "in addition , a continuous cross section due to @xmath3 direct ionization ( di ) was modelled by an inverse tangent function .",
    "this simple approach neglects the fine - structure splitting of the threshold , nevertheless , it should be sufficiently accurate for the purpose of extracting resonance parameters from the experimental pi cross sections .",
    "the fitted di contribution and the sum of di and all resonances are shown as dashed and full lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : hires ] , respectively .",
    "the resonance energies obtained from the fit are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : res ] .    as mentioned above , two rydberg series of @xmath11 resonances can be clearly distinguished .",
    "they are associated with the two fine structure components of the @xmath3 hole .",
    "for each of these series , the resonance positions will approximately follow the simple rydberg formula @xmath53 with @xmath54 denoting the primary ion charge state .",
    "we have fitted this formula ( with @xmath55  ev ) to the experimental @xmath11 resonance positions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : serfit ] ) in order to extract the series limits @xmath45 and quantum defects @xmath44 as displayed in tab .",
    "[ tab : res ] .",
    "the quantum defects range from 0.8 to 1.0 and show that the @xmath56 holes increasingly overlap with the ( radial extent of the ) @xmath7 wave function as the charge state of the xenon ion increases .",
    "the series limits are in reasonable agreement with results from our atomic structure calculations ( see below ) .",
    "the series limits also coincide with the thresholds for @xmath3 di . indeed , the onsets of the di cross sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : hires ] ( dashed lines ) agree with the @xmath57 series limits as well as one might expect from the crude fit model for the di cross section . for each charge state",
    ", the difference between the @xmath58 and @xmath57 series limits corresponds to the fine - structure splitting of the @xmath3 hole .",
    "our analysis gives rise to the values of 12(2 ) , 13.6(4 ) , and 13.2(2 )  ev for xe@xmath0 , xe@xmath1 , and xe@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "these values agree with each other within the experimental uncertainties and are also close to the value of 12.7  ev for neutral xenon @xcite , indicating that the number of outer shell @xmath59 electrons does not have a strong influence on the structure of the @xmath3 shell .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath3 fine structure splitting , the formation of the @xmath11 rydberg shells is found to be much more strongly affected by the ion charge state .",
    "additional higher @xmath11 orbital functions seem to collapse into ( or , at least , towards ) the ionic core , i.e. , into the inner potential well .",
    "the resulting enlarged overlap of the @xmath11 with the @xmath3 wave functions also leads to enhanced probabilities for resonant @xmath60 excitations , as it is readily seen in the spectra of fig .  [",
    "fig : hires ] .",
    "indeed , @xmath11 resonances with increasingly higher @xmath5 occur as the ion charge increases .",
    "the above interpretation is supported by relativistic multiconfiguration dirac - fock ( mcdf ) calculations @xcite as is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : strength ] where we compare the calculated ( squared modulus of the ) electric - dipole matrix elements @xmath61 with the strengths of the experimentally observed resonances from the fits in fig .",
    "[ fig : hires ] .",
    "since the ( single - electron ) wave functions of the @xmath3 and @xmath11 electrons are orthogonal to each other , we have chosen the ( squared magnitude ) of the electric - dipole matrix elements as this best reflects the probability for a @xmath62 excitation and , hence , also the spatial overlap of these shells . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : strength ] , the electric - dipole matrix elements become larger with increasing charge and decrease for larger @xmath5 .",
    "we shall note , however , that the increase of the one - electron matrix elements reflects the overlap of the @xmath3 and @xmath11 orbitals and , hence , the contraction of the @xmath11 wave functions but does not tell much about the resonance strength as observed experimentally .",
    "the latter one depends on the many - electron ionization and subsequent decay amplitudes and is much more difficult to compute reliably ( cf .",
    "[ fig : xe5 ] ) .    to gain further insight into the formation of the resonances in fig .",
    "[ fig : hires ] , one needs to analyse the multiple auger deexcitation processes which follow the excitation or ionization of a @xmath3 electron .",
    "such a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "however , we can still compare the measured and calculated resonance structures by assuming that the branching ratio for triple ionization is the same for all resonances .",
    "this assumption appears to be well justified in view of a recent low - resolution study @xcite where cross sections , also for double and quadruple ionization , were measured and where the resonance structures in the different final channels were found to be similar to one another .",
    "moreover , we assume identical widths for all calculated resonances . thus , all these resonances were represented by a voigt line profile with a lorentzian width of 0.6  ev and a gaussian width of 0.16  ev .",
    "[ fig : xe5 ] compares the measured cross section with calculated data for the triple ionization of xe@xmath2 . to bring the theoretical data to the scale of experiment",
    ", we multiplied the theoretical ( absorption ) cross section by a ( global ) factor 0.3 .",
    "this factor corresponds to a 30% probability that xe@xmath63 ions are produced by the auger cascades that follow an initial @xmath60 excitation in the primary xe@xmath2 ion . in view of the crude assumptions made above",
    ", the agreement between the experimental and theoretical cross sections is quite satisfying .",
    "the largest deviation in the theoretical cross sections , when compared with experiment , occurs for the position of the @xmath64 resonances .",
    "it amounts to 2.8  ev and is in line with what we expect for a rather small - scale calculation as applied here to resonant photoionization of xe@xmath2 with its @xmath65 ground configuration . in these computations , only the ionization via the @xmath66 excitations was considered as these channels are the most important ones for the observed resonance structures .",
    "more extensive calculations employing large configuration expansions can be expected to substantially improve on the theoretical resonance energies , in particular , in the case of the @xmath67 resonances which are subject to comparatively strong correlation effects .",
    "such large scale calculations would also reduce the currently too large ( fine structure ) energy splittings within these groups of resonances .",
    "the calculations would also have to account for photoionization of ions in long - lived metastable levels which are expected to have been present in the xe@xmath12 ion beams @xcite .",
    "more experimentally observed details , such as the irregularly strong @xmath68 resonance strength in the triple ionization cross section of xe@xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hires ] ) , can be addressed only by means of large - scale calculations which fully account for the auger and radiative cascades following an initial @xmath3 excitation . until the present , however , such detailed computations of multiple cascades have been performed in some approximate manner only @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have measured absolute cross sections for the triple ionization of multiply charged xe@xmath0 , xe@xmath1 , and xe@xmath2 ions in the vicinity of the @xmath3 ionization threshold .",
    "the measured cross sections exhibit a threshold due to the direct @xmath3 ionization as well as strong resonances associated with @xmath60 excitations and their subsequent autoionization .",
    "the number of these resonances increases with the charge state of the initial ion .",
    "this nicely demonstrates the formation of the @xmath11 rydberg resonances or , loosely speaking , shows how the @xmath11 wave functions _ collapse _ into the ionic core as @xmath5 increases .",
    "this conclusion is supported also by our atomic structure calculations .",
    "the present photoionization measurements , therefore , visualize directly the transition from a dilute spectator density of excited electrons into a regular shell structure .",
    "this may affect our understanding of chemical binding from a non - covalent association of electrons to covalent bonds as well as the behaviour of quantum dots and nanostructures .",
    "quantum dots are often referred to as artificial atoms  and their excitation ( strength ) strongly depends on the size and shape of the associated shell structure @xcite , with applications in semiconductors , solar cells or quantum information @xcite .",
