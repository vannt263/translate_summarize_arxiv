    "observations of local milky way clouds show that the bulk of molecular gas is inert with star formation concentrated in the small fraction of the cloud at high surface density @xcite .",
    "this observation leads to the idea that the `` dense '' molecular gas ( @xmath2  mag , @xmath3 ) , rather than the whole molecular interstellar medium ( @xmath4  mag , @xmath5 ) , represents the star - forming phase .",
    "extragalactic scaling relations also support the idea that the amount of high density molecular gas helps to set the star formation rate .",
    "low angular resolution spectroscopy of nearby galaxies reveal a constant ratio ( within a factor of a few ) of hcn intensity , which traces the mass of dense gas , to infrared ( ir ) emission , which traces the rate of recent star formation , across a wide range of systems , including the central parts of nearby disks , starbursts , and major mergers .",
    "surprisingly , the hcn - to - ir ratios for whole galaxies are comparable to those in local cloud cores @xcite , implying a constant ratio of dense gas to star formation rate . the ratios of co intensity , which trace the overall molecular gas mass , to the ir emission , however , vary by more than a factor of ten between disk and starburst galaxies , suggesting that in extreme regions the relationship between the total molecular gas mass and the amount of star formation may be non - linear .    if the amount of dense gas is linked to the amount of star formation , then the formation of dense gas from more diffuse molecular gas represents an important regulating process .",
    "while there may be many regulating steps ( e.g. , the formation of giant molecular clouds out of diffuse hi , accretion onto the galaxy ) , differences among density probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of local clouds and the contrast between ulirgs , lirgs , and normal spirals support the idea that the ratio of dense to total molecular gas varies in different environments .",
    "this hypothesis can be tested in nearby galaxies by comparing dense gas , as traced by @xmath0  and @xmath1 , to the total molecular gas , as traced by co. while observations of nearby galaxies have lower spatial resolution and sensitivity than observations in the milky way , nearby galaxies probe a wider range of physical conditions than found in the solar neighborhood and more directly relate positions with environmental conditions .",
    "the main obstacle to pursuing systematic studies of the @xmath0-to - co ratio , or analogous measures of the dense gas fraction like the @xmath1-to - co ratio , has been the faintness of the line emission : averaged over a large part of a galaxy , the @xmath0  and @xmath1  lines are 1030 times fainter than @xmath6 @xcite . as a result",
    ", most studies of extragalactic dense gas with small - aperture millimeter - wave telescopes have focused on individual deep pointings rather than wide - field maps .",
    "the new @xmath7 mm ( `` w band '' ) heterodyne receiver on the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) has the potential to extend these single - pointing observations and map @xmath0  and @xmath1distributions in nearby galaxies because of the gbt s large collecting area , high surface accuracy , and good resolution .    in this letter",

    "the morphology of @xmath0  and @xmath1  emission follows the galaxy disk and coincides with the main ridge of @xmath12 emission and the star formation traced by the radio continuum emission ( top and middle panels of figure  [ fig : m82_overview_figure ] ) .",

    "emission from @xmath0  and @xmath1  has also been associated with the agn - driven outflow in the ulirg mrk 231 . to our knowledge , the current observations",
    ", however , would be the first time that dense molecular gas , as traced by @xmath1 , has been found to be associated with a starburst - driven outflow in a nearby galaxy .",
    "the outflow of dense molecular gas seen in @xmath1  may regulate star formation in galaxies like m82 by removing the fuel for star formation .",
    "the disk - averaged line profiles of the @xmath0  and @xmath1  emission agree with @xmath11 emission from the heracles image ( leroy et al .",

    "the models of the @xmath6 emission from show that the different co transitions reflect different molecular gas densities . transitions like @xmath32 are emitted by relatively diffuse ( @xmath33 ) molecular gas associated with the disk , while the higher order @xmath6 transitions ( @xmath34 ) are emitted by two denser components ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) associated with the star - forming gas .",
    "inspection of the channel maps near 220  @xmath26  confirm that the lack of structure in the @xmath11 is due to the presence of a significant amount of co emission associated with the warm and diffuse molecular gas found throughout the disk , while the @xmath0  and @xmath1  trace the denser molecular gas component found in the torus .",

    ", the distributions of all three ratios have the same range as the points from the literature , although @xmath38  and @xmath39  do peak at lower values .",
    "however , we must be cautious because we are comparing measurements of entire galaxies with spatially resolved measurements within a galaxy . because the co emission has a larger filling factor than the hcn emission , the unresolved measurements may have systematically larger @xmath38  and @xmath39  ratios .",
    "the @xmath38and @xmath40  values for m82 as a whole are similar to the mode of the values found for other galaxies , while the @xmath39  value is slightly lower .",
    "the @xmath38  and @xmath39  values increase with distance from the center of the galaxy ( bottom panels of figure  [ fig : l_hcn_hcop_ratio ] ) , suggesting the fraction of dense gas decreases with distance from the center .",
    "the @xmath40  ratio is roughly constant across the center of the galaxy with higher values at the southern edge .",
    "figure  [ fig : gao_and_solomon ] compares the relationship between the total molecular gas mass ( @xmath41 ) , the dense gas mass ( @xmath42  and @xmath43 ) , and the star formation rate ( @xmath44 ) for the entire m82 disk , points within m82 , the sample of galaxies from the literature used in figure  [ fig : l_hcn_hcop_ratio ] , and star - forming regions in the milky way @xcite .",
    "we have estimated @xmath44  for the m82 points by multiplying the 3.0  ghz continuum flux density per pixel by the ratio of the infrared luminosity to the 3  ghz flux density for the entire galaxy . in effect , this procedure relies on the radio - infrared correlation , one of the tightest astronomical correlations , but avoids additional systematic errors by using the empirical ratio rather than a fit to the correlation seen in a large sample of galaxies .",
    "the use of the 3  ghz radio continuum ameliorates the significant optical depth effects found in edge - on galaxies like m82 .    for the entire m82 disk ,",
    "the relationship between the @xmath44  and @xmath42values matches the trend between @xmath44  and @xmath42  found for a sample of lirgs and ulirgs , which have high star formation rates .",
    "however , our data shows that the relationship between @xmath44  and @xmath42  varies _ within m82_. regions away from the central starburst tend to have lower @xmath44  ( star formation rate ) for a given amount of @xmath42  ( dense molecular gas ) .",
    "these points match the trend seen in normal galaxies @xcite and individual star - forming regions in the milky way @xcite . for points near the central starburst ,",
    "the @xmath44  ( star formation rate ) is higher for a given amount of @xmath42  ( dense molecular gas ) , matching the trend seen for lirg / ulirgs .",
    "we see a similar trend for the @xmath1measurements .",
    "compared to normal galaxies , individual regions in m82 tend to have higher dense gas fractions ( @xmath45  or @xmath46 ) and higher ratios of star formation to total molecular gas mass ( @xmath47 ) , but the dense gas fractions vary by a factor of 10 .",
    "these resolved observations of m82 show that the relationship between the amount of dense gas and star formation rate ( as traced by the radio continuum ) varies within a single galaxy .",
    "the key variable appears to be the central starburst , which could be using up or expelling the dense gas , affecting the gas tracer chemistry , and/or changing how star formation proceeds .",
    "future resolved observations of @xmath0  and @xmath1  in star - forming regions in a variety of galactic environments will allow us to disentangle these possibilities and understand how the central starburst in m82 influences star formation .",
    "we have made the most sensitive map to date of the dense molecular gas in the starburst galaxy m82 using the largest single - dish millimeter - wave telescope in the world : the gbt .",
    "the @xmath0  and @xmath1emission correlates with lower density molecular gas , traced by co , and star formation , traced by radio continuum , and its kinematics are consistent with the previously proposed torus of molecular gas .",
    "we also detect low surface brightness @xmath1  emission coincident with the base of the molecular gas outflow first detected in @xmath6 and tracing the edge of the hot outflowing gas seen in the x - ray .",
    "the @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40  ratios are similar to those in other starburst galaxies .",
    "the first two ratios increase with distance from the central starburst , implying that the fraction of dense gas decreases with distance from the starburst .",
    "the relationship between the dense molecular gas and star formation varies with distance from the central starburst .",
    "near its center , there is a higher ratio of star formation to dense molecular gas , similar to the relationship seen for lirgs and ulirgs , but outside of the central starburst , the ratio of the star formation to dense molecular gas decreases , agreeing with the correlation seen in normal galaxies and the milky way .",
    "these observations demonstrate the effectiveness of the gbt for mapping dense molecular gas in external galaxies .",
