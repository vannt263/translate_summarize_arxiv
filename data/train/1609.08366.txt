    "the investigation of ionospheric effects caused by the earth s surface sources is a traditional and effective technique for studies of neutral - ionospheric interaction .",
    "a lot of papers are devoted to theoretical and experimental aspects of the problem @xcite .",
    "one of such phenomena is generation of midscale ionospheric irregularities directly by shock wave from the supersonic seismic source propagating over the surface @xcite .    to estimate the seismic disturbance efficiency to the ionosphere",
    "is the essential problem for planning and interpretation of each single experiment .",
    "the effective generation of intrinsic gravity waves ( igw ) in the vicinity of the epicenter according to gps - data requires large enough earthquake magnitude @xcite .",
    "but there are no statistical information about the boundary values for the intensity of seismic ( rayleigh ) waves that produce the vertical midscale ionospheric structures ( multicusp ) .    for the study of the multicusp the vertical ionosondes",
    "are widely used @xcite .",
    "the use of chirp ionosondes for this problem significantly increases the signal - to - noise ratio and improves the temporal and spatial resolution , which are the key parameters for such studies .",
    "the efficiency of replacement of the pulse ionosondes by chirp ionosondes for diagnosis of ionospheric profile was demonstrated , for example in @xcite .",
    "baikal region is a seismically active area , so studies of seismic activity effects are constantly being conducted . a number of various ionospheric , optical , magnetic , seismic and acoustic instruments are involved into monitoring and case - study tasks @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is a preliminary statistical analysis of the emergence of midscale vertical ionospheric irregularities caused by large earthquakes at a large distance from the epicenter and investigating the effectiveness of this mechanism . in order to complete this",
    ", we used the 2011 - 2016 data from the irkutsk fast monostatic chirp ionosonde ( ifmci ) .",
    "we also used a variety of gps - receivers in the areas near the epicenters of the earthquakes to compare near zone and far zone ionospheric effects .",
    "ifmci ( 51.81n , 103.078e ) started its continuous operation in 2012 , 150 km to the south - west from irkutsk .",
    "for operation it uses a continuous chirp - signal with a frequency range from 1.5 mhz to 15 mhz and 10watts of transmitted power@xcite .",
    "the spacing between the receiving and transmitting antenna is approximately 150 meters .",
    "low power and minimal spacing between antennas allows transmitter and receiver to operate at the same time .",
    "the use of modern technologies of digital reception allows us to reach a high flexibility in the use of equipment and get a wide dynamic range .",
    "the fully digital structure of the ionosonde allows us to precisely control the shape of the transmitted signal as well as the impulse response and filtering characteristics of the receivers @xcite .",
    "we develop and use original techniques for filtering out the signals from neighbor public radiostations and significantly improve the quality of the ionosonde data @xcite .",
    "the typical frequency sweep speed is about 500 khz / s , providing 27 second time resolution . from the beginning of its continuous operation in 2012",
    "the ionosonde uses 1-minute time resolution typical for modern monitoring techniques @xcite .",
    "this allows us to use its data for detailed study of vertical ionospheric disturbances generated by seismic waves .      for analysis of seismic variations",
    "we use the data from `` talaya '' seismic station ( tly , 51.681n,103.644e , @xcite ) .",
    "the station is located near the point of ionospheric sounding , and both of them are marked at fig.[fig:1]a by single vertical cross . for analysis of the results presented in other publications , we used the data from seismic stations aru ( 56.429n , 58.561e , @xcite ) , nkc ( 50.233n , 12.448e,@xcite ) and tato ( 24.973n , 121.497e , @xcite ) , also located near the points of corresponding ionospheric observations .",
    "strong earthquakes at large distances from the epicenter sometimes produce in the ionosphere vertical midscale irregularities ( multicusp ) @xcite .",
    "their generation is associated with the passage of supersonic surface ( rayleigh ) seismic waves below the point of ionospheric sounding @xcite , and with propagation of resulting acoustic shock wave in the atmosphere and ionosphere .",
    "the amplitude of the effect is determined by the amplitude of the source seismic vibrations . so selecting the earthquakes that produce the effect over their magnitude , the distance to them , or other parameters of the earthquake related to epicenter is not optimal .",
    "to select the earthquakes participating in the study , we analyzed the amplitude of the seismic vibrations near the point of ionospheric observations .",
    "we estimated the equivalent class @xmath2 of the earthquake seismic vibrations by representing the observed vertical seismic amplitude in logarithmic scale .",
    "this gives us a rough estimation of the amplitude of the source of the shock wave in the ionosphere at large distances from the epicenter .",
    "the @xmath2 is :    @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the amplitude of the vertical seismic oscillations ( in nanometers ) , calculated as the median over 4 seconds to remove noise .",
    "table[tab:1 ] shows the list of detected at tly station large seismic disturbances with @xmath5 , that were analyzed in the paper , and corresponding earthquakes .",
    "[ fig:1]a shows the geometry of investigated earthquakes , marked by circles with radius proportional to their @xmath2 , measured at tly station .",
    "as one can see , the earthquakes at larger distances appear with a smaller @xmath2 , than the earthquakes at smaller distances from seismic station .",
    "this illustrates the local character of the @xmath2 class , related with not only the earthquake magnitude , but with the relative position of the epicenter and seismic station also .",
    "investigation of the ionospheric total electron content variations ( tec ) in the vicinity of the earthquake epicenters was made on the basis of phase measurements at dual frequency gps receivers .",
    "for every given earthquake epicenter the data from nearby gps - stations from international hemodynamic network igs ( http://sopac.ucsd.edu ) were used for this study .",
    "tec variations were calculated by the standard technique used to study the earthquake effects @xcite . in accordance with generally accepted standards , we relate the measured tec with the ionospheric point , i.e. with the point of intersection of the ray `` satellite - receiver '' with equivalent ionospheric layer at the height of maximal electron density @xmath6 @xcite . in our research",
    "we used typical @xmath7 .",
    "we filtered the initial tec series to get the variations with periods ranging from 2 to 10 minutes , typically intensified by earthquakes in the vicinity of the epicenter @xcite and related with the midscale ionospheric disturbances caused by earthquakes .    to make more accurate comparison of the intensity of ionospheric disturbances at different stations we transform the inclined tec variations into equivalent vertical tec variations @xcite .",
    "to differ earthquake effects from regular one we compared the tec variations at the day of the earthquake with tec variations in previous and subsequent days , following to traditional approach @xcite .",
    "one of the effects observed after a powerful earthquake is multicusp in the ionosphere , associated with the passage of powerful shock wave ( mach cone ) from supersonic surface seismic waves ( rayleigh waves ) .",
    "the propagation of shock wave in the neutral atmosphere generates similar irregularities in the ionosphere through the neutral - ion collisions ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "these ionospheric irregularities can be detected by vertical ionosondes , in a form of very specific , short - lived disturbances at the ionograms .",
    "this phenomenon was clearly observed after the tohoku earthquake 11/03/2011 @xcite and after chile earthquake 27/02/2010 @xcite .",
    "usually this effect is very fast : its total duration is associated with the passage of the surface seismic waves , and usually do not exceed several minutes .",
    "therefore , for its diagnosis one needs the ionospheric instruments with temporal resolution better than 1 minute - a network of gps - receivers or fast ionosondes .",
    "the weakness of the effect even after strong earthquakes makes possible their observation with gps in either case of the most powerful earthquakes ( when disturbances in the total electron content are significant ) , or with large spatial networks of gps - receivers using special processing and accumulation techniques presented , for example , in @xcite .    in comparison with gps - receiver , covering huge spatial area and allowing us to investigate mostly horizontal structure of the irregularities",
    ", the ionosonde usually investigates ionosphere above its location .",
    "ionosondes are more sensitive instruments for investigating the midscale vertical irregularities , and , thus , they are more useful than gps for analysis of vertical ionospheric disturbances after weaker earthquakes or effects at larger distances from the epicenter .",
    "the only drawback of ionosondes is their poor temporal resolution of the order of 10 - 15 minutes intended mainly for the diagnosis of secondary ionospheric parameters - the behavior of critical frequencies and the height of the maximum .",
    "ionosondes with a higher temporal resolution were suggested and used for case studies a long time ago @xcite , but for regular studies they appeared quite recently @xcite .",
    "ifmci has the necessary temporal resolution @xcite and works in 1 minute mode constantly - since 2012 , and selectively - since 2011 .",
    "this allowed us to accumulate a huge statistics for monitoring of ionospheric perturbations associated with earthquakes in this period .",
    "fig.[fig:2 ] shows an example of the dynamics of vertical ionospheric disturbances ( multicusp ) at irkutsk ionosonde data during deep okhotsk sea earthquake ( 24/05/2013 ) , rarely discussed in the literature .",
    "the most significant multicusp effect is observed up to 300 km effective height during 06:02 - 06:06ut .",
    "as one can see , the effect duration is about several minutes .",
    "this makes it difficult for detection by standard 15-minute ionosondes .",
    "the effect is observed about 7 - 10 minutes after the moment of maximal seismic vertical variation .",
    "this delay is related with propagation of acoustic signal from the ground to these heights , and explains well experimental observations @xcite .    to analyze seismic effects in the ionosphere we analyzed the ionogrames in the period @xmath8 from the beginning(end ) of most powerful seismic disturbances during the investigated period .",
    "the ionograms related to each seismic disturbance are shown in support materials . as a result",
    ", we found that the multicusp effect of earthquakes at ifmci data was observed during the following earthquakes : 11/03/2011 ( mw9.0 tohoku , japan ) , 26/02/2012 ( mw6.6 southwestern siberia , russia ) , 11/04/2012 ( mw8.4 northen sumatra ) , 11/04/2012 ( mw8.0 northen sumatra ) , 24/05/2013 ( mw8.3 okhotsk sea ) , 26/04/2015 ( mw6.7 nepal ) , 12/05/2015 ( mw7.3 nepal ) , 17/09/2015 ( mw8.3 coquimbo , chile ) , 25/04/2015 ( mw7.8 nepal ) .",
    "fig.[fig:3 ] shows the most revealing ionograms during these earthquakes .    from fig.[fig:3 ] one can see that sometimes the multicusp effect is also accompanied by distortion and bifurcation of the f - track ( fig.[fig:3]h2 ) , that can be interpreted as horizontal irregularities .",
    "more detailed ionogram dynamics for each earthquake response can also be found in the support information .",
    "as it is shown by @xcite , even for a powerful tohoku 11/03/2011 earthquake the specific periods of perturbation and their amplitude can be evaluated under assumption of the monotony of the perturbed electron density profile . therefore , to evaluate the perturbation amplitude we processed the ionograms by standard polan program ( available at @xcite ) , which is traditionally used for multicusp analysis @xcite .    for automatic processing of the data we developed a simple program",
    "set used to convert ionogrames into profiles of plasma frequency .",
    "the automatic processing was easy to be done due to high quality of irkutsk ionogrames , already filtered out from neighboring public radiostations by original and very powerful technique @xcite .",
    "the algorithm for obtaining electron density profiles from ionograms consists of 3 stages . at the 1st stage ,",
    "the ionogram is filtered out from rare dot - like noise of different nature . at the 2nd stage",
    ", the track is made over the data by dividing the frequency interval of significant signals into 50 subintervals , that is necessary for stable work of polan program . in each subinterval",
    "we find the median point over the height and frequency . at the 3rd stage the median points , collected over subintervals",
    "forms the 50-points track , are used as a source for polan calculations of plasma frequency profile .",
    "some results of this automatic processing are shown in fig.[fig:3b ] . in the figure",
    "the plasma frequency profiles are shown , and their differential over the frequency . from fig.[fig:3b ] one can see that the main perturbations associated with multicusp can be observed from 140 km up to f2 maximum ( for example , fig.[fig:3b]a ) , so for their observations the ionosonde must operate in the appropriate mode , covering reflection heights from 100 - 140 km to f2 maximum .",
    "as one can see , the surface seismic waves lead to formation of mid - scale short - lived plasma frequency variations that disturb initial , relatively smooth ionospheric profile .",
    "the amplitude of these effects is relatively small , and more evident at ionograms ( that non - lineary depends on the plasma frequency profile ) , than in the plasma profile itself .",
    "another effect , that accompanied some of the earthquakes , was the change of sporadic e - layer structure , manifested in the form of bifurcation after the passage of the surface wave .",
    "fig.[fig:4 ] shows an example of this effect for the earthquake 07/12/2015 ( mw7.2 tajikistan ) .",
    "fig.[fig:5]a - c , e - g , i - k show the most characteristic ionograms for the earthquakes 25/10/2013 ( mw7.1 off east coast of honshu , japan ) , 16/02/2015 ( mw6.8 near east coast of honshu , japan ) , 07/12/2015 ( mw7.2 tajikistan ) .    to emphasize this effect , we integrated amplitude at ionograms over frequency for each given effective height .",
    "this technique is close to the height - time - intensity(hti ) technique @xcite .",
    "dependence of the resulting amplitude on the effective height for different earthquakes ( when we observe this effect ) is shown in fig.[fig:5]d , h , l .",
    "the figure shows that the main effect is the appearance of an additional e - sporadic layer overlying the usual e - sporadic layer on the ionogram .",
    "it arises approximately 10 - 15 minutes after the passage of seismic disturbance at the point of observation and lasts about 20 minutes . after arising",
    ", the secondary reflection gradually decreases down to the height of the main e - sporadic track . at the same time with a decrease of the reflected signal height its amplitude is increased .",
    "examples of tec variations in the vicinity of the epicenters of all considered earthquakes ( table [ tab:2 ] ) are shown in fig.[fig:6 ] .",
    "we selected the pairs `` satellite - receiver '' with rays closest to the earthquake s epicenter and with larger tec effect ( to take into account aspect dependence of tec effects ) .",
    "the tec variations at those rays are shown in fig.[fig:6 ] .    to estimate the efficiency of each earthquake for generating 2 - 10min tec variations",
    ", we made a preliminary analysis of all the gps data at the nearest gps - stations .",
    "the results of the analysis are summarized in table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "the table also shows the local solar time of the main shock in the epicenter of the earthquake ( `` lst '' ) , the focal mechanism of the earthquake ( `` fault type '' ) and background geomagnetic conditions on the day of the earthquake ( `` m.disturbance '' ) .",
    "the information about focal mechanisms of the earthquake is obtained from the the global cmt project(http://www.globalcmt.org ) .",
    "the geomagnetic conditions are estimated from dst and ae indexes , obtained from the international data centre in kyoto ( http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/wdc ) . in the table",
    "we mark the days with disturbed geomagnetic conditions ( `` disturbed '' ) and with magnetic storms ( @xmath9 , `` storm '' ) , based on the behavior of these indexes .    from the table [ tab:2 ]",
    "one can see that during most part of the earthquakes the geomagnetic conditions were quiet .",
    "so ionospheric irregularities related with geomagnetic disturbances has not prevent us to detect tec - gps response to earthquakes .",
    "we classify tec disturbances generated by the earthquakes into 3 following categories .",
    "`` strong response '' has relatively high amplitude ( @xmath10 tecu ) ( fig.[fig:6]a , l , m , n , p ) and recorded at many rays `` receiver - satellite '' .",
    "such responses are registered after five earthquakes : 11/03/2011 , 25/04/2015 , 26/04/2015 , 12/05/2015 , 16/09/2015 .",
    "the magnitude of these earthquakes varies from 6.7 to 9.0 , and all of them had reverse fault focal mechanism .",
    "it is important to note about very successful geometry of the measurements during all of these earthquakes : the most part of the `` receiver - satellite '' rays were close to or directly above the epicenter .    in this category",
    "the most powerful earthquake 11/03/2011 ( tohoku , japan ) should be emphasized .",
    "it causes the most intense and prolonged ionospheric disturbances .",
    "ionospheric effects of this earthquake are investigated in a huge amount of papers ( see for example @xcite ) . recently",
    ", more attention is paid to modeling of these effects @xcite and to the study of the propagation of the disturbances at large distances @xcite .",
    "`` weak response '' is the response that has relatively low amplitude ( 0.1 - 0.15 tecu ) and recorded at several ( 2 to 5 ) rays satellite - receiver. the shape and amplitude of such disturbances is high enough to detect it from the background tec variations level .    in this category",
    "the deep earthquake 24/05/2013(okhotsk sea earthquake , fig.[fig:6]e ) should be emphasized .",
    "it was very powerful earthquake ( mw8.3 ) with a predominance of vertical displacements in the epicenter ( normal fault ) .",
    "it attracted the attention of seismologists , because felt at unusually large ( 10,000 km ) distance from the epicenter @xcite .",
    "the earth s surface displacement in the sea of okhotsk area caused by this earthquake were also studied using gps - data @xcite . however , due to the very large depth of the epicenter , the impact of the okhotsk sea earthquake to the ionosphere looks very weak .",
    "perhaps that is why the ionospheric effects of the earthquake were not discussed too much in the literature .",
    "we could not find any work devoted to the gps - tec or ionospheric perturbations caused by this event on nearby region . during the present study we detected some tec perturbations , most likely associated with the okhotsk sea earthquake , but only at two rays ( mag0-g06 , mag0-g16 ) , closest to the epicenter of the earthquake .",
    "`` no response '' category in the table [ tab:2 ] means that we were unable to identify any significant tec disturbances related to the earthquake at any of the rays `` receiver - satellite '' ( fig.[fig:6 ] b , c ) .",
    "the effects were not observed after two earthquakes : 14/02/2013 and 16/04/2013 . in our opinion",
    "the disturbance observed in 14/02/2013 ( fig.[fig:6]b ) is not a response to the earthquake , but should be associated with the intersection by the ray `` receiver - satellite '' by the sharp electron density gradient , perhaps the highlatitude trough .",
    "the analysis of the original ( unfiltered ) series of tec variations leads us to this conclusion .",
    "as the analysis has shown , the series have a bend ( `` hook '' ) , which is a characteristic for the cases when the beam crosses the steep gradient of the electron density , for example , the terminator or boundary of ionospheric trough . to `` no response '' category we also attributed the events when we detect a weak perturbations at one or two rays with the shape close to the shape associated with earthquake - generated perturbations usually @xcite ( fig.[fig:6 ] d , k ) .",
    "however , due to a number of reasons ( the absence of such disturbances on the other rays , a significant propagation velocity exceeding sound speed , etc . )",
    "there is no assurance that these perturbations can be caused by an earthquake ( for example , in case of 20/04/2013 and 20/04/2015 ) .",
    "no gps - tec response to the earthquake may have several causes .",
    "first of all , the earthquakes with small magnitude and with predominance of horizontal displacement in the focus ( strike - slip faults ) that produce very small effects with amplitudes lower than background effects . as it was shown in @xcite , after the earthquakes with magnitudes @xmath11 appreciable tec wave - like disturbances are not observed , and in the case of strong earthquakes ( @xmath12 ) responses are more pronounced after the events with substantial vertical component in the focus ( normal or reverse fault ) .",
    "another important cause is the geometry of gps - measurements . in most cases ,",
    "the lack of response at the beam path `` receiver - satellite '' may be related with a large distance from the ionospheric point to the epicenter ( the mark `` rays far away '' in table [ tab:2 ] ) .    for `` strong response '' and `` weak response '' categories we estimated the propagation velocity of disturbances .",
    "the estimate is done for the first impulse response .",
    "the velocity @xmath13 is calculated from a simple linear propagation model @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the line - of - sight distance between the epicenter and the ionospheric point at which the response was recorded , @xmath16 is the delay between the tec variation maximum moment and the moment of the earthquake ( shown in table[tab:2 ] ) .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath13 are summarized in table [ tab:2 ] .",
    "the calculated propagation velocity varies between 150 and 600 m / s .",
    "this indicates that these perturbations can be associated with propagation of internal atmospheric waves @xcite .",
    "as the analysis of gps - tec measurements shows above , near the epicenter the most part of earthquakes were accompanied by tec - variations ( see fig.[fig:7]a ) . from the other side , the multicusp effect at large distances",
    "accompanies only several earthquakes .",
    "so the question naturally arises , how can we estimate the effectiveness of a given surface seismic wave for the formation of those or other effects in the ionosphere . to estimate this",
    ", we introduce the class of rayleigh wave acoustical efficiency ( rwaec ) that is determined by the amplitude of the local seismic vibrations below the point of ionospheric observations .",
    "it can be shown that for distributed acoustic wave source the mach cone amplitude @xmath17 can be estimated by multiplying mach cone amplitude from moving point source to the acoustic radiation pattern of distributed source : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the amplitude of acoustic signal in the shock wave , generated by dot - like ( isotropic ) acoustic source moving with supersonic speed ; @xmath20 is the acoustic radiation pattern of the distributed source itself as a function of zenith angle @xmath21 , calculated from relation between sound speed @xmath22 and supersonic source speed @xmath23 ( supposed to be 3.5km / s ) .",
    "the radiation pattern @xmath20 is defined by the spatial structure of the propagating seismic wave .",
    "this approximation does not take into account the phase radiation pattern .",
    "the exact spatial wave structure is unknown for us , but we can assume that the wave has some spatial shape , that moves without dispersion with the supersonic speed of seismic wave .",
    "based on this approximation we can use temporal variations of the seismic signal at a given station to estimate the spatial shape of an equivalent acoustic source . in this case",
    "we can calculate the radiation pattern associated with the spatial distribution of seismic oscillations , and estimate the amplification of the mach cone as a function of seismic signal shape .",
    "it should be noted that since the seismic wave velocity is much higher than acoustic sound speed in the atmosphere , one needs to take into account the radiation pattern only at the angles close to the perpendicular to the earth s surface ( i.e. perpendicular to the radiation plane ) .",
    "the principle of the formation of a mach cone with taking into account the acoustic signal radiation pattern is illustrated in fig.[fig:7]b .",
    "the intensity of the acoustic signal in the far zone of the acoustic antenna ( that is approximately valid for this case ) is defined by radiation pattern . the radiation pattern @xmath24 of distributed sound source in its far field zone",
    "is defined @xcite as :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is vibrational velocity of the sound source ( we suppose the movements to be strictly vertical ) . in one - dimensional , steady - state case , we can estimate the vertical velocity of the surface oscillations from the experimental data as    @xmath27    in this case , the wave vector of the radiation @xmath28 is close to the perpendicular to the plane of the source @xmath29 and their scalar product is small . in the one - dimensional case , for plain earth approximation , along the direction of the rayleigh wave motion ( this case corresponds to a significant distance between observation point and the epicenter of the earthquake , when the seismic wave can be considered having not spherical but plane front ) , the acoustic radiation pattern can be estimated from one - dimensional spectrum :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is a wavenumber projection to the acoustic source plane .",
    "fig.[fig:7]c shows examples of radiation pattern , calculated for tohoku ( 11/03/2013 ) earthquake for two wavelengths - @xmath32 ( black line ) and @xmath33 ( red line ) , as a function of zenith angle .",
    "the dashed line marks the direction of shockwave propagation . as one can see , the antenna pattern is different for different wavelengths .",
    "so we can find the wavelength , for which the amplitude of acoustical signal becomes maximal in shockwave direction .",
    "the amplitude corresponds to the maximum of the spectrum ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) .",
    "so searching the wavelength most effective for generating acoustical signal in the first approximation corresponds to the search of maximum in the spectrum ( [ eq : spectrum ] ) .    thus , for fixed height of the expected effect @xmath34 and excluding the effects of the sound propagation in the neutral atmosphere and the energy transformation from the neutral component to the charged one , the spectral energy class of the acoustic signal caused by seismic vibrations can be estimated from the maximal amplitude of radiation pattern , and consequently from the spectrum of the derivative of seismic vibrations like :    @xmath35    where @xmath4 in nanometers . for calculating the spectrum in ( [ eq",
    ": kw ] ) we used 8192 and 16384 point fast fourier transform .",
    "fig.[fig:7]d shows a comparative analysis of the spectra of the derivative of the vertical vibrations during several earthquakes ( 11/03/2011 , 24/05/2013 and 12/05/2015 ) that are close in irkutsk local solar time , as well as close in season .",
    "one can see that the spectra ( and acoustic radiation patterns ) differs significantly , and this can explain the difference in the amplitude of the effect , observed in the ionosphere .",
    "the fig.[fig:7]e and table [ tab:3 ] summarize the main effects of earthquakes observed by ifmci as a function of local solar time and rayleigh wave acoustic efficiency class @xmath0 .",
    "one can see from the fig.[fig:7]e that at night multicusp effect is not observed .",
    "this can be due to the fact that for nighttime low electron density the standard ionograms start from 250 km altitude .",
    "for relatively weak @xmath36 multicusp is not observed even in the daytime .",
    "for relatively high @xmath37 multicusp is observed nearly regularly at daytime [ 07:00 - 17:00]lst .",
    "it should be noted that at the 16:00 and 01:00 lst multicusp is not observed , although tracks observed at ionograms allow us to detect such effect .",
    "we can make a conclusion that to observe multicusp in the f - layer is too difficult at night .",
    "this can be explained qualitatively by the need of more energy for seismic oscillations at nighttime to generate waves in high f - layer than at daytime to generate the effects in the lower f1 or e - layer .",
    "this is due to the fact that lower electron density produces less neutral - electron collisions , that are the main agents for energy transfer from neutral acoustic wave to electron density variations @xcite .",
    "to verify our conclusions about the power and daily features of multicusp observations we also analyzed the results from some of the most detailed papers .",
    "in particular , we calculated @xmath0 index for the observations of ionospheric multicusp reported in ( @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation of @xmath0 was made from the seismic vibrations observed at seismic stations nearby the locations of observed ionospheric effects ( the aru seismic station ( sverdlovsk region , russia ) , tato seismic station ( taiwan ) and nkc seismic station(czech republic ) ) .",
    "the results are also summarized in the table [ tab:3 ] and fig.[fig:7]e .",
    "these cases are marked by asterisks and confirm the obtained results .",
    "in the morning , evening and night time ( lst @xmath38 15:00,lst @xmath39 07:00 ) we observed cases of bifurcation effect in the sporadic e - layer .",
    "this track separation can be explained by the formation of an additional horizontal layer above the regular sporadic - e that causes the appearance of an additional reflection point .",
    "one can assume several variants of how to explain the observed bifurcation effect in the sporadic e - layer .",
    "we assume that we observe a downward movement of irregularities due to translucency of sporadic e - layer , by analogy with @xcite . in this case",
    ", the downward movement occurs with nearly wind speeds .",
    "the presented observations of gps - tec disturbances in the vicinity of earthquake epicenters confirm the data obtained in previous studies @xcite . with the increasing of the earthquake magnitude , in general , an increase in tec amplitude perturbations",
    "is observed as well .",
    "the tec response is also affected by the mechanism of the earthquake source : after the earthquake , in the epicenter of which a vertical displacements are dominated , the tec variations are intensified and are detected at a large number of rays `` satellite - receiver '' .",
    "the geometry of measurements also plays an important role : the absence of rays `` satellite - receiver '' near the epicenter makes it difficult to detect responses even after earthquakes with magnitudes mw@xmath387 .",
    "it may also be noted that after strong earthquakes ( mw@xmath388 ) , in addition to the first pulse associated with the main shock , a number of secondary vibrations is observed .",
    "they are caused , in our opinion , by the generation of eigen oscillations of the atmosphere with different periods ( igws ) @xcite .",
    "the dependence of tec effects on the local time has not been identified ( see table[tab:2 ] ) .",
    "the diurnal variation of effects suggests that generation of igws more likely do not depend on the local time .",
    "the dependence of intensity of igws effects on the nature of earthquakes was discussed , for example , in @xcite .",
    "this means that the found dependence of multicusp from the local time that is not detected in the epicenter vicinity .",
    "it significantly depends on the specific mechanism of multicusp generation by the shock wave .",
    "this can be qualitatively explained by the dependence of the ion - neutral collisions mechanism on the product of the background neutral density and background electron density , that is maximal in a daytime .",
    "in the paper the statistical analysis of ionospheric effects of earthquakes that occured in 2011 - 2016 according to the irkutsk fast monostatic chirp ionosonde was made . to control the process of neutral - ionospheric interaction in the vicinity of epicenter",
    "the data from gps - receivers were also analyzed for each of these earthquakes .    to estimate the ionospheric efficiency class for seismic disturbances in the far field of epicenter , that cause propagation of the shock cone ( mach cone ) we proposed the logarithmic index @xmath0 ( [ eq : kw ] ) , based on finding the maximal amplitude of spectral power fluctuations . from a physical point of view",
    ", the index allows us to estimate the maximal amplitude of the shock wave ( mach cone ) based on spatial distribution of seismic oscillations and their vertical velocities .",
    "so the index depends on the amplitude of the acoustic effects associated with the passage of seismic surface wave .",
    "the analysis shows that the characteristic index value , from which ifmci can see multicusp effect in the ionosphere ( at daytime [ 7:00 - 17:00]lst @xmath40 ) .",
    "the bifurcation of sporadic e - layer can be observed at nighttime at @xmath41 .",
    "it is shown that a multicusp effect according ifmci data has a rather pronounced daily dependence , intensified in local daytime hours , with absence of characteristic dependence on fof2 .",
    "this allows us to suggest that the possibility of observing the effect is likely due not to the intensity of the primary f2 layer , but due to other mechanisms at lower heights .",
    "it is shown that when ionograms start above 250 km ( in the morning , evening and night ) the multicusp effect in irkutsk is not observed , this corresponds well with results of @xcite .",
    "it is shown that this effect is not associated with daily dependence of the generation of ionospheric disturbances in the vicinity of the earthquake epicenter , estimated by gps data .",
    "this suggests that the efficiency of generation of irregularities on the mach shock wave and in the vicinity of earthquake epicenter are apparently different .    on the example of deep earthquake in the okhotsk sea ( 25/10/2013 ,",
    "depth about 600 km ) it can be assumed that the effects of rayleigh wave in the case of deep earthquakes may be more noticeable than igw effects in the vicinity of earthquake epicenter .",
    "thus , in spite of the daily dependency effects , the effects from rayleigh waves are an additional way to study the ionospheric response to earthquakes , because they can sometimes produce more strong effects than igws generated in the epicenter .    it is shown that after passing the rayleigh wave sometimes can be observed a bifurcation in sporadic e - layer , observed as secondary e - layer arised and moving downward to basic sporadic e. this can be associated with formation of vertical irregularities and their dynamics under the influence of the dynamics of the neutral atmosphere .    as a result of the work it is shown that fast ifmci is a very sensitive instrument for investigating of rapid ionospheric effects related to the earthquakes with @xmath42 during the day , which roughly corresponds to the characteristic magnitudes of distant earthquakes above @xmath43 .",
    "this makes the ionosonde a convenient tool for the diagnosis of various processes that occur during seismo- ionospheric interaction .",
    "the obtained results allow us to suggest @xmath44 and local solar time as effective parameters for searching the multicusp effects in the ionosphere related with surface seismic waves .",
