    "shallow donors p , as and bi in silicon have been studied extensively since the pioneering experiments of feher @xcite .",
    "a revived interest to these systems has been raised by a recent proposal of using donor spins as qubits for quantum computing @xcite . a long coherence time and ease of qubit initialization by external microwave fields",
    "are necessary conditions for building a quantum computer .",
    "these properties , also known as long transversal relaxation time and fast dynamic nuclear polarization , are inherent features of p impurities in si ( si : p ) at cryogenic temperatures . in this work",
    "we will concern the dynamic nuclear polarization and relaxation of p donors in silicon at low temperatures and high magnetic fields , when their electron spins are polarized to a very high degree , while the nuclear spins are not yet polarized .",
    "the overhauser effect ( oe ) is one of the well known and most effective ways of dnp . in the oe",
    "the allowed electron spin resonance transitions are saturated , and subsequent cross relaxation with the simultaneous spin flips of electron and nucleus leads to the population transfer from one nuclear state to another .",
    "the rate of the oe dnp is determined by the cross relaxation .",
    "there are two possibilities for this process : with an opposite change of the electron and nuclear spins , known as flip - flop transitions ; and with flip - flip transitions , when the electron and nuclear spins flip to the same direction .",
    "both transition probabilities strongly depend on the degree of anisotropy of the interaction between electron and nucleus .",
    "dipole - dipole interaction of the host lattice nuclei with donor electrons has large anisotropy and ensures fast relaxation rate .",
    "due to this reason the oe dnp has been successfully utilized for polarization of the nuclei in solids and liquids via the embedded paramagnetic ions ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "situation is different for the isolated ion or donor atom with unpaired @xmath7-electron .",
    "interaction of the electron with its own ( core ) nuclei is of isotropic fermi type , and the flip - flop transition probability is given by the hyperfine mixing factor @xmath8 , with @xmath9- being the hyperfine constant , @xmath10 - the electron gyromagnetic ratio , and @xmath11 - applied static magnetic field .",
    "the flip - flip transition is fully forbidden in this case .",
    "therefore , efficiency of the oe effect for polarizing donor nuclei was considered to be low , especially in high magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "a second important factor for effective dnp is the nuclear relaxation rate , which is the process responsible for returning the polarization to thermal equilibrium and thus countering the effect of dnp .",
    "main relaxation mechanism at low temperatures is the nuclear orbach process , which also proceed via the flip - flop and flip - flip transitions with the rate weighted by the boltzmann factor @xcite . at low temperatures the nuclear relaxation rate decreases exponentially , increasing efficiency of oe dnp .    despite of the numerous studies , si : p system has not been thoroughly investigated in strong magnetic fields and we are not aware of any works below 1 k. the highest dnp value of @xmath12 has been reached in 8.6 t magnetic field @xcite and at temperatures of @xmath13 k. the nuclear relaxation rate turned out to be fast in these conditions which , regardless of the high electron spin polarization ( @xmath14 ) , limited reaching a higher nuclear polarization . typically in dnp experiments relatively high values of microwave power ( up to 1 w ) were used for irradiating si : p samples .    in the present work",
    "we demonstrate that an efficiency of oe dnp is very high in strong magnetic fields and low temperatures .",
    "we cooled si : p samples to @xmath15 k , which led to a decrease of the nuclear relaxation rate to immeasurably small values and allowed reaching nuclear polarization @xmath16 after excitation of 20 minutes .",
    "we suggest that extremely pure nuclear spin states with @xmath17 can be produced with sub-@xmath1w power levels .",
    "we evaluated the cross relaxation rate by measuring the rate of the dnp , in which the flip - flop transition is the limiting step .",
    "the experimental cell ( sc ) with the si : p sample was placed in the center of a superconductive magnet producing a field of 4.6 t and cooled down by a dilution refrigerator ( fig .",
    "[ expcell ] ) .",
    "the sample of crystalline silicon with natural abundance , 2@xmath182@xmath180.07 mm in size and doped by 6.5@xmath1810@xmath19 @xmath20 of p , was placed onto the flat mirror of a fabry - perot resonator ( fpr ) having a @xmath21 of approximately 4000 .",
    "the crystal s [ 111 ] axis was directed along the axis of the fpr resonator and polarizing magnetic field .",
    "esr spectra from the sample were detected with a cryogenic heterodyne spectrometer @xcite operating at 128 ghz .",
    "the spectrometer provides both absorption and dispersion signal components without a modulation of the magnetic field and is optimized for reaching high sensitivity at a small excitation power .",
    "this is important when studying samples with long electron spin - lattice relaxation times ( @xmath22 s in our case ) . to avoid the saturation of si : p esr lines below 1 k we had to use a very low microwave power for _ detection _ , typically below 1 @xmath23w . for pumping the esr lines in the dnp experiments we used the maximum available microwave power of 0.4 @xmath1w , which will be further referred to as _ pumping _ power .",
    "cooling of the sample to 100 mk could be problematic because of the very large kapitza resistance between the sample and the metal surface .",
    "thermal contact of the sample was improved with a superfluid helium .",
    "the flat mirror with the sample was isolated from the main vacuum by a mylar foil to a separate chamber , which could be filled with liquid helium ( fig .",
    "[ expcell ] )",
    ". however , in this work , we did not observe any significant difference in the thermalization of si : p samples with or without helium film at temperatures above 500 mk .",
    "the cw esr absorption spectrum of a si : p sample recorded just after cooling down to a low temperature is shown in the upper trace of fig . [ dnpspectra ] .",
    "the spectrum consists of two lines corresponding to the allowed _ a - d _",
    "( low field ) and _ b - c _ ( high field ) transitions , separated by @xmath24 g due to the hyperfine interaction of @xmath5p electron with its own nucleus .",
    "the lines are inhomogeneously broadened by the spin-@xmath25 @xmath6si nuclei of the host lattice which reside inside the relatively disperse electron cloud of @xmath5p electron @xcite .",
    "first , we performed a dnp experiment by saturating the allowed _ b - c _ transition .",
    "the magnetic field was set to the center of the _ b - c _ line and the excitation power was increased to the pumping value , aiming at full saturation of the esr transition . for increasing the efficiency of the dnp the esr excitation frequency was modulated with the frequency deviation corresponding to @xmath26 line widths and with the modulation rate of @xmath27 hz . since the electron spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath28 0.2 s is substantially longer than the modulation period , all the spin packets in the esr line are simultaneously saturated . after pumping the _ b - c",
    "_ transition for a time @xmath29 , the spectrometer was switched to detection power , and undistorted spectra with both esr lines were recorded .",
    "then , the nuclear polarization @xmath30 was calculated from the esr absorption line areas , which are proportional to the populations @xmath31 and @xmath32 of the _ a _ and _ b _ states .",
    "the polarization measurement was performed shortly ( @xmath33 s ) after the pumping , so that the nuclear state populations were not influenced by the nuclear relaxation , which turned out to be very slow below 1 k.    the spectra after @xmath34 s and @xmath35 min are shown in the 2nd and 3rd traces of fig .",
    "[ dnpspectra ] .",
    "the dnp occurs due to the overhauser effect , which transfers the population as : _",
    "_ b__@xmath36__c__@xmath36_a _ ( the dashed arrow in fig .",
    "[ dnpspectra ] inset ) .    due to the high @xmath21 of the fpr and the long spin - lattice relaxation time of the @xmath5p electrons , the allowed _ b - c _ transition is fully saturated in a fraction of a second .",
    "it is clear that the dnp rate is limited by the much slower relaxation via the forbidden _ a - c _ transition , characterized by a cross - relaxation time @xmath37 . as we shall see below",
    ", the nuclear polarization can be negative if @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , to check whether the dnp behaves exponentially , we plotted @xmath39 in log units in fig .",
    "[ poldynamics ] .",
    "one can see that the polarization dynamics deviates strongly from an exponential at the beginning of the pumping .",
    "we verified that the esr excitation power is strong enough to saturate the allowed transitions .",
    "pumping dynamics did not depend on excitation power near its maximum value .",
    "we have not observed any reduction in the dnp efficiency after decreasing the power by 2 - 3 db .",
    "only attenuating it by more than 10 db led to a decrease of the dnp .",
    "the characteristic time of the dnp build - up is @xmath320 s at the beginning and @xmath41100 s at the end , when the function is almost exponential .",
    "we estimate that the polarization @xmath0 was reached in this experiment , based on the signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath28 100 since the _ b - c _ esr line vanishes in the noise after @xmath28 20 min of pumping .",
    "next , we pumped the _ a - d _ transition . in this case",
    "the overhauser effect leads to a dnp resulting in the population transfer _",
    "_ a__@xmath36__d__@xmath36_b _ and the creation of negative polarization where @xmath38 .",
    "the result of this experiment is shown in the trace 4 of fig .",
    "[ dnpspectra ] .",
    "the rate of the process is substantially slower than the other cross relaxation _ _ b__@xmath36__c__@xmath36_a_. the polarization was increased by a factor of 2 after about 10 h pumping . since the dnp in this case",
    "is limited by the flip - flip relaxation , we estimated the corresponding relaxation time @xmath40 to be @xmath41 s. this is @xmath42 times larger than @xmath43 .",
    "we repeated the pumping experiment at temperatures 0.2 k , 0.27 k and 0.92 k and found out that the pumping dynamics follows a similar looking non - exponential curve .",
    "the dnp seems to proceed faster when the temperature increases from 0.2 to 0.9 k but above 1 k the nuclear relaxation is so fast that it starts to dominate the level populations .",
    "this indicates that the temperature dependence of the relaxation rate via the forbidden transitions is much weaker than the nuclear relaxation below 1 k. another possible pathway for the dnp would be via the nuclear relaxation between the upper hyperfine states : @xmath44 . in this case ,",
    "the slowest process , _ c - d _ nuclear relaxation , will mediate the transfer rate .",
    "however , as we shall see below , the nuclear relaxation rate has a very strong temperature dependence , which contradicts with the observation that @xmath37 is only weakly temperature dependent .    at temperatures above 1 k , weak signals from the _ b - c _",
    "line were observed even after pumping it for a very long time @xmath45 . since the nuclear _ a - b",
    "_ relaxation is a mechanism competing with dnp , this process can be responsible for the decrease of the maximum dnp value observed at higher temperatures . to verify this , the nuclear _ a - b _ relaxation was studied of as a function of temperature .",
    "we prepared starting conditions where all of the spins were in the _ a_-state by pumping the _ b - c _ esr line as described above .",
    "the temperature was kept at the lowest value of 0.2 k , where the nuclear polarization does not relax within several days .",
    "then , the sample cell was rapidly warmed up and the temperature was stabilized to a desired value between 0.75 and 2.2 k. the evolution of the spin states towards the thermal equilibrium was monitored by measuring repeatedly the esr spectrum with the detection power .",
    "an example of measurement results is shown in fig .",
    "[ rel2 ] with the curve starting with @xmath46 .",
    "one can see that the relaxation does not follow a single exponential decay .",
    "a bi - exponential fit gives a better result , and provides two time constants : short @xmath47 and long @xmath48 .",
    "the relaxation rates @xmath49 and @xmath50 as functions of the inverse temperature are presented in fig .",
    "[ relrate ] .",
    "both relaxation rates follow an exponential dependence on @xmath51 with the activation energy of @xmath52 k. we also included the results of the previous work in strong ( 8.6 t ) magnetic field @xcite in the fig .",
    "[ relrate ] for comparison .    in a further study of the bi - exponential relaxation , we made measurements in which the nuclear polarization was let to relax from @xmath53 to a very low value @xmath54 . then , for a short time ( @xmath55 s ) we pumped the _ b - c _ transition .",
    "as a result , the nuclear polarization was enhanced to @xmath56 .",
    "the subsequent nuclear relaxation measurement revealed that the relaxation was much faster at the same @xmath57 value than it was when the measurement was started after the longer pumping with @xmath58 .",
    "a similar result was found after repeating this measurement for an even smaller starting polarization ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the slopes of the relaxation curves were quite the same at the beginning , meaning that the @xmath47 does not depend on the starting value of the nuclear polarization .",
    "the rate of dnp via the overhauser effect is defined by the probabilities of the flip - flop and flip - flip transitions @xmath60 and @xmath61 . the flip - flop transition for an isolated donor with isotropic hyperfine interaction",
    "is allowed because of the hyperfine mixing of the wave functions .",
    "the flip - flop transition relaxation rate in relation to the allowed one is given as @xmath62 for which @xmath63 for p donors in 4.6 t magnetic field .",
    "this gives @xmath64 s with measured @xmath65 s in these experiments .",
    "the flip - flip transition , on the other hand , is completely forbidden for the isolated donors and thus the cross - relaxation mechanism for the donor electron with its own nucleus has to involve modulation of the hyperfine interaction by the lattice phonons @xcite .",
    "an order of magnitude evaluation of the relaxation time constant can be done from the following equation @xcite @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a numerical factor between 10 and 100 , and @xmath68 is the density of silicon . for si :",

    "( [ tx ] ) gives @xmath69 s ( @xmath70 s ) , which is within an order of magnitude agreement with the experimental results of feher and gere @xcite @xmath71 s in 0.32 t field and @xmath72 s in 0.8 t field and temperature of 1.25 k. we would like to note also that these two values confirm the @xmath73 dependence of the relaxation time .",
    "if we now extrapolate the data to our field of 4.6 t and temperature of @xmath74 k , we get @xmath75 s which is in good agreement with our experimental data for @xmath76 s. so , the phonon induced modulation of the hyperfine interaction@xcite can explain the values of the long cross - relaxation time @xmath43 observed in this work .",
    "however , the fast cross - relaxation @xmath77 s in the beginning of the dnp and the non - zero flip - flip relaxation can not be explained by the theory involved so far .    the observed discrepancy can be explained if we consider the effect of the neighbouring @xmath6si on the p cross relaxation .",
    "the randomly distributed magnetic nuclei of @xmath6si with 4.7@xmath78 abundance may create anisotropy in the hyperfine interaction of p with its own nucleus .",
    "this leads to a strong enhancement of the forbidden relaxation rates , especially for the donors which have one or more @xmath6si in the few closest lattice shells . for these @xmath6si",
    "nuclei the anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction with donor electron leads to a fast nuclear relaxation , which scales as @xmath79 with the distance between the donor and the @xmath6si nucleus @xcite . in a similar fashion",
    "the proximity of @xmath6si may lead to enhancement of the p cross - relaxation .",
    "the donors can be separated into two groups : first - having one or several @xmath6si in the nearest lattice shell , and second - not having @xmath6si nuclei with strong anisotropic interactions nearby . the first kind of donors have an enhanced cross relaxation and thus the dnp rate , which is seen in the first part of the polarization dynamics of fig .",
    "[ poldynamics ] .",
    "once these nuclei get fully polarized , the dnp proceeds more slowly with the donors in the second group , and in this case the observed characteristic time @xmath43 should be about the same as for the p in isotopically purified @xmath80si .",
    "the forbidden cross - relaxation rates also mediates the nuclear relaxation in insulating solids through the nuclear orbach process@xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of the nuclear relaxation rate is given by the boltzmann factor : @xmath81 this means that the nuclear relaxation of the p atoms in the first group should be also faster and could explain our observation of the two time scales in the nuclear relaxation measurements ( figs .",
    "[ rel2 ] and [ relrate ] ) .      for the normal isotope composition",
    ", the @xmath6si nuclear spins play an important role in the spin dynamics of shallow donors @xcite .",
    "the influence of @xmath6si on the p relaxation may complicate further if we consider the possibility of polarizing their spins during the esr pumping .",
    "the polarization transfer between different nuclei is a well known effect.@xcite the polarization of the @xmath6si nuclei in the neighboring lattice sites around the donors should make the p cross relaxation either easier or harder depending on the direction of the polarization .",
    "this may lead to enhancement of the cross relaxation transition probabilities in the initial part of the dnp curve ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and make nuclear relaxation faster in the beginning . in other words , the forbidden relaxation time @xmath82 may depend on the polarization of @xmath6si , which is created simultaneously with the oe dnp of phosphorus .",
    "this influences to the first fast relaxing group of donors , and should not affect to @xmath43 and @xmath48 .",
    "esr technique provides the phosphorus hyperfine state populations , which are proportional to the integrals of the absorption signal .",
    "unfortunately , we could not extract direct information about the @xmath6si polarization due to lack of nmr in the experiments .",
    "some information , however , can be extracted from the esr spectra .",
    "if all the @xmath6si nuclei are polarized , the superhyperfine interaction shifts the esr lines in respect to the lines with unpolarized spin states .",
    "the sign of the shift depends on the polarization direction of @xmath6si . as an example",
    ", we consider a splitting of the donor electron spin levels by superhyperfine interaction with one @xmath6si nucleus , shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "the spin orientations of the @xmath6si level scheme are opposite to the p levels due to the negative gyromagnetic factor of @xmath6si and the splittings of the allowed transitions are smaller because of the weak superhyperfine interaction ( @xmath83 mhz @xcite ) . saturating the whole esr line of p , @xmath84 for example , induces simultaneously transitions @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which has opposite directions of the @xmath6si spins ( denoted with @xmath87 or @xmath88 subscripts in fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "the states @xmath89 and @xmath90 are mixed and they have opposite directions of the electron and @xmath6si nuclear spins .",
    "the flip - flop transitions between these states have a higher probability than the flip - flip @xmath91 transitions .",
    "saturating the esr line creates oe dnp of the @xmath6si in a similar way than in the original overhauser experiment for nuclei in metals . during the pumping the populations",
    "are transferred in both ways : @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and as a result the @xmath6si spin populations are redistributed between @xmath89 and @xmath94 states . due to the higher rate of the flip - flop transition",
    "most of the @xmath6si spins end up in the @xmath95 state .",
    "since the resonant field for the @xmath85 transition is larger , the esr line will acquire shift to the right .",
    "the magnitude of the shift can be estimated numerically by arranging the @xmath6si nuclei randomly into the lattice cites and taking into account known values of hyperfine interactions for each cite @xcite . for fully polarized sample",
    "the evaluation gives @xmath96 g shift .    in the dnp experiments described in section [ sec : results ]",
    "the @xmath5p allowed transitions were pumped for long times , leading to the population transfer from @xmath97 to @xmath98 state and vice versa .",
    "the relaxation time of the @xmath6si nuclear spins is expected to be very long at temperatures of @xmath99 k. therefore , it was difficult to trace the possible shift of the spectrum due to the @xmath6si polarization",
    ". however , we were able to depolarize the sample by applying rf excitation at @xmath100 mhz , resonant with the nmr transition of @xmath6si , and driving its polarization back to zero .",
    "the change in the spectra resulting from the depolarization is presented in fig .",
    "[ shift ] .",
    "the upper trace , recorded for the sample with maximum polarization , is shifted to the right from the unpolarized ( lower ) trace by @xmath101 g. this , according to the considerations above , proves that rather high polarization of @xmath6si was also reached in this work .",
    "the rate of @xmath6si dnp is the highest for the nuclei closest to the donors .",
    "however , due to fast spin diffusion the polarization rapidly propagates into the bulk of the sample @xcite .",
    "the rate of the spin diffusion is substantially slower inside the so - called spin diffusion barrier @xcite which is about 10 nm around p donors in our case , and is comparable to the mean distance between the donors which is about @xmath102 nm . after switching off the pumping",
    ", the nearest @xmath6si will get depolarized by the donors .",
    "the polarization outside the diffusion barrier may decay only because of the nuclear relaxation , which is very slow for remote , non - interacting @xmath6si .",
    "therefore , the @xmath6si nuclear polarization may be rather inhomogeneous during the relaxation measurements .",
    "however , since the diffusion barrier is effectively removed during pumping , when the electron spins are depolarized , we expect that the high bulk polarization of @xmath6si has been obtained immediately after the pumping .",
    "it is well known from the theory of the overhauser effect @xcite , that in the high temperature limit ( @xmath103 ) the dnp enhancement over the thermal polarization is given by the ratio of the electron and nuclear gyromagnetic ratios @xmath104 , which is @xmath28 1600 for @xmath5p . however ,",
    "this is not a correct result in high fields and low temperatures , when the electron polarization is very high and the nuclear spins are nearly unpolarized . at these conditions a much larger polarization enhancement can be reached @xcite . in general case",
    "the equations for hyperfine state populations due to oe can be found in the text books @xcite .",
    "here we present the results in the case of long nuclear relaxation time @xmath105 and low temperatures @xmath106 , which can be obtained from the following considerations .    a microwave excitation saturating fully the electronic _ b - c _ transition for a long enough ( @xmath107 ) time will establish thermal equilibrium between @xmath97 and @xmath108-states and therefore @xmath109 . after switching off the pumping , all the atoms in _",
