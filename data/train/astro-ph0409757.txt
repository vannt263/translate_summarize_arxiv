    "what effect does metallicity have on the mass loss and angular momentum loss of massive stars ? there is a large amount of secondary evidence , some of which is summarized below , suggesting that low metallicity should result in smaller angular momentum loss and subsequently higher rotational velocities for these type stars .",
    "however , there is an unfortunate lack of direct measurements of the equatorial rotational velocity @xmath2 , or even of the projected rotational velocity @xmath1 for massive stars in a low @xmath3 environment .",
    "the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc & smc ) are nearby , contain many young massive objects , and have low @xmath3 values of 0.007 and 0.004 , respectively . as such they present an ideal laboratory to test the dependence of massive star rotation on metallicity .",
    "maeder , grebel , & mermilliod ( 1999 ) found a significant increase in the number ratio of be/(b+be ) stars with decreasing metallicity among galactic and mc clusters ( see , however , the counterarguments presented by keller et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the be phenomenon is closely linked to rapid rotation ( porter & rivinius 2003 ) .",
    "to explain this trend in be star number ratio , the authors raise the possibility that stars forming in a low metallicity environment would have higher initial rotational velocities .",
    "although no numerical models of the formation of massive stars at low @xmath3 have been produced , the authors tentatively present some possible origins of these higher initial rotational velocities .",
    "a lower @xmath3 environment would have lower dust content and fewer metallic ions present in star forming regions so that the magnetic field of the contracting central mass is less coupled to the surrounding region .",
    "also the lifetime of the accretion disk is likely related to its opacity , which will decrease with lower metallicity .",
    "these factors would result in less angular momentum loss during star formation , leading to higher initial rotational velocities .",
    "the possibility of faster initial rotation at low metallicity resulting in more rotational mixing on the main sequence has also been suggested to resolve the nitrogen enrichment seen in smc b- and a - supergiants ( venn et al .",
    "maeder et al .",
    "( 1999 ) state `` of course , direct observations of @xmath0 in lmc and smc clusters are very much needed in order to substantiate the above results .",
    "''    observations of the number ratio of blue to red supergiants in nearby galaxies also show a sharp dependence upon metallicity ( humphreys & mcelroy 1984 ) .",
    "stellar interior models which include rotation can account for this long - standing problem ( maeder & meynet 2001 ) .",
    "the primary cause of this is the mild mixing just outside the core of a rotating star during the main sequence .",
    "this increases the amount of helium near and above the h - shell .",
    "the net effect of the larger he core and the mild main sequence mixing is to decrease the importance of the convective zone above the h - burning shell in the post - main sequence evolution . because of the small polytropic index in the convective zone , the larger the size of the zone the smaller the radius of the star .",
    "conversely , if its contribution is small , the overall size of the star increases , leading to a redward position in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram .",
    "another key prediction of these new models is shown by comparing figure 10 of meynet & maeder ( 2000 ) and figure 3 of maeder & meynet ( 2001 ) . these are plots of the evolution of surface rotational velocities for massive stars in both galactic and smc metallicity , respectively . at low @xmath3",
    ", the surface rotational velocities will remain almost constant during the main sequence evolution , contrary to that of massive stars at solar metallicity where the rotational velocities are predicted to rapidly decrease . theoretically this results from both lower equatorial mass loss and the outward transport of angular momentum from the interior of the star by meridional circulation .",
    "models of massive stars at both metallicities show a drastic decrease in rotational velocity after the terminal age main sequence .",
    "the idea that a low metallicity environment would create massive , rapidly rotating , helium stars has even been raised by theorists as a possible source of gamma - ray burst progenitors ( macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) . here",
    "the outer layers of the star , and , in at least some cases , the mantle have too much angular momentum to fall freely inside the last stable orbit during core collapse .",
    "an accretion disk forms where the dissipation of rotational and gravitational energy will give rise to some sort of mass ejection and electromagnetic radiation , a `` hypernova . ''",
    "this results in the prompt formation of a black hole through hyperaccretion .",
    "stellar rotation is the dominant process in shaping the photospheric lines of o stars .",
    "the vast number of lines present in the ultraviolet spectra of o - type stars suggests that accurate projected rotational velocities could be found by studying these objects in the ultraviolet .",
    "these lines arise from high excitation transitions from deeper in the photosphere , and they are less subject to wind variability than optical lines .",
    "also they are less likely to be contaminated by weak emission from circumstellar and nebular gas .",
    "the standard method of individual profile fitting in the uv is difficult because of line blending .",
    "a powerful alternative involves cross - correlation of a narrow - lined star with a test star , which will result in a cross - correlation function ( ccf ) that represents a `` superline '' of the test star .",
    "this technique actually increases the s / n of the observed spectrum by in effect combining all the uv lines into one .",
    "the `` superline '' will have an observed width related to the line width of the test star and that of the narrow - lined star ( figure 1 ) .",
    "fitting this ",
    "superline \" is the numerical equivalent of fitting each uv absorption feature and combining the resulting measurements .",
    "our previously derived @xmath1 values for 177 galactic o stars were calculated by calibrating the widths of ccfs derived from _ iue _",
    "swp high dispersion spectra as a function of published @xmath1 values from conti & ebbets ( 1977 ) in a common sample of objects ( penny 1996 = p96 ) .",
    "conti & ebbets ( 1977 ) fit artificially broadened model line profiles ( from the non - lte model atmospheres of auer & mihalas 1972 ) of four visual absorption lines to determine their @xmath1 values .",
    "the lines used were h@xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "howarth et al .",
    "( 1997 ) performed a cross - correlation study similar to ours with _ iue _ high resolution spectra of 373 ob - type stars using the template star @xmath8  sco = hd  149438 ( b0.2 iv ) .",
    "although their calibration technique differed slightly from ours , their findings supported those from our study .",
    "methods similar to those above can be utilized with observations of o - type stars made with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) e140 m grating .",
    "the e140 m grating produces in a single exposure an echelle spectrogram covering the wavelength interval @xmath9 , with an effective spectral resolving power of @xmath10 .",
    "this grating set up is complementary to the _ iue _ swp arrangement which was used so effectively to obtain an almost complete catalog of uv observations of galactic o - type stars to @xmath11 .",
    "the multimission archive at space telescope ( mast ) contains spectra of the 18 smc and 6 lmc o - type stars observed with this grating .",
    "there are also stis e140 m grating archival spectra of 12 galactic o - type stars which we obtained in order to calibrate our methodology with the stis observations . although the e140 m spectra are similar in many ways to the swp high resolution spectra in our previous methodology , it is prudent to use these overlapping galactic stars as an experimental checks of our calibration .",
    "there are also available in mast _ iue _ swp high resolution spectra of 4 smc and 16 lmc o - type stars ; one of the latter is among those with archival stis spectra .",
    "the newsips mxhi files of the above swp spectra are spectrograms that cover the wavelength region of @xmath12 .",
    "the archival stis spectra are in extracted one dimensional fits format , forming a near complete spectrogram covering the wavelength range @xmath9 .",
    "we use a series of routines we have written in the interactive data language to further reduce the spectra ( see details in penny , gies , & bagnuolo 1997 ) .",
    "one of the most important steps in our reduction is the placement of the data on a @xmath13 grid , in which each pixel step corresponds to a uniform velocity step of 1 pixel = 10 km  s@xmath14 .",
    "the spectra were smoothed using a gaussian transfer function ( fwhm = 40 km  s@xmath14 ) and the interstellar features are removed .",
    "the spectra are then rectified to a unit continuum .",
    "complete lists of spectra obtained , targets , and their spectral classifications are presented in tables 1 , 2 , & 3 for galactic , smc , and lmc targets , respectively .",
    "spectral classifications given with square brackets are from investigators other than walborn ( see maz - apellniz et al .  2004 ) and are taken from the compilations of howarth & prinja ( 1989 ) , conti & ebbets ( 1977 ) , garmany , conti , & massey ( 1987 ) , conti , garmany , & massey ( 1986 ) , parker et al .",

    "this star is classified as o9.5  v by massey et al .",
    "however , its uv spectrum , plotted in figure  2 , is inconsistent with that designation .",
    "both  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 doublets have p  cygni profiles , which makes this only the third star known in the smc with emission .",
    "this feature in smc is indicative of a supergiant classification .",
    "however , the doublet is extremely weak even in absorption .",
    "in addition to av  423 , we also plot av  15 [ o6.5 ii(f ) ] , av  83 [ o7 iaf+ ] , and ngc346 - 12 [ o9.5-b0 v ] for comparison in figure  2 . whatever the revised type of av  423 , it is clearly not a dwarf star , and we will treat it as an evolved object below .",
    "the spectra for each star are cross - correlated with a narrow - lined template star .",
    "we actually cross - correlate each test star with four different templates in order to get the best ( usually highest ) peak for fitting .",

    "we cross - correlate essentially the full wavelength range of the spectra ( stis : @xmath20 ; _ iue _ : @xmath12 ) , setting to unity regions surrounding the strong p  cygni lines of @xmath21 , @xmath22 1400 , and @xmath22 1550 , since these features reflect wind and not photospheric rotational motion .",

    "the ccfs are rectified and inverted for convenience in fitting and plotting .",

    "we see that the evolved sample has both fewer slow rotators and fewer fast rotators compared to the unevolved sample .",

    "howarth et al .",
    "( 1997 ) came to the same conclusion in their study of projected rotational velocities of galactic o - stars .",
    "they suggest that the evolved stars do indeed spin down as they grow in radius ( removing the fastest rotators from the sample ) and that there exists excess turbulent broadening among the supergiants ( that removes the most narrow - lined stars from the sample ) .",
    "the differences in the distributions of projected rotational velocity between the unevolved and evolved groups appears to support theoretical models that predict a spin - down during the core h - burning phases of evolution ( heger & langer 2000 ; meynet & maeder 2000 ) .",
    "it is important to recognize that most stars with an o spectral type are probably found in the core h - burning phase , even among the more luminous stars ( see the evolutionary tracks of schaller et al .",
    "thus , we expect that the low @xmath3 , magellanic cloud o - stars are also in this phase where the rotational spin - down is predicted to be much less effective than we find in galactic stars ( maeder & meynet 2001 ) .",
    "the low @xmath3 stars should retain an almost constant @xmath2 during their core h - burning evolution .",
    "therefore , we expected that the cumulative distribution function for the low @xmath3 stars would fall well below that of galactic stars , because of the relative excess of rapid rotators .    the existence of a systematic difference between the velocity distributions of galactic unevolved and evolved o - stars ( fig .",
    "4 ) indicates that we must compare like samples between the galactic and magellanic cloud stars in order to avoid spurious results because of differing proportions of unevolved and evolved stars in the groups . a large percentage of our magellanic cloud samples are objects with evolved luminosity classes ( 68% and 90% for the smc and lmc samples , respectively ) . note that we include the two smc stars lacking a luminosity class , av  80 and av  220 , among the evolved stars since walborn et al .",

    "surprisingly , the distributions for all three samples are very similar , with k - s probabilities of @xmath34 and @xmath35 that the lmc and smc samples , respectively , are drawn from the same parent population as the galactic sample .",
    "there is no visible trend of cumulative distribution functions with metallicity .",
    "the lmc sample has slightly faster @xmath0 values than that of the galactic stars , but the smc objects have slightly slower rotation rates than the other two samples .",

    "however , because of our relatively small sample sizes , we clearly need additional measurements to confirm the the result .",
    "are low @xmath3 stars actually rotating at the same speeds as their galactic counterparts ? in order to determine conclusively the answer , a larger number of @xmath1 values for stars in these environments is needed .",
    "a previous study by keller ( 2001 ) examined the rotation rates of 100 early b - type stars in the lmc . compared with a similar sample of galactic stars ,",
