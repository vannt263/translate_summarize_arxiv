    "in situations of practical interest , physical systems evolve in time under the action of well studied operators , one common example is provided by the diffusion processes .",
    "sampling of such an evolving system can be done by sensors or measurement devices that are placed at various locations and can be activated at different times . in practice , increasing the spatial sampling density is usually much more expensive than increasing the temporal sampling rate ( @xcite ) .",
    "given the different costs associated with spatial and temporal sampling , we aim to reconstruct any states in the evolutionary process using as few sensors as possible , but allow one to take samples at different time levels .",
    "besides , in some cases , obtaining samples at a sufficient rate at any single time level may not even be possible , spatiotemporal sampling may resolve this issue by oversampling in time .",
    "a natural question is whether one can compensate for insufficient spatial sampling densities by oversampling in time .",
    "this setting has departed from the classical sampling theory , where the samples are taken simultaneously at only one time level , see @xcite .",
    "dynamical sampling is a newly proposed mathematical sampling framework .",
    "it involves studying the time - space patterns formed by the locations of the measurement devices and the times of their activation . mathematically speaking ,",
    "suppose @xmath3 is an initial distribution that is evolving in time satisfying the evolution rule : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a family of evolution operators satisfying the condition @xmath11 .",
    "dynamical sampling asks the question : when do coarse samplings taken at varying times @xmath12 contain the same information as a finer sampling taken at the earliest time ?",
    "one goal of dynamical sampling is to find all spatiotemporal sampling sets @xmath13 such that the certain classes of signals @xmath3 can be recovered from the spatiotemporal samples @xmath14 . in the above cases ,",
    "the evolution operators are assumed to be known .",
    "it has been well - studied in the context of various evolutionary systems in a very general setting , see @xcite .",
    "another important problem arises when the evolution operators are themselves unknown or partially known . in this case , we are interested in finding all spatiotemporal sampling sets and certain classes of evolution operators so that the family @xmath10 or their spectrum and even the unknown states can be identified .",
    "we call such a problem the unsupervised system identification problem in dynamical sampling",
    ".    applications to wireless sensor networks ( wsn ) is a natural setting for dynamical sampling .",
    "wsn are widely used in many industries , including the health , military , and environmental industries , see @xcite for numerious examples . in wsn ,",
    "a huge amount of sensors are distributed to monitor a physical field such as the pollution , temperature or pressure .",
    "the goal is to exploit the evolutionary structure and the placement of sensors to reconstruct an unknown field .",
    "however , the current approaches and algorithms do not make use of the evolutionary structure of the field , see @xcite .",
    "it is not always possible to place sampling devices at the desired locations .",
    "then we may be able to recover the desired information by placing the sensors elsewhere and use the evolution process to recover the signals at the relevant locations .",
    "in addition , dynamical sampling will make the reconstruction cheaper since we use a reduced numer of sensors .      in this subsection , we state an instance of the unsupervised system identification problem of dynamical sampling in an infinite dimensional setting .",

    "peter and plonka use a generalized prony method to reconstruct the sparse sums of the eigenfunctions of some known linear operators .",
    "our generalization of prony method shares some similar spirits with it , but deals with a fundamentally different problem . in sparse fourier transformation , see @xcite , the idea is to uniformly undersample the fixed signal with different factors so that one can group subsets of fourier space together into a small number of bins to isolate frequencies , then take an aliasing - based search by chinese remainder theorem so that one can recover the coefficients and the frequencies . in our case , intuitively , one can think of recovering of the shape of an evolving wave by observing the amplitude of its aliasing version at fixed coarse locations over a long period of time as opposed to acquiring all of the amplitudes at once , then by the given priors , one can achieve the perfect reconstructions . other similar work",
