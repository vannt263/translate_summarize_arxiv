    "mesic atoms are the useful laboratories for studying the meson - baryon interactions , the meson properties in nuclear medium and the nuclear properties . among others ,",
    "pionic atoms have been long utilized for such studies @xcite .",
    "the binding energies and widths of the pionic bound states are expected to provide us with the unique information of the pion - nuclear interaction @xcite and of the nuclear density distributions @xcite .",
    "the standard method to produce pionic atoms starts with injecting slow negative pions into matter .",
    "the pions will be stopped and trapped in outermost orbits of atoms , then lose energy by emitting auger electrons and x - rays to cascade down to deeper atomic states .",
    "however , the x - ray cascade ceases at the so called last orbital , where the pions are absorbed by the nucleus without going to deeper atomic states .",
    "this prevents us from studying the deep pionic states for heavy nuclei that have large overlap with nuclear density @xcite .    to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "the recoilless mesic atom production by ( d,@xmath0he ) reaction has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this method tries to directly create deeply bound pions by the nuclear reaction without cascade down of the pion from the outer most orbits .",
    "this direct method was proved to be effective and powerful for the study of far deeply bound pionic atoms @xcite .",
    "we can now determine the binding energies and widths of the deepest bound states such as 1s and 2p atomic states from the energy spectra of the emitted @xmath0he .",
    "we remark that the ( d,@xmath0he ) reaction is so powerful that it may also be applied to the creation of neutral meson - nucleus bound states such as the @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesic nuclei @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the physics of the unstable nuclei is one of the most interesting subject in modern nuclear science . since the successful use of a new experimental tool , namely `` beams of unstable nuclei '' @xcite",
    ", the properties of nuclei far from the stability line have been studied extensively in many laboratories where secondary beams of unstable nuclei are available .",
    "one of the exciting findings was the neutron halo structure around the @xmath4li core in @xmath5li @xcite .",
    "since then , the structure and reactions of @xmath1-unstable nuclei have been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .    since the repulsive s - wave pion - nucleus interaction causes the formation of the pionic halo around the core nucleus @xcite , the binding energies and widths of deeply bound pionic atoms are expected to be very sensitive to the structure of the nuclear surface , in particular , to the neutron skin @xcite .",
    "hence , we can expect to obtain new information on neutron / proton distribution of the unstable nuclei by observing the deeply bound pionic atoms .",
    "the determination of the neutron distributions for unstable nuclei is one of the most important subjects in the @xmath1-unstable nuclear physics @xcite .",
    "in addition the ( d,@xmath0he ) reaction with pionic atom formation proceeds through the single - neutron pick up and are known to be very sensitive to the single - particle properties of the neutron in nucleus @xcite .",
    "hence , we can also expect to obtain the new information of the neutron single - particle states @xmath6 in unstable nuclei .",
    "this is very interesting in the context of the possible change of the magic numbers far from stability line @xcite .    for the formation of the deeply bound pionic atoms on unstable nuclei",
    ", we use the inverse kinematics technique , in which a light target such as deuteron is bombarded by radioactive ion ( ri ) beam of intermediate energy and the recoiling light ejectile @xmath0he is detected after forming pionic atoms in the heavy projectile @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the formation cross sections for inverse kinematics reactions d(ri,@xmath0he)x in order to examine the experimental feasibility @xcite .",
    "recently , the existence of the halo like structure of neutron distribution is predicted theoretically in medium heavy mass nuclei like zr isotopes @xcite , which was not considered in our previous work @xcite .",
    "this is very interesting since the existence of the long tail of the neutron wave function may enhance the formation cross section of the deeply bound pionic atoms in unstable nuclei and increase much the experimental feasibility in very unstable region of nuclear chart using the next generation of accelerators such as riken rib factory .",
    "in this paper we study the formation cross sections of the deeply bound pionic states for the medium and heavy halo nuclei .",
    "we simulate the halo - like structure by using the solutions of the schrdinger equation with an one - body neutron potential for various potential depths , and we investigate the effects of the long - tail of the neutron wave functions to the ( d,@xmath0he ) spectra . in section 2 , we describe our theoretical formalism .",
    "we show the numerical results in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the summary .",
    "in this section , we describe our theoretical formalism to investigate the pionic atom formation spectra on halo nuclei .",

    "the nuclear densities shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] are used to calculate the pionic wave functions .    the density distribution of the neutron 3p@xmath61 state and that of the pionic 1s state are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wave ] .",
    "we can see that the neutron single - particle density in the valence level is sensitive to the @xmath7 value and has halo - like tail for the smaller @xmath7 values . on the other hand ,",
    "the density of the pionic atom depends on the @xmath7 value in rather mild manner as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : wave ] .",
    "the binding energy of the 1s pionic state is 6.93mev for @xmath7=1 while 6.67mev for @xmath7=0.765 , respectively .",
    "we also show the calculated root mean square radii for valence neutron levels and show the dependence on the @xmath7 value in table [ pb - rms ] .",
    "we can see that the neutron states with lower angular momenta are more sensitive to the @xmath7 value and develop the longer tail .",
    "this feature is interpreted as the consequence of the centrifugal barrier and was suggested in ref .",
    "we expect that the long tail of the neutron distribution leads to larger cross section for producing deeply bound pionic states since the quasi - substitutional states are know to be largely populated for the recoilless ( d,@xmath0he ) reactions @xcite .    to see this , we show the calculated ( d,@xmath0he ) spectra for @xmath59pb target in fig .",
    "[ fig : pb - spect ] as a function of q - value . here",
    ", we only evaluate the contributions from bound pionic states .",
    "as can be seen in the figure , we find that the formation cross section is significantly enhanced for the case of halo - like neutron distribution corresponding to @xmath7=0.765 .    the formation cross section of [ ( 2p@xmath62)@xmath63(2p)@xmath64 configuration , which has the largest contribution to the spectra , is around factor 3.5 larger for @xmath7=0.765 than that for @xmath7=1.0 which corresponds to no - halo case .",
    "we also find that the shape of the spectrum is considerably influenced with the change of the @xmath7 value .",
    "this is due to ( 1 ) the change of the separation energy of each neutron state as shown in the table [ pb - b.e . ] , and ( 2 ) the change of the momentum transfer for different q - values .",
    "thus , for example , we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : pb - spect ] that the energy difference between two peaks [ ( 2p@xmath62)@xmath63(2p)@xmath64 and [ ( 2p@xmath61)@xmath65(2p)@xmath64 are much closer for @xmath7=0.765 case and there appears the extra strength around q=-127 @xmath66 -128 mev due to the [ ( 2p@xmath62)@xmath63(1s)@xmath64 and [ ( 2p@xmath61)@xmath63(1s)@xmath64 contributions , which are negligible for @xmath7=1.0 case because of the smaller momentum transfer .",
    "we also investigate the case of xe , which is known to have large formation cross section for pionic 1s state coupled to the s@xmath61 neutron state @xcite .",
    "for this case , we used the radius parameters , @xmath67 , @xmath45 and @xmath68 , for the proton and neutron potential listed in table [ table1 ] by assuming the mass number dependence a@xmath69 .",
    "the other parameters are assumed to be the same .",
    "we show the calculated binding energies in table [ xe - b.e . ] .",
    "we do not have the bound 1h@xmath70 state for the value of @xmath7 smaller than 0.775 .",
    "the calculated root mean square radii are shown in table [ xe - rms ] .",
    "we find again that the long halo - like tail is developed well for 3s@xmath61 state , the state with the lowest angular momentum , as in the case of pb .",
    "we show the calculated spectra for the case of xe target in fig .",
    "[ fig : xe - spect ] as a function of the reaction q - value .",
    "we can see again that there exists large enhancement of the cross section for halo - like neutron states .",
    "we also find the change of the spectrum as in the case of pb .",
    "the formation cross sections of [ ( 3s@xmath61)@xmath63(1s)@xmath64 configuration , which has the largest contribution to the spectra , is around factor 2.9 larger for @xmath7=0.775 than that for @xmath7=1.0 which corresponds to no - halo case .    finally , we examined the sensitivity of our results to the theoretical inputs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f=1.0-spect ] , we show the ( d,@xmath0he ) spectra for pb which are calculated by using the nuclear density with the relativistic mean field model(rmf ) @xcite and with the pion - nucleus optical potential obtained by konijn et al . @xcite .",
    "the rmf model gives the nuclear density without the halo - like structure .",
    "for comparison , we also show the results calculated by the nuclear density with the potential parameters in table 1 denoted as @xmath71 @xcite and/or the results with the pion - nucleus optical potential by seki and masutani @xcite ( sm ) .",
    "as seen , the calculated spectra are slightly modified by the above choice of the nuclear densities and the pion - nucleus optical potential .",
    "but these modifications are not significant for the cases considered here .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ fig : f=0.715-spect ] , we show the results by assuming the halo - like nuclear densities .",
    "we adopted the same procedure as in section 2 to simulate the possible halo - like structure of the nuclear density .",
    "the strength of the single - nucleon potential is varied by introducing a single free parameter f as in eq.([eqn : factor ] ) .",
    "the nucleon single - particle potential by koura ( set ob ) @xcite is adopted to see the dependence on the nucleon - nucleus potential . for this potential , we found f=0.715 is the smallest f value which gives the bound 1i@xmath60 single - particle state .",
    "since the overlap of the pion wave function and the nuclear density is larger for this case , we obtained significantly larger widths for the deeply bound pionic states .",
    "thus , the calculated spectrum with the nuclear density by the single nucleon potential by koura is influenced as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f=0.715-spect ] : ( i ) the largest two peaks due to [ ( 2p@xmath62)@xmath63(2p)@xmath64 and [ ( 2p@xmath61)@xmath63(2p)@xmath64 configurations can not be distinguished , and ( ii ) the bump at q=-127 @xmath66 -128mev due to pionic 1s - states contribution is not seen with the nuclear density by koura",
    ". however , we can see that the absolute heights of the peaks in the spectra are roughly the same .",
    "we can conclude that , though the detailed shape of the spectrum is influenced by the theoretical inputs , the formation cross section of the deeply bound pionic states is largely enhanced by the existence of the halo - like structure in the target nucleus .",
