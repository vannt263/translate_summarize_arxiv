    "a cooling rate of @xmath32k / s is chosen in order to have two vortices on average in each bec at the time when the observation starts , about @xmath33 ms after the phase transition .",
    "for the observation of their real - time dynamics , a weakly - destructive imaging technique @xcite is used .",
    "our real - time imaging technique consists of outcoupling a small fraction of atoms , @xmath34 , from the trapped gas in the state @xmath35 to the non - magnetic state @xmath36 .",
    "the extraction , see figure  [ fig:1-sm ] , is performed in a novel way as follows .",
    "the energy difference between the two states is spatially dependent because of the inhomogeneity of the trapping magnetic potential and the gravitational sag @xmath37 m , as depicted in figure  [ fig:1-sm ] .",
    "we transfer atoms to the @xmath36 state by sweeping in frequency a rf field yielding to a resonant front that moves across the trapped bec from top to bottom .",

    "the extracted atoms expand and fall freely under the effect of gravity .",
    "a microwave field is kept on to transfer atoms to the state @xmath40 , which is detectable with the d2 probe light . in particular , at the position @xmath41 m the extracted atoms become resonant to the microwave field , exploiting the differential second order zeeman shift between states @xmath36 and @xmath40 , induced by the spatially varying magnetic field that holds the atoms left in the trap , as sketched in figure  [ fig:1-sm ] .",
    "we probe the extracted atoms via standard absorption imaging after @xmath4  ms of total time of flight at @xmath42 m from the trap center .",
    "such a time of flight is enough for vortices to become visible with our imaging resolution .",
    "a density dip is detected in correspondence to the vortex position .",

    "for the purpose of inferring _ in situ _ vortex information from the post - expansion residual densities , we explicitly simulate the outcoupling and expansion dynamically using the gpe .",

    "while the outcoupled atoms may be relatively dilute , they still experience significant interactions with the dense trapped portion , for several ms , until gravity finally separates the components .",
    "the combined effects of gravity and the intercomponent interactions mean that the speed of the sweep is important .",
    "we choose a sweep speed , both experimentally and theoretically , which rapidly compresses the outcoupled cloud in the vertical direction .",

    "<S> the axial motion of the vortices towards each other , driven by the inhomogeneous density , is faster if the vortices are close to the condensate s boundary @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> briefly , if the axial collision velocity is sufficiently high ( i.e. , if the vortex lines start interacting in a region sufficiently close to the boundary @xcite ) the two vortices tend to reconnect before reaching the center of the condensate , as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]c . </S>",
    "<S> vice versa , if the interaction begins in a region sufficiently close to the @xmath7axis , the radial motion of the vortex lines is fast enough ( with respect to the axial motion ) to get past the radial center of the condensate where they move axially away from each other due to the reversed velocity field induced by the inhomogeneous density : a rebound takes place , as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]a . </S>",
    "<S> an intermediate regime occurs if , while drifting radially away from the boundary of the condensate towards the center , the minimum distance between the vortices in the central region of the condensate is sufficiently small : in this case a double reconnection @xcite occurs , as in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> _ rebounds  _ the simulations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]a ) show that rebound events are characterized by non intersecting vortex trajectories , as we observe experimentally in a subset of images , e.g. in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:2]a can be related to fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1]c , where the orientations extracted from the residuals start from an orthogonal configuration before partially overlapping ( however the trajectories do not intersect ) and then emerge later showing an anti - parallel configuration . </S>",
    "<S> a simpler , non - rotational , bounce is the one in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1]b , where vortices are already anti - parallel before interacting . both of the observed rebounds are characterized by an increased visibility when vortices are very close to each other . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the residuals are generated by subtracting the unperturbed density distributions and vortices become more visible where the vortex - free condensate has larger density . </S>",
    "<S> the observed increase of vortex visibility in rebound events is thus consistent with the radial drift of the vortices towards the @xmath7-axis seen in numerical simulations .    by studying the dynamics of hundreds of different experimental realizations , </S>",
    "<S> we make a statistical analysis which reinforces our interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig:3]a shows the distribution of events as a function of the relative axial velocity of two approaching vortices . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that those events that are identified as rebounds ( with approaching but not touching trajectories ) , preferentially happen when the relative velocity is small . </S>",
    "<S> as anticipated , the relative angle @xmath19 in the radial plane matters when discerning rebound events from reconnections . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3]b shows the rebound probability as a function of the vortex relative angle just before their approach and confirms that rebounds mostly occur between anti - aligned vortices , consistent with the simulations .    _ orbiting dynamics  </S>",
    "<S> _ two parallel vortices can precess around the center of the bec in the same direction with distinct orbit parameters @xmath17 , only weakly interacting when they are at the closest distance . </S>",
    "<S> when imaged from a radial direction , the two vortices appear to cross periodically ; in reality , they pass by each other without visible changes of the residual pattern , with only slight modifications of orbits and visibility at most . </S>",
    "<S> an example of such an orbiting dynamics can be observed in the experimental image fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1]d , and a similar case in the numerical simulations is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]e .    </S>",
    "<S> _ reconnections  _ </S>",
    "<S> if the initial orientation of the vortices is not parallel and the axial collision dynamics is sufficiently fast , single reconnection processes are favored . as simulations show ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2]c , d ) , these reconnection processes cause abrupt deformations of the vortex lines ( similar effects have been observed with numerical simulations in fermi superfluids @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally this implies a sudden change of both the orbit and the residual pattern , accompanied by a significant change of visibility of one or both vortices , as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1]e , f .    </S>",
    "<S> _ ejections  </S>",
    "<S> _ when a vortex orbits the outer part of the condensate ( large @xmath17 ) a fast interaction with another vortex ( either _ via _ a reconnection or a close orbiting interaction ) can cause the expulsion of either vortex towards the surface of the bec , where the density is too low for observation ( the other vortex remaining inside ) . </S>",
    "<S> examples of such ejection processes are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1]f , g ( reconnection - induced and orbiting - induced , respectively ) . the numerical counterpart of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1]f is illustrated in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig:2 ] are modulated by the thomas - fermi density , see supplementary materials ) . </S>",
    "<S> a statistical analysis of experimental data is given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3]c : excluding cases where rebounds occur , we count all events of vortex - vortex interaction as a function of the largest orbit parameter of the vortex pair @xmath25 . then , among them , we show in green those in which one of the two vortex lines is lost in the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the relative distribution in the inset clearly supports the idea that ejections occur at large @xmath17 , i.e. , near the boundary of the condensate , in agreement with the result of the numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> these ejection processes can play a key role in the post - quench dynamics of the bec , when most of the vorticity produced by the kibble - zurek mechanism is progressively lost at the boundaries , eventually leaving only a few vortex lines in the final bec @xcite .    in conclusion , an experimental technique capable of determining the real - time position and orientation of vortex lines in an elongated bec , combined with numerical gp simulations , </S>",
    "<S> allow us to explore novel types of vortex dynamics in a 3d system . while in uniform non - rotating superfluids standard reconnections of vortex lines are unavoidable , and their effects are well known @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , here we show that in a finite and inhomogeneous superfluid , depending on the relative velocity and orientation , two vortex lines can also rebound , perform double reconnections , maintain their orbits with negligible interaction and undergo ejections . these new processes which we have identified should play even more important roles when the bec contains more than two vortices , for example in the case of turbulence @xcite .    * </S>",
