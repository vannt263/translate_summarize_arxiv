    "the primary energy of the jet may be supplied by power extracted from the central rotating bh via interaction with its accretion disk ( blandford & znajek 1977 ; blandford & payne 1982 ; see also discussions in cavaliere & delia 2002 and mckinney 2005 ) .    the blazar 0716 + 714 is a distant bl lac at @xmath7 ( nilsson et al .",

    "moreover , the absence of the signatures of ic catastrophe provided a lower limit @xmath74 for the doppler factor ( ostorero et al .",

    "we note that modeling the sed of with a standard one - zone ssc model would fail to reproduce the simultaneous radio , optical , x - ray and data for the october flare .",
    "in particular , the crossover in the x - ray band would not be well reproduced , and the hard x - ray flux would be overestimated by a factor @xmath763 ; furthermore it would be difficult to model the hardness of the spectrum during the september flare ( figure 1 red dashed lines ) .",
    "a one - component model also hardly explain together the slow trends of the radio , optical and hard x - ray bands and the faster variability observed in the optical , soft x - ray and bands ( see villata et al .",
    "2008 , giommi et al .",
    "2008 , chen et al .",

    "under the assumption of isotropic emission , the observed power radiated from a source with luminosity distance @xmath78 is @xmath79 .",
    "the jet transports a total power @xmath80 contributed by intrinsic radiated power , kinetic energy flow of the electrons and of the cold protons ( with one proton per emitting electron ) , and poynting flux , respectively : @xmath81 see also celotti & ghisellini ( 2008 ) .",
    "the latter authors show that in bl lacs @xmath82 tends to match the sum of the other contributions .",
    "in fact , for the two flares of at redshift @xmath83 we find @xmath84 , and from our two - component ssc model ( with the parameters listed in table 2 ) we obtain a total jet power @xmath85 with @xmath86 . under this condition the total jet power is minimized and the details of cooling does not affect materially the global energetics , being the radiated luminosity @xmath82 mainly contributed by peaks emission . moreover , the uncertainty in @xmath87 is mainly due to the observed flux error .    for the one - component model , we obtain @xmath88and @xmath89 holds . in this case , the total jet power is not dominated by the radiated one , but the parameters now are well constrained by the observation and the uncertainty is still due to the flux error .      here ,",
    "we compare the jet powers provided by our models with the bz mechanism ; this set a limit on the power extractable from a rotating bh @xmath90 under conservative values of @xmath28 , as discussed in cavaliere & delia ( 2002 , and references therein ; see also our discussion ) .",

    "recently , however , nilsson et al . ( 2008 ) pinpointed the host galaxy of this source and reported a determination of its redshift at @xmath91 .",
    "then , for this host , a bh of mass @xmath92 should accord with the fundamental plane of bl lacs ( falomo et al .",

    "however , these authors discuss that the micro - variability in may be due to a small region in the jet or due to internal disk modes , so that the bh mass would be higher .",
    "we note that a bh of mass @xmath97m@xmath5 in would imply in equation ( 13 ) a power limit @xmath98 inconsistent with the power @xmath82 emitted during the flares .",
    "we modeled the flares of 2007 september 11 and october 23 with a two - component ssc model , similarly to tavecchio @xmath99 ghisellini ( 2009 ) . despite the larger number of model parameters",
    ", we believe that our two - component modeling reproduces the complex variability and the hard spectra of better than a one - component model .",
    "our figure 2 indicates a quadratic dependence between the synchrotron and ic fluxes .",
    "this concurs with the lack of emission lines and bbb to rule out models involving external sources of seed photons that produce a linear dependence , and to strongly support electrons radiating in the thomson regime within the ssc framework as the most likely radiation process .",
    "we refer to our figures 2 and 1 in chen et al .",

    ", the trajectory describes the decline of a flare starting from the higher @xmath100 value .",
    "rises and falls both occur on 1-day timescale , and the trajectories are quadratic .",
    "this suggests the electron acceleration and cooling to occur on similar timescales .",
    "the crossover between the synchrotron and ic branches of the sed is located in x - rays ( see also foschini et al . 2006 ; ferrero et al .",
    "2006 ) , and is contributed by both the slowly variable component ( i ) and the faster component ( ii ) .    as to the faster components ( ii )",
    "adopted for the two flares , they are marked by high electron energies @xmath101 with a sharp low energy cutoff @xmath102 ( see also tsang & kirk 2007 ) .",

    "( 1996 ) . in table 2",
    ", it is shown that our choice of parameters implies @xmath105 for the _ fast _ components ii : those quench very rapidly causing strong variability in the optical - uv , soft x- and bands .",
    "little or no variability results in radio and hard - x ray bands produced by the rising part of the _ slow _ components i. this behavior is in agreement with the complex multi - band variability reported by chen et al .",

    ", the total power becomes @xmath108 for the two - component model , and @xmath109 for the one - component model : the source exceeds the bz limit @xmath110 ( see figure 3 ) .",

    "the _ simultaneous _ nature of our multifrequency data during the 2007 flares of is a crucial ingredient of our result .",
    "other bl lacs with weak or negligible accretion disk or blr contributions have been reported to attain ( model dependent ) high total luminosities , e.g. , 2032 + 107 with an inferred @xmath113 ( see celotti & ghisellini 2008 ) .",
    "corbel & reyes ( 2008 , atel 1744 ) report the high peak flux recently attained by 0235 + 164 at @xmath114 for which , however , ec contributions can not be ruled out .",
    "however , to our knowledge , only the simultaneous data obtained by our group for provide a model independent evaluation of the total jet power from a bl lac being close or just above the bz limit .",
    "we also show in figure 3 the intrinsic radiated power for other bl lacs with intense and tev emissions as for the 1997 flare of bl lacertae with peak flux around @xmath115 but with lower redshift @xmath116 ( bloom et al .",

    "we also report w comae with redshift @xmath117 but flux at levels of @xmath118 ( bttcher , mukherjee & reimer 2002 ) .",
    "the increasing trend of @xmath119 with @xmath31 is likely to arise from the malmquist bias , while the decrease at low @xmath31 may result from sampling a limited cosmological volume .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that up to now no bl lac source has sharply exceeded the bz limiting power .",
    "it will be worthwhile to keep under close watch the most distant bl lacs ( despite the obvious monitoring difficulties ) to catch powerful emissions .",
    "if violations will be found , these may be possibly discussed in terms of the blandford - payne mechanism ( blandford & payne 1982 ) that , however , requires ongoing accretion not supported in the case of .",
    "alternatively , higher powers may be attained with higher magnetic fields up to @xmath120 related to the plunging orbits ( see meier 1999 ) , which however imply short source lifetimes in the absence of accretion .    in conclusion",
    "we find the total power transported in the jet of 0716 + 714 to be @xmath121erg@xmath0s@xmath12 , and so to approach the limit of the bz mechanism for a bh up to @xmath122m@xmath5 with _ conservative _ values of @xmath28 .",
    "such high powers in constitute an unescapable consequence of two observed facts :    * the flux attains high levels in the sed during the two flares , with an emitted power comparable with the optical one as shown by simultaneous observations ( see figure 1 ) ; * the lack of external sources of seed photons related to emission lines or bbb concurs with the observed quadratic dependence @xmath69 to rule out ec contributions to the high energy hump ( see figure 2 ) and considerable ongoing accretion ."
