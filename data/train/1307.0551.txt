    "so that , in the paper i , we have reported that it is more appropriate for pg 0052 + 251 to describe the observed broad h@xmath1 by two broad components rather than by one broad component , and then reported the strong evidence for the intermediate blr with the size about 700 light - days , besides the common blr with the size about 100 - 200 light - days as discussed in kaspi et al .",

    "i , we have discussed that the intermediate blr is not the extended part of the common inner blr , i.e , there is enough physical geometrical distance between the common inner blr and the intermediate blr .",
    "therefore , it will be interesting to check whether the common inner blr and the proposed intermediate blr have much different kinematic properties ( such as much different properties of kepler velocities of the line clouds in the two regions ) , which is the main objective of the manuscript .",
    "in other words , we should check the properties of the line parameters ( line width tracing properties of kepler velocity , and line flux tracing distance between the line region and the central black hole ) of the broad optical balmer lines from the inner blr and from the intermediate blr for pg 0052 + 251 .",
    "it is very difficult to clearly reconstruct the detailed kinematic structures of the inner blr and the intermediate blr , through the sparse and incomplete observational data series of pg 0052 + 251 .",
    "therefore , in the manuscript , we only check the simple correlations between the line width and the line flux of the broad lines from the two line regions . surely , the correlation should be strongly negative , under the virialization assumption ( bennert et al .",

    "therefore , if the correlations are much different for the broad lines from the inner blr and from the intermediate blr for pg 0052 + 251 , we should confirm that the kinematic properties are intrinsically different for the two line regions , and should give some further structure information about the intermediate blr .",

    "however , we can find that the apparent he  ii lines have strong effects on the line profile of the observed broad h@xmath0 .",
    "certainly , we will find that there are much weak optical fe  ii lines in the spectra of pg 0052 + 251 . and",

    "( 2004 ) and in zhang ( 2011b ) , the agn continuum emission underneath the observed h@xmath0 is determined by the two continuum windows with the rest - wavelength from 4690to 4750and from 5115to 5175 , without the considerations of the effects of the weak fe  ii and he  ii lines .",
    "it is clear that the blue window used to determine the continuum is on the shoulder of the broad he  ii line , which will lead to much steeper determined agn continuum , and lead to much weak broad wings of the broad h@xmath0 .",

    "1993 is shown , because of the more apparent he  ii and optical fe  ii lines in the spectrum .",
    "the spectral properties are discussed twice as follows .",
    "on the one hand , the spectral lines are fitted within the wavelength range from 4690to 5175without the consideration of the he  ii line , as what have been done in the literature . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral lines are fitted within the wavelength range from 4400to 5500with the consideration of the he  ii line and the weak optical fe  ii lines .",
    "it is clear that there are strong effects of the he  ii line on the determined agn continuum ( the dashed and the dot - dashed lines in the figure  [ heii ] ) .",
    "then , the line profile of the broad h@xmath0 is roughly checked .",
    "more detailed discussions about the fitting procedure for the emission lines could be found in the following subsection .",
    "if the spectral lines are considered within the narrower wavelength range from 4690to 5175 , the broad h@xmath0 can be well described by one broad gaussian function ( the dashed line near the bottom in the figure  [ heii ] ) .",
    "however , the broad h@xmath0 can be well described by two broad gaussian functions ( the solid lines near the bottom in the figure  [ heii ] ) , if the spectral lines are considered within the wider wavelength range from 4400to 5500 . actually , the more recent optical fe  ii template discussed in the kovacevic et al .",
    "( 2010 ) has been included in our procedure , in order to clearly remove the probable effects of the optical fe  ii lines ( the shadow areas near the bottom in the figure  [ heii ] ) . based on the results in the figure  [ heii ]",
    ", we can find that the fe  ii lines are much weak and have few effects on our results about the line parameters of the broad h@xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that there are apparent and strong effects of the he  ii line on the final results , especially on the agn continuum and on the wings of the broad h@xmath0 .",
    "thus , the effects of the he  ii line should be well considered . and",
    "therefore , in the following procedure to fit the spectral lines around the h@xmath0 , the wider wavelength range from 4400to 5500is accepted , rather than the narrower wavelength range from 4690to 5175 .      in the manuscript , in order to obtain more reliable line parameters , the lines around the h@xmath1 ( the broad and the narrow h@xmath1 and the [ n  ii]@xmath13doublet ) and around the h@xmath0 ( the broad and the narrow h@xmath0 , the broad he  ii line , the [ o  iii]@xmath14doublet and the optical fe  ii line ) are fitted simultaneously within the wavelength ranges from 4400to 5500for the lines around the h@xmath0 and the ranges from 6300to 6900for the lines around the h@xmath1 .    in the manuscript ,",
    "two different models are considered to describe the observed broad balmer lines : the model with two broad gaussian functions applied for each observed broad balmer line , and the other model with one broad gaussian function applied for each observed broad balmer line . besides the two models for the broad balmer lines , the narrow lines are described by narrow gaussian functions with similar line profiles , i.e. , they have the same emission line redshifts , the same line width . and",
    "moreover , the [ o  iii ] ( [ n  ii ] ) doublet has the fixed theoretical intensity ratio .",
    "furthermore , one broad gaussian function is applied for the he  ii line .",
    "then , two power law functions are applied for the continuum under the h@xmath0 and the continuum under the h@xmath1 ( @xmath15 ) .    moreover , when two broad gaussian functions are applied for each observed broad balmer line , the following restrictions are set : @xmath16 where @xmath5 and @xmath17 mean the broad line width ( the second moment as discussed in peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) and the broad emission line redshift of the corresponding broad component , the suffixes 1 and 2 represent the broad components from the corresponding broad line regions ( 1 for the inner broad component and 2 for the intermediate broad component ) .",
    "the restrictions can be reasonably accepted under the following considerations .",
    "if the two broad components were physically true for the broad h@xmath1 and the broad h@xmath0 , the result could be expected under the virialization assumption that @xmath18 where @xmath6 means the distance between the broad line region and the central black hole .",
    "once the results @xmath19 are accepted , we can find the restriction for the line width ratio in the equation ( 2 ) .",
    "and moreover , once we accepted that the inner ( intermediate ) broad components of the h@xmath1 and the h@xmath0 from the same physical emission region , the restriction on the broad line redshift in equation ( 2 ) can be naturally accepted .    according to the models above and the corresponding restrictions ,",
    "the spectral lines can be well fitted through the levenberg - marquardt method .",
    "then , the results are firstly checked under the model with one broad gaussian function applied for each observed broad balmer line . here , we do not show the best fitted results for all the 53 observed spectra , but two simple examples with the maximum and the minimum line widths of the broad h@xmath0 in the figure  [ hab1_fit ] .",
    "the basic correlations of the line parameters of the broad h@xmath1 and the broad h@xmath0 are checked and shown in figure  [ hab1 ] .",
    "it is clear that there is no clear broad line width correlation : the spearman correlation coefficient is 0.14 with @xmath20 , and no clear broad line flux correlation : the coefficient is 0.29 with @xmath21 .",
    "if the broad h@xmath1 and the broad h@xmath0 are from the unique region , strong broad line flux and broad line width correlations should be expected .",
    "the much weak correlations shown in the figure  [ hab1 ] indicate single broad component applied for each broad balmer line is not so reasonable , and further considerations should be checked .",
    "then , the model with two broad components applied for each observed broad balmer line is considered , with the restrictions in the equation ( 2 ) . and",
    "moreover , by the following three steps , the model can be checked and further confirmed .",
    "the broad line parameters of the broad balmer lines are firstly checked under the model .",
    "then , the f - test technique is applied to check which model is preferred for the broad balmer lines .",
    "finally , the time - lagged correlations are checked .",
    "the best fitted results for the spectral lines are shown in the figure  [ hab2_fit ] under the model with two broad components applied for each observed broad balmer line .",
    "the measured line parameters are listed in the table 1 .",
    "then , we check the correlations of the line parameters of the broad components of the balmer lines in the figure  [ hab2 ] .",
    "the corresponding correlations of the line parameters are apparent and strong ( coefficient not less than 0.7 with @xmath22 less than @xmath23 , the corresponding coefficients and @xmath22 are marked in each panel of the figure ) , @xmath24 it is clear that the broad line width ratios and the broad line flux ratios for the inner / intermediate broad components are more reasonable",
    ".    moreover , the properties about the relative shifted velocities of the two broad components are checked and shown as the open circles in the figure  [ vel ] .",
    "it is clear that the time dependent relative shift velocities are strongly linear decreasing ( the coefficient is 0.61 with @xmath25 ) , and the best fitted result ( the solid line in the figure ) can be written as , @xmath26 furthermore , the figure  [ vel ] shows the properties of the relative shift velocities of the intermediate broad component relative to the narrow [ o  iii]@xmath27(solid circles in the figure ) .",
    "we can find that the intermediate broad components have tiny relative shift velocities to the narrow [ o  iii ] .",
    "the time dependent rather than one randomly distributed relative shift velocities between the inner broad and the intermediate broad components strongly indicate the two components have physical meanings : one line region having no radial components and the other component having apparent radial moving contributions . here , we should note the inner blr including different contributions from different components does not have the similar meaning as the multiple blrs . in the manuscript and in the literature ,",
    "we accept and define that the inner blr and the intermediate blr mean they are two physical separated line emission regions with apparent physical space between the two regions . in other words , the observed complicated spectral broad lines do not indicate there are two or multiple blrs , because the different line components were perhaps included in the same line region .",
    "meanwhile , the current quality of the spectra can not provide further information to discuss whether the radial components are from the other line region which has apparent physical space from the inner blr and/or the intermediate blr .",
    "thus , no further discussions about the radial motions are shown in the manuscript .",
    "then , the f - test technique is applied to determine which model is preferred for the observed broad balmer lines .",
    "based on the best fitted results by the two models above , the f values firstly are calculated as @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the sum of squared residual for one model , the suffix 1 is for the model with one broad component applied for each observed broad balmer line , and the suffix 2 is for the model with two broad components applied for each observed broad balmer line , @xmath30 represents the degree of freedom for one model . through the comparison between the calculated value @xmath31 by the equation ( 6 ) and the f - value estimated by the f - distribution with the numerator degrees of freedom of @xmath32 and the denominator degrees of freedom of @xmath33 , we can conclude our preferred model .",
    "based on the selected wavelength range for the lines around the h@xmath1 and around the h@xmath0 and the model parameters , the values of the degrees of freedom for the two models are : @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "it is clear that the f - value by the f - distribution with @xmath36 is 2.6 ( the idl function @xmath37 ) based on the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom .",
    "however , the calculated values @xmath31 listed in the figure  [ hab2_fit ] by the equation ( 6 ) are much larger than 2.6 , which strongly indicates that it is more preferred to describe each observed broad balmer line by two broad components .",
    "furthermore , the time - lagged correlations are checked for the two broad components .",
    "if the inner and the intermediate broad components were physically true and from two independent line regions , there should be much different time lags between the variabilities of the agn continuum and the two broad components .",
    "and then , based on the time - lagged results , we can confirm whether the model dependent line parameters are physically reliable or only the mathematical model results . before proceeding further , one point",
    "we should note . because of the effects of the he  ii lines and the narrow lines around the h@xmath1 , it should be not so appropriate to directly use the scaled light curves of the h@xmath1 and the h@xmath0 shown in the kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , as what we have done in paper i. therefore , the light curves of the two broad components of the h@xmath0 ( the h@xmath1 ) are determined with the assumption that the [ o  iii]@xmath27 flux is constant , @xmath38\\lambda5007\\aa)}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the mean flux of the [ o  iii]@xmath27 , @xmath40 is the line flux for the corresponding broad component directly measured through the observed spectrum , @xmath41 means the corrected line flux .",
    "it is clear that there is no time - dependent trend for the [ o  iii ] , and the rms variation about the mean is around 10% , which indicates the flux normalization to the [ o  iii ] flux is necessary .",
    "moreover , we can find that the center wavelengths of the [ o  iii]@xmath27have tiny shifts , which is perhaps due to the large dispersions and spectral resolutions of the original spectra of pg 0052 + 251 ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) . meanwhile , the center wavelength shifts of the [ o  iii ] have few effects on our final results about the broad line parameter correlations . thus , there are no further discussions about the shifts in the manuscript .",
    "once the observational light curves of the broad components are determined , the commonly accepted iccf technique ( interpolated cross correlation function , gaskell & peterson 1987 , koratkar & gaskell 1989 , koptelova et al .",
    "2006 , peterson 1993 ) and the more recent spear technique ( stochastic process estimation for agn reverberation based on the damped random walk model for agn variability , kelly et al .",
    "2009 , kozlowski et al .",
    "2010 , macleod et al .",
    "2010 , zu et al .",
    "2011 ) are applied to check the time lags between the variabilities of the continuum and the inner / intermediate broad components . here",
    ", the light curve of the continuum is the one collected from kaspi et al .",
    "moreover , when the commonly used iccf method is applied , the direct interpolating method is not only applied to the measured observational light curves ( the open circles in the right panels of figure  [ lag_hb ] and figure  [ lag_ha ] ) of the broad components and the continuum emission , but also applied to the best descriptions of the light curves determined by the damped random walk method ( the shadow areas in the right panels of figure  [ lag_hb ] and figure  [ lag_ha ] ) , in order to reduce the effects of the large time gaps of the observational light curves .",
    "moreover , the two different method ( iccf and spear ) should lead to more reliable results , if there were similar iccf and spear results .",
    "the time - lagged correlations are shown in the figure  [ lag_hb ] for the broad components of the h@xmath0 and in the figure  [ lag_ha ] for the broad components of the h@xmath1 .",
    "it is clear that there are apparent ans different time lags between the broad components and the agn continuum based on the iccf and spear results , @xmath42 where the uncertainties with @xmath43 confidence levels of the time lags are determined by the bootstrap method as what we have done in paper i , and the iccf results are the mean values based on the observational light curves and the light curves determined through the random walk method .",
    "the results strongly support that the two model dependent broad components are both mathematically and physically true , and have much different structures , and it is more preferred to describe the observed broad balmer line by two broad components for pg 0052 + 251 .",
    "now , based on the reliable measured line parameters and the corresponding uncertainties , the correlations of the broad line parameters of the two broad components of the balmer lines can be checked .",
    "the linear correlation coefficients are about -0.63 with @xmath44 , 0.72 with @xmath45 , -0.48 with @xmath46 and 0.69 with @xmath47 for the correlations between the line width and the line flux for the inner broad h@xmath1 , for the intermediate broad h@xmath1 , for the inner broad h@xmath0 and for the intermediate broad h@xmath0 respectively .",
    "the strong correlations are shown in figure  [ flux_width ] .",
    "it is clear that there are much different properties for the inner and the intermediate broad components of pg 0052 + 251 : one clear positive correlation for the intermediate broad component , but one clear negative correlation for the inner broad component .",
    "the best fitted results for the correlations with the considerations about the uncertainties in both the coordinates can be written as , @xmath48 meanwhile , the corresponding 99.95% confidence bands for the best fitted results above are also shown in figure  [ flux_width ] .    before the end of the subsection ,",
    "one point we should mote . based on the fitted results shown in the figure  [ hab2_fit ] and the listed line parameters in the table 1",
    ", we can find that there are five spectra of which the narrow h@xmath1 ( and/or [ n  ii]@xmath49 ) are much stronger , while the narrow h@xmath0 are much weaker : jd-2448837 , jd-2449219 , jd-2449249 , jd-2449279 and jd-2450459 .",
    "we do not know the clear reason why the narrow balmer lines are much different from the lines in the other spectra .",
    "however , we can find that the results have few effects on our final results about the broad line parameters correlations , because no different re - calculated broad line parameters correlations can be found without the considerations of the five spectra with the different narrow lines . without the considerations of the five cases , the corresponding correlation coefficients are about -0.62 with @xmath50 , 0.74 with @xmath51 , -0.49 with @xmath52 and 0.72 with @xmath53 for the correlations between the broad line width and the broad line flux for the inner broad h@xmath1 , for the intermediate broad h@xmath1 , for the inner broad h@xmath0 and for the intermediate broad h@xmath0 respectively .",
    "therefore , no apparent effects of the narrow lines in the several special cases can be found for our final results .",
    "thus , there are no further discussions about the cases with special narrow lines in the manuscript .    as we commonly know",
    "that the properties of the broad line flux can be used to trace the distance between the broad line clouds and the central black hole , and the properties of the line width can be used to trace the kepler velocities of the broad line clouds .",
    "the different correlations between the line width and the line flux for the inner and the intermediate broad components strongly indicate there are much different properties of the two broad line regions of pg 0052 + 251 .",
    "it is clear that based on the widely accepted virialization assumption for the broad line agn , the negative correlation between the line width and the line flux can be expected for individual object .",
    "such negative correlation has been found and confirmed for several mapped objects , such as ngc5548 ( bentz et al .",
    "2006 , denney et al .",
    "2010 , peterson et al .",
    "2004 , zhang 2011a ) and some other mapped objects discussed in peterson et al .",
    "then based on the empirical relation to estimate the size of the blr @xmath54 ( bentz et al .",
    "2006 , 2009 , denney et al .",
    "2010 , kaspi et al .",
    "2005 , greene et al .",
    "2010 , wang & zhang 2003 ) , one strongly negative correlation between the broad line flux and the broad line width can be expected for individual object . meanwhile , the common viewpoint about gravity dominated blr can be used to naturally explain the negative correlation ( kollatschny & zetzl1 2011 , krause et al . 2011 , netzer & marziani 2010 , peterson & wandel 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "moreover , we should note that if the common value @xmath55 was accepted for the empirical relation to estimate the blr size of agn , we should expect the slope of the correlation for the inner broad component is about @xmath56 , which is smaller than the reported slope ,",
    "@xmath57 shown in figure  [ flux_width ] for pg 0052 + 251 . the difference can be well and naturally explained by the following reason : the shape of the continuum changes as agns vary , i.e. , variability amplitudes are different for uv and optical bands . and moreover , uv flux rather than optical flux is a better measure for ionizing flux which is one much better indicator for the size of blr . so that , the different variability amplitudes in uv and optical bands lead to some different slope from @xmath56 for the correlations of the inner broad components of pg 0052 + 251 , and smaller variability amplitudes in optical bands lead to the slope larger than @xmath56 .    besides the negative correlation for the inner broad h@xmath1 , there is one clear positive correlation between the line width and the line flux for the intermediate broad components of pg 0052 + 251 , which is against the virialization assumption .",
    "however , we ( zhang 2013a ) have recently reported that there is one positive correlation between the line width and the line flux of the broad double - peaked h@xmath1 of the well - known mapped object 3c390.3 .",
    "furthermore , we have discussed that the positive correlation of broad line parameters could be used as one indicator for the accretion disk origination of the broad lines . so that , if the accretion disk origination was accepted for the intermediate broad components of pg 0052 + 251 , the positive correlation could be naturally explained , as we have explained the positive correlation for the double - peaked emitter of 3c390.3 .",
    "although there are different dependent modes of the size of blr on the line flux for the two components , the correlation between the measured size of the blr ( not the line flux ) and the line width can be checked under the virialization assumption : similar black hole masses determined by the properties of the inner blr and the intermediate blr @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the mean line widths of the inner broad and the intermediate broad components of the h@xmath1 , and @xmath6 is the weighted mean value from the iccf and spear results ( equation ( 8) ) .",
    "similar result can be confirmed for the two broad components of the h@xmath0 .",
    "the results indicate the measured time lags for the inner / intermediate broad components are reliable , and the two model - calculated components are not fake .",
    "before the end of the manuscript , there are two points we should note . on the one hand ,",
    "the main objective of the manuscript is to provide further evidence for the intermediate blr of pg 0052 + 251 .",
    "the much different and reliable correlations for the two components in the figure  [ flux_width ] provide enough evidence to support our objective .",
    "therefore , no further discussions are shown for the detailed structure information on the two broad components .",
    "the apparent time - dependent shifted velocities of the inner broad component ( figure  [ vel ] ) indicates probable radial contributions for the component .",
    "the positive correlation provides the possibility for the accretion disk origination of the intermediate broad components .",
    "so far only two individual agns , 3c390.3  in our previous paper and pg 0052 + 251  in the manuscript , have shown the positive correlation between the line width and the line flux . meanwhile ,",
    "the accretion disk origination for the double - peaked broad lines have been widely accepted for the 3c390.3 .",
    "therefore , we naturally presume but not confirm that the intermediate broad balmer lines of pg 0052 have the similar characters as the lines of 3c390.3 .",
    "surely , more efforts should be done to give the final confirmed conclusions about the structures of the two components , which is beyond the scope of the manuscript . on the other hand ,",
    "more reasonable continuum windows are selected to determine the agn continuum especially under the h@xmath0 in the manuscript , which leads to some different blr size based on the h@xmath0 variabilities .",
    "if the contributions of the narrow lines are subtracted , the measured size of the blr is around @xmath61 light - days based on the h@xmath0 variabilities , similar with the values determined by the h@xmath1 variabilities .",
    "therefore , the position of pg 0052 + 251 is reasonable in the plane of @xmath3 versus @xmath4 .",
    "the selected narrower wavelength range to determine the continuum lead the inner broad h@xmath0 being much weakened . yet , in other ways , it is effective to select the objects with probable intermediate blr through the properties of objects in the plane of @xmath3 versus @xmath4 .",
    "our final main conclusions are as follows .    * due to the apparent he  ii line , the much wider wavelength ranges should be selected to determine the agn continuum under the h@xmath0 , otherwise , the wide wings of the h@xmath0 should be artificially removed . *",
    "the observed broad balmer lines are being fitted by two models .",
    "if the model with only one simple broad component was applied for each observed broad balmer line , the corresponding broad line parameters correlations between the broad h@xmath1 and the broad h@xmath0 are much weak ( figure  [ hab1 ] ) .",
    "however , under model with two broad components applied for each observed broad balmer line , the broad line width and the broad line flux correlations are much strong and more reasonable for the corresponding broad components of the h@xmath1 and the h@xmath0 ( figure  [ hab2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the f - test technique has been applied to check the two models , and indicates two broad components for the broad balmer line ( figure  [ hab2_fit ] ) are preferred .",
    "then , the time - lagged correlations have been checked for the two components ( figure  [ lag_hb ] and figure  [ lag_ha ] ) .",
    "the much different time lags between the two broad components and the continuum ensure that the two components are not mathematical model dependent components but have physical meanings for different geometric structures . *",
    "based on the measured line parameters , one positive correlation between the line width and the line flux can be found for the intermediate broad component , but one negative correlation can be found for the inner broad component , of the balmer lines of pg 0052 + 251 .",
    "the different correlations strongly support the intermediate blr of pg 0052 + 251 , and clearly indicate the inner blr and the intermediate blr have much different dynamic / geometric structures .",

    "as what we have discussed in paper i , there are perhaps atmospheric absorption features on the parameters of the emission lines around 7620in the observer frame . however , as one high luminosity qso , it is hard to clearly determine the absorption features by the collected spectra with moderate quality ( @xmath62 ) .",
