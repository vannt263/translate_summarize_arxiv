    "our ability to experimentally enforce quantum mechanical behaviors in complex systems of a diverse nature is improving at a steady pace  @xcite and is swiftly leading us toward the grasping of the long craved quantumness at the macro scale .",
    "however , the faithful direct inference of quantum properties of parts of a complex systems or of a meso - system or macro - system is not a simple task to accomplish",
    ". this could be due to the intrinsic impossibility to directly address the system we are interested in or to its inherent complexity , which might face the lack of stringent and certifiable criteria for non classicality .",
    "the idea of indirectly probing the system of interest by coupling it to fully controllable detection devices appears very appealing  @xcite .",
    "it has spurred interest in designing techniques for the extraction of information from noisy or only partial data - sets gathered through observations of the detection system .",
    "the main problem in such an approach is embodied by the set of extra assumptions that one has to make on the mechanisms to test and the retrodictive nature of the claims that can be made .",
    "in fact , one can a posteriori interpret a data - set and infer the properties of a system that is difficult to address by post - processing the outcomes of a few measurements .",
    "however , this requires assuming knowledge of the working principles of the effect that we want to probe .        in this sense",
    ", it would be highly desirable to conceive indirect detection strategies providing a faithful picture of the property to test by , for instance , `` copying '' it onto the detection stage , which would then be subjected to a direct estimate process . by focussing on a hybrid optomechanical device comprising an atomic , mechanical and optical mode",
    ", we propose a diagnostic tool for entanglement that operates along the lines of such desiderata .",
    "we show that the entanglement established between the mechanical and optical modes by the means of radiation - pressure coupling can indeed be  written \" into the light - atom subsystem and directly read from it by means of standard , experimentally friendly homodyning .",
    "our analysis goes further to reveal that such a possibility arises from the non - trivial entanglement sharing properties of the system at hand , which is indeed genuinely tripartite entangled .",
    "very interestingly , we find that while any bipartite quantum correlation is bound to disappear at very low temperature , the multipartite content persists longer against the operating conditions , as a result of entanglement monogamy relations .",
    "our analytical characterization considers all the relevant sources of detrimental effects in the system , is explicitly designed to be readily implemented in the lab and provides a first step into the assessment of multipartite entanglement in a macro - scale quantum system of enormous experimental interest .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : model ] we describe the physical system we consider and the equations of motion for the relevant variables . in section [ sec : ent ] we show the results for the stationary entanglement shared by the cavity field , the bec and the optomechanical oscillator . in section [ sec : det ] , we discuss how the entanglement between the three different subsystems can be experimentally measured and , finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we summarize and conclude .",
    "the system we consider , sketched in fig .  [ fig : sketch ] , is made of a cavity where one of the two mirrors is free to move in the direction parallel to the cavity axis . in absence of radiation pressure from the cavity ,",
    "the mirror moves harmonically with a frequency @xmath0 and is at equilibrium at a temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the cavity is pumped through the fixed mirror by a laser of strength @xmath2 and is coupled to an intra - cavity bec .",
    "we assume the latter in the weakly interacting regime  @xcite where we can expand the field operator in a classical part ( representing the condensate wave - function ) and a quantum part representing quantum fluctuations . these are conveniently expressed in terms of bogoliubov modes .",
    "it has been recently shown experimentally  @xcite that the only bogoliubov mode which is significantly coupled to the cavity is the one with momentum @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the cavity mode momentum .",
    "we also assume ultralow temperature of the condensate so that thermal fluctuations are negligible and the bec wave - function is not affected by the coupling to the cavity field .",
    "we write the hamiltonian of the system made of the cavity field , the movable mirror and the bec as @xmath5 where the mirror , cavity and bec hamiltonians are given respectively by @xmath6 here , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the mirror displacement and momentum operators while @xmath9 and @xmath0 are its effective mass and oscillation frequency .",
    "the cavity ( pump laser ) frequency is @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 is the cavity mode annihilation operator .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath13 describes the pumping of the cavity and depends on the laser power @xmath14 and the cavity decay rate @xmath15 .",
    "finally , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the frequency and bosonic annihilation operator of the bogoliubov mode [ cfr . fig  [ fig : sketch ] ] . for small mirror displacements",
    ", the mirror - cavity interaction hamiltonian can be written as  @xcite : @xmath18 it is useful to introduce the quadrature operators for the bogoliubov mode @xmath19 so that the bec - cavity interaction reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the vacuum rabi frequency , @xmath22 is the condensate fraction , @xmath23 is the detuning of the atomic transition from the cavity frequency and the coupling rate @xmath24 depends on the bogoliubov mode - function  @xcite . the same model can be realized with two becs trapped in the same cavity , where the mechanical oscillator is replaced by a second bec .",
    "this setup can be realized straightforwardly as an extension of current experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is also worth stressing that , although our model shares , at first sight , some similarities with the one considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is distinctively different .",
    "first , the atomic media utilized in the two cases are different , with ref",
    ".  @xcite considering the bosonized version of the collective - spin operator of an atomic ensemble .",
    "second , the resulting coupling hamiltonians are built from quite distinct physical mechanisms .",
    "third , the working conditions to be used in the two models in order to achieve interesting structures of shared quantum correlations are very different .",
    "we will comment on this latter point later .    * ( a ) * +       any realistic description of the problem at hand should include the most relevant sources of noise affecting the overall device , that is energy leakage from the cavity and mechanical brownian motion at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting open - system dynamics can be efficiently described by means of a set of langevin equations for the vector of operators @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the position- and momentum - like quadrature operators of the cavity field . under the experimentally reasonable assumption of an intense pumping field",
    ", we expand the relevant operators around the respective classical mean values @xmath27 as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 s are zero - mean fluctuation operators .",
    "the mean values are easily determined by solving the steady - state langevin equations , which readily lead to @xmath30 with @xmath31 ( that also allows us to determine @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) and the effective cavity detuning @xmath34 in the rest of the paper , we will use @xmath35 as a reference parameter , while all the other parameters entering the expression of @xmath35 remain unspecified . at this point of our analysis , it is convenient to define dimensionless position and momentum operators for the mirror as @xmath36 and @xmath37 and cast the langevin equations for the fluctuations into the form @xmath38 where we have defined the vector of fluctuations @xmath39 the noise vector @xmath40 and the coupling matrix @xmath41 that is readily determined following ref .",
    "@xcite and depends on the scaled coupling parameter @xmath42 and the mirror dissipation rate @xmath43 .",
    "the noise vector contains the cavity input - noise operators @xmath44 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , we have introduced the zero - mean langevin force operator @xmath47 responsible for brownian motion of the mechanical system at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "small values of @xmath43 and low operating temperatures allow to retain an effective markovian description of the mechanical brownian motion , where  @xcite @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 being the boltzmann constant .",
    "moreover , we have checked the validity of the first - order expansion of the operators ( which holds only for small quantum fluctuations ) by looking at the stability of the steady - state solution to the langevin equations , which is guaranteed when @xmath51 has all negative eigenvalues . using @xmath35 as a free parameter ,",
    "the solution is stable when @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which implies that the mirror - bec - induced back - action is small compared to the cavity dissipation .",
    "such conditions are met across our work .",
    "we can now address the entanglement - inference scheme that is the focus of our study .",
    "we focus on the @xmath54 regime where any transient in the dynamics of the system has faded away and steady - state quantum correlations are set .",
    "the main tool of our assessment is the covariance matrix of the state of our hybrid system , which is defined as  @xcite @xmath55{=}\\frac 12 \\langle\\ { \\delta\\hat\\phi_i , \\delta\\hat\\phi_j\\}\\rangle{-}\\langle \\delta\\hat\\phi_i\\rangle \\langle \\delta\\hat\\phi_j\\rangle\\ ] ] and contains full information on a gaussian state such as ours .",
    "using the langevin equations one can show that @xmath56 fulfills the equation @xmath57 where @xmath58\\ ] ] and @xmath59 is the thermal mean - occupation number of the mechanical state .",
    "this allows us to find @xmath56 for any values of the relevant parameters .",

    ", @xmath65 is the smallest symplectic eigenvalue of the the matrix @xmath66 , @xmath67 performs momentum - inversion in phase - space and @xmath68 is the reduced covariance matrix of @xmath61 and @xmath62  @xcite .    in the following two subsections ,",
    "we discuss separately the bipartite and the multipartite cases .      here",
    "we analyze the stationary entanglement in the three possible bipartitions of the system .",
    "let us start with the symmetric situation where @xmath69 and where the cavity - mirror coupling equals the cavity - atoms coupling ( @xmath70 . we always restrict ourselves to a stable regime for the linear langevin system . in this case and for very low initial temperature of the mechanical mode ( we take @xmath71k ) , we find that entanglement is generated in the stationary state between the bogoliubov mode and the cavity field as well within the field - mechanical mode subsystem .",
    "due to the symmetric coupling @xmath72 is very similar to @xmath73 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e5](*a - b * ) .",
    "this provides an interesting _ diagnostic tool _ : the inaccessibility of the mirror mode makes the inference of the optomechanical entanglement a hard task needing cleverly designed , although experimentally challenging , indirect methods  @xcite .",
    "however , in light of the recent demonstration of controllability of intra - cavity atomic systems  @xcite , we can think of inferring the pure optomechanical entanglement simply by measuring the more accessible correlations between the optical field and the bogoliubov mode . in the range of parameters considered here ,",
    "the mirror - atoms entanglement @xmath74 is always zero .",
    "this is in contrast with the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the emergence of @xmath74 is due to the use of an effective negative detuning that regulates the free evolution of the collective atomic quadrature . in our case ,",
    "such evolution is ruled by the frequency @xmath16 , which is always positive .",
    "therefore , the two models can access quite different regions of the parameter - space . in turn",
    ", this implies that , while our system does not allow for hybrid atom - mirror entanglement , genes _ et al._in ref .",
    "@xcite did not achieve the symmetric @xmath75 situation revealed above .",
    "we now study how @xmath72 and @xmath73 decay with @xmath1 .",
    "the results plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : e5 ] * ( c ) * show that the two entanglements are indistinguishable and therefore the bec can still be used as an entanglement probe .",
    "as expected the entanglement decays when increasing the environment temperature and disappears for @xmath76mk .",
    "higher critical temperatures for the disappearance of entanglement are found for larger cavity quality factors and more intense pumps .",
    "we consider two different regimes , where we relax the symmetric conditions between the mirror and the bogoliubov mode . in the first situation , we take @xmath77 and vary the coupling rates . in the second ,",
    "we take symmetric couplings @xmath78 and change the frequencies . for @xmath77 , @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    "are strongly affected by the change in @xmath24 and @xmath79 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : entasym1 ] * ( a ) * , @xmath72 grows continuously for larger @xmath24 while @xmath73 decreases slightly .",
    "in this regime , it is clear that small inaccuracies of the ratio @xmath80 do not affect the mirror - cavity entanglement , therefore confirming the role of the bec as a minimal disturbance probe .",
    "a more involved situation occurs when we keep @xmath0 fixed and change @xmath16 .",
    "we take @xmath81k , cavity finesse @xmath82 and find a sharp peak at @xmath69 where @xmath75 , see [ fig .",
    "[ fig : entasym1 ] * ( b ) * ] . while @xmath73 increases slowly with @xmath83 ( the bogoliubov mode goes out of resonance from the cavity and decouples from the rest of the system ) , @xmath72 reaches its maximum at @xmath84 .",
    "these results show that by changing the bogoliubov frequency , for example varying the longitudinal trapping frequency , the bec acts as a switch for the mirror - cavity entanglement , inhibiting or enhancing it .",

    ", we indeed find inseparability of the bipartitions @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : tripartite ] ] , which strongly confirms the presence of tripartite entanglement up to very high temperatures .",
    "evidently , multipartite entanglement persists up to @xmath89k , which is much larger than the critical one for the disappearance of bipartite entanglement ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "such a result spurs the quantitative study of the genuine tripartite - entanglement content of the overall state  @xcite . for pure multipartite states ,",
    "this is based on monogamy inequalities valid for the squared logarithmic negativity , which turns out to be a proper entanglement monotone .",

    "however , for @xmath77 and @xmath96 , the covariance matrix @xmath97 is symmetric under the permutation of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , which greatly simplifies the calculations : the residual tripartite entanglement can be thus determined against the effects of @xmath1 , showing a non monotonic behavior . to understand this ,",
