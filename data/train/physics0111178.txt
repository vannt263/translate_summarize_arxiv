    "in a series of experiments @xcite , a nonuniform bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of @xmath0li atoms was formed and proved metastable for atom numbers @xmath1 with @xmath2 , in agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite . due to attraction between atoms ,",
    "such condensate is bound to collapse when @xmath3 , but it may collapse also for @xmath1 via quantum or thermal tunneling . within the mean - field appraoch , bec is described by one wave function .",
    "our aim in this work was to find the exact mean - field description of the quantum tunneling in this simplest conceivable many - body system .",
    "our additional motivation is the recently demonstarted ability to control the interaction of @xmath4rb atoms in bec @xcite , which opens a new perspective to systematic experimental checks on quantum tunneling .    up to now , studies of the quantum tunneling of bec relied on assuming gaussian wave functions @xcite , at least in assigning the mass parameter @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , once the mean field equation is specified , there is no place for such an assumption : this equation , taking a form of the nonlinear field equation , by itself determines the dynamics . to find solutions",
    "which correspond to quantum decay we use the method of instantons , i.e. fields evolving in imaginary time @xcite , carried over to mean - field theories of many - body systems @xcite .",
    "it gives the decay rate @xmath5 , with the exponent @xmath6 being the action for the optimal mean - field instanton , called bounce .",
    "we find the exact instantons for spherical bec by first transforming the original imaginary - time mean - field equation to an equation for the condensate density , and then solving it numerically . having done that wa can check the gaussian ansatz .",
    "the real - time version of the obtained equation encompasses finite amplitude collective radial oscillations of bec .",
    "applying quantization rule we find energies of radial eigenmodes . by using imaginary - time dynamics",
    "we also find periodic instantons determining decay exponents of these breathing modes . in this way",
    ", the collective dynamics of an attractive spherical condensate close to instability is obtained from the mean field equation .",
    "we assume that the dynamics of bec is governed by the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the static trap potential and @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the s - wave scattering length and @xmath11 the atomic mass .",
    "the wave function is normalized as @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the total number of atoms in the condensate .    in the present work we consider a harmonic , spherically symmetric trap @xmath14 .",
    "this suggests choosing @xmath15 as the unit of length , @xmath16 as the unit of time and @xmath17 as the unit of energy .",
    "we also change the normalization of the wave function to unity , @xmath18 . to simplify equations we work with the function @xmath19 , for which the gpe reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 , and the generalised density @xmath22 .",
    "for a stationary state , @xmath23 , @xmath24 being the single - particle energy or chemical potential .",
    "for each @xmath25 there are two stationary states , one metastable and another unstable , at the top of the energy barrier @xcite ( cf fig .",
    "quantum tunneling of bec is described by a specific solution to the equation @xmath26 obtained from ( [ gp1 ] ) by a transition to imaginary time , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "now , the density @xmath28 as @xmath29 is replaced by @xmath30 upon @xmath27 .",
    "this makes eq.([eqsp ] ) nonlocal in time .",
    "bounce has to satisfy the boundary conditions of 1 ) periodicity , @xmath31 , with @xmath32 the amplitude of the metastable state , and 2 ) barrier penetration , i.e. @xmath33 has to be some state of bec at the other side of the potential barrier .",
    "( [ eqsp ] ) preserves both the normalization @xmath34 and the energy @xmath35 with @xmath36 the energy of the metastable state . for a bounce starting from the metastable state the period @xmath37 extends to infinity @xcite .",
    "the decay exponent reads @xcite @xmath38 since eq.([eqsp ] ) is real and the boundary value @xmath39 may be taken real , we assume real @xmath40 in the following .",
    "now the point is to transform the nonlocal in time instanton equation ( [ eqsp ] ) into an evolution equation for the condensate density .",
    "a transformation of the real - time gpe ( [ gp1 ] ) to a fluid - dynamic form provides an analogy , but is conceptually simpler .",
    "the bounce equation ( [ eqsp ] ) , with the boundary conditions specified above , splits into two time - local equations for the time - even density @xmath41 and the time - odd current @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44   = 0 , \\ ] ] where the kinetic energy density @xmath45/\\rho$ ] .",
    "when @xmath41 is non - negative ( which is very plausible in the present case , but not granted in general as @xmath46 not @xmath47 ) , one can define a regular , time - odd function @xmath48 which allows decomposition @xmath49 . from this , the fluid - dynamic representation of ( [ eqsp ] ) follows , with the velocity field @xmath50 .",
    "however , even for arbitrary @xmath41 , one can eliminate @xmath51 from eqs.([roj1],[roj2 ] ) , which is more convenient .",
    "introducing @xmath52 , so that @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we automatically fulfil ( [ roj1 ] ) , and ( [ roj2 ] ) transforms to the equation for the primitive of the bounce density , basic for the imaginary - time dynamics of spherical bec - s : @xmath55   = 0   .\\ ] ] notice , that the finite amplitude oscillations of bec around the metastable minimum are described by the real - time version of eq.([bou ] ) , in which @xmath56 and @xmath57 are replaced by @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "an alternative , global approach to quantum tunneling is to look for a minimum of action ( [ s ] ) under the condition of constant energy ( [ mhf ] ) and norm . indeed , for a regular @xmath60 , i.e. positive @xmath41 , @xmath61 .",
    "using eq.([mhf ] ) and introducing an observable @xmath62 uniquely labelling states along the barrier , explicitly @xmath63 , we obtain the following functional @xmath64=2 n\\int_{q(0)}^{q(\\tau_p/2 ) } dq \\sqrt{2 b(q ) ( v(q)-{\\cal e})}\\ ] ] which is minimized by the primitive of the bounce density ( note , that @xmath65 for bec ) .",
    "the potential energy @xmath66 $ ] , @xmath67=4\\pi\\int_0^{\\infty } dr[\\frac{(\\partial_r\\rho)^2}{8\\rho}+\\frac{1}{2}\\rho r^2+\\frac{k\\rho^2}{2 r^2}]\\ ] ] and the effective mass parameter @xmath68 $ ] @xmath69 are both the functionals of @xmath70 .",
    "note that eq.([func ] ) is invariant with respect to a change of the controlling variable , as for any other such variable @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "the energy conservation ( [ mhf ] ) implies that for bounce @xmath73 , with @xmath74 , and therefore @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "we have solved eq.([bou ] ) using the variable @xmath62 rather than @xmath76 .",
    "an initial sequence of densities @xmath77 , with 30 - 50 @xmath78 points covering the barrier region , was constructed by minimizing @xmath79 $ ] ( [ v ] ) under the constraint @xmath80 .",
    "these constrained stationary densities were then improved upon iteratively .",
    "the details of @xmath81 , the counterpart of @xmath82 of eq .",
    "( [ eqgp ] ) , are obtained more precisely when the @xmath83 behaviour near @xmath84 and the harmonic oscillator asymptotics at infinity are factored out in eq.([bou ] ) . in numerical work ,",
    "we use a function @xmath85 such that @xmath86 , and properly express the term @xmath87 - see _ appendix_.",
    "we also performed the minimization of the functional ( [ func ] ) treating @xmath88 as independent variables .",
    "it turns out that @xmath89 thus obtained do not fulfil eq.([bou ] ) accurately , but the accuracy in @xmath6 is better than 0.1% .",
    "the numerical results have been obtained with physical data on @xmath0li adopted after the most accurate treatment up to date @xcite .",
    "these values give @xmath90 , and we obtain the critical value @xmath91 between 7.2249 and 7.2255 ( @xmath92 between 1258.7 and 1258.8 ) .",
    "the potential energy @xmath93 from the bounce solutions ( fig.1 ) , nearly identical with @xmath94 $ ] for constrained stationary @xmath77 , is very flat between @xmath95 and @xmath96 for @xmath97 . for smaller @xmath13",
    ", it becomes quite peaked around the summit , and its fall on the side of small @xmath62 becomes very steep .",
    "all the obtained bounce solutions result from the small adjustment of the initial densities . for larger @xmath98 ( and increasing @xmath99 and @xmath100 terms , cf eq.([edyn ] ) ) this adjustment becomes gradually more difficult .",
    "we could not obtain the exact solution of eq.([bou ] ) ( or even a constrained stationary @xmath77 for small @xmath78 ) for @xmath101 .",
    "the mass parameters @xmath102 from various instanton solutions ( fig.2 ) are nearly identical which shows that there exists a universal inertia for the radial collective motion of bec close to instability .",
    "this may be understood as a consequence of a nearly static character of solutions @xmath103 in the limited range of @xmath104 values of interest : @xmath70 depends weakly on @xmath13 close to critical @xmath92 .    for a gaussian density with a variable width @xmath105 , @xmath106 , the current @xmath107 ( eq.([roj1 ] ) ) , and the mass parameter @xmath108 ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "hence , as for the gaussian density @xmath109 , one has @xmath110 , as used in ref.@xcite . as seen in fig.2 , this is a fair assumption near the metastable minima , much worse though for smaller @xmath62 around the barrier s summit . the error in @xmath6 due to the gaussian value of @xmath111 amounts to 3 - 4% in the cases studied .",
    "the bounce `` amplitude '' , @xmath112 ( fig.3 ) , differs from the constrained stationary values @xmath113 mostly near @xmath84 and for small @xmath62 , by up to 1% .",
    "decay exponents calculated with the initial densities @xmath77 are only up to 0.3% larger than the exact ones .",
    "next we turn to collective radial oscillations of bec and their decay rates .",
    "quantum tunneling from the excited state with energy @xmath114 may be treated by solving eq.([bou ] ) as before , except that now the period @xmath37 must be finite and @xmath115 replaced by @xmath116 .",
    "one has to fix the boundary values @xmath117 and the energies @xmath114 .",
    "the energies @xmath118 of the excited quantum states follow from the quantization condition @xmath119 @xcite , where @xmath120 , cf eq.([func ] ) , with the period @xmath121 depending on @xmath118 .",
    "essentially , the imaginary - time boundary value @xmath117 should match the real - time oscillatory solution @xmath122 at the turning point @xmath62 at which @xmath123 .",
    "we could not solve the real - time version of eq.([bou ] ) as accurately as for instantons .",
    "however , since the action @xmath6 is insensitive to the details of solution , the lowest quantized @xmath118 are quite accurate .",
    "their comparison to frequencies of the small amplitude oscillations , obtained from the gpe linearized around @xmath124 ( so called bogolyubov spectrum , see @xcite ) , is interesting .",
    "the first radial excitation , @xmath125 , is nearly equal , but little smaller than , the lowest bogolyubov mode corresponding to the small amplitude limit , except that it may not exist for a too shallow @xmath93 , like for @xmath126 .",
    "the higher modes , @xmath118 , @xmath127 , come out roughly at the multiples of @xmath125 ( table 1 ) , and thus represent nearly harmonic spectrum of collective radial oscillations .",
    "its @xmath128 states are lower than the second bogolyubov mode , lying slightly above @xmath129 .    using the quantized oscillation energies we have found periodic instantons and calculated decay exponents for some low collective radial excitations .",
    "such instanton with a period @xmath37 is quite similar to the so - called `` thermon '' which describes thermal decay from the metastable ground state at the temperature @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "this similarity is easily understood : thermal decay goes via thermal excitation of quantum states above the metastable ground state and successive tunneling from them through the smaller barrier . at higher temperatures , details of the excitation spectrum and tunneling",
    "become irrelevant and the thermal tunneling rate @xmath131 , with @xmath132 the barrier energy , replaces a thermal mixture of rates @xmath133 from a few lowest excited states at small temperature .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath134 at which this happens is usually determined as the one at which @xmath135 .",
    "numerical results are collected in table 1 .",
    "those in columns 2 - 4 depend only on @xmath136 and relate to all bec - s with attractive interaction .",
    "decay rates @xmath137 from the metastable @xmath0li bec were calculated for @xmath138 s@xmath139 @xcite , assuming prefactor @xmath140 @xcite , with @xmath141 from the small amplitude limit .",
    "the exact prefactor is difficult to calculate , but it must be of the same order as in table 1 . obtained values of @xmath137 are very close to those of ref.@xcite , where the effect of too small @xmath111-s is fortuitously reduced by half by the interpolation overestimating @xmath93 .",
    "the decrease of the decay exponents @xmath142 with the mode number @xmath143 and their comparison to exponents @xmath6 for the ground state are seen in table 1 , col .",
    "5 . for example",
    ", quantum decay of the @xmath144 radial mode in bec with @xmath145 is nearly as quick as for the ground state of the @xmath126 bec .",
    "the crossover temperature @xmath134 at which the thermal decay begins to dominate over the quantum tunneling is approximated , neglecting prefactors , as @xmath146 , with @xmath132 the barrier energy , @xmath36 for the metastable state , and @xmath147 for the excited state . for the latter ,",
    "the meaning of critical temperature is extended in analogy with that for the ground state : suppose the condensate in the oscillation state @xmath143 and ask at which temperature @xmath148 the thermal rate exponent equals the instanton action @xmath142 .",
    "these ratios ( table 1 , column 3 ) show that for presently measurable @xmath137 and @xmath138 s@xmath139 , corresponding to @xmath149 nk , @xmath150nk , both for ground state and collective radial oscillations .",
    "we notice , that for all finite-@xmath37 instantons describing decay out of the @xmath151th collective radial excitation , @xmath152 so , at their own thermon `` temperature '' , they dominate over the thermal decay .",
    "the quantity @xmath153 ( table 1 , column 4 ) shows @xmath154 behaviour close to @xmath92 , with @xmath155 @xcite . for larger @xmath98",
    "the effective exponent slightly decreases to @xmath156 .",
    "consider now two different attractive bec - s with critical particle numbers @xmath92 and @xmath157 .",
    "the same decay exponent @xmath6 is obtained for such ( not too large ) @xmath98 and @xmath158 which satisfy the relation @xmath159 , with @xmath160 .",
    "thus , e.g. we obtain @xmath161 for @xmath162 in bec with @xmath163 , and for @xmath164 in bec with @xmath165 , cf table 1 .    in summary ,",
    "the equations for the condensate density , describing both the real- and imaginary - time dynamics of spherical bec , were formulated and the exact instanton solutions were found numerically , also for collective radial excitations .",
    "the determined mass parameter ( fig .",
    "2 ) deviates from the gaussian ansatz , but the calculated decay exponents for the metastable states agree well with ref.@xcite .",
    "it follows from fig.2 that the exact mass parametr may be more relevant to the behind - the - barrier collapse phase , i.e for smaller @xmath62 .",
    "the quantized energies of collective finite amplitude radial vibrations form nearly harmonic ( slightly compressed ) spectrum with @xmath166 , where @xmath141 is slightly lower than the lowest bogolyubov mode .",
    "the @xmath128 collective oscillation states lie lower than the second bogolyubov mode .",
    "any excitation ( thermal or otherwise , e.g. by modulation of the trapping oscillator frequancy ) of these collective vibrations must lead to a faster decay of the condensate , as the table 1 shows .",
    "if quantum tunneling is not to be overshadowed by thermal decay , the experiments should proceed at low @xmath167 and/or large @xmath168 .",
    "since theoretical results are more certain away from @xmath92 , where the exponent @xmath6 dominates decay , one should probe a range of moderate @xmath6 , giving observable , but not too large @xmath137 ( perhaps , by discarding prompt collapses ) .",
    "the corresponding range of @xmath98 values depends on @xmath92 as @xmath169 .",
    "we have @xmath170 with @xmath171 .",
    "the stationary gpe leads to the equation for @xmath172 @xmath173 with @xmath174 . for large @xmath175 , @xmath176 @xcite .",
    "the normalization of @xmath177 implies the next two terms @xmath178 a solution regular at @xmath179 must fulfil @xmath180 these boundary conditions suggest a method of solution : for a given @xmath136 we assume some @xmath24 and @xmath181 and , starting from the asymptotic values ( [ eas ] ) at large @xmath175 , integrate eq.([estat ] ) to @xmath179 .",
    "we check eq.([eor ] ) and the normalization and correct @xmath24 and @xmath181 until we fulfil both .    by using a new variable @xmath182 and factoring out @xmath183 , we transform eq.([bou ] ) to a form @xmath184)= \\frac{\\partial r}{\\partial s } , \\ ] ] suitable for both instantons and oscillations if @xmath185 is understood",

    "we solve ( [ edyn ] ) as the ordinary differential equation in @xmath175 to obtain new @xmath189 .",
    "the method , as for the stationary case , is to adjust the asympotic form ( [ eas ] ) to the proper regularity condition at @xmath179 .",
    "the new and old @xmath191-s are combined to provide initial @xmath191-s for the next iteration . with a careful modification of @xmath191-s",
