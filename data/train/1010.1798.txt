    "galaxy clusters are the largest collapsed objects in the universe , making them excellent tools for studying cosmology and the astrophysics of gravitational collapse .",
    "they are rare excursions in the matter density field and the formation history of clusters is closely tied to the composition and evolution of the universe . as a consequence , clusters have been used extensively to constrain cosmology .",
    "for example , they provided the first evidence that the matter density , @xmath11 , was insufficient to close the universe @xcite .",
    "additionally , clusters provided the most reliable information about the amplitude of scalar perturbations , @xmath12 , prior to the release of wmap results @xcite .",
    "moreover , the cluster - derived measurements of @xmath12 can be combined with measurements of the normalization of the cmb power spectrum to constrain the total neutrino mass via the growth of density perturbations @xcite .",
    "in addition , galaxy clusters have been forming during the same epoch that dark energy has evolved to dominate the energy density the universe . as a result ,",
    "the number of galaxy clusters as a function of redshift is sensitive to the dark energy density , @xmath13 , and its equation of state , @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "recently , large surveys of galaxy clusters have been completed , or have released initial results , that constrain the total neutrino mass and/or the properties of dark energy @xcite .",
    "additionally , clusters are being used to test gravity on large scales via studies of their internal structure and distribution in space .",
    "galaxy clusters also provide excellent laboratories for studying the astrophysics of structure formation .",
    "in general , galaxy clusters are well - behaved objects , and their properties can be predicted to fairly good precision using simple gravitational collapse models and self - similar scaling relations  @xcite .",
    "however , non - gravitational effects , such as radiative cooling , star formation , turbulence , magnetic field support , and cosmic ray pressure produce deviations from the simple gravitational models , and the data clearly favor models that include non - gravitational processes  @xcite .    a wide range of observational techniques are used to study galaxy clusters . optical / infrared and radio measurements can be used to study the individual galaxies within the cluster ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) ; parameters such as velocity dispersion and richness can then be used to understand the global properties of the cluster(_e.g .",
    "_ , @xcite )",
    ". additionally , x - ray observations are sensitive to the bremsstrahlung emission from the hot gas in the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) , which contains @xmath15% of the baryonic mass of the cluster ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "galaxy clusters are also efficient gravitational lenses , and detailed observations of the background galaxies can be used to determine the matter distribution within the cluster , @xmath15% of which is in the form of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "the icm can also be studied using the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect  @xcite , where the background cmb photons inverse compton scatter off of the electrons in the icm .",
    "studies of galaxy clusters using the sz effect are quickly maturing .",
    "the south pole telescope ( spt ) and the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) are conducting large untargeted surveys and have already published catalogues with dozens of clusters  ; they expect to detect hundreds of clusters when the surveys are complete .",
    "due to the redshift independence of the sz surface brightness , the clusters discovered in these surveys are , on average , at significantly higher redshifts than those discovered with x - ray or optical surveys .",
    "consequently , sz - selected cluster catalogues are expected to play a leading role in further constraining cosmological parameters such as @xmath16 and @xmath14 ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "these large - scale sz surveys are operating based on the prediction that the total integrated sz signal over the cluster , @xmath17 , which is proportional to the total thermal energy of the icm , scales in a robust way with total cluster mass ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) . in practice",
    ", the integral does not generally extend to the edge of the cluster , which is effectively at @xmath18 , and can be be performed in one of two ways : over a spherical volume using a deprojected sz profile or over a cylindrical volume using a projected sz profile .",
    "most groups have calculated the integrated sz signal by performing the cylindrical integration over the cluster face within a well defined aperture ( generally @xmath19 or @xmath5 )  @xcite , although a couple groups have also performed the spherical integral  @xcite . with the exception of (",
    "* hereafter p10 ) , these groups have exclusively used parametric profiles to describe the sz signal in order to determine @xmath17 .",
    "the initial scaling results from these @xmath17 measurements are roughly consistent with the expectation that it is a low - scatter ( @xmath2% ) proxy for the total cluster mass .",
    "additionally , several groups have made detailed sz observations of previously known galaxy clusters , and these data have been used to constrain the properties of the icm beyond @xmath5  .",
    "for example , the spt has measured radial profiles in 15 clusters to a significant fraction of the virial radius , and they find best - fit model parameters that are consistent with previous studies using x - ray data  p10 .",
    "apex - sz has published detailed studies of three clusters , using a joint sz / x - ray analysis to constrain mass - weighted temperature profiles beyond @xmath5 in two of these clusters  @xcite .",
    "note that , in addition to providing complementary information about the icm in these previously studied clusters , these sz data will help constrain and improve systematic uncertainties in blind sz surveys ( _ e.g. _ , constraining the typical sz profiles and resulting detection biases due to the cooling properties of the central gas @xcite ) .    high resolution ( @xmath2  arcsec ) sz measurements are also now being made using mustang  @xcite and sza / carma  @xcite .",
    "these observations will provide insights on the internal structure of clusters that will be complementary to the information obtained via x - ray observations . among other applications ,",
    "these data can be used , in combination with optical observations , to infer the merging history and evolution of the cluster @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present bolocam sz observations of five massive galaxy clusters .",
    "we are able to measure sz signal in our two - dimensional images to @xmath20 and to well beyond @xmath5 in azimuthally averaged radial profiles . using these data",
    ", we are able to constrain the broad morphologies of these clusters and compute observables such as @xmath21 in a model - independent way . a companion paper to this manuscript , @xcite , presents joint x - ray / sz deprojections of density and temperature profiles for these same five clusters using bolocam and _ chandra _ data @xcite .",
    "bolocam is a mm - wave imaging camera that operates from the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) with 144 bolometric detectors covering a circular 8  arcmin field of view ( fov )  @xcite . for the observations described in this manuscript ,",
    "bolocam was configured to observe at 143  ghz . to image the clusters",
    ", we scanned the telescope in a lissajous pattern  @xcite , where the telescope is driven in two orthogonal directions using sine waves with incommensurate periods .",
    "we used an amplitude of 4  arcmin for the sinusoids , which were oriented along the ra and dec directions with periods of 6.28 and 8.89  sec .",
    "these parameters were chosen to keep the fov on the cluster center 100% of the time while scanning as fast as possible at the cso ( @xmath22 arcmin / sec ) to modulate the cluster signal above the low - frequency atmospheric noise .",
    "an example of the resulting integration time per pixel is given in figure  [ fig : coverage ] .",
    "the data were collected via 10-minute - long observations , with the periods of the two orthogonal sinusoids exchanged between observations .",
    "typically , we complete @xmath23 observations per cluster , which corresponds to approximately 50  ksec and yields a beam - smoothed rms of @xmath2  @xmath3k@xmath4  ( see table  [ tab : clusters ] ) .",

    "in general , our data reduction followed the procedure described in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter s09 ) , with some minor modifications .",
    "we briefly describe the techniques below , along with the changes relative to s09 .",
    "bright quasars located near the clusters were observed for @xmath45  minutes once every @xmath15 minutes in order to determine the offset of our focal plane relative to the telescope pointing coordinates .",
    "these observations were used to construct a model of the pointing offset as a function of local coordinates ( az , el ) , with a single model for each cluster .",
    "the uncertainty in the pointing models is @xmath46  arcsec .",
    "this pointing uncertainty is quasi - negligible for bolocam s 58  arcsec fwhm beams , especially for extended objects such as clusters .",
    "we made two 20-minute - long observations each night of uranus , neptune , or a source in @xcite for flux calibration . using the quiescent detector resistance as a proxy for detector responsivity and atmospheric transmission",
    ", we then fit a single flux - calibration curve to the entire data set .",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in our flux calibration to be 4.3% , with the following breakdown : 1.7% from the rudy temperature model of mars scaled to measured wmap values  @xcite , 1.5% in the uranus / neptune model referenced to mars  @xcite , 1.4% due to variations in atmospheric opacity  ( s09 ) , 3.1% due to uncertainties in the solid angle of our point - spread function ( psf )  ( s09 ) , and 1.5% due to measurement uncertainties  ( s09 ) .",
    "the raw bolocam timestreams are dominated by noise sourced by fluctuations in the water vapor in the atmosphere , which have a power spectrum that rises sharply at low frequencies . in order to optimally",
    "subtract the atmospheric noise , we have used a slightly modified version of the average subtraction algorithm described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter s10 ) .",
    "we have modified the s10 algorithm because these cluster data contain additional atmospheric noise caused by the lissajous scan pattern .",
    "since we are scanning the telescope parallel to ra and dec , the airmass we are looking through is constantly changing . as a result ,",
    "our data contain a large amount of atmospheric signal in narrow bands centered on the two fundamental scan frequencies .",
    "following the algorithm in s10 , we first create a template of the atmosphere by averaging the signal from all of our detectors at each time sample ( _ i.e. _ , the average signal over the fov ) . in s10 , this template is subtracted from each detector s timestream after weighting it by the relative gain of that detector , which is determined from the correlation coefficient between the timestream and the template .",
    "we use a single correlation coefficient for each detector for each 10-minute - long observation .",
    "however , a significant fraction of the atmospheric noise at the fundamental scan frequencies remains in the data after application of the s10 algorithm , indicating that we have slightly misestimated the correlation coefficients .",
    "therefore , we modified the s10 algorithm to compute the correlation coefficients for the template based only on the data within a narrow band centered on the two fundamental scan frequencies .",
    "the atmospheric noise power in these narrow frequency bands is roughly an order of magnitude above the broadband atmospheric noise at nearby frequencies ; consequently , the data in these narrow bands provide a high signal - to - noise estimate of each detector s response to atmospheric signal .",
    "the narrowband atmospheric noise features are completely removed using this modified s10 algorithm , and the amount of residual broadband atmospheric noise is slightly reduced compared to the results from the original s10 algorithm .    after applying this average subtraction algorithm to the timestream data , we then high - pass filter the data according to @xmath47 with @xmath48  mhz and @xmath49 .",
    "the value of @xmath50 was chosen to maximize the spatially - extended s / n for the typical cluster in our sample based on tests with @xmath50 varying from 0 to 400  mhz , and the value of @xmath51 was chosen to produce a sharp cutoff with minimal ringing .",
    "figure  [ fig : psd ] shows a typical pre and post - subtraction timestream noise psd .",
    "in addition to subtracting atmospheric noise , the fov - average subtraction and timestream high - pass filter also remove some cluster signal .",
    "since we use the data timestreams to both determine the atmospheric fluctuation template and the correlation coefficient of each detector s data timestream with the template , the fov - average subtraction acts on the data in a non - linear way . consequently , its impact on the data depends on the cluster signal .",
    "as described below , we quantify the effects of the fov - average subtraction and the timestream high - pass filter via simulation by processing a known cluster image through our data - reduction pipeline .",
    "these simulations are computation - time intensive , and we find , in practice ( see section  [ sec : tests_model ] ) , that the filtering is only mildly dependent on the cluster signal .",
    "thus , in the end , we determine the effects of the filtering for a particular cluster s data set using the cluster model that best fits those data .",
    "we use the term transfer function to describe the effect of the filtering , although this terminology is not rigorously correct because the filtering depends in the cluster signal .    to compute the transfer function , we first insert a simulated , beam - smoothed cluster profile into our data timestreams by reverse mapping it using our pointing information .",
    "these data are then processed in an identical way to the original data , and an output image , or map , is produced . when processing the data - plus - simulated - cluster timestreams we use the fov - average subtraction correlation coefficients that were determined for the original data .",
    "this ensures that the simulated cluster is processed in an identical way to the real cluster in our data . in the limit that the best - fit cluster model is an accurate description of the data , this process is rigorously correct .",
    "the original data map is then subtracted from this data - plus - simulated - cluster map to produce a noise - free image of the processed cluster . in figure",
    "[ fig : xfer ] , we show an example cluster image , along with the noise - free processed image of the same cluster .",
    "the fourier transform of this processed cluster image is divided by the fourier transform of the input cluster to determine how the cluster is filtered as a function of 2-dimensional fourier mode ( _ i.e. _ , what we term the transfer function , see figure  [ fig : xfer2 ] ) .    at small angular scales , there is very little signal in the beam - smoothed input cluster , and numerical noise prevents us from accurately characterizing the transfer function at these scales .",
    "the transfer function is expected to be unity at small angular scales , and is asymptoting to this value at the larger scales where we can accurately characterize it .",
    "therefore , we set the transfer function to a value of 1 for @xmath52  arcmin@xmath53 .",
    "deconvolving the processed cluster image using the transfer function ( see section  [ sec : images ] ) , which has been approximated as 1 at small angular scales , produces an image that is slightly biased compared to the input cluster .",
    "the residuals between these two images are approximately white , with an rms of @xmath54  @xmath3k@xmath4 .",
    "this transfer - function - induced bias is negligible compared to our noise , which has an rms of @xmath2  @xmath3k@xmath4 .    as noted above , the transfer function ( weakly )",
    "depends on the profile of the cluster ; larger clusters are more heavily filtered than smaller clusters .",
    "therefore , we determine a unique transfer function for each cluster using the best - fit elliptical nagai model for that cluster  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter n07 ) .",
    "the details of this fit are given in section  [ sec : cluster_model ] .",
    "since the transfer function depends on the best - fit model , and vice versa , we determine the best - fit model and transfer function in an iterative way . starting with a generic cluster profile , we first determine a transfer function , and then fit an elliptical nagai model using this transfer function ( _ i.e. _ , the nagai model parameters are varied while the transfer function is held fixed ) .",
    "this process is repeated , using the best - fit model from the previous iteration to calculate the transfer function , until the best - fit model parameters stabilize .",
    "this process converges fairly quickly , usually after a single iteration for the clusters in our sample .",
    "the model dependence of the resulting transfer function is quantified in section  [ sec : tests_model ] .      in order to accurately characterize the sensitivity of our images",
    ", we compute our map - space noise directly from the data via 1000 jackknife realizations of our cluster images . in each realization ,",
    "random subsets of half of the @xmath23 observations are multiplied by @xmath55 prior to adding them into the map .",
    "each jackknife preserves the noise properties of the map while removing all of the astronomical signal , along with any possible fixed - pattern or scan - synchronous noise due to the telescope scanning motion . ] .",
    "since these jackknife realizations remove all astronomical signal , we estimate the amount of astronomical noise in our images separately , as described below . after normalizing the noise estimate of each map pixel in each jackknife by the square root of the integration time in that pixel",
    ", we construct a sensitivity histogram , in @xmath3k@xmath4-s@xmath56 , from the ensemble of map pixels in all 1000 jackknifes .",
    "the width of this histogram provides an accurate estimate of our map - space sensitivity ( see figure  [ fig : sens_hist ] ) .",
    "we then assume that the noise covariance matrix is diagonal .",
    "note that the approximation fails for our deconvolved images ( see section  [ sec : images ] ) , which contain a non - negligible amount of correlated noise .",
    "we describe how this correlated noise is accounted for in our results in section  [ sec : images ] . ] and divide by the square root of the integration time in each map pixel to determine the noise rms in that pixel .",
    "this method is analogous to the one used in s09 , where it is described in more detail .",
    "there is a non - negligible amount of noise in our maps from two main types of astronomical sources : anisotropies in the cmb and unresolved point sources .",
    "the south pole telescope ( spt ) has recently published power spectra for both of these sources at 150  ghz over the range of angular scales probed by our maps , so we use their measurements to estimate the astronomical noise in our maps  @xcite .",
    "note that these measurements inherently include all astrophysical effects , such as lensing and clustering of point sources . using the spt power spectra",
    ", we generate simulated maps of our cluster fields assuming gaussian fluctuations .",
    "note that this is a poor assumption for both the sz - sourced cmb fluctuations and the signal sourced by background galaxies that are lensed by the cluster .",
    "however , since the noise power from both of these sources is quasi - negligible compared to the total noise in our images , any failure of our gaussian assumption will have a minimal impact on our results .",
    "the good match of the sds1 data to our noise model validates our gaussian assumption ( see figure  [ fig : sens_hist ] ) .",
    "these simulated images of the cmb plus point sources are then reverse mapped into our timestream data and processed to estimate how they will appear in our cluster maps .",
    "we then add these processed astronomical realizations to our jackknife realizations to provide a complete estimate of the noise in our images .",
    "sensitivity estimates from our signal - free map of sds1 agree well with the sensitivity estimates from our noise maps , indicating that there are no additional noise sources that have not been included in our estimate ( see figure  [ fig : sens_hist ] ) .",
    "the properties of this noise are described in more detail in section  [ sec : tests_noise ] . in general ,",
    "the noise from astronomical sources is quasi - negligible compared to the other noise in our images .",
    "however , the large - scale correlations from cmb fluctuations are non - negligible in our deconvolved images ( see table  [ tab : y_sz ] ) .",
    "note that we have chosen to model the signal from point sources as an additional noise term in our maps rather than attempting to subtract any individual point sources .",
    "part of the motivation for this approach is the fact that we do not detect any point sources in our cluster or blank - field images . for reference",
    ", p10 mapped 15 clusters to a similar depth using the spt and only detected two point sources ; the combined area of the spt images is approximately 20 times the combined area of our 6 images .",
    "although there are several known smgs and agns in our images  @xcite , even the brightest sources will have a flux of @xmath2  @xmath3k@xmath4  in our observing band , rendering them undetectable given our noise rms of @xmath2  @xmath3k@xmath4 .",
    "additionally , it is not possible to reliably estimate the flux of these sources in our observing band since most have only been detected at one or two wavelengths , generally separated from our observing band by more than a factor of 2 in wavelength .",
    "as mentioned above , the sz effect involves cmb photons inverse compton scattering off of hot electrons in the icm .",
    "since the electrons are many orders of magnitude hotter than the cmb photons , there is , on average , a net increase in the energy of the photons .",
    "the classical distortion relative to the blackbody spectrum of the cmb is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "the magnitude of the distortion is proportional to the product of the density and temperature of the electrons in the icm projected along the line of sight .",
    "the frequency - dependent temperature change of the cmb is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the density and temperature of the icm electrons .",
    "relativistic corrections can be included by multiplying @xmath63 by @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "note that the x - ray brightness of the icm is proportional to @xmath65 ; the differing density and temperature dependence of the sz and x - ray signals makes them highly complementary probes of the icm  ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite , hereafter b06 ) .",
    "we have fit our data to two types of models : an isothermal beta model  @xcite and the pressure profile proposed by n07 , hereafter the nagai profile .",
    "the isothermal beta model has been used extensively to describe x - ray and sz measurements of the icm , and our beta model fit parameters can be directly compared to these previous results .",
    "however , the beta model provides a poor description of deep x - ray data , which generally have a cuspier core and steeper outer profile ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite , n07 , and @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the nagai pressure profile , which is a generalization of the nfw dark matter profile , is able to describe deep x - ray observations over a wide range of scales ( n07 , @xcite ) . therefore , we have also fit our data to the nagai model . in practice",
    ", the beta and nagai models are highly degenerate over the range of angular scales to which our data are sensitive ( @xmath66  arcmin ) .",
    "specifically , the isothermal beta model is described by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the pressure profile , @xmath69 is the pressure normalization , @xmath70 is the core radius , and @xmath71 is the power law slope .",
    "the beta model can be analytically integrated along the line of sight to give the observed sz signal , with @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the sz signal in our map ( in @xmath3k@xmath4 ) and @xmath74 is the central comptonization .",
    "we fix the value of @xmath71 at 0.86 for all of our fits ; this is the best - fit value found in p10 for sz data is larger than those generally found from x - ray data , in agreement with simulations  @xcite .",
    "additionally , it suggests that the icm temperature is falling with increasing radius , in agreement with simulations and data ( _ e.g. _ , n07 ) . ] . since our data timestreams are high - pass filtered , we are not sensitive to the dc signal level in our images .",
    "note that because the timestream data , rather than the map , are high - pass filtered , the dc signal level of the map is in general not equal to 0 .",
    "however , the dc signal of the map is not physically meaningful due to the filtering and must therefore be included as a free parameter , @xmath75 , in the model fits .",
    "we have also generalized the beta model to be elliptical in the plane of the sky with @xmath76 where @xmath77 is oriented along the major axis , described by a position angle of @xmath78 ( in degrees east of north ) , @xmath79 is orthogonal to the major axis , and @xmath80 is the ellipticity .",
    "the nagai model is described by @xmath81^{(\\mathcal{b }        -\\mathcal{c})/\\mathcal{a}}},\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the pressure , @xmath69 is the pressure normalization , @xmath82 is the scale radius ( @xmath83 , with @xmath84  @xcite ) , and @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are the power law slopes at intermediate , large , and small radii compared to @xmath82 .",
    "we have fixed the values of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 to the best - fit values found in @xcite ( 1.05,5.49,0.31 ) .",
    "the nagai model is not analytically integrable , so we numerically integrate @xmath68 along the line of sight to determine @xmath73 .",
    "we have also generalized the nagai model to be elliptical in the plane of the sky , using the same notation as our elliptical generalization of the beta model .",
    "note that , in all of our fits , we have corrected for relativistic effects via the approximations given in @xcite using gas temperature estimates from x - ray observations of these clusters  @xcite .",
    "the relativistic corrections are @xmath88% for the typical temperatures in these massive clusters ( @xmath2  kev ) .",
    "we find that both the beta model and the nagai model adequately describe our data , with the exception of abell 697 , and neither model is preferred with any significance .",
    "however , the elliptical models ( @xmath89/dof @xmath90 ) provide a much better fit to the full ensemble of our cluster data compared to the spherical models ( @xmath89/dof @xmath91 , see tables  [ tab : nagai_model ] and [ tab : beta_model ] ) .",
    "the @xmath6-ratio for these two fits is 20.1 for @xmath92 and @xmath93 degrees of freedom @xcite , corresponding to a probability of @xmath94 that we would obtain data with equal or greater preference for elliptical models if the clusters were spherical .",
    "if we neglect abell 697 , which is not well described by either model , then the @xmath6-ratio is 12.2 with a corresponding probability of @xmath95 .",
    "the weighted mean ellipticity of the five clusters is @xmath8 , consistent with results from x - ray data ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",

    "the resulting profile is significantly different from the profile obtained using the transfer function for the best - fit nagai model , indicating that the naive calculation of a transfer function using a point source is inadequate .",
    "compared to using the transfer function calculated from the best - fit elliptical nagai model , the peak decrement is reduced by @xmath255  @xmath3k@xmath4 , while the magnitude of the sz signal at the edge of the map is increased by @xmath255  @xmath3k@xmath4  ( _ i.e. _ , the deconvolved cluster image from a point - source transfer function is systematically broader ) .    as described in section  [ sec : cluster_model ] , we use the best - fit elliptical nagai model to determine the dc signal level in our maps since its value is unconstrained by our data .",
    "the measurement uncertainty in the value of the dc signal is small , @xmath256  @xmath3k@xmath4 , but there is a large amount of uncertainty in the model at large radii .",
    "based on the results from @xcite , n07 , and @xcite presented in @xcite , the rms scatter in the pressure profiles from cluster to cluster in simulations is @xmath257% .",

    "therefore , we conclude that there is a negligible amount of correlated noise in our processed images and our assumption that the noise covariance matrix is diagonal is valid .",
    "furthermore , we have estimated all of our parameter uncertainties ( @xmath261 , etc . ) directly from the distribution of values calculated from our noise realizations .",
    "consequently , any failure of our assumption that the covariance matrix is diagonal for the processed images will only affect the pixel - weighting and @xmath89 values for our model fits .    however , when we perform the same test of fitting a model to our model - cluster - plus - noise maps using noise realizations that have been deconvolved with our transfer function , the result is significantly different .",

    "since the noise in the deconvolved images is significantly spatially correlated , our assumption that the noise covariance matrix is diagonal fails .",
    "therefore , we estimate the uncertainties for the deconvolved images using the spread in values for the noise realizations rather than from the diagonal elements of the noise covariance matrix ( _ e.g. _ , the uncertainties in the radial profiles are determined from the rms spread in the radial profiles of the noise realizations ) .",
    "this is the same technique used by @xcite and @xcite to analyze apex - sz data .",

    "additionally , we obtain a reasonable goodness of fit for the models using these best - fit parameters , quantified by a pte @xmath265 , providing further evidence that there is no significant noise in the data that has not been included in our noise estimate .",
    "note that since the five cluster model profiles are fairly similar , we obtain comparable ptes for all five profiles .",
    "we have presented the first results from our program to image the sz effect in galaxy clusters with bolocam .",
    "these images have a beam - smoothed rms of @xmath2  @xmath3k@xmath4 , and a resolution of 58  arcsec . given this noise level , we are able to measure sz signal in radial profiles to approximately the edge of our maps , which corresponds to 6 - 7  arcmin or @xmath266 times @xmath5 . in order to subtract noise from atmospheric fluctuations , we effectively high - pass filter our cluster images .",
    "however , we are able to deconvolve the effects of this filter with biases that are negligible compared to our noise level , other than our recovery of the dc signal level . in fitting our images to spherical and elliptical beta and nagai models , we find no preference between the beta and nagai models due to the degeneracy between these models over the angular range to which our data are sensitive , but our data do show a definitive preference for elliptical models over spherical models .",
    "the weighted mean ellipticity of the five clusters is @xmath8 , consistent with results from x - ray data .",
    "additionally , the best - fit model parameters we determine from our data are consistent with those found from previous x - ray and sz measurements .",
    "we have also obtained model - independent estimates of @xmath21 , and we find scaling relations between @xmath21 and cluster mass that are consistent with self - similar predictions , with a scatter that is consistent with expectations for a @xmath2% intrinsic scatter .",
