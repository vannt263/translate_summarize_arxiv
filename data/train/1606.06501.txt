    "interaction potentials which decay not more rapidly than @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the space dimensionality and @xmath6 is the particles separation , are considered as long range ones .",
    "the reason is that for a long - range potential , the interaction of a particle with the more remote particles is stronger than that with less remote particles , so that the interaction with closest neighbors in sufficiently large systems becomes negligible . as to a good approximation remote particles",
    "constitute a continuous medium , the interaction is determined by their spatially averaged density which is the source of a mean field . hence systems with long - range interaction",
    "can be well - represented by their smooth densities and mean fields disregarding the effects of matter discreetness and , in particular , pair encounters .",
    "this is exactly the case of applicability of the collisionless vlasov equation which describes evolution of a smooth distribution function ( df ) in the six - dimensional ( 6d ) space of particles coordinates and velocities under the action of the self - consistent mean field .",
    "this 6d space is called @xmath7 space .",
    "thus , dynamics of many - particle systems with long - range interaction in the @xmath7 space is collisionless and governed by the vlasov equation @xcite .",
    "the final state to which any large classical system relaxes is the standard maxwell - boltzmann equilibrium as pair collisions will eventually manifest themselves .",
    "but in systems with long - range interaction the time when this happens increases approximately as the number of particle to the power which is larger than unity @xcite so that for a very long time the system is governed by the collisionless vlasov equation . as a result ,",
    "the physics of many long - range systems is essentially collisionless .",
    "for instance , the relaxation time due to pair collisions in galaxies is estimated to be much longer than the age of our universe ( which is known as zwicky paradox ) . at the same time",
    ", the remarkable regularity in the characteristics of  the gravitational systems , such as galaxies , suggests that these systems have reached some equilibrium states .",
    "this was the principal motivation for lynden - bell to consider the statistical equilibrium state to which a collisionless gravitational system can relax in its own violently changing mean field @xcite .",
    "the main challenge of this collisionless statistical approach was that the vlasov equation describes not particles , but a 6d incompressible liquid , which is a continuous system with the infinite number of conserved quantities .",
    "lynden - bell modeled the liquid by dividing it into small stable macroparticles and then incorporated the incompressibility by not allowing two macroparticles to occupy the same cell of the @xmath7 space .",
    "using the standard combinatorics for the discrete macroparticles , lynden - bell arrived at his famous fermi - like df .",
    "this lynden - bell s df ( lbdf ) successfully explained the two fundamental experimental facts which can not be explained by the standard maxwell - boltzmann statistics .",
    "first , thanks to the smooth macroscopic character of the vlasov equation which is insensitive to discrete properties of individual stars , the lbdf does not discriminate between stars with different masses as it depends on the average mass density .",
    "second , thanks to the incompressibility of vlasov s liquid , the lbdf possesses the fermi - like degeneracy which naturally explains the dense core - rarefied galo structure of galaxies and which , as eventually turned out , is universal for all systems with long - range interaction @xcite .",
    "the impressive elegancy of lynden - bell s result , the revealed evidence that the vlasov equation might have so a unique role in the statistical physics and its relation to the generic systems with long - range interaction had resulted in a wide interest to the equilibrium and dynamical properties of collisionless systems .",
    "these studies have developed into the novel branch of statistical physics identified as the statistical mechanics of systems with long - range interaction @xcite .",
    "by now it has been well established that the assumption that the violent relaxation results in certain equilibrium maximum entropy state is an idealization .",
    "the collisionless relaxation is incomplete because the efficiency of the mean - field - driven mixing is dying out as the system is approaching states with a smoother and smoother field , so that the state with complete mixing is not attained . in reality",
    ", the relaxation can cease at some of dynamically stable states of the vlasov equation which are numerous and substantially differ from the maximum entropy state @xcite . nevertheless , since its prediction by lynden - bell in 1967 for stellar systems , the equilibrium statistical mechanics of this idealized state has been attracting an unrelenting attention of theoretical physicists .",
    "the result obtained by lynden - bell has been rederived by various technics @xcite , praised and criticized @xcite , its quantitative predictability has been supported in some cases @xcite and denied in other cases @xcite , its validity has been reconsidered and a different form of the equilibrium state has been proposed @xcite .",
    "one reason is that systems with long - range interaction , hence collisionless and related with the lb statistics , appear in many different fields of physics : gravitational systems in astrophysics , charged beams with coulomb interaction in the plasma physics , two - dimensional hydrodynamics where the interaction of vortices is logarithmic , systems of many spherical colloids at liquid surfaces where the attraction scales as @xmath8 @xcite , dipolar systems and ferroelectric liquids .",
    "another reason is that the thermodynamics of systems with long - range interaction can not be based on the fundamental axioms of the standard thermodynamics of systems with short - range interactions such as spatial uniformity , additivity of entropy and energy , equivalence of the canonical and microcanonical description , presence of a thermal bath fixing the system s temperature @xcite .",
    "this brings a fresh breath to the thermodynamics .",
    "there is also a very peculiar source of attraction , a challenge unformulated explicitly but making theorists think of collisionless maximum entropy states which under some , even highly idealized assumptions , can result from the collisionless vlasov dynamics .",
    "the problem is that , as mentioned above , the vlasov equation describes motion of a 6d incompressible liquid .",
    "but , on the one hand , neither a liquid can be approximated by a set of separated shape - preserving fragments , nor any liquid fragment preserves its shape .",
    "this is true for any motion , but is particularly fundamental for a chaotic mixing motion which can possibly result in a maximum entropy state in any sense : such  a motion is supposed to eliminate correlations between initially neighboring liquid elements which implies producing thinner and thinner liquid filaments . on the other hand , while a verity of technics has been employed to address collisionless statistical equilibrium in different systems with long - range interaction , the common device for counting the number of states of the vlasov liquid has been either similar or essentially equivalent to the original lynden - bell s device , i.e. , dividing the liquid into independent shape - preserving fragments called macroparticles , dividing the @xmath7 space into cells each of which can accommodate exactly one macroparticle or nothing , and using the discrete combinatorics for counting possible distributions of the macroparticles over these cells @xcite .",
    "the introduction of macroparticles allows one to substitute the problem of the innumerable liquid degrees of freedom for the well - known problem of a finite number of particles , but the very idea of a nonspreading macroparticle contradicts the idea of the mixing dynamics which can lead to any kind of statistical equilibrium .",
    "indeed , in a mixing flow any small liquid element spreads over the whole accessible space so that its filaments can enter any cell of the @xmath7 space .",
    "we see that the main disadvantage of the present theory is the fundamental contradiction between the idea of solid , undiffuse and independent macroparticles and the continuity of a mixing flow of the 6d liquid .",
    "the problem of finding a maximum entropy state or , in other words , a statistical equilibrium state , which can result from the vlasov equation under highly idealized assumptions on the chaotic dynamics , may be described as follows .",
    "first of all , one has to deal with an actual 6d liquid rather than with any kind of particles ( i.e. , not with real particles , macroparticles , vortices ) . in the statistical equilibrium all the accessible states are equally probable . but",
    "any change of liquid s shape results in its new state .",
    "the question is how to describe the macroscopic and microscopic states of this continuous system and how to count its states in order to obtain the entropy .",
    "moreover , it is known that the vlasov system possesses the uncountable number of conserved quantities , values of the df at each point of the liquid usually called levels , which do not change along their trajectories .",
    "these integrals of motion must be imposed as certain restrictions on the accessible states .",
    "it is these integrals that account for the incompressibility and the related fermi - like exclusion property .",
    "however , in contrast to the simple `` one cell - one macroparticle '' restriction of lynden - bell s model , the actual incompressibility can only mean that the total amount of liquid with all different levels in a given cell of the @xmath9 space _ can not exceed its 6d volume _ @xmath10 .",
    "hence the amount of liquid in a given cell , which is either zero or one in lynden - bell s model , is a _ continuous number _ ranging from @xmath11 to @xmath10 , so that the summation over the occupation numbers must be replaced by some integration . finally , in principle",
    ", the degree of mixing of the 6d liquid can be different , and one has to specify this degree and find its connection to the final equilibrium state .",
    "in this paper i present the theory of the maximum entropy state of a 6d liquid to which systems with a long - range interaction can relax under the assumption of the chaotic dynamics governed by the vlasov equation . it turns out that the solution to this problems is not unique as it depends on the presupposed statistical properties of the vlasov dynamics . according to the ergodic theory @xcite , the chaoticity of a dynamical system ranges from ergodicity without mixing , which is the lowest statistical property , through mixing with zero kolmogorov - sinai entropy to the so - called k - mixing with nonzero kolmogorov - sinai entropy , which is the highest statistical property . in the next section i present some information from the ergodic theory which is instructive to our problem ,",
    "give further details of the approach , and briefly describe the structure and results of this paper .",
    "motion of a liquid in any space is a flow .",
    "flows on different phase spaces and their statistical properties are the subject of the ergodic theory balescu , reichl , bil , sinai .",
    "it is therefore natural to resort to the ideas of the ergodic theory for developing a statistical approach to the 6d vlasov liquid .",
    "one of the most important quantities in the language of the ergodic theory is the measure ( volume ) @xmath12 of intersection @xmath13 of a set @xmath14 with a set @xmath15 this quantity determines probability that a point from @xmath14 can be found in the set @xmath16 and thus defines the coarse - grained df of @xmath14 .",
    "the flow implies that the set @xmath14 occupied by liquid changes its shape and is a function of time @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 .",
    "the quantity @xmath19 is adequate to specify the shape @xmath20 of a flowing set @xmath14 at an instant @xmath17 with respect to the fixed sets @xmath21 which can be used as a reference frame for a coarse - grained description of the flow @xmath22 at last , the fundamental statistical properties of dynamical systems in the ergodic theory can be expressed in terms of the above measure of intersection .",
    "ergodic and mixing flows preserve the volume of a flowing set : @xmath23 ergodicity is the weakest statistical property of a dynamical system which does not imply its relaxation to some stationary state . in an ergodic ( but non - mixing ) flow @xmath20 of a set @xmath14 , its measure of intersection with a fixed set @xmath16 remains time dependent at all times .",
    "the only time independent quantity is the temporal average of @xmath24 @xcite : @xmath25hence , measuring the amount of liquid @xmath14 in the fixed set @xmath16 , @xmath19 , at different times @xmath17 will give different results as @xmath19 as a function of @xmath17 is not converging to any stationary value .",
    "we see that the ergodicity alone does not result in a relaxation . the formula ( [ erg ] )",
    "tells one that in an ergodic flow , a liquid fragment @xmath14 does not spread over the accessible space , its points do not decorrelate and , as time elapses , @xmath14 moves roughly as a single piece .",
    "thus , the chaoticity of the ergodic motion of @xmath14 consists in the fact that @xmath14 can be found everywhere with equal probability .    a mixing flow is ergodic , but converse is not necessarily true .",
    "mixing is a much stronger statistical property than ergodicity and can be naturally associated with a relaxation towards certain time independent state . in a mixing flow @xmath20 of a set @xmath14",
    ", its measure of intersection with a fixed set @xmath16 tends to the time independent value:@xmath26hence , measuring the amount of liquid @xmath14 in the fixed set @xmath16 , @xmath19 , at different times @xmath17 one will find that after some time the value of @xmath27 gets closer and closer to a constant @xmath28 which can naturally be considered as the equilibrium value .",
    "thus , one can say that in the mixing flow any nonequilibrium distribution relaxes to the equilibrium state .",
    "the formula ( [ mix ] ) tells one that in a mixing flow , a liquid fragment @xmath14 uniformly spreads over the accessible space ; as time elapses , @xmath14 develops filaments which get thinner and thinner , and its points decorrelate and move more and more independently .",
    "thus , the mixing motion of @xmath14 is chaotic indeed .",
    "for instance , if @xmath14 consists of fragments of different colors which do not interpenetrate , then after the relaxation every one of these colors will be present in any fixed set @xmath16 however small it be .",
    "the only difference to our case is that we have different levels of the initial df rather than colors .",
    "the ergodic theory considers flows on a phase space where the state of a system is given by a single point while a set of finite measure represents an ensemble of similar systems .",
    "the @xmath7 space is not the phase space of a 6d liquid ( the phase space is introduced in the next sec.2 ) . in @xmath7 space",
    "the state of a liquid is determined by a set occupied by the liquid or , in other words , by liquid s shape .",
    "a liquid element does spread over the entire @xmath7 space , but not necessarily homogeneously as in phase space , and it is finding the inhomogeneous distribution in the @xmath7 space that is the main problem of the theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , in what follows the homogeneity of smearing expressed by eq.([mix ] ) is not assumed in the @xmath29 space even in the equilibrium state .",
    "now we can more instructively describe the fundamental problem one has to face when developing a statistical theory of an actual continuous liquid .",
    "suppose we know the above distribution of the liquid s levels over the fixed cells @xmath21 in the @xmath7 space .",
    "given these coarse - grained macroscopic quantities are fixed , however , the arrangement of different levels inside a single cell can be different at a finer scale .",
    "the question is how many states with different inner arrangements exist for the above fixed macroscopic levels distribution .",
    "the answer to this question can be obtained by using the famous shannon - mcmillan - breiman theorem .",
    "the contact of our problem to this theorem will be established in sec .",
    "iii.c .    the statistical property of mixing implies that any small fragment of a liquid spreads over the total accessible space .",
    "this is a complete mixing , but we would like to make a contact with the more real situation . as already stressed above , the vlasov dynamics can not result in a complete mixing as the higher the mixing achieved in the system , the smoother the mean field is , and , as a result , the weaker the mixing efficiency becomes .",
    "an incomplete mixing implies that points of a liquid that were initially sufficiently remote from one another move independently and can be found at any relative distance .",
    "however , the filaments developing in the flow will not be going beyond some minimum size , the mixing stops and finer scale patterns will not be produced .",
    "this is because the points of a liquid that were initially separated insufficiently remain correlated and can not run away from one another .",
    "then the degree of incomplete mixing can be accounted for by the number @xmath0 of sets in the partition of the initial liquid s shape @xmath30 which can be considered statistically independent .",
    "let @xmath30 be the initial set occupied by the liquid and @xmath31 @xmath32 , be its partition into disjoint subsets @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 in the flow , each @xmath33 changes its shape , and the argument @xmath11 in eq.(a0 ) changes to @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath35 be a partition of the accessible space into fixed disjoint subsets @xmath36 . obviously , the probability that a point from @xmath33 is found in @xmath36 is proportional to the quantity @xmath37 if the liquid elements @xmath33 flow independently , then the joint probability @xmath38 that a point from @xmath39 enters a set @xmath40 , a point from @xmath41 enters a set @xmath42 a point from @xmath43 enters a set @xmath44 is proportional to the product of the probabilities:@xmath45it is important to stress that there are only @xmath0 factors in the joint probability @xmath38 as the maximum number of independent events @xmath46 at a time is @xmath0 .",
    "we will see that it is the length @xmath0 of a sequence consisting of the above independent events that determines the number of microscopic states for a given coarse - grained levels distribution . as to points within the same set @xmath33 , by the assumption of incomplete mixing , they do not move independently and contribute very little to the number of microscopic states .",
    "i choose the number @xmath0 of the statistically independent elements of a liquid as a measure of incomplete mixing . for @xmath0",
    "very large , i.e. , much larger than the number of particles @xmath1 in the system , the flow is strongly mixing . for @xmath2 ,",
    "the system is ergodic without mixing . in the intermediate case of @xmath0 on the order of @xmath1 or lesser",
    ", the mixing is incomplete .",
    "we will see that form of the equilibrium df depends on @xmath47    in the next section , i introduce the phase space of the 6d incompressible vlasov liquid , its microscopic and macroscopic states , formulate the problem in terms of the intersection measures discussed above , and present the exact constraints on the accessible phase space due to the incompressibility of the flow . in sec.iii , the microcanonical statistical integral for the accessible number of states",
    "is introduced and formulated in terms of the macrostates . in particular , in sections iii.b and iii.c , analog of the discrete combinatorics for a continuous systems , which consists of two steps , is developed : first , i introduce the ensemble of phase subspaces which accounts for the states of a liquid on all subsets of the phase space ; second , the number of microstates in a given macrostate is found by connecting the problem with the shannon - mcmillan - breiman theorem . in sec.iii.d",
    "the energy of the system is expressed in terms of the macroscopic states . here",
    "the interaction is taken in the form of the newton or coulomb potentials in the 3d space .",
    "this restriction is chosen for certainty , but the method developed in this paper can be applied for any long - range potential . in sec.iv , the statistical integral",
    "is calculated and in sec.v the results are present for strong mixing , for ergodicity without mixing , and for an incomplete mixing .",
    "the end of sec.iii is devoted to some thermodynamics , in particular , the entropy is expressed in terms of the total energy and the initial df . in the conclusion , sec.vi ,",
    "the results are briefly summarized .",
    "the equilibrium df for strong mixing is found to be exactly of the fermi - dirac form : different levels do not appear individually and are present as a perfect mixture which is distributed over energy values . a pure ergodic case without mixing is considered formally since , as explained in sec.i.b , in this case the system does not relax to a time independent state .",
    "the formal summation over possible occupation numbers in a small reference cell results exactly in the lbdf . in the intermediate case of incomplete mixing ,",
    "the equilibrium df is more complex than the lbdf : statistically independent elements with different initial densities ( levels ) have distinguishable contributions in the df , but , in addition , the contribution of a given value of the ( continuous ) occupation number in the @xmath7 space appears with the weight depending on the mixing degree .",
    "denote @xmath48 the 6d @xmath7 space .",
    "let @xmath49 be a point of @xmath48  : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the vector of position and @xmath52 is the velocity of a particle .",
    "let at @xmath53 the initial df @xmath54 be nonzero in the bounded area @xmath55 whose points be @xmath56 : @xmath57 clearly , the set @xmath55 [ i.e. , support of @xmath54 ] describes the initial shape of the 6d liquid while @xmath54 gives the liquid s density at each point @xmath56 .",
    "the temporal dynamics of the liquid in @xmath48 , the flow , is governed by the vlasov equation .",
    "after the time @xmath17 each point @xmath56 moves to the point @xmath59 and the liquid s shape changes , @xmath60 .",
    "all liquid elements of @xmath55 also change their shapes but the vlasov equation preserves their individual volumes which is associated with the incompressibility . as a result ,",
    "the value of df does not change along the trajectories of points @xmath61 @xmath62@xmath63=\\ f_{0}(\\tau _ { 0 } ) .",

    ".      the three statistics obtained are fermi - dirac - like which allows one to make use of the well - known results from the theory of an ideal fermi gas landau .",
    "let us first realize that @xmath397 , the entropy @xmath398 of the system , in the limit @xmath399 is equal to the expression for the exponent in formula ( [ gamma1 ] ) , calculated at the solution of the equations ( [ dels ] ) .",
    "indeed , on the @xmath319 integration the prefactor @xmath400 cancels out ; for large @xmath1 , the additional exponent resulting from the gauss integral over @xmath401 , scales as @xmath402 and is negligible as compared with the principal term which scales as @xmath1 ( or even as @xmath403 as the potential energy of systems with a long - range interaction is proportional to @xmath403 ) . as a result , the entropy @xmath398 takes the following form:@xmath404 ,   \\label{s2}\\]]where @xmath405 is defined in ( [ zm ] ) .",
    "the solution of the equations ( [ dels ] ) depends on the parameter @xmath121 and is a functional of the initial df @xmath54 and the external field @xmath406 in the discrete version , the functional dependence on @xmath407 is replaced by the dependence on the @xmath75 parameters @xmath408 @xmath409it is now easy to see that , by virtue of the equations ( [ dels ] ) , one has@xmath410where the expression in the rhs of ( [ fi ext ] ) is just the spatial density of particles @xmath411 at point @xmath51 times @xmath412 .",
    "thus , @xmath413we see that @xmath414 can be associated with the global temperature and @xmath371 with the global chemical potential of the particles of the @xmath84-th kind ( which is determined by belonging to the liquid element with the density @xmath415 ) . in an additive system with short - range interaction , these two fundamental thermodynamic quantities are the characteristics of any subsystem , but in our nonadditive system they can be attributed only to the total system and in this sense are global . at the same time",
    ", the response to a small variation of the external field , @xmath416 is local as in systems with a short - range interaction .",
    "the difference is however that the density in systems with short - range interactions is spatially dependent only in a nonzero external field whereas in systems with long - range interaction @xmath411 can be inhomogeneous even for zero external field .",
    "it is possible to simplify the expression for entropy . for convenience ,",
    "let us put @xmath417/t = u$ ] .",
    "then the general expression for @xmath405 ( [ zm ] ) is @xmath418 \\right\\ } ^{m_{k}x}x^{-m_{k}x}.   \\label{zzz}\\]]consider the integral @xmath419integrating by parts , one obtains@xmath420where @xmath381 is the df ( [ dfm ] ) . substituting this expression in @xmath398 , one gets@xmath421 .",
    "\\label{s3}\\]]it is now obvious that the spatial integral is equal to the total intrinsic potential energy @xmath422 plus ( 2/3 ) of the total kinetic energy @xmath423 now we make use of the 3d virial condition for our system  @xcite .",
    "the total energy @xmath424 where @xmath425 is the system s energy in the external field:@xmath426the most natural assumption is that the interaction of the particles with the external field is also coulomb - like and thus a homogeneous function of order @xmath427 @xcite .",
    "then , in a stationary state , the 3d virial relation tells one that @xmath428 so that @xmath429 then @xmath430 and the entropy reduces to the following form:@xmath431this formula is also valid for the ergodic case without mixing when the df is formally equal to the lbdf ( [ lbdf ] ) . in the case of strong mixing , this relation reduces to@xmath432to demonstrarte the effect of nonadditivity of our coulomb - like long - range interaction in 3 dimensions , we rewrite this formula in the following form:@xmath433and compare it with the expression for the gibbs free energy @xmath434 ( gibbs - duham equation ) where the work of the external force @xmath435 corresponds to the energy in the external field @xmath425 ( work done by the external source ) .",
    "we see that the correspondence between the two formulas is violated by the term @xmath436 in the lhs of our formula ( [ gibbs ] ) .",
    "very recently latella et al @xcite showed that the standard gibbs - duham equation is modified by the long - range interaction also in systems which have already attained the final equilibrium state due to the collisions .",
    "however , the direct comparison between the collisional systems considered in @xcite and the quasi - equilibrium collisionless systems considered in this paper can not be made .",
    "the reason is that , in collisional systems , the integrals over velocities and coordinates are independent whereas , in collisionless systems , they are not since the local consevation laws of vlasov s equation impose the connection between volumes of the liquid elements in the velocity and coordinate spaces and , in the end , give rise to eq.([s3 ] ) .    in the case of a fermi gas , chemical potential at @xmath437 is the fermi energy @xmath438 .",
    "as our statistics are fermi - like , one obtains the relation between the total energy and the chemical potential @xmath439 of the fully degenerate 6d liquid : @xmath440 in the case of strong mixing and @xmath441 this reduces to@xmath442while , for fermi gas , this relation is @xmath443 .",
    "the difference between our case of the long - range interaction and fermi - gas is however not just in the coefficients : @xmath444 is a function of the particle density whereas @xmath445 depends on the total number of particles @xmath1 ( expectedly @xmath446 ) .",
    "we note that in the fully degenerate state the 6d liquid is stratified .",
    "the liquid is poured in a 6d `` glass '' produced by the mean field potential and fills the 6d volume which is exactly equal to the volume of the initial liquid s volume @xmath447 at the very bottom is the liquid element with the maximum @xmath448 which occupies the volume @xmath10 ; the layer of liquid with the next large @xmath285 lies over the liquid with the largest @xmath449 and so on .",
    "the quantity @xmath450 is the energy of a particle at the top of the layer with @xmath451 it is worth noting that this state is the absolute minimum energy state and can be realized without any mixing just via precipitation of havier fractions closer to the bottom of the potential well .",
    "almost fifty years ago linden - bell assumed that the 6d liquid described by the vlasov equation can relax to some maximum entropy state @xcite .",
    "this required a very strong and highly idealized assumption of a `` good '' mixing in the liquid s phase space .",
    "moreover , any mixing implies that liquid elements spread over the accessible @xmath7 space and thus do not preserve their initial shapes . in spite of that linden - bell modeled the liquid by a large set of independent shape - preserving macroparticles in an obvious contradiction to the mixing character of the flow .",
    "nevertheless , this result has had a profound influence both on the astrophysics and statistical mechanics . over the years",
    ", there has been a number of papers where the equilibrium maximum entropy state was addressed by means of different technics and in relations to different systems with long - range interaction @xcite .",
    "but the main peculiarity of a liquid motion , a flow , which must be mixing if we expect relaxation to some statistical eqilibrium and thus making very small liquid elements spread over the entire space , has not been incorporated .",
    "in other words , the actual 6d liquid has not been adequately described . in this paper ,",
    "based on the ideas of the ergodic theory , i developed an equilibrium statistical approach to an actual 6d liquid in the @xmath7 space and incorporated all the integrals of motion of the vlasov equation , associated with the point - wise incompressibility of the liquid .",
    "i specified the assumption of mixing .",
    "it can be very strong , practically a k mixing when all points of a liquid are statistically independent . or mixing can be incomplete , e.g. , approximately one independent liquid element per particle . and mixing can be very weak , equivalent to pure ergodicity when the number of independent liquid elements is very small . in the case of mixing",
    ", the flow relaxes to certain equilibrium state which depends on the mixing strength . for a very strong mixing , this state is given exactly by the fermi - dirac df ( [ df1 ] ) , in which different levels of the initial df are perfectly mixed and do not appear individually . for incomplete mixing ,",
    "different levels manifest themselves and , in addition , the df ( [ dfm ] ) depends on the density of the statistically independent liquid elements .",
    "it is found that the lbdf ( [ lbdf ] ) formally corresponds to a pure ergodic flow which does not result in relaxation to a time independent state .",
    "the phase space of vlasov s liquid where its macrostate is given by a single point ( in contrast to the @xmath7 space where the liquid is desribed by its multipoint shape ) is introduced .",
    "the integrals of motions are enumerated by the points of the support of the initial df .",
    "the crucial result of the paper is expressed by the formulae ( [ wa ] ) and ( [ hk ] ) - ( [ h ] ) which give the number of microscopic states in a given macroscopic state of a liquid .",
    "this result is based on the two ideas : a ) introduction of the ensemble of phase subspaces which is a continuous analog of accounting for distributions of particles realized on subspaces of dimensions smaller than that of the total space of states ; b ) connecting microscopic states in a given macrostate with the sequences produced by appropriate bernulli mapping for which the number of observable sequences ( i.e. , those with nonvanishing probability ) is given by the shannon - mamillan - breiman theorem .",
    "the relation between the entropy , total energy , and the initial df is derived .",
    "the result of this paper clarifies status of maximum entropy states which , under any possible assumptions of the chaoticity of vlasov s flow , can , in principle , be achieved .",
    "the introduced idea of incomplete relaxation connected to the number of statistically independent liquid elements is probably just one approach and does not exhaust all possibilities .",
    "further studies in this direction can clarify the status of the incomplete relaxation and the df ( [ dfm ] ) in a more general context .",
    "the presented approach can be viewed as a step in development of the statistical mechanical technics adequate for dealing with continuous , distributed , and liquid - like systems .",
    "specific effects that may be derived from the df ( [ dfm ] ) will be studied in the future .",
    "for instance , the distribution of an ideal gas over its accessible @xmath452 dimensional phase space is homogeneous , but the maxwell - boltzmann df , which is the df in its 6d @xmath7 space , is inhomogeneous .",
    "usually , the habbard - stratonovich transformation is based on a real gauss integral .",
    "however , our formula ( [ hs ] ) is based on a complex gauss integral , see , e.g. , @xcite , to incorporate both positive and negative sign of @xmath321 in the interaction potential ( [ w ] ) .        of course , it is difficult to imagine how @xmath121 can be fixed in an external field which can change the system s energy .",
    "the external field for such `` isolated system '' plays the role analogous to external pressure . in this sense ,",
    "the inclusion of an external field is somewhat formal ."
