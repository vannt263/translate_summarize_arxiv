    ", we obtained a constant value of refractive index @xmath19 in the 0.2 - 2.0 thz frequency range .",
    "further , the unpumped dc conductivity @xmath20 was found to be in the range 10 - 20 s m@xmath2 indicating that the sample was very mildly doped .",
    "electrical measurements on similar single - layer and multilayer samples have indicated that these mos@xmath4 samples tend to be n - doped@xcite .",
    "given the large value of the refractive index and the small value of @xmath20 , this unpumped transmission measurement could not reliably determine the frequency dependence of the conductivity and thereby the mobility .",
    "in contrast , since the change in thz transmission , @xmath21 , between pumped and unpumped samples is directly proportional to the change in the conductivity @xmath22 , optical - pump thz - probe spectroscopy is a highly - sensitive method to extract the frequency - dependent conductivity .    in the optical - pump thz - probe scheme , depicted in figure [ fig : deltae](a - b ) , 780 nm center wavelength ( 1.58 ev ) , sub-100 fs optical pulses excite electron and hole distributions at the six @xmath23 points and the @xmath24 point , respectively , after which the distributions cool and recombine .",
    "the field of the thz pulse transmitted through the pumped sample , @xmath25 , is sensitive to the evolving conductivity and , therefore , depends on the pump - probe delay @xmath26 . in our experiments ,",
    "the incident optical and thz pulses are mechanically chopped at different frequencies and the transmitted thz pulse is measured at the sum frequency .",
    "we therefore measure the change in the transmitted thz pulse , @xmath27 , in the presence ( @xmath28 ) and absence ( @xmath29 ) of optical pumping . in this paper ,",

    "@xmath5 contains information of both the amplitude and phase changes of @xmath31 upon pumping .",
    "comparison of @xmath5 and @xmath31 shows a trend of increasing phase shifts with decreasing temperatures due to photoexcited carriers .",
    "thus , both the amplitude and the phase of the transmitted thz pulse are needed to determine the sample response .",
    "the sample response can be determined from the measured change in the transmitted thz pulse , @xmath5 , as follows .",
    "we scan the pump - probe delay simultaneously with the transmitted thz pulse in the time - domain thz spectrometer such that each measured point of the transmitted thz pulse is at the same delay , @xmath26 , from the pump@xcite .",

    "we find that the measured conductivity spectra closely follow the drude form , @xmath46 , which is the simplest conductivity model in the relaxation time approximation .",
    "therefore , the current impulse response @xmath47 is @xmath48 .",
    "we fit the real and imaginary parts of the data simultaneously with a weighted least - squares regression and extract the photoexcited dc conductivity @xmath49 and the carrier momentum scattering time @xmath44 .",
    "weights were the data variance at each frequency point over twenty scans .",
    "the high quality of fits to the data obtained at all temperatures , as shown in figure [ fig : drudefits ] , is strong evidence of the fact that the change in thz transmission we measure indeed originates from the intraband conductivity of the photoexcited carriers .",
    "also , at all temperatures we find no significant variation in the extracted value of @xmath44 for any value of @xmath26 in the range 5 ps @xmath50 12 ns .",
    "since one expects very hot carriers to have average momentum scattering times different from that of cold carriers@xcite , this observation suggests that the carrier distributions after photoexcitation cool down on time scales shorter than a few picoseconds .",

    "this linear temperature dependence is expected for quasi - elastic acoustic phonon scattering in 2d and layered materials in the equipartition regime@xcite .",

    "since the in - plane conductivity effective masses for electrons and holes are approximately the same in multilayer mos@xmath4@xcite , one can write the dc conductivity as @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the total mobile carrier density and equals the sum of the mobile electron density , @xmath18 , and the mobile hole density , @xmath74 .",

    "the pump fluence in each case is @xmath91.2 @xmath11j/@xmath3 . immediately after photoexcitation ( @xmath79 ) , the conductivity increases , reaching its maximum value within 5 ps at all temperatures .",
    "the error - range displayed for each data point represents a 95% confidence interval for the fitting parameter @xmath77 .",
    "the dashed lines superimposed on the data represent fittings using exponential curves with 0.7 ps and 1.2 ps time constants at 300 k and 45 k , respectively .",
    "our data suggests that the conductivity reaches its peak value faster at higher temperatures .",
    "as we discuss below , we attribute these short - time - scale dynamics to picosecond cooling of the electron and hole distributions .",
    "as depicted in figure [ fig : deltae](b ) , the 1.58 ev pump photons excite electrons from the valence band maximum at the @xmath24 point to the conduction band minima at the @xmath23 point by a phonon - assisted ( or impurity - assisted ) indirect absorption process . since the indirect bandgap in multilayer mos@xmath4 is around 1.29 ev@xcite ,",
    "the photoexcited electrons and holes are at an elevated temperature compared to the lattice immediately after photoexcitation and thermalization@xcite .",
    "if the photon energy in excess of the indirect bandgap contributes to the kinetic energy of the carriers , we estimate the carrier temperature immediately after photoexcitation to be around 1100 k. at this high temperature , the electron and hole distributions would be spread out in energy , with fast momentum scattering rates and reduced mobility due to optical phonons@xcite . as the carrier distributions relax towards the band extrema and cool via optical phonon emission , the carrier momentum scattering rates decrease and the conductivity increases .",
    "the rise in the conductivity following photoexcitation observed in our experiments is therefore indicative of carrier cooling .",
    "the slower cooling observed at lower lattice temperatures can be attributed to a number of factors .",
    "for example , the carrier cooling rates due to optical phonon emission are proportional to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 , the bose occupation factor for phonons , is aproximately 20% larger at 300 k compared to 45 k. in addition , the heat capacity of optical phonons is around three orders of magnitude larger at 300 k compared to 45 k and , therefore , carrier cooling bottleneck due to the generation of hot phonons is much reduced at higher lattice temepratures@xcite .",

    "we attribute this relaxation to carrier trapping and recombination by defects .",
    "the carrier density decay rate is relatively fast in the first @xmath9100 ps after photoexcitation , after which the decay occurs on much longer time scales .",
    "the maximum probe delay allowed by our setup , 400 ps , is unable to resolve these long time scales .",
    "but the non - zero carrier densities observed at negative probe delays show that the photoexcited carrier density does not completely decay in the time interval , around 12.3 ns , between two successive optical pulses .",

    "figure [ fig : powerdynamics](c ) shows that @xmath85 increases approximately linearly with @xmath94 .",
    "any physical model that describes the observed carrier dynamics must account for the transition from the fast decay rates in the first @xmath9100 ps to the slow decay rates thereafter .",
    "in addition , the model must account for the severe nonlinearity of @xmath96 and @xmath86 versus pump fluence .",
    "here , we present a model of carrier relaxation based on trapping and recombination by optically - active defect states .",
    "this model explains all features of the observed carrier dynamics at 45 k. the natural mos@xmath0 used in our work is known to have defects such as vacancies , grain boundaries , and impurities@xcite .",
    "many of these defects are optically active in the near - ir wavelength region and appear in the optical absorption spectra@xcite .",
    "we assume that the initial fast decay of the photoexcited carrier density is due to the capture of electrons by defect states in the bandgap@xcite ( see figure [ fig : deltae](b ) ) . as these defect",
    "states become full of electrons , the decay rate decreases ( due to pauli blocking ) and becomes limited by the capture of photoexcited holes from the valence band .",
    "the optical pump pulse excites electrons to the conduction band from both the valence band and also the defect states , and we assume that the defect states become empty immediately after the pump pulse@xcite .",
    "our final assumption is that the defect states are assumed to be occupied by electrons in thermal equilibrium in our n - doped sample .",
    "ignoring thermal generation of electrons and holes from defect states , the rate equations for the decay of the electron and hole densities in our model are ( see supplementary information ) , @xmath97 here , @xmath18 and @xmath74 are the total mobile electron and hole densities , respectively , and @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) is the rate constant for electron capture ( hole capture ) by the defect states via the dominant auger mechanisms in a n - doped semiconductor@xcite .",

    "@xmath101 is the density of defect states , and @xmath102 is the electron occupation of the defect states , assumed to be unity in equilibrium . note that a phonon - assisted carrier trapping process would not have the carrier density dependence consistent with the observed decay rates@xcite .",
    "we varied the values of the fitting parameters @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath103 , and @xmath100 in simulations to fit the data in figures [ fig : powerdynamics](a ) and [ fig : powerdynamics](b ) .",
    "the simulations involved time - stepping the rate equations over many ( 1 - 5@xmath104 ) pump pulse cycles until a steady state was achieved .",
    "the difference @xmath105 @xmath106 per @xmath11j @xmath43 determined the mobile carrier density created by the pump pulse in our simulations .",
    "the data in figure [ fig : powerdynamics ] can inform the search for appropriate values of the fitting parameters . immediately after photoexcitation , since @xmath18 varies as @xmath107 , the slope of the line in figure [ fig : powerdynamics](c ) estimates the product @xmath108 . since the long term decay of the photoexcited density is limited by the capture of holes in defects , the values of @xmath96 estimate the product @xmath109 .",
    "finally , the density of defect states governs how quickly they fill with electrons , therefore @xmath101 is determined from the time at which the initial fast decay transitions to the slower decay , as measured in figure [ fig : powerdynamics](a ) .",

    "the model presented here closely agrees with the data , accurately reproducing the values of @xmath96 , the relaxation curves , and the nonlinearity of @xmath75 versus pump fluence .",
    "in this paper , we presented measurements of the mobility of photoexcited carriers in multilayer mos@xmath0 using thz time - domain spectroscopy .",
    "the observed temperature dependence of the mobility for @xmath116 k indicates acoustic phonon scattering as the dominant mobility - limiting mechanism .",
    "the measured carrier momentum scattering rates are comparable to theoretical predictions based on phonon - scattering - limited transport@xcite .",
    "in contrast , previously reported dc electrical measurements have suggested impurity or defect scattering as the dominant mobility - limiting mechanism in multilayer mos@xmath0@xcite .",
    "given the prevalence of defects and impurities in mos@xmath0@xcite , it is intriguing that we observe mobilities limited by acoustic phonon scattering .",
    "the observed high mobilities at low temperatures in our experiments could be related to the fact that our measurements were performed at very high frequencies .",
    "it is well known theoretically and experimentally that ac conductivity in disordered materials increases with the ac frequency@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon appears in the microscopic models of hopping conduction@xcite as well as in the classical models of the ac conductivity in inhomogeneous materials@xcite .",
    "since we did not see signatures of ac hopping conduction in our sample at any temperature , we believe models that describe the ac conductivity in inhomogeneous materials are more relevant to our observations@xcite . accordingly , we believe that the mos@xmath4 atomic layers in our sample consist of interspersed high and low mobility regions ( due to grain boundaries , crystal defects , impurities , etc.@xcite ) and the conductivity of the layers is determined by the resistive and capacitive couplings of these regions@xcite . even a small fraction of low mobility regions can significantly affect the dc conductivity in lower dimensions .",
    "the high mobility regions have a conductivity given by the drude form .",
    "the ac conductivity of the sample is then expected to increase with the frequency until the low mobility regions are capacitively shorted out and the conductivity of the sample is then limited by the drude conductivity of the high mobility regions .",
    "although this model qualitatively explains the observation of the long momentum scattering times in our experiments , investigation of the frequency dependence of the sample conductivity in the low frequency region ( @xmath117 thz ) is needed to fully understand the nature of the transport and determine which model , if any , best describes the nature of the conduction .",
    "carrier relaxation and recombination dynamics directly affect the performance of almost all electronic and optoelectronic devices .",
    "we have observed several time scales in the dynamics associated with carrier relaxation and recombination .",
    "the initial intraband relaxation ( or carrier cooling ) occurs within 5 ps .",
    "carrier interband recombination appears to result from carrier trapping in optically active defect states , with recombination lasting over tens of nanoseconds due to slow hole capture in the defect states .",
    "it is important to mention that simple bimolecular recombination ( proportional to @xmath118 ) and direct interband auger recombination ( proportional to @xmath119 ) are not sufficiently nonlinear to account for the density dependence seen in figure [ fig : powerdynamics](b ) .",
    "although our data shows that the recombination times in multilayer mos@xmath4 are long , they are short in comparison with other indirect bandgap semiconductors , such as high - quality si or ge , which have recombination times in excess of one microsecond at room temperature@xcite .",

    "we use equation 1 of the main text to estimate the frequency - dependent transmission of thz pulses through the mos@xmath0 sample .",
    "equation 1 can be derived as follows .",
    "we start with the exact solution for the transmission of light through an etalon with a refractive index @xmath135 and thickness @xmath15 , surrounded by air ( @xmath136 ) , @xmath137 in the limit , @xmath138 , @xmath139^{-1 } \\label{eq : approx}\\ ] ] for the measured thz refractive index of mos@xmath4 , @xmath140 , and the thickness of our sample , @xmath141 @xmath11 m , the approximation in the above expression is extremely good , as illustrated in figure [ fig : trans ] .      in the case of a conductive medium , with conductivity @xmath10 , the complex refractive index is , @xmath143 . here , @xmath18 is the frequency - independent refractive index and @xmath144 is the permittivity of free space .",
    "the inverse fourier transform of the relation in equation [ eq : approx ] gives , @xmath145 - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0(n^{2}-1 ) } j(t)\\ ] ] subtracting versions of the above equation in the presence and absence of optical pumping one obtains , @xmath146 equation 2 in the text follows directly from the above relation following the substitution @xmath147 .      in this section ,",
    "we wish to establish equations 3 and 6 of the main text .",
    "we assume that the current density @xmath148 in the sample for pump - probe delay @xmath26 in the presence of the field @xmath149 of a thz pulse and a time - dependent dc conductivity @xmath150 is@xcite , @xmath151 \\otimes j(t ) \\label{eq : js}\\ ] ] here , @xmath38 is the normalized current impulse response ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath152 is the convolution operator with respect to @xmath126 .",
    "this is the most general way of writing the current response if the current density obeys the operator equation , @xmath153 where , @xmath154 is a linear - time - invariant ( lti ) differential operator .",
    "equation [ eq : js ] gives , @xmath155 = \\tilde{e}(t , u ) \\otimes \\tilde{\\sigma}(t , u)\\ ] ] the change @xmath127 in the current density in the presence and absence of pumping is @xmath156 . here ,",
    "the subscripts p and 0 indicate the value with and without optical pumping , respectively",
    ". therefore , one obtains , @xmath157 by applying a fourier transform with respect to @xmath126 to each term , we have , @xmath158 equations 3 and 6 of the main text will be valid provided the final two terms on the right hand side of equation [ eq : dj ] are negligibly small compared to the first term . in figure [ fig : ratio ] , we show a representative measured ratio of @xmath159 , which is at most on the order of @xmath160 for the highest pump fluence used in our experiments . at all other temperatures , pump fluences , and pump - probe delays ,",
    "this ratio is either similar or smaller . since @xmath161 at all frequencies",
    ", we can safely neglect @xmath162 compared to @xmath163 in equation [ eq : dj ] .",
    "next , using equation 2 from the main text , we see that the ratio @xmath164 s m@xmath2 .",
    "in contrast , the measured value of the unpumped dc conductivity @xmath165 is smaller than @xmath166 s m@xmath2 and , therefore , @xmath167 at all frequencies .",
    "consequently , we can also neglect @xmath168 compared to @xmath163 in equation [ eq : dj ] . in this way",
    ", we empirically verify that our use of the approximations in equations 3 and 6 in the main text is valid for our our experiments .",
    "theoretically , it can be shown that , @xmath169 the second term in equation [ eq : dj ] can be neglected provided @xmath170 , which is indeed the case in our experiments .",
    "there are essentially two main mechanisms for the capture / emission of electrons and holes at / from localized crystal defects@xcite : ( 1 ) phonon - assisted processes , and ( 2 ) auger processes .",
    "phonon - assisted processes can be single - phonon processes or multi - phonon processes , including phonon - cascade processes@xcite . in phonon - assisted processes the capture rates ( units : @xmath106s@xmath2 ) ,",
    "tend to go linearly with the carrier density ( i.e. the capture times are independent of the carrier density ) .",
    "the capture times observed in our experiments are carrier density dependent ( inverse electron capture times increase linearly with the electron density ) , as shown in figure 5(c ) of the main text .",
    "the capture times in auger processes are carrier density dependent .",
    "figure [ fig : auger ] shows the four basic auger processes for the capture of electrons ( ( i ) and ( ii ) ) and holes ( ( iii ) and ( iv ) ) at defects .",
    "the corresponding emission processes are the just the inverse of the capture processes .",
    "the rate equations for each auger process ( and its inverse ) can be written using figure [ fig : auger ] .",
    "for example , the electron density rate equation for process ( i ) and its inverse is , @xmath174 here , @xmath18 is the electron density , @xmath98 is the rate constant for electron capture by the defect state , @xmath175 is the defect density , and @xmath176 is the occupation of the defect state .",
    "the first terms describes the capture process and the second term describes the emission process . the value of the constant @xmath177 can be determined by using the fact that in thermal equilibrium @xmath178 : @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the equilibrium electron density and @xmath181 is the equilibrium defect occupation . if in equilibrium @xmath182 , as is expected for defects deeper than a few @xmath183 in an n - doped material ,",
    "then @xmath184 can be assumed to be negligibly small and electron generation from the defect states can be ignored in the above equation .",
    "process ( i ) and process ( ii ) can have comparable magnitudes@xcite .",
    "so , ignoring emission processes , the rate equation for the electron density becomes , @xmath185 @xmath98 and @xmath186 are the rate constants for electron capture by the defect state corresponding to processes ( i ) and ( ii ) in figure [ fig : auger ] , respectively . in our experiments , since our mos@xmath4 sample is n - doped , the first term of the right hand side is more important for small pump fluence values ( when the hole density is small ) compared to the second term . for large pump fluence values , both the electron and the hole densities can become comparable and the second term on the right hand side may not be ignored .",
    "however , at large pump fluences the effect of the second term is indistinguishable from the first term in our pump - probe experiments ( since both terms would result in the inverse electron capture time to increase linearly with the photoexcited carrier density ) .",
    "since the pump fluences used in our experiments are relatively small ( and the maximum photoexcited carrier density is in the low @xmath187 @xmath106 ) , we have chosen to ignore the second term , corresponding to process ( ii ) , in the above equation for simplicity .",
    "similarly , ignoring emission processes , the rate equation for the hole density becomes , @xmath188 here , @xmath74 is the hole density . @xmath189 and @xmath99 are the rate constants for hole capture by the defect state corresponding to processes ( iii ) and ( iv ) in figure [ fig : auger ] , respectively .",
    "again , since our mos@xmath4 sample is n - doped and the pump fluences used in our experiments are small , we have chosen to ignore the second term , corresponding to process ( iv ) , in the above equation for simplicity ."
