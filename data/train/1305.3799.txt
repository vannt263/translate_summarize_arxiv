    "being less bound than its two even - even neighbors , @xmath0xe and @xmath0ba , the odd - odd @xmath15cs@xmath16 nucleus can not be populated by @xmath17 decay , at variance to most of the odd - odd nuclei in the nuclide chart .",
    "thus , the @xmath0cs nuclei were produced for the first time by spallation of la and by fission of u , induced by 600 mev proton beams  @xcite .",
    "this led to the identification of two states , the ground state with @xmath18=13.16  d decaying to excited states of @xmath0ba and an isomeric state with @xmath18=19  s. the latter was measured from the cs x - rays , meaning that the isomeric state decays to the ground state via one converted transition at least .",
    "moreover the spin values of these two states were obtained from laser spectroscopy , @xmath19 for the ground state and @xmath20 for the isomeric state .",
    "very recently , the excitation energy of the isomeric state was determined thanks to the measurement of its decay to the ground state by means of a 518-kev @xmath21 transition  @xcite .",
    "moreover a very weak branch ( a 413  kev @xmath22 transition ) populating an intermediate state at 105  kev has been also measured .",
    "the ground state and the first excited state were then assigned to belong to the multiplet of states with the @xmath23 configuration , while the isomeric level would be the 8@xmath24 state from the @xmath25 configuration  @xcite .",
    "the high - spin structures built above the @xmath20 isomeric state remain unknown , while such structures with only one neutron hole in the @xmath26 orbit , i.e. , the unique high-@xmath10 orbit lying below the @xmath27 gap , are expected to be simple enough to provide important tests for shell - model calculations . a first candidate for this purpose",
    "is @xmath28i@xmath29 , unfortunately such a test is very limited as a unique structure comprising five excited states was measured and discussed in this odd - odd nucleus  @xcite .",
    "in the present paper , we report on the first identification of the high - spin states of @xmath0cs , produced as fission fragment in two fusion reactions , @xmath1o + @xmath2pb and @xmath3c + @xmath4u , and studied with the euroball array .",
    "the level scheme has been built up to @xmath64.7  mev excitation energy and up to spin values around @xmath30 .",
    "the yrast states are first discussed in comparison with the proton excitations already identified in @xmath8cs@xmath9  @xcite .",
    "then the predictions from shell - model calculations using the sn100pn effective interaction  @xcite are presented , showing a good agreement with experimental results .",
    "the @xmath0cs nuclei were obtained as fission fragments in two experiments .",
    "first , the @xmath3c + @xmath4u reaction was studied at 90 mev incident energy , with a beam provided by the legnaro xtu tandem accelerator .",
    "second , the @xmath1o + @xmath2pb reaction was studied with a 85 mev incident energy beam provided by the vivitron accelerator of ires ( strasbourg ) .",
    "the gamma rays were detected with the euroball array  @xcite .",
    "the spectrometer contained 15 cluster germanium detectors placed in the backward hemisphere with respect to the beam , 26 clover germanium detectors located around 90@xmath31 and 30 tapered single - crystal germanium detectors located at forward angles .",
    "each cluster detector consists of seven closely packed large - volume ge crystals  @xcite and each clover detector consists of four smaller ge crystals  @xcite . in order",
    "to get rid of the doppler effect , both experiments have been performed with thick targets in order to stop the recoiling nuclei ( 47 mg/@xmath32 for @xmath4u and 100 mg/@xmath32 for @xmath2pb targets , respectively ) .    the data of the c+u experiment were recorded in an event - by - event mode with the requirement that a minimum of five unsuppressed ge detectors fired in prompt coincidence .",
    "a set of 1.9@xmath33 three- and higher - fold events was available for a subsequent analysis .",
    "for the o+pb experiment , a lower trigger condition ( three unsuppressed ge ) allowed us to register 4@xmath34 events with a @xmath5-fold greater than or equal to 3 . the offline analysis consisted of both multigated spectra and three - dimensional cubes built and analyzed with the radware package  @xcite .",
    "more than one hundred nuclei are produced at high spin in such fusion - fission experiments , and this gives several thousands of @xmath5 transitions which have to be sorted out .",
    "single - gated spectra are useless in most of the cases .",
    "the selection of one particular nucleus needs at least two energy conditions , implying that at least two transitions have to be known .",
    "the identification of transitions depopulating high - spin levels which are completely unknown is based on the fact that prompt @xmath5-rays emitted by complementary fragments are detected in coincidence @xcite . for the reactions used in this work , we have studied many pairs of complementary fragments with known @xmath5-ray cascades to establish the relationships between their number of protons and neutrons @xcite .",
    "this was taken into account for identifying the @xmath5-ray cascades emitted by the @xmath0cs nucleus , as shown in the forthcoming section .",
    "in order to identify the unknown transitions depopulating high - spin levels located above the 8@xmath24 isomeric state of the odd - odd @xmath0cs isotope , we have first looked into spectra gated by the first transitions of its main complementary fragments , @xmath35br in the o+pb reaction and @xmath36tc in the c+u reaction .",

    "this allowed us to identify unambiguously two other transitions emitted by the high - spin states of @xmath0cs , at 262 and 730  kev , which are also weakly observed in spectra gated by two transitions belonging to the complementary fragments .",
    "then the coincidence relationships of the 262- , 730- , and 1398-kev transitions have been carefully analyzed in order to identify the other transitions having lower intensity .",

    "nevertheless the order of the 66- and 1398-kev transitions could not be disentangled unambiguously , as the uncertainty on @xmath41 obtained in spectra gated by transitions belonging to the complementary fragments is too large .",

    "we have extracted the internal conversion electron coefficients of the 66- and 121-kev transitions by analyzing the relative intensities of transitions in cascade .",

    "@xcite , the 8@xmath24 isomeric state belongs to the @xmath54 configuration .",
    "the @xmath55 state lies above it .",

    "[ see the red filled squares in fig .  [ calculs_sm](a ) ] , the odd proton is located in the @xmath13 orbit and one or two @xmath12 pairs are broken .",
    "on the other hand , the states having an odd number of protons in the @xmath12 orbit have higher excitation energies [ see the blue filled circles in fig .  [ calculs_sm](a ) ] .",
    "thus the states of structure 1 with @xmath47 to ( 16@xmath24 ) ( see fig .",

    "it is worth pointing out that , taking into account the fact that the 10@xmath24 state of configuration 2 is predicted to lie below the 11@xmath24 state of configuration 1 , one could infer that this 11@xmath24 yrast state mainly decays towards the 10@xmath24 state of configuration 2 instead of towards the 9@xmath59 state",
    ". such an assumption would be in agreement with the experimental results provided that the order of the 66- and 1398-kev transitions is reversed ( as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ result ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , since the configuration of the 11@xmath59 state is different from both the 10@xmath59 and 9@xmath59 states , its decay to the lowest state ( 9@xmath59 ) , very favored by the large transition energy , is more likely , meaning that the 1398-kev transition is located above the 66-kev one .",
    "the fact that the 12@xmath24 state of the configuration 2 decays towards the 11@xmath24 state of the configuration 1 can be explained by the high energy of the transition .",
    "thus the predicted 11@xmath24 and 10@xmath24 states of the @xmath58 configuration could not be observed experimentally in this work .",
    "the promotion of one proton to the @xmath14 orbit leads to multiplets of states with positive parity . while the predicted @xmath60 states of the @xmath61 configuration",
    "have a too large excitation energy to be populated in our experiment , we can expect to observe the @xmath62 states due to the breaking of a proton pair , i.e. , from the @xmath63 configuration with a proton seniority of 3 [ see the green plus symbols in fig .",
    "[ calculs_sm](a ) ] .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental states of structure 3 ( see fig .",
    "[ schemacs136 ] ) .    in conclusion",
    ", the use of the sn100pn effective interaction gives a good description of the yrast states of the odd - odd @xmath0cs .",
    "nevertheless it has to be mentioned that the predicted spectrum is slightly more compressed than the experimental one [ compare figs .",

    "they confirm that three high - spin structures observed above @xmath6  2  mev are due to the odd proton lying in one of the three orbits coupled to one or two broken proton pairs in the two close orbits ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) , the odd neutron being a spectator .",
