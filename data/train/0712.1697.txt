    "@xmath0 cir ( hd 128898 ) is the prototype of a class of ap stars that oscillate in high frequencies ( roap , rapidly oscillating ap , @xcite ) . besides knowing its effective temperature and parallaxe , to accurately place @xmath0 cir in the hr diagram it is necessary to know also its bolometric correction ( @xmath1 ) . to determine the latter ,",
    "the method proposed by @xcite was applied .",
    "the @xmath1 is given by the equation ,      where @xmath3 is the apparent visual magnitude and @xmath4 is the flux at a given wavelength .",
    "two values for the integrated flux of @xmath0 cir were obtained .",
    "the first was determined by combining the observed ultraviolet flux of @xmath0 cir retrieved from iue newly extracted spectra ( ines ) data archive , with the theoretical flux obtained from the kurucz model ( with idl routine kurget1 ) that best fitted the optical photometry ( @xcite ) for the star .",
    "the second was obtained using the same method , but substituting the kurucz synthetic spectrum by the mean of two low resolution spectra of @xmath0 cir calibrated in flux ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the two values obtained for the @xmath1 were @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . to place @xmath0 cir in the h.r .",
    "diagram , the results obtained for the bolometric fluxes were combined with the hipparcos parallaxe . for the effective temperature we adopted the value from @xcite , @xmath7 k.     cir in the hr diagram with four evolution tracks for models with masses of 1.70 , 1.73 , 1.75 and 1.80 m@xmath8 for comparison .",
    "the two error boxes correspond to two values of the luminosity ( and associated error ) derived from two different bolometric fluxes ( see text for details).,width=264 ]    both values derived for the @xmath1 have uncertainties that go beyond their formal errors . in the first case , uncertainties are likely associated with the use of kurucz models which are not apropriate for peculiar stars . in the second case ,",
    "additional uncertainties are also expected because the errors associated with the calibration in flux of the low resolution spectra were not provided in the catalogues .",
    "hence , we took a conservative approach and considered both values when placing the star in the hr diagram .",
