    "the prediction of a scale invariant scalar and tensor perturbations @xcite from inflation @xcite rest on the assumption of a bunch - davies initial state in conformal coordinates of de sitter space @xcite .",
    "an observer in a different coordinate system , for instance an inertial observer in the static coordinates , will see the same perturbations as a thermal distribution with a gibbons - hawking temperature @xmath5 @xcite due to mode - mixing between the bunch - davies modes and eigenmodes of the static coordinates @xcite .",
    "another way by which the scale invariant perturbations produced during inflation can appear as a thermal distribution is when one considers the mode mixing due to the change in observer between the conformal observer during inflation and the asymptotic minkowski observer in future which measure the perturbations @xcite .",
    "variations of the standard bunch - davies state can be of phenomenological interest as a way of reconciling the large value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio implied by the b - mode polarization measurement by the bicep2 collaboration with the lower upper bound established by planck from the temperature anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the bicep2 collaboration @xcite reported a tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath6 by the measurement of the b - mode polarization @xcite , which is in apparent contradiction with the upper bound @xmath7 ( at @xmath8 cl ) placed by planck @xcite from the measurement of the tt spectrum .",
    "there is no direct contradiction between these two measurements as bicep2 is most sensitive at @xmath9 corresponding to a hub of @xmath10 while the planck 2013 measurement uses the hub @xmath11 which corresponds to @xmath12 .",
    "however explaining the two measurements in a model of inflation would require ( 1 ) a blue tilted tensor spectrum with spectral index @xmath13 @xcite or ( 2 ) a running of the scalar spectrum @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "either of the possible ways to explain the planck-2013 and bicep2 data simultaneously would require going beyond the single field inflation with bunch - davies initial state .",
    "subsequently the dust popularization measurement reported by planck-2014 @xcite has diminished the statistical significance of the bicep2 measurement but not ruled it out @xcite .",
    "there is a possibility that the measurement of the b - mode polarization in other experiments ( like keck , sptpol etc ) may result in a value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio which still calls for a non - standard interpretation of the inflationary power spectrum to evade the standard consistency relation @xmath15 of the standard single field inflation .    in this paper",
    "we show that if we assume a mode mixing between the bunch - davies initial vacuum and the post - inflation final vacuum and the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the mode - mixing is of the thermal form @xmath18 with the gibbons - hawking temperature @xmath19 , then the spectral index of tensor modes will be blue - tilted with @xmath20 . on the other hand",
    "if we assume that the out observer is the one with the static coordinates , then the bogoliubov coefficients again give the same thermal distribution with identical @xmath21 , however , the spectral index in this case is red - tilted @xmath22 .",
    "the difference in the spectral tilt between the two cases is due to the fact that when we transform the initial state from the conformal to static coordinates we have @xmath23 while the transformation between the conformal coordinates and the asymptotic minkowski coordinates of the late time observer gives @xmath24 .",
    "the difference in sign of @xmath25 with the same @xmath26 results in a different spectral tilt . in order to avoid the successful prediction of the scale invariant scalar power spectrum",
    ", we will assume that the slow roll parameter @xmath27 of the scalar potential is negative so that the scalar modes are tachyonic and the hawking radiation of scalar modes is suppressed @xcite .",
    "we do a likelihood analysis for the values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio for the case of red and blue tilted spectra and determine the slow roll parameters of the model which would be reconcile the b - mode and tt anisotropy data .",
    "we conclude that mode mixing between the bunch - davies vacuum and the vacuum state of the observer , may resolve the tension between the planck-2013 bound and bicep2 measurement and the accurate experimental measurement of the spectral index can determine the nature of the initial state of the inflation generated perturbations .",
    "we can express the tensor perturbations @xmath28 as a quantum field in terms of the mode functions @xmath29 ( which satisfies the minimally coupled klein - gordon equation ) as h(*x*,t)= ( a_k _ in k+ a_k^ _ in k^ ) , [ bdexprs ] where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of the particles in the conformal vacuum , also called the bunch - davies vacuum , which we will denote by @xmath32 and which is defined by @xmath33 .",
    "( [ bdexprs ] ) is written in terms of the spherical polar coordinates .",
