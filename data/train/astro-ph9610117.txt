    "the observed radial velocity of a galaxy is    @xmath1\\cdot ( { \\bf d}/d ) \\eqno ( 1)\\ ] ]    where * v*@xmath2 is the peculiar velocity vector , * d * is the vector distance to the galaxy and @xmath3 its modulus .",
    "the tully  fisher ( tf ) technique yields estimates of @xmath4 and @xmath5 can generally be obtained directly and with high accuracy from a galaxy s spectrum .",
    "if the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation dipole moment is interpreted as a doppler shift resulting from the motion of the local group with respect to the comoving reference frame , @xmath6 can be inferred from the cmb dipole and the peculiar velocity of the galaxy can be obtained from eqn .",
    "( 1 ) , independently on any assumption regarding the value of @xmath7 . in this paper",
    "we shall often refer to @xmath4 as `` distance '' , with the understanding that such quantity is intended expressed in .",
    "the necessary ingredients in this operation are a set of photometric and spectroscopic data and a template tf relation , which is empirically derived .",
    "clusters of galaxies are favorite targets for applications of the tf technique of determining redshift  independent distances @xmath4 for two important reasons .",
    "first , a cluster provides a large number of objects located at a common distance , thereby allowing the determination of a tf relation slope which will be exempt from the vagaries that are introduced by an _ a priori _ unknown peculiar velocity field in a field galaxy sample .",
    "clusters are thus well suited for the generation of a tf template relation .",
    "second , the combination of independent distance estimates of several galaxies in a cluster provides a more accurate determination of the cluster distance : to the extent that @xmath8 galaxies in a cluster can be considered to be at the same distance , the cluster distance can be found @xmath9 times more accurately than as determined for a single galaxy .",
    "sampled clusters and groups can thus provide `` hard points '' in a map of the large scale peculiar velocity field .",
    "seminal work in the determination of redshift  independent cluster distances was carried out in the 1980 s by aaronson and co  workers ( 1983,1986,1989 ) , using a version of the tf relation that utilized h band aperture photometry , an approach thought to minimize the amplitude of internal extinction corrections and therefore to reduce the scatter that determines the ultimate accuracy of the distance determination technique .",
    "more recently , it has become common practice to carry out surface photometry for tf work using i or r band ccd images .",
    "the sky background at those wavelengths is still relatively low ( as compared to h and k bands ) , detectors have high efficiency and large fields of view , and data acquisition is relatively fast even with small aperture telescopes .",
    "the population dominating the light at i band is comprised of stars that are several gyr old .",
    "thus , disks are well outlined but of smoother appearance than as seen in blue portions of the visible spectrum , and their apparent inclinations to the line of sight can be more reliably determined .",
    "in addition , the processes operating in clusters that may alter the star formation rate in galaxies will have a very retarded effect on the red and infrared light of disks ; thus , smaller  if any  systematic differences are expected between the i and r tf relation of cluster and field galaxies ( pierce and tully 1992 ) .",
    "recent ccd tf cluster work includes the surveys of pierce and tully ( 1988 ; hereafter pt88 ) , han ( 1992 ) han and mould ( 1992 ) , hereafter jointly referred to as hm , schommer ( 1993 ) , mathewson ( 1992 ; hereafter mfb ) and bernstein ( 1994 )",
    ".    published cluster samples suffer from a number of limitations :    \\(i ) spirals are rare in the central parts of clusters and , when found there , are often gas deficient , especially in the outer disk where rotation curves tend to flatten . as a result , hi and optical emission line measurements of rotational speeds are scarce and difficult to obtain in cluster cores .",
    "\\(ii ) high velocity resolution hi emission work , even for spirals of normal gas content , becomes arduous at redshifts larger than few thousand with most radio telescopes , except for a few ( arecibo , nanay ) that are jointly unable to reach the whole sky .",
    "thus galaxies with tf distance measurements tend to be the brightest in the cluster , and tf cluster samples mix optical and radio widths .",
    "\\(iii ) in order to maximize sample size , cluster membership assignment has sometimes been made with relatively lax criteria : galaxies in tf cluster samples have tended to be representatives of an extended supercluster population rather than strict cluster members . as observations of increasing sensitivity",
    "are made and the data base of cluster galaxy tf distances grows , it becomes possible and desirable to apply stricter membership criteria , significantly improving the quality of the determination of both the parameters of the tf template relation and of the motions of individual clusters .    as a complement to a program to map the local peculiar velocity field via tf distance measures of approximately 2000 field spirals ( giovanelli 1994 , hereinafter paper i , giovanelli 1995 : paper ii , freudling 1995 : paper iii , giovanelli 1996a : paper iv , da costa 1996 : paper v ) , we present here the results of a tf survey restricted to cluster galaxies suitable both for the determination of a template tf relation and for the determination of the amplitude of the motions of the clusters themselves . extending previous work , in this study",
    "we utilize a larger data base , strict membership criteria for the definition of cluster samples , as well as recent determinations of correction recipes for the observed tf parameters ( papers i and ii ) .",
    "the data base presented here contains both new photometric and spectroscopic data for several hundred galaxies , and the results of the reprocessing of relevant data available in the public domain .",
    "the observational data are utilized to produce a tf template and to investigate cluster motions in a companion paper ( giovanelli 1996b , hereinafter referred to as paper vii ) .    in section 2",
    ", we discuss the cluster selection and the data sets used . in section 3 , we present the individual galaxy parameters . in sections 4 , 5 and 6",
    "we discuss the procedures followed to derive disk inclinations , velocity widths and i band fluxes .",
    "the global properties of the cluster galaxy sample are investigated in section 7 , while cluster membership assignment issues are discussed in section 8 .    throughout this work ,",
    "we parametrize distance dependent parameters by assuming a distance scale @xmath10 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "whenever explicit dependence on @xmath12 is not made , a value of @xmath13 is assumed .",
    "in this section , we discuss alternative strategies for deriving the template relation and , in particular , the approach we have taken .",
    "note that a template tf relation for the measurement of peculiar velocities requires an accurate estimation of a _ velocity zero point _ , which can be obtained independently on any assumption for , or knowledge of the value of the hubble constant .",
    "ideally , the objects entering the definition of the tf template will be globally at rest in the comoving reference frame , assumed to be the one where the cmb dipole moment vanishes .    while the use of local calibrators with reliable estimates of primary distances is necessary if the tf relation is used for the determination of the hubble constant , it is of no consequence in defining a peculiar velocity tf template .",
    "since only a handful of galaxies with primary distances exist , which can also be profitably used for tf work , they allow a determination of the tf zero point to no better than @xmath14 mag . note that a tf template relation with @xmath14 mag distance modulus predictive accuracy is clearly unsatisfactory for the measurement of the velocity field , as it would introduce large , spurious and systematic peculiar velocities of growing amplitude in the outer regions of any sampled volume .",
    "one commonly  adopted approach to the determination of a tf template relation is to select a single cluster of galaxies as a reference , thereby equating the universal template with the tf relation defined by its member galaxies ( pt88 ; mfb ) . in this instance",
    ", all cluster members are assumed to be at approximately the same distance from the observer as predicted by the systemic velocity of the cluster , and their relative locations in the tf diagram are assumed to be unaffected by peculiar motions .",
    "this strategy requires that the cluster be endowed with several special qualities : ( a ) a substantial number of individual galaxy distances must be measurable for that cluster , either by virtue of its large spiral population or of its proximity ; ( b ) there must be a reasonable expectation that the cluster is at rest in the comoving reference frame ; ( c ) there must be strong reasons to believe that the cluster s tf relation is a particularly good approximation to the true one .",
    "the practical advantages of having a tf relation defined by a large sample of objects , as required by ( a ) , are obvious ; the likelihood that a reliable template can be obtained from a _ single _ cluster is however questionable on statistical grounds .",
    "consider the case of a nearby cluster first .",
    "we assume that a cluster tf relation is a random realization of some universal relation , defined by a zero offset and a slope .",
    "uncertainty is contributed by the limited accuracy of measurements , by an intrinsic amount of scatter in galaxies properties and by the _ a priori _ unknown amplitude of the cluster motion with respect to the comoving reference frame .",
    "if the number of observed galaxies is large and the dynamic range in the observed parameters high , then the slope of the universal relation should be increasingly well approximated by that of the chosen cluster .",
    "these requirements favor the selection of a nearby cluster in which the fainter galaxies are more easily observable .",
    "the uncertainty on the offset or zero point of the tf relation can also be initially reduced by increasing the size of the sample .",
    "however , the limit of this process depends on the amplitude of the cluster motion itself , and for a given amplitude , the introduced uncertainty increases with cluster proximity . in other words , if the chosen cluster is nearby , the tf zero point uncertainty remains very high , independent of the size of the sample .",
    "note that the uncertainties on the tf zero point and slope are coupled quantities .",
    "consider now the case of a distant cluster , where the average single ",
    "point scatter about a best fit linear relation is on the order of a third of a magnitude .",
    "a typical tf cluster sample may include two dozen galaxies , so that the cluster zero offset can be determined to better than 0.1 mag . a cluster motion of 300  about half the velocity of the lg with respect to the cmb reference frame ",
    "translates into an offset of the cluster tf relation smaller than 0.1 mag only if the cluster is at @xmath15 .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ validity to expecting that the desired quality ( b ) listed above may hold for any given cluster .",
    "if we were to use a single cluster as reference , we would then be forced to use a distant one , which would limit both the number and the dynamic range in luminosity of the sampled galaxies .",
    "a more attractive approach is that of building a template by combining data of many clusters .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that the mean motion of a `` basket of clusters '' , if well distributed over all the sky , approximates null velocity better than any single cluster .",
    "the tf relation parameters can be statistically better determined , as the larger number of objects sampled help to reduce statistical uncertainties .",
    "nearby clusters in the set play an important role in the definition of the template slope , while the more distant clusters allow a fairer definition of the kinematical zero point . in order",
    "for the tf relation of each cluster to be adequately `` spliced '' to that of the others , it is necessary to ascertain its peculiar velocity with respect to the reference frame defined by the cluster set .",
    "convinced of the superiority of this approach , we have thus assembled tf data for 24 clusters of galaxies . in their majority , the data are new , and obtained by us at the observatories of arecibo , palomar , mdm , kitt peak , cerro tololo , green bank and nanay . the raw data , details of the observing schedules and data reduction techniques",
    "will be given in separate papers .",
    "here we present the final parameters , in a stage ready for utilization in astrophysical applications .",
    "the clusters are all relatively nearby ; their systemic velocities , as measured in the cmb reference frame , are all less than 10,000 .",
    "they span a large range in richness : the sample includes dynamically evolved structures such as the coma cluster and loose groups such as mdl59 .",
    "it should be admitted that an important criterion for selection was one of expediency , i.e. a group or cluster may have been included in the sample if high quality velocity widths and i band photometry were available for a substantial number of member galaxies .",
    "we have not used certain clusters or groups , which have appeared in other cluster lists , for a variety of reasons . if photometry was not available in the i band , and thus it could not be reprocessed according to the same precepts followed for our sample , we preferred to forego the uncertain task of cross  calibration of data of various optical bands .",
    "in few cases in which i band data was available , after our cluster membership criteria were applied the number of remaining galaxies with measured distances for the cluster or group was so small ( or cluster definition so uncertain ) that the structure did not constitute a worthwhile addition .",
    "for example , the cluster a534 , for which a significant amount of data is available , including our own , is at very low galactic latitudes .",
    "although the size of the data set and cluster definition would warrant its use , the very high uncertainty and clumpiness in the extinction arising within our galaxy make the data set currently unfit for tf calibration use .",
    "a significant amount of data is also available for the sculptor group .",
    "this is a nearby group , for which a cepheid distance modulus of 26.5@xmath16 has been measured for one of its brightest members ( ngc 300 ; freedman 1991 ) ; however , the group appears to be quite extended along the line of sight , perhaps as much as 2 mag in distance modulus ( pierce and tully 1992 ) .",
    "we have thus chosen to exclude it from our sample .",
    "the virgo cluster , nearby and well studied , exhibits very significant substructure , and will be the object of a successive focused study by our group .",
    "we were also guided by the second important criterion that the sample should be as balanced as possible between contributions from different parts of the sky .",
    "spatial balance in the cluster sample is required so that the kinematical zero point of the tf template , the derivation of which we describe in paper vii , will be as closely as possible consistent with null velocity with respect to the cmb .",
    "we have been partly succesful , although the more distant clusters in the sample are principally located in the northern hemisphere .",
    "three stereographic views of the distribution of the 24 clusters are presented in figure 1 , where their locations are in cartesian supergalactic coordinates @xmath17 , expressed in as measured in the cmb reference frame ( kogut 1993 ) .",
    "the conversion of cluster centers and systemic velocities to @xmath17 is done using the apex parameters as given in the rc3 ( de vaucouleurs 1993 ) , and it does not correct the coordinates for the clusters peculiar velocities .",
    "table 1 lists the main parameters of the chosen clusters .",
    "standard names are listed in column 1 ; in a few cases ( ngc 383 , ngc 507 , ngc 3557 ) , the group is identified by the name of the most prominent galaxy . adopted coordinates of the cluster center",
    "are listed in columns 2 and 3 , for the epoch 1950 ; they are in general obtained from the same sources yielding cluster redshifts , except in a few cases discussed in section 8 .",

    "when a source for the cluster parameters is not given in table 1 , it should be assumed that we have rederived them using compilations of redshift data , which occasionally include a richer data set than used in the most recent published analyses of those groups or clusters .",
    "available redshift data have also been used in the assignment of cluster membership to individual galaxies .",
    "for the i band photometry , we adopt data from several sources .",
    "the main ones are : ( a ) our own survey of cluster and field objects , carried out using the mdm 1.3 m and the kitt peak 0.9 m telescopes ( the raw data and the technical details of these observations will be presented elsewhere ) ; ( b ) the data sets published by hm and ( c ) that of mfb . in the case of the ursa major cluster , we make extensive use of the data of pt88 .    for the velocity width data ,",
    "the main sources of observational material are : ( a ) our own 21 cm and optical rotation curve data obtained at several telescopes , namely arecibo , green bank ( both 300 foot and 140 foot telescopes ) , nanay , effelsberg and palomar ( the raw data and the technical details of these observations will be presented elsewhere ) ; ( b ) the data set of mfb and of numerous other sources of 21 cm widths .    observed raw parameters of all data sets",
    "have been reprocessed , converting them into a homogeneous sample , to which a consistent set of correction algorithms has been applied .",
    "details of those corrections are given in sections 4 to 6 .",

    "the second galaxy name is added with the following priority scheme : if the galaxy has an ngc or ic number , that coding is entered preferentially ; if the galaxy is listed in the cgcg ( zwicky 1968 ) , that coding is listed with second priority , in the form : field number  ordinal number within the field ; for southern galaxies , if an ngc or ic number is not available , the lauberts ( 1982 ) catalog name is entered .",

    "col . 7 : membership code .",
    "in most cases the code consists of one of 4 letters : _ c , g , f , b_. code _ c _ signifies that the galaxy is considered a _ bona fide _ cluster member ( * in * sample ) .",
    "means that the galaxy is sufficiently removed from the cluster center that cluster membership can not be safely assigned ; the galaxy is however in the periphery of the cluster , at roughly the same redshift and it is a nearby supercluster member ( * in+ * sample )",
    "f _ and _ b _ identify respectively foreground and background galaxies ; these will not be used in the construction of the cluster tf relation in any form .",
    "criteria adopted to arrive at the membership assignment are discussed in greater detail in the section 8 . in some clusters , additional codes had to be used , due to the complex nature of the structure .",
    "we describe those codes separately below .    in cancer",
    ", the cluster has been recognized to be an assembly of clumps , dubbed a , b , c , d ( bothun 1983 ) .",
    "we use the criteria given in that reference to assign membership to each of the clumps , and used correspondingly capital letters a , b , c and d as membership identifiers . in the remainder of this paper , when mention is made to `` cancer cluster members '' , we refer to members of clump a , the largest of the system . in figure 5 ,",
    "members of the other clumps in the region are plotted as unfilled squares ( d clumo ) and triangles ( clumps b and c ) .    in centaurus ( a3526 ) , lucey ( 1986 and references therein ) recognized the existence of two structures superimposed along the line of sight , concentric in projection , with systemic velocities respectively near 3,000 and near 4,500 , thus referred to as cen30 and cen45 .",

    "we have assigned membership preferentially to cen45 , in order to keep the cen30 sample as `` clean '' as possible .",
    "it is thus likely that some of the objects assigned to cen45 are cen30 members ; they are thus footnoted . in the remainder of the paper , when a3526 cluster members are mentioned",

    "for galaxies for which we had available access to the i band images , inclinations were obtained after fitting ellipses to isophotal contours using the isophote routine in stsdas , as described in paper i. from these isophotal fits , one can obtain an ellipticity  defined as @xmath37 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the major and minor axes of the ellipse  as a function of the distance @xmath38 from the center of the galaxy .",
    "a range of radial distances is then chosen over which the disk appears to be exponential , and a mean value of the ellipticity @xmath39 is obtained .",
    "this parameter yields a first order approximation to the true ellipticity of the image , which needs to be corrected for the effects of resolution , mainly the smearing effects of seeing .",
    "we assume that the disk light drops to half power near @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively along the major and minor axes , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the major and minor isophotal sizes at the 23.5 i mag sec@xmath35 isophote ; this results from the fact that , statistically , @xmath42 is about equal to 3.5 scale lengths .",
    "then if @xmath44 , where hpfw@xmath45 is the size of the seeing disk for the given observation , we adopt as the corrected ellipticity    @xmath46    in order to avoid overcorrection , we limit @xmath47 to not exceed a maximum value of @xmath48 , and assume @xmath47 is a good approximation of the true value of @xmath49 . in the following ,",
    "when we refer to @xmath49 , we mean the corrected value given by eqn .",
    "( 2 ) , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the inclination angle is then derived as    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the intrinsic axial ratio of spiral disks , which are treated as highly oblate spheroids . for sbc and sc galaxies ,",
    "we adopt @xmath52 , as discussed in paper i ; for other types we adopt a more conservative @xmath53 .    in the published literature",
    ", inclinations have occasionally been obtained using criteria different from our own . both mfb and hm , for example ,",
    "adopt an intrinsic disk axial ratio of 0.2 for all types . in those cases ,",
    "we rederive an axial ratio from the published inclination , and use it to estimate the inclination according to our choice of intrinsic axial ratio @xmath51 .",
    "a problem with this approach is that published inclinations obtained using @xmath53 yield values of @xmath49 that saturate at 0.80 ; for a @xmath52 , that ellipticity yields an inclination of @xmath54 . in the case of mfb , in addition to inclinations also axial ratios are given , so that the ambiguity can be partially solved : whenever their published inclination is @xmath55 ( which would yield @xmath54 for a @xmath52 ) , we recompute the ellipticity from their reported axial ratio , and use it to estimate the inclination , with the value of @xmath51 appropriate to our convention . in the case of",
    "hm s data , axial ratios are not available , and inclinations reported at @xmath55 are kept at that value , even if for a small fraction of objects such inclination may be a slight overestimate .",
    "no seeing corrections are attempted for data other than our own .",
    "uncertainty in the determination of the disk inclination propagates to variables on both axes of the tf diagram .",
    "the correction to magnitude for internal extinction increases with increasing inclination angle , while the correction to the observed velocity widths is largest for systems closer to face  on .",
    "as ellipses were fitted to each galaxy image , we estimated errors in the determination of @xmath49 for our data , which include not only the cluster galaxies listed in table 2 but also a larger field sample of late  type spirals . in figure 13 , we display the errors @xmath56 , as derived from our data , plotted versus @xmath49 .",
    "a trend is discernible in the sense that @xmath56 increases with decreasing @xmath49 .",
    "the solid line superimposed on the data    @xmath57    yields an estimate of the expected ( median ) error associated with the ellipticity .",
    "we can use eqn .",
    "( 4 ) in the computation of the error @xmath56 for sources of data other than ours , for which values of the ellipticity or axial ratio are given without an indication of the associated error .",
    "the distribution of inclination errors shows considerable skewness and kurtosis , especially for low values of the inclination .",
    "this combined effect can arise from isophotal maps strongly affected by the light of a bar , the presence of an undetected warp , or other disk distortions .",
    "the velocity widths have been obtained at several different telescopes , using both radio and optical long  slit techniques .",
    "all the radio spectra have been reduced within the same system .",
    "techniques and algorithms applied in the reduction of our data , as well as comparisons with other data sets are described elsewhere ( haynes 1997 ) .",
    "here we are mainly concerned with the details related with the characterization of the velocity  width error budget .",
    "our 21 cm velocity widths were measured using an algorithm that fits the rising sides of the galaxian profile with low order polynomials and obtains the width at a 50% level of each of the profile horn peaks or single peak , depending on the line shape .",
    "similar techniques have been applied in data drawn from other sources , and we have applied each of the standard techniques to our data as well , and derived recursion relations to convert widths from other sources to our standard . in order to derive a measure of the disk maximum rotational velocity from the observed 21 cm profile width , a number of corrections need to be applied .    first , the broadening effects produced by the instrumental characteristics , the signal  to  noise ratio ( s / n ) of the spectrum and any smoothing that may have been applied in order to improve the ( s / n ) need to be accounted for .",
    "these broadening processes depend on the shape of the spectral line , i.e. the steepness of the `` horns '' .",
    "second , both turbulent and ordered motions contribute to the profile width .",
    "we assume that ordered motions are fully produced by rotation , and attempt no corrections related to large scale phenomena such as warps of the disk , noncircular orbits and motions perpendicular to the disk plane .",
    "we statistically correct only for the contributions of turbulent motions .",
    "third , the observed profile is broadened in the measure @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the redshift of the source , by relativistic effects .",
    "fourth , the doppler observations refer to the line of sight projections of the gas motions .",
    "the amplitude of ordered motions occurring in the plane of the disk can be obtained from the observed values when the inclination angle @xmath24 , between the normal to the plane of the disk and the line of sight , is known .",
    "the _ corrected _ velocity width will then be    @xmath60^{1/2 } { 1\\over{\\sin i } } \\eqno ( 5)\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 is the observed 21 cm width and @xmath62 is the correction for the effects of instrumental broadening and of any smoothing applied in the reduction stage .",
    "the latter term also takes into account the distortions that result with varying ( s / n ) and a dependence on the observed shape of the line profile .",
    "the term @xmath63 accounts for the broadening produced by turbulent motions , and the factor @xmath64 deprojects the disk .",
    "each one of the correction steps adds a measure of uncertainty to the determination of the velocity width , which needs to be carefully tracked since , as we shall see , they constitute one of the principal contributions to scatter in the tf diagram .",
    "let the measurement of the spectrum yield a width @xmath61 , with an associated error on the measurement @xmath65 .    based on our own numerical simulations , we assume that the uncertainty associated with the quantities @xmath62 and @xmath63 is approximately 25% of the value of each , i.e. @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath64 , the inclination correction , depends principally on the accuracy with which the disk ellipticity has been measured .",
    "the dependence of @xmath56 on @xmath49 is shown in figure 13 and parametrized by eqn .",
    "the error on the measurement of @xmath49 propagates to that in @xmath64 via    @xmath68 ^ 2 \\epsilon_e^2   \\eqno ( 6)\\ ] ]    where we have neglected the effect of the uncertainty on the value of @xmath51 .",
    "the uncertainty @xmath69 associated with @xmath70 is then    @xmath71    the relative error on the width , @xmath72 , increases with decreasing inclination , because the first two terms in eqn .",
    "( 7 ) are proportional to @xmath73 and because @xmath74 increases as the disk gets closer to face  on , as shown in figure 13 .",
    "similarly , @xmath72 increases with decreasing @xmath70 , because @xmath65 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are to the first order independent of width , and therefore constitute an increasingly large fraction of the width as @xmath70 decreases .",
    "this is shown in figure 14 .",
    "the relative importance of the various terms contributing to @xmath69 does of course depend on the inclination of the system . for highly inclined systems ,",
    "the uncertainty on @xmath24 does not play a very important role , while for systems with @xmath77 , the term in @xmath78 can be the most important .",
    "the terms in @xmath79 and @xmath80 seldom account for more than a quarter of the total error budget , and more often they account for less than 10% ; in addition , in most cases in which these terms account for more than 10% of the width error , the latter is usually quite small in absolute terms .",
    "thus , the simplicity of our approximation of @xmath79 and @xmath80 as constant fractions of the corrections @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively , is well justified ; a more elaborate parametrization of @xmath79 and @xmath80 is unnecessary .      for a sizable fraction of objects in our sample ,",
    "we use velocity widths obtained from optical , single slit spectroscopy . for these objects ,",
    "adequate 21 cm line profiles are generally unavailable .",
    "a comparison of optical and radio widths , and a detailed discussion of the derivation and treatment of both quantities is given elsewhere ( haynes 1997 ) .",
    "a number of corrections need to be applied to optical velocity widths ; some are similar to those applied to radio widths and described above , others are not , such as those responding to the _ ad hoc _ requisite that the corrected widths be compatible with those obtained via radio means .",
    "first we apply an additive offset @xmath81 to the observed or reported optical width , @xmath82 , such that this correction will make it equivalent to the radio width , corrected for instrumental , smoothing and signal  to  noise broadening effects .",
    "such offset depends principally on the adopted measuring technique and on the shape of the rotation curve , as discussed in haynes ( 1997 ) . because the hi widths tend to sample regions of disks that generally extend beyond the edge of the regions sampled by optical rotation curves , the offset between the two widths depends on the extent over which the spectrum spatially maps the disk , and on whether the rotation curve is seen to be still rising , flat , or falling at the outer parts of the disk sampled by the spectrum . in a reanalysis of the optical rotation curve data of mfb , persic and salucci ( 1996 )",
    "have adopted a velocity width measurement that corresponds to the value of the rotational speed at a radius @xmath83 within which 80% of the disk s i band light is enclosed .",
    "we also adopt here that criterion . for objects for which both optical rotation curve and 21 cm line data are available , the corrected 21 cm width and the optical width measured at @xmath83 provide a good match . for galaxies where the sampling of the optical spectrum does not reach as far out as @xmath83 , we extrapolate the rotation curve , using the parametrized `` universal rotation curve '' form of persic and salucci ( 1991 ) , as described in detail in haynes ( 1997 ) .",
    "a second offset correction would be necessary , in order to account for poor estimates of the position angle ( pa ) of disks major axes .",
    "this should always be an additive term , because any misestimate of the pa will generally reduce the measured width .",
    "an estimate of the error incurred in estimating the pa is difficult .",
    "we have simulated the effects of errors on the observed width by misalignment of the spectrograph slit , both in pa and in centering , and have found that the errors remain negligible for @xmath84 or so . given the uncertainty in estimating the pa error , we chose not to apply a correction for this effect .",
    "any net mean offset would be small , and would be incorporated in the @xmath81 term .    next ,",
    "a @xmath85 relativistic correction and an inclination correction are applied , as described for the radio widths in the preceding section .",
    "the corrected width derived from optical rotation curves is then    @xmath86    and the resulting uncertainty associated with @xmath70 is    @xmath87    where @xmath65 is the measurement uncertainty on @xmath82 , @xmath88 is the uncertainty on the shape dependent offset correction @xmath81 , the amplitude of which is very sensitive on whether @xmath82 is obtained from the rotation curve by interpolating between observed values or extrapolating beyond the last measured radius ; @xmath78 is the uncertainty on @xmath89 , as shown in the preceding section . for the widths derived from the data of mfb ,",
    "we have inferred uncertainties @xmath65 from the tabulation of folded and kinematically recentered rotation curves by persic and salucci ( 1996 ) .",
    "when we use data from sources other than ours , for which @xmath65 is not reported and for which a more informed estimate of the width error is not possible , we assume @xmath90 , an error typical for galaxies with measured errors .",
    "for all the objects used in this study , magnitudes derived from i band ccd images are available . in some cases , other photometric parameters , such as",
    "scale lengths and isophotal sizes , are also available .",
    "when scale lengths are measured , it is possible to infer an asymptotic magnitude , which results from extrapolating the `` curve of growth '' of isophotal magnitudes to infinity , assuming that the surface brightness falls exponentially with the measured scale length .",
    "such extrapolation is applied to the magnitude measured at an isophotal level between 23.5 and 24.0 mag arcsec@xmath11 ( which is found at a distance of @xmath91 scale lengths from the center of the galaxy ) , and it amounts typically to a few hundreds of a magnitude .",
    "we adopt such an asymptotal measure as our estimate of the i band flux .",
    "there is a significant offset in the mean values of the total uncorrected magnitude , between our own observations and those from the other main source utilized in this paper , i.e. those by mfb .",
    "we compare 217 galaxies for which both mfb and our magnitudes are available . of those , 196 have magnitude differences smaller than 0.3 magnitudes ; galaxies with magnitude discrepancies larger than 0.3 mag are not used further in comparing the two scales .",
    "the 196 galaxies yield a mean difference in the measured total magnitude of @xmath92 .",
    "this difference does however exhibit a systematic trend , in the sense that the difference becomes larger ( more negative ) for objects of brighter apparent magnitude .",
    "we tentatively attribute part of the effect to the fact that some of the observations of mfb of objects of relatively large angular size were carried out with a relatively small chip on the 1 m telescope at siding spring ; sky subtraction may have been less effective than for the larger objects observed with that system .",
    "we apply a correction to the mfb magnitude scale as follows :    @xmath93    for objects of @xmath94 , where @xmath95 , and @xmath96 for @xmath97 .    the overlap of objects between our and the hm samples ( 51 ) and that between the hm and mfb samples ( 86 ) are too small to yield a statistically significant offset between scales .",
    "we thus use the raw hm magnitudes unchanged .",
    "the scatter in the comparisons gives an idea of the reliability of i band magnitudes . while comparisons of repeat observations within a given data set report consistency to within 0.04 mag , comparison between different data sets suggests that the quality of the data may be slightly worse , on the order of 0.060.07 mag .",
    "large discrepancies , in excess of 0.15 mag , occur more frequently than would be expected if errors were random ; these cases probably arise from the occasional misjudgement of photometric conditions , or from misidentification of the source . in the tabulation of data utilized for this study , we footnote large discrepancies between different data sources .",
    "when several sources are available , we generally adopt average values , else we justify our choice in the notes to table 2 .",
    "adopted raw magnitudes are corrected first for extinction within our galaxy , by adopting the burstein and heiles ( 1978 ) tabulation of b  band extinctions , converted to i ",
    "band by means of @xmath98 , and by a cosmological k ",
    "term , adopted from han ( 1992 ) : @xmath99 .",
    "the internal extinction in each galaxy s disk is treated in the manner described in paper ii .",
    "all magnitudes are converted to a face  on perspective , by applying an additive term which depends on both the inclination of the system to the line of sight and on its intrinsic luminosity .",
    "the corrected apparent magnitude is then    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the raw asymptotic magnitude and @xmath102 the internal extinction correction .",
    "@xmath103 are positive quantities .",
    "the internal extinction correction was parametrized in paper ii as    @xmath104    where @xmath49 is the corrected ellipticity and the parameter @xmath105 depends on absolute luminosity of the galaxy as shown in figure 7c of paper ii ( @xmath106 for @xmath107 , @xmath108 for @xmath109 , and @xmath105 changes linearly by -0.4 mag@xmath11 elsewhere ) .    for application in a tf program , however , it is convenient to have the value of @xmath105 parametrized as a function of velocity width . in figure 15",
    ", we plot the magnitude residuals with respect to a direct fit to the template tf relation of the cluster sample , which we will obtain in paper vii .",
    "the data plotted pertain to the all sky spiral sample described in papers i and ii ( filled circles ) and the cluster sample ( unfilled squares ) .",
    "the magnitude residuals are computed after correcting the magnitudes by imposing @xmath110 in eqn . ( 11 ) , and separately for five different ranges of velocity widths ; since residuals are plotted versus @xmath111 , their trends mimic the internal extinction correction that should be applicable .",
    "the solid lines inset on panels ( c ) through ( e ) are not fits to the data points but rather the mean internal extinction laws that would apply to the subset of galaxies , according to the model of eqn .",
    "( 12 ) derived for late  type spirals ( the slope of the line is the value of @xmath105 which would be used , according to the precepts of paper ii , averaged over all the galaxies in the subset ) . we adopt those lines as our internal extinction laws . for the fastest rotators",
    "the internal extinction appears to increase slowly for values of @xmath111 smaller than about 0.5 , then more steeply at higher inclinations .",
    "the apparent bilinearity of the internal extinction law may be related to a decrease of scale height to scale length ratio with overall galaxy size , or to a decreasing degree of clumpiness of opaque regions in the disk with increasing disk size : both effects would shift the inclinations at which internal extinction increases more steeply to values closer to edge  on . the departure of the data from the simple model of eqn .",
    "( 12 ) is significant enough , especially for objects of intermediate inclination in panel ( a ) of figure 15 , that the adoption of an alternative model is warranted . in order to keep it simple , for the fastest rotators we adopt a bilinear model , which involves two different values of @xmath105 , respectively for high and low values of @xmath111 .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath105 , tabulated for different values of velocity width , are given in table 3 ; for the two bins of higher width , two values of @xmath105 are given , meant to apply respectively below and above the value @xmath112 .",
    "table 3 is used in the estimate of the internal extinction correction that leads to the values listed in col ( 14 ) of table 2 . finally , for objects with @xmath113 , an additional 0.05 mag internal extinction term is adopted .",
    "higher extinction occurring in edge  on systems is to be expected from extinction models , and visually dramatized by the effect of dust lanes bisecting disks ; it is also statistically suggestive in our data , which includes 31 objects listed at @xmath113 .",
    "a correction of only 0.05 mag over the inclination dependent law may be conservative , but it is likely that a significant fraction of the systems deemed to be at @xmath113 are not exactly edge  on ( the determined value of @xmath24 being highly sensitivity on the assumed value of @xmath51 , see eqn 2 ) , and additional 0.05 mag of extinction is a fair statistical correction which averages over such systems .",
    "the cluster sample contains a sizable fraction of galaxies of type earlier than sbc , for which all our extinction relations had been obtained . on the grounds of suggestive statistical evidence , based on the comparison of about 30 galaxies earlier than sab and about 160 galaxies of type sb with the galaxies of later types , we adopt for all galaxies of type earlier than sbc",
    "an extinction relation which , at any given inclination , is 85% of that estimated for the sbc and sc galaxies as shown in figure 15 and table 3 .",
    "this `` differential treatment '' , which is typically smaller than the total error on the magnitude , as discussed below , has a negligible impact on the final template obtained in paper vii . while it needs to be corroborated by the study of larger samples , the sense of the correction appears clear , and it points in the direction of an increasing ratio between scale heights of the dust and of the stellar population sampled by the i band , towards later types .",
    "estimates of the accuracy of our tabulated magnitudes derive from the addition in quadrature of two main quantities .",
    "one is the measurement error , resulting from estimates of the photometric conditions at the time of data taking , the quality of the sky subtraction , the effects of neighboring interfering objects in the frame , the quality of the asymptotic extrapolation of the light profile , etc . in general , these sources of errors are not itemized in the literature . whenever an estimate of this error is not given in the sources",
    "used other than our own , we assume a value of 0.04 mag . if more than one independent measurement of the magnitude is available for a given object , we adopt as a measurement error either 0.04 mag or one half of the magnitude difference between extreme values , whichever is largest .",
    "the second source of error derives from the corrections expressed by eqn .",
    "( 11 ) , of which @xmath102 is usually the most important .",
    "we adopt an uncertainty of 15% on the value of @xmath105 and propagate the error , together with that on the uncertainty on the axial ratio , to that on the estimate of the extinction correction .",
    "this component of the uncertainty typically exceeds the measurement error , for inclinations larger than about 60@xmath20 . in paper vii",
    ", we shall refer to the combination in quadrature of measurement and processing errors described above as the `` total measurement error '' on the magnitude .",
    "here we investigate the global properties of the cluster galaxies listed in table 2 . as discussed in section 3 , for each cluster",
    ", two principal subsamples have been defined : one of objects believed to be cluster members ( * in * ) and a second ( * in+ * ) that , in addition to cluster members , also includes objects in the periphery and near the systemic velocity of the cluster , but sufficiently removed ( extending to about 3 or 4 abell radii ) that a membership assignment can not be confidently made .    the distribution of apparent i band magnitudes of all galaxies in the * in+ * samples is shown in figure 16 .",
    "it illustrates that for this sample no assumption of completeness to any useful flux limit can be made .",
    "similarly , figure 17 displays the distribution of isophotal radii of the same galaxies , as measured at @xmath114 mag arcsec@xmath35 , demonstrating a similar unsuitability of the data to be usefully analyzed with criteria applicable to angular size limited samples .",
    "many haphazard circumstances affect the construction of a cluster tf sample , which eventually lead to distributions such as those in figures 16 and 17 : inaccuracy of parameters listed in catalogs from which samples are extracted , a priori availability of redshifts , telescope scheduling , weather conditions , a posteriori sifting by final data quality , availability of data from external sources based on different selection criteria , etc .",
    "the analysis of the data requires that corrections be applied , that take into consideration the peculiarities of the sample selection .",
    "unfortunately , individual cluster samples are still small enough that sacrifice of a fraction of available objects made to obtain a clean subset of simple completeness characteristics , and to which straightforward corrections can be applied , is painfully impractical . in order to maintain sample integrity and overcome the effects of selection biases",
    ", we believe the best current approach is that of estimating corrections via computer simulations with artificial samples that reproduce the completeness characteristics of the data .",
    "an analysis of the completeness characteristics of a larger sample of spirals , which includes the current cluster sample as a subset , is presented in papers i and ii . in paper ii , we used visibility functions of luminosity and central disk surface brightness to illustrate built  in biases in the optical catalogs from which the observed objects were extracted .    in figure 18 , we show the distribution of absolute magnitudes of all the galaxies included in the * in+ * cluster samples .",
    "the line superimposed onto the histogram represents our best estimate of the spiral galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) from which the observed sample may be assumed to have been extracted .",
    "the latter is parametrized by a schechter formula with @xmath115 and @xmath116 , obtained by a match between the observed distribution in each cluster with the luminosity functions of spiral galaxies derived by sandage , binggeli and tammann ( 1984 ) in their survey of the virgo cluster .",
    "the skewness of the adopted lf departs from the nearly gaussian luminosity function of normal spirals found in the las campanas survey of sandage ( 1984 ) .",
    "this is due to a small contribution of sdm systems which contaminates the `` normal '' spiral sample .",
    "objects fainter than @xmath117 are only observed in the nearby clusters / groups , such as fornax , eridanus , ursa major and mdl59 . for comparison",
    ", the milky way galaxy has an approximate i band absolute magnitude of -22 , m31 of -22.5 and m33 of -19.7 ( pierce and tully 1992 ) . the average color ( b - i ) of spirals such as those in our sample is about 1.5 mag",
    ". the shape of the lf from which cluster samples are extracted is important in the computation of incompleteness bias corrections . in paper vii",
    "we carry out those computations for two values of @xmath118 , including the one quoted above , in order to ascertain the sensitivity of the correction on the characteristics of the adopted lf .",
    "cluster membership was assigned according to criteria that varied somewhat from cluster to cluster , depending on how well the cluster parameters are known . in clusters for which a large body of redshift information is available , and for which reliable estimates of the velocity dispersion and caustic curves are known ,",
    "membership assignment has been extended with some confidence to larger distances from the cluster center . on the other hand , for less well defined clusters ,",
    "a more conservative approach has been adopted : membership was restricted to objects projected more closely to the cluster center and/or with velocities closer to its systemic velocity .    in some cases",
    ", clusters are located at small angular and velocity separations from nearby aggregates , such as in the case of the ngc 383 and ngc 507 groups , fornax and eridanus , a2197 and a2199 , a2634 and a2666 . in each case ,",
    "assignment to the * in * and * in+ * samples was made according to criteria of angular and velocity separation , similar to those extensively described in the study of the a2634/a2666 system by scodeggio ( 1995 ) . in some cases ,",
    "galaxies in cluster peripheries may with nearly equal likelihood be considered peripheral members of either of two nearby clusters ; we have then avoided entry duplication , assigning each galaxy to only one cluster listing .",

    "there is no ambiguity in the membership assignment to any objects projected inside the circle of 1 @xmath122 radius .",
    "three galaxies projected between the circles of 1 @xmath122 and 2 @xmath122 , ugc 764 , ugc 810 and ugc 820 , are assigned to ngc 507 , although they are nearly equidistant to the center of the ngc 383 group .",
    "a percolation algorithm assigns them to ngc 507 , which appears to be the more conspicuous of the two groups .",
    "an effect of the proximity of the two groups is that the peripheral members listed in the ngc 383 table are preferentially to the west of the cluster center .",
    "a262 is located approximately @xmath123 to the ne of the center of ngc 507 , bounding the group to the east .",

    "an appraisal of the distribution of galaxies in the region does however suggest that this loose aggregate is organized around several high ranked but well separated galaxies .",

    "we notice that in the periphery of the cluster , at @xmath130 , the mean redshift of galaxies with known redshift is perhaps 160 larger than the systemic velocity adopted for cen30 ( as derived by lucey ) . given the difficulty in separating cen30 and cen45",
