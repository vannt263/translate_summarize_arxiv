    "the formation mechanism of massive stars is essentially unknown .",
    "this is mostly due to observational difficulties in finding and establishing an evolutionary sequence for young stellar objects ( ysos ) .",
    "it is believed that during the accretion phase , ysos remain heavily enshrouded in dusty cocoons , behind hundreds of magnitudes of extinction at visual wavelengths ( even at near - infrared wavelengths for the earliest phases ) .",
    "a very interesting group of ysos has been identified in the galactic giant hii regions ( ghii ) m17 ( hanson , horwarth & conti 1997 ) , w43 ( blum , damineli & conti 1999 ) , w42 ( blum , conti & damineli 2000 ) , w31 ( blum , damineli & conti 2001 ) and ngc 3576 ( figueredo et al .",
    "these are luminous ysos with excess emission in the k band and have color indexes h - k@xmath12 .",
    "j , h and k spectra of these objects typically show a featureless continuum . in some cases",
    "the co 2.3 @xmath0 m bandhead is seen in emission or absorption , and in others feii and/or h@xmath2 are seen in emission .    figueredo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) identified two massive yso candidates in the position of irs 1 in ngc 3576 .",
    "this source was discovered by lacy , beck & geballe ( 1982 ) and it was recently observed at 10 @xmath0 m by walsh et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , but none of their images have enough spatial resolution to resolve the source .",
    "observations were obtained at the gemini south observatory 8-m telescope on december 4th , 2001 .",
    "oscir is based on a rockwell 128@xmath3128 pixel si : as bib detector , with a 0.089 arcsec / pixel plate scale at gemini .",
    "the total field of view of the camera is 11@xmath311 arcsec and the spatial resolution ( fwhm of the psf star ) is @xmath40.5 arcsec .",
    "the images were taken through the wide n - band filter ( 10.8@xmath0 m ) and ihw18 ( 18.2 @xmath0 m ) and the 7.9 , 9.8 and 12.5 @xmath0 m narrow filters .",
    "flux calibration was performed by taking the flux densities of the mid - infrared standard star @xmath5 cma observed during the night as part of the baseline calibration program .",
    "the uncertainty of these procedures is estimated to be @xmath410% , which is good enough for our purposes .",
    "all images presented have on - source exposure time of 46 seconds , except the n - band image which has 40 seconds .",
    "background and sky subtraction was done via the standard chop and nod technique .",
    "the field of ngc 3576 irs 1 is shown in the figure [ n18 ] , for the n and ihw18 bands .",
    "irs 1 has been resolved into 3 sources embedded in extended emission .",
    "all images were smoothed by convolving each image by the corresponding normalized psf star fitted from the standard star using a fourier transform .",
    "figure [ sed ] shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each source .",
    "the jhk fluxes are from figueredo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the l - band flux is from moneti ( 1992 ) .",
    "the nir - to - mir seds are very similar to the results found for a group of less massive aebe stars by hillenbrand et al .",
    "the stars of this group ( called _ group ii _ ) have seds with infrared excess and are supposed to be young stars with intermediate masses ( m@xmath6 10 m@xmath7 , average spectral type a5 ) still accreting .",
    "the infrared excess is attributed to a dense dusty accretion disk surrounding the young stars .",
    "figure [ maps ] shows the spatial distribution of the dust , as well as , its color temperature map .",
    "the map at the left was obtained dividing the calibrated image taken at 9.8 @xmath0 m by the 7.9 @xmath0 m image . from this map",
    ", we have calculated the optical depth of the silicate absorption feature and we found @xmath8=3.7 .",
    "the right panel is the dust color temperature map which was calculated from the ratio of the 7.9/18 @xmath0 m images . from this map",
    "we can see the dust temperature associated with each source : t@xmath4280k ( # 50 ) , t@xmath4210k ( # 48 ) and t@xmath9160k ( # 60 ) .",
    "we presented high - resolution mid - infrared images of ngc 3576 irs 1 , that has been resolved into 3 sources for the first time at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the seds of each source were constructed from 1.25 to 18 @xmath0 m with data taken from literature .",
    "each sed shows increasing fluxes toward to longer wavelengths .",
    "hillenbrand et al . ( 1992 ) found similar seds for a group of less massive young stars in process of accreting mass via an accretion disk embedded in a dusty cocoon .",
    "this similarity suggests the same interpretation for our results .",
    "finally we presented maps of dust distribution , temperature and optical depth as well .",
