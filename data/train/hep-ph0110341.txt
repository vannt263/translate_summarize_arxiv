    "the unification of b and @xmath10 yukawa couplings , along with gauge coupling unification , is traditionally been viewed as a success of supersymmetric grand unification models with grand unification group structure su(5 ) and so(10 ) . however",
    ", a close scrutiny reveals that @xmath0 unification is rather sensitively dependent on the parameter space of the supersymmetric models such as @xmath11 and @xmath12@xcite , gut threshold corrections and the effects of gravitational smearing@xcite .",
    "it is also known that @xmath0 unification is sensitive to the sign of the higgs mixing parameter @xmath3@xcite and that it prefers the negative sign of @xmath3 in the standard @xmath3 convention@xcite .",
    "however , the recent experimental results from brookhaven@xcite indicate that for a class of susy models the sign of @xmath3 is positive@xcite and this result then makes the realization of @xmath0 unification more difficult . some recent analyses have tried to address this problem . in the analysis of ref.@xcite",
    ", the authors work in an so(10 ) supersymmetric grand unified model and show that with the inclusion of the d - term contribution to the sfermion and higgs masses arising from the breakdown of so(10 ) it is possible to obtain yukawa coupling unification up to about 30% with a positive value of @xmath3 . the sparticle spectrum found in this analysis is close to that of an inverted hierarchy model@xcite . in this scenario",
    "the first and the second generation sparticles masses are typically above a tev and @xmath13 ( a=(g-2)/2 ) is on the extreme low side of the corridor allowed by the bnl experiment .",
    "another analysis within so(10 ) is of ref.@xcite which requires an almost exact yukawa coupling unification for positive @xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath13 predicted in this work is also rather small , i.e. , in the range @xmath14 .",
    "the scenarios of both refs.@xcite require @xmath15 unification and are for large @xmath12 , i.e. , typically @xmath16 .    in this paper we carry out an analysis with focus on @xmath0 yukawa unification within su(5 ) .",
    "we do a comprehensive study of this problem with inclusion of nonuniversalities .",
    "we find new regions of the parameter space where one has @xmath0 unification with satisfaction of the @xmath1 and the @xmath2 constraints .",
    "while most of the new parameter space where the desired constraints are satisfied requires @xmath4 , we also find regions of the parameter space satisfying all the constraints for the @xmath6 case .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we discuss briefly the current situation on @xmath17 . in sec.iii",
    "we discuss the framework of the proposed analysis . in sec.iv",
    "we give a discussion of the results .",
    "conclusions are given in sec.v .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the current situation on @xmath13 . the recent brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl )",
    "experiment gives@xcite @xmath18 while the prediction in the standard model where @xmath19 is@xcite @xmath20 essentially the entire error above arises from the hadronic correction since@xcite @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "there is thus a @xmath26 deviation between theory and experiment ,    @xmath27    the result above is to be compared with the electro - weak correction in the standard model@xcite @xmath28 .",
    "the observed difference between experiment and theory could arise due to a variety of phenomena@xcite .",
    "of special interest to us here is the possibility that the observed phenomenon is supersymmetry .",
    "it is well known that susy makes important contributions to @xmath1@xcite . after the result of the bnl experiment became available analyses within susy",
    "were carried out for a variety of scenarios .",
    "we begin by summarizing here the results for msugra@xcite which is characterized by the following parameters : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath12 and @xmath32 where @xmath29 is the universal scalar mass , @xmath30 is the universal gaugino mass , @xmath31 is the universal trilinear coupling , @xmath33 where @xmath34 gives mass to the up quark and @xmath35 gives mass to the down quark and the lepton of each generation and @xmath3 is the higgs mixing parameter . in this case one",
    "finds that the sparticle spectrum consistent with the observed effect satisfies the constraint so that @xmath36 tev and @xmath37 tev and further that the sign of @xmath3 is determined to be positive@xcite .",
    "now positive @xmath3 is preferred by the @xmath38 constraint since for positive @xmath3 , the parameter space consistent with the constraint is large , while for negative @xmath3 the parameter space consistent with the constraint is small@xcite .",
    "a positive @xmath3 is also desirable for the direct detection of dark matter@xcite . within msugra the sparticle spectrum consistent with the bnl constraint",
    "lies with in reach of the large hadron collider@xcite .",
    "however , the upper limits are significantly model dependent@xcite .",
    "further , there is also a significant dependence on the cp violating phases@xcite .",
    "such model dependence should be taken account of while interpreting the implications of the bnl result .",
    "the main purpose of this paper concerns the investigation of the parameter space where @xmath0 unification occurs consistent with the bnl @xmath17 constraint and the @xmath2 constraint by relaxing the universal boundary conditions in msugra .",
    "the universality of the soft parameters in msugra model arises from the assumption of a flat kahler potential and the assumption that the gauge kinetic energy function @xmath39 is proportional to @xmath40 where @xmath41 for su(5 ) .",
    "however , the nature of planck scale physics is still largely unknown .",
    "thus it is reasonable to investigate more general scenarios based on curved kahler potentials and with non gauge singlet gauge kinetic energy functions . of course",
    ", there exist strong constraints on the allowed form of nonuniversalities from flavor changing neutral currents . in the scalar sector",
    "the flavor changing neutral current constraints still allow for the presence of significant amounts of nonuniversalities in the higgs doublet sector and in the third generation sector@xcite .",
    "our focus in this paper is on nonuniversalities in the gaugino mass sector . in this sector supergravity theories in general",
    "allow for the presence of an arbitrary gauge kinetic energy function @xmath39 . in the presence of a curved kahler potential",
    "this then leads to a gaugino mass matrix of the form @xmath42= @xmath43@xmath44@xmath45@xmath46@xmath47@xmath48 , where @xmath49- \\kappa^2 k$ ] . here",
    ", @xmath50 is the superpotential , @xmath51 is the kahler potential , @xmath52 are the complex scalar fields , and @xmath53 gev@xmath54 where @xmath55 is newton s constant .",
    "now @xmath39 would have a nontrivial field dependence in general involving fields which transform as a singlet or a nonsinglet irreducible representation of the underlying gauge group .",
    "with imposition of the @xmath56 gauge invariance the gaugino masses at the gut scale @xmath57 will in general have the form@xcite    m_i(0)=m__r c_r n_i^r where @xmath58 are characteristic of the representation r and @xmath59 are the relative weights of the various representations . since @xmath39 transform as @xmath60 the representations r consist of the set @xmath61 .",
    "the singlet representation leads to universality of the gaugino masses while the nonsinglet representations @xmath62 and @xmath63 generate nonuniversalities ( @xmath58 for various representations are given in the appendix ) .",
    "we will investigate @xmath0 unification by exploring a wide range of the soft susy parameter space with inclusion of nonuniversalities of the type that enter in eq.(4 ) .",
    "the details of the analysis are as follows : we begin at the gut scale with a prescribed set of boundary conditions and carry out a two loop renormalization group evolution ( rge ) for the couplings as well as for the soft parameters .",
    "the electroweak symmetry is broken radiatively by the minimization of the higgs potential computed to the complete one - loop level  @xcite at the scale@xcite @xmath64 . in the analysis",
    "we include the supersymmetric corrections  @xcite to the top quark ( with @xmath65 gev ) and the bottom quark mass .",
    "for the light higgs boson mass we have used the code _",
    "feynhiggsfast _  @xcite .    in the analysis we impose the bnl @xmath5 constraint and the @xmath2 constraint which we now summarize . in the standard model",
    "the branching ratio for the process @xmath2 is estimated to be@xcite @xmath66@xmath23 @xmath67@xmath68 .",
    "the most recent experimental determination of this branching ratio gives@xcite @xmath66@xmath23@xmath69 @xmath68 where the first error is statistical , and there are two types of systematic errors .",
    "the experimental determination of @xmath66 has many inherent errors and so we use a @xmath70 range around the current experiment@xcite and thus take    210 ^ -4<b(bs+)<4.3 10 ^ -4 the issue of @xmath0 unification is closely tied with the supersymmetric correction to the b quark mass    m_b(m_z)=_b(m_z)(1+_b ) where @xmath71 is loop correction to @xmath72 .",
    "the running b quark mass @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the pole mass , is computed via the rg running from @xmath75 to @xmath74 using 2-loop standard model renormalization group equations .",
    "the pole mass @xmath74 is then related to the running mass @xmath73 by the relation@xcite m_b=(1++12.4 ) m_b(m_b ) now the largest contributions to @xmath71 arise from the gluino and the chargino pieces@xcite . for the gluino one",
    "b^g= i(m_b_1 ^ 2 , m_b_2 ^ 2,m_g^2 ) where i(a , b , c ) = we note that since @xmath76 is always positive one finds that @xmath77 is negative when @xmath78 is negative .",
    "this situation can arise when either @xmath3 is negative and @xmath79 positive or when @xmath3 is positive and @xmath79 is negative .",
    "there is a similar situation for the case of the chargino contribution which is _",
    "b^^+= i(m_t_1 ^ 2 , m_t_2 ^ 2,^2 ) where @xmath80 . in this case",
    "@xmath81 is negative when either @xmath3 is negative and @xmath82 is positive or when @xmath3 is positive and @xmath82 is negative .",
    "we note that typically satisfaction of the @xmath5 constraint requires that the sign of @xmath83 be positive .",
    "for universal boundary conditions this would lead to a positive @xmath77 which is not preferred by @xmath0 unification .",
    "we note , however , that for the case when the gaugino masses arise from a 24 plet term in eq.(4 ) one has that the signs of the @xmath84 and @xmath85 are necessarily opposite . because of this one finds that a positive @xmath86 implies a negative @xmath77 which is what is preferred by @xmath0 unification .",
    "this anti - correlation between the positivity of @xmath86 and the negativity of @xmath77 occurs _ independent of the sign of @xmath3_. however , since the satisfaction of @xmath2 typically prefers a positive @xmath3 the positive @xmath3 sign would still be preferred but solutions with negative @xmath3 are not necessarily excluded just because of the bnl constraint in this case .",
    "( the fact that a negative @xmath3 can still give a positive supersymmetric contribution to @xmath1 in the 24 plet case was also noticed in ref.@xcite ) . typically one expects the gluino contribution of eq.(8 ) to be the largest supersymmetric contribution .",
    "an enhancement of @xmath71 can occur when both @xmath77 and @xmath81 are negative . for @xmath4",
    "this occurs when @xmath87 and @xmath88 and for @xmath6 this occurs when @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we give now details of the numerical analysis with focus on the gaugino mass nonuniversalities as discussed above .",
    "we find that the most favorable situation arises for the case when @xmath91 is negative while cases with nonvanishing @xmath92 and @xmath93 do not produce @xmath0 unification consistent with @xmath5 and @xmath2 constraints .",
    "it is indeed the @xmath5 constraint which is not satisfied in the latter two scenarios .",
    "the result of the analysis is given in figs.1 -10 which we now discuss in detail . in analyzing @xmath0 unification",
    "it is useful to define the parameter @xmath94 which prescribes the accuracy with which @xmath0 unification is achieved where    @xmath95    in fig.(1a ) we plot @xmath94 vs @xmath12 for the following range of parameters : @xmath96 gev , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath4 .",
    "the dotted points satisfy @xmath0 unification at the level shown , the crosses additionally satisfy @xmath2 constraint and the filled circles satisfy all the constraints , ie . , @xmath0 unification , @xmath2 and @xmath1 constraints .",
    "if one uses a criterion that @xmath0 unification be satisfied to an accuracy of 30% then fig.(1a ) exhibits that there are significant regions of the parameter space with @xmath99 .",
    "however , fig.(1a ) also shows that there are appreciable regions in the parameter space where @xmath0 unification can be satisfied to 20% , 10% and even less than 5% level .",
    "an interesting phenomenon we see in fig.(1a ) is that the values of @xmath12 consistent with @xmath0 unification lie in a wide range depending on the accuracy of the @xmath0 unification that is desired .",
    "thus for a @xmath99 one finds that the allowed values of @xmath12 can be as low as @xmath100 and as high as @xmath101 .",
    "however , a @xmath0 unification with a few percent accuracy would require a value of @xmath12 in the vicinity of 30 or above .",
    "an analysis similar to that of fig.(1a ) but with a plot of @xmath94 vs @xmath29 is given in fig.(1b ) where the parameter range is as in fig.(1a ) and @xmath12 lies in the range @xmath102 .",
    "we note that the bulk of @xmath29 values satisfying all the desired constraints are such that @xmath103tev .",
    "an analysis of @xmath94 vs @xmath104 is given in fig.(1c ) .",
    "here one finds quite remarkably that the allowed points in the parameter space which satisfy the desired constraints all appear to lie in a rather narrow strip @xmath105 , where the narrow strip specifically comes from the @xmath5 constraint .",
    "finally in fig.(1d ) a plot of @xmath94 vs @xmath31 reveals that the bulk of the allowed @xmath31 values consistent with all the desired constraints are negative . in most of the parameter space",
    "the dominant supersymmetric correction to the b quark mass arises from the gluino exchange term .",
    "these results are consistent with our discussion at the end of sec.3 .    the importance of supersymmetry for @xmath0 unification is exhibited in fig.(2 ) which gives a plot of @xmath94 vs @xmath71 where @xmath71 is the supersymmetric contribution to the b quark mass . here",
    "the dots refer to the points satisfying @xmath0 unification , and filled squares represent points which additionally satisfy the @xmath2 and the @xmath1 constraints . from fig.(2 ) one finds that the more accurate the @xmath0 unification the larger is the fraction of the supersymmetric contribution and that @xmath0 unification within a few percent accuracy requires a susy correction to the b quark mass which can be as large as 30% to 40% .",
    "next we discuss @xmath0 unification with the stricter constraint that the unification hold to within 10% . in fig.(3a )",
    "a plot of @xmath71 is given as a function of @xmath12 with all other parameters the same as in fig.(2 ) but with the additional constraint that @xmath106 .",
    "here one finds that the susy corrections must be at least 15 - 20% of the b quark mass but could be as large as 40% .",
    "a similar analysis but with @xmath71 vs @xmath29 is given in fig.(3b ) , with @xmath71 vs @xmath107 in fig.(3c ) , and with @xmath71 vs @xmath31 in fig.(3d ) .",
    "we note that for the case of fig.(3d ) the allowed values of @xmath31 are all negative as anticipated in our discussion at the end of sec.3 for the @xmath4 case .    motivated by the fact that @xmath108 is the most favored zone for @xmath0 unification ( see fig .  [ perc_params_a ] )",
    "we compare the sparticle mass spectra in msugra with the one arising in the 24-plet nonuniversal case in figs.[unification_spectra_a ] and [ unification_spectra_b ] .",
    "since the @xmath109 gauge sector produces important renormalization group effects on the sparticle masses we have chosen identical @xmath110 values in figs.[unification_spectra_a ] and [ unification_spectra_b ] for a direct comparison .",
    "thus for @xmath29 and @xmath110 fixed we find that the squark and slepton masses undergo a relatively small change as we go from fig.(4a ) to fig.(4b ) but a relatively large change is seen in the lightest neutralino mass due to the very different ratio of the @xmath111 and @xmath109 gaugino masses for the 24 plet case compared to the msugra case . having identified the signature of the 24-plet nonuniversal scenario on the mass spectra as given by figs.(4a ) and ( 4b ) we now study the sparticle spectrum in the most favored @xmath0 unification region under the @xmath112 constraint and the @xmath5 limits .",
    "the result is exhibited in fig.[unification_spectra_c ] .",
    "the choice of parameters in fig.(4c ) is based on the fact that the requirement of @xmath0 unification along with the @xmath112 constraint prefers the parameters @xmath113 , @xmath114  tev and @xmath115 .",
    "the choice @xmath116  gev ( see fig.[perc_params_a ] ) is guided by the fact that the @xmath5 constraint is most easily satisfied for this value of @xmath117 . in fig.(4c ) @xmath94 ranges between @xmath118 to @xmath119 .",
    "regarding the sparticle spectra we note that as in fig.(4b ) the lightest neutralino mass is much smaller relative to the msugra case of fig.(4a ) .",
    "another interesting phenomenon is that because of the large @xmath31 value in this case there is a large l - r mixing in the stop mixing matrix resulting in significantly smaller @xmath120 here relative to that in fig.(4b ) .",
    "more generally the third generation scalar sector is relatively lighter . finally , most importantly , while considering @xmath29 between 400 to 800 gev which is the favored region for satisfying all the constraints ( see fig.[perc_params_b ] ) we see that the spectrum in fig.[unification_spectra_c ] is well below a tev .",
    "thus the naturalness requirement is preserved ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we discuss now briefly the 24 plet case for @xmath6 .",
    "the results are exhibited in fig.(5 ) where we have used the range of parameters @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 and imposed the unification criterion @xmath124 .",
    "the analysis of fig.(5 ) shows that there are significant regions of the parameter space where all the constraint , i.e. , @xmath2 , @xmath1 and the @xmath0 unification are consistently satisfied . in fig.(6 )",
    "we exhibit the allowed and the disallowed regions due to various constraints in the @xmath125 plane .",
    "dotted points satisfy @xmath0 constraint with @xmath126 , the blue crosses are the points which are additionally allowed by the @xmath1 constraint and the black filled circles satisfy the @xmath1 constraint , the @xmath2 constraint , and the constraint @xmath126 .",
    "fig.(6a ) gives the analysis for @xmath4 and fig.(6b ) for @xmath6 .",
    "we note that the density of points where all the constraints are satisfied is quite significant for both the @xmath4 and the @xmath6 cases .",
    "next we discuss cases where the gaugino masses transform like the 75 and the 200 plet representations .",
    "we start by exhibiting in fig.(7 ) the gaugino masses at the scale @xmath75 for the universal ( msugra ) case ( fig.(7a ) ) and for the nonuniversal ( 24,75 and 100 plet ) cases ( figs.(7b-7d ) ) .",
    "we note that the ratio of gaugino masses for the 75 plet and the 200 plet cases are drastically different from each other and from the msugra and the 24 plet cases .",
    "this is of course what we expect from the nature of the boundary conditions for the four cases as given in the appendix . in fig.(8 ) we exhibit the mass spectra for the universal and the nonuniversal cases as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "one notices the drastic modification of the pattern of sparticle masses as one goes from the universal case of fig.(8a ) to the nonuniversal cases of figs.(8b-8d ) . a similar display with respect to @xmath30 for the universal case and with respect to @xmath110 for the nonuniversal cases",
    "is given in fig.(9 ) where the gray areas represent the excluded regions because of lep chargino mass limits@xcite and the absence of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "again one finds some drastic modifications of the sparticle spectrum when one compares the four cases exhibited in fig.(9 ) . in fig.(10 ) we exhibit the points in the parameter space which satisfy @xmath0 unification for 75 and 200 plet cases .",
    "one finds that there exist significant regions of the parameter space in fig.(10a ) and fig.(10c ) satisfying @xmath0 unification which also additionally satisfy the @xmath2 constraint for @xmath4 .",
    "both the requirements of @xmath0 unification as well as the @xmath2 constraint reduces the allowed parameter space significantly for @xmath6 , but there still exist significant regions of the parameter space in this case which are allowed by the constraints as shown in fig.(10b ) and fig.(10d ) . however , none of the allowed points in figs.(10a-10d ) which satisfy the @xmath0 unification and the @xmath2 constraints satisfy the @xmath1 constraint .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed @xmath0 unification within su(5 ) with emphasis on nonuniversalities in the gaugino sector .",
    "we find that there exist regions of the parameter space with nonuniversalities in the gaugino mass sector which lead to @xmath0 unification consistent with the brookhaven result on @xmath1 and with satisfaction of the @xmath127 constraint .",
    "we discussed the 24 plet , the 75 plet and the 200 plet types of nonuniversality in the gaugino sector .",
    "we found that while @xmath0 unification and the @xmath2 constraint can be satisfied for all three types of nonuniversalities , but it is only the 24 plet case where the additional bnl @xmath5 constraint can be satisfied .",
    "an important result that was observed for the 24 plet case is that in this case there exists an anti - correlation between the positivity of @xmath128 and the negativity of @xmath77 and hence of @xmath71 since @xmath77 is the dominant contribution to @xmath71 over most of the parameter space of the model .",
    "quite remarkably the above anti - correlation holds irrespective of the sign of @xmath3 .",
    "the above result implies that in the 24 plet case the experimental bnl constraint that @xmath129 automatically leads to a negative contribution from @xmath77 resulting in a negative @xmath71 which is what is needed for @xmath0 unification .",
    "we investigated both the @xmath4 and the @xmath6 branches and find satisfactory solutions for both cases . in both cases",
    "we find new regions of the parameter space which give negative susy contribution to the b quark mass , satisfy the @xmath5 as well as @xmath2 constraints and lead to a satisfactory @xmath0 unification .",
    "the new regions of the parameter space are also consistent with the naturalness criteria and further the corresponding sparticle spectrum which arises in this parameter space lies within the reach of the large hadron collider",
    ". it would be interesting to discuss the details of the supersymmetric signals such as the trileptonic signal@xcite in this part of the parameter space . however , this analysis is outside the scope of this paper .",
    "further , we have not discussed in this paper the topic of proton stability which involves the higgs triplet sector of the theory .",
