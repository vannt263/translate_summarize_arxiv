    "matter coupling regime can be realized in two ways : by combining the matter with a high - q microcavity or by exposing the matter to a ultrashort intense pump pulse .    to describe the strong coupling between an arbitrary two  level system and quantum light , the jaynes  cummings ( jc ) model is conventionally used @xcite .",
    "one of the most fundamental phenomenon predicted within the jc model is the oscillation of the population between levels with the rabi frequency ( rabi oscillations ) .",

    "for the experimental observation in a double quantum dot ( qd ) system . as a whole , the observation and intensive studying of excitonic rabi oscillations @xcite motivates the extension of the jc  model to incorporate specific interactions inherent to confined exciton in a host .    in the given paper we present a microscopic theory of the interaction of an isolated qd with quantum light for both weak and strong coupling regimes .",
    "we incorporate the local field correction into the jc model as an additional physical mechanism influencing the rabi effect in a qd exposed to quantum light .",
    "in particular , the rabi oscillations are shown to exist even in the limit of a weak incident field .    in the weak coupling regime ,",
    "the local  field effects in optical properties of qds have been theoretically investigated in refs . for classical exposing light and in ref . for quantum light . in the latter case",
    "it has been shown that for a qd interacting with fock qubits the local fields induce a fine structure of the absorption ( emission ) spectrum : instead of a single line with the frequency corresponding to the exciton transition , a doublet appears with one component shifted to the blue ( red ) .",
    "the intensities of components are completely determined by the quantum light statistics . in the limiting cases of classical light and fock",
    "states the doublet is reduced to a singlet shifted in the former case and unshifted in the latter one .",
    "the role of local fields in the excitonic rabi oscillations in an isolated qd driven by classical excitation was investigated in ref . .",
    "two different oscillatory regimes separated by the bifurcation have been predicted to exist .",

    "there exist several different physical interpretations of local field in qds and , correspondingly , different ways of its theoretical description . the first model ( scheme a in the terminology of ref . ) exploits the standard electrodynamical picture : by virtue of external field screening by charges induced on the qd surface ( the quasistatic coulomb electron ",

    "the the depolarization induced local field is predicted to entail in a qd exposed to an arbitrary photonic state a fine structure of the effective scattering cross  section . instead of a single line of the frequency @xmath121 , a duplet is appeared with one component shifted by a value @xmath169 .",
    "the shifted component is due to electron ",
    "hole correlations , see eq .",
    "( [ sol_eqs_fm ] ) .",
    "the correlations change the qd state and , consequently , provide the inelastic channel of the light scattering .",

    "the scalar coefficient @xmath25 is the qd polarizability of a spherical qd .",

    "the elastic channel is not manifested for pure coherent light ( the glauber state ) .",
    "let us discuss now the local  field induced alteration of the quantum light statistics .",

    "field effect , see fig .",
    "[ fig_fq_pd ] .",
    "therefore , a bigger number of fock states than presented in the initial fock qubit , broaden the frequency spectrum of rabi oscillations , providing thus the chaotic time evolution of the inversion .",
    "it should be noted that the variation in the quantum light statistics occurs even in the weak  field limit @xmath261 . to illustrate that",
    ", consider the observable polarization of the qd exciton defined in the time domain as @xmath262 using eq .",
    "( [ sol_full ] ) we couple the polarization in the frequency domain with the complex  valued amplitude of the mean incident field : @xmath263 then , after some simple manipulations we express the quantum fluctuations of the qd polarization by @xmath264 from eqs .",
    "( [ discussions : pol2 ] ) and ( [ discussions : pol3 ] ) follows that the qd electromagnetic responses to the mean electric field and to its quantum fluctuation are different : the response resonant frequency is shifted by the value @xmath169 in the former case [ relation ( [ discussions : pol2 ] ) ] and remains unshifted in the later one , as given by relation ( [ discussions : pol3 ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the effective polarizability of a qd is an operator in the space of quantum states of light .",
    "it should be pointed out that this property is responsible for the alteration of the photonic state distribution in the weak  field regime and is entirely a local  field effect .",
