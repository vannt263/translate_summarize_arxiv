    "smart mobile devices have promoted the proliferation of mobile crowdsourcing systems ( mcss ) , which facilitates large - scale crowdsouring tasks by exploiting the capacities of ubiquitous mobile users in a collaborative way  @xcite .",
    "typical mcs applications include mobile crowdsensing  @xcite , information searching  @xcite , crowdsourced content caching and sharing  @xcite , and collaborative mobile could computing  @xcite , _ etc .",
    "_ many of these applications require exploiting the collaborative interactions among individual participants in geographical proximity .",
    "for instance , in collaborative searching applications ( _ e.g. _ finding a missing child  @xcite ) , local searching results are required to be shared among surrounding participators .",
    "such geographically proximal interactions can be achieved by using device - to - device ( d2d ) communication ( _ e.g. _ wifi direct and bluetooth ) , which is much more agile and cost - effective compared with using traditional cellular networks , due to its shorter transmission delay , lower power consumption , and ignorable financial cost  @xcite . for instance , in d2d - enabled mobile crowdsensing systems  @xcite , a participating mobile user can report his or her sensory data to the server via other participating phones through opportunistic d2d transmissions rather than through cellular communications directly , which significantly improves the network throughput and reduces the system financial cost .",
    "it has also been shown that d2d communication is promising in cellular traffic offloading in crowdsourced video streaming  @xcite and content sharing in mobile social networking  @xcite .",
    "in addition , d2d communications are considered as the fundamental communication infrastructure in more and more emerging mobile could computing architectures  @xcite .",
    "there exist an increasing number of efforts from both academia and industry to develop d2d related communication techniques , including efficient neighbor discovery  @xcite , secure device pairing  @xcite , d2d enabled cellular networks  @xcite , incentivisation for d2d communications  @xcite , and d2d standards such as wifi direct , bluetooth smart , and lte direct .",
    "however , these approaches can not be directly applied to achieve d2d - enabled mcss , because they can not simultaneously satisfy the following three requirements in practice :    \\1 . * secure d2d connection . * since participating devices are privately held and temporarily recruited , there is no prior trust relation between them . therefore , establishing a shared secret key for the firstly encountered devices ( _ i.e. _ device pairing ) is vital for secure collaborative interactions .",
    "* rapid and user - transparent connection . * due to the opportunistic human contact behaviors , it is highly desired to achieve rapid , autonomous , and user - transparent device pairing processes . however , existing device pairing approaches are based on either physical interactions ( _ e.g. _ button clicks ) between firstly encountered devices or common contextual information gathered gradually  @xcite , and are therefore unsuitable for practical mcss .",
    "* addressing peer diversity . * in a mcs , a participating device could have multiple potential d2d peer devices and need to choose the optimal one ( or a set of optimal ones ) .",
    "this optimization decision should depend on the trustworthiness and other metrics ( _ e.g. _ transmission data rate ) of each candidate . as a result ,",
    "a mechanism estimating the trustworthiness of a certain device as a d2d peer is necessary to guarantee the quality of d2d communications .      in this paper , we present both theoretical and practical studies to simultaneously achieve above three requirements .",
    "our contributions are summarized as follows :    * we develop trustworthy device pairing ( tdp ) , the first device pairing scheme for trustworthy opportunistic d2d communications in mcss .",
    "tdp achieves rapid and user - transparent device paring , which is not supported by the off - the - shelf protocols or state - of - art user - transparent approaches , without introducing extra pairing labors .",
    "in addition , tdp introduces a new trust management method for reliable peer device selections based on online trustworthiness estimation of d2d peers .",
    "* through rigorous security analysis , we demonstrate that tdp is immune to six potential security threats , including _ passive eavesdropping attacks _ , _ impersonating attacks _ , _ man - in - the - middle attacks _ , _ trust forging attacks _ , _ independent negative attacks _ , and _ collusive attacks_. particularly , besides guaranteeing a comparable security intensity to the off - the - shelf protocols , tdp can also resist the _ traffic - oriented attacks _ that are detrimental to d2d communications in mcss . *",
    "we implement tdp in the android operating system and the omnet++ simulator , and conduct real - world experiments and extensive trace - driven simulations to evaluate the performance of tdp .",
    "results demonstrate that tdp significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of pairing speed and stability , and it can effectively eliminate the impact of _ traffic - oriented attacks _ in d2d - enabled mcss .",
    "the next section presents related work .",
    "section [ sec3 ] presents the system model .",
    "the device trust estimation method in d2d - enabled mcss is presented in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "section [ sec5 ] presents the trustworthy device pairing scheme .",
    "real - world experiments and extensive simulations are discussed in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "and we conclude this paper in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "discussions on parameter determinations and security proofs are placed in appendices a and b respectively , which can be found in the supplemental material .",
    "* d2d communications : * there exist a large body of d2d communication based schemes , including efficient neighbor discovery  @xcite , d2d - enabled cellular networks  @xcite , incentivisation for d2d  @xcite , network protocols  @xcite , etc . among those ,",
    "the work  @xcite specifically consider mcss with d2d communications .",
    "however , none of these work considers security issues .",
    "* device pairing : * device pairing focuses on establishing shared keys between freshly encountered devices .",
    "some approaches  @xcite rely on user - interactions to distribute initial trust credentials .",
    "however , in d2d - enabled mcss , mobile users are normally strangers who are unlikely to conduct physical interactions .",
    "since user - transparency is more preferable for spontaneous pairing , the proximity - based approach  @xcite attracts significant attentions , which authenticates adjacent devices leveraging locally sensed contextual information .",
    "however , this approach commonly assumes that adversaries have no sustained access to legal contextual information , which is not acceptable for highly open mcss .",
    "one of the most relevant work is the non - interactive device pairing approach in  @xcite , which , however , requires asynchronous broadcasting of public credentials that may lead to unpredictable pairing time fluctuations . in summary",
    ", none of no existing device pairing approach can achieve both secure and user - transparent d2d connections , as our tdp .",
    "* trust management : * for participatory distributed systems , trust management is an effective approach to enhance system performance by determining the potential gain of self - interested entities according to their trustworthiness  @xcite . in traditional p2p systems , the trust framework is usually applied for either enabling access control  @xcite or encouraging benign resource sharing  @xcite .",
    "seprep  @xcite establishes a general quality - of - service ( qos ) based trust framework for heterogeneous p2p networks . for mobile p2p networks ,",
    "@xcite proposes m - trust for accurate , robust and light - weight trust rating aggregation . in proliferating mcs applications",
    ", existing trust frameworks  @xcite mainly focus on evaluating the participator contribution from the data quality perspective . in  @xcite",
    ", a reputation - based trust framework is used to estimate the trustworthiness of a mobile device in location authentications , which is collaboratively conducted by proximal devices using bluetooth communications .",
    "overall , existing approaches maintain application - specific trustworthiness for self - interested entities , which is usually estimated using upper - level metrics without considering link - layer constrains .",
    "they can not be directly used to evaluate the trustworthiness of d2d communications in mcss .    the workshop abstract  @xcite presents the very initial idea of our tdp , while this paper establishes a much more complete and systematic trust management scheme with comprehensive theoretical analysis .",
    "furthermore , real - world experiments and extensive trace - driven simulations are also conducted to study the practical performance of tdp in realistic d2d - enabled mcss .",
    "in this section , we present the model of general d2d - enabled mcss and potential attacks to opportunistic d2d communications .",
    "the typical architecture of a d2d - enabled mcs is shown in fig.[fig1 ] : multiple participating personal mobile devices communicate with the backend server ( bs ) through the internet via wifi or cellular access points , and they communicate with devices opportunistically encountered through outband d2d radios such as bluetooth and wifi direct .    generally , the bs is responsible for the maintenance of the entire mcs by establishing system regulations , publishing crowdsourcing applications , publishing tasks and recording device profiles .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of all regulated mcs task types ( _ e.g. _ mobile social networking , crowdsensing , collaborative computing ) .    to participate in crowdsourcing tasks , personal mobile devices need to install the crowdsourcing application and register to the bs .",
    "let @xmath1 be the set of all registered devices .",
    "driven by a specific crowdsourcing task , any pair of registered devices can establish a secure d2d connection for further communications , which is denoted as a d2d transaction for the rest of the paper . a device @xmath2 can have a sequence of d2d transactions @xmath3 with any other device in @xmath1 .",
    "for the establishment of secure d2d connections , each device @xmath4 possesses a unique device pairing credential , which is verifiable to both the bs and any other registered device encountered .",
    "meanwhile , a ` trustvalue ' is maintained for each device according to its behavior in previous d2d transactions , which is treats as its trustworthiness to fulfill future transaction requests . here , the ` trustvalue ' is the predominant concern of the peer selection when there are multiple candidates .          considering the sensitivity of personal mobile devices , _ neither devices opportunistically encountered nor the bs",
    "should be fully trusted in mcss_.    intuitively , potential attacks launched by malicious devices within the d2d - enabled mcs can be divided into two categories : connection - oriented ( co ) attacks and traffic - oriented ( to ) attacks . on one hand ,",
    "co attackers intend to compromise the pairing process between encountered devices for illegal communication contents or mcs services .",
    "in fact , the prevention of co attacks is the predominant concentration of security mechanism of off - the - shelf d2d communication protocols ( _ e.g _ bluetooth  @xcite and wifi direct  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the to attackers are more interested in manipulating d2d traffics in mcss for simply unfair rewards ( _ e.g. _ popularity , credits ) or future advanced attacks ( _ e.g. _ false data injection attacks ) .",
    "unlike co attacks , as far as we know , there is still no systematic discussion on the impact and prevention of to attacks in mcss from the perspective of opportunistic d2d communications .",
    "we formally model these potential attacks as follows ( let there be devices @xmath5 ) :    * 1 .",
    "passvie - eavesdropping attack ( * co@xmath6 * ) * : any third party adversary @xmath7 , who is not the intended end @xmath8 or @xmath9 of a d2d transaction , tries to decrypt eavesdropped data ;    * 2 . impersonating attack ( co@xmath10 ) * : any adversary @xmath7 , except the device impersonated @xmath8 , tries to use @xmath8 s credential to establish d2d connections with others ;    * 3 .",
    "man - in - the - middle attack ( co@xmath11 ) * : any third party adversary @xmath7 , except both ends of a d2d transaction @xmath8 and @xmath9 , tries to intercept and replace @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) s credential to establish d2d connections with @xmath9 ( @xmath8 ) in middle without being noticed ;    * 4 .",
    "trust forging attack ( to@xmath6 ) * : any adversary @xmath7 forges its trustvalue to attract unfair d2d transaction requests ;    * 5 .",
    "independent negative attack ( to@xmath10 ) * : any adversary @xmath7 intentionally replies negative ratings ( continuously or intermittently ) to downgrade others trustvalue and consequently attract unfair d2d transaction requests ;    * 6 . collusive attack ( to@xmath11 ) * : any set of adversaries @xmath12 intentionally reply positive ratings to members within @xmath12 and negative ratings to others ( continuously or intermittently ) to attract unfair d2d transaction requests .",
    "moreover , we should treat the bs as ` benign but curious ' : generally , it will jeopardize neither the device pairing nor trust management process for public credibility ; meanwhile , it is curious about the content of d2d transactions among devices . in this case",
    ", the bs may try to launch co@xmath6 attacks as a third party adversary .",
    "in d2d - enabled mcss , the reliability of a device to fulfill future d2d requests can be reflected by its behavior in historical transactions . in this paper",
    ", we denote this reliability as the trustworthiness of a device , which is treated as the basic metric for the peer selection in device pairing process ( will be discussed latter ) .    in this section ,",
    "we develop an online method to : ( 1 ) accurately estimate the trustworthiness of participating devices according to their historical behaviors ; ( 2 ) selectively profile the device behavior during d2d transactions ; ( 3 ) adjust the device trustworthiness using behavior profiles at real - time .",
    "we use the term of ` trustvalue ' to quantitatively represent the trustworthiness of each device , and , for the authenticity concern , it can only be adjusted by the bs after each transaction according to the device behavior .",
    "mathematically , let the trustvalue of each device @xmath13 after its @xmath14 d2d transaction be a @xmath15-dimensional vector @xmath16 . here , the value of the @xmath17 @xmath18 entry of @xmath16 is a value within the range of @xmath19 $ ] , which represents the trustworthiness of @xmath8 fulfilling the @xmath17 type of d2d request ( for the corresponding type of mcs task ) .    since the trustworthiness of a device",
    "should be gradually built over a period of benign behaviors , we use the widely - adopted gompertz function  @xcite in reputation mapping to compute the device trustvalue : @xmath20 where , for a given vector @xmath21 , @xmath22 denotes calculating the value of the gompertz function : @xmath23 for each entry of vector @xmath21 , and the parameter @xmath24 determines the sensitivity of trustvalue variation along time .",
    "@xmath25 is the estimation of @xmath8 s behavior at its @xmath14 transaction , which is computed by the bs according to behavior profiles uploaded by participating devices ( will be explained later ) .      for each d2d transaction , both ends of the transaction profile necessary information that can objectively reflect each other s behavior , which is then recorded in a d2d receipt respectively for future trustvalue adjustment at the bs .",
    "intuitively , for a reasonable profiling of the @xmath14 d2d transaction of a device @xmath2 ( with its peer device @xmath9 ) , the following four factors should be recorded in @xmath8 s receipt ( omitting index @xmath26 for concision ) : the quality - of - service ( qos ) provided by the d2d link @xmath27 , the credibility of @xmath9 from @xmath8 s perspective @xmath28 , the rating from @xmath9 on @xmath8 s behavior @xmath29 , and the type of the current transaction @xmath30 .",
    "following is their specific definitions .",
    "* qos * : we use the link - layer qos value @xmath27 to denote the quality of the d2d link constructed by a given pair of encountered devices @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "different qos metrics are used according to different d2d transactions , such as transmission delay , data rate , or packet loss rate .",
    "for example , image - based applications would require high data rate , while event - monitoring tasks need small delay . in our system",
    ", @xmath27 is a normalized value that can be obtained by both @xmath8 and @xmath9 during their transactions .",
    "we use link - layer qos because it can precisely reflect the application - layer qos ( due to the one - hop nature of d2d transactions ) , and it is much easier to be estimated in practice .",
    "for instance , if the minimal possible delay for transmitting a given - size packet over a d2d link is 10 ms ( computed using datasheet ) , and the actual per - packet delay is 40 ms ( measured online ) , then the qos value can be normalized as @xmath31 .",
    "* credibility * : the credibility estimation between encountered devices is important for the evaluation of current behavior of each other , considering their historical knowledge . in practice , it is reasonable for a person to consider a stranger credible if their judges to any common third party are similar . inspired by this , we estimate @xmath28 based on the comparability of contact histories of both device @xmath8 and device @xmath9 . without loss of generality , let device @xmath8 s contact history @xmath32 be a set of devices that @xmath8 has paired with during a trust management cycle regulated by the bs",
    ". for each device @xmath33 , a value @xmath34 that denotes the percentage of positive ratings from @xmath8 to @xmath35 is also maintained by @xmath8 , which is recorded in a vector @xmath36 according to the encountering order of device @xmath35 .",
    "@xmath34 will be refreshed according to the rating from device @xmath8 to device @xmath35 whenever they finish a d2d transaction .",
    "specifically , @xmath28 is defined as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the similarity between percentages of positive ratings separately replied by @xmath8 and @xmath9 to other devices , @xmath39 is the relative diversity of percentages of positive ratings separately replied by @xmath8 and @xmath9 to other devices , @xmath40 within the range of @xmath19 $ ] is used to adjust the focus of the credibility estimation , and @xmath41 is the damping factor that is inversely proportion of the intimacy between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    in eq.([eq3 ] ) , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are defined as : @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is calculated as : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is @xmath48 s dimensions , and @xmath49 is @xmath48 s @xmath50 entry .",
    "@xmath41 is used to restrict the credibility estimation between devices that contact more frequently than normal , which is defined as : @xmath51 where parameter @xmath52 determines the sensitivity of credibility damping , @xmath53 is the transaction count between @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath54 is the average transaction count of all devices within a trust management cycle regulated by the bs .",
    "* rating * : the rating indicates the satisfactory of a device on the behavior of its peer device in the current d2d transaction , which is determined by the comparison of the qos and credibility of the current transaction with that of historical transactions with any device . for the transaction between devices @xmath8 and @xmath9 : @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the ewmas of historical qos and credibility that are locally updated by device @xmath8 after each transaction , and @xmath58 within the range of @xmath19 $ ] is used to adjust the focus of the rating decision .",
    "* transaction type * : the type of the current transaction is profiled to estimate the trustworthiness of a device fulfilling d2d requests from different type of mcs tasks respectively .",
    "for a normalized and comparable profiling , we define @xmath30 as a @xmath15-dimensional vector to represent a d2d transaction that is initiated from device @xmath8 .",

    "the value of the @xmath17 entry indicates resources ( computing / communicating ) that are contributed by such a transaction , _ e.g. _ bandwidth , which is determined according to the criteria regulated by the bs .      according to the uploaded receipts",
    ", the bs can estimate the behavior of a device in a d2d transaction .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath14 transaction of a device @xmath2 ( with its peer device @xmath9 ) , the bs can obtain @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 from @xmath8 s receipt .    from the bs s perspective , one more thing should be considered is that d2d transactions required by different crowdsourcing tasks lead to different device trustvalue adjustment patterns ( _ i.e. _ which end of the transaction should have a trustvalue adjustment ) .",
    "for instance , for an outsourced collaborative computing task , both ends of the d2d transaction should have trustvalue adjustments because of their equal contributions to task offloading .    without loss of generality , for @xmath62",
    ", the trustvalue adjustment pattern @xmath63 is defined as an element of set @xmath64 that indicates whether the initiator ( indicated by the @xmath65 entry , role @xmath66 ) or the peer ( indicated by the @xmath67 entry , role @xmath68 ) should have a trustvalue adjustment .",
    "let @xmath69 be the whole set of the transaction types ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "it is viable for the bs to establish a mapping : @xmath71 that indicates which end of the transaction should have a trustvalue adjustment according to the transaction type .    in this case , for the bs , the behavior estimation of device @xmath8 in its @xmath14 transaction @xmath25 in eq.([eq1 ] ) is computed as ( omitting index @xmath26 for concision ) : @xmath72      for the bootstrapping of the device trustvalue , an initial value of @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is issued when the device joins the mcs . besides , for two devices freshly encountered ( _ e.g. _ @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath75 , @xmath76 or @xmath77 is 0 ) , the weight factor of rating @xmath58 is set as @xmath78 to neglect the credibility factor .",
    "therefore , any device that freshly joins the mcs will not be starved and is guaranteed a fair probability to be involved as long as behaving well in d2d transactions .      in this subsection",
    ", we firstly provide justifications for the trustvalue definition and device behavior profiling , then we conduct comparisons between our method and the josang model  @xcite in the d2d - enabled mcs scenario .",
    "intuitively , we estimate the trustworthiness of a device performing d2d transactions according to its historical behaviors .",
    "the trustvalue of a device is determined by the accumulation of its quantified behavior profiles ( eq.([eq1 ] ) ) .",
    "considering that any freshly joint device with continuously positive ( negative ) behaviors deserves a rapid trustvalue enhancement ( decrement ) , and that the trustvalue itself should be normalized for effective comparisons , we use a type of sigmoid function , _ i.e. _ the gompertz function  @xcite @xmath79 ( see fig.a1 ( a ) in appendix a.1 ) , to map the behavior accumulation to the device trustvalue .",
    "any other function with similar properties , _",
    "e.g. _ the logistic function  @xcite @xmath80 ( see fig.a1 ( a ) in appendix a.1 ) , is also applicable in trustworthiness mapping .",
    "one thing should be noted is that the value of @xmath24 determines the sensitivity of trustvalue variations .",
    "we provide an instance for @xmath24 determination in appendix a.1 .",
    "intuitively , to stimulate more d2d transactions , devices with benign and stable behaviors in extensive active scopes should be guaranteed higher credibilities .",
    "the first metric of credibility estimation is the comparability of the behavior profiles separatively maintained by both ends of the transaction .",
    "we assume that devices strictly following mcs regulations receive relatively similar ratings from different devices , then the comparability is quantified by the similarity ( eq.([eq4 ] ) ) and the relative diversity ( eq.([eq5 ] ) ) of their contact histories .",
    "specifically , the similarity estimation encourages devices to objectively reflect other s behavior through justifiable ratings , while that the diversity estimation restricts devices from downgrading other s trustvalue with extreme or discriminative ratings .",
    "besides , to prevent the potential trustvalue boost caused by massive meaningless d2d transactions between collusive devices , the intimacy between both ends of a transaction is treated as a damping factor of their credibility ( eq.([eq7 ] ) ) , _ i.e. _ suspiciously frequent contacts lead to rapid credibility decreases .",
    "we use a type of monotonic descending function , _",
    "i.e. _ a quadratic function @xmath81 , to represent the relation between the device contact number @xmath82 and the damping factor @xmath83 ( see fig.a2 ( a ) in appendix a.2 ) . any other function with similar properties , _",
    "e.g. _ a cubic function @xmath84 ( see fig.a2 ( a ) in appendix a.2 ) , is also applicable .",

    "however , their sensitivities are obviously different : for more extreme cases ( _ i.e. _ 20% and 80% ) , our method guarantees a gradual accumulation of the device trustworthiness , whereas the josang model just presents a rapid trust convergence ; for the neutral case ( _ i.e. _ 50% ) , our device trustworthiness is adjusted more sensitively because of more objective device behavior estimations .    in the second set of simulations",

    "not only guarantees a better objectivity but also provides devices a fair chance to attract more transactions with better behaviors .",
    "with the accurate trustworthiness estimated by the method in section [ sec4 ] , in this section , we develop tdp to realize rapid , user - transparent , and trustworthy device pairing for d2d - enabled mcss .      considering the security threats in subsection [ subsec32 ]",

    "the purpose for this determination is to alleviate the trustvalue enhancement for devices whose contact frequencies are beyond the average . according to fig.[figa11 ] ( b ) , for any registered device @xmath8 , the climbing rate @xmath213 reaches its maximum value when @xmath214 .",
    "this indicates that the trustvalue adjustment for a freshly joint device is relatively sensitive .",

    "in fact , if device @xmath8 behaves well continuously , it s trustvalue will accordingly raise with three phases : a rapid enhancement , an intense damping on the climbing rate , and a relatively steady .",
