    "in classical studies of phase transformations , kinetic laws allow a global description of volume phase as a function of time evolution thus distinguishing them from growth laws .",
    "however , growth laws translate a local microscopic modeling of phase transformation phenomena and provide the construction of kinetic laws from microscopic observation and ( or ) models .",
    "both approaches exist in mechanical alloying ( ma ) although they are rarely explicit in the literature .",
    "ma is a cheap , efficient , and flexible technique ( see the survey by suryanarayana  @xcite ) which has attracted much attention from scientists of various research areas .",
    "recently , ma has been used to produce materials for biological application  @xcite and to investigate the spin - glass character of nanograin boundaries  @xcite , amongst many other applications .",
    "although much of the research is based on empirical conclusions obtained directly from experimental results , there has been some attempts to make a quantitative description of ma .",
    "a quantitative description is very important and necessary in order to provide a way to establish predictable capabilities for the ma processes  @xcite .",
    "abdellaoui and gaffet  @xcite have shown that neither the shock energy nor the shock frequency govern the ni@xmath0zr@xmath1 amorphization process in a planetary ball mill if taken into account separately .",
    "only the injected shock power is responsible for the ball milled final product . in another study of ni - zr amorphization ,",
    "chen  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , using a vertical vibrating frame grinder , have found that these compounds become fully amorphized if a defined milling intensity ( @xmath2 ) is greater than a threshold value .",
    "the milling intensity is defined as : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the ball mass , @xmath5 is the maximum velocity of the ball , @xmath6 the impact frequency , and @xmath7 the mass of the powder in the vial .",
    "therefore , according to  @xcite , the same final product can be achieved by transfering large momentum with low frequencies or small momentum with high frequencies .",
    "these two approaches , while successful in describing individual processes in particular types of mill , have some built in difficulties that prevent them to fully describe a general ma experiment .",
    "the shock power proposed in  @xcite is a function of balls kinetic energy and impact frequency .",
    "however , in a planetary mill , both parameters are functions of the velocity of the balls in the sense that the faster a ball moves , the higher its kinetic energy and the more times it will suffer impacts . moreover , in the vertical vibrating mill used to investigate the role of the milling intensity  @xcite , the shock frequency is determined by the inverse of the time taken by ball to move up and down .",
    "this time is proportional ( and as a consequence the frequency is inversely proportional ) to potential energy .",
    "the velocity @xmath5 is itself proportional to potential energy which makes the product @xmath8 close to a constant value .",
    "these two approaches also neglect the importance of the material s response to the impacts .",
    "ma is a `` far from equilibrium technique '' and despite its dynamic characteristics yavari _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have employed equilibrium thermodynamics to explain the ma mechanism .",
    "pure elements form nanocrystalline structures after severe mechanical deformation and the energy stored in the large grain boundaries could be the driving force during alloying . examining the immiscible fe - cu system prepared by mechanical alloying , yavari _ et al .",
    "_ have shown that the available interfacial energy is not enough to compensate the positive enthalpy of mixing . however , repeated fractures break the particles into very small fragments with high free energies which dissolve themselves into the matrix by the gibbs - thomson effect .",

    "@xcite have proposed a global kinetic law for ma of iron carbides : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the transformed phase volume and @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are empirical constants .",
    "they have proposed that @xmath13 is connected to impact energies and @xmath12 is related to `` work conditions '' .",
    "the value of @xmath11 sets the scale .    in a previous work",
    "@xcite , we reported a discussion about the ma process based on experimental and numerical results .",
    "a nanocrystaline fcc - fecu solid solution was obtained by ma and analyzed by x - ray diffraction , mssbauer spectroscopy , and differential calorimetry .",
    "in addition , simulations of the material behavior during uniaxial deformations , compatible with what we expect on an impact were performed using molecular dynamics .",
    "we claimed that the number of balls in the mill vial , which is related to impact frequency , did not affect the energy transfer processes , but rather only the reaction rates .",
    "this finding has recently been confirmed by girot _",
    "et al . _",
    "we also showed that a local description of ma process is necessary in order to understand its driving mechanisms and that many factors such as ; powder deformation by the milling tools , chemical and physical properties of materials , strain / stress fields , and collision energies have to be taken in account together to describe ma .",
    "this view was recently raised in the review by takacs  @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we propose and develop a model as an attempt to describe the local mechanism of ma .",
    "this model is based on the phase volume transformations during the process and is applied to milled fe - cu and fe - n experimental results obtained previously  @xcite .",
    "our first step to understand ma mechanisms is to investigate how the phase transformations are driven in the course of the process .",
    "this can be done using measured global parameters such as the phase volumes .",
    "if a given phase @xmath14 occupies a volume @xmath15 in the total volume @xmath16 , then the concentration @xmath17 is given by : @xmath18    ma is essentially a discrete process characterized by discrete energy transfers taking place at individual impacts  @xcite , which means that only a small fraction of the powder is processed at each event .",
    "moreover , a particle of powder under an impact has no memory from the previous impacts  @xcite .",
    "significant powder transformations occurring during milling impacts are confined in a small volume @xmath19 which is the powder volume trapped by the milling tools , as suggested in  @xcite .",

    "we used the fe@xmath63cu@xmath64 system studied in a previous work @xcite to perform an analysis of phase volume evolution as described in eq .",

    "we used a _",

    "the fe - cu samples were prepared by ball milling using commercial fe and cu metallic powders . in the course of milling ,",
    "the iron atoms are incorporated into the fcc copper matrix so that at any time during the process , there are fractions of the initial bcc fe and fcc cu and an amount of transformed fcc fecu solid solution .",
    "the observed trend is that of total incorporation of iron by the fcc matrix resulting on fcc fecu alone  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath69 reaction obtained by ma studied in a previous work  @xcite is also a good application for the model discussed in this contribution .",
    "the transformation was followed through the volume fraction of @xmath70 since the existence domain of this paramagnetic phase is relatively narrow .",
    "in addition to this , the system @xmath71 is two - phased , composed by a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase ; also the reaction product ( @xmath72 ) is ferromagnetic .",
    "therefore , the phase volume of the paramagnetic @xmath70 can be easily separated by mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "it is the area of the doublet subspectra of fig .",

    "one can also find a metastable long range ordered phase @xmath79 .",

    "what can be observed is that during most of the milling of @xmath82 , the system is mainly composed of @xmath73 , @xmath75 and @xmath83 .",
    "previous studies about curie temperature  @xcite are nt useful because differences in nitrogen composition lead to diverse magnetic behavior  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "almost any variation on nitrogen content leads to appearance of ferromagnetic phases , with only @xmath83 remaining paramagnetic .",
    "after just few minutes of alloying it is no longer possible to distinguish between different phases by x - ray diffraction .",

    "we assume the number of impacts per unit time between balls and the vial wall equals the number of balls in the vial . in this way , there are at least @xmath85 times as many impacts in the experiment with 12 balls .",
    "a correction to be made refers to the different number of impacts between balls in each experiment .",
    "it is virtually impossible to calculate such a number due to the nearly unpredictable dynamics of the balls in the vial .",

    "we modify the 12 balls curve by multiplying time ( and dividing @xmath88 ) by @xmath86 .",

    "[ figtribo ] reveals four distinguished stages .",
    "the first one is a static activation stage where the system only stores energy and no chemical reaction occurs  @xcite .",
    "the second stage is characterized by the start of reaction followed by an increase of reaction speed .",
    "in fact , the reaction occurs only in the bcc / fcc interface and so this acceleration is expected when total surface increases ( grain size decreases ) like in fig .",

    "the third stage is characterized by a decrease in the reaction rate . during this stage ,",
    "the amount of iron dissolved in the copper matrix approaches the solubility limit of @xmath9060%  @xcite , which explains the decrease .",
    "the fourth and last stage is characterized by a zero @xmath68 value revealing that stationary stage is reached .",
    "in contrast to what one can observe in the fe - cu formation process , the tribochemical activity for the fe - n system shown in fig .",
    "[ figtribonit ] reveals large reactivity from the beginning of the process ( @xmath91 is large when @xmath92 ) .",
    "moreover , the reactivity seems to be proportional to the concentration gradient between the two phases ( @xmath93 and @xmath70 ) and the reaction rate increases due to an ever growing interface between @xmath70 and @xmath93 ( grain size reduction ) .",
    "in fact , the fe - cu is an endothermic system and energy storage is necessary in order to trigger the reaction .",
    "this does not occur in the exothermic @xmath71 reaction .",
    "it can also be observed that the absolute value of @xmath94 is a monotonic time function showing that saturation has not been achieved , and that there was no reduction of reagents reactivity capacity .",
    "the reaction stops because of the reactants extinction .",
    "this is another contrast to the fe - cu system in which a stationary stage is reached .",
    "the presence of a stationary stage with zero @xmath88 in the end of the fe - cu processing suggests us that there might be some unreacted amount of material left over .",
    "this fact calls for adjustment in eq .",
    "[ eqmatteazzi ] .",
    "since the fe - cu reactions reached saturation , it is reasonable to believe that there should be a constant term in eq .",

    "one could obtain fittings as good as these ones using many different expressions .",
    "however , although the aim of the analysis made here is not to establish the absolute validity of the law in eqs .",
    "[ eqmatteazzi ] and  [ eqmatteazzimod ] , it provides further insights on the usefulness of the tribochemical activity approach .",
    "table  [ tabfit ] shows the values of coefficients @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath97 obtained from numerical fitting of tribochemical activity time evolution curves to eqs .",
    "[ eqksicoefendo ] and  [ eqksicoefexo ] where the coefficient @xmath97 applies to the former but not to the latter . comparing the values obtained from the two fe - cu experiments ( with 4 and 12 balls ) we see that the values of coefficient @xmath12 are quite different , which is in accordance to the proposed relation of them to `` work conditions '' .",
    "the values of @xmath13 from both experiments are very similar .",
    "this was expected since @xmath13 should be connected to impact energies and both experiments were performed with rotational frequency of 350 rpm . as a consequence",
    ", approximately the same amount of energy is transferred to the powder in both experiments and the local kinetics of both reactions are the same , despite the different number of balls .",
    "this analysis strengthens the suggestion that the shock frequency is only a milling condition and does not play a role in the energy transfer process , i.e. , it is not a fundamental parameter of the process .",
    "the values of @xmath11 and @xmath97 are virtually the same since one process differs from the other by only the time scale . moreover , according to tab .",
    "[ tabfit ] , @xmath13 is less than 2 for the exothermic fe - n system in contrast to the endothermic fe - cu system where @xmath13 is greater than 2 .",
    "these numbers are in accordance to the previous discussion . in this way , not only is @xmath13 connected to impact energies as suggested in  @xcite , but also reflects the endothermic or exothermic nature of the reaction .",
    "the formulation of the tribochemical activity concept provides a clear way to understand the evolution of phase transformations during ma .",
    "this is an initial attempt to describe the growth laws from global kinetics . using this description it is possible to follow grain sizes , gradient of concentration and milling condition without chemical conditions .",
    "the time evolution of tribochemical activity allows the identification of four distinct stages in the milling of fe - cu system : energy storage , reaction initiation and rate increase , reaction rate decrease , and stationary .",
    "these stages are in perfect agreement to the experimental observations .",
    "the energy storage stage is not identified in the @xmath110 reaction because of the exothermic nature of this system . moreover",
    ", the monotonous character of the @xmath111 function shows that saturation is not achieved .",
    "the striking difference between @xmath88 behavior for fe - n and fe - cu reflects the respective exothermic and endothermic nature of the reactions .",
    "achievement of a saturation stage in fe - cu processes suggests the existence of some amount of unreacted material left over .",
    "this fact calls for modification on the global kinetics law proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the small adjustment introduced extends the validity of the law to endothermic and exothermic processes and imposes a threshold to the characteristic exponent .",
    "further analysis of the two fe - cu tribochemical activity curves suggests that impact frequency does not play an important role in the final product process .",
    "this is stressed by the values obtained from the numerical fitting of the phase volume and @xmath88 time evolutions .    at this point",
    ", it is really hard , and certainly premature , to assert that the tribochemical activity approach is definitive , but it definitely makes it clearer that the right path to fully understand the ma processes should bend more and more toward its description in terms of growth laws .",
    "such description provides some clues about which parameters actually drive ma mechanisms , and also provides a means to separate out surface , mechanical impacts , and thermodynamics terms . the rather different tribochemical activity behavior for the fe - cu and fe - n systems might explain the broad diversity and incompatibility among various ma models present in the literature .",

    "<S> we propose and develop a model as an attempt to describe the local mechanism of mechanical alloying . </S>",
    "<S> this model is based on the observation of global parameters , such as the volumes of the various phases present in the material , and their transformations during the process . </S>",
    "<S> the model is applied to milled fe - cu and fe - n experimental results obtained in previous works  @xcite . in the milling of fe - cu system , four stages , </S>",
    "<S> whose features are in accordance with experimental observation , are identified:(i ) energy storage ; ( ii ) initiation of reaction and rate increase ; ( iii ) decrease of the reaction rate and ( iv ) stationary stage . no energy storage stage is observed and no saturation is achieved in the milling of fe - n system . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we propose a modification on the global kinetic law introduced in  @xcite based on the different nature of fe - cu and fe - n systems . </S>",
    "<S> this modification allows the extension of the validity of this law . </S>"
