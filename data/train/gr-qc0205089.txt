    "recent publications @xcite report observations of distant quasars absorption lines , which may indicate a time variation of the fine structure constant @xmath0 .",
    "different kinds of explications have been proposed ( see in conclusion ) , which all involve new physics @xcite .",
    "since many theoretical arguments suggest that our present theories of physical interactions are not the ultimate ones , this possibility deserves serious attention .",
    "an ultimate theory would include additional fields and coupling which remain presently unknown . at the effective level , and in particular in astrophysical conditions , those can be manifest as a soft dependence of the constants \" of the interactions with some parameters .",
    "for instance , the effective theory considered here predicts a variation of the effective gravitatonal constant @xmath1 with respect to electromagnetic conditions , and a variation of the effective @xmath0 with respect to gravitational conditions , and thus with the cosmic time ( seen as a parameter expressing the variation of the cosmic gravitational potential , through the friedmann - lematre equations ) . in this paper , we calculate the expected variation of  @xmath0 , and compare it with astronomical observations . in a companion paper ( @xcite ) , we have shown that the predicted dependence of @xmath2 with the value of the geomagnetic field , in the same framework , may explain the discordant terrestrial measurements of the gravitational constant .",
    "one of the simplest effective theories that it is possible to build ( beside brans - dicke type theories ) results from the compactification of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) one . as we show here",
    "( see also @xcite ) , this leads to replace the gravitational constant @xmath1 and the fine structure constant @xmath0 by _ effective values _ , which vary with the scalar field @xmath3 introduced in the theory .",
    "on the other hand , different authors @xcite have pointed out that a pure kk action leads to instability of the theory , because of the bad sign for the kinetic term of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the same authors suggested the presence of an additional field to cure this problem .",
    "in a previous study @xcite , we applied an argument initially from landau and lifshitz @xcite , to study this instability , and we proposed a minimal hypothesis for stabilization : the addition of an external field @xmath4 .",
    "thus we consider this modified kk theory ( hereafter kk@xmath4 ) as the simplest candidates for an effective theory , a prototype to explore the possibility that the observational results are due to a coupling between gravitation and electromagnetism ( hereafter ge coupling ) .",
    "seen in our 4-dimensional space - time , the kk@xmath4 lagrangian leads to a theory of gravitation and electromagnetism , with the additional fields @xmath3 ( internal kk field ) and @xmath4 ( external stabilizing field ) .",
    "the latter induce a ge coupling , which appears precisely as a dependence of the ( effective ) constants @xmath2 and @xmath5 with respect to other fields .",
    "this paper explores the cosmic evolution of @xmath5 generated by that of matter and gravitation ( spacetime curvature ) .    in section 2",
    ", we calculate the variations predicted by the kk@xmath4 theory : section 2.1 recalls the definition of the effective coupling constants , and gives the effective maxwell - einstein equations in the context of the compactified kk theory ; section 2.2 introduces the kk@xmath4 lagrangian and the resulting equations ( maxwell - einstein and scalar fields evolutions ) ; section 2.3 considers the cosmological solution ( weak fields limit , in the matter - dominated epoch ) . in section 3 , we compare our calculations of the cosmological evolution of the fine structure constant with the avalaible data from distant quasars absorption lines . also , we discuss the consistency of our results especially with respect to the oklo phenomenon . in section 4 , the similarities and differences with other work are emphasized .",
    "the original kk theory , after dimensional reduction , leads to the effective action in the jordan - fierz frame ( _ e.g. _ , see @xcite ) @xmath6 \\,d^{4}x,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the potential 4-vector of the electromagnetic field , @xmath8 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor , @xmath3 the ( internal ) scalar field related by @xmath9 to the fifteenth degree of freedom , @xmath10 , of the 5-dimensional metric and @xmath1 the ( true ) gravitational constant . we emphasize that this is _ not _ a theory with minimally coupled scalar field . according to lichnerowicz @xcite , the quantity @xmath11 of the einstein - hilbert term , and the factor @xmath12 of the maxwell term in ( [ kk action j - f frame ] ) , should be interpreted respectively as the effective gravitational constant \" and the effective vacuum dielectric permittivity .",
    "these terms depend on the local ( for terrestrial experiments ) or global ( at cosmological scale ) value of @xmath3 , assumed to be positive defined .",
    "clearly , the previous considerations lead to an _ effective _ fine structure constant @xmath13 to be compared to the _ true _ fine structure constant @xmath14 .",
    "it is worth noticing that this does not involve any variation of the electric charge , unlike the earlier suggestion of bekenstein @xcite .",
    "also , the velocity of light remains constant since the value of the effective vacuum magnetic permeability , @xmath15 , insures @xmath16 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "applying the least action principle to the action ( [ kk action j - f frame ] ) yields    * the generalized einstein - maxwell equations with the additional source term @xmath17 in addition to the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor @xmath18 .",
    "they identify to the usual expressions , where @xmath1 and @xmath19 are replaced respectively by @xmath2 and @xmath20 . * the kk scalar field equation @xmath21      to stabilize the kk action ( @xcite ) , the simplest possibility is to introduce an additional matter field : a real bulk scalar field minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "after dimensional reduction , this field appears as a scalar field @xmath4 in spacetime , with the effective action ( in the jordan - fierz frame ) @xmath22 \\,d^{4}x,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 denotes the self - interaction potential of @xmath4 and @xmath24 its source term .",
    "the latter includes contributions from the matter and from @xmath3 , both proportional to the trace of their energy - momentum tensor , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath25 , and that of the ( traceless ) electromagnetic field , @xmath26 . generally speaking these coupling functions are temperature dependent , with magnitude decreasing as the temperature increases ( this prevents from any significant modification of the big bang nucleosynthesis ) .",
    "the necessity to recover the usual physics whenever the @xmath4-field is not excited requires @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we have written @xmath29 the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath4 , such that @xmath30 ( definition of the vev of @xmath4 ) .",
    "the definition of @xmath2 implies that the vev of  @xmath3 is 1 .    applying the variational principle to ( [ kk action and psi j - f frame ] ) yields @xmath31 and @xmath32 the effective einstein equations are unchanged , apart from a new source term : the effective energy momentum tensor of @xmath4 , @xmath33.\\ ] ] since we know that , for the effects examined here , the effective values are close to the usual one , we linearize the two scalar fields around their respective vevs .",
    "hence , equations ( [ ext . scalar field eq ] , [ stabilized kk scalar eq ] ) above reduce to @xmath34 and @xmath35      for cosmology , we assume spatially constant values of the fields and we follow their evolutions with respect to the cosmic time , @xmath36 . hence , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "besides , @xmath39 vanishes for the pure em cosmic background radiation .",
    "thus , the cosmological equations reduce to the effective friedmann equation ( with a cosmological constant @xmath40 ) @xmath41 @xmath42 and , for the scalar fields , @xmath43 @xmath44 the dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time , @xmath45 is the expansion rate ( hubble parameter ) , @xmath46 the scale factor , @xmath47 is the spatial curvature parameter and  @xmath48 the pressure ; we have set @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the smallness of the observed effects implies @xmath51 , @xmath52 , whereas the consistency of the model implies @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( all confirmed by the numerical calculations below ) .",
    "hence , the small excitations of the scalar fields do not modify significantly the variation of the scale factor with respect to the cosmic time .",
    "as this is suggested by observations , we assume zero spatial curvature .",
    "let us emphasize that equation ( [ eq phi j - f cosmological rho approx 1 ] ) implies that the extrema of @xmath3 are necessary maxima during the matter or matter-@xmath40 dominated era ( present era ) . on account of equation ( [ eq psi j - f cosmological rho approx 1 ] )",
    ", the same conclusion applies to @xmath4 under the condition @xmath55 ( choosing @xmath56 would lead to minima of @xmath4 , instead ) .      before the recombination",
    ", the content of the universe is well described by the equation of state @xmath57 ( matter negligible , no spatial curvature ) : putting @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , we obtain @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the present time .",
    "the solutions of equations ( [ eq psi j - f cosmological rho approx 1 radiation era ] ) and ( [ eq phi j - f cosmological rho approx 1 radiation era ] ) take the forms @xmath64 and @xmath65 \\,\\ , ( \\,\\frac{t_{d}}{t } \\,)^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 denotes the epoch of matter - radiation decoupling . now , requiring that both @xmath4 and @xmath3 be bounded at any time past the big bang involves @xmath69 and @xmath70 . hence , both scalar fields remain constant and equal to their respective vev , during the radiation era . as a consequence",
    ", the effective fine structure constant identifies to the true fine structure constant during the radiation era .",
    "after recombination , the matter and the cosmological constant play their role .",
    "we explore two different cosmological models : first , in this section , an einstein - de sitter model , with no cosmological constant and the critical density ( no spatial curvature , no pressure ) . in the next section",
    "we explore a more realistic model with a cosmological constant .",

    "* the future universe ( cosmological constant era ) * + in the future of the universe , the matter density and pressure become quite negligible with respect to the @xmath40 term : @xmath111 , still no spatial curvature .",
    "putting @xmath112 assuming @xmath113 , we obtain @xmath114 @xmath115 the solutions of equations ( [ eq psi j - f cosmological rho approx 1 lambda era ] ) and ( [ eq phi j - f cosmological rho approx 1 lambda era ] ) are respectively of the same form as ( [ sol .",
    "psi j - f cosmological rho approx 1 radiation era ] ) and ( [ sol .",
    "eq phi j - f cosmological rho approx 1 radiation era ] ) .",
    "hence , each scalar field tends to a constant equal to its vev , during the cosmological constant era . as a consequence , here",
    "again the effective fine structure constant will approach asymptotically the true fine structure constant .",
    "we compare our prediction ( [ alphaeff ] ) of the time variation of @xmath116 , for the two different cosmological models , with the observational data .",
    "a quasar of redshift @xmath117 emits photons at @xmath118 , that we receive at @xmath63 on earth .",
    "defining @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 , a least - squares fit to the observational data ( figure 1 of @xcite ) gives ,    * for @xmath122 : @xmath123 and @xmath124 , with @xmath125 per degree of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "+ * for @xmath126 : @xmath127 and @xmath128 , with @xmath129 per dof .",
    "figure 1 shows , in the same plot , the observational results @xcite and our theoretical prediction ( [ alphaeff ] ) of @xmath130 versus the redshift , for our two models @xmath122 and @xmath126 ( assuming no spatial curvature ) .",
    "+ the consistency of the recent observation from the distant quasars absorption line spectra with the constraints from the oklo uranium deposit have been discussed in @xcite . at the corresponding redshift ,",
    "our best fits imply ( assuming a spatially flat universe ) : + @xmath131 for @xmath122 + @xmath132 for @xmath133 .",
    "+ including the oklo point in the fit modify the @xmath134 as indicated in the figure caption , and we conclude that our two best fits are consistent with the oklo bounds .",
    "this gives an averaged decreasing rate approximately equal to @xmath135 per year , consistent with the recent analyses @xcite on account of the remark made in @xcite and in @xcite for the case of a non - linear time - evolution in @xmath136 .",
    "note that this implies also a non trivial cosmic evolution for g@xmath137 which yields @xmath138 per year at present , consistent with all the current bounds .",
    "in the radiation dominated era , energy is present in the form of radiation only , so that the source terms for the scalar fields ( equ . [ eq psi j - f cosmological rho approx 1 radiation era ] and [ eq phi j - f cosmological rho approx 1 radiation era ] ) cancel .",
    "therefore , both @xmath4 and @xmath3 remain close to their respective vev s . as a consequence ,",
    "the effective fine structure constant @xmath139 remains practically constant and close to the true fine structure constant @xmath0 .",
    "it follows both for bbn and at @xmath140 ( the epoch of matter - radiation decoupling ) , that @xmath141 , much below the present observational bound ( model dependent ) which gives @xmath142 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ at the onset of the matter-@xmath40 dominated era , the scalar fields will continuously start to vary ( @xmath3 increases ) , though at a lesser extent than the density the ordinary matter .",
    "the hubble friction term introduces a relaxation time @xmath143 of the order @xmath144 .",
    "this provides a natural and sufficient way of driving back @xmath139 ( @xmath145 ) to its constant value , @xmath0 , after a lapse of time of a few @xmath143 . as an estimate ,",
    "let us consider the einstein - de sitter cosmology : after @xmath146 , one gets @xmath147 . since @xmath148 during the radiation dominated era , it follows @xmath149 .",
    "hence , @xmath150 as observed , on account of the bound on the variation of the fine structure constant at bbn . + variations of the effective weak and strong coupling constants are also expected in the higher dimensional theories candidates for unification .",
    "the properties of the fundamental interactions are connected to the topological properties of the compactified extradimensions .",
    "such theories involve more than one extradimension in order to encompass all of the gauge groups of the standard model of particle physics . in this framework",
    ", the effective constants of the gauge fields would be expressed as functions of additional internal fields @xmath151 .",
    "the effective electromagnetic ( fine structure constant ) , weak and strong coupling constants would be written , respectively , as @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "the functions @xmath155 and @xmath156 are related to each other , because of the electroweak unification ; and to @xmath157 , if an unification scheme is already present .",
    "hence , we expect , at any given time scale ( dropping the @xmath158 indexes for clarity ) : @xmath159 and @xmath160 . expecting the ratios @xmath161 and @xmath162 of the order unity , the three rates @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 should be comparable , both at bbn and at the epoch of the oklo phenomenon ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ we conclude that our modified kaluza - klein type action provides a good effective description of interactions at low energy .",
    "the instability problem @xcite is cured by the introduction of an additional external bulk scalar field minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "it accounts naturally for a cosmological time variation of @xmath0 , in agreement with recent data .",
    "it also reconcile the discordant laboratory measurements of @xmath1 , by interpreting their differences as due to a coupling with the dipolar magnetic field of the earth @xcite .",
    "+ compared to other explanations , our assumption appears as an economical extension of general relativity . like in the barrow - sandvik - magueijo ( bsm )",
    "work @xcite , the variation of the effective fine structure constant is related to the coupling of a scalar field to the maxwell invariant @xmath166 .",
    "likewise , the effective fine structure constant remains constant during the radiation era .",
    "however , in contrast to bsm who predicts the suppression of the changes in @xmath139 in the @xmath40 dominated era , in our model the effective constants start to vary at the onset of the matter - cosmological constant dominated era .",
    "further , bsm find that the product @xmath167 should approach an asymptotic constant , whereas in this paper it is the quotient @xmath168 that remains approximately constant during the cosmic evolution , since @xmath2 and @xmath139 vary respectively as @xmath169 and approximately @xmath170 .",
    "above all , the velocity of light in vacuum remains constant , as well as the electric charges .",
    "moreover , our model derives from a very simple geometrical hypothesis .",
    "the first scalar field @xmath3 ( the fifteen degree of freedom of the metric ) is purely geometric , and thus part of gravity in 5d .",
    "it affects directly the fine structure constant and the gravitational constant . in contrary to @xmath4 ,",
    "it is not minimally coupled to gravity ( in 4d ) .",
    "moreover , any kind of matter ( except @xmath4 itself ) acts as a source for the external scalar field @xmath4 , and not only the em field like in the bsm work .",
