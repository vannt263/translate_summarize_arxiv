    "many models of statistical physics and condensed matter are defined on a lattice .",
    "the phase diagram of a lattice model usually depends on the lattice type , the range and strength of interactions , as well as other details of the hamiltonian . on the other hand ,",
    "the precise knowledge of the hamiltonian is often not necessary to understand the long - distance behavior of the system , in particular the universal critical properties near a second - order phase transition . in this paper , we describe an approach based on the non - perturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) which captures both local and critical fluctuations in lattice models and therefore describes universal and non - universal properties . in particular , we can calculate the critical exponents , the transition temperature and the magnetization in classical spin models .",
    "the nprg approach has been successfully applied to many areas of physics and in particular to the study of critical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "it has recently been extended to lattice models  @xcite .",
    "the strategy of the nprg is to build a family of models indexed by a momentum scale parameter @xmath2 , such that fluctuations are smoothly taken into account as @xmath2 is lowered from a microscopic scale @xmath3 down to 0 . in practice",
    ", this is achieved by adding to the hamiltonian ( or the action ) a `` regulator '' term @xmath4 , which vanishes for @xmath5 , and computing the corresponding gibbs free energy ( or effective action in the field theory terminology ) @xmath6 .",
    "the initial value @xmath7 is chosen such that in the reference system defined by the hamiltonian @xmath8 all fluctuations are effectively frozen .",
    "the determination of @xmath9 then reduces to a saddle - point ( mean - field ) calculation .",
    "the gibbs free energy @xmath10 we are eventually interested in is obtained from that of the reference system by solving a rg flow equation .",
    "the latter can not in general be solved exactly ( even numerically ) and one has to resort to some approximations",
    ". the approximate flow equation must be sufficiently accurate ( and yet tractable ) to provide a good approximation of the state of the system .    in some cases however , the mean - field solution is too far away from the actual state of the system to provide a reliable initial condition for the nprg procedure .",
    "an example is provided by the localization transition between a mott insulator and a superfluid in lattice boson systems .",
    "the two - pole structure of the local ( on - site ) propagator is crucial for the very existence of the transition .",
    "this structure is however impossible to reproduce using a rg approach starting from the mean - field ( bogoliubov ) approximation .",
    "this prevents a straightforward generalization of recent nprg studies of interacting bosons  @xcite to lattice models such as the bose - hubbard model .",
    "we therefore propose a new nprg scheme for lattice models where the reference system corresponds to the ( local ) limit of decoupled sites . as an expansion about the local limit",
    ", the lattice nprg is reminiscent of kadanoff s idea of block spins  @xcite , although the way intersite interactions are progressively introduced when lowering the momentum scale @xmath2 makes it significantly different from a real - space rg . in the long - distance limit",
    ", the lattice nprg is equivalent to the usual nprg formulation and therefore yields identical results for the critical properties .",
    "the possibility to start from a reference system which already includes short - range fluctuations has been recognized before , and was used by parola and reatto in the hierarchical reference theory of fluids  @xcite , an approach which bears many similarities with the lattice nprg .",
    "an important aspect of the lattice nprg is that it is formulated in the field theory language commonly used in the nprg approach .",
    "its relation to the standard nprg formulation is therefore obvious , and many of the approximate solutions of the flow equation satisfied by @xmath6 proposed previously also apply to the lattice case .    in sec .",
    "[ sec_lattice ] we introduce the lattice nprg for a lattice field theory .",
    "we first recall the `` standard '' nprg approach to lattice models  @xcite , and then show that the lattice nprg scheme merely results from a different initial condition while the long - distance ( small @xmath2 ) behavior of the effective action @xmath6 remains the same . as an application",
