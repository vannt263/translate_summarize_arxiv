    "it is well - known that without the coulomb interactions the effective field model of graphene monolayer is a good approximation to the original tight - binding model .",
    "this effective field model @xcite operates with the continuum dirac field living in the graphene sheet .",
    "this continuum model is used also when the coulomb interactions are switched on .",
    "we suppose that it remains a good approximation to the tight - binding model when this effective field model remains in the semi - metal phase , i.e. it does not predict the appearance of the energy gap . however , as it will be explained below , we have some doubts that this model may be applicable for the small values of the substrate dielectric permittivity , where it predicts the appearance of the fermion condensate ( see below ) .    recently , the effective field model of graphene monolayer with the coulomb interactions taken into account was investigated numerically using nonperturbative lattice methods .",
    "the application of numerical lattice methods is justified by the fact that the fermi velocity @xmath4 is about @xmath5 .",
    "that s why the effective coupling constant @xmath6 is large and the coulomb interactions are strong . therefore",
    ", nonperturbative effects may be strong . in @xcite the effective low energy field model of graphene",
    "was investigated numerically using the lattice regularized model with staggered fermions .",
    "the main output of these investigations is that there exists the phase transition at a certain value of the effective coupling constant @xmath7 .",
    "this effective coupling constant is related to the dielectric permittivity @xmath8 of substrate as follows @xcite : @xmath9 ( it is worth mentioning that due to the lattice artifacts this relation may be modified within a certain lattice realization of the effective field model of graphene . )    there is an evidence that this is the semi - metal  insulator phase transition .",
    "namely , one of the possible condensates becomes nonzero at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in addition , the indications were found that the usual longitudinal conductivity vanishes at the position of the phase transition @xcite .",
    "the possibility that the insulator phase may appear in graphene monolayer has also been discussed in another context ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the possibility that the effective low energy field model describes well the real graphene is not so obvious when the effective low energy model is in the insulator phase .",
    "our conclusions are based on the direct measurement of the two - point green function in the lattice regularized effective field model of graphene .",
    "the regularization is based on staggered fermions .",
    "we simulate the model using the same code that was used earlier by one of us during the work on the paper @xcite .",
    "this code was tested in several ways ( in particular , some previous results on the graphene monolayer @xcite were reproduced ) .",
    "we demonstrate that in the insulator phase the green function almost does not depend on energy while its dependence on the space - like momentum remains nontrivial .",
    "this means that the correlation time becomes negligible . at the same time",
    "the correlation length in physical units may remain nonzero or , even , infinite .",
    "therefore , the physical energy of the fermion excitation tends to infinity and the given field - theoretical model is not self - consistent at the corresponding values of @xmath8 and , thus , can not describe the real physics .",

    "moreover , the values of @xmath83 are negligible compared with @xmath84 for any values of the momentum @xmath42 ( where @xmath85 ) .",
    "this means that deep in the insulator phase the energy of the fermionic excitation tends to infinity .",
    "close to the position of the phase transition semi - metal ",
    "insulator we observe the intermediate behavior of the mentioned above quantities .",
    "namely , there are very small hights of the peaks of @xmath86 and @xmath87 as functions of @xmath70 .",
    "this is confirmed also by the consideration of the results for the current - current correlator as a function of imaginary time represented in @xcite ( eq . ( 16 ) ) .",
    "namely , in fig . 3 of @xcite the spectral density of this correlator is represented .",
    "it is clear from this figure that in the insulator phase at @xmath88 ( i.e. , for @xmath89 ) the only maximum of the spectral density is at the frequencies @xmath90 , where @xmath48 is the lattice spacing .",
    "for @xmath91 the values of the spectral density are much less than at @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the correlation time extracted from this correlator is of the order of the lattice spacing ( in the insulator phase ) .",
    "we consider the mentioned above results as an indication that at the sufficiently small values of the dielectric permittivity of the substrate the effective low energy field model does not correspond to the original tight - binding model .",
    "therefore , it may have nothing to do with the reality .",
    "most likely , here the discreteness of the graphene honeycomb lattice becomes important for the description of the physical phenomena and the excitations that are not described by the effective field theory play an important role .",
    "therefore the conclusion of @xcite , that there is the insulator phase of the graphene monolayer , seems to us questionable .",
    "it is worth mentioning that we measure our quantities at fixed @xmath82 while the phase transition was observed in the behavior of the quantities extrapolated to @xmath93 . in order to make definite conclusions",
    "it is necessary to repeat the calculations described in the present paper for different values of @xmath19 and to extrapolate the results to the value of @xmath19 equal to zero .",
