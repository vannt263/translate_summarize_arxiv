    "the hallmark of luttinger liquids lies in spin - charge separation ; an electron fractionalizes into a spinon carrying the spin degrees of freedom and a holon carrying the charge . detecting spin - charge separation relies on the study of the single particle spectral function . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the ground state low energy properties of the single particle spectral function can be obtained from bosonization @xcite .",
    "this approach yields two branch cuts , corresponding to the spinon and the holon , dispersing linearly from the fermi wave vector with spin and charge velocities . beyond this low energy limit ,",
    "exact calculations of the spectral function have been carried out for the infinite @xmath4 hubbard model @xcite .",
    "taking into account that in this limit the spin velocity vanishes , the results stand in agreement with the low energy bosonization picture .",
    "furthermore the calculations reveal higher energy features such as a holon shadow band .",
    "hence , distinct signatures of luttinger liquids may be found in a wide energy range thus facilitating detection in photoemission experiments . beyond the infinite @xmath4 limit",
    ", numerical simulations such as dynamical dmrg ( ddrmg ) @xcite or quantum monte carlo @xcite can be used to investigate the zero temperature properties of the spectral function . in particular ,",
    "@xmath5 ddmrg results for the hubbard model have been compared successfully with low temperature , @xmath6 , photoemission experiments on the organic one - dimensional conductor ttf - tcnq @xcite . in the temperature range @xmath7",
    "experiments point towards substantial spectral weight transfer . keeping the model parameters which reproduce the low temperature data , our aim is to understand if the experimentally observed temperature behavior of the spectral function can be reproduced by finite temperature model calculations .",

    "the spectral function is extracted from the imaginary time data by inverting the equation : @xmath26 since this inversion is numerically ill defined we have used the maximum entropy method and favored a recently proposed stochastic version @xcite .",
