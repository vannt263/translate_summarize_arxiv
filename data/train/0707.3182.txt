    "over the past 20 years we have come to learn that all strong and electroweak phenomena below the scale of a few hundred gev can be well described @xcite with high precision by renormalizable yang - mills gauge theories as encoded in the standard model ( sm ) lagrangian .",
    "of course within this realm some issues remain to be addressed , such as the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking ( which we hope to resolve from data provided by the lhc ) and the origin of the fermion family structure .",
    "similarly , the description of gravity via einstein s general relativity ( gr ) , as encoded in the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action , has been proven remarkably successful over a wide range of scales from the sub - millimeter @xcite , to interplanetary @xcite , and even cosmological distances @xcite . here ,",
    "too , some issues remain to be addressed such as the nature of the ( apparent ) dark energy / cosmological constant .",
    "the next broad question to answer is how to unify our description of gravity with those of the other three forces , , how do we construct a quantum theory of gravity .",
    "this problem is long - standing and has been the subject of much labor over the last half - century @xcite , and our perspective on possible ways to resolve this problem have evolved significantly over time .",
    "the essential issue with constructing quantum gravity in the standard approach is that the eh action leads to a quantum field theory which is not perturbatively renormalizable , unlike the case of yang - mills theories .",
    "this can be most easily seen by examining the interaction of gravitons with matter ( or their self - interactions ) in any fixed metric background .",
    "distinct from the case of yang - mills theories , where the interactions of gauge fields with matter or each other correspond to dimension-4 operators ( in 4-dimensional spacetime ) , the gravitational interactions correspond to operators of dimension-5 ( or higher ) leading to non - renormalizability by simple power counting .",
    "this implies that the theory is not well - behaved in the ultraviolet ( uv ) .",
    "in particular , this approach implies that ( 4-d ) gravity becomes strong near the reduced planck scale , @xmath4 , so that we usually treat gr as an effective theory at energies far below that scale . as we have been recently reminded @xcite , weinberg @xcite long ago pointed out that there are only four known approaches to dealing with this issue , and they have not evolved qualitatively since that time :",
    "* the eh action in 4 dimensions is incomplete ; new physics must be added that somehow tames the poor perturbative uv behavior of gr .",
    "this is the path followed by string theory ( where extra dimensions , supersymmetry , new fields and a new scale enter ) @xcite as well as in loop quantum gravity ( which also introduces a new scale ) @xcite .",
    "this approach has received the most attention in recent years and has met with a number of successes .",
    "* gravitons are not fundamental objects but are composite ; this possibility has been addressed by a number of authors @xcite . *",
    "the poor uv behavior of gr in 4-d can be controlled by a re - ordering of the conventional perturbation expansion employing a modified version of the yennie , frautschi and suura @xcite resummation techniques .",
    "this approach has recently been advocated by ward @xcite . *",
    "the poor uv behavior of gr is an artifact of perturbation theory .",
    "general relativity is non - perturbatively renormalizable having the property of being asymptotically safe due to the existence of a non - gaussian fixed point ; such an approach has also met with a number of recent successes @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a fixed point has been demonstrated in both field theoretical and in lattice studies @xcite in 4-d as well as in higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "in such an approach , the running gravitational coupling becomes weaker as the fundamental gravity scale is reached .",
    "a common feature of the last two approaches is that the strength of the gravitational interaction , usually expressed through newton s constant , @xmath5 , runs in such a way that the effective coupling actually becomes _ weaker _ in the energy regime near @xmath4",
    ". this would imply good high energy behavior and , perhaps , the restoration of unitarity in graviton scattering amplitudes .",
    "could such ideas be tested in , , collider experiments ? clearly , to do so collision energies must approach the fundamental scale of gravity , which is unattainable 4-dimensional gravity .",
    "however , the property of asymptotic safety has been demonstrated to persist in higher dimensions @xcite where we know that we can construct scenarios where the ( true ) fundamental scale of gravity is of order @xmath6 tev , such as in the models of arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali(add ) @xcite with large extra dimensions and of randall and sundrum(rs ) @xcite with warped geometries . in this paper",
    ", we will demonstrate that if either the add or rs models are realized they , will provide a framework for testing the hypothesis of asymptotic safety at the lhc and ilc through the appearance of gravitational form - factors which will damp the strength of gravity at high energies .",
    "as we will see below , such form - factors will lead to significant modifications in the traditional predictions for both of these scenarios .",
    "these deviations from the standard predictions can then be used to test the nature of the form factor and to determine if a consistent theory along such lines can be successfully constructed .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we will provide the essential background formalism for applying the approach of asymptotic safety to both the add and rs extra - dimensional models . in sections iii and",
    "iv we will examine how the traditional signals of the add and rs models , respectively , at future colliders are modified and the parameter space range over which they may be observed .",
    "a discussion and a summary of our results can be found in section v.",
    "here we present the formalism that is relevant to our analysis .",
    "a general review of non - perturbative renormalizability and asymptotic safety is clearly beyond the scope of the present work , but can be found in the introductory survey by niedermaier @xcite .",
    "we work in euclidean space within the context of an effective average action that consists of a truncated list of operators which are part of a more generalized gravitational action .",
    "the simplest choice for this fixed set of operators is the einstein - hilbert truncation .",
    "this action is simply given by the familiar expression in @xmath7-dimensions , @xmath8\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the @xmath7-dimensional planck scale , @xmath10 is the ricci scalar , @xmath11 corresponds to the cosmological constant , and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of additional spatial dimensions .",
    "newton s constant in @xmath7-dimensions can then be defined in analogy with 4-dimensional expression as @xmath14 . for convenience , we define a corresponding dimensionless quantity , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an arbitrary mass scale . our goal is to obtain the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for this dimensionless gravitational coupling and we are particularly interested in the rge behavior of @xmath17 in the ultraviolet ( uv ) . it has been found that the qualitative nature of this behavior is not very sensitive to the truncation in the gravitational theory employed above where only the eh term appears in the action @xcite .    following bonanno and reuter @xcite , the relevant rge corresponding to the action above",

    "note that this form factor ensures that the gravitational coupling is unaffected at low energies and retains the value of the fundamental planck scale , but then runs with increasing energy .",
    "the derivation of this form factor has not relied on the background metric and hence it can be equally well applied to the case of warped geometries as well as flat dimensions , provided that , for simplicity , the possibility of a running cosmological constant is neglected .    in order to quantify the effect of this form factor in the collider signatures of either the add or rs models",
    ", we need to relate the quantity @xmath16 to physical parameters in the production process ; this issue is similar to that of the apparent scale ambiguity in qcd in computations performed at finite order in perturbation theory . in reactions mediated by @xmath59-channel kinematics , which are typical of graviton exchange or resonant production processes in the add or rs models ,",
    "it is natural to take @xmath60 so that in such cases the form factor becomes @xmath61^{-1}\\,.\\ ] ] thus in the graviton exchange process in the add model , which is described by a cutoff parameter @xmath62 @xcite , the corresponding result for the cross section including the form factor can be obtained by making the replacement @xmath63\\,.\\ ] ] note that this renders the predictions for graviton exchange explicitly dependent on @xmath13 , which does not occur within this formalism in the traditional add scenario .",

    "note that for fixed @xmath62 , the effect of the form factor increases as @xmath54 ( or @xmath66 ) take on smaller values .",
    "in other processes , such as graviton emission in add , there is more ambiguity in the identification of the scale @xmath16 .",
    "here , one may choose from several different kinematic quantities such as the emitted graviton s energy or @xmath68 .",
    "this ambiguity will affect the numerical values of the cross sections in detail and we will thus present results for several different choices for this scale . however , as we will see below , our qualitative results are insensitive to this uncertainty .",
    "we now examine the effects of this form factor in the collider signatures for the add and rs models and determine whether the resulting suppression in the strength of the gravitational coupling is observable in these scenarios .",
    "in this scenario @xcite , the standard model fields are confined to a 3-brane in the higher dimensional bulk and gravity alone progrates in the additional dimensions .",

    "the basic processes that are relevant for the add scenario are virtual kk graviton exchange and the direct production of kk gravitons via graviton emission as discussed above for the lhc .",
    "we first consider the case of graviton exchange in the reaction @xmath83 . at the @xmath126 gev ilc ,",
    "the search reach for the cutoff @xmath62 in the conventional add model is approximately 5 tev @xcite , independent of the value of @xmath13 , assuming an integrated luminosity of 500 @xmath127 and @xmath128 electron beam polarization .",
    "since @xmath129 is fixed in this channel , the implementation of the form factor is straightforward and proceeds as discussed above .",
    "the modifications in the cross section as a function of @xmath129 in the presence of the form factor are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ilcexch ] , for various values of @xmath13 and the parameter @xmath54 , taking @xmath130 tev .",
    "we see that the behavior of the cross section is similar to that of the invariant mass distribution for drell - yan production at the lhc ; the effects are more pronounced at small values of @xmath54 and track the standard model result for @xmath124 .",
    "note that again the dependence on @xmath13 reverses as the threshold @xmath131 is passed . at large enough values of @xmath129 , the cross section for @xmath98 starts to turn over , displaying the onset of unitarity as discussed above .",
    "for this value of @xmath62 , a higher center - of - mass energy is clearly beneficial in order to detect the presence of the form factor .     as a function of @xmath129 with @xmath130 tev .",
    "the solid , dashed , and dotted sets of curves correspond to the parameter @xmath132 , respectively , and @xmath133 correspond to the curves in each set from top to bottom on the right - hand side .",
    "the solid black curves at the top ( bottom ) represent the conventional add ( standard model ) result for this channel.,width=264 ]    since the implementation of the form factor is straightforward , the modification to the search reach can be derived analytically .",
    "we find ( denoting the search reach with running coupling as @xmath134 ) @xmath135 which can be easily solved numerically .",
    "if the parameter @xmath136 , we find that @xmath134 does not differ from @xmath62 by more than @xmath137 for any value of @xmath13 .",
    "if , however , @xmath124 and @xmath138 there is a reasonable search reach degradation ; in particular , we find , for @xmath139 that @xmath140 tev .    the last channel for us to consider is graviton emission at the ilc , which proceeds via the reaction @xmath141 .",
    "the effect of running gravitational couplings on the missing energy cross section are shown in fig .",
    "[ ilcemit ] as a function of @xmath129 . in this figure",
    ", we take @xmath142 as the analogous choice was found to lead to the largest deviations at the lhc .",
    "we see that deviations from the conventional result are only observable for @xmath124 , which somewhat lowers the cross section at larger values of @xmath129 .",
    "since this process is typically employed as a means to determine the number of extra dimensions , the existence of a form factor would in principle interfere with this determination .     from kk graviton emission as a function of @xmath129 , taking @xmath143 .",
    "all curves are normalized to the value of the cross section at @xmath126 gev with @xmath144 tev and @xmath145 . the ( invisible ) dash - dotted , dashed , and dotted curves correspond to @xmath119 , while the blue , green , and red sets of curves represent @xmath146 .",
    "the solid curves represent the conventional add cross section.,width=264 ]    an analytical analysis can also be applied for this process since the center - of - mass energy is fixed . in the usual case ,",
    "the rate for graviton emission scales as @xmath147 and one can obtain the reach for any given value of @xmath13 in a straightforward manner @xcite .",
    "equating the signal rate that yields the search limit in the conventional add case to the rate in the presence of the form factor , yields a relation between the search reaches with and without a running gravitational coupling . denoting @xmath148 as the search reach with the form factor , we have @xmath149 where here we have chosen @xmath60 to maximize the effect of the form factor .",
    "since values of @xmath9 are in the multi - tev range , we find that @xmath150 to the high accuracy of @xmath151 or better for @xmath152 .",
    "for example , with @xmath153 the traditional reach is given by @xmath154 tev @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath124 for these cases we obtain @xmath155 tev when the form factor is present . choosing a smaller and perhaps more realistic value of @xmath16 , such as the photon energy",
    ", we see that the corresponding change in the ilc discovery reach is even further reduced .",
    "thus to a very good approximation , a running gravitational coupling is seen to have very little effect on ilc search reaches for add model signatures .",
    "in the rs model @xcite , the @xmath156 orbifolded , slice of 5-dimensional space bounded by two branes is described by a non - factorizable metric @xmath157 with @xmath158 being the flat minkowski metric .",
    "the two branes are separated by a distance @xmath159 , with one being located at @xmath160 ( known as the uv brane ) , and the other at @xmath161 ( the ir brane ) .",
    "the warp factor , @xmath162 , generates the hierarchy between the planck and electroweak scales when @xmath163 .",
    "the curvature parameter @xmath164 satisfies @xmath165 with @xmath166 @xcite .    in order to keep things simple ,",
    "we limit ourselves to the case where the sm fields are localized to the ir brane ; we can then concentrate on the gravitational sector of the theory and readily compare results with the classic rs model . in this case",
    ", the principle collider signal for the rs model is the resonant production of spin-2 kk gravitons @xcite .",
    "the kk masses are given by @xmath167 where @xmath168 are the roots of the @xmath169 bessel function , and they couple to the standard model fields with electroweak strength .",
    "since the kk gravitons are directly produced in the @xmath59-channel in this scenario , the form factor describing the running gravitational coupling can be written as @xmath170 where we have set @xmath171 .",
    "it is interesting to first consider the ratio of width to mass for the graviton kk states as @xmath172 increases . in the standard rs picture ,",
    "@xmath173 where @xmath174 is a fixed numerical factor @xmath175 . for a fixed value of @xmath176",
    "we observe that this ratio grows significantly as @xmath172 increases , and at some point the very idea of a graviton resonance is lost . on the resonance peak for a kk graviton , the form factor given above can be written as @xmath177 ^ 3\\,,\\ ] ] where the last equality follows from the relation @xmath178 .",
    "we now see that width scales as @xmath179^{-1}\\,.\\ ] ] as @xmath168 gets large we now find @xmath180 which is _ independent _ of both @xmath176 and @xmath172 .",
    "thus the form factor prevents the widths of the kk graviton states from growing too large and a well - defined resonance structure is maintained for every level in the kk tower .",
    "we also see that the parameter @xmath54 plays an important role in determining the graviton width ; however , a problem may still arise if the value of @xmath54 is too large .    to determine the range of the parameter @xmath54 that is allowed by perturbative unitarity in the rs model",
    ", we again study the @xmath1 scattering process @xmath76 at high energies .",
    "the kk tower of gravitons contribute to this process via @xmath59- , @xmath54- and @xmath181-channel exchanges . including the form factor and summing over the first 10,000 states in the graviton kk tower",
    ", we obtain the results displayed in fig .",
    "[ rsunit ] for the @xmath77 partial wave amplitude for this channel . in this figure",
    ", we show the value of @xmath182 as a function of the ratio @xmath183 ( where @xmath184 is the mass of the first graviton kk state ) for several values of @xmath54 assuming @xmath185 .",
    "it is clear that this amplitude is well - behaved and @xmath182 is always less than unity when @xmath186 .",
    "however , at very high energies , it appears that the amplitude starts to grow for @xmath187 and will eventually violate perturbative unitarity .",
    "we find that these results do not change appreciably as @xmath176 is varied .",
    "note that the presence of the form factor greatly dampens this amplitude compared to the standard rs result .",

    "we see the familiar pattern that , in the standard rs picture , the resonances get wider and wider as the level increases in the kk tower and the resonance structure is completely lost above @xmath189 depending upon the value of @xmath176 . turning on the form factor and taking smaller values of @xmath54 , we do not lose too much of the apparent signal peak , but the towers separate and become more narrow for large @xmath172 .",

    "the poor high energy behavior of general relativity observed in perturbation theory may be cured if there exists a non - gaussian fixed point rendering the theory asymptotically safe and potentially non - perturbatively renormalizable .",
    "if such a possibility is realized , the effective gravitational coupling at high energies becomes weaker and this running can be parameterized through the introduction of a form factor when calculating the interactions of gravitons with matter or each other .",
    "these form factors can also modify graviton exchange amplitudes rendering them unitary at tree - level .",
    "the evidence that such a situation may be realized in nature is reasonably strong and has improved theoretically in recent years .",
    "however , since the effect of the form factor is only significant once the relevant energies approach the fundamental scale of gravity , in 4-dimensions it will be difficult to test this possibility directly anytime in the near future .",
    "extra - dimensional scenarios of the add or rs type allow for the fundamental scale to be not far above @xmath198 tev .",
    "if such scenarios are realized , the existence of gravitational form factors can then be probed at future colliders such as the lhc and/or the ilc . in this paper",
    "we have shown that this is indeed the case for both these scenarios .",
    "the analysis of reuter  and of litim @xcite suggests a very specific structure for this form factor which is totally determined in d - dimensions up to an order one coefficient , @xmath54 .",
    "we find that imposing tree - level unitarity requirements on graviton exchange amplitudes in either the add or rs models implies that the range of @xmath54 is restricted : @xmath195 . in both of these models ,",
    "graviton exchange processes were shown to be particularly sensitive to the presence of these form factors .",
    "in particular , we demonstrated that measurements at both the lhc and ilc can be used to extract the value of @xmath54 . in the rs model",
    ", the width of graviton resonances , which ordinarily increases at higher levels of the kk tower , was shown to asymptote to a constant value when form factors are employed .",
    "on the otherhand , the process of graviton emission which occurs in the add scenario , was shown to be rather insensitive to the presence of form factors .",
    "interestingly , the collider search reaches for extra dimension was also shown to not be overly sensitive to form factor contributions in both the add and rs cases .",
    "if these extra dimensional scenarios are realized in nature , then hopefully the observation of form factor effects will be observed , thus providing us with an important handle on the underlying theory of quantum gravity .",

    "<S> recent studies have shown that the poor perturbative behavior of general relativity in the ultraviolet regime may be ameliorated by the existence of a non - gaussian fixed point which renders the theory asymptotically safe and possibly non - perturbatively renormalizable . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a running of the ( effective ) gravitational coupling such that gravity becomes weaker at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> we parameterize this effective coupling with a form factor and study its consequences at the lhc and ilc in models with large extra dimensions or warped extra dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we find significant effects in the processes of kaluza - klein ( kk ) graviton exchange or resonant kk graviton production in both the drell - yan reaction as well as in @xmath0 . on the otherhand , </S>",
    "<S> processes leading to kk graviton emission show qualitatively less sensitivity to the presence of a form factor . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we examine tree - level perturbative unitarity in @xmath1 gravity - mediated scattering and find that this form factor produces a far better behaved amplitude at large center of mass energies .    </S>",
