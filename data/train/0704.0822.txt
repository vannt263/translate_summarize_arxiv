    "symmetry is one of the most important notions in quantum field theory . in many examples , it is useful in investigating properties of quantum field theories non - perturbatively , is a guiding principle in constructing field theories for various purposes such as grand unification , or gives powerful methods in finding exact solutions .",
    "it also plays important roles in actual renormalization procedures",
    ". therefore it should be interesting to study symmetries also in noncommutative field theories @xcite , which may result from some quantum gravity effects @xcite .",
    "a difficulty in the study in this direction is the apparent violation of basic symmetries such as poincar symmetry in the noncommutativity of spacetime .",
    "for example , the moyal plane @xmath1=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu}$ ] is translational invariant , but is not lorentz or rotational invariant .",
    "another example is the three - dimensional spacetime with noncommutativity @xmath2=i\\kappa \\epsilon^{ijk}x_k\\ ( i , j , k=1,2,3)$ ] @xcite with a noncommutativity parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this noncommutative spacetime is lorentz - invariant , but is not invariant under the translational transformation @xmath3 with @xmath4-number @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , a naive construction of noncommutative quantum field theory on this spacetime leads to rather disastrous violations of energy - momentum conservation @xcite : the violations coming from the non - planar diagrams do not vanish in the commutative limit @xmath6 as in the uv / ir mixing phenomena @xcite .    in recent years , however , there has been interesting conceptual progress in understanding symmetries in noncommutative field theories : the symmetry transformations in noncommutative spacetime are not the usual lie - algebraic type , but should be generalized to have hopf algebraic structures .",
    "the moyal plane was pointed out to be invariant under the twisted poincar transformation in @xcite and under the twisted diffeomorphism in @xcite .",
    "there have been various proposals to implement the twisted poincar invariance in quantum field theories @xcite . as for the noncommutative spacetime with @xmath2=i\\kappa \\epsilon^{ijk}x_k$ ] , a noncommutative quantum field theory was derived as the effective field theory of three - dimensional quantum gravity with matters @xcite .",
    "its essential difference from the naive construction mentioned above is the nontrivial braiding for each crossing in non - planar feynman diagrams . with this braiding , there exists a kind of conserved energy - momentum in the amplitudes , and the energy - momentum operators have hopf algebraic structures .",
    "our aim of this paper is to systematically understand these hopf algebraic symmetries and their consequences in noncommutative field theories in the framework of braided quantum field theories proposed by oeckl @xcite . in the usual quantum field theories ,",
    "symmetries give non - perturbative relations among correlation functions .",
    "we will see that such relations have natural extensions to the hopf algebraic symmetries in braided quantum field theories , and will obtain the four conditions for the relations to hold .",
    "these conditions should be interpreted as the criteria of the symmetries in braided quantum field theories .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section , we review braided quantum field theory .",
    "this review part follows faithfully the original paper @xcite , but figures are more extensively used in the proofs and the explanations to make this paper self - contained and intuitively understandable .",
    "we start with braided category and braided hopf algebra .",

    "are given .",
    "in section [ sec : sym ] , we first review the axioms of _ _ action__. ] of an algebra on vector spaces .",
    "then we consider the relations among correlation functions in braided quantum field theory .",
    "we find that four algebraic conditions are required for the relations to hold .",
    "then , as concrete examples , we discuss whether the noncommutative field theories mentioned above have the poincar symmetry by checking the four conditions . in the former case , we find that the twisted poincar symmetry is implemented only after the introduction of a non - trivial braiding factor , which agrees with the previous proposal in @xcite . in the latter case , we find that the theory has a kind of translational symmetry , which is different from the usual one by multi - field contributions .",
    "we also give some examples of such relations among correlation functions and the implications .",

    "this is the same relation as that in a lorentz invariant quantum field theory . in the case of the three point function",
    ", the relation is given by @xmath206 in general , the relation among correlation functions has the from , @xmath207 in the coordinate representation .",
    "the leading terms corresponds to the usual lorentz transformation @xmath208 .",
    "the above symmetry relations on moyal plane can be represented in similar manners as the usual commutative cases , if we use star products . in the papers @xcite ,",
    "they have pointed out that in coordinate representation , correlation functions on moyal plane should be defined with star products extended to non - coincident points ( see also @xcite ) instead of usual products since the usual commutative commutation relation @xmath209=0 ~(i , j=1 , \\cdots , n)$ ] is not invariant under the twisted poincar transformation . carrying out fourier transformation of the symmetry relation ( [ eq : generalmmunu ] ) in momentum representation to such a noncommutative coordinate representation",
    ", we obtain the symmetry relations in star tensor products .",
    "namely ( [ eq:2pointxrep ] ) becomes @xmath210 and ( [ eq:3pointxrep ] ) becomes @xmath211        to study more the meaning of these additional terms , let us see closer the transformation properties of the star products .",
    "in the latter case , it is known that the @xmath216 dependence of the twisted lorentz transformation ( [ eq : transcoprotheta ] ) comes from the lorentz transformation of @xmath216 itself @xcite . to see this ,",
    "let us consider an infinitesimal lorentz transformation , @xmath217 .",
    "the transformation of @xmath216 is given by @xmath218 if one considers not only the transformation of the coordinates , @xmath219 , but also ( [ eq : thetatrans ] ) , and assumes that @xmath220 and @xmath221 be equal , one obtains , after the fourier transformation , @xmath222 which agrees with ( [ eq : transcoprotheta ] ) .",
    "this shows that the additional part of the coproduct of @xmath223 takes into account the transformation of the non - dynamical background parameter @xmath216 .",
    "the former case can be discussed in a similar manner .",
    "the definition of the star product is given by @xmath224 where we have explicitly indicated the coordinate where the star product is taken .",
    "then we recognize that @xmath225 and @xmath226 give distinct values .",
    "namely , if the coordinate of the star product is also shifted , @xmath227 but , if not , @xmath228 therefore , if we take the translational transformation as ( [ eq : starshift ] ) , and carry out the same procedure in deriving ( [ eq : noncommutativity ] ) , we always obtain a translational invariant commutation relation , @xmath229_{\\star_{x+\\epsilon}}=2i\\kappa \\epsilon^{ijk}(x+\\epsilon)_k.\\ ] ] now , assuming that @xmath230 and @xmath231 be equal under the translation @xmath232 , we obtain , after the fourier transformation , @xmath233 which is the same as ( [ eq : piaction ] ) .    from these two examples ,",
    "we anticipate that the multi - field contributions in ( [ eq : wtidgeneral ] ) comes from the transformation properties of the star products .",
    "we have discussed symmetries in noncommutative field theories in the framework of braided quantum field theory . we have obtained the algebraic conditions for a hopf algebra to be a symmetry of a braided quantum field theory , by discussing the conditions for the relations among correlation functions generated from the transformation algebra to hold .",
    "then we have applied our discussions to the poincar symmetries in the effective noncommutative field theory of three - dimensional quantum gravity coupled with spinless particles and in the noncommutative field theory on moyal plane . in the former case",
    "we can understand the braiding between fields , which was derived from the three - dimensional quantum gravity computation , from the viewpoint of the translational symmetry of the noncommutative field theory on a lie - algebraic noncommutative spacetime . in the latter case we have found that the twisted lorentz symmetry on moyal plane is a symmetry of the quantum field theory only after the inclusion of the nontrivial braiding factor , which is in agreement with the previous proposal @xcite .",
    "then we have discussed the meaning of the hopf algebra symmetries from the viewpoint of coordinate representation .    in the recent research a noncommutative field theory on @xmath0-minkowski spacetime is discussed @xcite . since this noncommutativity of the coordinates is given by @xmath7=\\frac{i}{\\kappa}x^j$ ] , this noncommutative field theory will not have the naive translational symmetry .",
    "we may introduce a non - trivial braiding between fields as in the effective field theory discussed in section [ subsec:3dgravity ] to keep the momentum conservation .",
    "however , while the effective field theory has the braided category structure because of the invariance of the haar measure @xmath150 , the measure of the momentum space of the field theory on @xmath0-minkowski spacetime is only left - invariant @xcite .",
    "therefore it is not clear to us whether we can embed this field theory on @xmath0-minkowski spacetime into the framework of braided quantum field theory .",
    "we would like to thank s.  terashima and s.  sasaki for useful discussions and comments , and would also like to thank l.  freidel for stimulating discussions and explaining their recent results during his stay in yukawa institute for theoretical physics after the 21st nishinomiya - yukawa memorial symposium .",

    "we give the proofs of the formula ( [ eq : blr1 ] ) , ( [ eq : blr2 ] ) using diagrams .",
    "at first we use the formula @xmath234 where @xmath235 .",
    "this is clear from the definition of @xmath236 .",
    "figure [ fig : proofofblr ] gives the proof of ( [ eq : blr1 ] ) .",
    "in the first line , we use the axiom ( [ eq : coproaxm ] ) , and in the second line we use the lemma ( [ eq : lemma ] ) . we find the last line from the property of counit .",
    "next we prove ( [ eq : blr2 ] ) . by using the braided leibniz rule ( [ eq : blr1 ] ) as @xmath237 ,",
    "the left - hand side of ( [ eq : blr2 ] ) becomes figure [ fig : blr21 ] .",

    "for example , if the degree of @xmath20 is 3 , the second term of figure [ fig : blr21 ] can be reduced as in figure [ fig : blr22 ] .",
    "we have used @xmath240 in the second line of figure [ fig : blr22 ] .",
