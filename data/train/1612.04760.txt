    "exploring and improving the new calculation possibilities , simulation techniques and the extension of numerous models in connection with the dynamic properties of nonideal plasma is in the focus of investigators nowadays .    for further investigation of strongly correlated plasma physics and investigations of its electronic properties",
    "remains an ongoing problem .",
    "for an example theoretical calculations and measurements of reflectivity are important because of its possible use as diagnostic tool in the physics of high - density energy ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the aims of this work is determination of high frequency ( hf ) characteristics of non - ideal plasmas . here ,",
    "all the presented values , like the electrical permeability and the coefficients of refractivity and reflectivity , as well as em field penetration depth , are yielded by the help of the numerically calculated values for the dense plasma dynamic conductivity in an external hf electric field .",
    "the determination of the dynamic conductivity of a completely ionized plasma in a hf external electric field , as well as yielding of other plasma parameters relies on the method presented in @xcite .",
    "the method itself is based on the self - consistent field theory developed in @xcite for the static plasma transport coefficients calculation , such as static plasma electric conductivity , etc .",
    "after the experimentally proven validity of the presented theory in the investigated domain of the electron densities and temperatures , the method was tested in the domain of more dense , non - ideal plasma i.e. was applied for calculation of conductivity of db white dwarf atmospheres ( see @xcite ) in wide area of electron densities and temperatures .",
    "the main aims of this work is determination of hf characteristics of non - ideal plasmas as well as to introduce usable form of the presentation of calculated data ( fitting formula ) important for laboratory applications and astrophysics modeling .",
    "all the data presented here very soon can bee access through http://servo.aob.rs as web service and database .",

    "@xmath16 is the static relaxation time and the method of determination of @xmath16 is described in the previous papers @xcite , @xcite in detail .",
    "other hf plasma characteristics can be expressed in terms of the quantities @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in this way the plasma dielectric permeability is shown as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the coefficients of refraction @xmath22 , and reflection @xmath23 , are determined as    @xmath24    where , bearing in mind that @xmath25 the real and imaginary pert of refractivity are given by relations @xmath26 and @xmath27 . from here",
    "the equation for the plasma reflectivity could be expressed as + @xmath28 ^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "in such a way , we determined the other parameter of interest i.e. the penetration depth of electromagnetic radiation into plasma , @xmath29 .",
    "this quantity is the skin - layer width determined as the inverse imaginary part of the electromagnetic field wave number @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the speed of light and @xmath32 is defined above in the text .    here , it is common to use an dimensionless coupling parameter , the plasma non - ideality coefficient @xmath33 , that characterizes the physical properties of the plasma .",
    "it is of especial importance in describing of dense , non - ideal plasmas , as ones considered in this paper .",
    "the mentioned parameter @xmath34 as such characterizes the potential energy of interaction at average distance between particles @xmath35 in comparison with the thermal energy .",
    "the well - known brueckner density parameter @xmath36 is the ratio of wigner - seitz and bohr radius .",
    "in order of continuation of previous investigation , that is of interest for db white dwarf atmospheres ( see @xcite ) , the calculations of the hf characteristics of plasma in wide area of electron densities and temperatures is conducted .",
    "the investigated areas are of interest for the both laboratory experiments and atmospheres of different stellar types .",
    "the electrical permeability and the coefficients of refractivity and reflectivity of dense non - ideal plasmas are determined on the basis of numerically calculated values for the dense plasma dynamic conductivity in an external hf electric field .",
    "here are considered electronic number density and temperature in the ranges of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the examined range of frequencies @xmath39 covers the region @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the plasma frequency .",
    "it is observed that , within the considered ranges of variation of electron density and temperature , the behavior character of the hf plasma quantities with the increase of the @xmath42 and @xmath13 is as it is expected .",
    "this means that the behavior of those characteristics , with the increasing of @xmath42 and @xmath13 , remains the same within the whole range of electron number densities and temperatures @xmath43 .",
    "the same conclusion is also related to all yielded parameters , including the penetration depth @xmath29 .    from the results",
    "it could be observed that for the long - wavelength radiation , i.e. frequency tends to zero , there is interesting dependence on temperature and frequency of skin - effect @xmath44 at surface plot in fig.[fig : d2324 ] .",
    "also , the reflectivity coefficient tends to 1 , mining the plasma layer acts as a mirror ( see e.g fig .  [",
    "fig : r2324 ] ) .",
    "particularly , here we give special attention to analysis of reflectivity data because this quantity is very important in high energy density plasmas ( @xmath45 measurements as an important diagnostic tool provide information about the density profile ) .    in fig.[fig : dev ] we compare the behavior of reflectivity coefficient @xmath45 , determined in this paper , with the behavior of the corresponding quantities calculated in @xcite for @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 @xmath49 and also for @xmath48 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 . here",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath33 are above defined brueckner density and non - ideality parameters respectively .",
    "the corresponding curves showing theoretical data from @xcite are presented by full , dashed and dotted lines .",
    "fig.[fig : dev ] shows a qualitative agreement ( the differences are less or close to 10 - 25 percents ) of our results with the results of @xcite in the whole region of @xmath39 and for all values of and non - ideality parameters . by analyzing the behavior of corresponding curves in fig s [ fig : r2324 ] and [ fig : dev ] one can see the tendency that increase in the density and coupling parameters leads to a decrease in the reflection index .",
    "then , in fig.[fig : dev ] it is seen that at frequencies @xmath54 the reflection occurs most effectively and at @xmath55 the plasma becomes much more transparent .             in fig .",
    "[ fig : rr ] is presented a surface plot of the plasma reflectivity for different values of density as a function of temperature and frequency . with this figure",
    "it is possible to map the region of high non - ideality . for a given density",
    "it can be selected the appropriate panel from fig .",
    "[ fig : rr ] and find the value of @xmath45 for the chosen pair of temperature and frequency .",
    "in order to more simplify the presented results for the further use a fitting procedure is exploited to get the plasma reflectivity from the temperature and frequency for various values of electron density .",
    "for all analyzed densities the expression is given by @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and _ a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h , i , j _ are calculated parameters .",
    "these parameters were computed from a standard 3d fitting procedure , ( best - fit value i.e. r - square close to one ) and their values as the function of density are shown in tab.[tab : param ] .",
    "we must emphasize that these expressions gives good results for values of frequencies in the region @xmath59 although they can be applied with caution beyond this region .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         * some hf quantities : * the behavior of some hf quantities for various plasma conditions are illustrated here although it is not the main topic of our research .",
    "the reason of its representation is that it enables determination of other transport properties .",
    "the electrical permeability and the coefficients of refractivity of dense non - ideal plasmas are determined on the basis of numerically calculated values for the dense plasma dynamic conductivity in an external hf electric field .",
    "here we will present the most extreme cases which we think are the most interesting for readers ( all other data covering the ranges of @xmath37 and @xmath60 will be presented in database ) .    on figure [ fig : n24 ] the real and imaginary part of refraction coefficient for density @xmath61 in temperature region @xmath62",
    "is presented as function of frequencies @xmath39 . from this figure",
    "one can see that the behaviour of this hf quantity is similar to the investigated ones in upper material .",
    "further analysing the presented results it could be observed that for the long - wavelength radiation , i.e. frequency tends to zero , even for most extreme cases the imaginary part of the dielectric function diverges , i.e. , @xmath63 is much greater than real part of the dielectric function ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eps ] ) .    *",
    "astrophysical relevance : * as we noted in above text the investigations of hf characteristics is a important for research of atmosphere plasmas of astrophysical objects like white dwarfs with different atmospheric compositions ( da , dc etc . ) , and some other stars ( m - type red dwarfs , sun etc ) . in order to demonstrate this astrophysical relevance fig.[fig : sig0 ]",
    "is presented here . in fig .",

    "in this paper we calculated the hf characteristics of plasmas of increased non - ideality as a functions of external electrical field frequencies .",
    "the presented data covers vide region of electron densities and temperatures .",
