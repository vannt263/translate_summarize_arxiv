    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0pt ) is an effective field theory approximation to qcd which allows for a description of low - energy hadronic properties in terms of a systematic expansion in momenta , energies and quark masses  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0pt is by now a well developed field , such that many quantites , e.g. meson masses , decay constants and vacuum expectation values , are known up to nnlo , or @xmath1 .",
    "as @xmath0pt is a non - renormalizable theory , an increasing , but certainly not overwhelming , number of low - energy constants ( lec : s ) appears at each order in the calculations .",
    "these lec : s are not determined by chiral symmetry , but are in principle calculable from full qcd . in addition , some of the lec : s can also be fixed by fitting @xmath0pt expressions to experimental data .    at the present time , however , the only known way of deriving quantitative information on the low - energy properties of qcd from first principles is by means of lattice qcd simulations , where qcd is solved by numerical monte carlo techniques on a discretized space - time lattice . ideally , one would then use @xmath0pt to extract information on the lec : s of qcd , as well as for the extrapolation of lattice qcd results to the continuum limit .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath0pt is insufficient for this purpose as lattice qcd simulations have , for reasons of computational efficiency , to be performed in the so - called partially quenched approximation ( pqqcd ) , where the masses of the sea quarks are different from and typically much larger than the valence quark masses .",
    "however , much progress is being made and at present , simulations are practicable for light sea quark masses of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the strange quark mass . nevertheless , this is still quite far from the physical light quark masses of @xmath4 .",
    "partially quenched @xmath0pt ( pq@xmath0pt ) is the extension of @xmath0pt to the case of unequal valence and sea quark masses  @xcite , and provides a way of making contact with present lattice qcd simulations if the sea quark masses are small enough so that the chiral expansion is applicable .",
    "the possiblity of producing lattice qcd data for different values of the sea and valence quark masses also allows for the investigation of a more comprehensive set of lec : s . in pq@xmath0pt ,",
    "disconnected valence quark loops are eliminated by introduction of bosonic ghost quarks .",
    "pq@xmath0pt at nlo as well as the treatment of the super - singlet @xmath5 has been discussed in great detail in  @xcite .",
    "since qcd may be obtained as a continuous limit of pqqcd , the lec : s of pqqcd with @xmath6 sea quarks should , in general , be expected to be the same as for ( unquenched ) @xmath6 flavor qcd .",
    "a slight complication is introduced by the cayley - hamilton relations which are used to decrease the number of independent lec : s in the unquenched case , since these no longer hold for partially quenched theories .",
    "nevertheless , the lec : s of unquenched qcd may be expressed as linear combinations of the pqqcd ones , so that a set of values for the partially quenched lec : s may be directly translated into the physical ones .",
    "the expressions obtained at nnlo in pq@xmath0pt are extremely long compared to the ones in unquenched @xmath0pt , even though the basic feynman diagrams are similar .",
    "the nnlo feynman diagrams for the calculation of the decay constants of the pseudoscalar mesons are shown in fig .",
    "[ feynfig ] .",
    "one source of added complexity is the appearance of many more possible combinations of quark masses in the calculations , but most importantly , the meson propagators in the neutral sector of pq@xmath0pt contain both single and double poles , the residues of which consist of complicated rational functions of the sea and valence quark masses .",
    "fortunately , these residues satisfy a multitude of nontrivial relations which can , although at great effort , be used to compress the end results by significantly more than an order of magnitude , thereby bringing them to a publishable form .",
    "the masses and decay constants at nnlo in pq@xmath0pt depend on a number of as yet largely unknown lec : s @xmath8 from the @xmath1 counterterms . as expected from earlier work at two loops in @xmath0pt ,",
    "the contributions from the chiral logarithms are very large at nnlo , but are significantly moderated when realistic values of the @xmath9 are used .",
    "numerical results up to nnlo for masses and decay constants for @xmath10 , with all @xmath8 set to zero , are shown in fig .  [ plotfig ] .",
    "the quantities plotted are @xmath11 for the decay constant , and @xmath12 for the mass , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the lowest order pq@xmath0pt results .",
    "pq@xmath0pt at nnlo , for the pseudoscalar meson decay constant ( @xmath15 ) and mass ( @xmath16 ) , as a function of the valence ( @xmath17 ) and sea quark ( @xmath18 ) masses defined through @xmath19 , for the set of lec : s called fit 10 in ref .",
