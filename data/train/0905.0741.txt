    "studies of atmospheric optical turbulence have progressed significantly in the last decade .",
    "this was stimulated by new programs of site testing for extra - large telescopes .",
    "it was also realized that the potential of existing observatories may be further enhanced by the use of adaptive optics ( ao ) systems .",
    "it is well known that knowledge of only the integral turbulence on the line of sight is not enough for correct prediction of ao efficiency at a given site .",

    "it is worth noting that the discussion of this issue in the 197080th was mainly related to the selection of optimal height of telescope towers .",

    "first estimates of the contribution of free atmosphere to seeing were made by @xcite based on stellar scintillation analysis .",
    "it turned out that this contribution was quite significant , about 30% .",

    "maidanak during 23 years , completed in 2007 . here",
    "we report its main results .",
    "the measurement of the altitude distribution optical turbulence is based on the fact that amplitude of stellar scintillation produced by a turbulent layer depends on its height in a different way when observed through different apertures .    as well described in @xcite , stellar scintillation",
    "is produced by phase fluctuations of a light wave passing through optically turbulent layers of atmosphere , and subsequent propagation .",
    "the strength and spatial spectrum of amplitude fluctuations produced by the atmosphere depend on the propagation length .",
    "scintillation is quantified by the scintillation index @xmath5 representing the relative variance of flux in some aperture .",
    "tokovinin ( @xcite ) generalizes this concept to the case of simultaneous measurement of fluxes in two different apertures .",
    "the two kinds of scintillation indices  so called `` normal '' and differential  can be directly measured . on the other hand ,",
    "these indices equal integrals of the turbulence distribution along the line of sight with some weighting functions .",
    "the weights are computed from the known aperture sizes and spectral energy distribution of the light .",
    "it should be noted that the validity of the small - perturbations method and of the kolmogorov turbulence spectrum is essential here . in typical conditions of astronomical observations ,",
    "both these assumptions are usually valid .",
    "further development of this method is described in papers by kornilov et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and tokovinin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , where specific algorithms of restoration of turbulence along the line of sight are presented and various instrumental factors are accounted for . as dedicated studies show @xcite , the precision of turbulence strength representation by a set of six altitude layers is definitely better than 10% .",

    "any 5- to 6-inch telescope of about 3 m focal distance and without central obscuration may be used as a feeding optics .",
    "a natural drawback of the mass method is its insensitivity to turbulence near the ground . in order to include it for accessing complete turbulence integral along the line of sight ( giving the seeing measure )",
    ", one has to use some other method , for example differential image motion monitor ( dimm , * ? ? ?",
    "it is worth recalling here that _ image quality ( seeing ) _ is defined as a full - width at half - maximum of a long - exposure stellar image created by a large aberration - free telescope .",

    "maidanak was studied with help of so - called _ original _ mass device of first generation which was designed and built in 20012002 in the sternberg astronomical institute in collaboration with the cerro tololo and european southern observatories .",
    "the observations with the mass were made from august 2005 to november 2007 .",
    "the device was attached to the photographic refractor telescope afr-2 of 23  cm aperture and f / no 10 .",
    "valid data are only obtained after a proper adjustment of the fabry lens which sets the sizes of effective work apertures projected onto the telescope entrance aperture plane @xcite . the respective magnification factor equal to 15.4",
    "was measured after installation and was confirmed by repetitive measurements in 2006 .",
    "the physical sizes of the mass segmentator and the effective apertures of respective channels are given in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "one can see that aperture size for the channel  a is smaller than a typical fresnel radius @xmath10 = 3  7  cm depending on turbulence height while the d - channel aperture is larger which is a must for successful application of profiles restoration algorithms .",
    "the weighting functions converting the turbulence distribution along the line of sight into scintillation indices depend on spectrum of light .",
    "correct account of this factor is implemented using typical energy distributions in spectra of program stars and carefully the measured response curve of the device .",
    "while the device itself is well studied in a laboratory , the refractor lens introduces significant absorption in the blue and hence strongly violates the actual response .",
    "correction of this effect was made using photometric measurements of some 50 stars taken 15 and 16 october 2006 .    using the obtained atmospheric extinction coefficient ( @xmath11 in the mass bandpass ) , the colour equation @xmath12 vs @xmath13",

    "non - poissonity measurements involve the control light source which is built into the device @xcite .",

    "the turbulence evolved from the evening time gradually declining in altitude .",
    "the end of night is dominated by the turbulence at 4  km .    during the campaign the maidanak observatory differential image motion monitor ( dimm )",
    "was mainly used in other sites of uzbekistan .",
    "simultaneous measurements with both devices were made in 2005 from 17 of september to 5 of november ( 18 nights ) , in 2006  from 11 of february to 31 of may ( 24 nights ) and continuously during 24 nights from 25 of august to 16 of september of 2007 .",
    "the results of mass and dimm data inter - comparison will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "the mass device is working under the _ turbina _ program control @xcite which operates under linux os .",
    "although the functionality of this program includes not only the measurement control but also the real - time data processing spanning from scintillation indices calculation to the restoration of a current altitude turbulence profile , the repetitive off - line data reprocessing allows one to obtain more reliable and homogeneous results .",
    "this improvement is related to temporal drifts of the device parameters over 2  3 year period and , more importantly , to the continuous software update throughout the campaign time .",
    "such a reprocessing was performed with help of a special version of an _ atmos _ program which is part of _ turbina _ software , and a set of _",
    "shell_-scripts which filter out the input data glitches and invalid output .",
    "although observations were performed with data accumulation time for a single profile restoration equal to 20  s due to imperfect tracking of afr-2 , the data reprocessing has regrouped the input into commonly accepted 1  min accumulation time .    as an outcome , more than 50 thousand integral atmosphere parameters sets and altitude profiles were computed .",
    "each profile is quantified by turbulence intensities of six layers which are centered at 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 and 16  km .",
    "it should be stressed that provided values are not @xmath19 but the integrated ones : @xmath20 .",
    "hence the input of each layer into the image quality @xmath21 is defined by the following relation : @xmath22 for wavelength @xmath23  nm .",
    "the seeing of @xmath24 corresponds to the integral turbulence strength @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is produced by @xmath27 .    in fig .",

    "one can see that these distributions are statistically indistinguishable .",

    "interestingly , the formal median value precision for such a voluminous data set is only 0.01 .",
    "such an estimate of uncertainty is not adequate due to non - stationary nature of the considered phenomenon .",
    "the characteristic variation of a median seeing is illustrated by five seasonal medians .",
    "isoplanatic angle @xmath30 is involved to characterize a correlation of wavefront distortions in different directions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is computed from scintillation data as an integral parameter .",

    "[ fig : cumm2 ] where the overall data distribution is accompanied by seasonal ones .",

    "maximal median value was observed in autumn 2007  @xmath1 . as a reference it is worth to note the gsm estimate of 1998  1999 @xcite equal to @xmath34 while kornilov and tokovinin ( @xcite ) measured isoplanatic angle within @xmath35 to @xmath36 range .    in practice ,",
    "the most interesting is a @xmath30 value in weak turbulence conditions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumm2 ] the @xmath30 distribution is shown for that half of measurements when seeing is less than median : @xmath37 .",
    "the median of such a scope of @xmath30 is @xmath38 .",
    "it is natural that @xmath30 is vastly determined by the upper atmosphere turbulence . in this respect",
    "its value should be typical for majority of sites located at 2.5  km elevation above the sea level @xcite .",
    "equally important for adaptive optics performance , apart from isoplanatic angle , is an atmospheric time constant ( widely also called a coherence time ) @xmath39 which is another by - product of scintillation measurement @xcite .",
    "the dedicated study showsatokovin / profiler / timeconst.pdf , 2006 . ] that the time constant from mass estimation is systematically ( factor of @xmath40 ) lower than observed by other methods .",
    "meanwhile we present uncorrected values hereafter .",
    "median of @xmath39 distribution shown in fig.[fig : cumm3 ] equals to 3.94  ms for the total campaign and 2.82  ms and 4.44  ms for springs and autumns , respectively . when restricted to @xmath37 conditions one obtains a 5.41  ms median .",
    "if we apply an empiric correction mentioned above , we come to the time constant about 7  ms in good conditions .",
    "the latter coincides with the median time constant at antarctic plateau dome  c obtained with mass device in 2004 @xcite .",
    "one can recall the @xmath41  ms estimate of ehgamberdiev et al ( @xcite ) derived during the international astroclimate campaign of 1998 at maidanak .",
    "meanwhile , this value was based on a relatively short - term scope of measurements .",
    "in order to study the role of different atmosphere layers , we build the dependence of the relative layers intensity @xmath42 on the total turbulence strength @xmath43 according to mass measurements ( i.e. excluding the ground layer ) .",
    "these ratios are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : frac ] being averaged over 400 profiles .",
    "the layer input behavior differs strongly for the boundary layer ( 0.5  1  km ) and the upper atmosphere ( 8  16  km ) .",
    "the former shows its input nearly proportional to the total power while the role of the upper atmosphere diminishes with the total growth of turbulence .",
    "most representative here is the 16  km layer for which the relation is practically inversely proportional .",
    "this means that its intensity is almost invariable and absolutely insensitive to processes in the boundary layer .",
    "similar phenomenon is noticed by tokovinin and travouillon ( @xcite ) and in a paper by thomas - osip et al ( @xcite ) .    on the opposite ,",
    "the boundary turbulence is responsible for image degradation at maidanak . keeping in mind the values @xmath44 equivalent to @xmath45 seeing , we are mostly interested in the graph beginnings up to values @xmath46 . at the 2  km height",
    "the turbulence intensity is seemingly lower than at other altitudes .    as a support for this fact of a key role of the boundary layer , we present the fig .  [",
    "fig : power ] where the cumulative distributions of layers intensities are shown for a good seeing data subset ( image quality better than median ) .",
    "the prominent feature is a nearly absent lower ( 1 and 2  km ) turbulence for 50% of cases .",
    "the median of intensity in 4- and 8  km layers is @xmath47 which is slightly more than the median value for the lowest 0.5  km layer ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "it is natural to think that at 0.5  km we see the development of the turbulence generated by a ground relief .",
    "the special case here is again the upper atmosphere at 16  km .",
    "the steep rise of the cumulative distribution tells about nearly constant turbulence which is quite significant . in half a time",
    "its intensity is in a narrow span of @xmath49 .",
    "note that the high altitude turbulence is restored with a minimal error from the scintillation data .",
    "an estimation of a total turbulence power from dimm measurements @xcite allows us to evaluate the dominating input of the ground turbulence ( up to 500  m above surface ) to be 65% on average and the first 200  300  m above surface give already about 50% contribution .",
    "the same contribution is found at cerro pachon by tokovinin and travouillon ( @xcite ) .    in cases of exceptionally good images ( 25% quantile )",
    "the full image quality from dimm measurements in 1996 to 1999 @xcite constitutes @xmath50 . comparing with data in fig .",
    "[ fig : cumm1 ] we come to the ground layer contribution of 60% in these conditions while the whole boundary layer inputs more than 70% leaving less than one third of a power to the rest of atmosphere .    in such a situation the development of an adaptive optics system working in the visible should be directed to correction of the low turbulence .",
    "it is hardly possible to achieve the strehl ratio improvement factor more than 5 here , meanwhile the large corrected ao field of view ( of the order of several arc - minutes , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will be a reasonable compensation .",
    "it is worth to note here that the maximum gain for the median maidanak conditions ( fried radius @xmath51 at wavelength 500  nm ) at the 1.5  m telescope azt-22 computed according to roddier formula ( @xcite ) for optimal atmospheric distortions correction is equal to 32 .",
    "a profiting advantage of maidanak observatory is a large time constant value @xmath52 .",
    "this lowers the critical demand of a system response time by a factor of nearly 2.5 and thus makes about three times more stars available for wavefront referencing compared to cerro tololo and cerro pachon observatories @xcite .",
    "such a good @xmath39 also favours the development of optical interferometry at this site .",
