    "lead - based complex perovskite relaxor ferroelectrics , such as the mixed compound ( 1-@xmath3)pb(zn@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2-@xmath3pbtio@xmath2 ( pzn-@xmath3pt ) and ( 1-@xmath3)pb(mg@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2-@xmath3pbtio@xmath2 ( pmn-@xmath3pt ) , have recently attracted a great deal of attention because of their exceptional piezoelectric and dielectric properties .",
    "particularly important are the compositions near the morphotropic phase boundary ( mpb ) , where these properties are further enhanced .",
    "the high values of the piezoelectric and electrostrictive coefficients of pzn-@xmath3pt and pmn-@xmath3pt crystals of the compositions near the mpb , when measured in the proper orientations , are an order of magnitude greater than those of pbzr@xmath6ti@xmath7o@xmath2 ( pzt ) ceramics  @xcite . as a result , pzn-@xmath3pt and",
    "its magnesium analogue pmn-@xmath3pt are now being considered as the most promising candidates for the next generation of electromechanical transducers .    in the phase diagram of these systems ,",
    "the mpb was initially believed to be an almost vertical boundary that separates the rhombohedral ( space group @xmath8 ) from the tetragonal ( @xmath9 ) phase and located close to the value of @xmath10 for pzn-@xmath3pt and @xmath11 for pmn-@xmath3pt  @xcite .",
    "when crossing this boundary along the horizontal @xmath3 concentration axis , the system would change abruptly from one phase to the other .",
    "however , near the boundary , there is a delicate microstructural equilibrium that should favor easy local atomic rearrangements .",
    "this explains the very large coefficients observed .",
    "in addition to the known rhombohedral and tetragonal phases , a recent breakthrough has been achieved with the discovery of a sliver of a new monoclinic phase in pzt  @xcite .",
    "new orthorhombic and monoclinic phases have also been found in pzn-@xmath3pt and pmn-@xmath3pt  @xcite .",
    "these new phases play a key role in explaining the high piezoelectric and electrostrictive responses near the mpb . in pzn-@xmath3pt ,",
    "the new phase is of orthorhombic symmetry ( @xmath12 ) and extends in a narrow concentration range around the mpb ( @xmath13 ) with almost vertical phase boundaries on either side ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] )  @xcite .",
    "this new phase can be described as a `` matching '' phase between the rhombohedral and tetragonal phases .",
    "this means that the polarization vector , instead of being aligned with a particular crystal axis , may be pointing in an arbitrary direction within a plane , allowing for a very easy reorientation of the polarization vector  @xcite .",
    "recently , a model@xcite has been proposed , that connects the structural features@xcite of the lead relaxor systems with their unusual polarization properties@xcite .",
    "in addition to the above structural features , there exists another aspect of the polarization properties of relaxor systems , whose precise connection to these structural features has not been established yet .",
    "it is now a well recognized fact that , as relaxors are cooled from high temperatures , any long range structural change , if it develops , is preceded by the appearance and growth of polar nanoregions .",
    "the first indirect observation of such regions came from birefringence measurements by burns and dacol on pmn and pzn  @xcite .",
    "these measurements revealed deviations from a linear temperature dependence of the birefringence @xmath14",
    "(= @xmath15 ) at a temperature @xmath16 , _ i.e. _ far above the temperature range in which pzn displays the relaxor behavior .",
    "it is now believed that this birefringence is due to local asymmetric structural distortions that do not yet have a polar character . since then , several other experimental observations have been reported , that support the appearance of the local distortions in lead relaxors below 650  k for pmn and below 750  k for pzn .",
    "the most direct ones have come from measurements of diffuse x - ray or neutron scattering  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have reported diffuse neutron scattering results on a pzn single crystal upon cooling ( 550  k-295  k ) , which clearly reveal the development of a medium range or mesoscopic order  @xcite .",
    "the width of the diffuse scattering peak , which is related to a correlation length , is shown to provide a measure of the size of the polar nanoregions . at high temperature ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the correlation length is consistent with the curie - weiss dependence of the dielectric constant .",
    "this indicates the purely dynamic character of the polarization , characteristic of paraelectric behavior . at a temperature @xmath17 ( @xmath18 = 40  k ) in pure pzn ,",
    "the lifetime of the polar correlations becomes progressively longer , leading to the formation of the polar nanoregions .",
    "their formation is accompanied by the development of permanent strain fields , which cause the bragg intensity to increase rapidly ( relief of extinction ) .",
    "other indirect evidence for the formation of the polar regions comes from inelastic neutron scattering measurements  @xcite .",
    "particularly noticeable are the results of gehring _ et al .",
    "_ showing the disappearance of the soft transverse optic ( to ) mode from the inelastic neutron scattering spectra of pzn and pzn-@xmath3pt ( as well as pmn and pmn-@xmath3pt )  @xcite .",
    "this disappearance has been attributed to a coupling of the to and ta modes , enhanced by the formation of the polar regions but no precise mechanism has been proposed and the role of the polar regions has not been clearly explained . the goal of the present study was ( i )  to extend the previous pzn study to several reflections in other scattering zones , ( ii )  to identify more definitely the onset of the polar order and verify its temperature evolution , and ( iii )  to investigate the local structural and polar order at higher pt concentrations ( @xmath3 ) . in order to understand the dynamic behavior of the polar regions , acoustic phonon measurements were also made .",

    "pzn is a prototype relaxor ferroelectric that possesses an abo@xmath2 cubic perovskite structure in which the b site can be occupied by two different cations , @xmath19zn@xmath20 and @xmath21nb@xmath22 . because of the different radii and valences of these two cations , pzn exhibits short - range chemical ordering and local fluctuations in composition on a nanometer scale  @xcite .",
    "it begins to transform from a cubic to a rhombohedral phase at @xmath23  k , which falls in the temperature region of the maximum of the dielectric peak .",
    "pbtio@xmath2(pt ) , on the other hand , is a normal perovskite - type ferroelectric that develops a typical long - range ferroelectric order , when transforming from a cubic to a tetragonal phase at @xmath24  k. in the 1980@xmath25s , a series of complete solid solutions of the relaxor pzn and ferroelectric pt were synthesized in the range 0 @xmath26 0.2 .",
    "this led to a very important development in the field of ferroelectrics  @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we report the results of a diffuse neutron scattering study of several pzn-@xmath3pt single crystals with @xmath27=0 , 4.5 , and 9% and propose a model that provides a physical basis for the easy reorientation of the polarization in lead relaxors .",

    "an inset is for @xmath3=4.5 ( at 650 k ) and @xmath3=9 ( at 600 k ) at the ( 100 ) point along the [ 011 ] and [ 111 ] directions in the [ 100]-[011 ] zone . ]",

[ fig6 ] ( a ) , the diffuse scattering intensity increases continuously with decreasing temperature , first slowly down to 500  k , then faster as it approaches @xmath30 k.",
    "also , the overall diffuse intensity is found to be lower in the [ 111 ] direction than in the [ 011 ] direction .",
    "this is consistent with the observations made earlier concerning the preferred direction of the correlations in the pt crystals by contrast with the preferred direction in pure pzn . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( b ) , the full width ( at half maximum ) squared , @xmath28 , is plotted as a function of temperature . as we have explained earlier  @xcite ,",
    "the initial linear dependence , down to 500  k , corresponds to a curie - weiss behavior expected in a temperature range in which the polar correlations are purely dynamic . at",
    "approximately @xmath31 500  k ( or @xmath32 , with @xmath33  k ) , @xmath28 deviates from a straight line and finally levels off at lower temperatures .",
    "the deviation from this linear dependence marks the appearance of long lived and slowly relaxing polar regions .",
    "not unexpectedly , the appearance of the polar regions and the process of slowing down begins at a higher temperature in pzn-@xmath3pt than in pure pzn ( for which @xmath34 40  k ) .",
    "this fact can be ascribed to the enhanced correlations between polar clusters and their stabilization by the tetragonal strain introduced by the presence of pt . below a certain temperature ,",
    "the size of the polar regions saturates and `` freezing '' may occur , as indicated by a constant width of the diffuse scattering peak . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( c ) , we present the temperature dependence of the correlation length for 4.5%pt at the ( 100 ) reflection along the [ 010 ] direction . upon cooling ,",
    "the correlation length increases continuously , but more rapidly below 500 k , and also tends to saturate at low temperatures .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the correlation length in this direction is smaller than in the transverse [ 011 ] direction , as measured in the [ 100]-[011 ] scattering plane .",
    "this is primarily associated with the short - range correlated displacements of the pb atoms  @xcite .    , and ( c ) correlation length for pzn-4.5%pt at the ( 100 ) reciprocal lattice point along the [ 010 ] direction in the [ 100]-[010 ] zone . a triangle and a square represent the results ( at 450 k ) along the [ 011 ] and [ 111 ] directions in the [ 100]-[011 ] zone . ]",
    "the electrostrictive effect arises from the coupling between polarization and acoustic waves or strain . in relaxors ,",
    "the polarization originates from the polar nanoregions . because of the unusually strong electrostriction exhibited by relaxors  @xcite",
    ", one should expect changes in the behavior of the acoustic phonons when the polar regions appear .",
    "such changes should also be expected in coupling between the to and ta phonons .",
    "recent inelastic neutron scattering studies have revealed a very anomalous damping of the to phonon in lead relaxors  @xcite .",
    "this so - called `` waterfall '' effect has been attributed to the to - ta coupling . however , because the waterfall is not observed in conventional ferroelectrics , it is clear that the to - ta coupling can not , by itself , explain this effect .",
    "the strong electrostriction and the polar nanoregions must , therefore , play an essential role . in order to understand this role ,",
    "we have carried out acoustic phonon measurements in 4.5%pt and 9%pt crystals .",
    "constant-@xmath35 scans ( @xmath36 ) were used to collect data on each sample , where @xmath5 is the momentum transfer relative to the @xmath37 = ( 2,0,0 ) and ( 2,1,1 ) bragg points , measured along the [ @xmath38 and [ @xmath39 symmetry directions , respectively .",
    "the peak position of the scattered neutron intensity as a function of @xmath5 ( top ) and the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) as a function of temperature ( bottom ) are presented for 4.5%pt in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( a ) and for 9%pt in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( b ) . the most important feature of these data is the increase in the fwhm of the ta phonon peak upon cooling for intermediate @xmath5 values .",

    "the phonon peak remains narrow at all temperatures , and may even be narrower at 375  k. this is consistent with the fact that no corresponding diffuse scattering was observed at @xmath35 = ( 2,0,0 ) .",
    "broadening of the phonon occurs only for longer @xmath41 . for @xmath40 0.35 rlu ,",
    "the peak is already quite broad at 650  k , suggesting that , the greater the @xmath5 , the higher the temperature at which the phonon becomes heavily damped .",
    "this behavior is definitely consistent with the formation of the polar nanoregions , smaller at high temperature and growing with decreasing temperature .",
    "these results are also consistent with other neutron studies of similar systems . for example , in an earlier inelastic neutron study of pmn , naberezhnov _ et al .",
    "_ reported the broadening of the ta mode at @xmath35 = ( 2,2,0.2 ) , near the burns temperature , @xmath42 650  k  @xcite . very recently , in a study of pmn-20%pt , koo _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite have also reported a similar increase of the ta phonon damping .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the values of @xmath5 at which the ta phonon is observed to broaden in both the previous studies as well as in the present one , are close to @xmath43 at which the waterfall effect has been reported  @xcite .",

    "[ fig7 ] ( b ) .",
    "the peak position@xcite is clearly temperature independent in both directions ( compare solid and open circles ) .",
    "the width or damping of the phonon is greater in the [ @xmath39 direction than in the [ @xmath38 direction .",
    "however , in the [ @xmath38 direction , it is smaller for this crystal than for the 4.5%pt one and it does not increase as fast with decreasing temperature ( compare the fwhm vs. @xmath46 at @xmath35 = ( 2,-0.2,-0.2 ) or @xmath40 0.28 rlu ) .",
    "this observation suggests that the ta damping decreases with increasing pt concentration .",
    "so far 9%pt is the highest concentration that we have studied",
    ". it would be interesting to follow the evolution of the ta damping in pzn-@xmath3pt crystals with higher @xmath3 .",
    "it is by now well established that compositional and/or site disorder brings about the formation of local polar nanoregions in mixed perovskite ferroelectrics , including pmn , pzt , and pzn .",
    "these regions result from short - range correlated ionic displacements  @xcite .",
    "they nucleate at a temperature well above the transition temperature , @xmath47 , and are dispersed as islands throughout the lattice .",
    "diffuse neutron and x - ray scattering provide the most direct evidence for the morphology of these regions .",
    "diffuse scattering results provide two distinct types of information .",
    "the reciprocal lattice points around which diffuse scattering is observed provide information on the symmetry of the local lattice distortions or internal structure of the polar regions , and the shape or distribution of the diffuse scattering intensity around these points gives information on the morphology of the polar regions or the direction in which they grow .",
    "first _ type of information concerns the direction of the polarization vector within the polar regions , and the _ second _ type , the orientation of the strain fields associated with them . in pzn-@xmath3pt ,",
    "the present data show that elastic diffuse scattering is only observed around points where the ( @xmath48 ) indices have mixed parities , in particular ( 100 ) , ( 110 ) , ( 210 ) , ( 300 ) , and ( 310 ) .",
    "diffuse scattering is also strongest around ( 110 ) .",
    "these results are identical to those reported for pure pzn , which we interpreted earlier as revealing the rhombohedral internal structure of the polar regions , consistent with the [ 111 ] displacement of the pb@xmath20 ions  @xcite . if the internal structure and the direction of the polarization vector are the same in both pzn and pzn-@xmath3pt , the direction in which the polar regions grow is different in both systems . in pure pzn",
    ", the diffuse scattering was found to be more extended in a transverse direction ( [ 100 ] or [ 011 ] ) , indicating the growth of the polar regions in a [ 111 ] direction . by contrast , in pzn-@xmath3pt , the diffuse intensity becomes more extended in the diagonal [ 111 ] , indicating the preferential growth of the polar regions in a [ 100 ] or [ 011 ] transverse direction . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the higher the pt concentration and the closer to a tetragonal [ 100 ] , the higher the ratio of the correlation lengths in the transverse and [ 111 ] directions .",
    "this trend is represented schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , for pzn , 4.5%pt , and 9%pt in a [ 110]-[001 ] plane .",
    "thus , with increasing pt , the local polarization direction remains unchanged ( [ 111 ] direction ) , but the polar regions now preferentially grow in a different direction , closer to tetragonal .",
    "pt with increasing concentration @xmath3 . ]    the picture presented in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] illustrates the concept of local polarization and strain fields pointing in two different directions .",
    "the present picture provides a physical basis for the model proposed earlier by fu and cohen , in which the macroscopic polarization vector may be pointing in an arbitrary direction within a plane  @xcite .",
    "the ease of rotation of the macroscopic polarization can now be understood to be due to the fact that the local strain fields only need to reorient by a much smaller angle than the local polarization .",
    "however , it is important to note that , although the results reported here clearly support such a picture , the diffuse scattering ellipse observed in a particular scattering plane may only be the projection of the 3d scattering ellipsoid .",
    "additional measurements would be necessary to map out entirely the diffuse scattering ellipsoids .",
    "the temperature dependence of the diffuse scattering intensity in pzn and pzn-@xmath3pt further demonstrates that it is related to the appearance of the polar nanoregions .",
    "another equally strong element of proof is the absence of diffuse scattering around the ( 200 ) reflection .",
    "this was checked in all possible directions and in two different scattering zones [ 100]-[011 ] and [ 100]-[010 ] . because , in perovskites , the static structure factor that corresponds to the soft phonon mode is largest at the ( 200 ) reflection , the absence of diffuse scattering around this point clearly indicates that it is related to the presence of the local order that develops below 700 - 600 k. a similar result had been obtained earlier by one of us in two different relaxors , k@xmath6l@xmath49tao@xmath50 ( klt ) and kta@xmath6nb@xmath49o@xmath50 ( ktn )  @xcite .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite have recently reported a similar result in pmn and have proposed the concept of the phase - shifted condensed soft mode , to account for the contribution of the polar nanoregions . in their dynamic calculation ,",
    "the atomic displacements include both _ the optic mode displacement _ @xmath51 , satisfying a center of mass condition and _ the single phase shift _ @xmath52 within polar nanoregions .",
    "the result presented above also reveal three important temperature ranges in the behavior of pzn and pzn-@xmath3pt , which seems to be characteristic of all relaxor ferroelectrics .",
    "( i ) at high temperature , @xmath53 , the correlation length squared , @xmath54 , is inversely proportional to temperature .",
    "because @xmath54 is also proportional to the dielectric constant , this temperature dependence corresponds to a curie - weiss law , which indicates that , in this range , the polarization is entirely dynamic and the system behaves as a normal paraelectric .",
    "( ii ) below @xmath55 , the deviation from this curie - weiss law reflects the appearance of long - lived polar fluctuations in the crystal , accompanied by local strain fields ; it is also in this range that the dielectric constant begins to exhibit a strong frequency dispersion , the relaxor behavior .",
    "this behavior is clearly due to the reorientation of the polarization or , as seen from the structural results reported here , of the long - lived polar nanoregions . with the addition of pt",
    ", @xmath55 increases from @xmath47 + 40 k in pzn to @xmath47 + 70 k in 4.5%pt .",
    "this trend is due to enhanced correlations between polar regions with increasing pt concentration .",
    "( iii ) as the temperature is further decreased below @xmath55 , and as the polar regions grow , their local strain fields increase in strength and their reorientation becomes slower . in pzn",
    ", it is believed that there is no overall preferred [ 111 ] orientation , so that individual polar nanoregions eventually freeze out with their polarization in one of eight possible [ 111 ] axial directions , each according to their local strain field .",
    "hence , the mosaicity increases and , due to the relief of extinction below @xmath56 k , the bragg intensity rapidly rises .",
    "this interpretation is borne out by the fact that the bragg intensity remains high at lower temperatures .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , simultaneously , the dielectric constant decreases rapidly at lower temperatures , which also confirms the freezing - in of the polar regions in pzn",
    ".    the addition of pt increases the magnitude of the local distorsions , with a tendency towards tetragonal symmetry , as in pbtio@xmath2 . in all of this",
    ", it is important to remember that strain is the dominant cause of orientational freezing and that the strain energy is the same whether the polarization points up or down .",
    "further addition of pt increases the tetragonal strain , leading to an abrupt structural transition in 4.5 % pt at 430 k and two in 9%pt , at 450 k and 340 k , respectively .",
    "the abrupt character of these transitions suggests the first order character of strain - driven transitions .    in summary , the present elastic scattering results can be conveniently interpreted within the framework of three main temperature regions : ( i ) dynamic polarization fluctuations at high temperature ( @xmath57k@xmath58k ) , ( ii ) condensation of polar nanoregions that can still reorient as a unit and progressive slowing down of the reorientational motion at intermediate temperatures ( @xmath59 ) , and ( iii ) orientational freezing of the polar nanoregions at low temperatures ( @xmath60 ) , with or without an explicit structural transition at @xmath61 .    when investigating the polarization dynamics of relaxors , it is also important to examine the ta phonons , since these can couple to the reorientation of the localized strain fields that are known to accompany the formation of the polar nanoregions  @xcite . in pmn and pmn-20%pt ,",
    "naberezhnov _ et al . _ and koo _ et",
    "al._@xcite have reported broadening of the ta phonon starting at @xmath16 , and near the wavevector @xmath43 at which the to phonon has been reported to disappear ( `` waterfall '' )  @xcite .",
    "these authors have linked the onset of damping of the ta and the onset of birefringence at @xmath16 to the appearance of the polar nanoregions .",
    "however , both these results only indicate the appearance of local distortions and strain fields but do not provide information as to the possible polar character of these local distortions . in our measurements of 4.5%pt and 9%pt , damping of the ta phonon is seen to increase , starting at @xmath62 .",
    "it also starts at a large @xmath5 first and at smaller @xmath5 with decreasing temperature .",
    "in other words , we find that , at a given temperature , the larger the @xmath5 , the higher the damping .",
    "in fact , we do expect such a trend from the coupling to smaller distorted regions at higher temperatures and to larger and slower ones at lower temperatures .",
    "in fact , our results show that , in the temperature range @xmath53 , the correlation length follows a curie - weiss law , characteristic of a paraelectric state in which the polarization is completely dynamic .",
    "the polar nanoregions only appear in earnest at @xmath55 , which is also the temperature at which the dielectric constant begins to exhibit frequency dispersion , _",
    "i.e. _ the relaxor behavior . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( a ) for 4.5%pt , the phonon damping begins to increase at @xmath63 500 k ( _ i.e. _ at @xmath55 ) and @xmath35 = ( 2,-0.14,-0.14 ) ( or @xmath40 0.20 rlu ) , which corresponds to about 5 unit cells  @xcite .",
    "this result is consistent with the size of the polar regions derived from our diffuse neutron elastic scattering data ( table  [ correlation ] ) .",
    "such an agreement provides evidence that the increase in ta phonon damping is connected to the appearance of the polar regions .",
    "the hypersonic damping properties studied by the brillouin scattering has provided a clear indication of ferroelectric ordering in complex relaxor ferroelectric  @xcite . in 9%pt ,",
    "the ta phonon damping is lower than in 4.5%pt ( bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) but shows a similar trend .",
    "it is important to note that the measured ta phonon corresponds to the c@xmath64 elastic modulus , which can couple to the reorientations of a strain field with rhombohedral symmetry between different [ 111 ] directions .",
    "the higher frequency of the ta phonon in 9%pt than in 4.5%pt ( top of fig .  [ fig7 ] ) indicates that c@xmath64 is higher in 9%pt .",
    "both observations , lower damping and higher ta phonon frequency , suggest that , with increasing pt , the polar regions are less able to reorient and the lattice becomes more rigid .",
    "further work is in progress on the ta phonons as well as on the low frequency rotational dynamics associated with the reorientation of the polar regions in single crystals of pzn-@xmath3pt .",
    "neutron _ elastic _ diffuse scattering in pzn , pzn-4.5%pt , and pzn-9%pt appears at temperatures well above the phase transition ( @xmath65 700 - 600 k ) , marking the formation of local distortions at @xmath16 , which acquire a polar character at the lower temperature @xmath55 . in both pure pzn and pzn-@xmath3pt ,",
    "diffuse scattering is observed only around reciprocal lattice points with mixed parity indices , which is indicative of the rhombohedral internal symmetry of the polar nanoregions . from the orientation of the diffuse scattering ellipsoids around these points",
    ", it appears that , in pzn , the correlations preferentially develop along a diagonal or [ 111 ] direction . with increasing pt , these correlations shift towards a transverse direction , most likely [ 100 ] , consistent with the widening of the tetragonal phase field for higher pt concentrations",
    "nonetheless , it is important to emphasize that , with the addition of pt , the internal structure of the polar regions remains rhombohedral .",
    "this distinction between the [ 111 ] distortion of the local unit cells and the [ 100 ] orientation of the correlations may constitute an essential feature of the pb - relaxor ferroelectrics . upon cooling , pzn and pzn-@xmath3pt",

    ", it appears that the reorienting polar regions couple to the ta phonons , leading to their softening and increased damping .",
    "comparison of the phonon results with the temperature and @xmath5 dependence of the diffuse scattering results does indeed suggests that the ta broadening originates from the reorientation of strain fields associated with the polar nanoregions .",
