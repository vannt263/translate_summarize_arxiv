    ", this occurred some 1.6 gyr ago ( table  [ tbl : pn_par ] ) . due to the limited accuracy of s / h and ar / h in the hii regions , and especially in the pn ( in the latter the errors are on the order of about 40% ",

    "however , the values for relative enrichment , derived independently for sulfur , ( s / h)@xmath76/(s / h)@xmath77 = 3.17 ( @xmath78)@xmath21.05 , and argon , ( ar / h)@xmath76/(ar / h)@xmath77 = 2.99 ( @xmath79)@xmath20.54 , are consistent with each other .",
    "we give the estimates of the uncertainties of these ratios in the above form since , due to the large relative errors of the values in the denominators , 1@xmath15 intervals are highly non - symmetric ; the values in parenthesis give the uncertainties in the denominators , while the last term describes the uncertainties in the numerators .",
    "the weighted average value is @xmath33.1@xmath80 or equivalently , 0.5@xmath20.2 dex .",
    "this rather large enrichment in @xmath12-elements may be caused by the increase in the star formation rate during the last @xmath312 gyr .",

    "the comparison of element abundances in three hii regions and in the pn suggests that the region of sextans  a where the pn progenitor formed was as metal - deficient as i  zw  18 is now @xcite .",
    "moreover , assuming the element abundance pattern in the gas of which the pn progenitor formed to be typical of very low - metallicity hii galaxies , we conclude that the progenitor star , with an estimated mass of 1.5m@xmath74 , enriched the material of this pn by a factor of @xmath310 in oxygen ( from the value of 12+@xmath1(o / h)=7.04 to the current value of 8.02 ) , and by a factor of @xmath3750 in nitrogen .      previously , @xcite observed , according to their description , hii@xmath45 ( although the object indicated on their finding chart seems to be closer to hii@xmath410 ) .",
    "they did not detect [ oiii ] @xmath134363 and presented a lower limit on o / h , equivalent to 12+@xmath1(o / h)@xmath827.4 .",
    "later , four hii regions ( hii@xmath41 , 2 , 5 , and 10 ) were observed by skh89 .",
    "these authors failed to detect [ oiii ] @xmath134363 . to determine o / h",
    ", they used the empirical strong lines relation ( which has an internal accuracy of 50% ) by @xcite and derived a lower limit for o / h in hii@xmath45 .",
    "their resulting value for the oxygen abundance of sextans b was 12+@xmath1(o / h)=7.56 .",

    "the oxygen and other element abundances are very similar . for the third hii region ( hii@xmath45 in figure [ fig : sexb_ha ] , at @xmath30.6 kpc ne ) the oxygen abundance ( 12+@xmath1(o / h)=7.84@xmath20.05 ) is larger than for the former two by a factor of 2.05@xmath20.35",

    "all these ratios are consistent to within their rms uncertainties .",
    "their mean abundances imply an enrichment by a factor of @xmath32.5 relative to the element abundances in hii@xmath41 and 2 .",
    "these differences are significant for each of the four elements at a confidence level corresponding to 4  @xmath88 , where @xmath88 is the combined rms error of the difference ( on a linear scale ) between the abundances in hii@xmath45 and the average on hii@xmath41 and 2 .",
    "we have checked whether our results for hii@xmath45 are consistent with the o / h value from mam90 . for this",
    "we recalculated their o / h in our system , using their relative line intensities , and obtained 12+@xmath1(o / h)=8.06 .",
    "this is consistent with our value to within @xmath32@xmath88 .",
    "the main difference comes from our higher ( by a factor of 1.5 ) relative intensity of [ oiii ] @xmath134363 , which is detected in our spectrum at an 8@xmath15 level compared to a 4@xmath15 detection in mam90 .",
    "therefore , we consider our element abundances to be more reliable .",
    "we also note that the apparent problem with the small value of @xmath1(n / o ) = @xmath41.8 in this hii region that was pointed out by @xcite from the data of mam90 , does not exist according to our data .",
    "while the disagreement between the o / h values of skh89 and mam90 could ( in principle ) be considered as an indication of o / h inhomogeneity , our data provide the first _",
    "firm _ evidence of such chemical inhomogeneity in the interstellar medium of sextans b on scales of @xmath30.51 kpc .",
    "in contrast to the pn in sextans  a , the accuracy of the o / h and n / h ratios measured in pn3 in sextans  b allows us to formulate only very preliminary conclusions .",
    "o / h and n / h in this pn are very close to the average values derived for sextans  b hii regions 1 and 2 ( the difference is @xmath890.5 @xmath88 ) .",
    "the measured relative abundance log(n / o ) = 1.48@xmath20.24 for this pn is well consistent with the average values for the most metal - poor hii galaxies @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the enrichment in o and n is sufficiently small and in general does not exceed the uncertainty of log(n / o ) . adopting the 95% confidence level for the possible o and n abundances in pn3 ,",
    "we conclude that the maximum o and n enrichment since the epoch of the pn progenitor s formation does not exceed @xmath30.4 dex .      summarizing the results on the element abundances in sextans",
    "b , we conclude that our new spectroscopy confirms earlier conclusions ( based on lower accuracy measurements ) that some of the nearby dirr galaxies reveal considerable abundance inhomogeneities among their hii regions .",
    "this is an important finding since dirr galaxies are usually believed to be chemically well - mixed and homogeneous at a given age . to confidently determine the average ism metallicity in a well - resolved dirr galaxy one thus needs to measure its abundances in several regions .",
    "various processes ( such as metal - enriched outflows , self - enrichment on a time - scale of a few myr , or infalling metal - poor intergalactic hi clouds ) can in principle be responsible for the local deviations of the ism metallicity from some average galactic value",
    ". they may result in either an excess or a deficiency as compared to the galactic mean .",
    "note that in the lower - mass dwarf spheroidal galaxies there are indications for chemical inhomogeneities in terms of possible radial gradients among their old stellar populations @xcite .",
    "the available data on hii regions of sextans  b , taken at face value , are inconclusive in terms of constraining the probable cause of the inhomogeneities .",
    "it is unfortunate that older tracers of the chemical evolutionary history of galaxies like sextans  b are so difficult to measure . for the time",
    "being , only photometric estimates are available for the old population(s ) , based either on isochrones or on globular cluster red giant branch fiducials . for sextans  b it would be useful to observe more hii regions at a sufficient depth to detect the [ oiii ] @xmath134363 line , in order to explore what level of present - day metallicity is characteristic of the entire galaxy .",
    "the other three hii regions visible in our long - slit spectra will require observations with an 8-m class telescope to reach an adequate signal to noise level .",
    "it is worth noting that the census of hii region metallicities in dirr galaxies in the lg and its surroundings is rather unsatisfactory . only in the magellanic clouds",
    "can the number and spatial extent of hii regions with measured element abundances be considered sufficient for investigations of the chemical inhomogeneity problem ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "but even in the smc , the situation could be improved ; while in the former study 19 hii regions were studied across much of the radial extent of the clouds , @xmath35@xmath90 ( @xmath35 kpc ) , the uncertainties of the individual o / h values seem too large to exclude possible variations at the level of @xmath30.3 dex ( this level of variations we see in sextans  b ) . in the latter study the errors of o / h are reasonably small , and they are consistent for all three measured hii regions to within 20% ( or 0.08 dex ) , but all three regions are located close to each other within a circle @xmath320 pc in diameter .    for most of the other nearby dirr galaxies , o / h values are based on old data , generally of poor to moderate signal to noise for [ oiii ] @xmath134363 .",
    "alternatively ( or in addition ) , in many cases only one to two hii regions per galaxy were measured ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the existing data for most nearby dirr galaxies do not allow one to draw a definite conclusion on chemical inhomogeneities in the ism at a level of @xmath30.3 dex across the entire galaxy .",
    "the general claim by @xcite that there is `` no evidence for significant dispersion of oxygen abundances in any local group dirrs in which multiple hii regions have been studied '' should therefore be treated with some caution ; this statement probably applies only to variations with an amplitude of @xmath30.4 dex or higher .",
    "we are aware of only a few similar occurrences in nearby dirr galaxies : in the lg dirr galaxies smc and wlm and in the m  81 group dwarf holmberg  ii .",
    "star clusters in the smc appear to differ in their metallicity at a given age @xcite , which seems to indicate differences in the chemical composition in different regions of this galaxies at a given time . in wlm",
    ", @xcite discovered that one of two studied blue supergiants has a clearly higher [ o / h ] than the value measured for the hii region wlm hm@xmath47 , situated 300 pc away from this star .",
    "the supergiant exceeds the [ o / h ] of the ism by @xmath910.7 dex at a 3@xmath15 level , a curious difference for which an explanation still needs to be found @xcite . for holmberg",
    "ii we estimated from the data of @xcite that the weighted average of 12+@xmath1(o / h ) for four hii regions where [ oiii ] @xmath134363 was measured is 7.63@xmath20.08 , while for the hii@xmath46 region the 2@xmath15 lower limit is indicated as 7.97 ; in this galaxy several hii regions show low abundances , while one appears to be enriched by a factor of @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite , in their analysis of dispersal and mixing of oxygen in the ism of gas - rich galaxies , gave a fairly low characteristic time of 1.5 myr for local mixing of freshly ejected nucleosynthesis products due to raleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities in star - forming regions .",
    "while these processes are likely to be very efficient in mixing freshly released processed heavy elements into the ambient ism , detailed numerical simulations would be desirable that take the specific conditions in our target galaxies into account . in their analysis of a large sample of hii galaxies , @xcite",
    "also conclude that some self - enrichment should play a role in these objects in order to match all observed correlations .",
    "galaxies of different types generally follow a trend of increased global metallicity with increased luminosity , although offsets exist between different galaxy types ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ggh03 hereafter ) .",
    "the lower o / h in two hii regions of sextans b gives a better agreement with the empirical relation between o / h and the blue luminosity for dwarf irregular galaxies ( e.g. , skh89 ) , while the higher value of o / h in the hii@xmath45 region shifts sextans  b well above the 12+@xmath1(o / h ) vs @xmath92 relation .",
    "thus , the hypothesis of a significant overabundance in the region hii@xmath45 , related to localized metal pollution , sounds more realistic .",
    "however , as discussed earlier , so far such cases appear to be quite rare .",
    "this is in some aspects similar to the detection of a significant nitrogen overabundance ( on the spatial scale of @xmath350 pc ) in the central starburst of a nearby dwarf starburst galaxy , ngc 5253 @xcite , again supporting very short characteristic timescales of local enrichment and subsequent dispersal as suggested by @xcite .",
    "this may then imply that we caught the evolution of hii@xmath45 during the short period when fresh @xmath12-elements were just mixed into the @xmath310@xmath93  k medium via stellar winds and supernova ejecta , but prior to their dilution via the mechanisms discussed , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the detection of chemical inhomogeneities in the star - forming regions across the body of a dwarf galaxy is facilitated by the high spatial resolution of our study ( @xmath36 pc ) , which avoids the effective smearing of the localized short time - scale enrichment in more distant actively star - forming galaxies due to limited angular / spatial resolution .",
    "obviously , this also implies that galaxies with many hii regions offer a better chance to detect inhomogeneities than dirrs with only one or two hii regions .    in order to better understand possible reasons for the observed metal excess in hii@xmath45",
    ", more detailed and higher angular resolution studies of this region would be helpful .",
    "if the excess is indeed related to the recent effective mixing of the hii region s gas with matter from a hot bubble , some tracers of such a process could be imprinted in the ionized gas kinematics , or in additional ionization and excitation compared to more typical cases .",
    "how do the spectroscopic results compare with the photometric enrichment history derived by @xcite ? using synthetic color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) techniques , these authors found a fairly constant average stellar metallicity throughout the galaxy s history of [ fe / h ] @xmath91 @xmath41.45@xmath20.2 .",
    "they suggest that most of the enrichment occurred more than 10 gyr ago . for the old red giant branch ggh03 quote an approximate photometric mean metallicity of @xmath94 dex , estimated from comparison with globular cluster red giant branch fiducials .",
    "@xcite s star formation history implies that more than half of the stellar mass formed during that early period .",
    "however , @xcite also caution that the early star formation history can not be accurately inferred from the available hst data .",
    "approximately 10 gyr ago the average star formation ( sf hereafter ) rate dropped for a period of @xmath37.5 gyr by a factor of @xmath320 with only about 5% of all stellar mass forming during that intermediate - age period . presumably , the low sf intensity would have been accompanied by little chemical enrichment . about 12 gyr ago",
    "the sf again increased drastically , resulting in the formation of about 30% of the stellar mass of sextans  a. this latter episode of active star formation should have been accompanied by a significant production of metals .",
    "the present - day spectroscopic metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath91 @xmath41.1 dex ( from hii regions and young a supergiants ) is consistent with an enrichment of about 0.4 dex compared to the average stellar metallicity from @xcite , and with an enrichment of @xmath95 dex compared to the mean metallicity of the old red giants in sextans  a @xcite .",
    "one can not exclude , however , that due to the powerful energy release over the period of increased star formation during the past 12 gyr a significant fraction of freshly synthesized heavy elements was blown away .",
    "thus , the metallicity in the young population and ism may indicate only a lower limit of the true metal production during this period .",
    "in the above scenario , the results for the star formation history and metal enrichment of sextans  a , derived from photometric data , are compatible with our conclusion of 0.5@xmath20.2 dex enrichment according to the comparison of the hii region abundances and the data on s and ar abundances in the sole pn of sextans  a. as we show in table  [ tbl : pn_par ] the pn progenitor was a low - mass star with @xmath31.5  m@xmath70 and an age of @xmath31.6 gyr , i.e. , it formed at that time when the star formation rate and the accompanying enrichment showed a marked increase , according to @xcite .      for sextans",
    "b , the deepest published cmd is based on hst data @xcite but only covers the upper red giant branch .",
    "hence no attempt was made to derive the star formation history of sextans b from these data .",
    "however , the cmd of @xcite allows us to draw the following qualitative conclusions : sextans b possesses a substantial intermediate - age to old population with ages exceeding @xmath96 gyr as evidenced by its very well populated , prominent red giant branch .",
    "our estimate of the age of the observed pn progenitor ( see table  [ tbl : pn_par ] ) also supports the idea that sextans b had increased sf about 6 gyr ago .",
    "ggh03 suggest a mean photometric metallicity of @xmath97 dex for the old population through comparison of the red giant branch with globular cluster fiducials .",
    "the cmd of @xcite also shows the presence of a large number of luminous asymptotic giant branch stars above the tip of the red giant branch , and an extended group of young blue main - sequence stars and blue - loop stars .",
    "red supergiants appear to be present as well .",
    "to summarize , the cmd shows the typical features also known from many other dirr galaxies , which support the scenario of star formation continuing over a hubble time ( e.g. , grebel 1999 ) . in earlier work based on much shallower ground - based data",
    ", @xcite studied the recent star formation history of sextans b up to 1 gyr and found moderate star formation activity , probably intermittent .",
    "they provide a rough photometric estimate of the young population s stellar metallicity of @xmath98 dex . while they claim that the oxygen abundance in the hii@xmath410 region of 12+@xmath1(o / h)=8.1 ( mam90 ) is in the perfect agreement with their stellar metallicity estimate , this is no longer correct . in the modern calibration",
    "the above oxygen abundance corresponds to [ o / h]=@xmath40.65 .",
    "the current ism metallicity , as measured here by o / h in the two low - metallicity hii regions , corresponds to [ o / h ] = @xmath41.13@xmath20.07 .",
    "the latter , however , is in agreement with the estimate of the young population s stellar metallicity from @xcite .",
    "we estimated in section  [ txt : disc_abun_sextb ] that the maximum o and n enrichment during the last few gyr does not exceed @xmath30.4 dex for sextans  b. if this is true , one can suggest that most of the enrichment occured in sextans  b more than 6 gyr ago , as would also be suggested by the very low metallicity of the old red giant branch in sextans  b derived by ggh03 .",
    "the qualitative star formation history of sextans b over the total cosmological time , based on all previously available cmd data is summarized by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it may have shown a pronounced early star formation rate during the first few gyr with a subsequent period of possibly lower star formation activity and a potential increase at more recent times ( say , 12 gyr ago ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that there is still very little quantitative information on the star formation history of sextans  b.",
    "the general similarity of the sf histories of both sextans a and b and other nearby dwarf irregulars is important in the aspect of dwarf galaxy evolution in small galaxy groups .",
    "this likely implies that the sf drivers are similar in the lg and this particular dwarf group .",
    "another question concerns the nature of significant differences in sf histories during the last several gyr ; since there appears to be little correlation between the sf histories of sextans  a and b , it is tempting to suggest that the sf during this period was mainly due to intrinsic processes , unrelated to the tidal action from a nearby neighbor .",
    "indeed , the estimate of tidal forces between the two dwarfs , based on their projected distance of @xmath3250 pc , total masses of @xmath3(48)@xmath910@xmath99 m@xmath70 and holmberg radii of @xmath30.80.9 kpc @xcite results in a relative strength of tides of the order of 10@xmath100 .",
    "however , this issue needs more careful study including the morphology and kinematics of gas and stars in these galaxies , and more importantly , constraints on their orbits .    while the sf histories of dwarf galaxies of the same morphological type exhibit similar overall properties and trends , they differ in the details",
    ". indeed , each dwarf has its own unique evolutionary history ( e.g. , grebel 1997 ) .",
    "these differences become most pronounced on scales of a fraction of a gyr , but may encompass time scales of several gyr . in the absence of detailed , deep cmds and detailed information on the chemical evolution of such galaxies , the pn census may serve as a possible indicator . since the absolute magnitudes @xmath101 of sextans a and b are very similar ( see table  [ tbl : general ] ) , and since their global sf histories appear to be similar , we should then expect that both galaxies also have a comparable number of pne .",
    "instead , surveys for pne in the two dirrs have revealed a difference by a factor of 5 in the pn census .",
    "this may imply that sextans  b experienced a significantly higher sf rate during the aforementioned time interval .",
    "similar conclusions the likely differing sf histories in sextans  a and b during last few gyr were reached by @xcite .",
    "in this paper we presented new determinations of the chemical abundances of six hii regions in sextans a and b , and of one pn in each of these galaxies . based on the data and discussion presented in the paper ,",
    "the following conclusions can be drawn :    \\1 .",
    "we confirmed with good accuracy the low ism metallicity of both galaxies , with 12+@xmath1(o / h ) = 7.54@xmath20.06 in three hii regions in sextans a , and 12+@xmath1(o / h ) = 7.53@xmath20.05 in two hii regions in sextans b. the element abundance ratios of o , n , s , and ar are well consistent with the expected patterns of very metal - poor hii galaxies .",
    "new high accuracy chemical abundances in the hii regions of sextans a and b allowed us to probe the present - day metallicity homogeneity across the bodies of the respective galaxies .",
    "while our statistics are still poor ( three hii regions per galaxy ) , we find that in sextans a the measured abundances in all three hii regions show no differences exceeding 0.1 dex ( at the 63% confidence level ) .",
    "moreover , the metallicities of three a - supergiants studied by @xcite are in good agreement with those of the hii regions .    \\3 . in sextans",
    "b one hii region ( hii@xmath45 ) is significantly enriched , with an excess in o , n , s , and ar of a factor of 2.5@xmath20.5 relative to the mean value of the two other hii regions studied here .",
    "this is strong evidence for chemical inhomogeneity in a dirr galaxy .",
    "whether this implies a general chemical inhomogeneity among populations of comparable age in sextans b , and thus a metallicity spread at a given age , or whether we happen to see the short - lived effects of freshly ejected nucleosynthesis products prior to their dispersal and mixing with the ambient interstellar medium will require further study .",
    "chemical abundances derived for the pn in sextans  a show that this is a type  i object with a highly elevated nitrogen abundance : n / o @xmath32.5 .",
    "its o / h is about a factor of 3 higher than in the hii regions , which implies significant self - pollution by the pn progenitor .",
    "the abundances of s and ar indicate that the ism metallicity was @xmath30.5 dex lower at the time of the formation of the pn progenitor , compared to that currently measured in hii regions . in this case",
    "the pn progenitor enriched the material by a factor of @xmath310 in oxygen , and by a factor of @xmath3750 in nitrogen .",
    "the element abundances of pn3 in sextans b are consistent with those of the two hii regions with low metallicity .",
    "comparison of the element abundances for this pn and the two nearby hii regions implies that the maximum o and n enrichment during the last few gyr ( the estimated age of the progenitor star of pn3 ) did not exceed @xmath30.4 dex .    \\6 . despite the overall similarity of sextans",
    "a and b , their star formation history and enrichment history over the last few gyr looks quite different , as evidenced by both the number of hii regions and pne , and their abundances . the overall chemical enrichment experienced by sextans a and b",
    "as judged from the estimated mean metallicity of their old red giant branch populations and their hii regions has spanned at least 0.8 dex .",
    "this number is a lower limit since it refers to the mean red giant metallicity and necessarily neglects the still unknown metallicity of the most metal - poor giants in the two dirrs .",

    "<S> both dirrs show generally similar star formation histories in the sense of continuous star formation with amplitude variations , but differ in their detailed enrichment time scales and star formation rates as a function of time . if we combine the photometrically derived estimates for the mean metallicity of the old red giant branch population in both dirrs with the present - day metallicity of the hii regions , both dirrs have experienced chemical enrichment by at least 0.8 dex ( lower limit ) throughout their history . </S>"
