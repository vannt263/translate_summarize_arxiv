    "discretizations of field theories have become a viable tool for both classical and quantum physics . on the one hand ,",
    "numerical treatments of for instance gravity require discretization , on the other hand , lattice quantum field theories give access to non  perturbative physics .",
    "one might even expect that discrete structures will play a fundamental role in quantum gravity  as opposed to just providing an auxiliary uv cut  off . indeed in many approaches to quantum gravity",
    "such discrete structures either appear as fundamental ingredients , as derived from a continuum quantization or as auxiliary structures .",
    "independent from the interpretation of these discrete structures as fundamental or auxiliary , the question arises how to retrieve the continuum physics we experience at larger scales from the microscopic models involving discrete structures .",
    "this applies in particular to the emergence of continuum symmetries , as these influence physical predictions as well as the interpretation of the models .    for general relativity diffeomorphism symmetry plays an extraordinary important role as it is deeply intertwined with the dynamics of the theory .",
    "unfortunately diffeomorphism symmetry is usually broken by discretization @xcite .",
    "this leads to severe difficulties both for covariant and canonical quantization approaches .    in the covariant approach ,",
    "breaking of gauge symmetries leads to additional degrees of freedom .",
    "the gauge modes which for an exact symmetry completely decouple from the physical modes will become relevant and couple to the remaining modes if the gauge symmetries are broken .",
    "hence these modes have to be taken into account in a quantization ( and can not be gauge fixed ) , but should become irrelevant in the continuum limit .    in the canonical approach , the dynamics of general relativity is encoded in the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints . the central problem in the canonical quantization program",
    "is to implement these constraints into the quantization . here",
    ", breaking of diffeomorphism symmetry leads to inconsistencies in the dynamics defined by these constraints , which severely impedes the quantization of the constrained theory .",
    "this has been a huge obstacle to canonical gravity lattice models @xcite , see however the suggestions in @xcite . for further discussions of these points and related issues see @xcite and references therein .",
    "discretizations that would preserve some notion of diffeomorphism symmetry what kind of diffeomorphism symmetry one would expect in a discretized theory . ] would therefore be very appreciated .",
    "indeed there is an approach to construct such discretizations .",
    "the associated discrete actions , encoding the discretized dynamics , are called perfect actions @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to map continuum physics onto the lattice by a coarse graining process .",
    "the resulting lattice theory will then mirror exactly continuum dynamics in its coarse grained observables .",
    "hence one would also expect the continuum symmetries to be present in this lattice dynamics ( at least those , which have not been absorbed by the coarse graining process ) .",
    "furthermore this process might lead to ` lattice independent ' lattice theories .",
    "that is not only are lattice artifacts avoided and predictions should not depend on the choice of lattice .",
    "more fundamentally , observables of the theory should not depend in any way on lattice sites .",
    "this corresponds to the requirement of diffeomorphism invariant  hence coordinate independent  observables in the continuum .",
    "such observables are known from topological lattice models , where there are only finitely many global observables . for 4d gravity",
    ", we however expect the number of such observables to scale with the number of lattice sites .",
    "the coarse graining process can be performed in two different ways .",
    "one is to consider a ` block transformation from the continuum ' , i.e. to have only one coarse graining step from an infinitesimal lattice constant to a finite one @xcite .",
    "this should result immediately into a theory where continuum symmetries are preserved .",
    "there is a disadvantage however , namely that coarse graining always involves solving at least partially the theory .",
    "hence this method requires some control over the solutions .",
    "coarse graining can be also performed in many small steps from smaller to larger scales .",
    "this usually allows one to introduce approximations , in the ( frequent ) case , that exact evaluations are not possible and is related to the ideas of wilsonian renormalization group flow @xcite .",
    "as many quantum gravity models are discrete on the microscopic scale one would here rather adopt the second strategy . indeed , even classical gravity being a very hard to solve theory",
    ", we can not expect to obtain a perfect action easily .",
    "the prospect is rather to understand the coarse graining process better and to derive conditions on the microscopic theory , so that diffeomorphism symmetry will arise at macroscopic scales .",
    "mostly , discrete gravity models can only be solved numerically .",
    "an alternative is to consider a perturbative approach and to coarse grain the theory order by order in the perturbations . in this work",
    "we will start with gravity linearized on a flat background . in this case",
    "the ( linearized ) gauge symmetries of the continuum are typically still realized .",
    "these are however broken in the higher order theory .",
    "this actually leads to inconsistencies in the perturbative approach @xcite . from the higher order equation of motions",
    "non - linear consistency equations arise , which determine the gauge degrees of freedom , present at lower order .    to avoid these inconsistency issues one has to ` perfectionize ' the action order by order .",
    "that is a second order perfect action will allow a consistent solution of the theory truncated at third order  where all the lower order gauge parameters remain free .",
    "we therefore consider in this work the first step  the coarse graining of quadratic actions , that is free theories . here",
    "the main point we address , is to coarse grain theories with gauge symmetries in a gauge covariant way , that is without involving a gauge fixing .",
    "this is inevitable for discrete gravity , as due to the breaking of diffeomorphism symmetries gauge fixing is not a viable procedure anymore starting with the third order theory .",
    "we will leave the consideration of higher order perturbations for future work .",
    "as will be explained in section [ sec : linearizedgravity ] the expected gauge symmetries for discrete gravity have a very geometric interpretation .",
    "we will therefore always be motivated in our choice of discrete action and the coarse graining procedure by geometric reasoning . for ( linearized )",
    "discrete gravity we will derive an action and a coarse graining map derived from regge gravity @xcite , which in itself is a very geometric discretization of gravity . an indication that this choice is suitable , will be provided by 3d gravity , whose ( linearized ) discrete action will turn out to be form invariant under coarse graining , as expected from a topological theory .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows",
    ". we will start by reviewing basic coarse graining for free fields in section [ conv ] , also to introduce our conventions and notations .",
    "this formalism will be applied to coarse grain the free scalar field both from a finite lattice to a coarse grained finite lattice and by coarse graining from the continuum to a finite lattice , section [ sec : scalarfield ] .",
    "we will then develop the formalism in order to coarse grain theories with gauge degrees of freedom in section [ sec : coarsegrainingwithgauge ] .",
    "to this end we will first discuss the behavior of gauge symmetries under coarse graining in section [ sec : subgaugedofundercoarse ] .",
    "in particular we will argue , which kind of discrete diffeomorphism symmetry one might expect for a perfect action for discrete gravity .",
    "the formalism will then be applied to electromagnetism in section [ sec : electromagnetism ] and we will show that for 2d electromagnetism the action is form invariant under coarse graining .    finally we will provide a discrete action and a coarse graining map for linearized gravity in section [ sec : linearizedgravity ] . again we will show that with this choice the 3d linearized gravity action is form invariant under coarse graining .",
    "we will end with a short summary and an outlook .",
    "the appendix [ appmetric ] contains some material on the relation between regge calculus and the discretization for gravity employed here , so that we can provide a geometric derivation of the coarse graining map . in appendix [ somesums ]",
    "we evaluate some sums , which are needed for the coarse graining of 2d electromagnetism and 3d gravity .",
    "here we will consider the coarse graining of free field theories without gauge symmetries on the lattice .",
    "we derive a general formula for the coarse grained action that we will apply to a free scalar field , reproducing the results of @xcite .",
    "we will consider fields @xmath0 , with @xmath1 a yet to be specified index , on a @xmath2-dimensional periodic lattice with @xmath3 sites @xmath4 .",

    "b(y ) . here",
    "we assume that @xmath5 does only depend on the difference @xmath6 , that is that the action is invariant under ( lattice ) translations . for most of the discussion we will work with the fourier transformed fields .",

    "namely , what has been done , is to split the variational problem for the action @xmath19 into two parts : first one looks for extrema under the condition that the @xmath18 coarse grain to @xmath14 .",

    "note that the appearance of the factor @xmath87 in the denominator in the coarse grained action ( [ 1df ] ) renders it non  local .",
    "this can be avoided ( but only for one  dimensional systems ) by changing the coarse graining map appropriately @xcite .",
    "for instance coarse graining by decimation , where the coarse grained field is just given by the values of the original field on the coarse grained lattice , will lead to a local coarse grained action in one dimension .",
    "the formalism in section [ conv ] can only be applied if the dynamics does not feature gauge symmetries , as otherwise the matrix @xmath5 in the action ( [ b1 ] ) is not invertible .",
    "of course one can perform a gauge fixing procedure , as is used for instance in @xcite for yang mills theory .",
    "we are here however interested in regaining gauge symmetries , hence we rather prefer to adopt a gauge invariant framework .",
    "another advantage in doing so , is that topological field theories , i.e. those without propagating degrees of freedom , such as 2d electromagnetism and 3d gravity , will have form invariant actions under coarse graining .",
    "furthermore , a gauge fixing approach is not suitable for discrete gravity : as mentioned in the introduction , discretizations of general relativity usually break diffeomorphism symmetry @xcite . here",
    "we understand under a gauge symmetry the property , that for given fixed boundary data the solutions of the theory are not unique .",
    "this characterization depends however on the kind of solution ( specified by the boundary data ) under consideration .",
    "indeed in most discretizations of gravity , such as regge gravity @xcite , flat space solutions are not unique .",
    "the reason is the following : regge calculus involves a discretization of space time by internally flat building blocks  in this case simplices .",
    "the metric information is encoded in the lengths of the edges of these building blocks .",
    "curvature arises as flat simplices might be glued together along a hinge  an edge in three dimensions and a triangle in four dimensions  such that the sum of the angles contributed by the glued simplices around this hinge differs from @xmath88 .",
    "this difference is the so  called deficit angle and measures the scalar curvature .",
    "flat space solutions can be constructed easily by triangulating flat space . to this end one",
    "just has to distribute a set of points and to connect all these points with ( geodetic , that is straight ) edges so that one obtains a triangulation .",
    "the lengths of these edges are induced by the embedding flat geometry .",
    "having one such flat triangulation with a determined set of edge lengths , one can obtain another flat triangulation ( with a different set of edge lengths ) by displacing any vertex of the first triangulation in the embedding flat geometry .",
    "this displacement will by definition not change the flatness of the geometry .",
    "also it only changes the lengths of the edges adjacent to the vertex  hence the change is only local and will in general not affect the boundary data .",
    "in this sense we obtain many gauge equivalent solutions  for every internal vertex we obtain @xmath2 gauge parameters , where @xmath2 is the space  time dimension .",
    "basically we obtain gauge symmetries for the case of flat solutions as these can be mirrored exactly in the discretized theory .",
    "the same applies for homogeneously curved solutions ( if a cosmological constant is present ) if one uses homogeneously curved building blocks @xcite . also here the gauge symmetries correspond to vertex displacements .",
    "the gauge symmetries of the flat geometry survive if one considers linearized regge calculus on such a flat background @xcite .",
    "the gauge modes correspond to the infinitesimal change of the lengths variables induced by the displacement of vertices embedded in the flat background geometry .",
    "however this invariance is broken to higher order @xcite , that is the second order gauge modes do appear in the higher than second order ( potential ) terms .",
    "this makes a perturbative expansion in general inconsistent : quantum mechanically one has to face the problem that modes appear in the higher potential terms for which however a propagator is missing .",
    "even classically it turns out @xcite that the higher order equations lead to non  linear consistency equations for the perturbative lower order ( gauge ) variables , including the one at zeroth order .",
    "that is the positions of the vertices in the flat background geometry , which is left to be arbitrary for the linearized theory , is fixed by the higher order perturbative equations .",
    "one way to avoid these problems is to improve the action order by order . in this way",
    "one pushes the gauge breaking terms to higher and higher order . although the linearized regge action features ( linearized ) gauge symmetries , one even has to start with the improvement of the quadratic order of the action ( defining the linearized theory ) . the reason is , that gauge breaking at third order is related to the non - invariance of the second order hamilton ",
    "jacobi functional of the theory under vertex displacements , see @xcite . in other words the linearized theory although being invariant under infinitesimal vertex displacements is not invariant under finite vertex displacements and its predictions still depend on the underlying lattice",
    ".    what kind of diffeomorphism symmetry can one expect for the full non  perturbative perfect action ?",
    "as this action should represent the pull  back of continuum physics to the lattice , we can describe the potential solutions of such an action .",
    "assume that as in regge calculus the basic variables are the lengths of the edges of some underlying triangulation .",
    "then one way to obtain lattice representations of continuum solutions is to choose a triangulation of a given solution , i.e. to embed vertices in this solution and to connect these by geodetic edges .",
    "the geometry of the continuum solutions prescribes the length of these edges , determining a particular configuration of the lattice theory .",
    "obviously there is a huge set of ambiguities in this procedure , namely the choice of how and where to embed the vertices into the continuum solutions .",
    "this is where a perfect lattice theory should lead to gauge equivalent solutions .",
    "that is , also non ",
    "perturbatively , one would expect vertex displacements as remnants of the continuum diffeomorphism symmetry .",
    "this can also be understood from the construction of the solutions described above : the choice of where to embed the vertices can be parametrized with the choice of coordinates .",
    "the change of coordinates under a transformation would thus induce a change of the embedded vertices and hence in general of the edge lengths describing the discrete solution .",
    "let us turn to the general problem of coarse graining theories with gauge symmetries .",
    "conceptually this is not a problem at the classical level , as we can still apply the definition ( [ defcg ] ) [ defcg2 ] s= s , i.e. to evaluate the action at an extremum under the conditions that the coarse grained fields @xmath89 are equal to some prescribed values @xmath14 . in general",
    "this extremum will not be unique  due to the gauge symmetries .",
    "but this does not render the coarse grained action ( [ defcg2 ] ) ill  defined , as by definition the values of the action at these gauge related extrema coincide .    note also that gauge symmetries are preserved under coarse graining : if @xmath90 is a family of solutions related by gauge transformations labelled by @xmath91 , then  as coarse grained solutions will be solutions of the coarse grained action ",
    "@xmath92 will be a family of solutions of the coarse grained action . what will in general happen is , that gauge degrees of freedom are absorbed by the coarse graining , i.e. that @xmath92 is a much smaller set of solutions than @xmath90 .    a useful criterion for the choice of the coarse graining map @xmath16 will be that it should preserve the form of the gauge symmetries for the coarse grained action , as will be discussed for the examples below .",
    "this will have the advantage that the ( often geometric determined ) interpretation of the gauge transformations will not change , nor does the form of the gauge invariant variables .",

    "e(l ) = _ e l_e _ e(l ) . now from the first equation of motion ( [ regge3 ] ) it actually follows that @xmath205 is the deficit angle at @xmath200 in the coarse grained triangulation ( which just agrees with the deficit angles of all the edges @xmath198 making up @xmath200 ) .",
    "hence we indeed just obtain again the original regge action ( [ regge1 ] ) as the coarse grained action .",
    "the purpose of this work was to develop some necessary methods , in order to construct discrete actions , that feature continuum ( gauge ) symmetries .",
    "one motivation is to understand how discrete gravity actions with an exact notion of diffeomorphism symmetry could be obtained . as in general relativity diffeomorphism symmetry",
    "is deeply intertwined with the dynamics of the theory , investigation of this problem could shed some light on one of the most important problems in many quantum gravity approaches , namely to show that general relativity emerges in the large scale limit .    the main idea to construct such discrete actions featuring continuum symmetries , is to ` pull back ' continuum dynamics to the lattice .",
    "this can be done via a coarse graining / renormalization approach .",
    "the advantage of this method is that in the long term , the tools developed may also help to derive the large scale limit of discrete quantum gravity theories .",
    "here we took some initial steps in this program .",
    "in particular we formulated how to coarse grain theories with gauge degrees of freedom in a gauge covariant way .",
    "this is particularly important regarding discrete gravity approaches , where there is a notion of diffeomorphism symmetry for the linearized theory , which is however broken at higher order .",
    "thus gauge fixing would be inconsistent , at least to higher order .",
    "furthermore we provided a discrete gravity action and a coarse graining map for gravity , which was motivated by regge calculus and its geometric interpretation . indeed with this choice , there is an obvious interpretation of the gauge degrees of freedom as translation of the vertices in the background geometry , which is preserved under coarse graining .",
    "moreover for 3d gravity , the discrete action is invariant under coarse graining with the coarse graining map provided .",
    "we have only considered free theories  one obvious development is to consider the theory to higher order , where in the case of discrete gravity , diffeomorphism invariance is broken .",
    "thus one could verify or falsify , whether one regains with these methods diffeomorphism symmetry at least on the perturbative level .",
    "numerous other directions for further development are possible , we will just list a few of them :    * if the theories are not topological , the coarse grained actions will in general be non  local . here",
    "it would be interesting to develop a canonical analysis of such non - local theories on the lattice @xcite .",
    "for canonical lattice gravity a long  standing problem is , that the algebra of ( gauge transformation generating ) constraints does not close @xcite .",
    "one possibility is , that to obtain closure of the constraint algebra , one might have to involve canonical formulations of such non  local theories . *",
    "in the course of this work , we have seen that the complexity of the coarse graining process might depend very much on the choice of basic variables .",
    "indeed for general relativity , there exists a plethora of different formulations in the continuum @xcite but also in the discrete @xcite based on different kind of variables . here",
    "it could be very fruitful to see , which formulations are most amenable for coarse graining . since many of the formulations on which spinfoams @xcite are based involve ( second class ) constraints , an interesting problem is to investigate the behavior of such constraints under coarse graining @xcite .",
    "this could also shed some light on the problem , whether degenerate configurations , which play an important role in spin foam formulations @xcite , will be relevant for the large scale dynamics . *",
    "a related question is to consider alternative coarse graining maps , to see how these influence the locality of the coarse grained action @xcite , but also whether these alternative coarse grainings regain ( diffeomorphism ) symmetries .",
    "* for the quantum theory , one would not only need a diffeomorphism invariant discrete action , but also a diffeomorphism invariant measure for the discrete theory .",
    "such a measure can likewise be obtained by coarse graining / renormalization of the partition function @xcite .",
    "this question can even be considered for linearized gravity , however one has to keep some parameters of the triangulation of the flat background geometry as free variables , in order to gain some information on the measure , which will be a function of these parameters . * the actions and partition functions obtained via coarse graining should be explored , in particular with regard to diffeomorphism invariance . here",
    "an interesting more general question is , whether diffeomorphism invariant actions are necessarily fixed points of some coarse graining process , in particular whether these are connected to discretization ( or triangulation ) independence .",
    "if this is the case , the question arises , how this approach , where triangulation independence is obtained via coarse graining , is related to approaches , where triangulation independence is reached via a sum over triangulations @xcite .",
    "bd would like to thank carlo rovelli and james ryan for fruitful discussions about the nature of diffeomorphism symmetries in discrete theories .",
    "here we want to derive geometrically the coarse graining map for the metric variables @xmath157 used in section [ sec : linearizedgravity ] . this map can be obtained by considering a regular ( hyper ) cubical lattice to which we assign as variables the length of the edges .",
    "it would however not be sufficient to have only the lengths of the edges in the @xmath2 coordinate directions to reconstruct the full metric .",
    "rather one has to introduce diagonals @xmath206 , that is edges starting from a vertex @xmath28 and ending at @xmath207 where @xmath208 are the lattice vectors in direction @xmath209 . in three and four dimensions it is also necessary to introduce further edges , namely body diagonals along @xmath210 and in four dimensions hyperbody diagonals along @xmath211 , to obtain a regular triangulation into simplices .",
    "but the lengths of these additional edges are subject to a trivial dynamics in linearirized regge calculus , that is these variables can be ignored @xcite . indeed as we will see below the lengths of the edges @xmath212 along all the directions @xmath213 together with the lengths of the diagonals @xmath214 along the directions @xmath215 are sufficient to find all the lattice metric components @xmath216 .    to this end",
    "we just need to consider how the lengths of the edges are computed from the metric @xmath217 [ metric1 ] l_a^2&=&e_a g e_a= g_aa + l_ab^2 & = & ( e_a+e_b ) g ( e_a+e_b ) = g_aa + 2 g_ab + g_bb",
    ".    we will consider perturbations for the length variables and for the metric variables [ metric2 ] l_a = l^(0)_a(1 + _ a ) , l_ab= l^(0)_ab(1 + _ ab ) , g_ab = g_ab^(0)+h_ab where the background values are @xmath218 and @xmath219 with @xmath128 the lattice constant . using the expansion ( [ metric2 ] ) in the relations ( [ metric1 ] ) and keeping only terms to first order in @xmath220 we obtain [ metric3 ] h_aa=2a^2 _ a , h_ab = a^2(2_ab- _ a - _ b ) .",
    "the coarse graining of the length variables is straightforward : the lengths of a coarse grained edge @xmath221 should be given by the sum of the lengths @xmath222 , respectively , of all the edges forming this new coarse grained edge .",
    "hence we obtain for the coarse graining of the perturbation variables @xmath223 [ metric4 ] _ a ( x ) = _ z=0^l-1 _ a(lx+ze_a ) , _ ab ( x ) = _ z=0^l-1 _ ab(lx+z(e_a+e_b ) ) . using the relations ( [ metric3 ] ) on both sides of these equations leads to the following coarse graining map for the perturbative metric variables [ metric4b ] h_aa & = & l _ z=0^l-1 h_aa ( lx+ze_a ) + h_ab & = & l_z=0^l-1 ( h_ab+ h_aa+ h_bb)(lx+ z(e_a+e_b ) ) + & & - l_z=0^l-1 h_aa(x+ze_a ) -l_z=0^l-1 h_bb(lx+ ze_b ) . defining the coarse graining matrix @xmath224 by [ metric5 ] h_ab(x)&=&_c , d _ x b_abcd(x , x)h_ab(x ) we obtain for its fourier transformation [ metric6 ] b_abcd(p , p)&:= & _ x , x e^-2i b_abcd(x , x)e^2i the following result [ metric7 ] b_abcd(p , p)=^(n ) ( p - p ) ( & & _ ab_cd _ ac + + & & ( 1-_ab)_cd ( _ ac ( - ) + _ bc ( - ) ) + + & & ( 1-_ab)(1-_cd ) ( _ ac_bd+_ad_bc ) ) , where we abbreviated @xmath170 and similarly for @xmath171 .",
