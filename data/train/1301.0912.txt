    "zurek mechanism@xcite ( kzm ) aims at the description of kinetically governed phase transitions induced by rapid decrease of the temperature .",
    "kzm may be didactically expressed as the division of the transition into three stages , with underlying postulates for each stage . during the initial stage",
    "the system is in a high symmetry phase ; it explores lower symmetry states due to thermal fluctuations , but is symmetric on the average .",
    "the system is able to follow the change of the temperature and may be considered to remain in thermal equilibrium . during the intermediate stage the critical temperature is crossed . during this stage",
    "the system is sluggish , so that its final state will be very similar to the initial state . in the final stage",
    "several lower symmetry states are long lived ; the selected state will have symmetry properties that are determined by the state that was randomly occupied by the system when it entered the second stage .",
    "kzm has been tested by many experiments and simulations , and various degrees of agreement have been obtained",
    ". we will be interested in the case of systems with loop topology.@xcite in this paper we consider a superconducting loop cooled at a fast rate from slightly above to slightly below its critical temperature , in the absence of applied magnetic field , and investigate the possibilities for spontaneous emergence of a permanent supercurrent .",
    "the first postulate specifies the temperature at which the system becomes sluggish :    the crossover from the initial to the intermediate stage occurs when @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath5 is the reduced distance from the critical temperature , @xmath6 is the derivative of @xmath7 with respect to time , and @xmath8 is the relaxation time of the system .",
    "the following postulates are formulated here for the case of a system with loop geometry , described by a complex order parameter .",
    "the moment at which @xmath9 will be taken as @xmath10 and the moment at which the system passes from the initial to the intermediate stage will be denoted as @xmath11 .",
    "[ p2 ] we denote by @xmath12 the coherence length of the order parameter at @xmath11 and by @xmath13 the perimeter of the loop . the behavior of the system can be estimated by enviewing it as if it were divided into @xmath14 pieces , such that in each piece the phase of the order parameter is uniform , and such that there is no correlation between the phases in different pieces .",
    "let us denote by @xmath15 the phase difference between regions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it follows from postulate  [ p2 ] that the variance of this phase difference is @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the phase difference accumulated around the loop .",
    "since @xmath20 for @xmath21 , if we ignore the constraint that @xmath22 has to be an integer multiple of @xmath23 , we obtain _ c^2=^2/3 .",
    "[ vartetc ] it turns out that the constraint has no effect . taking the @xmath15 s uncorrelated for @xmath24 and picking @xmath25 as the phase difference with the smallest absolute value such that @xmath26 is integer , eq .",

    "[ varn ]    the winding number can be regarded as a topological invariant that remains unchanged for @xmath29 .",
    "this postulate is far from plausible .",
    "although @xmath28 is a discrete variable , there is no impediment for a continuous passage of the order parameter to a different winding number , provided that it vanishes at some point .",
    "the idea behind postulate 3 is that during the period @xmath30 the system is sluggish and its order parameter practically does not change , and after @xmath31 there is an energy barrier between states with different winding number .",
    "this statement would be true if at @xmath31 the order parameter were close to local equilibrium , which most probably will not be the case .",
    "since the order parameter is random and nearly vanishes at @xmath11 , the same is true at @xmath31 , and we have no good reason to expect a considerable energy barrier for the passage to a different winding number .",
    "postulate 3 has been amended in later publications ( e.g.  ref .  ) .",
    "the revised claim is that ( i ) there is a time @xmath32 at which the order parameter shoots up sharply ; ( ii ) @xmath28 remains constant after @xmath32 ; ( iii ) @xmath33 and @xmath32 is of the order of @xmath34 ; ( iv ) since the coherence lengths are the same for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , it follows from ( i)(iii ) that the scaling properties of the system will be the same as if postulate 3 were true .    most of the literature on kzm studies the scaling of the density of defects ( the winding number in our case ) with the rate at which the system is cooled . for this purpose ,",
    "postulate 1 is of central importance . in the present study we will first consider the case in which the system is cooled at an ideally fast rate and",
    "will check the applicability of postulates 2 and 3 ; verification of postulate 1 will be postponed to sec .",
    "a simple approach for the description of the dynamics of a superconducting sample is the time - dependent ginzburg  landau model ( tdgl ) , with the addition of langevin terms that bring thermal fluctuations into account ( e.g.  ref .  ) ; in the case of 1d systems , simplifications are possible.@xcite we assume that the magnetic field induced by the current around the loop is negligible and write the ginzburg ",

    "as discussed in ref .  , in a superconducting loop there is a competition between the fluctuations of the order parameter and those of the gauge field , and it is not obvious in general which of them will dominate . if gauge fields are to play a dominant role , the infinite range and the speed with which different sections of the loop can influence one another could prove significant .",
    "we should clarify that , in the case of the 1d loop we are considering , the induced magnetic flux for winding number @xmath28 is much less than the fluxoid @xmath224 .",
    "moreover , except for the case of sec .",
    "[ infll ] , the magnetic field is completely neglected .",
    "the effect of the electromagnetic potential @xmath42 is not the creation of magnetic fluctuations in space , but rather of fluctuations of the electric field along the loop .    in this section we set @xmath225 in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) , and proceed exactly as before .",
    "the variances of the winding number for equilibrium distributions are still described by fig .",
    "[ uniform ] and @xmath226 close to @xmath0 .",
    "the probabilities for decays of states with non zero winding number are still fairly described by fig .",

    "[ post1 ] are our results for @xmath212 as a function of @xmath227 . as in the case of sec .",
    "[ rate ] , we obtain a universal function , independent of the loop parameters . the blue line is a fit to the form @xmath216 . as opposed to the case of sec",
    ".  [ rate ] , the increase of @xmath212 with the quenching rate does not seem to saturate for @xmath228 , suggesting that the fluctuations of the electromagnetic field are responsible for this saturation trend .    in the absence of electromagnetic fluctuations the final winding numbers are larger than in their presence .",
    "this means that these fluctuations are more effective on destroying metastable states than on creating them .",
    "we have analyzed the probabilities for final states with permanent currents when a 1d superconducting loop is quenched through its critical temperature in the absence of magnetic flux .",
    "the analysis was based on the time - dependent ginzburg  landau model with thermal fluctuations .",
    "the predictions of the kibble  zurek mechanism ( kzm ) are obtained in the appropriate limits . sufficiently above @xmath0 , for coherence lengths @xmath74 that are short compared to @xmath72 , the phase of the order parameter remains essentially constant over lengths comparable to @xmath74 . a large fraction of the  topological defects \" that are present immediately after the temperature is abruptly lowered below @xmath0 decay during a lapse of time of the order of @xmath229 , but most metastable states that survive this stage conserve their winding number in the following .",
    "the requirement of a sort of  incubation time \" before the winding number becomes locked was also noticed in ref .  .",
    "equation ( [ kzn2 ] ) is obeyed for @xmath230 , with the mean field critical exponents @xmath214 and @xmath215 . for shorter quenching times , the increase of @xmath219 with the quenching rate is somewhat slower .    when fluctuations of the gauge field are ignored , the values of @xmath219 increase , and eq .  ( [ kzn2 ] ) is obeyed over a wider range of quenching rates .",
    "we have not investigated the influence of the self inductance on the dependence of @xmath219 on the quenching rate .",

    "we consider a uniform loop and distinguish between the cases above and below the critical temperature .      in this case",
