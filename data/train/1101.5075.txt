    "entanglement is an essential resource in almost all quantum computing and informational processing tasks . in certain quantum computing tasks , however , there are still quantum advantages with the absence of entanglement .",
    "one typical example is the deterministic quantum computation with one qubit ( dqc1 ) @xcite in which the _ quantum discord _ , introduced by ollivier and zurek @xcite and independently by henderson and vedral @xcite ,",
    "is proposed to be responsible for the quantum speedup @xcite . ever since , the quantum discord , a nonnegative number quantifying all the quantum correlations in a state beyond the entanglement , has attracted much interest in quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "subsequently the operational meaning of the quantum discord has established firmly its status as an essential resource @xcite .",
    "quantum discord provides a measure for the quantum correlation beyond entanglement , which is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the von neumann entropy , @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , and the minimum is taken over all possible positive operator - valued measures @xmath7 on subsystem @xmath5 @xcite with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the minimum can also be taken over all the von neumann measurements @xcite , and these two definitions coincide in the case of zero quantum discord .",
    "in general , the quantum discord is asymmetric , i.e. , @xmath10 is not equal to @xmath11 which is obtained by measuring subsystem @xmath6 . for simplicity",
    "we only consider @xmath10 in the following .",
    "though almost all quantum states have nonzero quantum discord @xcite , states with vanishing quantum discord find numerous applications in fundamental concepts in addition to its initial motivation in pointer states @xcite . for examples , the vanishing quantum discord is related to the complete positivity of a map @xcite and the local broadcasting of the quantum correlations @xcite . for a given bipartite state in a finite - dimensional system ,",
    "sufficient conditions as well as necessary and sufficient conditions for nonzero quantum discord have been proposed @xcite in the form of local commutativity , strong positive partial transpose , etc .",
    "specially rahimi and saitoh @xcite have introduced an example of nonlinear witness for the nonzero quantum discord .",
    "all these criteria , however , require some knowledge of the quantum states and have nothing to say about the nonzero values of the quantum discord .",
    "the problem of witnessing the nonzero quantum discord of an unknown state remains open .    in this paper we shall propose a single observable to detect the nonzero quantum discord of a completely unknown state provided that we have four copies of the state .",
    "the expectation value of this observable provides not only a necessary and sufficient condition for nonzero quantum discord in @xmath0 systems and a necessary condition in higher finite - dimensional bipartite systems , but also quantitative lower bounds for the quantum discord and the geometric measure of quantum discord .",
    "our observable can be experimentally measured in exactly the same easy manner as that of the entanglement witness , and moreover a quantum circuit is designed so that its expectation value can be easily determined via four simultaneous local qubit - measurements .",
    "it turns out that , similarly to entanglement witnesses , there is a hermitian observable @xmath12 that detects perfectly the nonzero quantum discord without state tomography and provides a lower bound for the quantum discord . to construct this observable",
    "we note firstly an important lesson learned from @xcite that a linear witness can never detect nonzero discord of a separable state . therefore nonlinear witnesses should be used to detect quantum discord and the expectation values of an observable on multi copies of a state",
    "is naturally nonlinear .",
    "secondly , since the quantum discord is invariant under local unitary ( lu ) transformations , the observable witnessing the quantum discord should also be lu - invariant .    in general , the polynomial lu invariants of degree @xmath13 for a bipartite given quantum state @xmath14",
    "is given by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a tensor product of some permutation operator acting on copies of subsystem @xmath5 and some permutation operator of subsystem @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "for later use we introduce the following four lu invariants @xmath17 @xmath18 of order 4 where @xmath19 in which we have denoted by @xmath20 the swapping operator acting on the @xmath21-th and the @xmath22-th copies of subsystem @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "our discord witness reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the dimension of @xmath25 and obviously @xmath26 is also an lu - invariant .",

    "_ similarly to eq .",
    "( [ lower ] ) , one can also present a nontrivial lower bound for the geometric measure of quantum discord using the expectation value of @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath37 @xmath38 is the geometric measure of quantum discord defined as @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the set of zero - discord states and @xmath41 $ ] is the square norm in the hilbert - schmidt space .    _ remark 3 . _",

    "after the hadamard gate applied to the control qubit and a control @xmath63-qubit unitary gate @xmath65 , the output state becomes @xmath66 by making the measurements in the eigenbasis of @xmath67 and @xmath68 on the control qubit , the quantum circuit provides the normalized trace of @xmath65 , @xmath69 , since the expectation values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 give estimates for the real and imaginary parts of @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "there is strong evidence that dqc1 task can not be simulated efficiently using classical computation @xcite , and the quantum discord has been proposed as a figure of merit for characterizing the resources present in this computational model @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that the output state ( [ final ] ) is a natural @xmath0 state under the bipartite split between the control qubit and the collection of @xmath63 qubits .",
    "therefore , we can derive an explicit condition for characterizing the correlations in the output state using the theorem .",
    "after some algebra , we have @xmath71 according to our theorem , @xmath72 if and only if @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath74 or @xmath75 for some real @xmath76 , which is equivalent to the result shown in ref . @xcite .    on the other hand , if @xmath77 and @xmath78 , using eq .",
