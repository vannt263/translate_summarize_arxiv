    "the casimir force @xcite between uncharged metallic plates attracts considerable attention as a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum vacuum @xcite . with the development of microtechnologies that routinely allow control of the separation between bodies smaller than 1 @xmath0",
    "the force became a subject of systematic experimental investigation .",
    "modern high precision experiments were made using different techniques such as torsion pendulum @xcite , atomic force microscope ( afm ) @xcite , microelectromechanical systems ( mems ) @xcite and different geometrical configurations : sphere - plate @xcite , plate - plate @xcite , crossed cylinders @xcite . in most cases the bodies were covered with gold evaporated or sputter deposited to the thickness of 100 - 200 nm . in the only plate - plate configuration experiment @xcite the bodies were covered with chromium .",
    "one of the bodies was covered with copper in the mems experiment @xcite .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) roughness of deposited metal films was varied from 30 - 40 nm as in the mems experiments @xcite to nearly atomically flat surfaces as in the crossed cylinders experiment @xcite .",
    "relatively low precision , 15% , in the force measurement was reached for the plate - plate configuration @xcite because of the parallelism problem . in the torsion pendulum experiment",
    "@xcite the force was measured with the accuracy of 5% . in the experiments @xcite",
    "it was found with 1% precision . in the most precise up to date experiment @xcite the improvement",
    "was achieved due to the use of the dynamical method @xcite .",
    "additionally the change in the resonance frequency of the mechanical oscillator was measured using the phase jump instead of the resonance behavior of the amplitude . in this way",
    "the force between gold and copper covered bodies was found with a relative accuracy of 0.25% .    to draw any conclusion from the experiments one has to predict the force theoretically with the precision comparable with the experimental errors .",
    "it is a real challenge to the theory because the force is material dependent ; it is very difficult to fix the material properties since different uncontrolled factors are involved . in its original form , the casimir force @xcite    @xmath1    was calculated between the ideal metals .",
    "it depends only on the fundamental constants and the distance between the plates @xmath2 .",
    "the force between real materials was found for the first time by lifshitz @xcite .",
    "the material properties enter in the lifshitz formula via the dielectric function @xmath3 at imaginary frequencies @xmath4 .",
    "correction to the expression ( [ fc ] ) is significant at the separations between bodies smaller than 1 @xmath0 . to calculate the force the lifshitz formula is used with the optical data taken from the handbooks @xcite .",
    "the data are available only up to some low - frequency cutoff @xmath5 . for good metals such as @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 the data",
    "can be extrapolated to the lower frequencies @xmath9 with the drude dielectric function    @xmath10    which includes two parameters : the plasma frequency @xmath11 and the relaxation frequency @xmath12 .",
    "these parameters can be extracted from the optical data at the lowest accessible frequencies .",
    "the exact values of the drude parameters are very important for the precise evaluation of the force .",
    "when two plates are separated by the distance @xmath2 , one can introduce a characteristic imaginary frequency @xmath13 of electromagnetic field fluctuations in the gap .",
    "the important fluctuations are those that have frequency @xmath14 . for @xmath15",
    "the characteristic frequency is in the near infrared region .",
    "this qualitative consideration is often continued to the real frequency domain @xcite with the real characteristic frequency @xmath16 . because @xmath17 is in the near infrared",
    "it is stated that the low - frequency behavior of the dielectric function is not significant for the casimir force .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this consideration is wrong @xcite .",
    "the force depends on the dielectric function at imaginary frequencies @xmath3 . with the help of the dispersion relation @xmath18",

    "this aspect is carefully discussed in this paper .",
    "two different procedures to get the drude parameters were discussed in the literature . in the first approach @xcite the plasma frequency",
    "was fixed independently on the optical data assuming that each atom gives one conduction electron ( for @xmath24 ) with the effective mass equal to the mass of free electron .",

    "( [ drude ] ) . when the best data from ref .",
    "@xcite were used the result @xcite was close to that found by the first approach , but using different sources for the optical data collected in ref .",
    "@xcite an appreciable difference was found @xcite .",
    "this difference was attributed to the defects in the metallic films which appear as the result of the deposition process .",
    "it was indicated that the density of the deposited films is typically smaller and the resistivity is larger than the corresponding values for the bulk material . however , it was difficult to make definite conclusions without analysis of significant amount of the data on the deposited metallic films . in this paper",
    "this analysis is performed and it is proven that there is a genuine sample dependence of optical properties of gold .",
    "first of all it means that the gold films prepared in different ways will have different drude parameters .",
    "the change in the optical properties will lead to the sample dependence of the casimir force , which is carefully investigated in this paper .",
    "the main ideas were outlined before @xcite with the conclusion that the absolute value of the casimir force between gold films is of about 2% smaller than between bulk material at the smallest separations investigated in the experiments @xcite .",
    "here we come to the same conclusion but present much more details and facts .",

    "the equation ( [ k - k ] ) shows that the casimir force is intimately connected with the dissipation in the material given by @xmath46 that is , indeed , the result of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( see discussion in ref .",

    "characterization is as important as the measurement of the force itself .    while there is no direct optical data for the films used in the casimir force experiments",

    "this upper limit was discussed in sec .",

    "much more detailed analysis of the dielectric function of perfect single crystalline gold carried out in this paper supports this conclusion .",
    "let us be more precise .",

    "one can compare @xmath294 with the upper limit on the force which was discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] . for the reduction factor",
    "it was found @xmath295 that is equivalent to the force @xmath296 .",
    "the difference @xmath297 should be compared with the experimental error that was estimated as @xmath298 @xcite .    due to error in the absolute separation @xmath299 @xcite the first experimental point",
    "could correspond to @xmath300 . in this case",
    "the upper limit is @xmath301 and @xmath302 .",
    "it should be stressed that the theoretical uncertainty in the force because of @xmath303 is @xmath304 /f\\left ( 63\\,nm\\right ) = 4.1\\%$ ] .",
    "it is considerably larger than the claimed 1% agreement between the theory and experiment @xcite .",
    "this problem has been already emphasized before @xcite . even for @xmath300",
    "the upper limit is still @xmath305 smaller than the measured force .    in reality",
    "the theoretical force should be smaller than the upper limit due to deviation of the film optical properties from the properties of bulk material .",
    "the smallest volume fraction of voids was estimates in sec .",

    "it reduces the absolute value of the force at @xmath255 on 1.8% .",
    "the electron scattering on the grain boundaries reduces the force additionally . as the largest possible value of the mean grain size for the unannealed @xmath306-thick gold film we take @xmath307 . according to eq .",

    "the minimal reduction of the force due to finite grain size is estimated then as 0.5% .",
    "therefore , in the very best situation the theoretical force is expected to be smaller than @xmath310 or @xmath311 for @xmath300 .",

    "recently the result of the afm experiment @xcite has been reanalyzed @xcite .",

    "smaller value was found for the standard deviation @xmath312 . the only point for the force",
    "was reported : at @xmath300 the mean force was @xmath313 . both position and the force are smaller than that in ref . @xcite but the authors did not make any comment in this respect .",
    "the problem with the uncertainty of absolute separation @xmath303 @xcite was dismissed on the basis that the experiment is in a good agreement with the theory .",
    "the theoretical result for the force was found as in ref .",
    "@xcite using the handbook data and the drude parameters @xmath26 , @xmath27 to extrapolate to the low frequencies .",
    "we have seen in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] that this procedure gives the force very close to the upper limit .",
    "the films used in the experiments should have different drude parameters . in this respect",
    "the authors @xcite stated that @xmath11 is determined by the properties of the elementary cell which can not be influenced by the sample quality .",
    "this statement is wrong because , as shows eq .",
    "( [ omp ] ) , @xmath11 depends on the concentration of the conduction electrons which , indeed , depends on the sample quality .",
    "the voids will reduce the electron concentration in the sample .",
    "even more confusing is the discussion of the sample dependence of @xmath12 .",
    "the authors introduce not imaginary but real characteristic frequency @xmath314 and assume that this frequency gives the main contribution to the force . as was discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] low frequencies @xmath315 give the main contribution to the dispersion integral ( [ k - k ] ) for @xmath316 .",
    "this fact was already stressed in a number of publications @xcite . because of this mistake the authors @xcite took into account some minor effects in the near infrared like electron - electron scattering that gave quadratic frequency dependence of the relaxation frequency @xcite but missed very important and well established effect like significant increase of the film resistivity in comparison with the bulk material .",
    "the same analysis can not be done for the latest mems experiment @xcite mainly because of huge roughness correction .",
    "in contrast with the afm experiment , where the roughness correction was smaller than 0.5% , in this experiment the roughness correction is as large as 25% . one can hardly believe that the calculations based on the local separation @xcite can be true for the shape dependent casimir force with the precision on the level of 1% . in the experiment @xcite one of the plates",
    "was covered with copper but in the present paper an extensive analysis of gold was made .",
    "for this reason one can say only that the sample effect should reduce the force on the level of 2% .",
    "it is much larger than the declared experimental errors .",
    "the roughness correction and sample effects do not allow us to support the conclusion @xcite on the possibility to distinguish between different approaches to the temperature correction .",
    "in this paper we analyzed the sample dependence of the casimir force .",
    "it was already noted @xcite that the optical properties of metallic films used to measure the force can deviate significantly from the bulk material but here , for the first time , serious analysis of the effect based on the facts about gold films was undertaken .",
    "it was stressed that the behavior of the dielectric function of a metal in the far infrared , where direct optical data are inaccessible , is crucial for the precise evaluation of the force .",
    "the casimir force depends on the dielectric function @xmath82 connected with the observable function @xmath57 via the dispersion relation ( [ k - k ] ) . because @xmath145 is large at low frequencies , the far infrared range gives the most significant contribution in @xmath3 and , therefore , in the force .",
    "for example , at @xmath317 the contribution of the real frequency domain @xmath318 to @xmath319 was estimated as 75% .",
    "sample dependence of the optical properties of gold films was discussed in sec .",
    "the data for 40 years of investigations have been collected and analyzed .",
    "these data clearly showed that significant difference between samples can not be explained by the experimental errors and had to be attributed to genuine sample dependence of the optical properties .",
    "the mechanisms of this dependence have been clarified in the literature .",
    "variation of @xmath57 in the visible range was connected with the volume fraction of voids @xmath133 in the films .",
    "the void fraction is especially significant in unannealed films . for the best unannealed films which start to grow epitaxially on @xmath129 substrate @xmath133",
    "was estimated as 4% but in the worst cases it could be more than 20% .",
    "the fraction of voids is very important for the casimir force because it defines the precise value of the plasma frequency .",
    "the concentration of conduction electrons in the sample decreases with the increase of @xmath133 and , as the result , @xmath11 decreases .",
    "analysis of the data available in the infrared range revealed the same tendency of the dependence on the sample preparation procedure .",
    "it was demonstrated that at @xmath158 the data for real and imaginary parts of @xmath320 could be reasonably well described with the drude model .",
    "the fitting procedure allowed one to find the effective drude parameters for the investigated samples ( see table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "surprisingly , the handbook data @xcite in the range @xmath158 taken from the old paper by dold and mecke @xcite happen to be bad .",
    "the best fit gave @xmath321 , @xmath322 .",
    "it means that the films were poorly prepared and were full of voids and defects for the electron scattering . on the other hand bulk @xmath159 and well annealed",
    "gold films demonstrated much better characteristics close to that typically used for the calculation of the casimir force @xcite : @xmath323 , @xmath27 .",
    "it was stressed that the force was measured between unannealed films for which one can hardly expect that the effective drude parameters coincide with that for the bulk material .",
    "however , using the `` ideal '' dielectric function of gold one can establish the upper limit on the casimir force . this dielectric function",
    "was carefully described in sec .",

    "@xcite explains the coincidence of the forces .",
    "thus , the result of ref .",
    "@xcite should be considered rather as the upper limit on the force than as the force between real films .",
    "the expected deviations of the force from the case of perfect single crystalline gold were analyzed in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] . an appreciable correction to the casimir force",
    "was found due to the presence of voids in the film .",
    "even for the smallest fraction of voids , @xmath253 , the relative correction to the absolute value of the force in the afm experiment @xcite was found to be -1.8% at the smallest separation @xmath255 . for the mems experiment @xcite at @xmath257",
    "the correction was -1.0% .",
    "the other effect that was estimated was influence of the grain boundaries in the film on the electron scattering .",
    "this effect is the main reason for the increase of the film resistivity or the effective relaxation frequency . for the mean grain size of 50 nm ( typical for 100 nm thick film )",
    "the corrections due to the finite grain size were estimated as -0.9% for the afm experiment and -1.2% for the mems experiment at the smallest separations in each case .",
    "both corrections can not be ignored in the experiment where the force was measured with the precision on the level or better than 1% .",
    "a number of additional factors can affect the dielectric function .",
    "not all of them are well understood but one can indicate strains in the film or some internal electron - scattering defects .",
    "all additional effects are expected to reduce the absolute value of the force less than 1% .",
    "the best way to get the precise values of the drude parameters is the direct measurement of the dielectric functions of the film used in a casimir force experiment . the most important frequency range where this function should be known is the infrared range @xmath158 .",
    "it can be done with the infrared spectroscopic ellipsometers .",
