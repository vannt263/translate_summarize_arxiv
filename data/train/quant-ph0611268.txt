    "light has come to play an important role in quantum information sciences , and this puts focus on the ability to prepare and manipulate state vectors of light , i.e. , to restrict the field to a few modes or a single field mode , and to interact exclusively with the selected modes . in optical and microwave cavities ,",
    "many experiments have already been done on pure quantum state manipulation in isolated field modes interacting with single atoms , but there is also an obvious interest to produce traveling light fields with controllable pure state properties .",
    "it is not easy to manipulate quantum states of light , and one very successful strategy has thus been to produce a certain `` easy '' state , and to use a quantum measurement to project this state on the desired quantum state . following the theoretical proposals by dakna et al @xcite ,",
    "see also @xcite , conditioned on appropriate detection events , single- and two - mode squeezed states of light can be transformed into fock states and schrdinger cat - like states , as demonstrated with good fidelity with single mode pulses of light in @xcite .",
    "i.e. , a large number of pulses are generated , and measurements , carried out on each of them with some success probability , ascertain the preparation of the desired state .    a scheme to produce single photon states and other single mode quantum states from a continuous wave field was demonstrated in experiments @xcite , where a photon counter registered the intensity of a small fraction of a beam of squeezed light , causing the remaining beam to have a high single photon amplitude in a well localized mode",
    ". a theoretical analysis of that experiment was given in @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we generalize the approach of @xcite to protocols involving twin beams of light generated from a non - degenerate optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) .",
    "the non - degenerate opo converts photons from a pump beam into pairs of photons in a pair of output modes , and a conditional detection of a single photon in one beam ( which we shall denote the trigger beam ) results in the presence of a single photon in the other beam ( the signal beam ) .",
    "a possible experimental setup is sketched in figure [ setup ] .",
    "in contrast to the pulsed case where the field mode occupied is governed by the pulse shape , in the continuous wave case , the precise temporal modes occupied by the one - photon states in the signal beam have to be specified .",
    "the largest one - photon state fidelities are obtained by choosing the modes optimally , and we present results of a variational procedure and of a numerical optimization .    in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the quantum correlation functions of the twin beams of interest , and we show how the ( schrdinger picture ) quantum state populating an arbitrary field mode can be readily obtained from the ( heisenberg picture ) field correlation functions . in sec .",
    "iii , we present analytical results for the phase space wigner function for the signal state conditioned on a single photo detection event and for the fidelity and rate with which the one - photon states are produced . in sec .",
    "iv , we utilize a variational method to optimize the signal mode function . finally , in sec .",
    "v , we analyze the signal state conditioned on a photo detection event surrounded by an interval with no photo detection events .",
    "vi concludes the paper .",
    "the opo hamiltonian is quadratic in field annihilation and creation operators , and the solution of the time evolution is most easily accomplished by a linear ( bogoliubov ) transformation of each pair of incident field operators at all frequency components .",
    "the state therefore retains the gaussian state character of the vacuum state , i.e. , the joint probability distributions of all the quadrature variables is gaussian .",
    "the state separates in pairs of frequency modes for which the quantum state can be written down explicitly .",
    "since we shall deal with photo detection experiments , we need a representation of the field in time domain , and although it is still a gaussian state , it is now much more complicated , as the field operators at different times are non - trivially correlated .    in so - called type i and type ii opo s ,",
    "photons are created pairwise in two different frequency components and in two different polarization components , respectively .",
    "it is also possible to create photons pairwise in beams propagating in different directions .",
    "alternatively one can combine the single beam squeezed light outputs from two degenerate opo s on a beam splitter , which also produce twin correlated beams , if the opo outputs are squeezed @xmath0 out of phase .",
    "all of these approaches , if restricted to correlations in only one degree of freedom ( polarization , frequency , direction ) , lead to quantum correlations described by the same formal correlation functions for the annihilation and creation operators for the two components , denoted in the following by @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , and are in quite precise models of the opo s given by @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 the parameters in these expressions are the non - linear gain coefficient @xmath9 of the opo , and the decay rate @xmath10 of light in the opo cavity due to leakage through the output mirror .",
    "it is assumed that there is no loss through the other mirror . for fixed @xmath10",
    "we note that @xmath11 is closely related to the mean twin beam intensity @xmath12 .",
    "the modes relevant to the experiment are the mode @xmath13 , in which the trigger detection takes place , and the mode @xmath14 occupied by the produced state , while all other modes are unobserved .",
    "we assume the trigger detection to take place on a timescale much shorter than @xmath15 .",
    "the precise shape of the detected temporal mode is then irrelevant , and we assume @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a short time interval and @xmath18 is the click time for the trigger detection . as discussed in the introduction , the mode function @xmath14 can be chosen arbitrarily ( under the constraint @xmath19 ) , and in particular it can be optimized to achieve maximal fidelity .",
    "the optimal mode function is centered around the trigger detector click time , and from it is to be expected that the temporal extent is of order @xmath15 , which is the time that a photon can spend in the cavity and hence be separated from its partner in the output fields .",
    "we will return to this point in sections iii and iv , but by now we leave @xmath14 unspecified .",
    "the problem thus reduces to the one of characterizing the correlations of the single mode operators @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the trigger detector efficiency , @xmath22 is the signal detector efficiency , and @xmath23 are field operators acting on vacuum , included to ensure appropriate commutator relations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    since the state is gaussian , we immediately know the multi - component wigner function of the trigger and signal mode before conditioning on the trigger detector click event . defining the column vector @xmath26 of quadrature variables @xmath27",
    ", this wigner function is @xmath28 @xmath29 is parameterized by the covariance matrix @xmath30 with elements @xmath31 , which are computed explicitly by use of equations and , the time dependent mode functions @xmath32 , and the two - time correlation functions .",
    "since it follows from that @xmath33 , we have @xmath34 we note that we use the same symbols for quadrature operators and for the corresponding real variable arguments in the wigner function .",
    "we first determine the output state wigner function conditioned on a single trigger detector photo detection event .",
    "we shall assume that the trigger detector produces click events with a rate proportional to the mean photon number , but it does not by its outcome distinguish between different photon number states .",
    "a click detection of such a detector is accompanied by the application of the corresponding field annihilation operator on the quantum state of the system , i.e. , by application of the annihilation operator from the left and its adjoint creation operator from the right on the density matrix , followed by a partial trace over the otherwise unobserved modes .",
    "these operations are mapped to certain differential operators on the wigner function @xcite followed by integration over the corresponding phase space variables .",
    "this results in the following wigner function for the conditioned signal state @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a normalization constant . by partial integration",
    "reduces to @xmath37 where the coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are given in terms of the covariance matrix elements ( [ v11]-[v14 ] ) @xmath41 @xmath42 depends on the signal mode function @xmath14 , the signal detector efficiency @xmath22 , and the non - linear gain coefficient @xmath9 of the opo through @xmath30 , but @xmath42 does not depend on the trigger detector efficiency @xmath21 .",
    "since we condition on a click event , the only effect of an inefficient trigger detector is to reduce the production rate .",
    "figure [ wignerone ] shows @xmath42 for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ( in the next section we prove that this is the optimal mode function for @xmath46 ) .",
    "the fidelity , by which the conditioned wigner function @xmath42 resembles the wigner function for a one - photon state @xmath47 is @xmath48 and for the wigner function in figure [ wignerone ] we find @xmath49 .    for completeness we present in appendix a analytical results for the wigner function and the one - photon state fidelity for the degenerate opo setup analyzed in @xcite .    , @xmath44 , and @xmath45",
    "the one - photon state fidelity is 0.9921 , and the negativity at the origin is @xmath50 . ]",
    "the optimal signal mode function ( denoted @xmath51 ) obtained from numerical optimization of the one - photon state fidelity is shown in figure [ modeone ] for @xmath44 and different values of @xmath11 .",
    "( the optimization is over all real functions , which will be justified in the next section . )",
    "the tendency is that the width of the mode function decreases , when the beam intensity is increased , and a dip appears on each side of the peak .",
    "however , the difference between the optimal mode function for @xmath52 and for @xmath53 is quite small .     for @xmath53 ( solid line ) , @xmath52 ( dashed line )",
    ", @xmath54 ( dot - dashed line ) , and @xmath55 ( dotted line ) . the signal detector efficiency is @xmath44 . ]",
    "the optimized fidelity is shown in figure [ entwinepsfid ] for @xmath44 and @xmath56 ( solid lines )",
    ". the fidelity decreases with increasing @xmath9 because the two - photon state contribution to the output state increases when the intensity increases .",
    "the effect of reducing @xmath22 from 1 to 0.8 is roughly to reduce the fidelity by 20 % in the small @xmath11 region . for larger @xmath11",
    "the reduction is smaller because the lower efficiency reduces the intensity seen by the detector .",
    "the dashed curves in the figure show the fidelity calculated for the mode function @xmath45 , and it is apparent that this analytical approximation is close to optimal for @xmath57 .",
    "this region is also the most interesting region since the fidelity is low for larger @xmath11 .",
    "mode function in equation ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the curves approaching 1 for small @xmath9 are for perfect detection @xmath44 , and @xmath56 for the curves approaching 0.8 for small @xmath9 ]    the production rate @xmath59 ( i.e. the trigger detector click rate ) is @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the probability to observe a click in the trigger mode function .",
    "we assume that @xmath62 , which is valid if @xmath17 is small compared to the mean temporal distance between the photons in the trigger beam .",
    "the probability to observe a click in the trigger mode is then the expectation value of the number of photons in that mode , and hence @xmath63 figure [ rate ] shows the production rate as a function of @xmath11 for @xmath64 .",
    "the rate decreases when @xmath11 decreases and is zero when @xmath53 , and hence , to achieve an acceptable production rate , @xmath11 needs to be sufficiently large .",
    "however , according to figure [ entwinepsfid ] , this limits the fidelity . in sec .",
    "v we analyze the possibility to reduce this problem by conditioning on clicks surrounded by intervals with no click detection events , but first we consider the mode function optimization in greater detail .     versus @xmath11 for @xmath64 . ]",
    "in this section we optimize the signal mode function by analytical variation of the one - photon state fidelity .",
    "we write the signal mode function as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is real . @xmath67 and @xmath66 may be varied independently , and since the constraint @xmath19 does not involve @xmath66 , the optimal choice of @xmath66 fulfils that the variation of @xmath68 vanishes , when @xmath66 is varied , which leads to @xmath69 where @xmath70 note that @xmath71 and @xmath72 depend on the signal mode function through the covariance matrix elements , but they do not depend on time .",
    "note also that @xmath73 and @xmath74 are both proportional to @xmath75 , while @xmath76 is independent of @xmath21 and @xmath17 .    for a general @xmath67",
    "the solution to is @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is an integer that may be different at different times .",
    "is also fulfilled in the limit where @xmath66 varies infinitely fast with time , but this leads to @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and hence @xmath42 reduces to the wigner function for vacuum and @xmath81 .",
    "thus the phase is constant except for possible sign shifts . adding a time independent constant to @xmath66 is equivalent to rotating the signal state wigner function in phase space , but since the desired @xmath82 signal state wigner function depends on @xmath83 and @xmath84 through @xmath85 , it is rotationally symmetric , and hence the fidelity is unchanged by this transformation . consequently , we can choose @xmath86 , and it is thus sufficient to optimize over all real functions .    restricting @xmath14 to be real ,",
    "the constraint is @xmath87 , and this is taken into account by introducing a lagrange multiplier @xmath88 and demanding the variation of @xmath89 to vanish when @xmath14 is varied .",
    "this leads to the following integral equation for the optimal signal mode function @xmath90 for @xmath91 the first term in vanishes , and we have @xmath92 is the optimal zero intensity signal mode function , and for @xmath44 the fidelity is @xmath93 . for @xmath94 , can be used as the starting point for a numerical iteration of . to increase the range of @xmath11 values , where the iteration procedure converges",
    ", we use the mode function @xmath95 in the @xmath96 iteration step , where @xmath97 is the mode function obtained from the @xmath98 step .",
    "@xmath99 is a number between @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and @xmath102 is a normalization constant . using this method we regain the mode functions in figure [ modeone ] .",
    "iii we calculated the one - photon state fidelity for the output state conditioned on a single click event .",
    "conditioning solely on one click event means that we average over all possible outcomes of the trigger detector measurements outside the small time window where the conditioning click occurs .",
    "this method is correct if the trigger detector is turned off outside the conditioning click time window , or if we want to calculate the average fidelity for a large number of produced states where no selection of particular click events ( for instance those with no other clicks nearby ) has taken place .",
    "however , an improvement in fidelity for fixed @xmath11 can be obtained if we only accept clicks that are surrounded by a certain time period @xmath103 with no clicks since this restricts the two - photon and higher photon number state contributions to the produced state .",
    "the fidelity increase depends on the trigger detector efficiency .",
    "if @xmath64 , it is certain that no photons hit the trigger detector during the period @xmath103 if no clicks are registered , and for large @xmath104 the fidelity approaches unity irrespective of the value of @xmath11 ( provided @xmath105 is much smaller than the mean temporal distance between photons in the trigger beam ) . in the opposite limit ,",
    "@xmath106 , a vacuum detection ( i.e. no click ) gives us no information about the produced state , and we regain the results from sec .",
    "iii .    for fixed @xmath11 the conditioning on a no click interval results in a smaller production rate because some clicks are now disregarded , but since the fidelity is increased , we can increase @xmath11 a little while still obtaining a larger fidelity than in sec .",
    "iii , and if @xmath104 is not too large , this leads to a larger production rate . in the region where the rate is limited by the number of photons produced by the source it thus turns out that an increase in production rate for fixed fidelity or an increase in fidelity for fixed production rate can be obtained .    in the following",
    "we first calculate the one - photon state fidelity for the signal state conditioned on one click detection and an arbitrary number of no click detections , and after that we derive an equation for the corresponding production rate .",
    "finally we present and discuss numerical results for the fidelity and the production rate .      to determine the one - photon state fidelity for the produced state conditioned on a click event surrounded by a time interval with no click events , we replace the continuous time argument by a discrete set of box shaped temporal trigger mode functions and assume the trigger detections to take place in these modes .",
    "the @xmath107 vacuum detection modes are labeled by the numbers @xmath108 and are included in the covariance matrix .",
    "the unconditioned wigner function is then @xmath109 where @xmath110 .",
    "we first determine the wigner function for the state conditioned on all the vacuum detections but not the click . a vacuum detection results in a projection of the relevant mode on the vacuum state , which in terms of wigner functions corresponds to multiplication with the vacuum state wigner function @xmath111 followed by integration over the relevant quadrature variables and renormalization .",
    "thus the wigner function @xmath112 for the state conditioned on the @xmath113 vacuum detections is @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a normalization constant . since the vacuum projection is a gaussian operation",
    ", @xmath112 is also a gaussian function .",
    "this means that we can proceed as in section iii if we just replace the covariance matrix for the output mode and the click mode with the covariance matrix @xmath116 corresponding to the gaussian wigner function @xmath112 .",
    "if we write the @xmath117 covariance matrix @xmath118 for the signal mode , the click mode , and the vacuum modes as @xmath119,\\ ] ] where @xmath120 is the @xmath121 covariance matrix for the signal mode and the click mode , and @xmath122 is the covariance matrix for the vacuum modes , it has been proven @xcite that @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the @xmath125 identity matrix .",
    "hence by use of we can immediately calculate the improved fidelity from ( note that the covariance matrix elements that are equal in sec .",
    "iii are changed by equal amounts and are hence still equal ) .",
    "the production rate is @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the probability to detect no click in the @xmath113 vacuum modes and a click in the click mode . to determine @xmath127 we calculate the overlap of the unconditioned source output state with the vacuum state in the @xmath113 vacuum modes and then the expectation value of @xmath128 in the click mode @xmath129 since we consider trigger modes only , the signal mode is not included in the @xmath130 covariance matrix in .",
    "performing the integration we find @xmath131 where we have introduced the following notation : @xmath132 is the @xmath130 identity matrix , @xmath133 is a @xmath130 matrix with elements @xmath134 for @xmath135 and @xmath136 otherwise , @xmath137 is the @xmath138 matrix consisting of all the odd - odd matrix elements of @xmath30 , @xmath139 is an @xmath138 matrix with elements @xmath140 for @xmath141 and @xmath142 otherwise , and @xmath143 means that the first row and the first column of the matrix ( corresponding to the click mode ) have been removed .      in all the numerical calculations in this subsection @xmath44 and @xmath144 . for @xmath54 ( and @xmath64 )",
    "we find @xmath145 , and hence the assumption @xmath62 is valid for the region , where the fidelity is large . even for @xmath146 , @xmath147 is still somewhat smaller than @xmath101 .    .",
    "the trigger detector efficiency is @xmath64 for the dotted line , @xmath148 for the solid line , and @xmath106 for the dashed line , while @xmath54 for all curves . ]",
    "figure [ femtfid ] shows the optimized one - photon state fidelity as a function of the time interval @xmath103 in which we demand no click events to occur .",
    "@xmath103 is chosen symmetrically around the trigger detector click time , i.e. we condition on no clicks from @xmath149 to @xmath150 and from @xmath151 to @xmath152 , since this gives rise to the largest fidelity increase for a given @xmath104 .",
    "the rate and fidelity expressions are , however , also valid for asymmetrical time intervals ( and even for time intervals interrupted with periods where the trigger detector is turned off ) .",
    "as expected the fidelity increases when @xmath104 increases if @xmath153 , and for @xmath64 the fidelity approaches one for large @xmath104 .",
    "for a moderate trigger detector efficiency @xmath148 , the fidelity increase is smaller , but still significant .",
    "the fidelity increase levels off when @xmath104 increases beyond approximately @xmath154 irrespective of the value of @xmath21 .",
    "the reason for this is that the temporal extent of the signal mode function is approximately @xmath155 as is apparent from figure [ femmode ] , which shows the optimal signal mode function for @xmath156 , @xmath54 , and different trigger detector efficiencies . for @xmath106 the mode function",
    "is identical to the @xmath54 mode function in figure [ modeone ] , but when @xmath21 is increased to non - zero values , the mode function approaches the optimal @xmath53 mode function ( the dot - dashed line in the figure ) .",
    "( dotted line ) , @xmath148 ( solid line ) , and @xmath106 ( dashed line ) . @xmath54 and @xmath156 .",
    "the dot - dashed line is the @xmath53 optimal mode function given by . ]     for @xmath156 .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to @xmath64 , while @xmath148 for the solid line .",
    "the dashed line is for @xmath106 , and it is hence identical to the upper ( solid ) curve in figure [ entwinepsfid ] . ]    the optimized one - photon fidelity as a function of @xmath9 for @xmath156 and different values of trigger detector efficiency is plotted in figure [ femepsfidid ] . the dashed curve ( @xmath106 ) is identical to the @xmath157 curve in sec .",
    "iii , so the difference between the solid line and the dashed curve shows the fidelity increase @xmath158 when @xmath104 increases from 0 to 10 for @xmath148 . @xmath158 increases with @xmath9 because the mean temporal distance between the photons in the trigger and the signal beam decreases when @xmath11 increases , and hence it is more likely to have close clicks . the dotted curve in the figure is for perfect trigger detection @xmath64 , and",
    "as expected it is close to unity for all @xmath11 .     as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "the dotted line corresponds to @xmath64 and @xmath156 , while the solid line is for @xmath148 and @xmath156 .",
    "the dashed line is for @xmath148 and @xmath159 . ]",
    "the production rates corresponding to the solid line and the dotted line in figure [ femepsfidid ] are shown in figure [ epsr ] , and the dashed line in figure [ epsr ] is the rate for @xmath157 and @xmath148 .",
    "the production rate vanishes for zero intensity because there are no photons present in the trigger beam in that limit .",
    "also in the large intensity limit the rate approaches zero for @xmath160 .",
    "the reason is that the large photon flux makes it extremely unlikely to observe no clicks during some non - zero time interval .",
    "it is desirable to be on the left side of the maximum of the relevant curve in figure [ epsr ] because the fidelity is a decreasing function of @xmath9 .",
    "hence for @xmath156 and @xmath64 , @xmath11 should be below 0.20 , while for @xmath148 , @xmath11 should be below 0.28 .",
    "the @xmath148 curve is shifted to the right compared to the @xmath64 curve because a lower detector efficiency corresponds to a lower photon flux in the beam .",
    "the maximal rate ( @xmath161 for both curves ) corresponds to a mean temporal distance between accepted clicks of @xmath162 . for @xmath148 the high fidelity region",
    "is @xmath163 . for this region",
    "it is apparent from figure [ epsr ] that the decrease in production rate for fixed @xmath11 is quite small when @xmath104 is increased from 0 to 10 , while figure [ femepsfidid ] shows that the fidelity increase @xmath158 is significant .",
    "in conclusion we have considered conditional single photon state generation from a continuous wave non - degenerate opo .",
    "we have presented explicit analytical expressions for the output state wigner function , the one - photon state fidelity , the production rate , and the optimal zero intensity limit temporal mode function for the signal state .",
    "we have optimized the mode function numerically to achieve maximal fidelity , and from a variational calculation we determined an integral equation for the optimal mode function . by conditioning on clicks surrounded by an interval with no clicks ,",
    "the fidelity was increased for fixed @xmath11 , while the production rate was decreased slightly . however , accepting a smaller fidelity increase by increasing @xmath11 led to a larger production rate if @xmath104 and @xmath11 were not too large .    using our approach ,",
    "it is possible analytically to calculate the output state wigner function conditioned on arbitrary sequences of click detections , vacuum ( i.e. no click ) detections , and no detections ( i.e. detector turned off ) in temporal trigger modes of short duration , and the corresponding production rate can also be determined analytically since both calculations involve integration of products of polynomials and gaussian functions only . from the conditioned output state wigner function it is straightforward to compute the fidelity for arbitrary states in arbitrary output modes .",
    "we are currently working on a generalization of our calculations for the production of single photon states to generation of @xmath164-photon and schrdinger kitten states .",
