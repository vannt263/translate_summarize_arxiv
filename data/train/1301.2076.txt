    "for over two decades , physics oriented approaches have widely been developed to explain different economic processes @xcite ( and refs .",
    "therein ) .",
    "those approaches aim at formulating well fitted unbiased indicators of social and economic phenomena .",
    "one of their key issues is the income of society analysis using methods of statistical physics .",
    "the main goal of this economic issue is to unravel and describe mechanisms of societies enrichment or impoverishment .",
    "the first successful attempt in this socio - economic field was made by the legendary economist and sociologist vilfredo pareto @xcite .",
    "he demonstrated that the distribution functions of individual incomes in different countries within stable economy are universal being manifested by a power law .",
    "this law is called the weak pareto law .",
    "he emphasised that this law could not resemble the distribution functions obtained if the gain and accumulation of income were random . as a possible origin of this law ,",
    "pareto indicated a self - similarity structure of societies .",
    "pareto s economic discoveries initiated attempts of analytical descriptions of incomes of the societies and inspired an avalanche of related research works @xcite . among them , particularly significant are those of the economist robert gibrat @xcite .",
    "he found that the complementary cumulative distribution function of the pareto distribution is insufficient to describe empirical data within the whole range of the income . trying to find a functional form that could account for these data",
    ", he proposed a rule called the rule of proportionate growth @xcite ( see below for details ) .",
    "furthermore , the income of societies was analysed by david champerowne , who constructed a stochastic model simulating the pareto power law @xcite and also by benoit mandelbrot who described several useful properties of random variables subjected the pareto distribution @xcite .    in the recent decade",
    ", a large number of studies were performed aiming at constructing of models , which ( to some extend ) would well replicate the observed complementary cumulative distribution functions of individual incomes . among them ,",
    "the most significant seems to be the clementi - matteo - gallegati - kaniadakis approach @xcite , the generalized lotka - volterra model @xcite , the boltzmann - gibbs law @xcite , and the yakovenko et al .",
    "model @xcite . very recently ,",
    "a mathematical model similar to that of yakovenko et al . has been developed @xcite .",
    "it involves complex economic justification for microscopic stochastic dynamics of wealth .",
    "however , none of the above attempts to find an analytical description of the income structure solves the principal challenges , which concern :    * the description of the annual household incomes of all society classes ( i.e. the low- , medium- , and high - income society classes ) by a single unified formula and * the problem regarding corresponding complete microscopic ( microeconomic ) mechanism responsible for the income structure and dynamics .",
    "+ in our considerations presented herein , we used boltzmann - gibbs law and yakovenko et al .",
    "model to derive a uniform analytical formula describing income of all three society classes .",
    "in accord with an effort outlined above , we compared the empirical data of the annual household incomes in the european union ( eu ) , including norway and iceland , with predictions of our theoretical approach proposed herein .",
    "this approach is directly inspired by the yakovenko et al .",
    "model . by using the same assumptions , however , we generalised this model to solve the principal challenges ( i ) and ( ii ) indicated above .",
    "we used data records from the eurostat survey on income and living conditions ( eu - silc ) @xcite , by way of example for years 2006 and 2008 @xcite ( containing around @xmath0 and @xmath1 thousand empirical data points , respectively ) .",
    "however , these records contain ( as all other records ) only few data points concerning the high - income society class , i.e. the third region in the plot of the complementary cumulative probability distribution function vs. annual household income .",
    "to consider the high - income society class systematically , we additionally analysed the effective income of billionaires in the eu by using the forbes the world s billionaires rank @xcite .",
    "the term billionaire used herein is equivalent ( as in the us terminology ) to the term multimillionaire used in the european terminology . since we consider wealth and income of billionaires in euros , we recalculated us dollars to euros by using the mean exchange rate at the day of construction of the forbes the world s billionaires rank .",
    "we were able to consider incomes of three society classes thanks to the following procedure .",
    "* firstly , we selected eu billionaires wealth from the forbes the world s billionaires rank , for instance , for four successive years 2005 to 2008 . * secondly , we calculated the corresponding differences between billionaires wealth for the successive years .",
    "we assumed that their incomes are , in fact , proportional to these differences .",
    "for instance , we calculated the billionaire incomes for year 2006 by taking the difference between their wealth in years 2006 and 2005 .",
    "we made it analogously for year 2008 .",
    "however , we took into account only billionaires who gained effective incomes ( neglecting those , who suffered from income losses ) . * subsequently , having so calculated incomes for the high - income society class , we joined them ( separately for years 2006 and 2008 ) with the corresponding eu - silc datasets . by using so completed datasets",
    ", we then constructed the initial empirical complementary cumulative distribution function for years 2006 and 2008 .",
    "for that , we used the well known weibull recipe ( see below for details ) .",
    "however , this direct approach shows a wide gap of incomes inside the high - income society class resulting in a horizontal line of the complementary cumulative distribution function .",
    "this gap separates the first segment belonging to the high - income society class , consisting of all data points taken from the eu - silc dataset ( only 8 for 2006 and 6 for 2008 ) , from the second segment , consisting of remaining data points ( 76 for 2006 and 96 for 2008 ) , which also belong to the high - income society class but are taken from the forbes dataset . * in the final step , we eliminated this gap by adopting the assumption that the empirical complementary cumulative distribution functions ( concerning the whole society ) have no horizontal segments .",
    "that is , we assumed that statistics of incomes is a continuous function of income .",
    "hence , we were forced to multiply the billionaire incomes from forbes dataset by the properly chosen common proportionality factor .",
    "this factor was equal to @xmath2 for both years , as we assumed the requirement of full overlap of the first ( above mentioned ) segment by the second segment .",
    "this assumption leads to a unique solution ( up to some negligible statistical error ) for this proportionality factor .",
    "we found that this factor was only a slowly - varying function of time ( or years ) .",
    "hence , we received the data record containing already a sufficient number of data points for all society classes , including the high - income society class .",
    "although the forbes empirical data only roughly estimate the wealth of billionaires , they quite well establish the billionaires rank , thus sufficiently justifying our approach .",
    "this is because our purpose is to classify billionaires to concrete universality class rather than finding their total incomes .",
    "our procedure of linking data from two different bases does not violate this universality class .",
    "the basic tool of our analysis is an empirical complementary cumulative distribution function being typical in this context .",
    "we calculated it according to the standard two - step procedure .",
    "for that , first , the income empirical data were ordered according to their rank , i.e. from incomes of the richest households to those of the poorest .",
    "next , in accordance with the well known weibull formula @xcite , we calculated the ratio @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the position of the household in the rank and @xmath5 is the size of the empirical data record .",
    "this ratio directly determines the required fraction of households of the income higher than that related to a given household position @xmath4 in the rank .",
    "the complementary cumulative distribution function obtained that way is sufficiently stable .",
    "furthermore , it does not reduce the size of the output compared to that of the original empirical data record .",
    "let @xmath6 be an influx of income per unit time to a given household .",
    "we treat @xmath6 as a variable obeying stochastic dynamics . then",
    ", we can describe its time evolution by using the nonlinear langevin equation @xcite : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is a drift term and @xmath9 is a white noise , where the coefficient @xmath10 is its @xmath6-dependent amplitude . as we prove below , already white noise is herein sufficient to produce two different power - laws .",
    "obviously , generalisation with respect to power - law noise is also possible and very promising @xcite .",
    "noteworthly , jump effects are important in the financial and social phenomena because they naturally produce power - law tails . however , correspondence between it and stratonovich representations is then no longer trivial .",
    "notably , the above nonlinear stochastic dynamics equation is equivalent to the following fokker - planck ( continuity ) equation for the probability distribution function @xcite : @xmath11 where the flux density of probability ( in the it representation @xcite ) is @xmath12.\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath13 while @xmath14 is the temporal income distribution function .",
    "in general , functions @xmath8 and @xmath15 can be additionally determined by the first and second moment of the income change per unit time , respectively , only if these moments exist .    the equilibrium solution of eq .",
    "( [ rown2a ] ) , @xmath16 , defined by vanishing of @xmath17 @xcite , takes the form : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the lowest household income and @xmath20 is a normalisation factor .",
    "fortunately , both it and stratonovitch representations @xcite give almost the same equilibrium distribution function .",
    "these representations differ only by some preexponential factor .    following the yakovenko et al .",
    "model @xcite , we can assume that changes of income of the low - income society class are independent of the previous income gained .",
    "this assumption is justified because the income of households belonging to this class mainly takes the form of wages and salaries . the stochastic process associated with the mechanism of this kind",
    "is called the additive stochastic process . in this case , coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath15 take , obviously , the form of positive constants @xmath21 this choice of coefficients leads to the boltzmann - gibbs law with the exponential complementary cumulative distribution function @xcite : @xmath22 in equation ( [ rown7 ] ) , distribution function is characterised by a single parameter , i.e. an income temperature @xmath23 , which can be interpreted in this case as an average income per household .    for the medium- and high - income society classes , we can assume ( again following yakovenko et al .",
    "@xcite ) that changes of income are proportional to the income gained so far .",
    "this assumption is also justified because profits go to the medium- and high - income society classes mainly through investments and capital gains .",
    "this type of stochastic process is called the multiplicative stochastic process .",
    "hence , coefficients @xmath8 and @xmath15 obey the proportionality principle of gibrat @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are positive parameters . by using the equilibrium distribution function ( [ rown5 ] ) ,",
    "we arrive in this case to the weak pareto law with the complementary cumulative distribution function @xcite : @xmath27 here , @xmath28 is a scaling factor ( depending on @xmath29 , and @xmath20 ) while @xmath30 is the pareto exponent .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath25 to @xmath26 parameters can directly be determined from the empirical data expressed in the log - log plot ( by using their slopes ) .    as yakovenko et al .",
    "have already found @xcite , the coexistence of additive and multiplicative stochastic processes is allowed . by assuming that these processes are uncorrelated , we get @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "this consideration leads ( together with eq .",
    "( [ rown5 ] ) ) to a significant yakovenko et al .",
    "model with the probability distribution function given by @xmath33^{(\\alpha + 1)/2 } } \\label{rown11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined above . for @xmath36 , eq .",
    "( [ rown11 ] ) becomes the boltzmann - gibbs law while for @xmath37 it becomes the weak pareto law .",
    "notably , the @xmath38 parameter is the crossover income between ranges of additive and multiplicative processes .",
    "based on the yakovenko et al .",
    "( [ rown11 ] ) , the complementary cumulative distribution function can be used to describe income of only low- and medium - income society classes .",
    "however , it does not capture that of the most intriguing high - income society class .",
    "therefore , the goal of our present work is to derive from eq .",
    "( [ rown5 ] ) such a distribution function , which would cover all three ranges of the empirical data records , i.e. low- , medium- , and high - income classes of the society ( including also two short intermediate regions between them ) .",
    "the high - income society class is mainly that composed of the company owners .",
    "hence , besides the weak pareto law , we expect that their household incomes obey ( to a good approximation ) the zipf law @xcite ( the zipf law is the pareto law with the exponent @xmath39 ) . in order to derive the zipf law from eq .",
    "( [ rown5 ] ) , we have to provide , therefore , functions @xmath8 and @xmath15 in the threshold form : @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath32 and @xmath42 .",
    "the threshold parameter @xmath43 can be interpreted as a crossover income between the medium- and high - income society classes . remarkably , both income crossovers @xmath38 and @xmath44 are exogenous parameters .",
    "they should be determined from the dependence of the empirical complementary cumulative distribution function on variable @xmath6 because both crossovers are sufficiently distinct ( see below for details ) .    apparently , we assumed above that the formalism of the income change is the same for the whole society .",
    "this formalism is expressed by the threshold nonlinear langevin equation where particular dynamics distinguishes the range of the high - income society class from those of the others .    for protection of the equilibrium distribution function against discontinuity at the threshold @xmath43 ( which means adoption of the continuity principle of the equilibrium distribution function of household incomes being a kind of ockham s razor principle ) , the following requirement should be satisfied : @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ rown14a ] ) and ( [ rown14b ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ rown14 ] ) , we directly obtain @xmath48 to assure that the interpretation of the parameter @xmath49 is consistent with the income crossover @xmath38 , we further put @xmath50 moreover , in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ rown16 ] ) , we make even more rigorous assumptions @xmath51    subsequently , by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ rown12 ] ) and ( [ rown13 ] ) into eqs .",

    "these constants are proportional to the normalisation factor @xmath20 .",
    "besides , constant @xmath55 depends on @xmath57 , and @xmath58 while @xmath56 additionally depends on @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . apparently , the number of free ( effective ) parameters driving the two - branch distribution function , eq . ( [ rown19 ] ) , is reduced because this function depends only on the ratio of the initial parameters defining the langevin dynamics ( [ rown1 ] ) .    for @xmath61 , the interpretation of the distribution function , eq . ( [ rown19 ] ) ,",
    "is self - consistent , as required , because the two power - law regimes are well defined .",
    "then , for instance for @xmath37 , the second branch in eq .",
    "( [ rown19 ] ) becomes the power - law dependence driven by the pareto exponent @xmath60 different ( in general ) from @xmath34 .",
    "importantly , our analysis indicates that the existence of the third income region is already allowed by theory .",
    "we are following this indication below .",
    "in principle , we are ready to compare the theoretical complementary cumulative distribution function based on our probability distribution function @xmath62 , given by eq .",
    "( [ rown19 ] ) , with the empirical data for the whole income range .",
    "however , the analytical form of this theoretical complementary cumulative distribution function is unknown in the closed explicit form .",
    "therefore , we calculate it numerically .",
    "the key technical question arises on how to fit this complicated theoretical function to the empirical data .",
    "the fitting procedure consists of three steps as , fortunately , all parameters are to be found ( in principle ) by using independent fitting routines , as follows .    in the initial step , we found rough ( more or less ) approximated values of crossovers @xmath38 and @xmath43 directly from the plot of the empirical complementary cumulative distribution function ( or empirical data )",
    ". thus , uncertainty of the @xmath38 and @xmath43 parameters did not exceed @xmath63 , which was sufficiently accurate .",
    "moreover , we took the exact value of the parameter @xmath19 as the first point in the record of the empirical data .",
    "secondly , we determined the temperature @xmath35 value by fitting the boltzmann - gibbs formula , eq .",
    "( [ rown7 ] ) , to the corresponding empirical data in the range extending from @xmath19 to @xmath38 ( both found in the initial step ) .",
    "notably , we assumed that this formula could be characterised by a single temperature value since the society as a whole was considered to be in ( partial ) equilibrium during the whole fiscal year .",
    "that is , we further put @xmath64 .    at the third step , we determined exponents @xmath58 and @xmath65 by separately fitting the weak pareto law to the empirical data for the medium- and high - income society classes , respectively .",

    "subsequently , the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] was constructed .",
    "it quite well describes the eu medium - income society class by the weak pareto law .",
    "apparently , by joining the forbes empirical database concerning an effective income of billionaires with the eu - silc database , we found that the pareto ( effective , nonuniversal ) exponent increased from @xmath69 to @xmath70 .",
    "this result defines the range of pareto exponents .",
    "this range covers , e.g. the exponent @xmath71 obtained very recently for the medium - income society class in romania for 2008 by considering a voluminous social security database @xcite .",
    "however , this database contains only empirical data for low- and medium - income society class ( in our terminology ) . in principle",
    ", it would be also possible to join this voluminous database with the forbes corresponding dataset if romania billionaires are present as members of the forbes rank . as a result of our joining ,",
    "the range of the medium - income society class became much narrower and shifted to incomes reduced by one order of magnitude .",
    "the medium - income society class is so sensitive to the size of the high - income society class as the former contains only no more than @xmath72 of all households .",

    "importantly , a power - law distribution reveals special property for exponent @xmath76 .",
    "that is , the first and higher moments ( here moments of income ) diverge .",
    "this means that the proper approach should apply quantiles ( which are always finite @xcite ) instead of expectation values .",
    "for instance , the median should be used instead of the mean value .",
    "anyway , the moment estimates are always finite and can be calculated directly from the empirical data .",
    "moreover , there is no characteristic ( physical ) scale in the high - income society class as the mean value diverges .",
    "that is , the ( hierarchical , self - similar in a probabilistic sense ) income structure of the high - income society class is scale free making all levels of the structure equivalent .",
    "in other words , the same dynamical rules apply across the entire high - income society class independently of the particular income of different households ( belonging to the high - income society class ) @xcite .    to complete our analysis , we calculated the pareto exponent for the high - income society class by using an alternative approach .",

    "( [ rown19 ] ) .",
    "hence , we determined @xmath106 and @xmath107 for year 2006 as well as @xmath108 and @xmath109 for year 2008 .",
    "we obtained information on , relatively , how many society members belong to a given income society class .",
    "apparently , population of the medium - income society class is strongly decreased in year 2008 in comparison to that in year 2006 .",
    "several members of this class were shifted both to the low- and to high - income society classes .",
    "our low - parameter approach seems to be much more sensitive than that using the gini coefficient ( g ) @xcite because we obtained @xmath110 and @xmath111 for year 2006 and 2008 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we estimated the percentage breakdown of population of the society classes : for year 2006  low - income : @xmath112 ; medium - income : @xmath113 ; high - income : @xmath114 and for year 2008  low - income : @xmath115 ; medium - income : @xmath116 ; high - income : @xmath117 .",
    "these results can be considered as complementary to that ( obtained above ) corresponding to the relative population of successive income society classes .",
    "interestingly , the total fraction of the medium- and high - income classes in the eu was around @xmath72 in year 2006 , which is about the same as that found by yakovenko et al .",
    "@xcite for the us , and this fraction has decreased to around @xmath118 in year 2008 , most likely due to the financial crisis .",
    "economists often argue that economic and political conditions are quite different in the us and in the eu , and expect a lower income inequality in the eu . however , we demonstrate quantitatively herein that the exponential law does apply to the eu as well .",
    "this finding gives much stronger support for universal applicability of the boltzmann - gibbs law in economics .",
    "our work shows that the income distribution in the low - income class , covering around 97% of population , follows the exponential law , whereas in the two upper - income classes the distribution follows two power laws with different exponents .",
    "remarkably , the role of the medium - income society class is strongly reduced making it an intermediate one within our approach to the complementary cumulative distribution function .",

    "<S> herein , we applied statistical physics to study incomes of three ( low- , medium- and high - income ) society classes instead of the two ( low- and medium - income ) classes studied so far . in the frame of the threshold nonlinear langevin dynamics and its threshold fokker - planck counterpart , we derived a unified formula for description of income of all society classes , by way of example , of those of the european union in year 2006 and 2008 . hence , the formula is more general than the well known that of yakovenko et al . </S>",
    "<S> that is , our formula well describes not only two regions but simultaneously the third region in the plot of the complementary cumulative distribution function vs. an annual household income . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the known stylised facts concerning this income are well described by our formula . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the formula provides the boltzmann - gibbs income distribution function for the low - income society class and the weak pareto law for the medium - income society class , as expected . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , it predicts ( to satisfactory approximation ) the zipf law for the high - income society class . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the region of medium - income society class is now distinctly reduced because the bottom of high - income society class is distinctly lowered . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction made , in fact , the medium - income society class an intermediate - income society class .    </S>",
