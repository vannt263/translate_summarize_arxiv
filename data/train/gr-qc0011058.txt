    "in reference @xcite , barrett and crane have introduced a model for quantum general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the model is based on the topological quantum @xmath1 bf theory , and is obtained by adding a quantum implementation of the constraint that reduces classical bf theory to euclidean gr @xcite . to make use of the barrett - crane construction in quantum gravity , two issues need to be addressed .",
    "first , in order to control the divergences in the sum defining the model , the barrett - crane model is defined in terms of the @xmath2-deformation of @xmath1 . in a realistic model for quantum euclidean",
    "gr , one would like the limit @xmath3 to be well defined .",
    "second , the barrett - crane model is defined over a fixed triangulation .",
    "this is appropriate for a topological field theory such as bf theory , which does not have local excitations .",
    "but the implementation of the bf - to - gr constraint breaks topological invariance and frees local degrees of freedom .",
    "the restriction of the model to a fixed discretization of the manifold can therefore be seen only as an approximation . in order to capture all the degrees of freedom of classical gr , and restore general covariance , an appropriate notion of sum over triangulations",
    "should be implemented ( see for instance @xcite ) . a novel proposal to tackle this problem",
    "is provided by the field theory formulation of spin foam models @xcite . in this formulation ,",
    "a full sum over arbitrary spin foams ( and thus , in particular , over arbitrary triangulations ) is naturally generated as the feynman diagrams expansion of a scalar field theory over a group .",
    "the sum over spinfoams admits a compelling interpretation as a sum over 4-geometries .",
    "the approach represents also a powerful tool for formal manipulations and for model building : examples of this are ooguri s proof of topological invariance of the amplitudes of quantum bf theory in @xcite and the definition of a spinfoam model for lorentzian gr in @xcite .    using such framework of field theories over a group , a spinfoam model for euclidean quantum gr",
    "was defined in @xcite .",
    "this model modifies the barrett - crane model in two respects .",
    "first , it is not restricted to a fixed triangulation , but it naturally includes the full sum over arbitrary spinfoams .",
    "second , the natural implementation of the bf - to - gr constraint in the field theory context fixes the prescription for assigning amplitudes to lower dimensional simplices , an issue not completely addressed in the original barrett - crane model .",
    "this same prescription for lower dimensional simplices amplitudes ( but in the context of a fixed triangulation ) was later re - derived by oriti and williams in @xcite , without using the field theory .",
    "the model introduced in @xcite appeared to be naturally regulated by those lower dimensional amplitudes .",
    "in particular , certain potentially divergent amplitudes were shown to be bounded in @xcite .",
    "these results motivated the conjecture that the model could be finite .",
    "that is , that all feynman diagrams might converge . in this letter",
    "we prove this conjecture .",
    "this paper is not self - contained : familiarity with the formalism defined in @xcite is assumed .",
    "the definition of the model is summarized in the section ii ; for a detailed description of the model we refer to @xcite . in section iii",
    ", a series of auxiliary results is derived .",
    "the proof of finiteness is given in section iv .",
    "consider the fundamental representation of @xmath1 , defined on @xmath4 , and pick a fixed direction @xmath5 in @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the @xmath7 subgroup of @xmath1 that leaves @xmath5 invariant .",
    "the model is defined in terms of a field @xmath8 over @xmath9 , invariant under arbitrary permutations of its arguments .",
    "we define the projectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . the model introduced in @xcite",
    "is defined by the action @xmath15=\\int dg_i \\left [ p_{g } \\phi(g_i ) \\right]^2 + \\frac { 1}{5 ! } \\int dg_i \\left [ p_{g}p_{h}\\phi(g_i ) \\right]^5,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , and the fifth power in the interaction term is notation for @xmath17 ^ 5:=\\phi(g_1,g_2,g_3,g_4)\\   \\phi(g_4,g_5,g_6,g_7)\\ \\phi(g_7,g_3,g_8,g_9)\\ \\phi(g_9,g_6,g_2,g_{10 } ) \\   \\phi(g_{10},g_8,g_5,g_1).\\ ] ]    @xmath11 projects the field into the space of gauge invariant fields , namely , those such that @xmath18 for all @xmath14 .",
    "the projector @xmath10 projects the field over the linear subspace of the fields that are constants on the orbits of @xmath6 in @xmath1 . when expanding the field in modes , that is , on the irreducible representations of @xmath1 , this projection is equivalent to restricting the expansion to the representations in which there is a vector invariant under the subgroup @xmath6 ( because the projection projects on such invariant vectors ) .",
    "the representations in which such invariant vectors exist are the  simple \" , or  balanced \" , representations namely the ones in which the spin of the self dual sector is equal to the spin of the antiselfdual sector can be labeled by two integers @xmath19 . in terms of those integers ,",
    "the dimension of the representation is given by @xmath20 .",
    "simple representations are those for which @xmath21 . ] . in turn , the simple representations are the ones whose generators have equal selfdual and antiself dual components , and this equality , under identification of the @xmath1 generator with the @xmath22 field of @xmath23 theory is precisely the constraint that reduces @xmath23 theory to gr .",
    "alternatively , this constraint allows one to identify the generators as bivectors defining elementary surfaces in 4d , and thus to interpret the coloring of a two - simplex as the choice of a ( discretized ) 4d geometry @xcite .    using the peter - weyl theorem one can write the partition function of the theory @xmath24}\\ ] ] as a perturbative sum over the amplitudes @xmath25 of feynman diagrams @xmath26 .",
    "this computation is performed in great detail in @xcite , yielding @xmath27 the first summation is over pentavalent 2-complexes @xmath26 , defined combinatorially as a set of faces @xmath28 , edges @xmath29 and vertices @xmath30 , and their boundary relations .",
    "the second sum is over simple @xmath1 representations @xmath31 coloring the faces of @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath32 is the dimension of the simple representation @xmath31 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath33 is a function of the four colors that label the corresponding faces bounded by the edge .",
    "it is explicitly given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the dimension of the space of the intertwiners between the four representations @xmath36@xcite .",
    "the vertex amplitude @xmath37 is the barrett - crane vertex amplitude , which is a function of the ten colors of the faces adjacent to the 5-valent vertex of @xmath26 .",
    "the barrett - crane vertex amplitude can be written as a combination of @xmath38 symbols . however , as it was shown by barrett in @xcite , it can also be express as an integral over five copies of the 3-sphere  a representation with a nice geometrical interpretation .",
    "this representation is better suited for our purposes so we give it here explicitly @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the invariant normalized measure on the sphere .",
    "if we represent the points in the 3-sphere as unit - norm vectors @xmath41 in @xmath4 , and we define the angle @xmath42 by @xmath43 , then the kernel @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 this is a smooth bounded functions on @xmath46 , with maximum value @xmath47 .",
    "our task is to prove convergence of the feynman integrals of the theory . in the mode expansion ,",
    "potential divergences appear in the sum over representations @xmath31 .",
    "therefore we need to analyze the behavior of vertex and edge amplitudes for large values of @xmath31 .",
    "an arbitrary point @xmath48 can be written in spherical coordinates as @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the invariant normalized measure in this coordinates is @xmath53 using the gauge invariance of the vertex , the invariance of the three sphere under the action of @xmath1 and the normalization of the invariant measure , we can compute ( [ vv ] ) by dropping one of the integrals and fixing one point on @xmath54 , say @xmath55 . thus equation ( [ vv ] )",
    "becomes @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the normalized measure on the 2-sphere @xmath58constant .",
    "now we bound the barrett - crane amplitude using that @xmath59 , namely @xmath60 the argument is obviously independent of the choice of the six colors in ( [ depe ] ) .",
    "weaker versions of the bound in which more colors are included also hold .",
    "in particular if we directly bound the @xmath61 s in ( [ vv ] ) we obtain that the absolute value of the amplitude is bounded by the square root of the product of the ten dimensions .",
    "more in general , let @xmath62 , with @xmath63 taking the values @xmath64 , be an arbitrary subset of @xmath65 with @xmath66 elements .",
    "then the following bound holds for any @xmath62 @xmath67 for @xmath68 we recover ( [ depe ] ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "barrett and williams have analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the oscillatory part of the amplitude , in connection to the classical limit of the theory .",
    "we add here some information on the asymptotic behavior of the magnitude of ( [ vv ] ) .",
    "the results of this paragraph will not be used in the rest of the paper ; we present them since they follow naturally from our previous considerations .",
    "equation ( [ sisi ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a smooth bounded function in @xmath71\\in \\re $ ] , since @xmath72 is given by an integral of smooth and bounded functions on a compact space .",
    "therefore , the following limit holds @xmath73 the same argument can be used to prove the following stronger result @xmath74 where , in the limit , the four colors are taken simultaneously to infinity .",
    "clearly , these equations are valid for any choice of the @xmath75 s .",
    "finally , it is easy to verify the following inequalities for the dimension of the space of intertwiners between four representations converging at an edge ( see @xcite ) @xmath76 which holds for any @xmath77 . using this expression",
    ", we can construct weaker bounds in the spirit of ( [ cota ] ) .",
    "we define the set @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) as an arbitrary subset of @xmath80 with @xmath81 elements .",
    "then the following inequalities hold for any @xmath82 @xmath83",
    "we have now all the tools for proving the finiteness of the model .",
    "we will construct a finite bound for the amplitudes @xmath25 , defined in ( [ z ] ) , of arbitrary feynman diagrams of the model . inserting the inequalities ( [ dd ] ) and ( [ cota ] ) , both with @xmath84 , in the definition of @xmath25 , we obtain a bound for the amplitude of an arbitrary pentavalent 2-complex @xmath26 .",
    "namely , @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the number of edges of the face @xmath28 .",
    "the term @xmath87 in ( [ lala ] ) comes from various contributions .",
    "first , we have @xmath32 from the face amplitude .",
    "second , we have @xmath88 and @xmath89 from the denominators of the @xmath86 edge amplitudes ( [ xii ] ) and the bounds for the corresponding numerators ( [ dd ] ) respectively .",
    "finally , we have @xmath89 from the bounds for the @xmath86 vertex amplitudes ( [ cota ] ) .",
    "if the 2-complex contains only faces with more than one edge , then the previous bound for the amplitude is finite .",
    "more precisely , if all the @xmath86 s are such that @xmath90 then @xmath91 , and using the fact that @xmath92 the sum on the rhs of the last equation converges .    on the other hand , if some of the @xmath86 are equal to 1 , then the right hand side of ( [ lala ] ) diverges , and therefore for this case we need a stricter bound , involving stronger inequalities .",
    "this can be done as follows .",
    "notice that every time a 2-complex contains a face whose boundary is given by a single edge , the same edge must be part of the boundary of another face , bounded by more than one edge . in fig .",
    "1 an elementary vertex of a 2-complex containing such a face is shown . the thick lines represent edges converging at the vertex , each of them is part of the boundary of four faces . to visualize those faces we have drawn in thin lines the intersection of the vertex diagram with a 3-sphere .",
    "there is a face bounded by a single edge .",
    "its intersection with the sphere is denoted by @xmath93 .",
    "notice that the surface intersecting the sphere in @xmath94 will have a boundary defined by at least two edges .",
    "notice also that a single vertex can have a maximum of two such peculiar faces .",
    "therefore , using ( [ dd ] ) for @xmath95 we can choose to bound the numerator in ( [ xii ] ) with the colors corresponding to the three adjacent faces like @xmath94 in fig .",
    "1 . if @xmath96 denotes the color of the face @xmath93 then we construct the bound for the amplitude using @xmath97 one of the square roots would be sufficient to bound the edge amplitude , but the symmetry in the previous expression simplifies the construction of the bound for the amplitude of an arbitrary 2-complex . then use ( [ cota ] ) for @xmath95 ( or @xmath98 ) to bound the vertex amplitude corresponding to a vertex containing one ( respectively two ) face(s )",
    "whose boundary is given by only one edge . in this way",
    ", we can exclude the color corresponding to these `` singular '' faces from the bounds corresponding to the vertex and the denominator of the edge amplitude .",
    "thus these faces contribute to the bound as @xmath32 ( face amplitude ) times @xmath99 ( from the denominator of the single edge amplitude ) , i.e. , as @xmath100 .",
    "we keep using ( [ dd ] ) , and ( [ cota ] ) for @xmath84 for faces with @xmath101 and vertices containing no faces with @xmath102 . if we denote by @xmath103 and @xmath104 the set of faces with more than one edge and one edge respectively , the general bound is finally given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 denotes the number of faces in the 2-complex @xmath26 , and @xmath107 denotes the riemann zeta function .",
    "this concludes the proof of the finiteness of the amplitude for any 2-complex @xmath26 @xmath108",
    "equation ( [ oui ] ) proves that there are no divergent amplitudes in the field theory defined by ( [ tope ] ) .",
    "this field theory was defined in @xcite as a model for euclidean quantum gravity based on the implementations of the constraints that reduce @xmath1 bf theory to euclidean gr .",
    "the corresponding bf topological theory is divergent after quantization : regularization is done ad - hoc by introducing a cut - off in the colors or , more elegantly , by means of the quantum deformation of the group ( @xmath109 ) . remarkably , the implementation of the constrains that give the theory the status of a quantum gravity model automatically regularizes the amplitudes .",
    "another encouraging result comes from the fact that according to equation ( [ oui ] ) contributions of feynman diagrams decay exponentially with the number of faces .",
    "this might be useful for studying the convergence of the full sum over 2-complexes .",
