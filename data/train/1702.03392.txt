    "particularly , tetra metal nitrides @xmath1 , generally formed only for late 3d tm ( e.g. fe , co , ni )  @xcite are somewhat unique in the sense that they share a common fcc structure . due to a dominant metal - metal interactions in @xmath1  they possess metal like character ( unlike metal oxides )  @xcite . in a metal fcc cage ,",
    "the incorporation of n atoms at the interstitial positions , results in an expansion of the unit cell , which in turn affects the magnetic integrations @xcite .",
    "generally incorporation of a non - magnetic element in a magnetic one is expected to result in a loss of magnetic moment ( @xmath2 ) explained by the well - known slater - pauling curve  @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical calculations predict @xmath2 to be larger for @xmath3  and @xmath0  compounds .",
    "this is an interesting proposition as with larger than metal @xmath2 , corrosion resistance and a metal like character can make @xmath1  compounds an alternative their pure metal counterparts . in addition , some recent theoretical predicted a very spin polarization ratio ( spr ) for @xmath1  compounds@xcite . among them",
    "@xmath0  is predicted to have spr @xmath4 90  @xcite which is among the highest values for any compound .",
    "however experimental results obtained so far for @xmath0  compounds does not seems to be as exciting as theoretical calculations .",
    "this can be understood from the fact that the value of @xmath2 found in most of the experimental works so far is perpetually less than than that of pure co. a closer look at the @xmath0  thin films reveal that the values of lattice parameter ( lp ) obtained in most of the experimental works is typically 3.54  @xcite .",
    "this is more close to theoretical values lp for fcc co at 3.54 than that of @xmath0  at 3.72  @xcite .",
    "such a discrepancy in the experimental and theoretical values of lp for @xmath0  requires attention .",
    "while investigating the recipes adopted for formation of @xmath0  thin films , we found that @xmath0  films were often deposited at substrate temperatures ( @xmath5 ) similar to those used for @xmath3  thin films .",
    "this is convenient approach due to similarity between the @xmath3  and @xmath0  and the absence of a phase diagram for the system co - n , intuitively makes one to follow paths adopted for preparation of @xmath3 .",
    "however , the energetics of nitride formation for @xmath3and @xmath0  immediately indicates about the complexity for the later .",
    "theoretical values of enthalpy of formation ( @xmath6@xmath7 ) for @xmath3  is about -12kj  mol@xmath8  @xcite , whereas those for @xmath0  are slightly above or below 0 for hcp co or fcc co  @xcite .",
    "this also implies that at a higher @xmath5 , @xmath0  system will be less stable as compared to @xmath3 . in a recent work , we studied the phase formation process in the co - n system at @xmath5  = 300k  @xcite and 523k  @xcite .",
    "we found that at @xmath5  = 523k , n incorporation in the co - n system is minimal and the phases formed are similar to a fcc co having lp@xmath43.52 . on the other hand when @xmath5is lowered to 300k",
    "co - n depicts a similar type of phase formation sequence as found for the fe - n system  @xcite . by optimizing",
    "the deposition conditions , @xmath0  film having lp as high as 3.68 can be deposited and the value of @xmath2 also supersedes that of co. since the @xmath0  films deposited without any intentional heating are expected to have a large fraction of disorder , estimation of lp with x - ray diffraction alone may not be decisive , therefore in the present work , we investigate the local structure and @xmath2 of the @xmath0  thin film deposited at @xmath5  = 300k using x - ray absorption based techniques . by doing measurements at co k and l - edges and at n k - edge , we get valuable information about the local structure . in addition , by doing polarizer neutron reflectivity ( pnr ) measurements at low temperatures ( @xmath420k ) we determined the value of @xmath2 for @xmath0  thin film .",
    "obtained results are presented and discussed in this work .",

    "the measurements in tey mode at bl-01 were carried out in a uhv chamber with a base pressure of ( 2@xmath1010@xmath12torr ) . to avoid surface contaminations , samples were cleaned @xmath13 using a ar@xmath14 source kept incident at an angle of 45 @xmath15 .",

    "[ fig : xafs](a ) and ( b ) shows the normalized xanes and exafs patterns for @xmath0  sample together with a co metal as a reference .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the intensity in the white line region is higher in the @xmath0  sample(marked by an arrow in  [ fig : xafs](a ) ) , which essentially arises due to hybridization between face centered co 3d and n 2p bands through @xmath18@xmath19 anti - bonding and an enhancement in density of states in @xmath0  as compared to co. such effects are even more pronounced at co l - edges as shown in fig .",

    "we consider space group @xmath24 and lp = 3.74 . among other parameters",
    "the fitting of exafs data also yields the distance between corner co atoms which is equal to the lp .",
    "we found that the lp comes out to be 3.92   with ( @xmath18@xmath17 = 0.0145  @xmath17 ) ; these values for the co reference sample are 3.47   with ( @xmath18@xmath17 = 0.0093  @xmath17 ) .",
    "the value of lp obtained in our case is considerably larger than that of silva @xmath25  @xcite in a recent work for their @xmath0  thin film .",
    "they found lp = 3.53   with ( @xmath18@xmath17 = 0.005  @xmath17 ) .",
    "considering even large inaccuracy of exafs technique in determination of lp , our values are considerably larger and clearly indicate an expansion in the co lattice by incorporation of n. it may be noted that silva @xmath25  @xcite deposited their samples at a @xmath5  = 523k and at this temperature it may happen that most of n atoms diffuse out of the system leaving behind a dominant fcc co as found in our recent work  @xcite .",
    "it may be noted that in most of experimental work carried out in the @xmath0  thin films always a high @xmath5  was used and the measured values of lp were closer to fcc co rather than that of @xmath0 . since lp and the @xmath2 are correlated and an expansion in the lp due to interstitial incorporation of n atoms is responsible for enhanced @xmath2  @xcite , the values of @xmath2 obtained in most of the works were closer to pure co. to measure @xmath2 in our samples we did bulk magnetization and pnr measurements .",
    "inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : pnr ] shows m - h loop measured using s - vsm at room temperature for a @xmath0  thin film .",
    "we find that @xmath2 = 1195emu / cc which approximately corresponds 1.6@xmath26 per co atom , which is slightly lower than the theoretically predicted value of @xmath2 for @xmath0 .",
    "exact determination of @xmath2 from bulk magnetization measurements in a thin film sample require precise values of sample volume and density .",
    "while the former can be measured with a great accuracy , estimation of later is not easy due to relatively large fraction of defects etc . in thin films .",
    "in addition diamagnetism of substrate always interferes with sample magnetization .",
    "it is well - known that in a pnr measurement , absolute value of @xmath2 can be measured as in pnr technique , measurement of @xmath2 is not influenced by sample volume and substrate magnetism . on the other hand density of the film",
    "is inherently measured in pnr .",
    "in this context it is surprising to note that pnr has not been used to measure @xmath2 in @xmath0  thin films . in most of the works",
    "available so far , @xmath2 was measured using bulk magnetization methods and there seems to be a large variations in estimation of @xmath2 for @xmath0  thin films ranging from 1.3 to 1.6@xmath26/atom  @xcite .",
    "we performed pnr measurement at room temperature and at 17k ( to minimize thermal fluctuations ) under an applied magnetic field of 0.5 t , which is sufficient to saturate sample magnetically ( see inset of  [ fig : pnr ] ) .",
    "the spin - up down reflectivities clearly show a separation typically expected for a ferromagnetic sample .",
    "the fitting of pnr patterns was carried out using simulreflec programme  @xcite and the obtained values of @xmath2 are 1.73(@xmath160.05)@xmath26/atom at 300k and 1.75(@xmath160.05)@xmath26/atom at 17k .",
    "this clearly shows that @xmath2 is larger than co in @xmath0  thin film .",
    "though such enhancement in @xmath2 was theoretically predicted , it has been unambiguously demonstrated in this work .",
    "in conclusion , by measuring the local structure and a we found that lp of @xmath0  thin films far exceeds that of previous works and is more closer to its theoretical value . for @xmath0",
    "thin films an enhancement in @xmath2 was expected . by by doing precise magnetization measurements using pnr we found enhancement in the co magnetic moment .",
