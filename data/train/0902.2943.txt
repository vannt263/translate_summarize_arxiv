    "in classical mechanics , integrable hamiltonian dynamics is characterized by the existence of as many conserved quantities as degrees of freedom .",
    "each trajectory in the corresponding phase space evolves on an invariant hyper - torus @xcite .",
    "in contrast , chaotic systems are ergodic ; almost all orbits fill the energy shell in a uniform way .",
    "physical systems with integrable and fully chaotic dynamics are exceptional .",
    "a typical hamiltonian system shows a mixed phase space in which regions of regular motion and chaotic dynamics coexist .",
    "systems of this kind are known as mixed systems .",
    "their dynamical behavior is by no means universal .",
    "if we perturb an integrable system , most of the periodic orbits on tori with rational frequencies disappear .",
    "however , some of these orbits persist .",
    "elliptic periodic orbits appear surrounded by islands .",
    "they correspond to librational motions around these periodic orbits and reflect their stability . the kolmogorov - arnold ( kam ) theorem establishes the stability with respect to small perturbations of invariant tori with a sufficiently incommensurate frequency vector .",
    "when the perturbation increases , numerical simulations show that more and more tori are destroyed . for large enough perturbations , there are locally no tori in the considered region of phase - space .",
    "the break - up of invariant tori leads to a loss of stability of the system , to chaos .",
    "different scenaria of transition to chaos in dynamical systems have been considered .",
    "there are three main scenaria of transition to global chaos in finite - dimensional ( non - extended ) dynamical systems : via the cascade of period - doubling bifurcations , the lorenz system - like transition via hopf and shilnikov bifurcations , and the transition to chaos via intermittences @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that there could be other ( presumably many more ) such scenaria in extended ( infinite - dimensional ) dynamical systems .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the specification of a wave function is always related to a certain basis . in integrable systems eigenbasis of the hamiltonian",
    "is known in principle . in this basis",
    ", each eigenfunction has just one component that obviously indicates the absence of complexity . in the nearly ordered regime , mixing of quantum states belonging to adjacent levels can be ignored and the energy levels are uncorrelated .",
    "the level - spacing distribution function obeys the poissonian , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the energy spacing between adjacent levels normalized by the mean level spacing @xmath2 . on the other hand , the eigenfunctions a hamiltonian with a chaotic classical limit is unknown in principle . in other words",
    ", there is no special basis to express the eigenstates of a chaotic system . if we try to express the wave functions of a chaotic system in terms of a given basis , their components become on average uniformly distributed over the whole basis .",
    "they are also extended in all other bases .",
    "for example , berry @xcite conjectured that the wavefunctions of chaotic quantum systems can be represented as a formal sum over elementary solutions of the laplace equation in which real and imaginary parts of coefficients are independent identically - distributed gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance computed from the normalization .",
    "bohigas et al .",
    "@xcite put forward a conjecture ( strongly supported by accumulated numerical evidence ) that the spectral statistics of chaotic systems follow random - matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite .",
    "this theory models a chaotic system by an ensemble of random hamiltonian matrices @xmath3 that belong to one of the three universal classes , orthogonal , unitary and symplectic .",
    "the theory is based on two main assumptions : the matrix elements are independent identically - distributed random variables , and their distribution is invariant under unitary transformations .",
    "these lead to a gaussian probability density distribution for the matrix elements .",
    "the gaussian distribution is also obtained by maximizing the shannon entropy under constraints of normalization and existence of the expectation value of tr@xmath4 , where tr denotes the trace and @xmath5 stands for the hermitian conjugate of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the statistical information about the eigenvalues and/or eigenvectors of the matrix can be obtained by integrating out all the undesired variables from distribution of the matrix elements .",
    "this theory predicts a universal form of the spectral correlation functions determined solely by some global symmetries of the system ( time - reversal invariance and value of the spin ) .",
    "time - reversal - invariant quantum system are represented by a gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) of random matrices when the system has rotational symmetry and by a gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse ) otherwise .",
    "chaotic systems without time reversal invariance are represented by the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) .",
    "the dimension @xmath6 of the underlying parameter space is used to label these three ensembles : for goe , gue and gse , @xmath6 takes the values 1 , 2 and 4 , respectively . among several measures representing spectral correlations , the nearest - neighbor level - spacing distribution function @xmath7 has been extensively studied so far . according to the random matrix theory ,",
    "the level spacing distribution function in the chaotic phase is approximated by the wigner - dyson distribution , namely,@xmath8 the coefficients @xmath9  and @xmath10 are determined by the normalization conditions @xmath11 , as @xmath12and@xmath13 . for @xmath14 ,",
    "the distribution function is proportional to @xmath15 , which implies that adjacent energy levels can not approach each other indefinitely because of mixing between two extended states .",
    "the assumptions that lead to rmt do not apply for mixed systems .",
    "the hamiltonian of a typical mixed system can be described as a random matrix with some ( or all ) of its elements as randomly distributed . here",
    "the distributions of various matrix elements need not be same , may or may not be correlated and some of them can be non - random too .",
    "this is a difficult route to follow .",
    "so far in the literature , there is no rigorous statistical description for the transition from integrability to chaos .",
    "there have been several proposals for phenomenological random matrix theories that interpolate between the wigner - dyson rmt and banded rm with the ( almost ) poissonian level statistics .",
    "the standard route of the derivation is to sacrifice basis invariance but keep matrix - element independence .",
    "the first work in this direction is due to rosenzweig and porter @xcite .",
    "they model the hamiltonian of the mixed system by a superposition of two matrices : a diagonal matrix of random elements having the same variance and a matrix drawn from a goe .",
    "therefore , the variances of the diagonal elements total hamiltonian are different from those of the off - diagonal ones , unlike the standard goe hamiltonian in which the variances of diagonal elements are twice of the off - diagonal ones .",
    "hussein and sato @xcite used the maximum entropy principle to construct such ensembles by imposing additional constraints .",
    "ensembles of band random matrices whose entries are equal to zero outside a band of width @xmath16 along the principal diagonal have also been often used to model mixed systems @xcite .",
    "another route for generalizing rmt is to conserve base invariance but allow for correlation of matrix elements .",
    "this has been achieved by maximizing non - extensive entropies subject to the constraint of fixed expectation value of tr@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "recently , an equivalent approach is presented in @xcite , which is based on the method of superstatistics ( statistics of a statistics ) proposed by beck and cohen @xcite .",
    "this formalism has been elaborated and applied successfully to a wide variety of physical problems , e.g. , in @xcite . in thermostatics ,",
    "superstatistics arises as weighted averages of ordinary statistics ( the boltzmann factor ) due to fluctuations of one or more intensive parameter ( e.g. the inverse temperature ) .",
    "its application to rmt assumes the spectrum of a mixed system is made up of many smaller cells that are temporarily in a chaotic phase .",
    "each cell is large enough to obey the statistical requirements of rmt but has a different distribution parameter @xmath18 associated with it , according to a probability density @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the superstatistical random - matrix ensemble describes the mixed system as a mixture of gaussian ensembles with a statistical weight @xmath20therefore one can evaluate any statistic for the superstatistical ensemble by simply integrating the corresponding statistic for the conventional gaussian ensemble .",
    "in 1957 jaynes @xcite proposed a rule , based on information theory , to provide a constructive criterion for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge .",
    "this leads to a type of statistical inference which is called the maximum - entropy principle ( maxent ) .",
    "it is the least biased estimate possible on the given information .",
    "jaynes showed in particular how his rule , when applied to statistical mechanics , leads to the usual gibbs canonical distribution .",
    "the core of the maxent method resides in interpreting entropy , through the shannon axioms , as a measure of the amount of uncertainty  or of the amount of information that is missing  in a probability distribution .",
    "this was an important step forward because it extended the applicability of the notion of entropy far beyond its original roots in thermodynamics .",
    "balian considered the application of maxent to the random - matrix theory by maximizing the shannon entropy under constraints of normalization and existence of the expectation value of tr@xmath4 . in this section ,",
    "we consider possible generaliztion of rmt by extremizing two different entropies , namely tsallis and kaniadakis , rather than shannon s entropy .",
    "the extremization is again subject to the constraint of normalization and existence of the expectation value of tr@xmath21 . for completeness , we start by a brief review of the conventional random - matrix theory .",
    "balian @xcite derived the weight functions @xmath22 for the random - matrix ensembles from maxent postulating the existence of a second moment of the hamiltonian .",
    "he applied the conventional shannon definition for the entropy to ensembles of random matrices as@xmath23 and maximized it under the constraints of normalization of @xmath24  and fixed mean value of tr@xmath25 .",
    "the latter constraint ensures basis independence , which is a property of the trace of a matrix .",
    "then , the distribution @xmath26 is determined from the extremum of the functional@xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath18 are lagrange multipliers .",
    "its maximum is obtained equating its functional derivative to zero .",
    "he obtained @xmath29   , \\ ] ] where @xmath30   d\\mathbf{h}$ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that the joint distribution of matrix elements obtained in eq .",
    "( 4 ) satisfies the two conditions of rmt , namely uncorrelated matrix - elements and base independence .",
    "the first condition follow since the distribution ( 4 ) is a gaussian distribution with inverse variance @xmath31 , since tr@xmath32 , where all the four matrices @xmath33 with @xmath34 are real .",
    "this allows the factorization of @xmath35 into products of terms depending only on the individual matrix elements .",
    "therefore , the matrix elements of @xmath3 are independent .",
    "base independence follows from the fact that the distribution ( 18 ) depends on @xmath3 in the combination tr@xmath36 . indeed , if two matrices * a * and * b * that express the same operator in two different bases are related by a similarity transformation * b * = @xmath37 , then such operators have the same trace .",

    "is known to proceed continuously , we have to relax this condition and allow @xmath162 to take any real value between 1 and @xmath97 .",
    "let us restrict our following consideration to the case of orthogonal symmetry with @xmath137 using the asymptotic expression of the modified bessel function @xcite , we easily find@xmath188 which is the wigner surmise , as required .",
    "the other limit of @xmath189 yields the semi - poisson distribution@xmath190 which is known to provide a satisfactory description for the spectra of pseudointegrable systems such as planar polygonal billiards , when all their angles are rational with @xmath191 @xcite .",
    "the motion of the corresponding classical systems in phase space is not restricted to a torus like for integrable systems , but to a surface with a more complicated topology @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that the assumption that the inverse square of the variance of matrix elements as an inverse @xmath168 variable allows one to model the transition out of chaos ( corresponding to @xmath192 until the system reaches the state of quasi - integrability as the effective number @xmath162 of components of @xmath187 approaches 1 .",
    "if one allows @xmath162 to take lower values , then the distribution @xmath193 tends to the poisson distribution as @xmath194;@xmath195 we there conclude that formula @xmath193 can provide a model for describing the stochastic transition all the way from integrability to chaos passing by the stage of quasi - integrability .",
    "the nns distributions @xmath196 and @xmath197  obtained above when the entropy is given by the tsallis and kaniadakis entropies , respectively , as well as the superstatistical distribution @xmath198 describe evolution of the spacing distribution from the wigner shape to the poissonian",
    ". they can be useful for describing systems with mixed regular - chaotic at least when more familiar distributions such as berry and robnik s or brody s distribution @xcite do not fit the data satisfactorily .",
    "we shall demonstrate this by using these distributions to fit the nns distribution of levels of a number of mixed systems .",
    "billiards can be used as simple models in the study of hamiltonian systems .",
    "they consist of a point particle which is confined to a container of some shape and reflected elastically on impact with the boundary .",
    "the shape determines whether the dynamics inside the billiard is regular , chaotic or mixed .",
    "the best - known examples of chaotic billiards are the sinai billiard ( a square table with a circular barrier at its center ) and the bunimovich stadium ( a rectangle with two circular caps ) @xcite .",
    "neighboring parallel orbits diverge when they collide with dispersing components of the billiard boundary . in mixed billiards ,",
    "some neighboring parallel orbits converge at first , but divergence prevails over convergence on average . divergence and convergence are balanced in integrable billiards such as circles and ellipses .",
    "recently bunimovich introduced the so - called ` mushroom ' billiard @xcite with the novel feature of a well - understood divided phase - space comprising a single integrable region and a single ergodic one .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to mushroom billiards which consist of a semicircular region , the ` hat ' and a ` stem ' , which is symmetrically attached to its base . as the width of the stem varies from zero to the diameter of the hat",
    ", there is a continuous transition from integrability ( the semicircle billiard ) to ergodicity ( in case of a rectangular stem the stadium billiard ) . in mushroom billiards ,",
    "the regular region has a well - defined semicircular border .",
    "it is composed of those trajectories in the hat that never cross this border and therefore remain in the hat forever .",
    "their integrability is due to the conservation of the reflection angle for collisions with the semicircular boundary .",
    "the chaotic component consists of trajectories that enter the stem of the mushroom billiard .",
    "two mushroom billiards have been recently investigated experimentally @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the width of the stem to the diameter of the hat is 1:3 for the small mushroom billiard and 2:3 for the large .",
    "both billiards have mixed dynamics with classical phase spaces of different structures for the two billiards .",
    "the degree of chaos , which is the measure of all chaotic parts of the phase space , is 45.5  @xmath199 and 82.9  @xmath199 , respectively .",
    "both systems have been studied experimentally in the quantum limit exploiting the analogy between a quantum billiard and a flat cylindric microwave billiard of the same shape .",
    "the electromagnetic resonances in each microwave cavity can directly be associated with quantum states in the corresponding quantum billiard . for the evaluation of statistical measures ,",
    "a sufficiently large number of resonances is needed .",
    "the first 780 resonances could be detected in the small billiards and 938 in the large one .",
    "the quantum eigenvalues were obtained experimentally by exploiting the equivalence of the schrdinger equation of a plane quantum billiard and the helmholtz equation for the electric field strength in a cylindrical microwave resonator for wave lengths longer than twice the height of the resonator . to compare the statistical properties of the eigenvalues with universal predictions considered in the present paper",

    "random matrix theory is the statistical theory of random matrices , whose entries fluctuate as independent gaussian random numbers .",
    "the matrix - element distribution is obtained by extremizing shannon s entropy subject to the constraint of normalization and constant trace of the square of the matrix .",
    "the latter constraint renders the matrix - element distribution base independent .",
    "while most of the previously proposed generaliztion of rmt violate base invariance , the ones reviewed in this paper conserve it .",
    "non - extensive generalizations extremize nonextensive entropies such as tsallis or kaniadakis , rather than shannon s .",
    "superstatistical generalizations , on the other hand , allow the fluctuation of the mean local density of states which is fixed in the standard theory .",
    "these generalizations of rmt , seen from the present perspective , may bear interest per se because of the additional nontrivial fluctuations introduced in a simple model .",
    "in addition , they may constitute a useful statistical paradigm for the analysis of the spectral fluctuations of systems with mixed regular - chaotic dynamics .",
    "for this purpose , simple analytical expressions are derived in each case for the nearest neighbor level distributions , being among the most popular characteristics of spectral fluctuation .",
    "the formalism has been checked by the analysis of experimental resonance spectra of mixed microwave billiards and geometrical resonances in random binary networks .",
    "the predictions of the three models satisfactorily describe the experimental trends of the evolution of nns distributions during the transition out of chaos .",
