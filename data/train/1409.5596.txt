    "understanding ( zero temperature ) quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) @xcite has become an important part of quantum many - body theory . on the one hand , quantum fluctuations",
    "grow at the qpt and variance and entropic uncertainty measures turn out to give a good description of the qpt .",
    "recently @xcite , uncertainty measures in the ( spin - boson ) dicke model @xcite , which also undergoes a qpt , have been studied ( see also @xcite for other information theoretical measures of delocalization to study qpts ) . on the other hand , large correlations and collective behavior",
    "are an intrinsic part of critical systems and , therefore , entanglement measures should also capture the essence of this qpts ( see e.g. @xcite for entanglement properties of the dicke model and @xcite for entanglement and localization of a two - mode bose - einstein condensate ) .",
    "in this article we shall focus on the study of entanglement properties of the so - called ` vibron models ' @xcite , which are used to study rotational and vibrational spectra in diatomic and polyatomic molecules and also exhibit a ( shape ) qpt .",
    "they were introduced by iachello @xcite in the 80 s through an algebraic approach , based on the concept of spectrum - generating algebra .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the two - dimensional @xmath9 vibron model describing a system containing a dipole degree of freedom constrained to planar motion @xcite .",
    "the basic example of such a system is a triatomic linear bender molecule , although extensions to more complex molecular systems can also be considered . in these models ,",
    "one finds different ( shape ) phases connected to specific geometric configurations of the ground state and related to distinct dynamic symmetries of the hamiltonian ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the qpt occurs as a function of a control parameter @xmath8 that appears in the hamiltonian @xmath10 in the form of a convex combination @xmath11 . at @xmath12",
    "the system is in phase i , characterized by the dynamical symmetry @xmath13 of @xmath14 , and at @xmath15 the system is in phase ii , characterized by the dynamical symmetry @xmath16 of @xmath17 .",
    "the classical , thermodynamic or mean - field , limit of these models is studied by using an algorithm introduced by gilmore @xcite which makes use of semi - classical ( boson - condensate ) coherent states ( css ) ( see e.g. @xcite for standard references on css ) , as variational states to approximate the ground state energy .",
    "however , these trial states , as such , do not display an intrinsic parity symmetry ( see e.g. @xcite ) present in the hamiltonian , as they do not have a definite parity .",
    "we would like to mention that the key role of parity has also been recently noticed by @xcite in the context of qpt ( from normal to superradiant ) in the dicke model for matter - field ( spin - boson ) interactions .",
    "we shall see that , disregarding parity , leads to wrong results of vibration - rotation entanglement measures for usual variational approximations to the ground state in terms of ( non - symmetry - adapted ) css .",
    "then we shall introduce even ( resp .",
    "odd ) css adapted to the parity symmetry of the hamiltonian to describe the ground ( resp .",
    "first - excited ) state of the two - dimensional @xmath9 vibron model .",
    "these even and odd css are `` schrodinger s catlike - states '' in the sense that they are a quantum superposition of quasi - classical , macroscopically distinguishable ( with negligible overlap ) states .",
    "schrodinger s cat states are experimentally generated ( see e.g. @xcite ) and prove to be very useful to study the process of decoherence which limits the development of quantum computing .",
    "we shall show that even - cat states provide finite-(@xmath0)-size approximation to some @xmath18 quantities like the ground state energy ` per particle ' and order parameters like the ` equilibrium radius ' ( see also @xcite for other analytical results of finite - size corrections beyond the mean - field limit approximation in vibron models ) .",
    "even - cat states will also quantitatively and qualitatively capture entanglement and delocalization measures of the exact ground state for finite @xmath0 .",
    "we have to say that finite - size effects have also been discussed in the above - mentioned dicke model , both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite , for thermodynamical quantities and in @xcite for the entanglement entropy , although the role of parity is not explicit in these studies ( see @xcite and @xcite for the relevance of parity in uncertainty measures inside the dicke model ) .",
    "finite - size corrections in @xcite and in @xcite ( for two - level boson systems ) use a @xmath19 expansion naturally given by the holstein - primakoff representation of the angular momentum @xcite . for finite - size precursors of qpts in atomic nuclei models see for example @xcite and references therein .",
    "we must stress that , in this paper , we do not make any of these @xmath19 expansions around @xmath18 , but we are working with finite @xmath0 .",
    "numerical ( exact ) results of the ground state energy , entanglement and delocalization measures are already nicely reproduced by even - cat states for finite @xmath0 .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we briefly review the @xmath9 algebraic approach to two - dimensional ( 2d ) vibron models ( more details can be found in @xcite ) and we propose a new kind of variational states by adapting ` projective ' ( ` hartree axial ' @xcite ) css to the parity symmetry of the hamiltonian . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we compute vibration - rotation entanglement measures like ` purity ' , linear and von neumann entropy , as a function of the vibron number @xmath0 ( related to the total number of bound states of the molecule ) and the control parameter @xmath8 , revealing a sudden increase of entanglement from linear to bent phases at the critical point @xmath1 .",
    "the calculation is done numerically and complemented and compared with two variational approximations ( parity - symmetric and non - symmetric ) , which enrich the study .",
    "finally , we compute the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) , as a measure of delocalization of the ground state wave packet across the phase transition , and see that the spreading is captured by the new proposed symmetry - adapted ( even - cat ) css , thus revealing the importance of parity symmetry . sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "2d - vibron models describe a system containing a dipole degree of freedom constrained to planar motion .",
    "elementary excitations are ( creation and annihilation ) 2d vector @xmath20-bosons @xmath21 and a scalar @xmath22-boson @xmath23 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce circular bosons : @xmath24 .",
    "the nine generators of the @xmath9 algebra are bilinear products of creation and annihilation operators , in particular : @xmath25 denote the number operator of vector @xmath26 and scalar @xmath27 bosons , 2d angular momentum @xmath28 and dipole @xmath29 operators , respectively ( see @xcite for the reminder four operators @xmath30 , which will not be used here ) . assuming the total number of bosons @xmath31 and the 2d angular momentum @xmath28 to be conserved",
    ", there are only two dynamical symmetry limits , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , associated with two algebraic chains starting from @xmath9 and ending in @xmath34 : the so - called ` cylindrical ' and ` displaced ' oscillator chains .",
    "a general hamiltonian of the @xmath9 vibron model with only one- and two - body interactions can be expressed in terms of linear and quadratic casimir operators of all the subalgebras contained in the dynamical symmetry algebra chains . to capture the essentials of the phase transition from the @xmath13-phase ( linear ) to the @xmath16-phase ( bent )",
    "it is enough to consider a convex combination of the linear @xmath35 and quadratic @xmath36 casimir operators of the corresponding dynamical symmetries . in particular",
    ", we shall consider the essential hamiltonian @xcite @xmath37 where the ( constant ) quantum number @xmath0 is the total number of bound states that labels the totally symmetric @xmath38 dimensional representation @xmath39 $ ] of @xmath9 .",
    "the hilbert space is spanned by the orthonormal basis vectors @xmath40 where the bending quantum number @xmath41 and the angular momentum @xmath42 or @xmath43 ( @xmath44odd or even ) are the eigenvalues of @xmath45 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath46 can be easily derived ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath47 from these matrix elements , it is easy to see that time evolution preserves the parity @xmath48 of a given state @xmath49 .",
    "that is , the parity operator @xmath50 commutes with @xmath51 and both operators can then be jointly diagonalized .",
    "parity symmetry in the vibron model has been considered in , for instance , ref .",
    "however , this symmetry goes unnoticed when proposing ansatzs to approximate the ground state energy in terms of ( non - symmetric ) ` projective ' @xcite ( or ` hartree axial ' @xcite ) css @xmath52 with @xmath53 a free variational parameter and @xmath54 the boson condensate .",
    "other rotationally equivalent possibilities can be also considered @xcite ; moreover , intrinsic excitations can also be constructed by replacing the intrinsic boson @xmath55 with orthogonal excitation bosons , thus defining multi - species css ( see e.g @xcite ) . in this article",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to ground state ansatzs .    for future use",
    ", we shall provide the explicit expression of the coefficients of the expansion of ( [ pcs ] ) in terms of the basis vectors ( [ basis ] ) , which is explicitly given by : @xmath56 the variational parameter @xmath57 is fixed by minimizing the ground state energy functional ` per particle ' @xcite : @xmath58 where we have used @xmath59 as a shorthand for expectation values in @xmath60 . from @xmath61 one gets the ` equilibrium radius ' @xmath62 and the ground state energy @xmath63 as a function of the control parameter @xmath8 : @xmath64 then one finds that @xmath65 is discontinuous at @xmath66 and the phase transition is said to be of second order . for triatomic molecules , the ( dimensionless ) algebraic variational coordinate @xmath57 has been related to a physical angular displacement @xcite ( or ` bending angle ' ) @xmath67 , with @xmath68 the equilibrium bond length , which reflects the degree of distortion of the molecular framework from linearity ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the displacement @xmath57 is also related to the coordinates of pschl - teller ( for the cylindrical oscillator ) and morse ( for the displaced cylindrical oscillator ) potentials . in",
    "we also see that @xmath57 provides a measure of the average vibrational @xmath70 and squared angular momentum @xmath71 quantum numbers .",
    "although @xmath72 properly describes the ground state energy density in the thermodynamic limit @xmath73 , we shall show that it does not capture the correct behavior for other ground state properties sensitive to the parity symmetry @xmath74 of the hamiltonian like , for instance , vibration - rotation entanglement and delocalization measures .",
    "this is why we introduce in this article parity - symmetry - adapted css .",
    "indeed , a far better variational description of the ground ( resp .",
    "first - excited ) state is given in terms of the even-(resp .",
    "odd)-parity projected ` projective ' css @xmath75 where @xmath76 is a normalization constant , with @xmath77 and we have used that @xmath78 , and therefore @xmath79 . note that the overlap @xmath80 is negligible for high @xmath0 ( thermodynamic limit ) and any @xmath81 ; therefore , in this limit , the states ( [ even - pproj ] ) are a superposition of two non - overlapping ( distinguishable ) quasi - classical ( coherent ) wave packets ( see @xcite and @xcite for a similar behavior in the dicke model ) .",
    "this justifies the term ` schrdinger catlike ' for these states .",
    "we shall only discuss the even ( ground state ansatz ) case here .",
    "expanding @xmath82 in the basis ( [ basis ] ) , as we did in ( [ csinbasis ] ) for non - symmetric css , we arrive to the new coefficients : @xmath83 note that now @xmath84 for @xmath85=odd .",
    "the variational parameter @xmath57 is again computed by minimizing the ground state energy functional ` per particle ' @xmath86 as in ( [ energyns ] ) , but now for the symmetric configuration @xmath82 , given in terms of the new mean values : @xmath87 unlike @xmath88 , the new energy functional @xmath89 depends on @xmath0 . from @xmath90",
    "we can obtain the new equilibrium radius @xmath91 .",
    "for example , for @xmath92 and @xmath93 we find analytic explicit expressions for the equilibrium radius and the ground state energy per particle as a function of the control parameter @xmath8 : @xmath94 for higher values of @xmath0 we can compute @xmath91 numerically .",
    "figure [ rop - s - ns ] compares @xmath95 in ( [ req1 ] ) with @xmath91 for @xmath96 .",
    "we observe that the equilibrium radius @xmath91 of the even - cat state @xmath82 approaches the equilibrium radius @xmath95 of the cs @xmath60 in the thermodynamic limit , that is , @xmath97 for @xmath73 .     of even - cat states for @xmath98 , where we are identifying @xmath99.,width=321 ]    moreover , one can also see ( figure [ energyn ] ) that the energy density @xmath100 of the even - cat state is a increasing function of @xmath0 and that it approaches the energy density @xmath101 of the cs in the thermodynamic limit , that is , @xmath102 for @xmath73 too .",
    "this behavior is displayed in figure [ energyn ] and it is also shared by the exact ( numerical ) density energy .",
    "therefore , even - cat states provide a ground state energy description of the finite - size @xmath103 regime .     of even - cat states for @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath18 , where we are identifying @xmath104.,width=302 ]    for future use ,",
    "let us finish the description of variational states by providing the explicit expression of the basis wave functions ( [ basis ] ) in ` position ' @xmath105 representation , with @xmath106 our three oscillator operators , in terms of hermite polynomials @xmath107 : @xmath108",
    "let us denote by @xmath109 the exact ground state of our system obtained by numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in terms of the basis vectors ( [ basis ] ) with coefficients @xmath110 , and by @xmath111 the corresponding wave function in position representation @xmath112 , written in terms of hermite polynomials .",
    "let us consider the bipartite system given by vibrational @xmath113 and 2d - rotational @xmath114 degrees of freedom .",
    "then , we can compute the reduced density matrix ( rdm ) for vibrational modes by integrating out the rotational degrees of freedom : @xmath115 the ` purity ' of @xmath116 is given by : @xmath117 where we have used orthogonality properties of the basis vectors ( [ basis ] ) and the coefficients of the expansion ( [ exactw ] ) .",
    "actually , the rdm @xmath116 is an @xmath118 diagonal matrix : @xmath119 with eigenvalues @xmath120 and the vibrational quantum number @xmath85 running from @xmath43 to @xmath0 . using the coefficients and for the ( non - symmetric ) coherent state ( cs ) and even - parity - adapted cs ( cat ) and , respectively",
    ", one can explicitly compute : @xmath121 the purity is then given in terms of hypergeometric functions as : @xmath122 instead of @xmath123 , we shall use , for instance , the linear entropy : @xmath124 as a measure of entanglement .",
    "since the size of @xmath116 is @xmath125 , the linear entropy @xmath126 then ranges between @xmath43 ( pure state ) and @xmath127 ( completely mixed state ) .",
    "figure [ entangn8 - 20 ] compares the exact ( numerical ) linear entropy with that of the cs and cat states ( [ csinbasis ] ) and ( [ even - pproj ] ) , respectively .     with the coherent state ( top ) and even - cat ( bottom )",
    "variational approximations as a function of @xmath8 for @xmath128.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]   with the coherent state ( top ) and even - cat ( bottom ) variational approximations as a function of @xmath8 for @xmath128.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    one can see that linear entropy for the cs configuration gives wrong results in both phases . especially , in the second ( bent ) phase for the maximal value at @xmath15 , we have @xmath129 which can be computed by taking into account that @xmath130 . a much better agreement ( remarkably for high @xmath0 )",
    "is reached through the even - cat configuration , with linear entropy at @xmath15 given by : @xmath131 where we have also used that @xmath132 .",
    "here we have made the approximation @xmath133}\\binom{n}{2\\nu}^2\\simeq",
    "\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=0}^{n}\\binom{n}{n}^2= \\frac{1}{2}\\binom{2n}{n},\\ ] ] with @xmath134=$]floor@xmath135 , which is quite accurate even for relatively small values of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we have that the purity of the rdm for the even - cat is essentially half the purity for the cs at @xmath15 ; a simple correction with important consequences that makes ( [ linentsymxi1 ] ) a very good estimate for the entanglement linear entropy as a function of @xmath0 in the rigidly bent phase @xcite . moreover , @xmath136 ( maximal entanglement ) for the rigidly bent phase ( @xmath15 ) in the thermodynamic limit @xmath18 . in order to better evaluate the purity degree of our rdm for even - cat states , particularly for large @xmath0 and rigidly bent molecules , @xmath15",
    ", we can use the stirling s approximation @xmath137 which says that vibrational and rotational modes in the exact ground state ( and in the even - cat variational approximation ) are entangled but not maximally entangled in the bent phase for finite @xmath0 , since the purity for a maximally entangled state is @xmath138 . in the ` floppy region '",
    "@xcite , @xmath139 , the linear entropy seems to converge to a non - zero value in the thermodynamic limit . for rigidly linear molecules",
    "@xmath12 , the vibration - rotation entanglement linear entropy is zero .    for completeness",
    ", we also provide in figure [ vonneun8 - 20 ] a comparative plot for the von neumann entropy @xmath140 the qualitative behavior of @xmath141 is quite similar to that of @xmath126 .",
    "actually , one can see again that von neumann entropy for the cs configuration gives wrong results in both phases .",
    "in particular , for high @xmath0 and rigidly bent molecules , @xmath15 , von neumann entropy behaves like : @xmath142 denoting a von neumann entropy excess of 1 of the cs with respect to the cat and exact configurations .     with the coherent state ( top ) and even - cat ( bottom )",
    "variational approximations as a function of @xmath8 for @xmath128.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]   with the coherent state ( top ) and even - cat ( bottom ) variational approximations as a function of @xmath8 for @xmath128.,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    at this point one could still think that the cs approximation , albeit wrong for finite @xmath0 , still captures the essence of the growth of entanglement .",
    "therefore , one could ask himself whether parity is really essential to properly describe the ground state of vibron models in the thermodynamic limit or not . to answer this question positively",
    ", we need to provide a quantity from the ground state which is strongly sensitive to parity .",
    "this quantity turns out to be the ` inverse participation ratio ' ( ipr ) : @xmath143 we can interpret the ipr as a measure of the spread or delocalization of a wave function @xmath144 over a particular basis ( here the position eigenfunctions @xmath145 ) , much in the same way the von neumann entropy is a measure of the spread of a density matrix @xmath146 over its diagonal basis . from figure [ ipr8 - 20 ]",
    "we see that the exact ( numerical ) ground state wave function exhibits a sudden delocalization across the phase transition , a spread that is also captured by the even - cat but goes unnoticed in the case of the cs ansatz ( [ pcs],[csinbasis ] ) , for which the ipr remains constant with the control parameter @xmath8 .",
    "this kind of behavior is also shared by the ground state in the dicke model @xcite , where the wave packet in the normal phase splits up into two ( almost ) non - overlapping sub - packets in the super - radiant phase ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . here",
    "too , the overlap goes to zero for @xmath7 ( @xmath81 ) in the thermodynamic limit @xmath147 , so that the ground state wave function is a linear superposition of two ( almost ) non - overlapping sub - packets in the bent phase .     with the coherent state ( dashed - constant ) and even - cat ( dotted )",
    "variational approximations as a function of @xmath8 for @xmath148 and @xmath149.,width=321 ]    for completeness , we also provide the ipr @xmath150 over the basis for the cs and cat ansatzs in terms of hypergeometric functions : @xmath151",
    "we have obtained exact ( numerical ) results of entanglement and delocalization of the ground state in 2d vibron models for finite-(@xmath0)-size molecules .",
    "these two features provide sharp indicators of the shape qpt present in this model , denoting an abrupt change in the structure of the ground state at the critical point @xmath1 .    this result has been complemented and compared with two variational approximations ( parity - symmetric and non - symmetric ) which enrich the study .",
    "even - parity ( cat ) configurations turn out to give a remarkably good variational description of entanglement measures ( linear and von neumann entropies ) , quantitatively reproducing the exact values for the entanglement entropy in the rigidly ( linear and bent ) phases and qualitatively capturing the entanglement entropy behavior in the `` floppy '' ( intermediate ) region .",
    "results reveal the emergence of vibration - rotation entanglement in the bent phase of vibron models , where vibrational and rotational modes are entangled but not maximally entangled .    unlike other ansatzs in the literature , these schrdinger s cat states",
    "do capture a delocalization of the ground state wave packet through the ipr @xmath152 across the phase transition , thus proving the relevance of parity symmetry for a proper description of the ground state in vibron models .    as a general comment",
    ", we know that entanglement is a crucial resource for information processing , being at the heart of quantum communication protocols and quantum computing efficient algorithms .",
    "although the work we present here is theoretical , there arises the natural question about an eventual experimental feasibility of the obtained vibration - rotation entanglement for quantum information processes .",
    "we know that phonon - roton scattering , emission and absorption has been extensively studied in helium superfluid and we think that it is worth exploring this new possibility in molecules .",
