    "manipulating the time evolution of a quantum system is a major task required for quantum information processing .",
    "several strategies for the control of a quantum system have been proposed in the past decade@xcite , which can be divided into coherent and incoherent control , according to how the controls enter the dynamics . among the quantum control strategies",
    ", lyapunov control plays an important role in quantum control theory .",
    "several papers have be published recently to discuss the application of lyapunov control to quantum systems@xcite .",
    "although the basic mathematical formulism for lyapunov control is well established , many questions remain when one considers its applications in quantum information processing , for instance , the lyapunov control on open system and the state manipulation in its decoherence - free subspace .    as a collection of states that undergo unitary evolution in the presence of decoherence , the decoherence - free subspaces ( dfs )  @xcite and noiseless subsystem(ns)@xcite are promising concept in quantum information processing",
    ". experimental realizations of dfs have been achieved with photons  @xcite and in nuclear spin systems  @xcite .",
    "a decoherence - free quantum memory for one qubit has been realized experimentally with two trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "an in - depth study of quantum stabilization problems for dfs and ns of markovian quantum dynamics was presented in@xcite .",
    "most recently , we have proposed a scheme to drive an open quantum system into the decoherence - free subspaces@xcite .",
    "this scheme works also for closed quantum system , by replacing the dfs with a desired subspace .",
    "the result suggests that it is possible to drive a quantum system to a set of states ( for example , the dfs in the paper ) , however it is difficult to manipulate the system into a definite quantum state in the dfs .",
    "the aim of this paper is to design a lyapunov control to drive an open system to a definite state in the dfs .",
    "the lyapunov control has been proven to be a sufficient simple control to be analyzed rigorously , in particular , the control can be shown to be highly effective for systems that satisfy certain sufficient conditions , which roughly speaking are equivalent to the controllability of the linearized system . in lyapunov control ,",
    "lyapunov functions which were originally used in feedback control to analyze the stability of the control system , have formed the basis for new control design . by properly choosing the lyapunov function ,",
    "our analysis and numerical simulations show that the control scheme works good .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ gf ] , we present a general analysis of lyapunov control for open quantum systems , lyapunov functions and control fields are given and discussed . to illustrate the general formulism , we exemplify a four - level system with 2-dimensional dfs in sec .",
    "[ exa ] , showing that the system can be controlled to a desired state in the dfs by lyapunov control .",
    "finally , we conclude our results in sec .",
    "we can model a controlled quantum system either by a closed system , or by an open system governed by a master equation . in this paper , we restrict our discussion to a @xmath0-dimensional open quantum system , and consider its dynamics as markovian and therefore the dynamics obeys the markovian master equation ( @xmath1 throughout this paper ) , @xmath2+{\\mathcal l}(\\rho ) , \\label{mef}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3+[l_m\\rho , l_m^{\\dagger}]),$ ] @xmath4 .",

    "@xmath6 are jump operators .",
    "@xmath7 is a free hamiltonian and @xmath8 are control hamiltonian , while @xmath9 are control fields .",
    "equation ( [ mef ] ) is of lindblad form , this means that the solution to eq .",
    "( [ mef ] ) has all the required properties of a physical density matrix at all times .    by definition ,",
    "dfs is composed of states that undergo unitary evolution .",
    "considering the fact that there are many ways for a quantum system to evolve unitarily , we focus on the dfs here that the dissipative part @xmath10 of the master equation is zero , leading to the following conditions for dfs@xcite . a space spanned by @xmath11 if and only if ( 1 ) @xmath12 is invariant under @xmath7 ; ( 2 ) @xmath13 and ( 3 ) @xmath14 for all @xmath15 and @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 with these notations , the goal of this paper can be formulated as follows .",
    "we wish to apply a specified set of control fields @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ mef ] ) such that @xmath20 evolves into a desired state in the dfs and stays there forever .",
    "in contrast to the conventional control problem@xcite , we here develop the control strategy to open system .",
    "we use @xmath21 as a lyapunov function , where @xmath22 is hermitian and time - independent .",
    "first , we analyze the structure of critical points for @xmath23 with restriction @xmath24 to determine the structure of @xmath23 around one of its critical points , for example @xmath25 , we consider a finite variation @xmath26 such that @xmath27 here we denote the normalized eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath22 by @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , respectively .",
    "express @xmath31 in the basis of the eigenvectors of @xmath32 @xmath33 follows , @xmath34 then @xmath35 considering @xmath36 as variation parameters and noting @xmath37 we find that the structure of @xmath23 around the critical point @xmath38 depends on the ordering of the eigenvalues : @xmath38 is a local maximum as a function of the variations @xmath36 if and only if @xmath39 is the largest eigenvalue , a local minimum iff @xmath39 is the smallest eigenvalue and a saddle point otherwise . this observation leads us to suspect that the minimum of @xmath40 is asymptotically attractive , in other words , the control field based on this lyapunov function would drive the open system to the eigenstate of @xmath22 with the smallest eigenvalue .",
    "we will show through an example that this is exactly the case .",

    "the choice of @xmath44=0 $ ] implies that @xmath7 and @xmath22 must have the same eigenvectors , then the control field would drive the open system into an eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath7 . to make @xmath48 we choose a @xmath49 such that @xmath50\\rho)},\\nonumber\\\\ & & f_j(t)=-i\\kappa_j({\\text{tr}}([\\hat{a},h_j]\\rho))^ * , \\ \\",

    "it should be emphasized that @xmath54 always exists . to find @xmath54 , @xmath55\\rho)\\neq 0 $ ]",
    "is required .",
    "this can be done by construction .",
    "now we show that @xmath54 is real . by the definition of @xmath56 , @xmath56 is hermite , then @xmath57 can be treated as the time derivative of @xmath58 and thus is real . identifying @xmath22 with a hermitian operator for a system described by the hamiltonian @xmath59",

    ", we can show that all the control fields are real as long as the control hamiltonian @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) are hermitian .    by the lasalle s invariant principle@xcite , the autonomous dynamical system eq.([nle1 ] )",
    "converges to an invariant set defined by @xmath64 .",
    "this set is in general not empty and of finite dimension , indicating that it is easy to manipulate an open system to a set of states but difficult to control it from an arbitrary initial state to a given target state .",
    "fortunately , by elaborately designing the control hamiltonian and the operator @xmath22 , we can solve this problem as follows .",

    "in this case , the invariant set is a collection of state @xmath73 that satisfies @xmath74=0.$ ] considering that only the states in dfs are stable , we claim that we can manipulate the system from any initial state to the target state in dfs . in other words , we can design @xmath22 such that @xmath75 contains only the target state .",
    "we emphasis that although the control field @xmath49 was specified to cancel @xmath76 in @xmath77 , it makes contribution to the dynamics of the open system .",
    "as an example of the lyapunov control strategy , we discuss below a four - level system coupling to two external lasers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] ,    the hamiltonian of such a system has the form @xmath78 where @xmath79 are coupling constants . without loss of generality , in the following the coupling constants",
    "are parameterized as @xmath80 and @xmath81 with @xmath82 the excited state @xmath83 is not stable , it decays to the three stable states with rates @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "we assume this process is markovian and can be described by the liouvillian , @xmath87 with @xmath88 and @xmath89 it is not difficult to find that the two degenerate dark states latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     @xmath7 form a dfs .",

    "we should emphasis that it is difficult to exhaust all possible initial states in the simulation , because for a 4-dimensional system , there are 15 independent real parameters needed to describe a general state , even for pure states , 6 real independent parameters are required . the initial state written in eq.([inis ] ) omits all ( three ) relative phases between the states @xmath98 here is specified to cancel the contribution of @xmath99 $ ] to @xmath100 this means that @xmath101\\rho)},$ ] @xmath102 and @xmath103 are determined by eq.([fs ] ) .",
    "we have performed extensive numerical simulation with the initial states eq.([inis ] ) .",

    "[ f2]-[f4 ] .",
    "the control field @xmath103 plays an important role in this scheme as fig .",
    "[ f2 ] shows .",
    "[ f2 ] tells us that without the control field @xmath103 , the open system can be driven into the dfs ( with @xmath22 given below ) , but it can not be manipulated into a definite state in dfs .",
    "the physics behind is the following . with the given @xmath22 ( see below )",
    ", @xmath104 is always zero , so @xmath105 plays no role in the control . the only control that enters the system is @xmath106 . from eq.([fs ] ) , we find that @xmath102 takes zero provided @xmath107 ( where @xmath108 , leading to the above observation . when the control field @xmath103 is turned on .",
    "the four - level system can be controlled to a desired state in dfs by properly choosing @xmath109    for example , when @xmath110 the system can be controlled into @xmath111 ( see fig.[f3 ] ) , whereas @xmath112 can drive the system into @xmath113 ( see fig.[f4 ] ) .",
    "based on the formalism in sec .",
    "[ gf ] , @xmath114 together with the controls could drive the system to the eigenstate of @xmath115 with smallest eigenvalue ( namely , @xmath111 ) , and to @xmath113 with @xmath116 as figure 4 shows , however , the fidelity is not 1 for some initial states , for example @xmath117 the reason is as follows .",
    "though the choice of @xmath112 benefits the target state @xmath113 , since @xmath113 is the eigenstate of @xmath22 with smallest eigenvalue , the control @xmath118 does not favor the control target @xmath113 , because @xmath119 couples the states @xmath83 and @xmath113 , and @xmath83 decays to the three stable states equally .",
    "this observation suggests that @xmath120 instead of @xmath119 could help the control when the target is @xmath121 indeed further numerical simulations confirm this prediction that the control @xmath122 can drive the system into @xmath113 with almost perfect fidelity @xmath123 .",
    "the fidelity of the open system in the target state depends on the strength @xmath124 of the control @xmath125 the dependence is plotted in fig.[f5 ] . with large @xmath126",
    ", the system would asymptotically converge to the target state as fig.[f5 ] shows . as expected , the control fields @xmath102 and @xmath103 tend to zero when the open system converges to the target state , see fig.[f6 ]",
    "in summary , we have proposed a scheme to manipulate an open quantum system in the decoherence - free subspaces .",
    "this study was motivated by the fact that for lyapunov control , it is usually difficult to optimally control the system from an arbitrary initial state to a given target state , this is due to the lasalle s invariant principle .",
    "our present study suggests that it is possible to drive a quantum system to a desired state in dfs by elaborately designing the controls .",
    "the results do not break the lasalle s role , instead it reduces the invariant set @xmath72 to include the target state only . to demonstrate the proposal we exemplify a four - level system and numerically simulate the controlled dynamics .",
    "the dependence of the fidelity on initial states as well as the control fields are calculated and discussed .",
    "this scheme put the lyapunov control on quantum open system one step forward , and shed light on the quantum control in dfs .",
