    "the no - cloning theorem  @xcite is an important property of quantum mechanics which follows from the linear structure of the theory . in its weaker version",
    "the no - cloning theorem formalizes the physical impossibility of creating a machine that produces exact copies of an unknown , given quantum state .",
    "more generally it prevents us to construct a machine such that , randomly choosing one of two non - orthogonal states of a system , it will produce perfect copies of such state .",
    "together with entanglement ( of which it is a direct consequence ) the no - cloning theorem contributed in modifying our approach to information theory and in refining our intuition about quantum - based information processing  @xcite with profound consequences both in quantum computation and in quantum communication .",
    "in particular it played an important role in the development of quantum error correction techniques  @xcite by preventing one from having codes that create redundant copies of every state of a quantum system .    in recent years several generalizations of the no - cloning theorem have been proposed to include the possibility of imperfect copies .",
    "in particular this yielded a proof of the impossibility of cloning with arbitrary high fidelity  @xcite an unknown quantum state .",
    "furthermore , barnum _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced the idea of _ quantum broadcasting _ to deal with mixed input state . differently from the original setup  @xcite , in a broadcasting scenario it is not required to produce factorizable copies of the original input states .",
    "instead one is allowed to create a joint ( possible entangled ) many - body output state composed by subsystems which locally reproduce the original input state . in this settings",
    "it has been shown that quantum broadcasting is still prohibited in the case of single input copy and two output copies  @xcite but can be done when starting from a sufficient number of copies  @xcite .",
    "no - cloning and quantum broadcasting proved to be an important investigation tool for characterizing the quantum capacity  @xcite of quantum communication channels  @xcite . using these results in conjunction with the _ degradability _ properties  @xcite of a quantum communication line",
    "one can show that channels which are _ anti - degradable _  @xcite must have zero quantum capacity ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we would like to discuss a weaker version of broadcasting that we name _ quantum shared broadcasting _ ( qsb ) . in its simplest form",
    "the scheme is described in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . as in the standard broadcasting scenario",
    "we have a source system @xmath0 which provide us with a set of unknown input states @xmath1 that we would like to duplicate into two output systems i and ii . in the present case",
    "however we do not require the output systems to be independent .",
    "instead we assume a partial _ overlap _ between them .",
    "as shown in the picture , we parameterize such overlap by introducing a subsystem @xmath2 which belongs to both the output systems and representing i and ii as the composed systems @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively ( here @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two independent spaces ) .",
    "qsb succeeds when , for a given unknown input state @xmath7 of @xmath0 , the output density matrix of @xmath8 is such that both its restrictions on i@xmath9 and ii@xmath10 contain a copy of @xmath7 .",
    "as we will see the possibility of realizing such a transformation strongly depends upon the dimensionality of the shared subsystem @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , perfect shared broadcasting ( i.e. a qsb which produces perfect copies of the states @xmath7 ) can not be achieved if @xmath2 is smaller than the source system @xmath0 , while it is trivially allowed if @xmath0 fits in @xmath2 .",
    "similar results apply in the case of imperfect qsb where one is interested in getting only approximated copies of the @xmath7s : in this case we provide a threshold which connects the achievable fidelity and the dimension of @xmath2 .    as in the case of no - cloning",
    ", the possibility of performing qsb transformations has profound consequences in quantum communication .",
    "in particular this appears to be a fundamental step for analyzing the communication performances of joint channels .",
    "for instance qsb can be used to determine whether or not it is possible to boost the quantum communication efficiency of a given quantum channel by adding an anti - degradable ( zero - quantum capacity ) quantum channel to it . even though the quantum channel capacity seems to be a super - additive quantity  @xcite , anti - degradable channels",
    "play probably the role of neutral elements in this context .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section  [ s : perfect ] analyzing the case of perfect broadcasting showing that this is possible only if the source system @xmath0 can fit within the overlap subsystem @xmath2 . in section  [ s : imperfect ]",
    "instead we focus on the imperfect broadcasting case providing a threshold which connects the dimension of @xmath2 with the fidelity of the two copies with the input state .",
    "the paper then ends with a perspectives and conclusions section .",
    "let @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 be quantum systems described by the hilbert spaces @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 having dimensions @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively .",
    "we call @xmath0 the source system and @xmath2 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 the output systems . without loss of generality we will assume that @xmath19 and @xmath20 . under these hypothesis",
    "it is always possible to find isometries @xmath21 and @xmath22 connecting @xmath11 to @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , that allow us to `` represent '' states of @xmath0 as states of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in finding a completely positive , trace preserving ( cpt ) map @xmath25 from @xmath0 to @xmath26 which would allow us to `` copy '' any vector of @xmath11 into @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "specifically , given @xmath27 let us define the density matrix @xmath28 with @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath30 $ ] its reduced density matrices associated with @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "our goal is to find @xmath25 and isometries @xmath31 and @xmath32 such that the fidelities  @xcite among the input state @xmath1 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 are equal to one for all input states @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are respectively the `` representations '' of @xmath1 defined in terms of the isometries @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "a channel @xmath25 which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ afa ] ) for all @xmath1 of @xmath11 is said to be a perfect quantum shared broadcasting map .",
    "standard broadcasting  @xcite can be obtained from this by constraining @xmath25 to act trivially on @xmath2 requiring for instance that @xmath39 to be of the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 fixed .",
    "we shall see that the possibility of achieving shared broadcasting strongly depends upon the ratio between the dimensions of the source space @xmath0 and @xmath2 : if @xmath0 is small enough to entirely fit inside @xmath2 then a perfect qsb map exists , if instead @xmath0 is bigger than @xmath2 such a map can not be defined .",
    "* theorem 1 : * _ maps @xmath25 which perform perfect qsb exist if and only if @xmath2 is sufficiently big to contain @xmath0 , i.e. if and only if @xmath42 .",
    "when this happens @xmath25 can be chosen to be an isometry . _    _",
    "proof : _ showing that @xmath25 exists when @xmath42 is trivial .",
    "indeed when this happens there exists always an isometry @xmath43 which connects @xmath11 with @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 , for all @xmath1 .",
    "expand then @xmath43 to construct the isometry @xmath21 from @xmath11 and @xmath46 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ afa ] ) . this can be done for instance by imposing the conditions @xmath47 , with @xmath48 being some reference vector of @xmath5 .",
    "do the same for @xmath49 by introducing a reference vector @xmath50 on @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "consider then the transformation which for @xmath35 gives @xmath52 .",
    "this is clearly cpt since it is an isometry .",
    "moreover it satisfies the conditions  ( [ afa ] ) .",
    "let us now consider the case in which @xmath53 .",
    "we will prove the thesis by contradiction showing that if such @xmath54 does exist then one can violate the standard no - broadcasting theorem for vectors belonging to a two - dimensional subspace @xmath55 of @xmath11  i.e. it would be possible to construct a broadcasting machine that creates two perfect copies ( one in @xmath5 and the other in @xmath6 ) of any vectors of @xmath56 .",
    "we start observing that the condition ( [ afa ] ) implies that the density matrices @xmath33 and @xmath34 are pure .",
    "specifically , for @xmath57 we must have @xmath58 .",
    "this implies immediately that the global density matrix @xmath39 can be written as @xmath59 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 density matrices which ( in principle ) may still depend upon @xmath1 .",
    "take then the partial trace with respect to @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) of both the second and the third term of eq .",
    "( [ xxx1 ] ) . by doing",
    "so one arrives to the conclusion that for all @xmath1 , _",
    "i ) _ @xmath62 must be pure , _ ii ) _",
    "@xmath62 must be separable with respect to @xmath2 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "that is @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are ( not necessarily identical ) normalized vectors of @xmath44 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 whose dependence upon the input @xmath1 will be determined in the following .",
    "for @xmath57 this gives @xmath67 which , due to eq .",
    "( [ afa ] ) , fixes the action of the isometries @xmath21 and @xmath22 by imposing the conditions @xmath68 apply this to an orthonormal basis @xmath69 of @xmath11 , i.e. @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 defined as in eq .",
    "( [ xxx3 ] ) .",
    "since isometries preserve inner product we must have @xmath73 for all @xmath74 .",
    "now we remind that the maximum number of mutually orthonormal vectors in @xmath2 is @xmath16 . therefore since @xmath75",
    ", there must exist at least a couple of @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( say @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) such that @xmath80 . consequently eq .",
    "( [ xxx5 ] ) implies that @xmath81 consider then the two - dimensional subspace @xmath82 generated by @xmath83 and @xmath84 , i.e. the set of normalized vectors @xmath85 . from eq .",
    "( [ xxx3rrr ] ) and the linearity of @xmath86 follows that their `` representations '' on @xmath87 are @xmath88 according to eq .",
    "( [ xxx3 ] ) this should be separable with respect to the bipartition @xmath89 . from the orthogonality conditions  ( [ xxx65 ] ) this is only possible if @xmath90 for some ( irrelevant ) phase @xmath91 .",
    "hence for all vectors of @xmath56 we can write @xmath92 with @xmath93 and @xmath94 being isometries which map @xmath56 into @xmath5 and @xmath6 according to the rules @xmath95 , @xmath96 . replacing this into eq .",
    "( [ xxx31 ] ) we have finally @xmath97 which shows that the vectors @xmath98 have been copied into @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this is impossible due to the no - broadcasting theorem .",
    "therefore @xmath25 can not exist .",
    "a simple generalization of the perfect qsb protocol introduced in the previous section is obtained by requiring the fidelities among the output copies and the input states to be higher than a certain fixed threshold :    * definition 1 : * _ given @xmath100}$ ] we say that @xmath101-qsb from @xmath0 to @xmath8 is possible if there exists a channel @xmath102 and isometries @xmath103 such that for an arbitrary input state @xmath104 we have _ @xmath105 _ where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 are defined as in eq .",
    "( [ afa ] ) .",
    "we say that approximated quantum shared broadcasting ( aqsb ) from @xmath0 is possible if for any @xmath108 $ ] one can find subsystems @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , channel @xmath112 and isometries @xmath113 which realize an @xmath101-qsb of @xmath0 . _    in the following sections we will give conditions which relate @xmath101 to @xmath16 and @xmath15 that are necessary for implementing @xmath101-qsb protocols and hence aqsb .",
    "before doing so we notice however that if @xmath114 _ and _ the dimensionality of @xmath115 is bounded then impossibility of aqsb follows from the impossibility of perfect qsb .",
    "this can be shown by contradiction by noticing that if aqsb would be possible than the sets of channels @xmath116 and isometries @xmath117 , @xmath118 would be compact . therefore letting @xmath119 one will find a limiting channel @xmath120 and limiting isometries @xmath121 , @xmath122 which fulfill the perfect qsb impossibility of which",

    "[ s : perfect ] .      to deal with the approximations of eq .",
    "( [ afa0000 ] ) we find it useful to review some basic properties of the fidelity that will be extensively used in the remaining part of the manuscript :    * _ transitivity : _ let @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 be density matrices , then the following triangle inequality holds @xmath126 which shows that if @xmath123 and @xmath124 are `` close '' to @xmath125 then they must be `` close '' to each other too .",
    "equation  ( [ tri ] ) can be established by relating @xmath127 with the trace distance @xmath128 through the inequality @xmath129  @xcite .",

    "if @xmath101-qsb could be realized for arbitrarily small @xmath101 , then the fidelity of such copies with the input states would become arbitrarily close to one .",
    "this however is prevented by the fact that the fidelities of _ any _ @xmath260 cloning devices are bounded from above by the value @xmath261  @xcite . by comparing this with eq .",
    "( [ water1 ] ) , and by taking into account the condition @xmath262 introduced in eq .",
    "( [ titti ] ) , we get the threshold of eq .",
    "( [ varevare ] ) : for values of @xmath101 smaller than such @xmath179 we can hence conclude that @xmath101-qsb maps can not be implemented .",
    "this complete the proof of theorem 2 .",
    "quantum broadcasting protocols have been generalized to include the possibility of producing output copies on partially overlapping systems . in this context",
    "we have shown that perfect quantum shared broadcasting is possible if and only if the overlap among the output systems is sufficiently large to include all possible input states .",
    "we have also analyzed the case of imperfect copies proving the existence of a finite upper bound @xmath179 on the achievable fidelities below which no approximated qsb can be performed when @xmath75 . since the derivation of such threshold has been obtained by imposing only some of ( but not all ) the necessary conditions on the output states of the channels the reported value for @xmath179 is probably not optimal .",
