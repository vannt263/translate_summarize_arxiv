    "one of the challenges with the sdss samples has been the ability to accurately compare the sloan photometry to the johnson - cousins standards for low - mass stars that are used in other studies .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2002 ) previously investigated the stellar sdss / johnson - cousins color transformation using the 158 sdss standard stars .",
    "however , the sdss standard stars only extend to an @xmath0 @xmath1 1.5 ( spectral type @xmath2m4 ) .",

    "unfortunately , neither of these new sets of relations extend far beyond @xmath3 and therefore are not useful for cool - star studies .    in another study ,",
    "walkowicz , hawley & west ( 2004 ) projected sloan filter curves onto spectra of stars with measured johnson - cousins photometry in order to derive color transformations between the two systems . although the walkowicz et al .",
    "method has its utility and has been used by several subsequent studies ( west et al .",
    "2004 ; west , walkowicz & hawley 2005 ; silvestri et al . 2006 ) , it is not the ideal method for deriving color transformations .",
    "walkowicz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) also derived a relation between sloan colors and absolute magnitude for stars with measured parallaxes .",
    "however , this relation used the intermediate step of estimating the sloan colors from either the spectral type of the star or the aforementioned transformations .",
    "no stars with known parallaxes were observed directly with both filter sets .    in this paper , we undertake the more ideal solution of observing a set of low - mass dwarfs with the same telescope in both johnson - cousins and sloan filters and using these data to derive a new set of color transformations",
    ". a subset of our stars have measured parallaxes and 2mass photometry and we use these data to derive sdss / johnson - cousins/2mass color transformations as well as new photometric parallax relations for all three systems . in  2 , we describe our sample selection .",
    "we detail our observations in  3 and present our results in  4 .",
    "we discuss these our results and possibilities for the future in  5 .",
    "the sdss / johnson - cousins color transformation sub - sample was selected from the sdss data release 4 ( dr4 ; abazajian et al .",

    "we selected the 5 brightest , observable ( based on ra ) stars from every 0.1 bin in @xmath0 color ( if 5 existed ) , resulting in a sample of 23 stars .",
    "the sample was then divided into a `` blue '' sample ( @xmath7 1.4 ; 11 stars ) and a `` red '' sample ( @xmath8 1.4 ; 12 stars ) .",
    "the parallax sub - sample is composed of 17 stars selected from the general catalogue of trigonometric stellar parallaxes ( van altena , lee & hoffleit 1995 ) .",
    "we first queried the catalog for those stars with small parallax errors ( @xmath9 ) and late spectral types ( k0 and later ) .",
    "the final sub - sample was selected to span as large a range of spectral types as possible , while maximizing observational efficiency ( including both location on the sky and stellar magnitude ) .",
    "2mass photometry was obtained from the 2mass point source catalog ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) and the johnson - cousin colors were taken from the pmsu i ( reid et al .",
    "observations were carried out during the summer of 2005 using the university of washington 30-inch telescope at manastash ridge observatory ( mro ) .",

    "standard stars were observed to derive extinction coefficients and photometric zero - points . every sample and standard star",
    "was observed long enough to obtain a minimum of 10000 counts , and therefore a 1% photon noise uncertainty .",
    "the mro photometric camera was shown to be linear over the entire magnitude range of our observations .",
    "the data were reduced using the standard iraf packages .",
    "all sloan bands were reduced to the sdss 2.5 m system ( unprimed ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the derived extinction coefficients dominates the reported photometric uncertainties .    for the sdss selected sample",
    ", we observed each star using both the johnson - cousins @xmath12 filters and the sloan @xmath13 filters .",
    "for the blue sample , we added a johnson - cousins @xmath14 filter and for the red sample the @xmath15 filter was included . because the stars in the sdss selected sample already had sdss photometry ,",
    "the mro @xmath16 data allow us ensure that our photometry is correctly on the proper sdss system .",
    "we find that the @xmath0 colors have a mean difference of 0.054 mags and an rms scatter of 0.165 mags , while the @xmath17 colors have a mean offset of -0.002 mags and an rms scatter of 0.220 mags .",
