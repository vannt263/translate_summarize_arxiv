    "extensive studies of @xmath0 production in the @xmath5 reaction were carried out in the 1970s at the nimrod synchrotron from the kinematic threshold up to @xmath0 cm momenta of @xmath6  mev/@xmath7  @xcite .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 were studied with the same apparatus , no similar effects were found in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 cases and a threshold enhancement , rather than a suppression , was observed for the @xmath13 .",
    "first , a final state interaction ( fsi ) effect , where one of the pions from the @xmath0 decay scatters off the recoiling neutron , was suggested as a possible explanation for the @xmath0 threshold suppression  @xcite .",
    "this explanation was however tested and abandoned in keyne _",

    "the data available for @xmath0 production in @xmath1he@xmath16 are rather scarce .",
    "the reaction was first studied near its kinematic threshold at saturne  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section at @xmath17  mev ( @xmath18  mev/@xmath7 ) measured in the forward and backward regions with the spesiii spectrometer  @xcite showed clear anisotropy in @xmath19 , with strong peaking at extreme angles .",
    "this is in contrast to the angular distributions observed in @xmath20 , which remain flat up to at least @xmath21  mev/@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "measured the @xmath22he@xmath2 cross section at @xmath23 as a function of energy using the spesiv spectrometer at saturne  @xcite and found a suppression in the production amplitude near threshold similar to the one observed in the @xmath24 reaction  @xcite .",
    "these authors also described their data in terms of the fsi hypothesis .",
    "however , the correctness of this interpretation has been questioned for both reactions in ref .",
    "@xcite , where effects associated with the @xmath0 width have been stressed .",
    "the production of heavy mesons in @xmath25 collisions has been studied theoretically in a two - step model  @xcite , which first involves the production of a light meson in the interaction between the incident and one of the target nucleons . in the second step ,",
    "the light meson interacts with the other target nucleon to create the observed heavy meson .",
    "this procedure allows the large momentum transfer to be shared between the nucleons .",
    "the predictions of this model have been evaluated for the specific @xmath22he@xmath2 reaction  @xcite , but only at the backward angles where data existed  @xcite , and no previous attempts have been made to calculate the full angular distribution .    in this paper ,",
    "the results of the measurements of @xmath0 production in the @xmath22he@xmath2 reaction by the celsius / wasa collaboration are presented at two different beam kinetic energies , @xmath17  mev and @xmath26  mev .",
    "these correspond , respectively , to @xmath0 cm momenta of @xmath27  mev/@xmath7 and @xmath28  mev/@xmath7 , _ i.e. _ , excess energies of 63  mev and 17  mev .",
    "we have previously reported data on the angular distribution of the @xmath0 decay plane that show that the @xmath0 is produced largely unpolarized  @xcite , which is in stark contrast to the almost complete polarization of the @xmath12 from the analogous @xmath22he@xmath29 reaction  @xcite .",
    "we now provide the corresponding results on the differential cross sections that have been measured over the full angular range .",
    "these new data constitute an important input to the intriguing question of how heavy mesons are produced in few - body collisions and , in particular , whether the reaction can be usefully viewed as a sequential two - step process .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we start by introducing the wasa detector before going through the analysis in some detail .",
    "this involves principally the @xmath30he identification , event selection , background , and normalization procedure . after describing the acceptance corrections",
    ", we show our results and compare them to calculations that have been performed in terms of a two - step model .",
    "the measurements of the @xmath22he@xmath31 reaction were carried out at the the svedberg laboratory in uppsala , sweden , using the wasa detector  @xcite which , until june 2005 , was an integral part of the celsius storage ring .",
    "a deuterium pellet target  @xcite was used in combination with a proton beam .",
    "the @xmath30he were detected in the wasa forward detector ( fd ) , which covers laboratory polar angles from @xmath32 to @xmath33 with respect to the beam direction . the forward detector consists of a sector - like window counter ( fwc ) for triggering , a proportional chamber ( fpc ) for precise angular information , a trigger hodoscope ( fth ) for triggering and off - line particle identification , a range hodoscope ( frh ) for energy measurements , particle identification and triggering , an intermediate hodoscope ( fri ) for improved track reconstruction and neutron detection and finally a veto hodoscope ( fvh ) for triggering .",
    "all fd elements , except the fpc , are made of plastic scintillators .",
    "mesons and their decay products are detected mainly in the central detector ( cd ) , which consists of the plastic scintillating barrel ( psb ) , the mini drift chamber ( mdc ) , and the central scintillating electromagnetic calorimeter ( sec ) that is made of csi crystals .",
    "charged particles , such as pions from @xmath0 decay , are distinguished from neutral particles by their signals in the psb , which also provides angular determination from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "the momenta of charged particles are estimated by tracking in a magnetic field from the superconducting solenoid ( scs ) using information from the mdc .",
    "the sec measures angles and energies of photons from meson decays in the polar angle range from @xmath36 to @xmath37 . a schematic overview of the celsius / wasa detector setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wasa4pi ] .",
    "a special trigger was developed to select @xmath30he events , which are characterized by one high - energy - deposit hit in the fwc and one hit that overlaps in the azimuthal angle in one of the consecutive detectors .",
    "the @xmath30he ions are identified in the fd by the @xmath38 method . for this the scintillation light output in the detector layer where the particle stops is compared to that in the preceding layer .",
    "the particles then show up in different bands , as illustrated in fig .",

    "the scintillation light output is converted to energy deposit , taking into account the light quenching  @xcite .",
    "this allows the corresponding range to be estimated , which is added to the amount of material traversed by the particle in the preceding detector layers to give the total range .",
    "energy - range tables then allow the initial kinetic energy to be estimated .",
    "the expected light output in all the detector layers traversed is calculated and compared to the measured one by evaluating the @xmath39 , according to @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the layer number , @xmath42 the number of layers traversed , @xmath43 the measured light output , @xmath44 the calculated light output , and @xmath45 the light output uncertainty in a given layer .",

    "the intense spot at the bottom left corresponds to minimum ionizing particles . ]      in this work , we focus primarily on the @xmath47 decay channel because the large branching ratio ( br=89.1@xmath48 ) gives the high statistics required for the extraction of angular distributions .",
    "however , a parallel analysis of the @xmath49 decay channel ( br=8.7@xmath48 ) is a valuable tool for checking that cut efficiencies and other experimental biases are under control .      to select @xmath47 events",
    ", we require the @xmath30he ion to be measured in the fd with well defined energy and angle , which means that the @xmath30he has to stop within the frh . the geometrical acceptance of the fd is 95% at 1450  mev and 78% at 1360  mev . the main event loss is due to the @xmath30he emitted at small angles that escape down the beam pipe .",
    "the detection efficiency of the fd is further reduced by nuclear interactions in the detector material .",
    "the efficiency of detecting a @xmath30he from @xmath22he@xmath2 in the fd , as deduced from monte carlo simulations including geometry and detector material responses , is 61% and 54% at 1450 and 1360  mev , respectively .",
    "in addition to the @xmath30he selection , at least two photons are required in the sec .",
    "furthermore , one photon pair must have an invariant mass that does not differ from that of the @xmath51 by more than 45  mev/@xmath52 , and the missing mass of the @xmath30he@xmath53 system must be larger than 250  mev/@xmath52 , _ i.e. _ , twice the pion mass , after taking the resolution into account .",
    "finally , two or more hits are needed in the ps and the total energy deposit in the sec must not exceed 900 mev .",
    "this rejects candidates with photon signals from accidental events .",
    "these constraints give an overall acceptance of 35% at 1450  mev and 34% at 1360  mev .",

    "all final state particles , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath30he and three photons , can be measured with high acceptance in the @xmath57 case .",
    "each event is fully reconstructed , which ensures that the kinematical constraints are fulfilled . though this leads to a cleaner sample than the three - pion channel , the low branching ratio ( br=8.7@xmath48 ) yields statistics that are insufficient to provide angular distributions .",
    "having identified a @xmath30he and three photons , we demand that one photon pair has an invariant mass close to that of the @xmath51 , @xmath58  mev/@xmath52 , and that the invariant mass of all three photons is larger than 600  mev/@xmath52 .",
    "the missing - mass - squared of the @xmath30he@xmath59 system must not exceed @xmath60mev@xmath61 .",
    "we also require that the difference between the directions of the missing momentum of the @xmath30he and that of the 3@xmath62 system be smaller than 20@xmath63 . as in the three - pion case",
    ", a limit is placed on the total energy deposit in the sec , which may not exceed 1200 mev .",
    "finally , a coplanarity cut is applied : @xmath64he@xmath65 .",
    "these constraints reject very effectively the contribution from accidentals and events originating far from the target region .",
    "they give acceptances of 19% and 18% at 1450  mev and 1360  mev , respectively .      in the three - pion case ,",
    "the principal background is direct pion production , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath22he@xmath66 , which has exactly the same signature as @xmath0 production . the acceptance for this background , assuming phase space production , is 31% at 1450  mev and 35% at 1360  mev .",
    "both @xmath0 and direct @xmath67 events are produced mainly through the interaction of the beam with the pellet target .",
    "however , such reactions can also occur through interactions of the beam with the rest gas , the beam halo with the rest gas , and the beam halo with the beam pipe .",
    "rest gas is produced when the pellets are vaporized by the beam  @xcite or when the pellets are not properly captured in the pellet beam dump . in the present work",
    ", we found that around 30% of the data was not produced from the region of the pellet target .",
    "this is in line with the figures obtained from a recent measurement of the @xmath22he@xmath68 reaction at @xmath69  mev  @xcite .",
    "the vaporization of the pellet is expected to be higher at lower energies  @xcite , but the amount of rest gas also depends upon other time - dependent experimental conditions , such as the beam - target overlap , the efficiency of the vacuum pumps , and the performance of the pellet dump .",
    "since the energy reconstruction procedure assumes that all particles come from a well defined interaction point , the measured energy and momentum of particles produced far from the pellet target will have larger uncertainties and thus degrade the missing - mass resolution .",
    "however , the width of the @xmath0 peak agrees well with monte carlo simulations for a well defined interaction point , which means that most events come either from the target or from the close vicinity .",
    "the latter can be treated as good events that do not significantly affect the quality of the data sample .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that other channels , such as @xmath22he@xmath70 , @xmath22he@xmath71 and @xmath22he@xmath72 , give negligible contributions to the background and will be ignored .",
    "the main background channel in the @xmath73 sample comes from the @xmath22he@xmath71 reaction , where one of the photons escapes detection . assuming phase space production , about 1.8% of the @xmath74 events survive the cuts optimized for @xmath73 selection at 1450  mev and 1.4% at 1360  mev . although these are tiny fractions , the two - pion production cross section is large and the @xmath57 branching ratio small .",
    "hence it is expected that the numbers of events surviving the cuts should be of the same order of magnitude for the signal and background .",
    "interactions between the beam halo and the beam pipe , as well as chance coincidences , may also contribute to the background .",
    "however , we show in sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] that they only do so to a very limited extent .",
    "the luminosity depends on the beam intensity and the pellet rate , which are monitored and recorded during the data taking .",
    "however , the luminosity also depends on the overlap between the beam and target , which can not be measured directly .",
    "it is also not constant during a run or even over a cycle of data taking .",
    "furthermore , as previously mentioned , as many as 30% of the events may result from interactions away from the target .",
    "this means that the luminosity must be evaluated by normalizing the number of events of some subsidiary reaction to a well known cross section .",
    "quasi - elastic @xmath75 scattering might be a good choice because the cross section is well known and large statistics are available .",
    "however , these data were collected with a different trigger from the @xmath30he events and the relative trigger efficiency is not known with sufficient precision . it is therefore preferable to use a reaction with a @xmath30he in the final state , where the trigger was the same as for @xmath22he@xmath2 .",
    "the differential cross section for the @xmath22he@xmath68 reaction was measured at a few very backward angles with the spesiv spectrometer at 1450 , 1350 , and 1250  mev  @xcite .",
    "it was also measured over a larger angular range at 1450  mev with the spesiii spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "the two data sets agree well in the region of overlap .",
    "wasa has collected clean @xmath22he@xmath76 samples at 1450 and 1360  mev .",
    "in addition , we analyzed the @xmath22he@xmath68 reaction _ via _ the @xmath77 decay channel , which provided a cross check of the cut efficiency .",
    "there is a good agreement between the number of @xmath13 mesons in the @xmath78 and @xmath67 samples  @xcite .",
    "this shows that the effects of the cuts are well understood and that the yield of the events coming from outside the target is about the same in the @xmath22he@xmath79 case as when the cuts are optimized for selecting a @xmath30he@xmath80 final state ( including @xmath80 production _ via _",

    "although the 1450  mev predictions are reasonably close to the data in the central region , the shape is quite different to that of the experiment , giving forward and backward dips rather than peaks .",
    "there are therefore disagreements of up to an order of magnitude at the extreme angles . on the other hand , at 1360  mev the two - step model predicts a fairly flat distribution with only a slight forward enhancement .",
    "however , it underestimates the cross section by a factor of about five in the forward region and by even more in the backward direction , which is a similar discrepancy to that reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the @xmath22he@xmath2 angular distribution is predicted to be anisotropic at 1360  mev even if only @xmath14-wave are retained for the @xmath124 vertex .",
    "this anisotropy persists in calculations carried out even closer to the threshold .",

    "since this theoretical approach underestimates the differential cross sections , it also underpredicts the total cross sections",
    ".    why does the two - step model fail for @xmath0 production ? if the intermediate pion is taken on - shell , as in the kilian and nann classical model  @xcite , the relative velocities of the deuteron from the @xmath109 and the proton from the @xmath125 subprocesses are very large at the extreme angles at 1450  mev . in contrast , at 1360  mev , the change in the velocity matching over the full angular region is much less .",
    "the cross sections calculated using the two - step model at 1360  mev thus describe the behavior of the experimental angular distribution but not its magnitude .",
    "the poor velocity matching implies that the intermediate pion is a long way off its mass shell for both beam energies , unlike the case of the @xmath22he@xmath68 reaction at threshold .",
    "the predictions might be improved by using off - shell @xmath123-matrices for both @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "however , it is clear that to reproduce the data at the extreme angles at 1450  mev requires contributions from other diagram(s ) since poor velocity matching is a kinematical effect that depends only upon the assumption of an intermediate pion .",
    "a similar conclusion might be drawn from the failure of the same model to describe well the @xmath22he@xmath68 angular distributions away from threshold  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section for the @xmath22he@xmath2 reaction has been measured over the full angular range at 1450  mev .",
    "the data show clear anisotropy , with strong rises in both the backward and forward directions . for",
    "the backward - going @xmath0 the agreement with spesiii data  @xcite is good , but the sharp forward peaking claimed at spesiii is not confirmed by our data .",
    "the two - step model fails to describe the angular distribution , giving a convex rather than the concave shape found in our data    the angular distribution at 1360  mev is consistent with isotropy and , within the experimental uncertainties , the differential cross section for the backward - going @xmath0 agrees with the spesiv point at @xmath128  @xcite . if the assumptions in refs .",
    "@xcite that the spesiv data are incorrectly interpreted are right , their point shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ang1360 ] would be higher and the agreement with our data would become worse .",
    "the large angular coverage of the wasa detector allowed values of the total cross sections at both energies to be extracted for the first time . at 1450",
    "mev we find @xmath99  nb , with an additional uncertainty from the normalization of 12% .",
    "the corresponding number at 1360  mev is @xmath129  nb , where the additional normalization uncertainty is 29% .",
    "the two - step model underestimates the total cross section data by a factor of about two at 1450  mev and by a factor of ten at 1360  mev .",
    "this is probably due to the velocity matching between the proton and deuteron produced in the two subprocesses being poor for some @xmath0 angles .",
    "further theoretical work is therefore needed to describe both @xmath0 and @xmath13 production in @xmath25 collisions .",
