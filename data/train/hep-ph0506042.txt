    "the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) remains the most pressing puzzle in elementary particle physics .",
    "experimentally , this question will be addressed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . theoretically , several interesting possibilities have been proposed . in this article , we will concentrate on the `` little higgs '' proposal  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the higgs emerges as a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson , whose properties are constrained by global symmetries .",
    "these global symmetries are not exact , and their breaking allows the higgs to participate in non - derivative ( i.e. gauge and yukawa ) interactions .",
    "at the same time , there is enough global symmetry left to ensure that the higgs mass term vanishes at tree level , and is only logarithmically sensitive to the unknown short distance ( ultraviolet , or uv ) physics at the one - loop level .",
    "the usual quadratic sensitivity of the higgs mass parameter on the uv physics first appears at two loops , and the incalculable uv effects remain subleading as long as the cutoff of the theory ( the scale at which it becomes strongly coupled ) is at or below about 10 tev . with this requirement ,",
    "the higgs mass terms are dominated by the one - loop contribution from the top loops , which has the appropriate sign to trigger the electroweak symmetry breaking , and produces the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the right order of magnitude .",
    "thus , little higgs theories provide an attractive explanation of ewsb .",
    "the originally proposed implementations of the little higgs approach suffered from severe constraints from precision electroweak measurements  @xcite , which could only be satisfied by finely tuning the model parameters .",
    "the most serious constraints resulted from the tree - level corrections to precision electroweak observables due to the exchanges of additional heavy gauge bosons present in the theories , as well as from the small but non - vanishing vev of an additional weak - triplet scalar field .",
    "motivated by these constraints , several new implementations of the little higgs were proposed  @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting is the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , which introduces a discrete symmetry , dubbed `` t parity '' in analogy to r parity in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "t parity explicitly forbids any tree - level contribution from the heavy gauge bosons to the observables involving only standard model ( sm ) particles as external states .",
    "it also forbids the interactions that induced the triplet vev . as a result , in t parity symmetric little higgs models , corrections to precision electroweak observables",
    "are generated exclusively at loop level .",
    "this implies that the constraints are generically weaker than in the tree - level case , and fine tuning can be avoided  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate the electroweak precision constraints on the models with t parity in more detail .",
    "we will concentrate on the t parity symmetric version of the littlest higgs ( lh ) model , based on an @xmath2 global symmetry breaking pattern  @xcite .",
    "some phenomenological aspects of this model have been analyzed in ref .",
    "the model possesses an attractive dark matter candidate , the t - odd partner of the hypercharge gauge boson , which has the correct relic abundance in certain regions of the parameter space .",
    "it also leads to an interesting set of signatures at the lhc ; in particular , an excess of events with large missing transverse energy is expected . in this paper",
    ", we will compute the corrections to the properties of @xmath3 bosons induced by the new particles present in the lh model , and perform a global fit to precision electroweak observables .",
    "we will show that a consistent fit can be obtained in a large region of the model parameter space , so that no significant fine tuning is required .",
    "we will also demonstrate that the lh model allows for consistent fits with values of the higgs mass as large as 800 gev , far in excess of the upper bound obtained within the standard model .",
    "finally , we will show that there exists a non - vanishing overlap between the region allowed by precision electroweak fits and the region where the lh model provides all of the observed dark matter .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after briefly reviewing the @xmath2 littlest higgs model with t parity in section  [ model ] , we will present the calculation of the corrections to precision electroweak observables in section  [ electroweak ] . in section",
