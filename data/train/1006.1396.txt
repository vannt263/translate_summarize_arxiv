    "for general microlensing events , the only lensing parameter that provides information about the physical parameters of the lens is the einstein time scale @xmath3 .",
    "however , the time scale results from the combination of the underlying physical lens parameters of the lens mass @xmath4 , relative lens - source parallax @xmath5 , and proper motion @xmath6 by @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 represents the angular einstein radius , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the distances to the lens and source star , respectively . as a result , it is difficult to uniquely determine the physical lens parameters from the time scale alone .    for complete determination of the physical parameters of a lens , it is required to measure both the lens parallax and angular einstein radius .",
    "the microlens parallax is defined by the ratio of the earth s orbit to the einstein radius projected on the observer plane , @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 in general , parallaxes are measured from the slight deviation of the overall shape of the light curve from a symmetric standard light curve @xcite , which is caused by the deviation of the relative lens - source motion from a rectilinear motion due to the orbital motion of the earth around the sun @xcite .",
    "parallaxes are usually measured for long time - scale events for which the parallax effect is maximized .",
    "einstein radii , on the other hand , are generally measured from the deviation of the light curve caused by the finite size of source stars such as caustic - approaching events @xcite . with the measured parallax and einstein radius , the mass of the lens and the distance to the lens",
    "are uniquely determined by @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the parallax of the source star .",
    "unfortunately , the conditions for the optimal measurements of the parallax and einstein radius are different and thus the chance to completely determine the physical parameters of lenses by measuring both quantities is low . in the literature , we find a total 13 microlensing events for which the lens masses were determined .",
    "these include eros-2000-blg-5 @xcite , sc26 - 2218 @xcite , ogle-2002-blg-018 @xcite , ogle-2003-blg-235 @xcite , ogle-2003-blg-238 @xcite , ogle-2006-blg-109 @xcite , ogle-2007-blg-050 @xcite , ogle-2007-blg-192 @xcite ogle-2007-blg-224 @xcite , ogle-2008-blg-279 @xcite , macho - lmc-5 @xcite , ogle-2003-blg-175/moa-2003-blg-045 @xcite , and ogle-2005-blg-071 @xcite .    in this paper , we report the result of the analysis of the microlensing event moa-2009-blg-016 .",
    "we determine the mass of the lens and distance to it by measuring both the einstein radius and lens parallax .",
    "we identify three distinct types of degeneracy , where two are previously known and the other is newly identified in this work .",
    "the microlensing event moa-2009-blg-016 occurred on a star located at @xmath17 , which corresponds to the galactic coordinates of @xmath18 .",
    "it was first detected by the moa collaboration on 2009 february 18 by using the 1.8 m telescope of mt .",
    "john observatory in new zealand .",
    "an anomaly was detected on april 2 and it was announced to the microlensing community . in response to the alert , the @xmath6fun team conducted follow - up observations by using the 1.3 m smarts telescope of ctio in chile .",
    "the ctio data are composed of 29 images in @xmath19 band and 5 images in @xmath20 band .",
    "data set from additional observatories were either single - epoch or near baseline and hence have not been included for analysis .",
    "photometric reductions of the data were carried out by using the codes developed by the individual groups .    in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present the light curve of the event .",
    "we note that the magnitude of the light curve is not calibrated .",
    "this is due to the lack of calibrated comparison stars in the field due to severe blending .",
    "however , the lensed star can be constrained from modeling combined with the color information obtained from the position of the source star on the color - magnitude diagram relative to the position of the center of clump giants in the field for which the de - reddened magnitude and color are well known .",
    "see more details in section 3.1 .",
    "we also note that data set from different observatories and filters are aligned by fitting them a common model .",
    "modeling microlensing light curves requires to include various parameters . to describe light curves of standard single - lens events , a set of three parameters are needed .",
    "these include the einstein time scale , @xmath3 , the time of the closest lens - source approach , @xmath21 , and the lens - source separation normalized by the einstein radius at the time of the closest approach , @xmath22 .",
    "if light curves exhibit binary - induced anomalies , an additional set of parameters is needed .",
    "these parameters include the mass ratio between the lens components , @xmath23 , the projected binary separation in units of the einstein radius , @xmath24 , and the angle of the source trajectory with respect to the binary axis , @xmath25 . for many cases of binary events , the normalized source radius , @xmath26 ,",
    "is needed to describe the lensing magnification whenever the angular radius of the source star , @xmath27 , plays an important role such as in the vicinity of a caustic crossing . for some long time - scale events with parallax - induced deviations , it is required to include the parallax parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which are the components of the lens - parallax vector @xmath30 projected on the sky in the north and east celestial coordinates , respectively .",
    "the direction of this vector is that of the lens - source relative motion in the frame of the earth at the peak of the event .",
    "similar to the deviation by the parallax effect , the source trajectory can also be affected by the orbital motion of the source if it is composed of binary stars ( ` xallarap ' effect ) . under the assumption of a circular orbit and a very faint binary companion",
    ", the xallarap effect is parameterized by the orbital period @xmath31 , inclination @xmath32 , and phase angle @xmath33 of the orbit .",
    "modeling light curves of microlensing events is a difficult task .",
    "the large number of parameters makes brute - force searches of solutions difficult .",
    "in addition , a simple downhill approach in the complicated @xmath34 surface often results in wrong solutions of local minima .",
    "we , therefore , use a hybrid approach where grid searches are conducted over the space of the parameters of @xmath24 , @xmath23 , and @xmath25 and the remaining parameters are searched by letting them vary so that they result in minimum @xmath34 at each grid of @xmath24 , @xmath23 , and @xmath25 parameters .",
    "we use a markov chain monte carlo method for @xmath34 minimization .",
    "once the @xmath34 minima of the individual grid points are determined , the best - fit model is obtained by comparing the @xmath34 values of the individual grids .",
    "we investigate degeneracy of the solutions by probing local minima that appear in the space of the grid parameters .",
    "the light curve of the event moa-2009-blg-016 is characterized by two important features .",
    "one is the anomaly near the peak of the light curve and the other is the asymmetry of the overall light curve . from modeling ,",
    "we find that the anomaly near the peak is well explained by the central perturbation caused by a close / wide binary . for the best - fit model ,",
    "the determined values of the projected separation and mass ratio between the binary components are @xmath35 we also find that the asymmetry of the light curve can be explained by the parallax effect .",
    "the determined values of the parallax parameters for the best - fit parallax model are @xmath36 the improvement of the fit with the addition of the parallax effect is @xmath37 .",
    "the parallax interpretation is consistent with the long time scale of the event , which is @xmath38 days for the best - fit model .",
    "it is known that a parallax signal can be mimicked by that of the xallarap effect @xcite . to check this possibility",
    ", we search for xallarap solutions under the assumption that the binary source is in a circular orbit .",
    "figure [ fig : two ] shows the distributions of @xmath39 as a function of the xallarap parameters obtained from modeling .",
    "we find that the best fit xallarap solution yields an improvement of @xmath40 for 3 additional degrees of freedom .",
    "although this improvement is formally highly significant and certainly implies that the 3 additional xallarap parameters are capable of `` responding '' to systematic deviations in the data that are not fully captured by the parallax modeling , we will now argue that the parallax solutions is preferred and the additional systematic deviations `` detected '' by the xallarap parameters are most likely due to other effects .",
    "the first point is that the parallax signal ( @xmath37 ) is more than 100 times stronger than the additional signal from xallarap , and such 1% systematic effects are quite common in microlensing events",
    ". these may be due to real effects , such as binary orbital motion , third bodies in the system , or other physical effects , or may simply be due to systematics in the data , which ( because of the fleeting nature of the events ) are taken under an extremely wide range of conditions .",
    "systematic effects at this level can never be definitively tracked down because the @xmath39 is too small to adequately characterize the real effects ( such as the mass and separation of a putative third body ) .",
    "second , if we consider the entire two - dimensional space of possible binary orientations , only 1/6 lie within @xmath41 of the minimum , i.e. , as close as the parallax solution ( see figure [ fig : two ] ) .",
    "if we further account for the fact that all events must have parallax at some level , whereas only half of sources have a binary companion of any mass , with period @xmath42 ( see [ fig : two ] ) , then the prior probability of a xallarap solution is only 1/12 .",
    "if there were known to be no other systematic effects ( real or instrumental ) affecting this event , then this 1/12 probability would have meager weight against a @xmath40 .",
    "but since such low - level systematics are in fact common , the 1/12 probability must be taken seriously . in brief , while we can not rule out the xallarap solution , we judge it to be relatively unlikely and so adopt the parallax solution .    we find that a finite - source model is preferred over a point - source model with @xmath43 .",
    "the amount of @xmath39 is not big , but we note that it is statistically significant considering that the signal of the finite - source effect lasts only a short period of time during the source s approach close to the cusp of the caustic .    in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present the best - fit model curve on the top of the light curve . also presented in the top panel is the model curve without the parallax effect .",
    "middle panel shows the residual from the best - fit model ( both the parallax and finite - source effect included ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the residuals from the best - fit finite - source ( red ) and point - source ( blue ) models in the region around the perturbation .",
    "we note that the data points in the bottom panel are binned by 4 hours to better show the difference .    in figure",

    ", we find that they result from three distinct types of degeneracy .",
    "the first type of degeneracy is the well - known close / wide degeneracy @xcite .",

    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : four ] , where one finds pairs of local minima with separations @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "the two light curves resulting from the two source trajectories are identical . if the parallax effect is not negligible , however , the light curves from the trajectories are slightly different due to the curvature of the source trajectory .",
    "the pairs of local minima with trajectory angles @xmath25 and @xmath57 in figure  [ fig : four ] are caused by this degeneracy .",
    "the third type of degeneracy is caused by the shape of the caustic .",
    "when the caustic is produced by a binary with a separation significantly larger or smaller than the einstein radius , its shape is a symmetric cycloid with four cusps where two cusps are on the binary axis and the others are off the axis .",
    "then , source trajectories approaching the caustic with angles @xmath25 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 result in a similar perturbation .",
    "we refer to this degeneracy as ` cycloid degeneracy ' .",
