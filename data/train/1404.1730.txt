    "in 1973 a breakthrough in financial modelling was proposed by black and scholes , who reinterpreted the langevin equation for brownian motion to predict value european options , assuming the underlying asset follows a stochastic process in the form@xcite @xmath1 for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the asset price , @xmath4 is the mean rate of the asset return and @xmath5 describes a wiener process , with distribution @xmath6 .",
    "the value of @xmath7 , so - called volatility , measures the risk associated to the fluctuation of the asset return .",
    "thus , by making a good estimate of its value one is able to establish a criterion for selling and buying in order to optimize the profit .",
    "the bs , and similar stochastic approaches based on gaussian uncorrelated noise sources , have since then received both strong criticism and improvements , such as stochastic volatility models@xcite .",
    "it has been acknowledged that in more realistic models the statistics of extreme events , leading to heavy tails in the distributions , as well as correlations between noise sources and other components need to be taken into account .    in this paper",
    "we put this important extension in a more general context . from a purely mathematical perspective , for each stochastic variable obeying a given langevin equation there is a probability density function ( pdf ) associated to it that fulfils a fokker - planck equation@xcite .",
    "probability density functions are defined by a few parameters that characterize the corresponding statistical moments .",
    "the generalization of the black - scholes model to incorporate stochastic volatility is a particular case of having one probability density function whose parameters are themselves stochastic variables governed by stochastic differential equations . by modelling such `` stochastic '' probability density functions",
    "one is able to properly describe how they evolve and , thus , evaluate how uncertain is a given prediction of the corresponding variable .",
    "we focus here on the evolution of the volume - price , i.e.  on changes in capitalization , which should have more the character of a conserved quantity than the price per se .",
    "while the price and volume distribution are useful for portfolio purposes , to have access to the overall distribution of volume - prices provides information about the entire capital traded in the market .    in this paper , we show that heavy tails are present in the statistics of the capitalization , and we specifically present a stochastic evolution equation for the tail parameter . in the context of finance models , such approach can eventually enable one to improve measures of risk and to provide additional insight in risk management .",

    "[ fig03]e and [ fig03]f as well as tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] , one sees that the best fit seems to be for the inverse gamma distribution and therefore we will consider henceforth only this distribution .",
    "to explore the inverse gamma distribution model , we first consider the meaning of its two parameters . a closer look at eq .",
    "( [ inverse_gamma - distribution_pdf ] ) leads to the conclusion that while @xmath14 characterizes the shape of the distribution for the lowest range of volume - prices , the parameter @xmath13 characterizes the power law tail @xmath31 .",

    "here @xmath35 is the bin including the average value @xmath36.,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    taking the time series of the parameter @xmath13 we derive the stochastic evolution equation as thoroughly described in ref .",
    "this approach retrieves two functions , called the drift and diffusion coefficients@xcite , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , governing the stochastic evolution of @xmath13 : @xmath39 where @xmath5 represents the typical wiener process , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "typically the drift term governs the deterministic contributions for the overall evolution of @xmath13 , while the diffusion term governs the corresponding ( stochastic ) fluctuations .",
    "functions @xmath42 and @xmath38 can be computed directly from the data@xcite computing the first and second conditional moments respectively ( @xmath43 ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents one specific bin - point in the range of observable values and the conditional moment is given by @xmath46    figure [ fig04]a and [ fig04]b show the first and second conditional moments respectively , as a function of @xmath47 , for a given bin value @xmath45 .",
    "for the lowest range of @xmath47 values one sees a linear dependence of the conditional moments , which enables to directly extract the corresponding value of the drift and diffusion in eq .",
    "( [ kramersmoyal ] ) .",
    "further , there is a clear offset in both moments , which indicates the presence of an additional stochastic process superimposed on the intrinsic stochastic dynamics , called measurement noise@xcite , whose amplitude can be estimated as @xmath48@xcite .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig04]b .     that describes the tail of the inverse-@xmath12 distribution ( see text).,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    by computing the slopes of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for each bin in variable @xmath13 yields a complete definition of both drift @xmath51 and diffusion @xmath52 coefficients for the full range of observed @xmath13 values .",
    "figures [ fig05]a and [ fig05]b show the drift and diffusion respectively . while the diffusion term has an almost constant amplitude , @xmath53 ,",
    "the drift is linear on @xmath13 with a negative sloped and a fixed point close to one , @xmath54 .",
    "this last observation is interesting from the point of view of the inverse gamma pdf : the volume - price tails fluctuate around an inverse square law @xmath55 driven by a restoring force which can be modelled through hooke s law .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuations around the inverse square law are quantified by the diffusion amplitude @xmath56 of the tail parameter , which can be interpreted as a sort of `` parameter volatility '' .",
    "in this paper we analyse new york stock market volume - price distributions during the last two years sampled every ten minutes . we tested four models commonly applied to finance data and presented evidence that the inverse gamma distribution is the model yielding the least error .",
    "further , we considered the parameter controlling the tail of the inverse gamma distribution and extracted a langevin equation governing its stochastic evolution directly from the parameter s time series . while the deterministic contribution ( drift ) depends linearly on the parameter , with a restoring force around unity approximately , the stochastic contribution ( diffusion ) is almost constant . considering both contributions together , our findings show that the tail of the volume - price distributions tend to evolve stochastically around an inverse square law with a constant parameter volatility .",
    "this parameter volatility can be proposed as a risk measure for the expected tail of new york assets .",
    "the analysis propose here can be extended to other markets or even in other contexts where non - stationary processes are observed .",
    "if the inverse gamma distribution is commonly the best model for volume - price distributions is up to our knowledge an open question .",
    "the confidence of each model can be further tested using other methods such as the kolmogorov - smirnov test@xcite .",
    "it must be noticed that the above approach is only valid for markovian processes , which seems to be the case of the parameter here considered , which was tested comparing two - point and three - point conditional probabilities .",
    "moreover , the langevin analysis here proposed can also be extended to both parameters characterizing the inverse gamma model .",
    "further research will be necessary to access the reliability of the stochastic reconstruction of the volume - price evolution , and a comparison to theoretical agent models .",
    "these and other issues will be addressed elsewhere .",
