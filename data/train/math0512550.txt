    "the _ voter model _ is an interacting particle system in which individuals ( particles ) of two species , _ red _ and _ blue _ , compete for `` territory '' on a ( locally finite ) graph . at each time",

    "thus , a vertex of color @xmath2 spontaneously flips to the opposite color @xmath4 at rate equal to the number of neighboring vertices of color @xmath4 .",
    "see @xcite for a formal construction of this process and an exposition of its basic properties .    the _ richardson model _",
    "@xcite was introduced as a model for the spatial spread of a population in a favorable environment .",
    "the environment is once again a locally finite graph . at any time a vertex may be occupied by _ at most _ one particle ( some vertices may be unoccupied ) ; all particles are of the same species .",
    "once occupied , a vertex remains occupied forever .",
    "each unoccupied vertex is spontaneously occupied at instantaneous rate equal to the number of occupied neighbors .    in this paper",
    "we study a hybrid of the voter and richardson models on the integer lattice @xmath5 , which we dub the _ two - species competition model _ , or simply the _ competition model_. the dynamics are as in the voter model , but unlike the voter model , vertices may be unoccupied .",
    "an unoccupied vertex is colonized at rate equal to the number of occupied neighbors , as in the richardson model ; at the instant of first colonization , the vertex flips to the color of a randomly chosen occupied neighbor .",
    "once occupied , a vertex remains occupied forever , but its color may flip , as in the voter model : the flip rate is equal to the number of neighbors occupied by particles of the opposite color .",
    "the state of the system at any time @xmath6 is given by the pair @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the set of sites occupied by red and blue particles , respectively .",
    "note that the set @xmath10 of occupied sites evolves precisely as in the richardson model , and so the growth of this set is governed by the same _ shape theorem _",
    "( see section [ sec : richardson ] below ) as is the richardson model .",
    "our primary interest is in the possibility of long - term coexistence of the two species , given initial conditions in which only finitely many vertices are occupied ( with at least one vertex of each color ) .",
    "it is clear that at least one of the two species must survive , and that for any nondegenerate finite initial configuration of colors there is positive probability that red survives and positive probability that blue survives .",
    "however , it is not at all obvious ( except perhaps in the case where the ambient graph on which the competition takes place is the integer lattice @xmath11  see section [ sec:1d ] below ) that the event of mutual survival has positive probability .",
    "our main result concerns the competition model on the graph @xmath5 .",

    "[ newman : theorem1 ] if the limit shape @xmath12 for the richardson model is uniformly curved , then for any nondegenerate initial finite configuration the event of mutual survival of the two species has positive probability .",

    "theorem [ newman : theorem1 ] is by no means a complete solution to the coexistence problem , because it remains unknown whether the limit shape @xmath12 for the richardson model is uniformly curved , or even if its boundary @xmath18 is strictly convex .",
    "nevertheless , simulations give every indication that it is , and @xcite suggests a possible explanation of what lies behind the strict convexity of @xmath18 .",
    "the two - species complete model is superficially similar to the _ two - type richardson model",
    "_ studied by haggstrom and pemantle @xcite , but differs in that it allows displacement of colors on occupied sites : in the two - type richardson model , once a vertex is occupied by a particle ( either red or blue ) it remains occupied by that color forever .",
    "the main result of @xcite is similar to theorem [ newman : theorem1 ] , but requires no hypothesis about the richardson shape : it states that mutual unbounded growth has positive probability .",
    "because no displacements are allowed , the behavior of the two - type richardson model is very closely tied up with the first - passage percolation process with exponential edge passage times .",
    "the two - species competition model is also closely related to first - passage percolation , but the connection is less direct , because the possibility of displacements implies that not only the first passages across edges play a role in the evolution .",
    "we have run simulations of the competition model with initial configuration @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "figure [ 800competition ] shows two snap shots of the same realization of the process taken at the times when the region occupied by both types , @xmath21 , hits the boundary of the rectangles @xmath22 \\times [ -300,\\ 300]$ ] and @xmath23 \\times [ -400,\\ 400]$ ] respectively .",

    "the sizes and directions of these angular sectors ( and even their number ) will , we expect , be random , with distributions depending on the initial configuration .",
    "this is illustrated by simulation results summarized in figure [ mixedcompetition ] with initial configuration @xmath34 three time progressive snap shots of the process were taken .",

    "consequently , there is positive probability that @xmath40 never exits the interval @xmath45 .",
    "but on this event , both species survive .",

    "therefore , the intersection @xmath291 is an angular sector with nonempty interior .    finally , for each @xmath277 define @xmath292 to be the event that at time @xmath293 there are no blue sites in @xmath294 outside the ( richardson norm ) disk of radius @xmath295 .",
    "( for @xmath296 , set @xmath297 . ) on the event @xmath298 , the set of all occupied sites is close to @xmath299 , and the red sites fill at least the outer layer of this set in the sector @xmath294 .",
    "we claim that for all sufficiently large @xmath149 , @xmath300 to see this , let @xmath301 be the smallest index @xmath194 such that @xmath302 occurs . since @xmath303 can only occur on @xmath304 , @xmath305 inequality ( [ eq : ldsum ] ) provides a bound on the sum of the first of these terms , and lemma [ lemma : stabilization ] bounds the second .",
    "thus , for @xmath149 sufficiently large , @xmath306 this proves ( [ eq : final ] ) .    on the event @xmath298",
    ", the red species must at time @xmath293 occupy at least the outer layer of the occupied set in the angular sector @xmath307 . consequently , on the event @xmath308 , red survives ! this proves ( [ newman : equationinitialconfigurationred ] ) .",
    "the preceding argument , in addition to proving that the event that mutual survival has positive probability , also goes part of the way towards proving conjecture [ conj ] : if at a large time @xmath149 one of the colors ( say red ) occupies the outer layer of an angular sector , then with conditional probability approaching @xmath42 as @xmath309 it will occupy a slightly smaller angular sector forever after . since the same is true for the other species , it follows that in at least some evolutions red and blue will each occupy angular sectors .    unfortunately , it remains unclear what happens near the interface at large times .",
    "although the preceding arguments show that neither red nor blue can make too deep an incursion into the other species sector(s ) , it may be possible for one to repeatedly make small incursions across the interface that engender more ( and necessarily thinner ) angular sectors in its zone of occupation .",
    "thus , it may be that the limit shapes exist , but consist of countably many angular sectors .",
    "finally , it remains unclear if stabilization must eventually occur on the event of mutual survival , that is , if it is necessarily the case that at large times @xmath149 the outer layer of the occupied region must segregate into well - defined red and blue zones .",
    "since local coalescence occurs in the voter model , one naturally expects that the same will be true in the competition model ; thus far , we have been unable to prove this ."
