    "one of the objectives of contemporary studies of @xmath8 meson decays is to check whether their description provided by the standard model ( sm ) is correct .",
    "should the values of the sm parameters , extracted in various ways , turned out to be inconsistent , we might conclude that some kind of new physics is needed .",
    "since new physics is expected to enter through loop diagrams , it should appear in penguin amplitudes .",
    "at the same time one has to keep in mind that diagrams of penguin topology can be also generated by ordinary final state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "thus , it is important that all effects of fsi are subtracted before any claim as to the presence of new physics is made .",
    "however , controlling rescattering effects in b decays is non - trivial as fsi may be highly inelastic @xcite .",
    "indeed , it follows from our knowledge of high energy scattering that when two pseudoscalar mesons @xmath9 collide at @xmath8-meson energy , a many - body state is generally produced .",
    "therefore , in @xmath4 decays one may expect contributions not only from the standard @xmath10 quark - level transitions ( corrected for the elastic @xmath11 , and quasi - elastic @xmath12 transitions ) , but also from the inelastic @xmath13 processes with many mesons in the intermediate state .",
    "taking into account all of the latter fsi effects is possible only if substantial simplifications in their description are made .",
    "since contributions from inelastic fsi are incalculable , the only feasible way to consider them is to express somehow their effects in terms of a small number of effective parameters .",
    "the issue of how to do that was addressed in @xcite , where several essential simplifications , listed below , were made .",
    "first , it was assumed that the fsi effects lead to an only small correction to the standard description in terms of short - distance ( sd ) amplitudes .",
    "the fsi - corrected amplitudes @xmath14 ( a set of all relevant amplitudes @xmath15 ) could therefore be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes all @xmath15 sd amplitudes and @xmath18 is the rescattering matrix .",
    "second , it was assumed that fsi is @xmath19 symmetric ( with @xmath19 breaking considered later ) . in this way , rescattering effects in all @xmath20 decays are related .",
    "third , an essential simplification was made in the treatment of many - body intermediate states which may occur in @xmath10 transitions . as the original weak decay leads initially to @xmath21 or @xmath22 states which evolve into",
    "many - body states only later , e.g. : @xmath23 it is natural to include the second transition above ( @xmath24 ) into the definition of fsi .",
    "thus , as the intermediate states only two - body states @xmath25 may be taken ( the @xmath21 state may also be considered as decaying to @xmath26 through the @xmath25 stage ) .",
    "fourth , a way to sum over all intermediate @xmath27 states was proposed ( hereafter we suppress the primes in @xmath25 ) .",
    "consider e.g. a tree amplitude @xmath28 for the production of a general two - body intermediate state @xmath27 . without loosing generality one can always write : @xmath29 i.e. express the amplitude @xmath28 in terms of the sd tree amplitude @xmath30 .",
    "similarly one can always write for the penguin amplitude : @xmath31 with analogous expressions for other diagram types .",
    "since fsi effects constitute a correction , only the dominant sd amplitudes ( i.e. @xmath32,@xmath1 and the color - suppressed @xmath33 amplitude in @xmath34 decays ) need to be taken into account .",
    "the essential simplification consists here in assuming that : @xmath35 the above assumption helps in reducing the number of effective fsi parameters .",
    "further drastic reduction in their number is achieved via the summation over all intermediate states @xmath27 .",
    "consider for example the contribution from tree amplitudes @xmath28 with a part of fsi in which no flavor quantum numbers are exchanged in the @xmath36-channel of the rescattering amplitude ( pomeron exchange ) . denoting the @xmath37 amplitude by @xmath38 one",
    "can then write @xmath39 where @xmath40 was introduced as an effective parameter .",
    "if the part of fsi with the topology of e.g. fig.1(u ) is taken into account one similarly obtains : @xmath41 with appropriately defined @xmath42 , i.e. an effective penguin diagram is created ( fig .",
    "1(p ) ) .",
    "fifth , zweig rule was assumed .",
    "this means that only two types of ( flavor transfer ) fsi diagrams are possible as shown in fig.1(u ) ( uncrossed ) , and fig.1(c ) ( crossed ) .",
    "for fsi of the uncrossed type two @xmath19 forms are possible : @xmath43\\{p_1,p_2\\})u_-(m_1m_2),&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 are parameters describing the strength of the relevant transitions .",
    "bose symmetry requires that the final @xmath9 state is described by a symmetric form @xmath45 .",
    "charge conjugation invariance of strong interactions requires that the product of @xmath33-parities of mesons meson multiplets are defined to be the c - parities of their neutral members ] @xmath27 is positive for ( [ uplus ] ) and negative for ( [ uminus ] ) , respectively : @xmath46 for the fsi of the crossed type only one @xmath19 form , symmetric under @xmath47 , can be written : @xmath48 as it was shown in @xcite , when summation over @xmath27 is performed all inelastic fsi effects are ultimately reduced to the appearance of _ three _ effective fsi parameters ( analogues of @xmath49 ) only : @xmath50 ( @xmath51 involves now sums of terms including @xmath52 , etc . ) .",
    "if only @xmath53 intermediate states are admitted , it follows that @xmath54 and only two parameters remain .",
    "when the sums over all types of @xmath55 states and over all types of @xmath56 $ ] states are performed , one obtains expressions for the fsi - corrected @xmath4 amplitudes @xmath57 . for @xmath19-symmetric",
    "fsi the obtained expressions are identical in form to the sd expressions , but with redefined amplitudes @xcite .",
    "specifically , taking selected @xmath34 amplitudes as an example , one obtains : @xmath58 where @xmath59 analogous formulas hold for @xmath60 amplitudes @xmath61 , @xmath62 , etc .",
    "when explicit weak phases ( with @xmath63 , @xmath64 being the ckm matrix ) are introduced through @xmath65 , and the top - dominated penguin @xmath66 is assumed , one finds that the redefined penguin @xmath67 is of the form @xmath68 i.e. the `` top '' penguin gets rescaled , and an `` up '' penguin appears .",
    "rescattering induces also the appearance of annihilation ( @xmath69 ) , exchange ( @xmath70 ) , and penguin annihilation ( @xmath71 ) , all proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "in particular , note that the amplitude for the @xmath73 decay is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "thus the branching ratio for this decay does not yield any information on the remaining two fsi parameters ( @xmath74 ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one should think of @xmath75 as originating from one superposition of contributions from intermediate @xmath76 and @xmath77 states , with @xmath78 being due to the other superposition .",
    "thus , the two contribution may cancel in @xmath72 , while adding in @xmath79 .",
    "only if we knew that pseudoscalar mesons alone contribute in the intermediate states , would the measured size of @xmath73 indeed tell us about the size of the `` up '' penguin @xmath80 .",
    "the third fsi parameter , @xmath81 , redefines the tree and color - suppressed diagrams according to the formula : @xmath82 which shows that an originally small size of @xmath83 could be substantially affected by fsi of the crossed type .",
    "since in the real world @xmath19 is broken , for the purpose of fitting the data on @xmath84 decays it is appropriate to break @xmath19 both in the elastic , as well as in the quasi - elastic and inelastic contributions .",
    "treatment of su(3 ) breaking in elastic fsi is straightforward : from total cross - section data on @xmath85 , @xmath86 , etc .",
    "one can extract the relevant @xmath19-breaking couplings of pomeron to mesons .",
    "thus , elastic @xmath19-breaking fsi effects in @xmath87 are fully calculable ( see @xcite ) .    for the inelastic ( and quasi - elastic ) @xmath88 transitions",
    "one expects the annihilation ( or exchange ) of strange ( anti)quarks to be suppressed when compared to analogous amplitudes with all quarks non - strange .",
    "data on hadron - hadron collisions at @xmath8-mass energy indicate that the relevant suppression factor @xmath89 is much smaller than its @xmath19-suggested value of @xmath90 . setting @xmath91 invalidates the use of @xmath19 formulas .",
    "in fact , for the @xmath19 breaking case the general fsi formulas do not permit quark diagrams to be redefined in a way analogous to eqs.([patilde ] ) and valid simultaneously for all amplitudes .",
    "instead , one has to use the full form of relevant @xmath19-breaking expressions given in @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that an estimate of the size of rescattering may be obtained from a comparison of the branching ratios of @xmath92-spin - related decays @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite . in a world with @xmath19-symmetric fsi this could be done since in these two decays the @xmath95-quark penguins generated from tree diagrams according to fig.1(p ) are of different relative magnitudes when compared with the dominant @xmath36-quark penguins .",
    "indeed , using @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( @xmath98 being the wolfenstein parameter ) one finds that in @xmath99 the ratio of the tree - generated penguin to the original penguin is @xmath100 , while for the @xmath94 decay the relevant ratio is simply @xmath101 . with @xmath102 , the fsi effects should be much more pronounced in @xmath93 .",
    "however , when @xmath19 breaking in fsi is taken into account the fsi effects in @xmath93 become suppressed by a factor of @xmath89 ( with the creation of a new @xmath103 pair being unlikely ) , and the overall difference between the size of rescattering effects in the two modes becomes proportional to @xmath104 , which may be much closer to @xmath90 than @xmath105 .",
    "in the actually performed fits to the @xmath4 branching ratios the following sixteen channels were considered : 3 @xmath106 channels , 4 @xmath107 , 3 @xmath108 , 2 @xmath109 , 2@xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "the fits consisted in minimizing the @xmath113 function involving theoretical and experimental branching ratios @xmath114 and their experimental errors @xmath115 : @xmath116    four sd parameters were used : @xmath117 , @xmath118 , the singlet penguin @xmath119 , and @xmath2 .",
    "the remaining amplitudes were related by @xmath120 , and @xmath121 ( with @xmath122 ) , and by @xmath123 , @xmath124 , with @xmath125 and including the dominant electroweak penguin with @xmath126 .",
    "prior to the inclusion of fsi , all amplitudes were assumed to have weak phases only .",
    "fits performed for the case of su(3)-breaking pure elastic fsi showed the latter to be negligible , and led to @xmath127 around @xmath128 ( as in the case with no fsi at all ) . in all fits involving free inelastic fsi parameters ( in addition to @xmath129 , etc . ) , the value of @xmath72 was set to @xmath130 , and maximal su(3 ) breaking was assumed ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "then , two simplified cases were studied first : 1 ) with vanishing @xmath81 and free complex @xmath79 , and 2 ) with vanishing @xmath79 and real @xmath132 ( this restriction takes care of direct - channel no - exotics condition for the crossed - type diagrams . ) results of the fits are shown in fig.2 .",
    "one can see that substantial shifts in the fitted value of @xmath127 , away from the no - fsi value of around @xmath128 , are obtained .",
    "free , @xmath133 ; 2 ) solid line - @xmath134 , @xmath81 free .",
    ", width=259 ]    in a general fit performed with both @xmath79 and @xmath81 free , a very shallow global minimum was found close to the one obtained in case 1 ) above .",
    "thus , the general fit permits values of @xmath2 in a broad range , including its standard model value @xmath135 ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "one might question whether fsi can indeed shift the value of @xmath2 that much .",
    "however , shifts of similar size are obtained also when performing fits for charming penguins only , i.e. without inelastic rescattering involving intermediate states composed of light quarks .",
    "namely , in @xcite it was shown that one should expect the charming penguin contribution @xmath136 to be comparable with @xmath137 : @xmath138 results of the fits ( shown in fig.3 ) performed with @xmath139 and @xmath140 for an updated set of branching ratios indicate @xcite that for the charmed penguin of size expected in ( @xcite ) , the shift in @xmath2 may well be of the order of @xmath141 degrees .     for short - dashed , long - dashed , solid , and dotted lines respectively , width=259 ]",
    "in standard short - distance approaches with built - in @xmath19-symmetry the amplitudes for b - meson weak decays may be decomposed into several quark diagram amplitudes . when @xmath19-symmetric final state interactions are taken into account",
    ", the resulting fsi - corrected amplitudes must also be decompasable into several _ effective _ quark diagram amplitudes . in this",
    "talk the connection between the two sets of quark diagram amplitudes was presented for the appropriately simplified but still general case of inelastic fsi .",
    "thus , an understanding of how fsi redefine original quark diagram amplitudes was reached .",
    "in particular it was shown that all leading effects of @xmath19-symmetric fsi may be parametrized by only three effective parameters .",
    "experimental upper bound on the @xmath3 branching ratio limits the size of one of these parameters only .",
    "the remaining two parameters redefine the penguin amplitude and mix the tree and color - suppressed amplitudes .    from the fits to sixteen branching ratios of @xmath4",
    "decays performed with no fsi taken into account it follows that such fits are still quite sensitive to the uncertainties present in the experimental data ( with the fitted value of @xmath2 changing from around @xmath128 to @xmath142 ) .",
    "the fits performed with maximal @xmath19 breaking in inelastic fsi ( not including charmed intermediate states ) admit a strong shift in the extracted value of @xmath2 ( within the range of @xmath143 ) , favoring the sm value of @xmath127 very weakly .",
    "similar shifts and conclusions are obtained from the fits when only charming penguins are considered .",
