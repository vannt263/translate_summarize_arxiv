    "entanglement is the distinct feature that makes quantum mechanics fundamentally different from a classical statistical theory . undeniably playing a pivotal role in quantum information theory , in notions of key distribution , quantum computing and simulation",
    ", it is increasingly becoming clear that notions of entanglement have the potential to add a fresh perspective to the study of systems of condensed matter physics .",
    "notions of entanglement entropies and spectra are increasingly used to capture properties of quantum systems with many degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the entanglement entropy based on the von - neumann entropy plays here presumably the most important role @xcite .",
    "however , it makes sense as an entanglement measure only for pure states .",
    "hence , early on , computable measures of entanglement such as the entanglement negativity @xcite have been considered in the context of the study of quantum many - body systems .",
    "in fact , one of the earliest studies on entanglement properties of ground states of local hamiltonians considered this entanglement measure @xcite , which was followed by a series of works on harmonic lattices @xcite .",
    "recent years have seen a revival of interest in studies of entanglement negativity , and the problem has been attacked using a number of different approaches .",
    "numerical studies were performed for various spin chains via tensor network calculations @xcite , monte carlo simulations where the replica trick comes into play @xcite or via numerical linked cluster expansion @xcite . on the analytical side ,",
    "major developments include the conformal field theory ( cft ) approach @xcite which has also been extended to finite temperature @xcite , non - equilibrium @xcite and off - critical @xcite scenarios .",
    "for some particular spin chains , there are even exact results available @xcite . studies of negativity have also been carried out for two - dimensional lattices @xcite with a particular emphasis on topologically ordered phases @xcite    the entanglement negativity ",
    "first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , elaborated upon in ref .",
    "@xcite , and proven to be an entanglement monotone in refs .",
    "@xcite  can be computed efficiently in the hilbert space dimension for spin systems . for gaussian bosonic systems , as they occur as ground and thermal states of non - interacting models , the negativity can even be efficiently computed in the number of modes @xcite . this is possible because the partial transpose @xcite on which the entanglement negativity is based , reflects partial time reversal @xcite , which maps bosonic gaussian states to gaussian operators .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the situation for fermionic gaussian systems , where the partial transpose is , in general , no longer a fermionic gaussian operator @xcite .",
    "consequently , there is still no efficiently calculable formula known for the negativity .",
    "this is unfortunate , since gaussian ( or free ) fermionic systems are specifically rich .",
    "for example , some well - known models showing features of _ topological _ properties such as kitaev s honeycomb lattice model are non - interacting @xcite .",
    "also one of the most paradigmatic one - dimensional models exhibiting edge states in a topologically non - trivial phase , the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model @xcite is a non - interacting ( or quasi - free ) fermionic system .",
    "the lack of a formula for negativity of fermionic gaussian states has stimulated a concerted research activity on identifying good bounds @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we make a fresh attempt at proving tight bounds to the entanglement negativity .",
    "each bound considered here depend exclusively on the covariance matrix of the gaussian state at hand , and thus is efficiently computable in the number of modes . in particular",
    ", the lower bound makes use of a pinching transformation of the covariance matrix , while the first of two upper bounds requires techniques of semi - definite programming .",
    "the second upper bound was already proposed in a cft context @xcite , which is now elaborated and closed form expressions for arbitrary fermionic gaussian states are given .",
    "we also test our bounds by estimating the negativity between adjacent segments in the ssh model and the xx chain , both in the ground state and at finite temperatures .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : prelim ] we introduce the notation used in the rest of this work and define the negativity , followed by some basic examples given in section [ sec : basic ] .",
    "the lower bound is constructed in section [ sec : lb ] , whereas section [ sec : ub1 ] and [ sec : ub2 ] deal with two different upper bounds , based on semi - definite programming and products of gaussian operators , respectively .",
    "numerical checks of the bounds are presented in section [ sec : num ] , followed by our concluding remarks in section [ sec : outlook ] .",
    "throughout this work , we consider quantum systems consisting of a set of fermionic modes ; the annihilation and creation operators @xmath0 associated with the modes generates the car algebra , i.e. , the algebra of operators respecting the canonical anti - commutation relations . in many context",
    "it is convenient to refer rather to majorana fermions than to the original ones , by defining @xmath1 for @xmath2 . given a state @xmath3 , the second moments of the majorana fermions can be collected in the covariance matrix @xmath4 , with entries @xmath5).\\ ] ] it is easy to see that this matrix satisfies @xmath6 we will denote the set of such covariance matrices of @xmath7 modes as @xmath8 .",

    "let us comment about the spectral properties of @xmath199 . by a similarity transformation one can permute the factors in the second term of to arrive at @xmath213 where @xmath214 denotes equivalence of the spectra .",
    "furthermore , using the definition in eq .  , one can write @xmath215 where @xmath216 thus the second term in becomes block diagonal @xmath217 with the sign of the reduced covariance matrix of the @xmath32 modes being reversed .",
    "in particular , if the state on @xmath218 is pure , i.e. @xmath60 , then the spectrum of @xmath199 is simply given by the eigenvalues of @xmath219 and @xmath220 , respectively . moreover , since the spectrum of @xmath219 and @xmath221 are identical ( up to trivial eigenvalues @xmath222 if @xmath223 ) this just leads to a double degeneracy .",
    "for the upper bound of the logarithmic negativity , it is useful to define the quantity @xmath224 such that @xmath225",

    "the upper bound is tight without the additional constant @xmath232 , since the operators @xmath191 and @xmath192 commute .",
    "in this section we will test the covariance - matrix based bounds introduced before on the concrete example of a dimerized xx chain . after jordan - wigner transformation , this is equivalent to a non - interacting fermionic chain with an alternating hopping @xmath233 , given by the hamiltonian @xmath234 with dimerization parameter @xmath235 .",
    "this is also called the ssh chain . in all our examples we consider an open chain with even sites @xmath236 at half filling , and calculate the entanglement between the modes of two adjacent intervals , such that the spin- and fermion - chain negativity are indeed equivalent .",
    "a further simplification occurs due to the fact , that the hamiltonian is particle - number conserving . on one hand",
    ", this allows us to implement our simple construction for the lower bound . on the other hand",
    ", it makes the calculations for the upper bound easier , since all the information is encoded in the fermionic correlation matrix elements @xmath237 .",
    "as already noted in @xcite , for a particle - conserving gaussian state with real @xmath98 one can replace the covariance matrix @xmath238 and define the matrices @xmath239 and @xmath240 correspondingly .",
    "the formulas leading to the upper bound are then completely analogous to and , except that the @xmath207 symbols have to be replaced by ordinary determinants .",
    "first , we test both lower and upper bounds against exact calculations of the logarithmic negativity for small chain sizes @xmath241 . for simplicity ,",
    "we consider two adjacent intervals of the same size @xmath242 , taken symmetrically from the center of the chain .",
    "we will consider both ground and thermal states of the dimerized chain , for which the fermionic correlation matrix elements read @xmath243 where @xmath244 and @xmath245 are the single - particle eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian .    before presenting our data ,",
    "let us comment on an observation about the upper bound .",
    "although the inequality reads @xmath225 , in all our numerics we observe that the bound is actually tighter , i.e. one has @xmath246 .",
    "this has also been conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite but a rigorous proof is lacking .    in our first example",
    "we consider the ground state of a chain with @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "the data is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : lnbgs ] as a function of the dimerization parameter @xmath249 .",
    "note that , since @xmath250 is even , the hopping between the two subsystems is given by @xmath251 .",
    "thus the entanglement vanishes for @xmath252 while it is given by @xmath253 at the other extreme @xmath254 , where a singlet is formed in the center .",
    "as expected from its construction , the lower bound @xmath255 performs well only in the region @xmath256 , where one has a singlet - type dominant contribution to the entanglement .",
    "remarkably , the upper bound @xmath226 gives an overall good performance on both sides , with an almost perfect saturation for @xmath257 .",
    "however , approaching @xmath258 , the entanglement tends to stay closer to its lower bound .    , with @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "]    it is very instructive to have a look also at the thermal case .",
    "here we consider the two halves of a chain with @xmath247 sites as subsystems and vary the temperature .",
    "this scenario exhibits a very rich physics , as depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : lnbth ] , where now the symbols show the exact data , whereas the solid lines with matching colors give the respective bounds .",
    "in fact , in the regime @xmath256 where the couplings at the boundaries are weak , the hamiltonian supports edge states .",
    "consequently , the ground state shows topological features which yields an additional @xmath253 contribution to the entanglement as @xmath258 .",
    "since the state is pure , one has @xmath259 , as discussed earlier .",
    "however , already a slight increase of the temperature ( see @xmath260 ) seems to destroy this order , hence the topological contribution to the entanglement vanishes .",
    "not surprisingly , for these low temperatures the upper bound gives a very good overall estimation .",
    "nevertheless , for increasing temperatures , the data gradually moves towards the lower bound .",
    "this improved performance can be understood by a simple argument .",
    "the construction of the lower bound erases all the correlations within each subsystem @xmath31 and @xmath32 . at higher temperatures , however , such correlations are already washed out and thus the approximation is more valid .    , and for various values of @xmath261 .",
    "the symbols represent the exact data , while the solid lines with matching colors show the corresponding bounds . ]      from now on we focus on the homogeneous chain @xmath262 , and take the thermodynamic limit @xmath263 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then diagonalized by a fourier transform and the correlation matrix takes the simple form @xmath264 our main goal is to study the scaling of the upper bound as a function of the inverse temperature @xmath261 and subsystem sizes @xmath265 and @xmath266 and compare it to the predictions of cft @xcite .",
    "we start with the study of @xmath226 in the ground state and take @xmath267 for simplicity . invoking eq .",
    ", one observes that the upper bound can be written as the difference of two rnyi entropies , with respect to gaussian states @xmath268 and @xmath204 .",
    "note that , while the former is just the reduced density operator of an interval of size @xmath269 in an infinite hopping chain , the latter one has no particular physical interpretation .    to understand the scaling behaviour of the entropies , it is useful to have a look at the corresponding free - fermion entanglement hamiltonians @xmath270 and @xmath271 , defined by @xcite @xmath272 their single - particle spectra , @xmath273 and @xmath274 , respectively , are related via @xmath275 to the spectra @xmath276 of @xmath277 and @xmath278 of @xmath240 .",
    "owing to the simple thermal form of the density operators , the calculation of renyi entropies reduces to evaluating entropy formulas for a fermi gas .",
    "in fact , the leading contributions to the entropies are delivered by the low - lying eigenvalues of the spectra . for the entanglement hamiltonian @xmath270 ,",
    "these were studied before and , for @xmath279 , are given approximately by @xcite @xmath280 with the digamma function @xmath281 .",
    "thus the entanglement hamiltonian has a level spacing inversely proportional to @xmath282 , or in other words , a logarithmic density of states . in turn",
    ", this yields the celebrated result for the renyi entropies @xmath283 we shall now have a look at the spectra @xmath274 and their behaviour as a function of @xmath242 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exl ] .",
    "apart from the double degeneracy of the eigenvalues , the spectra show very similar features to those of @xmath273 .",
    "in particular , one can observe the slow logarithmic variation of the spacing and the approximate linear behaviour around zero .",
    "we thus propose the ansatz @xmath284 with fitting parameters @xmath285 and @xmath286 . fitting the lowest - lying eigenvalue as a function of @xmath242",
    ", we obtain @xmath287 and @xmath288 where , for better fit results , we also included a subleading term proportional to @xmath289 .",
    "note that the higher part of the spectrum shows a slight upward bend which is again very similar to the behaviour of the @xmath273 spectra @xcite .     for various @xmath242 .",
    "]    from the ansatz in eq .",
    "it is very easy to infer the leading scaling behaviour of the renyi entropies .",
    "indeed , the main difference from is the increased level spacing , leading to a decrease of the density of states by a factor of @xmath290 . taking into account also the double degeneracy of the spectrum ,",
    "one arrives at @xmath291 that is , ignoring the subleading constant which is also modified due to the parameter @xmath286 , the entropies @xmath292 and @xmath293 differ by a factor of @xmath294 .",
    "this is indeed the result we find numerically by fitting the data for various @xmath295 .",
    "finally , inserting the appropriate renyi entropies into , one immediately finds @xmath296 thus , the upper bound shows exactly the same scaling as the logarithmic negativity predicted by cft calculations with central charge @xmath297 @xcite .     for @xmath298 and various @xmath299 .",
    "]    it is instructive to have a look also at the case of unequal adjacent segments of size @xmath299 and @xmath300 , where the cft prediction gives @xcite @xmath301 the corresponding spectra @xmath274 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exl1l2 ] , for a fixed overall length @xmath298 and varying @xmath299 .",
    "the main feature to be seen is the breaking of the degeneracies .",
    "indeed , from the analog of eq .   to the present case",
    ", it is clear that the spectrum of @xmath240 must somehow mix those of @xmath302 , @xmath303 and @xmath277 , which is reflected on the corresponding single - particle entanglement spectra .",
    "unfortunately , however , it is very difficult to separate the various contributions and , in contrast to the case of a single length scale in , we have not been able to find a simple ansatz .",
    "nevertheless , from evaluating @xmath226 , we find exactly the same scaling behaviour as obtained from cft .",
    "the results are plotted against the proper scaling variable on fig .",
    "[ fig : lnubl1l2 ] , finding a perfect collapse of the data . furthermore , comparing to the result for equal intervals as a function of the segment size , we observe that the two functions match perfectly .",

    ", the solid line shows the equal - segment result , with @xmath267 . ]      as our final exmaple , we consider thermal states of the infinite hopping chain with adjacent equal - size segments , where the cft calculation of the logarithmic negativity gives @xcite @xmath304 hence , for any finite temperatures and @xmath305 , the negativity satifies an area law . to compare it to the behaviour of the upper bound",
    ", one should first have a look at the corresponding spectra @xmath274 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : exth ] as a function of @xmath242 and for various @xmath261 .",
    "one sees the thermal flattening of the spectra with increasing temperatures , which signals a crossover from logarithmic to linear density of states in @xmath242 .     and various @xmath261 . ]    as an immediate consequence , the renyi entropy @xmath306 becomes extensive .",
    "this , however , does not necessarily spoil the tightness of our upper bound , since the contribution from @xmath307 , which is itself extensive , has to be subtracted .",
    "indeed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnubth ] , we find numerically that @xmath226 saturates for large @xmath242 for any nonzero temperatures and hence the extensive contributions from the two entropies exactly cancel .",
    "moreover , as shown on the inset , we confirm that @xmath226 has exactly the same scaling behaviour as @xmath308 in .",
    "note , however , that it is difficult to find an analytic argument to understand this type of scaling on the level of the spectra @xmath274 , since one has to look for subleading effects .     against @xmath242 .",
    "the inset shows the data against cft scaling variable . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have presented rigorous bounds to the entanglement negativity that are efficiently computable for fermionic gaussian states . in particular , the definition of the lower bound and one of the upper bounds is a simple function of the covariance matrices , allowing an efficient calculation in the number of fermionic modes .",
    "furthermore , we have also constructed an upper bound which makes use of semi - definite programming techniques .",
    "there are a number of questions left open for future research .",
    "first , in all our numerical examples , carried out for adjacent intervals in a dimerized hopping chain , we observed that the upper bound of the logarithmic negativity can actually be made more tight by neglecting an additive constant @xmath309 .",
    "although it has also been conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite , we could not give a rigorous proof in support of this claim and it is still unclear if this holds in complete generality .",
    "moreover , while the upper bound for adjacent intervals in a free - fermion chain gives exactly the same scaling behaviour as the cft prediction for the entanglement negativity , one should also test its performance for the case of non - adjacent intervals .",
    "unfortunately , this setup is much more involved since the analytic continuation from the moments of the partial transpose is not known @xcite . another interesting question is the negativity for non - adjacent intervals in the xx spin chain , where the results in the spin and fermionic basis are not equivalent @xcite , and thus the upper bound should also be properly generalized .",
    "regarding the lower bound , we observed that it performs particularly well in case of strong singlet - type entanglement between the subsystems .",
    "this makes it a good candidate to check the negativity scaling in random singlet phases of disordered spin chains , where the available dmrg results are not yet entirely conclusive @xcite .",
    "importantly , the bounds presented here constitute an excellent starting point for endeavors aimed at seeing topological signatures at finite temperatures , as the numerics for comparably small ssh chains already suggests .",
    "it is the hope that this work stimulates such further research . + _ note added . _ upon completion , we became aware of a recent independent work @xcite , where an alternative definition of fermionic entanglement negativity is considered . making use of a freedom in the representation of the partial transposition",
