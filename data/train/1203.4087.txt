    "in the present paper we study dynamics of a small ball moving vertically in a gravitational field and impacting with a periodically moving limiter ( a table ) .",
    "this model belongs to the field of nonsmooth and nonlinear dynamical systems @xcite . in such systems",
    "nonstandard bifurcations such as border - collisions and grazing impacts leading often to complex chaotic motions are typically present .",
    "it is important that nonsmooth systems have many applications in technology @xcite .    in the bouncing ball dynamics it is usually difficult or even impossible to solve nonlinear equation for an instant of the next impact .",
    "we approached this problem assuming a special motion of the table .",
    "recently , we have considered several models of motion of a material point in a gravitational field colliding with a limiter moving periodically with piecewise constant velocity @xcite and velocity depending linearly on time @xcite . in the present work we study the model in which periodic displacement of the table is a cubic function of time , carrying out our project to approximate the sinusoidal motion of the table as exactly as possible but preserving possibility of analytical computations aobr2010c .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 a one dimensional dynamics of a ball moving in a gravitational field and colliding with a table",
    "is reviewed and the corresponding poincar map is constructed .",
    "a bifurcation diagram is computed for displacement of the table assumed as cubic and periodic function of time . in the next section dynamical modes shown in the bifurcation diagram such as fixed points , @xmath0 - cycles and chaotic bands as well as the case of @xmath1 impacts in one interval of the limiter s motion",
    "are studied analytically and numerically .",
    "we summarize our results in section 4 .",
    "let a ball moves vertically in a constant gravitational field and collides with a periodically moving table .",
    "we treat the ball as a material point and assume that the limiter s mass is so large that its motion is not affected at impacts .",
    "dynamics of the ball from an impact to the next impact can be described by the following poincar map in nondimensional form aobr2007 ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite where analogous map was derived earlier and ref .",
    "@xcite for generalizations of the bouncing ball model ) :    [ tv ] @xmath2where @xmath3 denotes time of the @xmath4-th impact and @xmath5 is the corresponding post - impact velocity while @xmath6 .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 are a nondimensional acceleration and the coefficient of restitution , @xmath9 @xcite , respectively and the function @xmath10 represents the limiter s motion .    the table s motion has been usually assumed in form @xmath11 , cf . @xcite and references therein . in this case",
    "it is basically impossible to solve the eq.([t ] ) for @xmath12 .",
    "accordingly , we have decided to choose the limiter s periodic motion in a polynomial form to make analytical investigations of the dynamics possible . in our previous papers",
    "we have assumed displacement of the table as piecewise linear periodic function of time @xcite as well as quadratic aobr2010b . in this work",
    "we study dynamics for a cubic function of time @xmath13 :    [ c1 ] @xmath14with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the floor function  the largest integer less than or equal to @xmath17 ( i.e. @xmath18 ) .    since the period of motion of the limiter is equal to one , the map ( [ tv ] ) is invariant under the translation @xmath19 .",
    "accordingly , all impact times @xmath3 can be reduced to the unit interval @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the model consists thus of equations ( [ tv ] ) , ( c1 ) with control parameters @xmath8 , @xmath7 .    , @xmath21 $ ] . ]    in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] above we show the bifurcation diagram with impact times versus @xmath7 computed for growing @xmath7 and @xmath22 .",
    "it follows that dynamical system ( [ tv ] ) , ( [ c1 ] ) has several attractors : two fixed points which after one period doubling give rise to chaotic bands and two other fixed points which go to chaos via period doubling scenario .",
    "there are also several small attractors .",
    "we shall investigate some of these attractors in the next section combining analytical and numerical approach .",
    "general analytical conditions for birth of new modes of motion were given in @xcite .",
    "we shall first study periodic solutions with one impact per @xmath23 periods .",
    "such states have to fulfill the following conditions :    @xmath24    where:@xmath25    substituting these conditions into ( [ tv ] ) , ( [ c1 ] ) we obtain two sets of fixed points:@xmath26where the impact occurs in time interval @xmath27 and    @xmath28    with impacts taking place in time interval @xmath29 .    solutions ( [ fixsta ] ) fulfill physical requirements and are stable in the following interval of @xmath7:@xmath30where lower bound is a consequence of @xmath31 while the upper bound follows from the condition that eigenvalues @xmath32 of the stability matrix obey @xmath33 .",
    "accordingly , for @xmath22 there are only four stable fixed points with @xmath34 , shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ]  they appear at @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .    on the other hand , solutions ( [ fixusta ] )",
    "are always unstable and are physical for:@xmath37what is equivalent to the condition @xmath38 .",
    "let us note that @xmath0 - cycles are created from fixed points such that @xmath39 , \\ t_{i+1}\\in",
    "\\left [ k , k+1\\right ] $ ] with @xmath40 . therefore equations defining @xmath0 - cycles read:@xmath41where @xmath40 and @xmath42 are given by ( [ c1 ] ) .",
    "we know that @xmath0 - cycles appear for @xmath43 , cf .",
    "eq.([exst1 ] ) .",
    "we have solved the set of equations ( [ 2cycleg ] ) in closed form but we skip these lengthy formulae because of lack of space .    the bifurcation diagram shown in fig .",
    "1 suggests that in the case of two fixed points with @xmath44 transition to chaos occurs after the first period doubling when @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , in order to determine values of parameters at which the transition to chaos occurs , we have to solve eq.(2cycleg ) with condition @xmath46 . after this",
    "substitution equations ( 2cycleg ) are easily solved to yield :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 .",
    "for example , for @xmath22 and @xmath49 we get from ( [ sol ] ) @xmath50 while for @xmath22 and @xmath51 we obtain @xmath52 and indeed , precisely at this point on the @xmath7 axis , branches of the corresponding @xmath0 - cycles reach values @xmath45 and transform into chaotic bands",
    ". this scenario does not apply for @xmath22 and @xmath53 - in the case @xmath54 there is another period doubling prior to @xmath55 while for @xmath56 physical solutions of ( [ sol ] ) do not exist .      in the bouncing ball dynamics chattering and chaotic dynamics",
    "arise typically , see @xcite where chattering mechanism was studied numerically for sinusoidal motion of the table",
    ". due to simplicity of our model analytical computations are possible .",
    "let us assume that @xmath57 impacts , @xmath3 , @xmath12 , occur in the same period .",
    "then the solution @xmath58 of equation ( [ t ] ) is always present .",
    "we thus obtain from eqs.([t ] ) and ( [ ci ] ) :    [ dd ] @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath6 .",
    "we can now rewrite eqs.([tv ] ) in simplified form :    [ eqs ] @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a relative velocity and the solution @xmath63 , cf .",
    "( [ dd ] ) , was chosen .",
    "equations ( [ eqs ] ) define an _ explicit _ nonlinear map .",
    "this formalism makes possible analysis of chattering and grazing in the @xmath64 limit .",
    "it follows immediately that grazing manifold , @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath58 , exists only for @xmath66 and hence for    @xmath67    after computing eigenvalues @xmath68 of the stability matrix @xmath69  on the grazing manifold , @xmath70 , we get after straightforward calculations @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "it thus follows that the grazing manifold is always attracting in one eigendirection and neutral in another ( @xmath73 ) .    in the final stage of grazing @xmath74",
    "is very small .",
    "let @xmath75 .",
    "it follows that for @xmath76 , @xmath77 , we get the convergent expansion of the square - root in ( [ del ] ) : @xmath78and the inequality @xmath79",
    "implies:@xmath80    approximate equations describing chattering , obtained from the approximate equation ( [ approxdelta ] ) and exact equations ( [ eqs ] ) , are of form :    [ eqsapprox ] @xmath81and to ensure convergence @xmath82 we assume that @xmath83 ( i.e. @xmath84 )  this leads to the following condition for @xmath3 :    @xmath85    it is now possible to estimate time of @xmath1-th impact:@xmath86the time @xmath87 can be computed exactly since@xmath88where equations ( [ approxdelta ] ) , ( [ approxv ] ) were used , and thus@xmath89    if the ball impacts at time @xmath90 , performs infinite number of impacts and sticks ( in one interval of limiter s motion ) then the time is @xmath91 .",
    "solving the inequality @xmath92 we get conditions for grazing : @xmath93    finally , the ( approximate ) condition for grazing is : @xmath94 , cf .",
