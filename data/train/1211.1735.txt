    "interestingly , this result coincides with the one that is expected naively from the perturbation theory for original @xmath151 without taking mean - field approximation .",
    "this seems to indicate that it is possible to study this model in its quasi-1d limit directly from perturbation theory for @xmath151 . instead of pursuing along this direction",
    ", we shall determine the phase boundary by the numerical ed method below .      in this subsection ,",
    "the critical values of the interchain coupling @xmath8 are estimated by the ed method . here",
    "we follow the treatment in ref .   for quasi-1d heisenberg antiferromagnets .",
    "our ed results provide numerical evidences in supporting the above conclusions based on scaling arguments .    for the sake of ed calculations ,",
    "we assume here that only the @xmath182 component of the expectation value @xmath150 is nonzero .",
    "thus the effective 1d hamiltonian in eq .",
    "has still spin - rotation symmetry in the @xmath38 direction and the total @xmath38-component spin remains a conserved quantity .",
    "this reduces much computational effort and thus calculations for systems of large sizes become available . in consistent with eq .",
    ", the explicit form of @xmath183 is taken to be @xmath184 . substituting the present mean - field solution to eq .",
    ", the on - site part of the effective 1d hamiltonian becomes @xmath185 here the self - consistent field is again given by @xmath186 .    by taking @xmath165 as a free parameter ,",
    "we diagonalize numerically the effective single - chain model up to system length @xmath187 . for the present single - chain problem ,",
    "the order parameter for spin quadrupole ordering becomes @xmath188 this expression is compatible with the form of 2d order parameter used in this subsection .",
    "the results of @xmath86 as function of @xmath165 for several @xmath10 s with @xmath187 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_ed](a ) . the susceptibility @xmath189",
    "can then be evaluated from the slope of the linear fit as shown in the inset of this figure . within the present mean - field approach , to have a nonzero solution of @xmath86 , the slope @xmath190 of the tangent line around @xmath191 must be larger than that of the straight line , @xmath192 $ ] , given by the self - consistent relation .",
    "that is , long - range order appears only when @xmath193 $ ] .",
    "this requirement leads to a critical value @xmath161 of the interchain coupling for a given length @xmath194 , @xmath195 the size dependence of @xmath161 for various @xmath10 s is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1d_ed](b ) .",
    "as seen from this figure , size dependence of @xmath161 is more prominent as @xmath10 gets closer to @xmath101 .",
    "this reflects the fact that quantum fluctuations for the 1d systems become larger as @xmath10 approaches to the su(3 ) point , where more low - energy excitations appear .",
    "except for the case of @xmath110 , in which size effect may be profound , a smooth extrapolation of @xmath161 to zero in the thermodynamic limit is found for all @xmath10 s .",
    "this indicates that the 2d three - sublattice order will emerge for infinitesimal @xmath196 within the whole region of @xmath175 . in other words ,",
    "the phase transitions out of the three - sublattice states actually occur at infinite @xmath12 for original 2d anisotropic blbq model .",
    "thus our ed results lend strong support on the conclusions based on the scaling arguments discussed in the previous subsection .     as function of self - consistent field @xmath165 for various @xmath10",

    "lines are guide to eyes .",

    "( b ) critical value @xmath161 of the interchain coupling as function of @xmath197 .",
    "lines show the extrapolations in the thermodynamic limit by using data for the largest two sizes ( i.e. , @xmath198 and 18 ) . ]",
    "to summarize , we elaborate the effect of spatial anisotropy @xmath12 on the stability of the three - sublattice spin nematic state in the model of eq .   through various analytic as well as numerical approaches .",
    "we conclude that the three - sublattice state is stable for all @xmath199 within the whole region of @xmath46 .",
    "our analysis thus gives a complete picture for smooth crossover from the triangular - lattice case to both the square - lattice and the 1d - chain limits as the anisotropy @xmath12 is varied .",
    "moreover , our work provides some insights on the validity of the lfw theory .",
    "basically , the strength of the stability for the considered order can be understood within the simple lfw theory .",
    "nevertheless , the predicted phase boundaries and the excitation spectrums is merely suggestive , especially in both of the @xmath42 and @xmath109 limits . because the local constraints are released in the lfw analysis , it is interesting to see if great improvement can be obtained through other approaches ( say , the variational monte carlo method ) , in which these constraints are taken into account rigorously .",
    "such discussions go beyond the scope of the present work and deserve further investigations .",
