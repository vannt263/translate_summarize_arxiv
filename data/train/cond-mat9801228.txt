    "bethe lattices or cayley trees have often been the basis of very attractive models for the theoretical study of various properties of solids .",
    "a bethe lattice is completely characterized by the number of nearest neighbors @xmath15 and by the lack of closed loops .",
    "the later feature simplifies calculations considerably allowing in many cases to obtain useful insights on the physics of complex problems , for example , in theory of many electron systems or in the theory of alloys and other disordered systems .",
    "recently , the interest in the study of strongly correlated fermions on bethe lattices has been renewed by the advances achieved in the limit of infinite spatial dimensionality ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , this lattice provides a systematic mean of realizing the @xmath17 limit by letting @xmath18 and scaling the nearest neighbor ( nn ) hopping integrals as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 refers to the band width . in this context",
    ", an important research effort has been dedicated to the half - filled hubbard model .",
    "this concerns mainly the metal - insulator transition within the paramagnetic phase and also the properties of the antiferromagnetic phase which in the absence of frustrations is the most stable solution at low temperatures ( bipartite lattice ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be of considerable interest to determine the properties of the half - filled hubbard model on a bethe lattice with finite @xmath15 by using accurate numerical methods . such numerical studies could be very useful , particularly in view of the possibility of improving the @xmath21 equations by introducing @xmath22 corrections .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine several ground - state properties of the half - filled hubbard model on a @xmath0 bethe lattice as a function of the coulomb interaction strength @xmath5 . for this purpose",
    "we take advantage of a property that bethe lattices share with one - dimensional ( 1d ) chains , namely , the fact that there is only one path between any pair of sites in the system .",
    "this characteristic allows the design of a simple real - space renormalization scheme in order to apply the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method @xcite .",
    "density - matrix renormalization is a very powerful technique which was first proposed a few years ago in the context of 1d spin systems .",
    "since then it has been rapidly extended to become one of the leading numerical tools for the study of low - dimensional correlated quantum systems including recently two - dimensional lattices of finite size @xcite . the success and wide range of applications found by this approach rely on two main qualities : its high accuracy even for systems as large as a few hundreds of sites , which allows safe extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit , and its flexibility concerning the model hamiltonian under study ( heisenberg , @xmath23 , hubbard , kondo , etc ) .",
    "however , except for the work of otsuka on the spin-1/2 @xmath24 hamiltonian @xcite , the infinite dmrg calculations have always been limited to 1d problems . to our knowledge , this is the first time that the dmrg algorithm for infinite systems is applied to a fermion model not having the 1d topology .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section the main details of the application of the dmrg method to the bethe lattice",
    "are given .",
    "results for the ground - state energy and several spin and charge local properties are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we consider the hubbard hamiltonian @xcite @xmath25 on a bethe lattice with coordination number @xmath0 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bethe - lat1 ] ) . in the usual notation ,",
    "@xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath28 at site @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the number operator , @xmath31 refers to the nearest neighbor ( nn ) hopping integral , and @xmath32 to the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "several ground - state properties of the hubbard model are determined using the dmrg method @xcite .",
    "this is an iterative projection technique which allows to include the most relevant part of the ground - state wave function on a limited number of many - body states .",
    "the system is partitioned into several regions in real space or blocks between which renormalized interactions are computed .",
    "the accuracy of the method is controlled by the number of states @xmath33 retained for the description of each block . in the dmrg algorithm for infinite systems , the size of the system",
    "is increased at each renormalization step and the properties of the thermodynamic limit are determined by extrapolating the succession of finite system calculations .    the renormalization procedure used for the @xmath0 bethe lattice",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rg ] . starting from a central site @xmath34 and the two shells of its first and second nn s , a new shell of nn s",
    "is added at each iteration @xmath35 .",
    "the total number sites is thus given by @xmath36 .",
    "notice the contrast with the usual dmrg scheme for 1d systems where @xmath37 increases linearly with @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "the central site and its nn s ( the sites on the first shell ) are treated exactly at all iterations and the renormalizations are performed on the two branches which start at each of the first - shell sites ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rg ] ) . notice that no renormalization is actually done until @xmath38 , i.e. , the 10-site system with two sites in each block is treated exactly . in practice ,",
    "the extrapolations of the considered properties to @xmath39 converge after @xmath40 iterations . at this point @xmath41 .",
    "it should be however noted that in a bethe lattice the surface to volume ratio does not vanish with increasing number of shells @xmath42 .",
    "taking into account that the number of sites in the @xmath43th shell is @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , one finds for @xmath0 that 1/2 of the sites belong to the outermost shell , 1/4 to the first shell below the surface , 1/8 to the second shell below the surface and so forth .",
    "consequently , global properties of the system such the average ground - state energy per site @xmath46 are dominated by the outermost shells .",
    "bulk properties corresponding to the translational invariant situation have to be calculated locally .",
    "for instance , the ground - state energy per site @xmath1 is determined from @xmath47 by using the density matrix reduced to the central sites @xmath34 and @xmath48 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bethe - lat1 ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] it will be shown that the present dmrg algorithm yields accurate results for both global properties including the surface and local bulk - like properties .",
    "for the calculations we take advantage of a theorem by lieb which states that for @xmath49 the ground - state spin @xmath50 of the half - filled hubbard hamiltonian on a bipartite lattice is @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the number of sites belonging to the two sublattices @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 even ) @xcite . in the bethe lattice",
    "considered in this paper , even and odd shells constitute the two sublattices @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( nn hopping ) . at the renormalization iteration @xmath35 the ground - state spin",
    "is @xmath57 so that the calculations can be performed in the subspace of maximal @xmath58 .",
    "this exact result provides an important simplification which appears to be crucial in order to achieve reliable results with present computer facilities , since for @xmath58 the hilbert space is much smaller than for @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the number of states @xmath33 kept in the renormalized blocks can be reduced significantly without loss of accuracy .",
    "for example for @xmath60 , we have performed dmrg calculations by using @xmath61 and @xmath62 , keeping in both cases the same number of states @xmath63 in the renormalized blocks . after the first few iterations",
    "one finds important differences in the ground - state energy per site , the @xmath61 results being @xmath64 higher than those corresponding to @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , the sum @xmath65 of the retained eigenvalues of the density matrix  a good criterion to estimate the quality of a dmrg calculation @xcite  follows the same trend . indeed , for @xmath62 , @xmath66 is always smaller than @xmath67 while for @xmath61 , @xmath66 can be as large as @xmath68 , a value which in practice is too large for obtaining accurate results .",
    "in addition it should be noted that the uncorrelated limit is the most difficult case in dmrg calculations .",
    "@xmath66 is in fact always smaller for finite @xmath5 than for @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the results presented in this paper were obtained by keeping @xmath63 states in each renormalized block .",
    "this would correspond to @xmath69 possible configurations .",
    "however , only between @xmath70@xmath71 of them belong to the targeted @xmath58 subspace .",
    "still , the dimension of the superblock density - matrix , @xmath72 , is quite important , which renders the computations very demanding .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : ener ] results are given for the ground - state energy per site as a function of @xmath5 .    since in the bethe lattice",
    "the weight of the atoms close to the surface does not vanish with increasing number of shells , it necessary to discern between global properties which include surface contributions and local properties calculated close to the central site @xmath34 .",
    "the global energy @xmath46 ( dashed curve ) is derived by extrapolating the ground - state energy per site for @xmath73 . for @xmath60",
    "the dmrg calculations yield @xmath74 , while the exact results obtained by diagonalizing the finite-@xmath42 tight - binding matrix and extrapolating to @xmath73 is @xmath75 ( see appendix ) .",
    "the agreement seems quite remarkable since @xmath46 is given by the contributions of the atoms of the outermost shells   1/2 of the sites belong to the surface , 1/4 to the layer below the surface , etc .",
    " which are renormalized already from the very first iterations .",
    "similarly good results are obtained for the local ground - state energy @xmath1 ( solid curve ) which is obtained from the density matrices at the central sites extrapolated for @xmath73 . for @xmath60",
    ", we obtain @xmath76 , while the integral of the single - particle density of states of the bethe lattice is @xmath77 .",
    "the renormalized blocks thus provide a proper embedding of the central sites .",
    "it is worth noting that the accuracy of these results , derived by keeping only @xmath63 states per block and setting @xmath62 at each iteration , is comparable to the accuracy of calculations with @xmath78@xmath79 in the 1d hubbard model ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "it goes without saying that @xmath78 calculations on a bethe lattice are hardly feasible with present computer facilities .",
    "since the uncorrelated limit is the most difficult ( less precise ) case in dmrg calculations on the hubbard model @xcite , we may expect that the results for finite @xmath5 are at least as accurate .",
    "this is also confirmed by the sum @xmath65 of the retained eigenvalues of the block density - matrix which increases with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath46 increase monotonously with @xmath5 and vanish as expected in the heisenberg limit .",
    "their @xmath5 dependence are very similar .",
    "in fact , allowing for a rescaling of the energies at @xmath60 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are close to the corresponding results for the 1d hubbard chain @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , @xmath46 is always higher than @xmath1 due to surface boundary effects .",
    "surface sites at the outermost shell have a smaller local coordination number @xmath82 .",
    "therefore the effective local band width and the binding energy of surface sites are smaller than in the bulk .",
    "several local properties have been calculated around the central site @xmath34 in order to analyze the behavior of the ground - state in the bulk limit .",
    "results for the average local magnetic moment @xmath83 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sz ] .",
    "@xmath83 increases monotonously with @xmath5 reaching @xmath84 in the heisenberg limit .",
    "this reflects the formation of a spin - density wave ( sdw ) in which the average spins on the two sublattices @xmath54 and @xmath55 point in opposite directions . indeed , for nn sites ( @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath48 ) we obtain @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "notice that the calculated @xmath83 does not vanish in the uncorrelated limit as it should . from the tight - binding solution for the bethe lattice with a finite number of shells @xmath42 one obtains @xmath88 for @xmath42 even and @xmath89 for @xmath42 odd ( see the appendix ) .",
    "thus , in finite - size systems with even @xmath42 the local magnetization does not vanish even for @xmath60 ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "our dmrg calculations follow precisely the exact results during the first renormalization iterations but for large @xmath35 a slight increase of @xmath83 is observed for @xmath42 odd which yields a small non - zero value in the extrapolation to @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "we expect that this inaccuracy will be remedied by increasing the number of states kept in each renormalized block . in any case",
    ", since the dmrg method has better convergence properties with increasing @xmath5 , the precision of the results improves rapidly for finite values of the interaction .",
    "in fact , in the strongly correlated limit the calculated @xmath92 is in very good agreement with perturbative estimations and with dmrg calculations using the heisenberg hamiltonian .    in order to analyze the strongly interacting heisenberg limit we approximate the ground - state wave function by including first - order perturbations to the nel state @xmath93 : @xmath94 notice that the coefficient of the first - order correction ( spin - flip states ) is independent of the exchange constant @xmath95 , since the off - diagonal matrix elements ( @xmath96 ) and the energy differences [ @xmath97 are both proportional to @xmath98 in the heisenberg model .",
    "the average of local operators @xmath99 [ e.g. , @xmath100 or @xmath101 are obtained from @xmath102   \\over { \\rm tr } [ \\hat \\rho ] } \\ ; , \\label{eq : avo}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 refers to the reduced density matrix .",
    "for example , for a single site eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi1 ] ) yields @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in this way one obtains @xmath107 , which compares very well with the dmrg result @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "we conclude that the reduction of @xmath6 with respect to the saturation value 1/2 at very large @xmath5 is the result of quantum spin fluctuations involving the first nn shell of atom @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , we have also performed dmrg calculations for the heisenberg model on the @xmath0 bethe lattice which confirm the hubbard results at @xmath110 [ @xmath111 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : sz ] ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vsz ] results are given for the fluctuation of the local magnetic moments at a single site and at pairs of nn and nnn sites .",
    "in all cases @xmath112 presents a maximum for @xmath11@xmath12 .",
    "this behavior is a consequence of the interplay between the @xmath113 increase which is due to the reduction of the weight of doubly occupied and empty sites by correlations , and the formation of permanent magnetic moments @xmath114 , which reduces the fluctuation of the spin moments around their average ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sz ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sz2 ] , @xmath115 in the bethe lattice increases monotonously with @xmath5 very much like in the 1d hubbard chain .",
    "the main qualitative difference between bethe - lattice and 1d results for @xmath116 comes from @xmath114 which is zero for the 1d case .",
    "notice that the dmrg calculations are in good quantitative agreement with the tight - binding analytic results ( open circles , @xmath60 ) , with independent dmrg calculations for the spin-@xmath7 heisenberg model ( dots , @xmath117 ) as well as with the first - order - perturbation estimation from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psi1 ] ) and ( [ eq : avo ] ) ( open circles , @xmath117 ) .",
    "the spin correlation functions @xmath118 between nn and nnn sites @xmath29 and @xmath119 are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : flcorr ] .",
    "nn spins show antiferromagnetic correlations which tend to become stronger as @xmath5 increases . a shallow maximum",
    "is observed approximately at the same value of @xmath5 for which @xmath112 is maximal .",
    "notice that a considerable part of the antiferromagnetic correlations between nn is already present for @xmath60 .",
    "in contrast , the spin correlations between nnn s are much weaker . in this case",
    ", parallel alignment is slightly favored as @xmath5 increases [ @xmath120 .",
    "these trends are consistent with the sign alternations found in @xmath6 for @xmath29 belonging to different sublattices ( sdw ) .",
    "as expected , good agreement is obtained between the hubbard results for large @xmath5 and independent dmrg calculations for the the heisenberg model .",
    "the first - order estimates [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : psi1 ] ) ] are somewhat less accurate in this case but still remain qualitatively correct .",
    "the average density @xmath121 at the central sites @xmath34 and @xmath48 is very close to 1 independently of @xmath5 , which confirms the expected absence of a charge - density wave for @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the fluctuations of the density at a single site and at pairs of nn and nnn sites are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : vne ] .    in all cases",
    "we observe a monotonic crossover from the uncorrelated regime ( @xmath124 maximal ) to the strongly correlated , localized regime where charge fluctuations are suppressed .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence is quite similar to what is obtained for 1d hubbard model .",
    "the density fluctuation at a pair of nnn sites ( dotted curve ) is approximately twice the single - site result ( solid curve ) which indicates , as in the case of the spin degrees of freedom , that density correlations between nnn s are very weak [ @xmath125 .",
    "in contrast , for nn sites charge fluctuations are significantly smaller .",
    "one observes that @xmath126 ^ 2 \\rangle -   \\langle \\hat n(0 ) + \\hat",
    "n(1)\\rangle^2 \\simeq   ( 3/2 ) [ \\langle \\hat n(0)^2   \\rangle - \\langle \\hat n(0)\\rangle^2]$ ] or equivalently @xmath127/2 $ ] . notice that these relations hold approximately for all values of @xmath5 , even for @xmath60 .",
    "the ratio between single - site charge fluctuations and fluctuations on a pair of nn s is not much affected by changes in the coulomb repulsion strength and therefore seems to result mainly from the geometrical proximity of nn sites .",
    "several ground - state properties of the half - filled hubbard model have been determined on the bethe lattice with coordination @xmath0 by using a density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm for open infinite systems .",
    "though the lattice is not one dimensional ( 1d ) , the existence of a unique path between any pair of sites allows to formulate a simple renormalization procedure .",
    "in contrast to previous density - matrix renormalizations studies of hubbard - like models on 1d chains or ladders where the number of sites @xmath37 increases linearly with the number of iterations @xmath35 , in the present approach @xmath37 increases exponentially with @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) . this is a consequence of the fact that 2 blocks are renormalized into a single one at each iteration . despite the very rapid increase of @xmath37 ,",
    "the dmrg method provides accurate results over the whole range of @xmath5 already by keeping few states per block ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this is achieved by working in the subspace of maximal spin projection @xmath58 , where the ground - state spin @xmath128 is derived from a theorem by lieb @xcite .",
    "for example , in the limit of @xmath60 the calculated ground - state energy per site differs by only @xmath129 from the exact tight - binding result .",
    "it is remarkable that this level of precision concerns not only local properties calculated at the unrenormalized central sites , but also global properties which are dominated by the renormalized sites of the outermost shells . from a general point of view",
    ", the present study encourages renormalizations of more than one block into a superblock in future dmrg algorithms .",
    "the main results for the @xmath0 bethe lattice may be summarized as follows .",
    "the calculated local magnetic moments @xmath6 increase monotonically with increasing coulomb repulsion @xmath5 forming an antiferromagnetic spin - density - wave state which matches the two sublattices of the bipartite bethe lattice .",
    "the maximum @xmath6 found in the heisenberg limit ( @xmath130 ) is reduced with respect to the saturation value @xmath131 as a result of exchange flips between the spin at site @xmath29 and its nn s that point in opposite directions .",
    "the fluctuations of the local spins @xmath10 show a maximum as a function of @xmath5 for @xmath11@xmath12 . for small @xmath5 the usual increase of @xmath13 due to the reduction of double occupations dominates , while for large @xmath5 the formation of large permanent moments @xmath14 blocks local spin fluctuations .",
    "nn sites show important antiferromagnetic spin correlations which increase with increasing coulomb repulsion .",
    "however , nnn sites are very weakly correlated over the whole range of @xmath5 .",
    "the af correlations are very short ranged in contrast to the static picture of a sdw .",
    "this reflects the importance of quantum fluctuations in the @xmath0 bethe lattice as in 1d systems .",
    "taking into account that the bethe lattice is one of the standard models for the studying the limit of infinite dimensions , it would be very interesting to compare the present results for @xmath0 with the outcome of the @xmath17 equations in order to quantify the importance of @xmath132 corrections .",
    "moreover , further dmrg investigations including nnn hoppings should be very valuable for a better understanding of the metal - insulator transition in the presence of frustrations , particularly since the information derived from the dmrg method is complementary to finite - temperature quantum monte - carlo calculations .",
