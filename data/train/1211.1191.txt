    "heavy ion collisions at high energy involve in a crucial way the partons with a very small longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath0 of the the nucleon to which they belong .",
    "for instance , in heavy ion collisions at the lhc , where the center of mass energy is @xmath1tev per nucleon pair and where the typical produced particle has a transverse momentum of only a few gevs , one probes partons with a momentum fraction @xmath2 or lower . in this region ,",
    "the valence quarks are completely negligible , and most of the partons are in fact gluons ( see @xcite for instance ) . the distribution of sea quarks  produced by the splittings @xmath3is suppressed by a power of @xmath4 compared to the gluon distribution .    as long as the gluon occupation number remains of order one or smaller",
    ", the evolution with @xmath0 of the gluon distributions is governed by the ( linear ) bfkl equation @xcite .",
    "the evolution of these distributions with @xmath0 is driven by soft gluon radiation  : when one computes inclusive observables beyond leading order , they contain contributions that have large logarithms of @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that these logarithms have a universal structure , and can be resummed simply by making the gluon distributions @xmath0-dependent ( with an @xmath0-dependence dictated by the bfkl equation ) .",
    "this is a particular example of _ factorization _ , known as @xmath6-factorization in this case since it involves transverse momentum dependent gluon distributions @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that causality plays a crucial role in factorization : it is because the two projectiles can not be in causal contact before they collide that their partonic content is an intrinsic property that does not depend on what they collide with , nor on what observable is going to be measured in the final state .    in the regime of very small values of @xmath0 ,",
    "probed in high energy heavy ion collisions , one may reach values of the gluon occupation number that are much larger than one .",
    "this is in fact a consequence of the bfkl equation , that predicts a growth of the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is some positive exponent . when the occupation number is large , non - linear interactions among the gluons , such as recombinations , become important  @xcite .",
    "these processes tend to stop the growth of the occupation number when it reaches a value of the order @xmath9 , a phenomenon known as _",
    "gluon saturation_. the domain where saturation effects are important is delineated by a characteristic momentum scale , the saturation scale @xmath10 , that depends both on @xmath0 and on the nucleus size @xmath11 ( it increases for smaller @xmath0 and for larger nuclei ) .",
    "computing observables in the saturation regime is a challenge for several reasons .",
    "firstly , since gluon recombinations are important , processes may be initiated by more than a single gluon from each projectile .",
    "the consequence is that in order to predict anything , one needs informations about the distribution of multigluon states in the wavefunctions of the two incoming projectiles .",
    "given these multigluon distributions , the second difficulty is to compute observables from them .",
    "indeed , when the gluon occupation number is of order @xmath12 , computing an observable at a given order in @xmath4 requires to resum an infinite set of feynman graphs . finally ,",
    "as was already the case in the dilute regime , these observables receive large logarithmic corrections at higher orders .",
    "but now , these logarithms may be more complicated because their coefficients may be sensitive to the multigluon states mentioned above",
    ". it would be highly desirable to show that these logarithms are still universal ( a property that we expect to be true from causality ) , and that they can be factorized into evolved multigluon distributions .",
    "the color glass condensate ( cgc ) is an effective theory , based on qcd , in which these computations can be carried out ( see @xcite for an account of the early developments and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the main simplification compared to full fledged qcd stems from the realization that the fast partons in a nucleon or nucleus have a large lorentz boost factor that slows down their dynamics , so that they can be considered as static for the duration of a collision at high energy  @xcite .",
    "this allows to describe them as time independent color currents that fly along the trajectories of the two projectiles ( in the light - cone directions @xmath13 ) , whose transverse distribution reflects the position in the transverse plane of these fast partons at the time of the collision .",
    "all we know about these currents is the probability distribution @xmath14 $ ] for the density @xmath15 of the color charges that produce them .",
    "in contrast , no simplification is made to the dynamics of the slower partons , and therefore they are described as standard gauge fields , eikonally coupled to the color current of the fast partons .",
    "the two types of degrees of freedom ( color sources and gauge fields ) are separated by a cutoff @xmath16 on the longitudinal momentum on the momentum @xmath17 for the right moving nucleus and a cutoff @xmath18 for the momentum @xmath19 in the left moving nucleus . ] . in order to compute the expectation value of an observable in this framework ,",
    "one first computes it for a fixed @xmath20 , and then averages the result over all possible @xmath20 s according to the probability distribution @xmath14 $ ] .    in the cgc framework ,",
    "the power counting appropriate to the description of the saturated regime should assume that @xmath21 , in order to select all the relevant graphs when the gluon occupation number is of order @xmath22 . under this assumption , one sees easily that observables can be expanded in powers of @xmath23 , each successive order corresponding to an additional loop .",
    "the main difference with the @xmath23 expansion in the dilute regime is that there are now an infinite set of graphs contributing at each order  the leading order ( lo ) corresponds to all the tree diagrams , the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) to all the 1-loop graphs , etc .",
    "moreover , the tree diagrams that contribute to inclusive observables can be organized in such a way that they contain only retarded propagators @xcite .",
    "consequently , the gluon inclusive spectrum at lo can be expressed in terms of retarded classical solutions of the yang - mills equations  @xcite .",
    "likewise , the quark spectrum is given at lo by solutions of the dirac equation in the presence of the previous classical fields @xcite .",
    "because the cgc is an effective theory with two types of degrees of freedom , loop integrals should be cutoff at @xmath24 to avoid double counting contributions that are already included via the color currents that describe the fast partons .",
    "however , some of these loop integrals contain logarithms of the cutoff  making observables depend on an unphysical parameter that has been introduced by hand . in the case of reactions involving a single nucleus , such as deep inelastic scattering",
    ", it is well known that these logarithms can be absorbed into a redefinition of the probability distribution @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "this redefinition amounts to letting @xmath25 become cutoff dependent , with a cutoff dependence controlled by the jimwlk equation . when @xmath14 $ ] obeys the jimwlk equation , the cutoff dependence in @xmath25 precisely cancels the cutoff dependence from the loop integrals , leading to observables that are cutoff independent .",
    "moreover , it is this scale dependence of the distributions @xmath25 that gives observables their rapidity dependence ( for instance , the gluon spectrum computed in the cgc framework at lo is totally independent of rapidity , and becomes rapidity dependent after these logarithms have been resummed ) .    proving the factorization of the logarithms of the cutoffs in the case of nucleus - nucleus collisions is more complicated .",
    "the main difficulty is that  already at lo ",
    "observables can not be calculated analytically because this involves solving the classical yang - mills equations in the presence of the two strong currents that describe the fast partons of the two nuclei . at nlo",
    ", one needs to compute 1-loop graphs in this classical background field , which again can not be done analytically .",
    "this is where causality becomes very handy  : the above mentioned technical difficulties arise only in the forward light - cone , i.e. after the collision has happened , while the physics that controls the logarithms we want to compute happens before the collision , in the wavefunctions of the two projectiles . in @xcite , we have developed a method for separating these two stages of the time evolution in the case of the inclusive gluon spectrum , and we have shown that this separation indeed allows one to extract analytically the leading logarithms and to prove that they can be factorized in jimwlk evolved @xmath25 distributions ( one for each nucleus ) . at the moment , this factorization has been shown for inclusive observables involving only gluons .",
    "for instance , the computation of the inclusive quark spectrum done in @xcite assumes that such a factorization also works for quark production , although this has not been demonstrated so far .",
    "the cornerstone of this method is a functional relationship between the spectrum at lo and at nlo , that makes this separation explicit ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : g - nlo ] ) for this formula in the case of the single gluon spectrum ) .",
    "it was later found that the same separation can be made for more complicated observables , such as the inclusive multigluon spectra @xcite , or the energy - momentum tensor , thereby allowing one to prove the factorization of their logarithms of @xmath24 .",
    "an important question toward extending factorization to other observables is the range of validity of these relationships between their tree - level and 1-loop contributions . in this paper , we show that such formulae also exist in theories that have not only gluons , but also other fields that couple to gluons . for simplicity , we consider only scalar fields , but the extension of our second example to quarks would be straightforward ( apart from the complications related to dealing with spinors rather than scalars ) .    in the section [ sec : glue ]",
    ", we provide a brief reminder of existing results concerning the gluon spectrum at lo and nlo , and the factorization of its logarithms .",
    "more importantly , we provide a diagrammatic method for manipulating the objects and operators that arise in the formulae we wish to generalize .",
    "all these pictorial representations are in a one - to - one correspondence with some equations , but provide a much simpler and intuitive way of manipulating them . in the section [ sec : scal1 ] , we extend this result to some hypothetical color neutral scalar particle that couples to a pair of gluons . because such a field does not see directly the background field",
    ", the results of pure yang - mills theory also apply here without any change .",
    "the main part of the paper is the section [ sec : scal2 ] , where we consider colored scalar fields that live in the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "these fields have nontrivial interactions with the background gauge field . the main result of this section is the eq .",
    "( [ eq : theta - nlo ] ) , a natural generalization of the formula we had obtained for the gluon spectrum , that relates the lo and nlo spectra .",
    "the section [ sec : summary ] is devoted to a summary and concluding remarks .",
    "the single inclusive gluon spectrum can be expressed as follows in terms of the color field operator @xmath26  : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the on - shell energy of the produced gluon and @xmath29 is the polarization vector . in the inclusive spectrum , one should sum over all the possible polarizations @xmath8 and colors @xmath30 of the produced gluon .",

    "this is reminded by the subscripts @xmath32 and @xmath33 carried by the two field operators .    in the color glass condensate framework , gluons are coupled to an external classical color source @xmath34 that describes the fast partons contained in the two projectiles .",
    "this means that there is a non - zero disconnected part in the above two - point function , that must be taken into account .",
    "moreover , in the regime where the two projectiles are saturated ( as is the case in heavy ion collisions ) , one should assume in the power counting that this source is parametrically of order @xmath35 . under these conditions ,",
