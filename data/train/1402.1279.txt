    "negative refraction is an exotic refractive process which can be applied on high resolution lenses to overcome optical diffraction limits@xcite , local field enhancements@xcite , and high - sensitivity detections@xcite . in 1968 , veselago first investigated the electromagnetic properties of negative index material ( nim)@xcite .",
    "it was not until the late 1990s , pendry _ _ et al.__@xcite introduced the use of metamaterial which allowed nim to become a prosperous field of study .",
    "et al . _ also pointed out that metamaterial can be realized by a kind of conductive ring with a split pointing to a specific direction which is called split - ring resonators ( srrs)@xcite . after two years , it was experimentally realized by shelby _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "this remarkable discovery makes srr and metamaterial @xcite new branch of research , including liquid crystal magnetic control@xcite , cloaking@xcite and toroidal dipole moments@xcite , _",
    "etc_. however , metamaterials normally act on specific wavelength ranges that depend on the sizes of building circuits .",
    "for example , the experimental measurement of srr is made in @xmath0 mm cell dimension and operates on microwave with wavelength @xmath1 cm@xcite . to find visible - frequency nim , the challenge is to make arrays of srr in nanometer scale .",
    "during the past decade , researchers have manufactured srrs with sizes ranging from a few minimeters@xcite to several hundreds of nanometers@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we research a class of one - dimensional metal string complexes , which is also called extended metal atom chains ( emacs ) , for potential application as molecular - scale srrs ( msrrs ) .",
    "emacs are linear strings of transition metal atoms with four polypyridylamido ligands wrapping around them .",
    "although there exist a number of metallic nanowires @xcite already , emacs are in fact the thinnest molecular electrical wires@xcite that can show intriguing magnetism and large single - molecule conductances@xcite . since the extended ligands of emacs are generally pyridyl chains , they offer great configurations of well ordered arrays of conjugated rings , which can also be modeled as gentile oscillators of intermediate statistics @xcite .",
    "we wish to point out in this paper that the extended ligands of emacs are in fact a new type of molecular srrs .",
    "the special configuration of polypyridylamido ligands around the central metal string in emacs makes the negative refraction possible .",
    "moreover , due to the quantum confinement of @xmath2-electrons in the pyridyl groups , emacs as the negative refractive index materials are promising to realize simultaneous negativity for both electric permittivity and magnetic permeability in the uv - vis region .    this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we give the theoretical derivation of the permittivity and permeability of emacs using a simple tight - binding model .",
    "three dimensional helical configuration of ligands are both discussed in section iii . finally , in section iv , the main results are concluded and future work is discussed .",
    "the configuration of a one - dimensional metal string complex that consists of five transition metal atoms arranged in the linear string with twelve pyridyl units acting as molecular srrs helically wrapping around them is shown in figure  [ fig : one ] . in our current study",
    ", we will treat these pyridyl units as independent quantum subsystems . for simplicity , we focus on the shortest emacs containing only three transition metal atoms and eight molecular srrs ( see figure [ fig : emacs-1 ] ) .",
    "( tpda = tripyridylamide ) .",
    "axial ligands are not shown .",
    "this one - dimensional metal string complex consists of five transition metal atoms ( blue ) and twelve single - nitrogen - substituted heterocyclic annulenes as their ligands ( gray ) .",
    "[ fig : one ] ]    ]    figure  [ fig : emacs-1](a ) shows the structure of a dipyridylamido ligand in a trinuclear emac complex .",
    "the green box presents a single heteronuclear pyridyl unit consisting of five carbon atoms ( white balls ) and one nitrogen atom ( blue ball ) .",
    "we will demonstrate later that each pyridyl unit in an emac complex actually corresponds a molecular srr . in figure",
    "[ fig : emacs-1](b ) , three transition metal atoms ( gray balls ) serve as the backbone which holds two molecular srrs in a helical arrangement with a dihedral angle @xmath3 between two pyridyl units that are linked by a single amido group . with all four dipyridylamido ligands attached on the metal string with a four - fold rotational symmetry , we get an emac complex ( figure  [ fig : emacs-1](c ) ) .     axis perpendicular to the plane .",
    "the six sites are labeled sequentially from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , with site @xmath4 to be a nitrogen atom and others to be carbon atoms.[fig : two ] ]      the electromagnetic properties mainly originate from the response of @xmath2 electrons of the ligands to the external electromagnetic fields .",
    "we label six @xmath6 orbitals in one of the eight pyridyl groups according to figure  [ fig : two ] .",
    "since each ligand consists of two pyridyl units linked by an amido group , without loss of generality , we will assume that these pyridyl units are independent and can be modeled by the hckel model as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath9-atomic orbital at site @xmath10 with site energy @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the coupling strength between @xmath10th and @xmath13th sites . here ,",
    "the cyclic condition is employed , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the only nitrogen atom is located at site 1 . therefore ,",
    "@xmath15 the hckel hamiltonian ( [ eq : hhu ] ) can be diagonalized numerically as latexmath:[\\ ] ] and they correspond to the first - order and higher - order perturbation corrections to the energies of molecular orbital energies , respectively .",
    "note that the degeneracies are not removed by the diagonal terms , i.e. @xmath140 and @xmath141 . incorporating the couplings between the degenerate molecular orbitals , the unperturbed hamiltonian can be analytically diagonalized as @xmath142 where @xmath143 , for @xmath144 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , for other @xmath147 s , we have @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 . the matrix elements of dipole operator for the transition to the lowest excited state",
    "can also be evaluated straightforwardly @xmath153 where we have made use of @xmath154 . because @xmath155 has a greater component in the @xmath69 direction than in the @xmath156 direction",
    ", we would expect @xmath157 to be sufficiently larger than @xmath158 .    on the other hand , due to the symmetry of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath159 ,",
    "the diagonal matrix elements of the displacement operator vanish , i.e. @xmath160 as a result , all @xmath161 s disappear to the present order , and their contribution originates from the next order due to the presence of @xmath162 . and",
    "it also suggests that due to the presence of nitrogen atom , the one - atom - substituted hckel model makes an ssr and thus can interact with the applied magnetic field .",
    "besides , we also remark that the molecular ssr can be realized by molecules other than emacs .",
    "for example , ( p)-2,2-biphenol  @xcite is two connected phenol where a hydrogen atom of benzene is replaced by a hydroxyl group . in this molecule , due to the presence of a hydroxyl group , the site energy and two coupling constants of the connected carbon atom are modified .",
    "furthermore , since the two phenol are not in the same plane , this molecule could response to the eletromagnetic field in all three dimensions .",
    "another possible candidate is 2,5-dichloropyrazine  @xcite where two nitrogen atoms are substituted for two carbon atoms and two hydrogen atoms are replaced by two chlorine atoms . in this molecule , due to this chemical tuning , the energy spectrum of the excited states is significantly adjusted . therefore",
    ", our proposal may work not only in emacs but also in molecules with a srr configuration .",
    "in this paper , we discover a new family of conjugated molecules that have the potential to exhibit negative refractive index in the uv - vis region .",
    "the molecules of interest are single - nitrogen - substituted heterocyclic annulenes , in which heteroatoms serves as splits to turn on magnetic resonance as their classical analogue . with heterocyclic annulenes as molecular split - ring resonators ( ssrs ) ,",
    "we show that extended metal atom chains ( emacs ) can realize negative permittivity and permeability simultaneously in quantum regime .",
    "a simple tight - binding calculation based on linear response within the electric and magnetic dipole approximations gives a reasonable estimate of the negative index region of the three dimensional and helical arrangement of these molecular ssrs .",
    "although we have adopted a simplified independent electron model , the coulombic interaction between electrons should not destroy the prediction of negative refraction .",
    "furthermore , besides emacs , a family of single - nitrogen - substituted heterocyclic annulenes may also serve as the negative refraction materials if the molecules are appropriately arranged .",
