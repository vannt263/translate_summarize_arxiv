    "it has been shown by both heuristic and rigorous methods@xcite that the lower critical dimension below which no long - range order is possible is @xmath9 for the rfim and @xmath10 for rf models with a continuous symmetry ( @xmath0 with @xmath11 ) .",
    "the same conclusion applies to ra models with the restriction that only ferromagnetic ( to use a magnetic terminology ) long - range order is forbidden below @xmath10 ; another type of long - range order associated to a spin - glass phase is still possible.@xcite here , we only consider ra models with isotropic distributions of the random anisotropies and with @xmath11 ; for anisotropic distributions , long - range ferromagnetic ordering may still occur below @xmath10 , whereas ra makes no real sense for @xmath6 , the model reducing then either to the random temperature ising model or to the pure ising model depending on the details of the effective hamiltonian.@xcite    two central issues remain under active debate .",
    "the first one is about the so - called dimensional reduction property .",
    "standard perturbation theory predicts to all orders that the critical behavior of an @xmath0 model in the presence of rf is the same as that of the pure model , _",
    "i.e. _ with no rf , in two dimensions less.@xcite the same applies to the ra@xmath0 m with @xmath11 near the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition.@xcite dimensional reduction is known however to break down , its most striking failure being the prediction of a lower critical dimension @xmath12 for the rfim in contradiction with the exact result ( see above ) .",
    "a proper description of the long - distance behavior of rf and ra models must thus provide a way out of the dimensional reduction .",
    "the second issue concerns the phase diagram of the rf and ra models with a continuous symmetry ( @xmath11 ) in dimensions below @xmath1 , which of course are relevant to the physical situations .",

    "the critical behavior is controlled by a zero - temperature fixed point at which temperature is formally irrelevant . at this fixed point",
    "the _ renormalized _ effective action is a nonanalytic function of its arguments ( the order parameter fields ) .",
    "although present , the nonanalyticity is weak enough in region iv to let the critical exponents take their dimensional reduction value ( corrections to scaling may nonetheless differ from the dimensional reduction predictions ) . in regions",
    "i and ii the nonanalyticity takes the form of a cusp in the renormalized second cumulant of the random field , which leads to a complete breakdown of dimensional reduction . finally , the whole qlro phase in region ii is also controlled by a zero - temperature fixed point characterized by a cusp .",
    "there is undoubtedly room for improving the quantitative predictions of our np - frg theory , in terms of both the number of observables studied and , more importantly , of the accuracy of the ( necessary ) approximations involved .",
