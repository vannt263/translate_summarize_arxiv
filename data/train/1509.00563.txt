    "this di - hadron and single - proton cross section measurements are based on data samples of @xmath1 and @xmath5 , respectively , collected with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath15 ( 3.5  gev on 8  gev ) collider  @xcite operating at the @xmath2 resonance ( denoted as on - resonance ) as well as 60 mev below for comparison ( denoted as continuum ) .    the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter comprised of csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside of the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath27 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "two inner detector configurations were used .",
    "a 2.0 cm beampipe with 1 mm thickness and a 3-layer svd were used for the first sample of @xmath28 , while a 1.5 cm beampipe , a 4-layer svd and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining @xmath29(@xmath5 for the single - hadron analysis ) @xcite .",
    "the primary light- and charm - quark simulations used in this analysis were generated with pythia6.2 @xcite , embedded into the evtgen @xcite framework , followed by a geant3 @xcite simulation of the detector response .",
    "the various mc samples were produced separately for light ( @xmath30 ) and charm quarks .",
    "in addition , we generated charged and neutral @xmath31 meson pairs from @xmath2 decays in evtgen , @xmath32 pair events with the kkmc @xcite generator and the tauola @xcite decay package , and other events with either pythia or dedicated generators @xcite .",
    "events with at least three reconstructed charged tracks must have a visible energy of charged tracks and neutral clusters above 7 gev ( to remove @xmath32 pair events ) and either a heavy jet mass ( the greater of the two invariant masses of all particles in a hemisphere ) above 1.8 gev / c@xmath33 or a ratio of the heavy jet mass to visible energy above 0.25 .    tracks must be within 4 cm ( 2 cm ) of the event vertex along ( perpendicular to ) the positron beam axis .",

    "@xcite , the same selection criteria must be applied to define a charged track as a pion , kaon , proton , electron or muon .",
    "the information is determined from normalized likelihood ratios that are constructed from various detector responses .",
    "if the muon - hadron likelihood ratio is above 0.9 , the track is identified as a muon .",
    "otherwise , if the electron - hadron likelihood ratio is above 0.85 , the track is identified as an electron . if neither of these applies , the track is identified as a kaon by a kaon - pion likelihood ratio above 0.6 and a kaon - proton likelihood ratio above 0.2 .",
    "pions are identified with the kaon - pion likelihood ratio below 0.6 and a pion - proton ratio above 0.2 .",
    "finally , protons are identified with the inverse proton ratios above with kaon - proton and pion - proton ratios below 0.2 .",
    "while neither muons nor electrons are considered explicitly for the single and di - hadron analysis , they are retained as necessary contributors for the pid correction , wherein a certain fraction enter the pion , kaon and proton samples under study .",
    "in the following sections , the di - hadron yields are extracted and , successively , the various corrections and the corresponding systematic uncertainties are applied to arrive at the di - hadron differential cross sections @xmath37 .      for the di - hadron cross sections , a ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) binning is used .",
    "we forgo a combined @xmath11 and invariant - mass binning of the hadron pair ; the latter , in particular , is relevant in the _",
    "same_-hemisphere topology as an unpolarized baseline to the previously extracted interference fragmentation functions @xcite and would have allowed the extraction of individual fragmentation functions for @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and other resonances .",
    "the @xmath25 and @xmath26 ranges of 0.2 to 1.0 used in this analysis are each partitioned into 16 equidistant bins .",
    "all hadron and charge combinations are treated independently and are merged only after all corrections are applied and after confirming their consistency where applicable ( _ i.e. , _ where the same combinations of fragmentation functions appear , such as @xmath41 and @xmath42 )",
    ". this leaves 16 different charge and type combinations for pions and kaons initially , of which six contain irreducible information .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in the introduction , three hemisphere combinations are studied : two hadrons in the same hemisphere , two hadrons in opposite hemispheres , and two hadrons irrespective of hemisphere or thrust cut ; these are abbreviated hereinafter as _ same _ , _ opposite _ , and _ any _ , respectively .          as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the particle misidentification is corrected via inverted @xmath43 particle - misidentification matrices for the five particle hypotheses ( pions , kaons , protons , muons , and electrons ) for each identified particle , laboratory momentum , and polar angle bin .",
    "these matrices are obtained using decays of @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 from data where the true particle type is determined by the charge reconstruction and the invariant mass distribution .",
    "occasionally , when too few events are available in the data , the extracted efficiencies are interpolated and/or extrapolated based on the behavior in the generic mc ; this occurs particularly at the boundaries of the acceptance .",
    "the matrices are calculated for each of the two - dimensional bins in laboratory momentum and polar angle , with the boundaries of the @xmath47 bins in momentum at ( @xmath48 ) gev/@xmath49 and the boundaries of the 9 bins in @xmath50 at ( @xmath51 @xmath52 ) .    in this analysis ,",
    "the inverted misidentification matrix is applied for each of the identified hadrons by multiplying the respective weights for each hadron being a pion or kaon to obtain the total weight for the di - hadron and any of the four pion - kaon combinations . to confirm the consistency of this treatment , the @xmath53 branching ratios for the pion - pion and kaon - kaon decay channels to the pion - kaon decay channel",
    "are compared to the pdg @xcite values and found to be consistent .",
    "we confirm that the total yield of particle pairs is unaffected by this treatment .",
    "the corrected yields are distributed among the ( @xmath54 ) bins according to the corresponding hadron masses : one identified hadron pair appears in several @xmath11 bins with the above - determined weights , depending on the particular hadron combination .",
    "the ratios relative to the uncorrected hadron assignment are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : beforeafterpid ] , where one can see that the overall corrections are of the order of 20% to 50% .",
    "the uncertainties on the pid matrices are taken into account as uncertainties in the di - hadron yields and propagated through the subsequent corrections . at present , the uncertainties are only assigned individually for each hadron combination , neglecting the correlations between different hadron combinations .",
    "they follow the uncertainties assigned in ref .",
    "@xcite but take into account the additional complication of having two rather than one hadrons to unfold . to obtain the final uncertainties , the asymmetric uncertainties on the inverted pid matrices",
    "are sampled @xmath55 times with a random generator with gaussian distributions around the central value ( separately above and below this value ) . from the resulting yields ,",
    "the 68th percentiles from @xmath55 samples relative to the central values for each ( @xmath56 ) bin are taken as the systematic uncertainties on the pid - corrected di - hadron yields due to the pid matrix evaluation and inversion uncertainties .",
    "the size of the statistical and systematic uncertainties relative to the pid - corrected di - hadron yields is displayed in fig .  [",
    "fig : pidsyst ] for selected hadron combinations .",
    "as expected from the overall size of the yields , the statistical precision is best for opposite - sign pion pairs , followed by pion - kaon and then kaon pairs , with the same - sign precision being generally lower .",
    "the pid systematic uncertainties are mostly smaller than the statistical uncertainties in almost any bin , with the exception of the lowest @xmath11 bins .",
    "the reconstructed fractional momentum @xmath11 of each hadron may have been smeared from its actual value and therefore must be corrected . for this purpose ,",
    "the generic mc simulations are used to create two - dimensional histograms with @xmath57 bins of generated and reconstructed ( @xmath56 ) combinations for each of the two hadrons .",
    "only events that are generated and reconstructed within this range of @xmath11 are considered .",
    "events outside this range are treated in the manner described later in the acceptance correction section .",
    "the two - dimensional response histograms are created for each hadron and charge combination and for all topology assignments .",
    "as the pid correction was already applied to the data before the smearing correction , the true particle - type information in the mc is selected for both generated and reconstructed ( @xmath56 ) . in the smearing matrices , the diagonal elements are dominant for all hadron combinations , as can be expected in such a coarse binning . in the case of the pion - kaon and kaon - kaon combinations , the non - diagonal elements are slightly larger than for the pion - pion case , which indicates that the kaon smearing is slightly larger than that of pions .",
    "the small off - diagonal components facilitate the inversion of the smearing matrix significantly and a simple , analytically inverted matrix should be sufficient to unfold the di - hadron yields",
    ". however , the singular value decomposition ( svd ) unfolding method @xcite is used as our default to properly unfold the statistical uncertainties and assign systematic uncertainties due to the limited mc statistics , especially for bins far from the diagonal .",
    "this also takes into account the possible effects of the different @xmath11 distributions in data and mc , which will be discussed later .    in the svd unfolding , a regularization parameter @xmath58 accounts for the lack of statistics in the smearing matrix entries and the shape of the mc spectra .",
    "if @xmath58 is not selected properly , the unfolded yields can be either too biased by the mc spectrum ( too small a value for @xmath58 ) or can exhibit large fluctuations ( too large a value for @xmath58 ) . following the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , the best regularization parameter is chosen when the index of the regularized vector becomes smaller than unity . initially , the fluctuations observed in the regularization parameter distribution are large , so that the false choice of too - small @xmath58 values leads to spurious discrepancies at very high @xmath11 between distributions of the same physics content that were consistent before unfolding . after smoothing the @xmath58 distributions ,",
    "the expected behavior is markedly better ( _ i.e. , _ a relevant exponentially falling contribution and an irrelevant flat contribution due to mc statistical fluctuations ) and the selection of the regularization parameter is considered more reliable .",
    "the smearing is corrected in all data samples after the pid correction is applied and before the non-@xmath59 events are removed .",
    "the final before / after ratio plots are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : beforeaftersmearing ] as a function of ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "apart from the highest ( @xmath56 ) bins , where the corrections get large , the yield ratios are close to unity .",
    "all uncertainties prior to the smearing - unfolding ( pid and statistical uncertainties ) are unfolded as well , resulting in the respective covariance matrices .",
    "the covariance matrix due to the mc statistics itself and the differences with an analytic unfolding ( _ i.e. , _ application of the inverted response matrix ) are assigned as systematic uncertainties related to the unfolding .      various qed processes can produce hadronic final states that contribute to our di - hadron yields and must be removed .",
    "apart from particle misidentification , which has been addressed already , @xmath60 and bhabha scattering processes can not contribute to hadronic final states , as has been verified in mc simulations .",
    "the processes that do produce hadron pairs are either qed processes having partons created initially , such as two - photon processes @xmath61 and @xmath62 , or via decays such as from @xmath63 .",
    "hadrons from these processes are not produced directly via @xmath64 and hence should not be included in our extracted di - hadron cross sections .",
    "similarly , resonant @xmath2 production and subsequent decays into neutral or charged @xmath31 meson pairs create pion and kaon pairs that must be removed ( the non - resonant @xmath65 process does not contribute @xcite ) .",
    "the direct production of quark - antiquark pairs in electron - positron annihilation @xmath66 and @xmath67 is treated as signal in this section , while weak decays in these continuum processes will be treated later .",
    "figure [ fig : zqedcontpid0_mix4 ] shows the relative fractions of all these processes for selected hadron pairs in the _ any _ di - hadron topology . due to the large branching fraction of the single - prong @xmath32 decay for at least one of the @xmath32 leptons , @xmath32 processes are the dominant background for pions from small to especially large fractional energies where the single hadron inherits a large fraction of the @xmath32 momentum .",
    "the other non-@xmath59 processes generally play a minor role with contributions less than a few percent , with the exception at high @xmath11 where the two - photon process @xmath68 contributes several percent to pion pairs .",
    "resonant @xmath2 production either in charged or neutral ( @xmath69-mixed ) @xmath31 meson decays contributes a few to about 10% and it vanishes when one fractional energy approaches 0.5 due to the additional decays needed to produce pions and kaons .",
    "the distributions for other di - pion topologies are similar except that the additional thrust requirement removes nearly all @xmath2 decays . for same - sign di - pions , the @xmath32 contribution is substantially smaller as the single - prong decays of oppositely charged @xmath32 create predominantly oppositely - charged pions . for _ same_-hemisphere di - pions , the single - prong @xmath32 decays can not contribute and consequently the relative @xmath32 contributions are below 10 - 20% everywhere .    for kaon - related di - hadron combinations , the overall non-@xmath59 contributions are as small as for di - pions , but @xmath70 and @xmath71 are more important .",
    "in addition , the @xmath32 decays do not play a substantial role due to the suppressed kaonic decays .",
    "charm decays generally produce more ckm - favored @xcite kaons than ckm - suppressed pions .",
    "this results in a generally larger fraction of charm events contributing to the pion - kaon and kaon - kaon cross sections : up to 60% for kaon pairs at the lowest @xmath11 , with a similar fall - off as for pion pairs .",
    "similarly , @xmath72 decays favor kaons over pions and thus their fractions are as high as 20% ( summed ) , rapidly disappearing at higher @xmath11 .        assuming that the non-@xmath59 and @xmath73 mc reliably describe the data , the background contributions are directly subtracted from the data distributions .",
    "in this way , we avoid introducing further uncertainties due to the shape of the @xmath74 mc .",
    "as all these processes are qed and @xmath2 processes , they are very well understood at the theory level .",
    "the yield uncertainty is 1.4% for the @xmath75 process @xcite but is substantially larger for the two - photon processes due to associated production , which is not taken into account in the current two - photon simulations .",
    "a factor of four relative to the nominal yield has been assumed for the latter @xcite .",
    "for the systematic uncertainties due to the non-@xmath59 background correction , these overall uncertainties as well as the statistical uncertainties in the non-@xmath59 mc , are taken into account .",
    "the preselection and acceptance correction is divided into three separate terms , motivated by the different sources of corrections and to better expose their individual effects .",
    "the first takes into account the effect on the reconstruction within the specified acceptance selection , mostly due to the preselection criteria and decays in flight ; the second treats the losses outside the barrel acceptance ; and the third takes into account potential losses as @xmath76 approaches unity , which are not properly described in the generic mc .",
    "the first correction incorporates generated hadron pairs within the barrel geometry that do not get reconstructed . as particle identification ,",
    "non-@xmath59 removal and smearing have already been applied , the reconstructed events are considered based on the generic reconstructed @xmath74 mc information , but taking the mc - truth particle type and momenta instead of the reconstructed values .",
    "the correction factor is calculated as the ratio of reconstructed to generated events per ( @xmath56 ) bin for each hemisphere assignments , hadron types , and charge combinations .",
    "this correction takes also into account the events that were initially smeared out of or into the @xmath11 range considered for this analysis .",
    "the efficiencies are relatively flat at around 70% and only drop substantially at higher @xmath11 .",
    "this is similar to the behavior noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was found to be mostly due to the preselection criteria , especially the heavy jet mass restriction that disfavors high-@xmath11 events where the hadrons naturally have to be more aligned with the thrust axis as little other energy remains . also , the minimum track requirement of three disfavors very high @xmath11 hadron pairs , where for the same reason the multiplicity is small .      a certain fraction of di - hadrons are not reconstructed because at least one of the hadrons is outside of the barrel acceptance .",
    "this fraction is evaluated by comparing the generated mc within the barrel acceptance ( _ i.e. , _ including the acceptance selection criteria ) with the generated mc without the acceptance requirement .",
    "this acceptance fraction is around 70% and rather flat as a function of ( @xmath56 ) , increasing slightly at very high fractional energies .",
    "the only systematic uncertainties related to these acceptance corrections ( both within and outside the barrel region ) originate from the statistical uncertainty of the fractions within the acceptance .",
    "these uncertainties are rather moderate in comparison to all other systematic and statistical uncertainties that are aggregated in section [ sec : syst ] .",
    "the generated mc does not necessarily reproduce the hadron distributions well for very forward or backward polar angles in the cms .",
    "ideally , the hadron polar angular distributions should resemble those of the initially produced quark - antiquark pairs and thus follow a @xmath77 dependence , neglecting the small linear dependence due to @xmath78 interference .",
    "the lower the fractional energy , the less pronounced this behavior : this is due to the additional smearing by the transverse momentum generated in the fragmentation process .",
    "while such a behavior is roughly visible at smaller polar angles , the distributions rapidly drop off at higher polar angles as if some remaining acceptance cut is still present . as a consequence , the previous acceptance and efficiency corrections are not complete and need to be further corrected for this effect . as the dependence at smaller polar angles",
    "is well described by the expected parabola , this function is used to fit the mc and compare the areas below the fit - result curve and the actual histograms . in principle",
    ", this treatment should be independent for the two hadrons and can be applied by multiplication of the two individual correction factors .",
    "an expected increase of the correction with increasing @xmath26 , due to higher-@xmath11 tracks being more collimated and thus closer to the partonic polar angular dependence , has been confirmed .",
    "the overall effect of this last acceptance correction is on the order of a few percent .",
    "the effect of all three acceptance and efficiency corrections is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : acceptance ] , where the ratios of the di - hadron yields before and after the corrections are displayed .",
    "the overall effect amounts to between two times the initial yields at moderate ( @xmath56 ) and more than ten times at very high @xmath11 ( where the event preselection correction dominates ) .",
    "generally , fragmentation functions are only defined for hadrons produced by qcd processes and decays and so any weak decays should be removed . in practice",
    "this is only possible if at all with the help of mc and not entirely reliable .",
    "therefore , many fragmentation results do not exclude weak decays or only those experimentally detectable such as those of @xmath45 baryons and neutral kaons .",
    "the approach taken here is to provide results that either contain all weak decays or completely remove them with the help of mc .",
    "every @xmath67 event undergoes at least one weak decay to produce a pion or kaon .",
    "however , in the fragmentation process , various quark - antiquark pairs are created and consequently pions and kaons can be created that did not originate directly from the decays of charmed hadrons . the only way to separate them is by following the parents of each final state hadron in the mc to either a gluonic string , which corresponds to the absence of a weak decay , or a hadron with a different , non - light valence flavor . in the latter case ,",
    "a weak decay was present and this hadron would have to be removed .",
    "the difficulty is rapidly ( algorithmically ) determining this information for a given hadron type . in the di - hadron analysis",
    ", it can be argued that the chance of at least one of the two hadrons being from a weak decay is much higher for charm events and that removing all charm events is a valid approximation .",
    "however , this needs to be tested .",
    "the mc history of each hadron is studied to find weak decays .",
    "the heaviest flavor of each particle in the decay chain is selected and compared to the mother particles .",
    "if the decay chain ends at a string without a change in its heaviest flavor , no weak decay is present .",
    "if the flavor does change , a few strong decays need to be vetoed before asserting the presence of a weak decay .",
    "examples are various vector mesons and other excited states with nonzero strangeness where the strangeness is retained in a lower mass state , such as @xmath79 . also ,",
    "various @xmath80 and @xmath67 resonances need to be excluded as they also decay strongly despite the zweig rule @xcite .    the overall weak- and strong - decay fractions as a function of ( @xmath56 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zweakratiop_mix4 ] for the main particle combinations within the _ any _ topology .",
    "similar results are obtained for the other two topologies .",
    "it should be noted that the assumption of charm events creating only weak - decay pions and kaons is almost fulfilled in the procedure mentioned above but that a small fraction of charm di - hadron events nevertheless originates in strong decays .",
    "overall , the fraction of strong decays dominates in all ( @xmath56 ) bins for pion pairs , while the higher fraction of charm events results in larger weak fractions for pion - kaon and is even more pronounced in kaon - kaon combinations . in all cases , the weak fractions drop with @xmath11 as the additional decays",
    "soften the spectrum .",
    "these strong / weak fractions are model - dependent statements as the fragmentation process is only approximated in pythia .",
    "furthermore , the absolute size of weak decays within pythia depends also on the fragmentation settings .",
    "the uncertainties due to these effects are evaluated by comparing the generic belle mc to the pythia default settings in the mc .",
    "the strong fractions for the pythia default mc are given in the plots as well for comparison .",
    "as can be seen , they are rather similar but are generally slightly lower at high @xmath11 where the generally harder spectra in the default pythia settings allow for slightly more weak decays to be present .",
    "the differences are assigned as a systematic uncertainty for the cross sections that have the weak processes removed .",
    "initial - state radiation reduces the cms energy of the produced quark - antiquark pair .",
    "consequently , the fractional energies calculated relative to the nominal cms energy are not correct .",
    "this can alter the shape of the actual @xmath11 dependence of the fragmentation functions and also invalidates pqcd calculations evaluated at the nominal cms energy .",
    "the correction procedure relies on the strategy applied in ref .",
    "@xcite for the single - hadron cross sections .",
    "the events are classified according to their difference from the nominal cms energy ; the events with a cms energy below 99.5% of the nominal energy are removed .",
    "ideally , one would want to observe the initial - state radiation directly in the reconstructed data ; however , most photons are in the very forward and backward regions , outside the belle acceptance .",
    "instead , generated mc data are used to directly identify isr photons and remove their energies from the total cms energy . in the mc , the isr photons are identified by having their mother particles be an initial - state lepton .",
    "the fraction of such events depends on the fractional energies of the two final - state hadrons .",
    "if a large amount of the energy is removed by the photons from the produced quark - antiquark system , very high fractional energies with respect to the nominal @xmath81 are inaccessible .",
    "therefore the fraction of non - isr events ( _ i.e. , _ less than 0.5% cms energy loss ) increases with increasing fractional energies .",
    "this is indeed the case as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : isrzfraction_pid0_mix4 ] for the _ any _ topology hadron pairs ( and similarly for the other two topologies ) .",
    "the events are then corrected by this fraction to obtain the isr - free differential cross sections at the nominal center - of - mass energy . since the isr fraction depends on the fractional energies of the hadrons , the ( @xmath56 ) distribution shape of the mc simulation enters in the isr correction . to address the dependence of the isr correction on the shape in the mc",

    "same - sign kaon pairs have the lowest cross sections in general , with the relative differences from the other combinations increasing at increasing @xmath11 .",

    "as several of the uncertainties are common to all charge and hadron combinations , these cancel in ratios and the information about favored and disfavored fragmentation should be more reliable .",
    "for example , ignoring strange - quark fragmentation to pions , the same - sign to opposite - sign pion - pair ratios are simple measures of disfavored _ vs. _ favored pion fragmentation functions for light quarks . as can be seen in the ratios in fig .",
    "[ fig : allratio_pid15_mix16_c8 ] , they show a similar nearly flat behavior at low fractional energies , but deviate substantially from this trend at higher fractional energies .",
    "generally , the opposite - sign pion - kaon and kaon - kaon ratios are more suppressed than the already disfavored same - sign pion pairs , but at the highest ( @xmath56 ) do become comparable . this might be related to the fact that opposite - sign kaons can be favored fragmentation for both hadrons if a @xmath80 was created initially . as the opposite - sign pion - kaon pairs are similar in magnitude , even at high @xmath11 , it can be argued that disfavored fragmentation from strange quarks to pions is not as suppressed .",
    "same - sign kaon pairs , where at least one strange - quark pair needs to be produced in the fragmentation , are always suppressed at least one order of magnitude relative to the opposite - sign pion pairs .",
    "this shows that strangeness produced in fragmentation is indeed strongly suppressed , as is generally assumed in fragmentation models such as those included in pythia .",
    "figure [ fig : xsecs ] displays all six relevant hadron combinations for _ opposite _ hemispheres while fig .  [",
    "fig : xsecs2 ] shows the cross sections for hadrons within the _ same _ hemisphere using a thrust requirement of @xmath36 .",
    "note that the requirement of a minimum thrust value is not corrected for in these hemisphere decompositions , which must be taken into account when used for global ff analyses .",
    "as expected , the cross sections at small @xmath11 are of similar magnitude between the _ same _ and _ opposite _ hemispheres , while at higher @xmath11 only _ opposite_-hemisphere pairs remain .",

    "this is in agreement with the assumption of the _ same _ hemisphere di - hadrons emerging predominantly from the common initial parton .",
    "if so , the sum of the two hadron s fractional energies can not exceed unity and they do indeed drop to zero at ( @xmath56 ) each around 0.5 .",
    "the small difference between the sum of the _ same _ and _ opposite _ hemispheres and the _ any _ topology assignment at low @xmath11 is due to the additional thrust selection used to identify hemispheres .",

    "<S> strange and charm fragmentation dilute this simple relation for pions but in a global analysis all yields and all flavors can be treated appropriately . </S>",
    "<S> this general idea has been formulated in the context of the collins fragmentation function measurements in @xmath15 and applied there @xcite but has already been considered much earlier in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in the case that two hadrons are detected in the same hemisphere </S>",
    "<S> , their production is more likely to arise from the same parton so that di - hadron fragmentation functions ( diff ) should describe their yields theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism for diffs was developed initially in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and including dglap evolution @xcite as summarized in ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their polarized counterparts , sometimes denoted as interference fragmentation functions , have been widely used in sidis experiments @xcite and belle @xcite to access together the quark transverse - spin distribution in the nucleon @xcite . in this paper , the individual @xmath11 dependence of the unpolarized baseline diffs is extracted .    it should be noted that the leading - order mapping of single versus di - hadron fragmentation to the opposite versus same hemisphere assignments fails at next - to - leading order , where both types of fragmentation must be considered simultaneously @xcite . due to energy conservation , the momentum of the same - hemisphere di - hadrons should not exceed the total initial momentum of the parton if originating from one parton only .    the inclusive cross sections for charged di - hadrons in various topologies as a function of their fractional energies @xmath25 and @xmath26 are extracted in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> to evaluate the role of favored and disfavored fragmentation , the ratios between these cross sections for various charge and hadron type combinations are calculated as well . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions for different topologies are compared to better understand single versus di - hadron fragmentation . finally , the cross sections are compared to various monte carlo ( mc ) simulation tunes optimized for different collision systems and energies .    </S>",
    "<S> since the corrections are rather similar , a modified version of the di - hadron analysis code is used to extract single - hadron results as a comparison and cross check to the previously published single - hadron cross sections @xcite . as a new result , </S>",
    "<S> the previously unpublished single - proton cross sections as a function of @xmath11 are presented here and compared to the aforementioned mc tunes .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper is organized as follows : after a short description of the detector in section i , the raw di - hadron measurement is described in section ii before detailing the various corrections necessary to arrive at the final cross sections , their ratios as well as topology dependence . the single - hadron analysis , including the new single - proton results , are presented and compared to mc tunes in section iii . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with a summary in section iv . </S>"
