    "the puzzle about the origin of pulsation instability in the b - type main sequence stars had persisted for many years .",

    "1992 , seaton 1993 ) .",
    "these new opacities revealed the metal opacity bump around @xmath13 k , which is called the @xmath12 or fe@xmath14bump , because transitions within the iron m - shell dominate .",
    "since then , many intriguing results have been obtained for the b - type pulsators , mainly thanks to data from the multi - site photometric and spectroscopic campaigns organized for several of such objects as well as from the space - based missions like most @xcite , corot @xcite or kepler @xcite .",
    "one of the most important results was the discovery of high - order g - modes in early b - type pulsators in which typically low order p / g modes are observed .",
    "these variables were termed the @xmath0 cep / spb stars or hybrid pulsators and a few of them were detected up to now , e.g. , @xmath15 eridani ( handler et al .",

    "moreover , the solar chemical mixture has been redetermined several times ( grevesse & noels 1993 , grevesse & sauval 1998 , asplund et al .",
    "2005 , 2009 ) .",
    "despite of that , still a common problem is to get the high - order g - modes excited in models with masses larger than about 7 @xmath17 .",
    "the hybrid pulsators give challenges as well as possibilities .",
    "excitation of both low order p / g modes and high order g - modes allow potentially to scan almost the whole interior of a star . on the other hand",
    ", the problem with instability of high - order g - modes indicates that there is still something we do not understand or can not adequately take into account in stellar physics .",
    "usually , the opacity data are , , blamed  for the inconsistencies and an artificial increase of the opacity coefficient was called , e.g. , for the @xmath15 eri star ( pamyatnykh , handler & dziembowski 2004 ) .    in this paper",
    "we reanalyse the frequency spectrum of the hybrid b - type pulsator 12 lacertae . in section2 , we give an overview of the star .",

    "conclusions are summarised in section5 .",
    "12 lacertae ( dd lac , hr 8640 , hd 214993 ) is a well - known pulsating star of b2iii spectral type .",
    "studies of the variability of the star have begun in the early twentieth century when @xcite discovered its radial velocity variations .",
    "the period of these changes amounted to @xmath19 as determined by @xcite .    in the following years 12",
    "lac had been extensively studied by many authors , e.g.@xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the physical interpretation of the radial velocity changes was incorrect ; they thought that 12 lac is a binary system . @xcite and",
    "@xcite reported the light variations with periods of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively , which agreed well with the spectroscopic value of @xcite .",
    "@xcite explained a shape of the light curve as an interference between two close periods of the order of @xmath20 . in his further studies , @xcite found three periods ; the well - known primary @xmath22 , the secondary @xmath23 and the third @xmath24 .",
    "however , these periods have not been confirmed by @xcite , who determined the new value of the primary period @xmath25 and found the secondary @xmath26 . in 1956 , one of the first worldwide observing campaigns was organized called the international lacertae weeks @xcite .",
    "the analysis of these observations by @xcite led to a discovery of four different periods ; two already known : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and two new ones : @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite chose a more homogeneous sample of yellow passband data from this campaign and detected six periods : p@xmath31 , p@xmath32 , p@xmath33 , p@xmath34 , p@xmath35 and p@xmath36 .",
    "sato ( 1979 ) examined observational data of 12 lac to test stability of pulsational periods .",
    "next , secular variations of the period were searched by ciurla ( 1987 ) , but no variations larger than 0.08 s per century were found . after the great effort made during the international lacertae weeks more photometric data were gathered and analysed by jarzebowski et al .",
    "( 1979 ) and jerzykiewicz et al .",
    "smith ( 1980 ) examined siiii @xmath37 4567 line profile variations .",
    "his findings were generally in agreement with previous results of jerzykiewicz ( 1978 ) .",
    "the spectroscopic analysis based on high spectral and time resolution observations had been carried out by mathias et al .",
    "their frequency analysis revealed a presence of 6 photometric frequencies in the radial velocity curve .",
    "subsequently @xcite investigated the possibility of existence of the equidistant triplet , @xmath2 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ( corresponding to periods p@xmath6 , p@xmath40 and p@xmath41 ) and performed seismic modelling .    in the years 2003 - 2004 , the two multisite campaigns for 12 lac were organized .",
    "@xcite reported results on the photometric campaign ; they confirmed five from six already known frequencies and added six new independent modes , including the low frequency typical for slowly pulsating b - type stars ( spb ) .",
    "the frequency values determined from these data are : @xmath2=5.179034 , @xmath42=5.066346 , @xmath39=5.490167 , @xmath38=5.334357 , @xmath43=4.24062 , @xmath44=7.40705 , @xmath45=5.30912 , @xmath46=5.2162 , @xmath47=6.7023 , @xmath48=5.8341 and @xmath49=0.35529 c / d . based on the colour",
    "photometry @xcite provided the spherical degrees @xmath1 for the five strongest frequency peaks and constraints on @xmath1 for the low - amplitude frequencies . then , @xcite presented results on the spectroscopic campaign .",
    "they confirmed 10 independent frequencies discovered from photometry .",
    "the important result was that in their spectroscopy the spb - type frequency has been also detected .",
    "thus , 12 lac is another known hybrid pulsator in which the @xmath0 cep and spb type modes are excited simultaneously . from spectroscopy",
    ", @xcite arrived at a unique identification of the mode degrees , @xmath1 , and azimuthal orders , @xmath50 , for four pulsational frequencies .",
    "dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2008 ) , based on results from the 2003 world - wide campaign , made seismic modelling of 12 lac and showed that the rotation rate increases significantly towards the star centre .",
    "they addressed also a problem with excitation of low frequency mode @xmath4 .",
    "0.010 , 0.015 , the hydrogen abundance of @xmath51 , initial rotational velocity of @xmath52 km / s , no overshooting from the convective core and the opal tables .",
    "lines labeled as @xmath53 , @xmath54 and an asterisk will be discussed latter in the text . ]    in fig.[hr ] , we show the observational error box of 12 lac in the hr diagram .",
    "the star is in an advanced phase of the core hydrogen burning .",
    "we adopted the effective temperature , @xmath55 and luminosity , @xmath56 from @xcite . in the literature various determinations of metallicity",
    "are given .",
    "niemczura & daszyska - daszkiewicz ( 2005 ) obtained [ m / h]@xmath57 from the ultraviolet iue spectra , which corresponds to @xmath58 , whereas @xcite derived @xmath59 from the high resolution optical spectra .",
    "therefore , we show evolutionary tracks for two values of metallicity : @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "computations were performed using the warsaw - new jersey evolutionary code ( pamyatnykh et al .",
    "1998 ) , with the opal equation of state @xcite , the opal opacity tables @xcite and the latest heavy element mixture by @xcite , hereafter agss09 . for lower temperatures ,",
    "the opacity data were supplemented with the ferguson tables @xcite .",
    "we assumed the hydrogen abundance of @xmath51 , initial rotational velocity of @xmath62 km / s and no overshooting from the convective core .",
    "rotational velocity was chosen of the same magnitude as in @xcite who derived @xmath63 km / s and @xmath64 km / s .",
    "it means that 12 lac rotates at a speed of about 10% of its break - up velocity ( @xmath65 km / s ) .",
    "to identify pulsational modes detected in 12 lac , we will use the most popular observables , i.e. , the amplitudes and phases of the photometric and radial velocity variations . here , we rely on the strmgren @xmath66 photometry @xcite and the radial velocity changes @xcite determined as the first moment of the siiii 4552.6  line .",
    "we performed mode identification in two steps .",
    "firstly , we determined the degree @xmath1 ignoring all effects of rotation on pulsation .",
    "this is a commonly used approach and in the case of 12 lac , which rotates at a speed of about 50 km / s , seems to be justified for the most frequencies .",
    "however , this value of rotation can already couple pulsational modes and affects properties of slow modes such as the frequency @xmath49 detected in 12 lac .",
    "therefore , in the second step , we checked whether the dominant frequency , @xmath2 , can be a rotational coupled mode and apply traditional approximation to identify the angular numbers of the low frequency , @xmath49 .      if all effects of rotation on stellar pulsation are neglected then identification of the mode degree , @xmath1 , from photometric amplitudes and phases are independent of the inclination angle , @xmath67 , intrinsic mode amplitude , @xmath68 , and azimuthal order , @xmath50 .",
    "this is also a disadvantage of disregarding rotation because the full geometry of mode can not be determined .",
    "within the zero - rotation approximation , the complex amplitude of the light variation in the @xmath69 passband in the framework of linear theory can be written as ( e.g. , daszyska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "2002 ) @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the spherical harmonic , @xmath72 is disc averaging factor , and @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the temperature , geometrical and pressure effects , respectively .",
    "expressions for these quantities can be found in daszyska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the radial velocity variations due to pulsations are defined as the first moment of the well isolated spectral line and the formulae is given in dziembowski ( 1977 ) .    to compute the theoretical values of the photometric amplitudes and phases",
    "two inputs are needed .",
    "the first one comes from models of stellar atmospheres and these are passband flux derivatives over effective temperature and gravity as well as limb darkening , included in the terms @xmath73 and @xmath75 , respectively . here",
    ", we rely on two grids of stellar atmosphere models : lte @xcite and non - lte @xcite and consider different values of the atmospheric metallicity , [ m / h ] , and the microturbulent velocity , @xmath76 .",
    "the second input is connected with pulsational properties and this is the so - called nonadiabatic complex parameter @xmath8 describing a ratio of the amplitude of the radiative flux perturbation to the radial displacement at the photosphere level ( e.g. daszyska - daszkiewicz , dziembowski , pamyatnykh 2003).the @xmath8-parameter is incorporated in the temperature term , @xmath73 .    a comprehensive overview of possible sources of uncertainties in the theoretical values of the photometric amplitudes and phases of early b - type pulsators has been studied in details by @xcite .    the value of @xmath8 for a given mode can be either obtained from the linear nonadiabatic computations of stellar pulsations ( cugier , dziembowski , pamyatnykh 1994 ) or determined from observations ( daszyska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) . here",
    ", we applied the two approaches .    to identify the degree @xmath1 of pulsational modes of 12 lac using the theoretical @xmath8-parameter",
    ", we compared the theoretical and observational values of the photometric amplitude ratios and phase differences in various pairs of passbands . to this aim , we considered models from the error box corresponding to masses from 10 to @xmath77 and used the nonadiabatic pulsational code of dziembowski ( 1977 ) . to check how our identification of @xmath1 is robust we considered two values of metallicity , @xmath60 and 0.010 , two chemical mixtures , agss09 and gn93 ( @xcite ) , two sources of the opacity tables , opal @xcite and op @xcite , and two sets of stellar model atmospheres , lte and non - lte .",
    "the hydrogen abundance was fixed at @xmath51 and no overshooting from the convective core was allowed .",
    "we considered the values of @xmath1 from 0 up to 6 and the frequency range appropriate to the observational values .    using the theoretical values of @xmath8 , we arrived at the following identification .",
    "the dominant mode @xmath2 as well as @xmath42 are certainly dipoles ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "identification of @xmath1 for @xmath39 and @xmath43 is also unique ; they are quadruple modes ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "there is also no doubt about identification of @xmath1 for @xmath38 ; certainly this is a radial mode ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "identification of @xmath1 for the remaining frequencies is ambiguous : @xmath44 is most likely a dipole , but it may be also @xmath78 or 3 ; @xmath45 can be @xmath80 ; for @xmath46 we were not able to associate any values of @xmath1 ; @xmath47 is either @xmath81 or 1 and @xmath48 can be @xmath3 or 2 or 3 .",
    "finally for the spb like mode , @xmath49 , we got @xmath3 or 6 , but because of the strong averaging effects which increase with the harmonic degree , the @xmath82 identification is much less probable .",
    "these identifications are independent of the metallicity , opacity data , mixture and atmosphere models .",
    "an influence of the different stellar parameters ( within the error box ) is also negligible .",
    ".the most probable identification of @xmath1 for the 12 lac frequencies obtained from two methods described in the text . in the last column , we put the values of @xmath50 determined by desmet et al.(2009 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab_f ]    the last issue we would like to examine is the effect of the opacity enhancement .",
    "the reason is that for 12 lac , as well as for some other @xmath0 cephei stars , there was postulated an increase of stellar opacities near the @xmath83-bump @xcite .",
    "this should have solved the problem with instability of some modes as well as improve fitting frequencies .",
    "we decided to test the artificial opacity enhancement near this opacity bump .",
    "to this aim , we increased the opacity coefficient in the opal tables by 50% in the metal bump .",
    "the obtained seismic models fitting two frequencies , @xmath38 and @xmath42 , were not changed much .",
    "the masses , effective temperatures and luminosities were similar . as one could expect , the biggest difference is related to the instability . with higher opacities ,",
    "all our models have unstable modes @xmath79 , p@xmath6 and @xmath3 , g@xmath6 , even for @xmath84 . it turned out , that models calculated with the modified opal table mimic those computed with the original op data .",
    "it is connected with the internal differences between the two opacity tables ; the op data provide larger opacity coefficient near the @xmath83-bump .",
    "however , with the modified opacities we did not manage to find models fitting the empirical values of the @xmath8-parameter , neither for @xmath38 nor for @xmath42 .",
    "the increase of the opacity coefficient changed significantly the real part @xmath8 whereas the imaginary part of @xmath8 was almost insensitive to the opacity increase .",
    "although the increase of the opacity parameter can solve problems with instabilities , a disagreement between the empirical and theoretical values of @xmath8 argues against this change .",
    "the same result was obtained for @xmath16 pegasi ( walczak & daszyska - daszkiewicz 2010 , walczak et al .",
    "the aim of the paper was to construct complex seismic models of the @xmath0 cep / spb star 12 lacertae , i.e. , models which fit simultaneously pulsational frequencies and the corresponding values of the nonadiabatic parameter @xmath8 .",
    "as usually , we began with the mode identification from the multi - colour photometry and radial velocity data .",
    "unambiguous determination of @xmath1 was possible for the six frequencies of 12 lac ; for the remaining ones usually two possibilities were obtained . moreover , for the dominant mode , @xmath2 , and the high - order g - mode , @xmath4 , the effects of rotation on identification of @xmath1 were checked . as a result we got that @xmath2 is the pure ( non - rotational coupled ) dipole mode and @xmath4 is the dipole retrograde mode .",
    "we found plenty of models which reproduce the two centroid frequencies @xmath38 and @xmath42 , identified as @xmath79 , p@xmath6 and @xmath3 , g@xmath6 , respectively , and their empirical values of the @xmath8-parameter simultaneously .",
    "these models are inside the observational error box only if the op opacity tables were used .",
    "models computet with the opal data had too small effective temperatures and luminosities .",
    "the next argument for the op tables is that with this data , there exist models which fit additionally the high - order g - mode frequency , @xmath4 , identified as @xmath85 , g@xmath9 , and its values of @xmath8 for quite low values of the core overshooting , @xmath86 . with the opal data such models exist only for @xmath87 .",
    "thus , we managed to find models which reproduce the three frequencies and their @xmath8-parameters simultaneously .",
    "this is the first star for which such a good concordance was achieved .",
    "moreover , we showed that if one assumes the rotational velocity of the order of 75 km / s for the rotational splitting of the gravity and mixed modes , then there exist models fitting the four frequencies and a model which fits the six frequencies ( the first five and the low frequency @xmath4 ) .",
    "this value of the rotational velocity agrees with the result obtained from identification of @xmath1 and @xmath50 for the high - order g - mode frequency @xmath4 .",
    "it confirms also the rotational rate suggested by dziembowski & pamyatnykh ( 2008 ) for the interior of 12 lac .    similarly to the case of the hybrid pulsator @xmath16 pegasi , we got that an increase of opacities in the metal bump spoils an agreement between the empirical and theoretical values of the non - adiabatic parameter @xmath8 .",
    "thus , our conclusion is the same : if modifications of the opacity tables are needed they have to be done in a more detailed way .",
    "we thank gelard handler for providing us with data on the light variations in the @xmath66 passbands and maarten desmet for data on the radial velocity variations .",
    "this work was partially supported by the human capital programme grant financed by the european social fund .",
