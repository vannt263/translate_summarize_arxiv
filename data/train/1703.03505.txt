    "let @xmath3 be a finite - dimensional affine algebraic group defined over a field @xmath4 of characteristic zero",
    ". for any ( discrete ) group @xmath5 , the set of all representations of @xmath5 in @xmath3 has a natural structure of an affine @xmath4-scheme called the _ representation scheme _ @xmath6 .",
    "the representation schemes and associated representation varieties play an important role in many areas of mathematics , most notably in representation theory and low - dimensional topology . in representation theory , the fundamental problem is to understand the structure of representations of @xmath5 in @xmath3 .",
    "one can approach this problem geometrically by studying the natural ( adjoint ) action of the group @xmath3 on the variety @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath7 is algebraically closed and @xmath5 is finitely generated , the equivariant geometry of @xmath8 is closely related to the representation theory of @xmath5 : the equivalence classes of representations of @xmath5 in @xmath3 are in bijection with the @xmath3-orbits in @xmath8 , and the geometry of @xmath3-orbits determines the algebraic structure of representations . this relation has been extensively studied since the late 70s , and the representation varieties have become a standard tool in representation theory of groups ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in topology ,",
    "one is usually interested in global algebro - geometric invariants of spaces defined in terms of representation varieties of fundamental groups .",
    "for example , if @xmath9 is a knot in @xmath10 , many classical invariants of @xmath11 arise from its character variety @xmath12/\\!/g \\,$ ] , which is the ( categorical ) quotient of the representation variety of the fundamental group of the knot complement @xmath13 .",
    "these invariants include , in particular , the alexander polynomial @xmath14 ( in the simplest case when @xmath15 , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the so - called @xmath16-polynomial @xmath17 ( see @xcite ) , the casson invariant @xcite and the famous chern - simons invariant @xcite , all of which are defined for @xmath18 . in fact , for @xmath18 , the entire character variety , or rather its coordinate ring @xmath19\\ ,   $ ] , has a purely topological interpretation as a kauffman bracket skein module of @xmath20 ( see @xcite ) .    despite being useful tools , the representation varieties exhibit some intrinsic deficiencies .",
    "first of all , these varieties are usually very singular , which makes it hard to understand their geometry .",
    "thus , in representaion theory , one faces the problem of resolving singularities of @xmath8 . in topology",
    ", the use of representation varieties is mostly limited to ( compact orientable ) surfaces , hyperbolic @xmath21-manifolds and knot complements in @xmath10 , all of which are known to be aspherical spaces .",
    "the homotopy type of such a space is completely determined by the isomorphism type of its fundamental group , which makes representation varieties of these groups very strong and efficient invariants . for more general spaces",
    ", however , one needs to take into account a higher homotopy information , and looking at representation varieties of fundamental groups ( or even , higher homotopy groups ) is not enough .",
    "a natural way to remedy these problems is to replace the representation functor @xmath22 with its ( non - abelian ) derived functor @xmath23 much in the same way as one replaces non - exact ( additive ) functors in classical homological algebra ( such as ` @xmath24 ' and ` @xmath25 ' ) with corresponding derived functors ( ` @xmath26 ' and ` @xmath27 ' ) .",
    "geometrically , passing from the representation scheme @xmath8 to the derived representation scheme @xmath28 amounts to desingularizing @xmath8 , while topologically , this brings in a new homology theory of spaces that captures a good deal of homotopy information and refines the classical representation varieties of fundamental groups in an interesting and non - trivial way .",
    "to explain this idea in more precise terms , we recall that the representation scheme @xmath8 is defined as the functor on the category of commutative @xmath4-algebras : @xmath29 assigning to a @xmath4-algebra @xmath16 the set of families of representations of @xmath30 in @xmath3 parametrized by the @xmath4-scheme @xmath31 .",
    "it is well known ( and easy to prove ) that the functor is representable , and we denote the corresponding commutative algebra by @xmath32 may be thought of as the coordinate ring of the affine @xmath4-scheme @xmath8 , and we sometimes write @xmath33 $ ] to emphasize this interpretation . ] .",
    "varying @xmath5 ( while keeping @xmath34 fixed ) , we can now regard @xmath35 as a functor on the category of groups : @xmath36 which we call the _ representation functor _ in @xmath34 .",
    "the functor extends naturally to the category @xmath37 of simplicial groups , taking values in the category @xmath38 of simplicial commutative algebras . both categories",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 carry standard ( simplicial ) model structures , with weak equivalences being the weak homotopy equivalences of the underlying simplicial sets .",
    "the functor @xmath39 is not homotopy invariant : in general , it does not preserve weak equivalences and hence does not descend to a functor between the homotopy categories @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "however , it is easy to check that @xmath42 does map weak equivalences between cofibrant objects in @xmath37 to weak equivalences in @xmath38 ( see lemma  [ sgfun ] ) .",
    "hence , by standard homotopical algebra , it has a ( total ) left derived functor @xmath43 we call the _ derived representation functor _ in @xmath3 .",
    "heuristically , @xmath44 may be thought of as a ",
    "best possible \" universal approximation to the representation functor at the level of homotopy categories . when applied to a simplicial group @xmath5 , the functor",
    "is represented by a simplicial commutative algebra which ( abusing notation ) we denote by @xmath28 .",
    "the homotopy groups of @xmath28 depend only on @xmath5 and @xmath3 , with @xmath45 $ ] being canonically isomorphic to @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath5 is a discrete simplicial group , then @xmath45 \\cong \\gamma_g $ ] . extending our terminology from @xcite , we will refer to @xmath47 $ ] as the _ representation homology _ of @xmath5 in @xmath3 and denote it @xmath48 .",
    "we should mention that representation homology of associative and lie algebras was introduced and studied in @xcite .",
    "the idea of deriving the representation functor was motivated by noncommutative geometry , where the representation functor plays an important role ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) .    next , we recall that the model category @xmath37 of simplicial groups is quillen equivalent to the category of reduced simplicial sets , @xmath49 , which is , in turn , quillen equivalent to the category @xmath50 of pointed connected topological spaces .",
    "these classical equivalences are given by two pairs of adjoint functors @xmath51 the construction of which will be briefly reviewed in section  [ klg ] . here",
    ", we only recall that @xmath52 is the kan loop group functor that assigns to a reduced simplicial set @xmath53 a semi - free simplicial group @xmath54 , which is a simplicial model of the based loop space @xmath55 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the functor @xmath52 preserves weak equivalences and hence descends to a functor between the homotopy categories of @xmath56 and @xmath37 . combining @xmath57 with the derived representation functor",

    "the goal of the present paper is threefold .",
    "first , we give an elementary construction of representation homology in terms of classical ( abelian ) homological algebra .",
    "our construction is analogous to pirashvili s construction of higher order hochschild homology , and it provides a natural interpretation of representation homology as functor homology .",
    "this opens the way to efficient computations and places representation homology in one row with other classical invariants such as hochschild and cyclic homology .",
    "second , we construct spectral sequences and natural maps relating representation homology to other homology theories associated with spaces ( including @xmath68 , the higher hochschild homology , the @xmath69-equivariant homology of the free loop space @xmath70 and the stable homology of the automorphism groups of f.g .",
    "free groups @xmath71 ) .",
    "third , we compute representation homology explicitly in a number of interesting cases , including the spheres @xmath72 , suspensions @xmath73 , closed surfaces of arbitrary genus and some classical 3-dimensional spaces , such as the link complements in @xmath74 and the lens spaces @xmath2 .",
    "one of our main results is the comparison theorem that expresses the representation homology of a simply - connected topological space of finite rational type in terms of its quillen and sullivan models .",
    "we now proceed with a summary of the main results of the paper .",
    "we begin by recalling pirashvili s definition of higher hochschild homology @xcite .",
    "let @xmath75 denote the full subcategory of finite sets with objects @xmath76 ( for @xmath77 ) and @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath79 is the category of @xmath4-vector spaces , any functor @xmath80 with values in @xmath79 extends naturally to a functor @xmath81 on the category of all sets ( by taking the left kan extension along the inclusion @xmath82 ) .",
    "now , given @xmath80 and any simplicial set @xmath83 , we can define a simplicial @xmath4-vector space @xmath84 by composition @xmath85 following @xcite , we denote the homotopy groups of @xmath84 by @xmath86\\,$ ] , where @xmath87 stands for the dold - kan normalization functor .",
    "any commutative @xmath4-algebra @xmath16 defines a functor @xmath88 by assigning to an object @xmath89 the @xmath90-th tensor power @xmath91 and to a morphism @xmath92 the linear map @xmath93 , @xmath94 , with @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "the _ higher hochschild homology _ of @xmath60 with coefficients in @xmath16 is then defined by the formula @xmath97 . as observed in @xcite ,",
    "if @xmath98 is the ( simplicial ) circle , then @xmath99 coincides with the classical hochschild homology @xmath100 of the commutative algebra @xmath16 .",
    "the key fact behind this construction is that @xmath101 is a prop ( i.e. , a permutative category ) with monoidal structure @xmath102 , and the category of @xmath4-algebras over @xmath103 ( i.e. , the category of strong monoidal functors @xmath104 ) is equivalent ( via @xmath105 ) to the category of commutative @xmath4-algebras .",
    "now , to define representation homology we replace @xmath101 by the category @xmath106 of finitely generated free groups with objects @xmath107 ( for @xmath108 ) and morphisms being the arbitrary group homomorphisms .",
    "it is known that @xmath109 is also a prop with monoidal structure @xmath110 , and the category of @xmath4-algebras over @xmath109 is equivalent to the category of commutative hopf @xmath4-algebras . under this equivalence",
    ", a commutative hopf algebra @xmath111 corresponds to the ( strong monoidal ) functor @xmath112 , @xmath113 , which actually takes its values in the category of commutative algebras . as in the case of sets ,",
    "the functor @xmath114 extends naturally to the category of all ( based ) free groups @xmath115 , whose objects are the free groups @xmath116 given with a prescribed generating set @xmath117 and morphisms are the arbitrary group homomorphisms .    mimicking the pirashvili construction , for a reduced simplicial set @xmath53 and a commutative hopf algebra @xmath118",

    "although its proof is almost immediate , proposition [ iprop1 ] has a number of important implications .",
    "first , we state the following theorem , which is the main result of section  [ section_rephom ] ( see theorem  [ rephomdtp2 ] ) . for any @xmath53",
    ", there is a natural first quadrant spectral sequence @xmath131 converging to the representation homology of @xmath60 .",

    "the `` tor '' itself is the ( abelian ) derived functor of the tensor product @xmath141 between covariant and contravariant @xmath142-valued functors over the ( small ) category @xmath106 .",
    "the spectral sequence is a counterpart of pirashvili s fundamental spectral sequence for higher hochschild homology ( _ cf . _",
    "* theorem  2.4 ) ) ; however , in the case of representation homology it takes a more geometric form .",
    "theorem  [ ithm1 ] has several interesting applications .",
    "for example , if @xmath60 is a @xmath143-space , the spectral sequence degenerates giving an isomorphism ( _ cf .",
    "_ corollary  [ bgamma ] ) @xmath144 , \\o(g))\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath145 $ ] is the group algebra of @xmath5 equipped with the natural ( cocommutative ) hopf algebra structure .",
    "the isomorphism shows that the representation homology of ( discrete ) groups has a natural ` tor ' interpretation , similar to the classical ( connes ) interpretation of the hochschild and cyclic homology ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chap .  6 ) ) .",
    "furthermore , combined with a standard comparison theorem for spectral sequences , theorem  [ ithm1 ] implies that the representation homology @xmath130 is stable under pontryagin equivalences inducing isomorphisms of pontryagin algebras @xmath146 . ] , and hence , if @xmath60 is simply - connected , then @xmath130 is actually a _ rational _ homotopy invariant of @xmath60 ( _ cf .",
    "_ proposition  [ rephomhtpinv ] ) .",
    "next , in section  [ sect5 ] , we show that representation homology is not only analogous to higher hochschild homology but actually related to it in a remarkably simple , geometric way .",

    "therefore , @xmath2104 induces a quasi - isomorphism on colimits . in other words , for any augmentation @xmath2095 , we have a quasi - isomorphism @xmath2105    since @xmath60 is finite , @xmath2083 is a smooth simplicial commutative algebra .",
    "therefore , by lemma [ reedy_smooth_lin](1 ) , the linearization @xmath2106 appearing as the target of the map @xmath2107 represents its derived linearization . by cofibrancy of @xmath2079 and",
    "hence @xmath2078 , the same is true for the domain of this map .",
    "this shows that @xmath2108 is tale , which completes the proof .",
    "the above argument can be modified to show that , in some cases , to compute homotopy colimit , it suffices to resolve a diagram by a reedy smooth diagram . to this end",
    ", we adopt the terminology of @xcite , and say that a category @xmath2063 is _ very small _ if    1 .",
    "@xmath2063 has a finite set of objects and a finite set of morphisms , and 2 .",
    "there exists an integer @xmath380 such that , if @xmath2109{f_1 } \\ , } a_1 { \\ , \\xrightarrow[]{f_2 } \\ , } \\ldots { \\ , \\xrightarrow[]{f_n } \\ , } a_n \\,$ ] is a string of composable morphisms of @xmath2063 with @xmath2110 , then some @xmath2111 is the identity morphism in @xmath2063 .    for any object @xmath2065 in such a category , define its degree as the largest integer @xmath90 such that there exists a string @xmath2109{f_1 } \\ , } a_1 { \\ , \\xrightarrow[]{f_2 } \\ , } \\ldots { \\ , \\xrightarrow[]{f_n } \\ , } a_n = \\alpha \\,$ ] of composable morphisms , with none of the morphisms @xmath2111 being the identity .",
    "then , every non - identity morphism raises degree .",
    "therefore , the category @xmath2063 is a reedy category , with @xmath2112 , and @xmath2113 consisting only of the identity morphisms .",
    "[ reedy_smooth_colim ] let @xmath2063 be a very small category , and let @xmath1044 be an @xmath2063-shaped diagram of simplicial commutative algebras .",
    "suppose that @xmath1044 is reedy smooth , then the canonical map @xmath2114 is an isomorphism in @xmath2028 .",
    "first , we show that both @xmath2115 and the ordinary colimit @xmath2116 are of quasi - finite type .",
    "the fact that @xmath2116 is of quasi - finite type follows from condition ( 3 ) of proposition [ finite_type_equiv ] . to see that @xmath2115 is of quasi - finite type ,",
    "we first construct inductively a cofibrant resolution @xmath2079 of @xmath1044 such that each @xmath2117 is degreewise finitely generated .",
    "then , @xmath2118 is again of quasi - finite type by condition ( 3 ) of proposition [ finite_type_equiv ] .",
    "this allows one to apply proposition [ behrend_prop ] to the map @xmath2119 .",
    "any augmentation @xmath2120 determine a compatible system of augmentations @xmath2121 , which can be further pulled back to a compatible system of augmentations @xmath2122 .",
    "taking linearizations gives a map @xmath2123 the assumption that @xmath2124 is reedy smooth implies ( see lemma [ reedy_smooth_lin ] ) that this map is a termwise quasi - equivalence map of reedy cofibrant @xmath2063-shaped diagram in @xmath2062 .",
    "therefore , @xmath384 induces a quasi - isomorphism on colimits : i.e. , the map @xmath2125 is a quasi - isomorphism . by smoothness of @xmath2116 and cofibrancy of @xmath2126 ,",
    "this map represents a map on derived linearizations as well .",
    "this shows that @xmath2127 is tale , finishing the proof .",
    "suppose we are given a diagram @xmath2128 $ ] of simplicial groups , where @xmath509 is semi - free , and the two arrows are semi - free extensions .",
    "let @xmath1044 be the diagram @xmath2129 $ ] obtained from @xmath2128 $ ] by applying the representation functor .",
    "then we have to show that the canonical map @xmath2114 is an isomorphism in @xmath2028 .",
    "since the weak equivalences in @xmath2017 are preserved under filtered colimits , it suffices to assume that the simplicial groups @xmath2130 and @xmath2131 are of finite type ( _ i.e. , _ they are semi - free with finitely many nondegenerate generators ) . while @xmath1044 is not , in general , reedy cofibrant , it is reedy smooth for any algebraic group @xmath3 .",
    "the result therefore follows from proposition [ reedy_smooth_colim ] .",
