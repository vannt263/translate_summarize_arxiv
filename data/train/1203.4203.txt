    "the _ spitzer space telescope _ has led to tremendous advances in the study of galaxies and their interstellar media .",
    "one particularly fruitful area has been the study of the lower - level purely rotational emission lines of molecular hydrogen .",
    "an interesting example was the detection by @xcite of powerful emission from purely rotational @xmath0 lines in the group - wide shock of the strongly interacting group stephan s quintet ( sq ) .",
    "spectral mapping reveals that the emission is distributed along the whole shock and exceeds the x - ray power by a factor @xmath12 , indicating that @xmath0 line emission is an important cooling process in the post - shock region @xcite .",
    "powerful @xmath0 emission has also been detected in many other environments , including luminous infrared galaxies @xcite , radio galaxies @xcite , agns @xcite , and cool cluster core galaxies @xcite . in another case",
    "@xmath0 is detected in the apparent wake of a bow - shock in the cluster abell 3627 @xcite .",
    "the class of strong molecular hydrogen emission galaxies ( called mohegs ; @xcite ) is defined by the strength of the @xmath0 00 s(0)s(3 ) lines relative to that of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , with mohegs having @xmath13(pah8@xmath3 ) @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the mechanism that powers the @xmath0 emission in mohegs is not fully understood , in part because the emission regions are usually unresolved , but in the radio galaxies is likely to be jet - driven shocks @xcite .",
    "the sq shock is exceptional because it is spatially extended over @xmath630  kpc and associated with a well - studied intergalactic shock , which has led to a clear picture of the heating mechanism as dissipation of the kinetic energy associated with the collision @xcite .",
    "here we report the detection of another system containing strong , resolved @xmath11 emission in the bridge between the interacting galaxies ugc 12914/5 , also known as the `` taffy '' galaxies because of the extended radio emission stretched between the two disks @xcite .",
    "the emission closely resembles that observed in sq , with the h@xmath2 lines featuring prominently in the mid - ir spectrum .",
    "the taffy system is believed to be the result of a nearly head - on collision between two disk galaxies .",
    "the galaxies , ugc 12914 and 12915 , have heliocentric velocities of @xmath15 and @xmath16  km  s@xmath17 respectively , and we adopt a distance of 60  mpc based on a hubble constant of 72  km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 .",
    "the disks are @xmath612  kpc apart and are believed to be separating mainly in the plane of the sky at a velocity of 450  km  s@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this estimate is based on assumed masses and a parabolic orbit , and may be an upper limit since it does not take into account dynamical friction resulting from the overlapping dark matter halos . among the notable features of the system",
    "is the gas - rich bridge , which contains about 25% of the gas in the system @xcite .",
    "the bridge is also host to a significant amount of molecular gas @xcite and cold dust @xcite . a warm dust component is apparently heated by uv radiation from the disks @xcite .",
    "h@xmath18 images reveal that the bridge has little star formation outside of a single large region near ugc 12915 @xcite .",
    "when two galaxy disks collide nearly face - on at high velocity , we expect widespread collisions between diffuse atomic clouds , which have a large covering factor in galaxy disks @xcite . in the collision ,",
    "dense molecular clouds in one galaxy will ram through the more diffuse atomic gas of the second galaxy .",
    "the coupling of the generally smaller molecular clouds to larger areas via magnetic fields will increase the drag on the galaxies , enhancing the interaction .",
    "the net result of these processes is that the atomic gas will be splashed out into the bridge with a range of transverse velocities with values extending up to the relative collision velocity @xcite .",
    "some of this gas will fall promptly back into both disks , and some will be stretched between them .",
    "large molecular clouds will tend to stay close to their parent disks , which partially explains the lack of star formation in the bridge .",
    "the gas splashed into the bridge will also have a broad range of angular momenta , resulting in continuing cloud collisions that produce shocks and turbulence .",
    "this paper is primarily aimed at understanding the distribution and excitation of warm molecular hydrogen in the taffy galaxies and bridge , and is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : obs ] we describe the observations and data reduction . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the mid - ir spectra , estimate the cooling rate , and show how the @xmath0 emission is distributed in the taffy system .",
    "we also determine the properties of the warm @xmath11 . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss possible heating mechanisms for the warm @xmath11 , and compare with the @xmath0 mass inferred from previous co observations .",
    "we briefly summarize our findings in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we obtained spectra of the ugc 12914/5 system from the _ spitzer _ public archives ( program i d : 21 , pi : j. houck ) .",
    "the observations were made with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ; @xcite ) on board the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite on 2005 july 8 and 10 using the short - low ( sl ; 5.214.5  @xmath3 ) , long - low ( ll ; 14.028.0  @xmath3 ) , short - high ( sh ; 9.919.6  @xmath3 ) , and long - high ( lh ; 18.737.2  @xmath3 ) modules .",
    "the positions of the slits for all four modules are shown in figure  [ fig : aor ] .",
    "the aors were designed to target the nuclei and selected regions of the galaxies , not specifically the bridge .",
    "however , we were able to exploit the partially overlapping nature of the low resolution slits to make sparse maps of the region .",
    "the observations were initially processed by _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) pipeline version s18.7.0 .",
    "the starting point of our analysis were the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) frames from the science pipeline .",
    "the bcd frames are a high - level calibrated data product which represent slope - fitted data values in electron  s@xmath17 derived from corrected data .",
    "corrections include saturation , non - linearity , detector droop and stray - light corrections .",
    "bcd frames associated with each target position were coadded and background subtracted using dedicated off observations . in the sl and ll modules",
    "the dedicated off observations were combined with spectral orders far from the galaxies .",
    "rogue pixels , especially common in the lh module due to cosmic - ray activation of pixels , were identified manually by blinking the two nod positions against each other to help distinguish rogue pixels from real data .",
    "the rogue pixels were then replaced by suitable averaged values from adjacent pixels using customized software .",
    "spectra were obtained at two nod positions for each target , with the target placed at the 1/3 and 2/3 positions in the slit .",
    "the cubism software @xcite was used to construct partial spectral maps along the ll slits , allowing extractions from numerous positions within the system , labeled a  u as shown in figure  [ fig : cubism ] .",
    "the extraction regions had angular size @xmath19 .",
    "the sl slits are oriented orthogonally and partially overlap in regions c and j. in both cases , the sl spectra covered about 1/3 of the area of the ll , and were scaled up to compensate for this difference .",
    "this rescaling assumes that the emission is uniform over the aperture , which introduces uncertainty into measurements of the sl lines in these regions .",
    "we therefore use these lines only as a check on our excitation diagrams ( see section  [ sec : exc ] ) .",
    "spectra from the ll and sl slits will be referred to herafter as low - res spectra ( resolving power @xmath20 between 57127 ) .",
    "the high - resolution spectra ( hereafter hi - res with @xmath21 ) were extracted with the ssc software spice , using the point source calibration for the galaxies and extended source calibration for the bridge .",
    "the choice of calibrations involves some uncertainty , since the targets are neither fully resolved point sources nor perfectly uniform extended sources . in the worst case ,",
    "the difference between a point source and extended source extraction ( a wavelength - dependent slit - loss correction factor ) can lead to @xmath640% difference in extracted line fluxes for the lines observed .",
    "line fluxes in each extraction region were measured using the smart software package @xcite . in regions",
    "c and j , the partial overlap with the sl module expanded the wavelength coverage . in these cases",
    "we measured the line fluxes using both smart and pahfit @xcite .",
    "pahfit fits known lines , bands , and dust contiua to a stitched version of the low - res spectra .",
    "similar line fluxes were obtained with both methods ; results are presented in table  [ tab : h2 ] .",
    "we note a slight positive offset in the measured line fluxes in region j by pahfit relative to smart , but the differences are only at the 2@xmath22 level .",
    "the effect is more pronounced in the 28  @xmath3 line .",
    "as we point out in the footnote to table  [ tab : h2 ] , the ll1 spectrum from which this was derived showed some inconsistency in its continuum level compared with ll2 , so this line is uncertain no matter how it is measured .",
    "the hi - res line fluxes were measured by single gaussian fitting using smart .",
    "the lh slit covers an area @xmath23 .",
    "the sh slit covers a smaller area of @xmath24 .",
    "the sh spectra were scaled at each nod position so that the continuum matched between the two modules .",
    "the scaling factors were similar for both nods .",
    "the line fluxes and mean of the scaling factors for the two nods are presented in table  [ tab : h2 ] .",
    "images of the system obtained with the infrared array camera ( irac ; @xcite ) and multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; @xcite ) were available from the _ spitzer _ public archives ( program i d : 21 , pi : j. houck ) .",
    "these data were processed by ssc pipeline version s18.7.0 , and were of sufficient quality that further processing was not required .",
    "photometric measurements were made in each of the ll bridge extraction regions using square apertures with the iraf task polyphot .",
    "the cubism spectral extractions use extended source calibration , so the photometric measurements were not aperture - corrected .",
    "the irac 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0  @xmath3 images were gaussian - convolved to match the resolution of the mips 24  @xmath3 image , which is comparable to the resolution at the @xmath0 s(0 ) 28.22  @xmath3 line . for comparison with the hi - res spectra",
    ", we also measured the images using a set of boxes matched to each of the lh nod positions .",
    "the hi - res spectra of the nuclei and the bridge are shown in figure  [ fig : hi ] .",
    "the strength of the @xmath0 lines is very striking , especially in the bridge , where the 00 s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines are stronger than all other lines except the [ ] 34.82  @xmath3 line .",
    "the s(1 ) line is similarly powerful in the ugc 12914 nucleus .",
    "the @xmath0 line fluxes are presented at the top of table  [ tab : h2 ] , while the fine structure line fluxes are shown in table  [ tab : fine ] .",
    "we will further quantify the strength of the @xmath0 emission in section  [ sec : heating ] .",
    "the low - res spectra show that the emission in the bridge is not confined to the position of the high resolution bridge / arm slit which , as shown in figure  [ fig : aor ] , also includes the ugc 12914 spiral arm .",
    "the @xmath0 s(1 ) line is measured in regions a  s .",
    "the two regions where it could not be measured ( t and u ) are near the southern end of ugc 12914 and lie outside the apparent extent of the bridge , based on the radio contours of @xcite .",
    "spectra from all of the regions are shown in figures  [ fig : lo1 ] and [ fig : lo2 ] .",
    "the red diamonds show the continuum flux densities measured from irac and mips for the same extraction regions .",
    "note that in almost all cases these broadband measurements show good agreement with the spectra , indicating that the relative scaling made between spectral orders was appropriate . in only one case ( region o )",
    "do the irac fluxes disagree with the extracted spectra .",
    "however , since no lines were detected in that position , the discrepancy does not effect our analysis of the @xmath11 .",
    "we now present two alternative ways of demonstrating that the @xmath0 emission , as measured in the low - res spectra , extends between the galaxies in the bridge .",
    "figure  [ fig : xsec ] shows cross sections of the ll1 and ll2 slits which cut through the system along three slices , which we call positions 13 .",
    "the locations of the galaxies at each position are shown in the top panels .",
    "no significant emission was detected at position 4 , so it is not shown .",
    "several important results emerge from the cross - sectional analysis .",
    "first , both the [ ] 33.48@xmath3 and the continuum emission ( measured at wavelengths of 30  @xmath3 and 17.4  @xmath3 ) are concentrated in the galaxies , with little originating in the bridge .",
    "this contrasts with the @xmath0 s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines , which show significant emission between the galaxies , especially at position 2 .",
    "the @xmath0 s(1 ) line is even stronger in the bridge compared to the galaxies , and actually drops significantly just south of ugc 12915 .",
    "the right panels of figure  [ fig : xsec ] show that the emission is much weaker outside of ugc 12914 at position 3 than at position 2 ( see also figures  [ fig : lo1 ] and [ fig : lo2 ] ) , indicating that either the gas density or temperature drops significantly south of a line connecting the nuclei .    the extended nature of the @xmath0 emission in the bridge can also be demonstrated using sparse spectral maps .",
    "although the taffy system was not fully mapped , sufficient long - slit low - res spectra were obtained to allow the construction of sparse ll spectral maps using cubism , which are shown in figure  [ fig : maps ] . to provide the reader with a better visualization of the results , the s(0 ) and s(1 )",
    "data ( color image ) are overlaid with 20  cm radio continuum ( contours ) from @xcite .",
    "we also show these radio contours overlaid on an irac 8.0  @xmath3 image , and sparse maps of the [ ] 18.71@xmath3 and [ ] 34.82@xmath3 lines .",
    "these latter lines are selected because they have wavelengths comparable to the @xmath0 s(1 ) and s(0 ) lines , and so provide a sense of the contamination level in the bridge as a result of emission from the galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : maps ] shows that extended @xmath0 emission is present in the bridge region , similar to the distribution of dust @xcite and co @xcite , though differing from the , which peaks in the bridge @xcite .",
    "the total @xmath0 luminosity ( or equivalently , the @xmath0 line cooling rate ) in various regions of the bridge , and an estimate for the whole bridge , can be calculated from the @xmath0 line fluxes .",
    "since the spatial coverage is more complete for the low - res spectra , we restrict our discussion to those data , which cover the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines only , with the exception of regions c and j.    to determine the total 00 s(0 ) and s(1 ) line luminosity in the bridge , we exclude the regions obviously on the disk of the galaxies ( a , g , h , p , and t ) , and region f ( which contains the star forming knot ) , as well as regions very near the galaxies , where contamination from the disk is likely to be largest ( b and i ) .",
    "this leaves regions c , d , e , j , k , l , m , q , and r as bridge spectra . the total flux from these regions",
    "is @xmath25  w  m@xmath9 , giving a total luminosity of 1.16@xmath26  w over a projected area of 78.5  kpc@xmath27 .",
    "the mean surface brightness is @xmath6@xmath28  w  kpc@xmath9 . )",
    "is @xmath29  w  kpc@xmath9 .",
    "this is lower than the surface brightness seen in region c measured in the low - res spectra . although we do not have a complete explanation for the discrepancy",
    ", the result may indicate that the emission is clumpy on the scale of the lh slit .",
    "we note that surface brightness variations comparable to this difference are seen on the scale of the low - res apertures ( @xmath6@xmath30 ) , which may partly explain the difference . ]    to estimate the total @xmath0 luminosity , we must also estimate the spatial extent of the emission .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0 emission is roughly bounded by the extent of the radio emitting bridge .",
    "we define this area as being bounded by the extent of the radio continuum ( down to a level of 0.1  mjy in the @xcite 20  cm emission map ) assuming reasonable inner edges to the galaxy disks .",
    "this provides a bridge area of 170  kpc@xmath27 , and gives a total bridge @xmath0 luminosity @xmath31  w , assuming the properties of the unobserved bridge are similar to those of the observed component .",
    "in regions c and j where the sl data allows the addition of the s(2 ) and s(3 ) lines , the extra contributions amount to an increase of 28% in the luminosity .",
    "our estimate of the total warm @xmath0 luminosity is thus likely to be a lower limit .",
    "although we do not have full spectral coverage of the whole bridge , we can explore the variation of @xmath0 properties as a function of position in the bridge where we have useful data .",
    "the extraction regions a ",
    "u , defined in figure  [ fig : cubism ] , are generally restricted to the ll module of the irs , and thus cover the only 00 s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines .",
    "as previously discussed , regions c and j also provide information for the s(2 ) and s(3 ) lines at 12.3 and 9.66  @xmath3 .",
    "these measurements are sufficient to allow us to make a preliminary exploration of the excitation properties of the warm @xmath0 across the bridge , subject to several constraints and assumptions discussed below .",
    "we have constructed @xmath0 excitation diagrams for the regions a  u . these diagrams plot the column density @xmath32 of @xmath0 in the upper level of each transition , normalized by its statistical weight , versus the upper level energy @xmath33 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which were derived from the measured fluxes assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) for each position .",
    "since most of the excitation diagrams consist of only two points , corresponding to the 00 s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines , we do not show them here , but rather present in table  [ tab : excipars ] the results for a single - temperature fit through the two points in each region .",
    "these fits provide a baseline measurement , and allow us to explore how the ratio of the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines might vary as a function of position in the system . for regions",
    "n , o , and s only an upper limit was obtained for the s(0 ) line , so no temperature was derived .",
    "no h@xmath2 lines were detected in region u.    the results of this analysis are presented in table  [ tab : excipars ] .",
    "most of the regions in the bridge have temperatures ( represented by the slope in the excitation diagram ) in the range 157175  k , with only two regions ( q and r ) having lower temperatures of 130133  k. the nuclei of both galaxies ( regions g and h ) show a higher temperature .",
    "the ugc 12914 nucleus has a @xmath0 temperature of 195@xmath3412  k , some 30  k warmer than the average bridge region .",
    "the warm @xmath0 surface density derived from these measurements ( also given in table  [ tab : excipars ] ) range from @xmath35  @xmath8  kpc@xmath9 at position f , which contains a star forming knot , to the lowest value of @xmath36  @xmath8  kpc@xmath9 at region m. the mid - bridge regions d , k , and r have similar @xmath0 surface densities of 5.06.6@xmath37  @xmath8  kpc@xmath9 .",
    "we again select regions c , d , e , j , k , l , m , q , and r as representing the bridge .",
    "the mean and median value of the surface density over regions between the galaxies is @xmath38 and @xmath39  @xmath8  kpc@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "based on the cooling rate from the same regions ( see section  [ sec : cool ] ) and an assumed average temperature of 166  k , the average thermal cooling time for this warm mass density is @xmath65000  yr , which is very short compared with the bridge formation time .",
    "summing the observed warm @xmath0 masses over these representative bridge regions ( 78.5  kpc@xmath27 in area ) yields an observed mass of @xmath4  @xmath8 .",
    "we estimate that the total warm @xmath0 mass for the whole bridge area of @xmath40  kpc@xmath27 could be as large as 9(+2/@xmath41)@xmath42  @xmath8 if the entire bridge has similar properties to the observed bridge regions .",
    "the lower limit comes from the extreme assumption that no new @xmath0 is detected in the unobserved area .",
    "we have made several simplifying assumptions in estimating the @xmath0 surface density from these data .",
    "first , we have assumed a thermalized equilibrium value for the ortho - to - para ratio . for temperatures above 300  k ,",
    "this ratio is 3 , but for temperatures in the range 130180  k this value varies from 2.32.8 respectively ( see equation 4 of @xcite ) . under most circumstances",
    "we might expect the lower-@xmath43 transitions to be in equilibrium .",
    "normally , the ortho - to - para ratio would be investigated by looking for systematic differences in the odd and even transitions in the excitation diagram . however , because we have so few points ( in most cases only two ) we must simply assume equilibrium values .",
    "this obviously introduces an unknown uncertainty in the final derived properties of the gas .",
    "deviations from lte would lead to uncertainties in the assumed excitation temperature of the gas and thus the final total column densities . in regions c and j where four lines are detected ( discussed below ) we do not see any obvious deviations in the odd and even values for @xmath44 versus upper - level energy , but this trend may not hold in all bridge regions .",
    "a second assumption is that the 00 s(0 ) and s(1 ) transitions can be fitted by a single temperature component .",
    "excitation diagrams for @xmath0 observations are usually fitted by several temperature components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to explore this assumption we use the low - res regions c and j , where we were able to measure the s(2 ) and s(3 ) lines , to investigate how this assumption affects the results . the fits for these regions",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : excite2 ] , while the gas parameters are presented in table  [ tab : excipars ] .",
    "we find that in addition to a cool component , a warmer component ( @xmath6430440  k ) is needed to explain the s(2 ) and s(3 ) measurements .",
    "however , the effect on the temperature of the coolest component , which dominates the mass surface density , is quite small .    a two - temperature fit can also be derived for hi - res bridge / arm region , since the hi - res data includes the s(2 ) line .",
    "we find @xmath45  k for the coolest component , and @xmath46  k for the warmer one ( figure  [ fig : hiexcite ] , right panel ) .",
    "however , with only three observed points there is significant degeneracy between the temperature and the column density , so the results should be taken as very approximate and poorly constrained . adopting the above temperatures , the column density of @xmath47",
    "@xmath5  kpc@xmath9 in the cooler component would be 2.5 times the value derived from the low - res data , and is probably unrealistic .",
    "we consider them as strict upper limits only .",
    "table  [ tab : excipars ] also tabulates the @xmath0 line fluxes for the 00  s(0)s(2 ) lines for the nucleus and outer disk positions of ugc 12914 , and the ugc  12915 nucleus as measured from the hi - res spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : hiexcite ] shows the fits to the excitation diagrams for the positions on the galaxies in the left panel .",
    "to quantify the strength of the @xmath0 emission , we compare the total flux in the @xmath0 00 s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines with the pah emission in the irac 8.0 @xmath3 band .",
    "the pah8@xmath3 strength is estimated using the method of @xcite , in which the flux from the starlight - dominated 3.6  @xmath3 band , scaled by a factor 0.232 , is subtracted from the flux in the 8.0  @xmath3 band .",
    "following @xcite , we plot the luminosity ratio @xmath48(pah8@xmath3 ) against the 24  @xmath3 luminosity @xmath49 , for both the low- and hi - res extraction regions in figure  [ fig : h2pah ] . the 24  @xmath3 luminosity is determined from the mips measurements for all of the data points , except for the hi - res apertures . for the hi - res apertures associated with the galaxies ,",
    "the mips measurements are very sensitive to the exact centering of the extraction box , and so we self - consistently used the average flux over the range 22.525.0  @xmath3 from the spectrum to form the 24  @xmath3 continuum .",
    "this also ensures that any bias introduced in the extractions by assuming the lines come from a point source rather than an extended source do not somehow influence the results since the slit correction factor for point sources would disappear in the ratio .",
    "in addition to the taffy regions , we show star forming galaxies , liners , and seyferts from the sings sample @xcite . we also show the sq shock sub - region @xcite and arp 143 knot g , which had the highest @xmath48(pah8@xmath3 ) ratio of any part of the arp 143 system @xcite .",
    "@xmath50(pah8@xmath3 ) has been determined in the same way for all data points .    in figure  [",
    "fig : h2pah ] we have distinguished between spectra taken on the bright parts of the galaxy disks and spectra taken between the galaxies in the bridge .",
    "the spectra centered close to bright disk regions ( or the nuclei themselves ) show @xmath51(pah8@xmath3 ) ratios typical of star - forming galaxies and likely associated with photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) around young stars .",
    "the @xmath48(pah8@xmath3 ) ratio in the taffy bridge regions are much larger than in the bright disks , and are generally higher than those of the sings agns .",
    "we note that region f , which includes the giant region , shows a higher @xmath48(pah8@xmath3 ) ratio than is typical of star forming galaxies .",
    "this is not surprising , since it lies in the bridge and may have both bridge and pdr - type heating present along the line of sight .",
    "there is generally good agreement between the high and low resolution data in the emission regions within the galaxies .",
    "the hi - res spectra of the ugc 12915 nucleus cover the same part of the system as region g , the ugc 12914 nucleus is comparable to region h , the northern clump of ugc 12914 is comparable to region a , and the ugc 12914 southern knot is not far from region p. these regions have @xmath48(pah8@xmath3 ) ratios on the high end of the star forming galaxy distribution which , along with their positions within the galaxies , suggests that the excitation mechanism may be the same as that of the star forming ( not agn dominated ) sings galaxies , namely pdr heating .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by examining figure  [ fig : h2l24 ] , which shows the ratio @xmath52 , as in @xcite .",
    "in addition to the sq shock sub - region and arp 143 knot g , we also plot here 3c 326 n @xcite .",
    "emission at 24 @xmath3 is mostly due to warm dust heated by young stars .",
    "the relative @xmath0 emission in the taffy bridge regions is considerably stronger than that in the star forming galaxies , and is also stronger than most of the agns .",
    "the bridge regions are generally comparable to 3c 326 n and arp 143 knot g , but somewhat weaker than the sq shock sub - region",
    ".    the possibility of pdr heating can also be investigated by comparing to the meudon pdr models of @xcite .",
    "the models use the flux ratio of the @xmath0 s(0)s(1 ) lines to the co(10 ) line to measure the heating rate in the molecular gas @xcite .",
    "we use the parameters of @xcite to produce four different models , with @xmath53 and 1000  @xmath54 and uv radiation scaling factor @xmath55 and 10 .",
    "the radiation scaling factor is defined relative to the uv field of @xcite .",
    "the models predict @xmath5660 for pdr heating . for comparison with the models",
    ", we use the co(10 ) data of @xcite , which give @xmath57  w  m@xmath9 over the entire bridge . using the total @xmath0 bridge flux of @xmath25  w  m@xmath9 , we find @xmath58 , about an order of magnitude above the predicted levels for pdr excitation .",
    "the two galaxies are not exceptionally strong @xmath0 emitters compared to the sings star forming galaxies , with @xmath48(pah8@xmath3 ) ratios only slightly above the most @xmath0-bright star forming galaxies .",
    "in contrast to most of the bridge , the two galaxies both host star formation .",
    "ugc 12915 seems to be in an early starburst phase @xcite , so much of the @xmath0 emission is likely to have a pdr origin .",

    ", we compare the @xmath59 ratios of ugc 12915 nucleus ( region g ) and ugc 12914 south ( region p ) . using the co(10 ) line profiles of @xcite and rescaling to match the areas of bridge region apertures g and p , we find co fluxes @xmath60 and @xmath61  w  m@xmath9 .",
    "this gives @xmath62 and 98 in ugc 12915 and ugc 12914 south , respectively .",
    "both galaxies have stronger @xmath0 emission than expected for pdr heating , but are within a factor of two of the models .",
    "it seems plausible that pdr heating is a significant source of heating in the galaxies , but there are probably additional heating sources as well .",
    "more significantly , the line ratios in the galaxies are considerably smaller than that in the bridge , highlighting the likely difference in the dominant heating mechanism .      given the relatively strong radio emission from the bridge region , we consider whether cosmic ray ( cr ) heating could be responsible for the excitation of the warm @xmath0 emission .",
    "this process involves low - energy cosmic rays ( 110  mev ) , which ionize some of the gas .",
    "the resulting primary and secondary electrons heat the gas , which excites the @xmath0 through collisions @xcite .",
    "radio continuum observations of the bridge provide some clues as to the energy density of cosmic rays .",
    "we caution however that the crs that are expected to excite @xmath0 are at the very low energy tail of the crs that give rise to the radio continuum emission .",
    "the vla 20  cm radio continuum flux in the mid - bridge is @xmath63  mjy per 5@xmath64 beam @xcite .",
    "we assume a power law spectral distribution of the form @xmath65 with @xmath66 over the range 1.494.96  ghz , and a plasma depth of 12  kpc ( roughly the scale of the bridge ) .",
    "the minimum equipartition magnetic field is found to be 6.4  @xmath67 g ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a lower spectral cut - off at 10  mhz .",
    "this is close to the value obtained by @xcite under similar assumptions .",
    "the corresponding magnetic energy density is @xmath68  j  m@xmath69 .",
    "this energy density is uncertain to within at least a factor of two because of uncertainties in the value of the proton / electron energy ratio ( assumed unity ) , as well as uncertainties in the volume filling factor of the magnetic field ( also assumed to be unity ) and the depth of the plasma column .",
    "if the energy density in the cosmic rays @xmath70 @xmath6 @xmath71 , then we can estimate the power available for heating @xmath72 = @xmath70 @xmath73 @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the efficiency of the cr heating of @xmath11 , and @xmath76 is the characteristic deposition timescale .",
    "for the central bridge , assuming a depth of 12  kpc , this corresponds to a luminosity surface density @xmath77 = 4.5 @xmath73 10@xmath78 ( @xmath75/@xmath79 )  w  kpc@xmath9 , where @xmath79 is the deposition timescale in units of 10  myr , the approximate expansion timescale of the bridge .",
    "we estimate @xmath75 by approximating the energy deposited by a typical mev cosmic ray from its specific stopping power measured in mev per unit column density .",
    "a value of 3.5  mev g@xmath17 cm@xmath9 is quoted for typical mev cosmic rays in the ism @xcite , where the column density is that of the target material , in this case a mixture of molecular hydrogen and . with @xmath0 column densities in the taffy bridge of @xmath6@xmath81 molecule cm@xmath9 ,",
    "the stopping power liberated by the passage of these crs through this medium would be of order @xmath82  mev per particle . even allowing for the existence of more cold @xmath0 material , this implies @xmath83 . in order to power the @xmath0 for the lifetime of the bridge ( @xmath84 ) with a measured @xmath0 surface brightness of @xmath6@xmath85  w  kpc@xmath9 , a cosmic ray energy density of at least 100 times that derived from equipartition arguments would be required .",
    "alternatively , crs could heat the @xmath0 if we are observing the system during a deposition burst ( @xmath86 0.01 ) .",
    "such a process would have to be global , perhaps taking the form of a sudden injection of crs streaming from the galactic disks , but this seems unlikely .",
    "another approach to evaluating the influence of cosmic rays , which is independent of assumptions about equipartition , is to estimate the ionization rate @xmath87 needed to balance the @xmath0 line cooling if crs were the primary heating source .",
    "the adopted @xmath0 surface brightness of 1.5@xmath88  w  kpc@xmath9 gives a cooling rate @xmath89  w  molecule@xmath17 , assuming an average mass density of @xmath90  @xmath8  kpc@xmath9 over the bridge .",
    "the heating rate by cr ionization has been estimated by various authors .",
    "@xcite estimate the cr heating to be @xmath91  w  molecule@xmath17 , where @xmath92 is the @xmath0 ionization rate .",
    "balancing @xmath0 cooling with cr heating under these assumptions would require an ionization rate of @xmath610@xmath93  s@xmath17",
    ". under the same assumptions , @xcite and @xcite infer similar values for the ionization rate in the moheg radio galaxy 3c 326 , where shocks were implicated .",
    "this ionization rate is significantly higher than that measured in the molecular clouds in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "thus , on purely comparative grounds , a cr ionization rate in the taffy bridge would again require an unusually high cr energy density , perhaps 10 times that of the unusual galactic center regions and @xmath6100 times the galactic neighborhood .",
    "based on these arguments we can conclude that cosmic rays are unlikely to be responsible for heating the @xmath0 in the taffy bridge .",
    "this process is closely related to cosmic ray heating . in the previous subsection we estimated that the magnetic energy density in the bridge plasma was about @xmath68  j  m@xmath69",
    "again assuming a bridge depth of about 12  kpc , the energy column density is @xmath94  j  kpc@xmath9 . supposing that this magnetic energy is extracted on the bridge expansion timescale of about 10@xmath95  yr @xcite , we expect a surface luminosity of about , @xmath96  w  kpc@xmath9 .",
    "this is comparable to the corresponding cosmic ray surface luminosity , as would be expected from the equipartition approximation of the previous subsection . like the cosmic ray luminosity",
    ", this estimate must be corrected for an efficiency factor , representing the fraction of the reconnection energy used to excite @xmath0 .",
    "this should include both direct excitation from the radiation from reconnection regions , and indirect processes , like broader ambient heating from reconnection . in either case",
    "we expect a very low efficiency , since the plasma will be transparent to most wavebands of the broad radiation spectrum produced directly or indirectly in reconnection events .",
    "note that the surface luminosity estimate above assumes the extraction of all of the magnetic energy on the adopted timescale , and so is an overestimate . on the other hand ,",
    "it does not account for additional field generation in turbulent dynamos .",
    "this process may be locally important , but it is hard to see how it could have a global effect in the short time available . with the magnetic field estimate above , and mass density",
    "@xmath97  @xmath8  kpc@xmath9 estimated from @xcite , the alfvn velocity @xmath98  km  s@xmath17 , an order of magnitude less than the bridge expansion velocity of 450  km  s@xmath17 @xcite , so even the propagation of magnetic effects must be very localized . to create significant power over the whole bridge",
    "would require some organized triggering of many localized reconnection events .",
    "one possible mechanism is large - scale turbulence , to be discussed in the next section .",
    "turbulence could , in principal , create locally tangled magnetic fields which could then be stretched by the galaxies as they move apart , creating the conditions for possible reconnection . if the turbulence continued to be present over a long period of time",
    ", new events could continue to be created which might heat the @xmath11 .",
    "thus , although unlikely , we can not completely rule out magnetic reconnection as another source of @xmath0 heating .    specifically ,",
    "if the typical reconnection scale relative to the bridge size is much less than the ratio of the alfvn speed to the bridge expansion speed , then the reconnection timescale is much less than the age of the bridge . in that case , with a short timescale for reconnection , the reconnection luminosity is likely to decay on a similar timescale , yielding less luminosity than at earlier times .",
    "a more likely source for @xmath0 heating is turbulence , created in the wake of the collision between the two galaxies .",
    "we estimate turbulent heating rate @xmath99 using    @xmath100    where @xmath101 is the velocity width over a length scale @xmath102 , the factor 2.36 converts the line width to the rms velocity of the gas , and @xmath103 is the energy dissipation timescale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from the co observations of @xcite , we take @xmath104  km  s@xmath17 over a beam of 14@xmath64 , or @xmath105 kpc .",
    "this yields @xmath106  yr .",
    "the heating rate is then @xmath107  w  molecule@xmath17 , about 50% of the observed cooling rate of @xmath108  w  molecule@xmath17 .",
    "turbulence on this scale could contribute significantly to the gas heating , provided that it is relatively efficient .",
    "a related possibility is heating by shocks . as noted earlier , the h@xmath2 line cooling time is very short , and _ in - situ _ heating by shocks or turbulence is consistent with the need to maintain the observed gas at @xmath6160170  k for a reasonable fraction of the bridge lifetime .",
    "we may obtain a crude estimate of the energy available in shocks by examining the bulk mechanical energy associated with the post - shock gas .",
    "the co velocity dispersion , which should roughly track the velocity dispersion of the cold h@xmath2 , is ( 200/2.36 )  km  s@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the @xmath0 mass to be @xmath109  @xmath8 , so over the 20  myr since the collision the average heating rate is @xmath110  w. this is comparable to the bridge @xmath0 luminosity of @xmath111  w.    this estimate can be checked against an upper limit to the available power estimated using the bulk kinetic energy of the and @xmath0 gas in the bridge .",
    "a re - analysis of the radio data of @xcite by @xcite determined that the mass in the bridge is @xmath112  @xmath8 .",
    "we take this mass as the pre - shock mass , and a collision velocity of 450  km  s@xmath17 @xcite in the shock frame .",
    "the time since the collision is @xmath113  myr , so the total available power from the is @xmath114  w , about 2 orders of magnitude higher than the @xmath0 luminosity .    of course",
    ", not all of the available power from any heating mechanism will be dissipated via @xmath0 line emission .",
    "we note that h@xmath2 will not be the only line - coolant in the shock , although it could be a significant one .",
    "for example , in our modeling of the similar shock - heating of the stephan s quintet system , we estimate that 75% of the line cooling in the molecular shocks is from h@xmath2 , with the majority of the other cooling through h@xmath2o , co and [ ] @xmath3 line emission .",
    "the details of the cooling channel would depend somewhat on the mix of c- and j - shocks ( see @xcite ) .",
    "other , higher velocity shocks which might be present could also dissipate significant energy through mechanisms such as ly-@xmath18 emission and other uv coolants , as well as diffuse x - ray gas heated in the collision .",
    "there is not currently any x - ray data available for the taffy that could be used to determine the significance of x - ray cooling in the system . in stephan s quintet ,",
    "the total x - ray luminosity is about 3 times lower than the @xmath0 line luminosity @xcite , but it is not clear that the same fraction should apply to the taffy .",
    "the presence of shocks is required by the recent model of @xcite . in the model ,",
    "strong shocks in the taffy bridge accelerate charged particles to ultrarelativistic energies , which then produce the synchrotron emission observed in the radio continuum .",
    "we conclude that the largest heating source is probably shocks , as in the model presented by @xcite which was developed to explain the powerful @xmath0 emission detected in the giant intergalactic shock wave in stephan s quintet .",
    "the essential ingredients of this model are a high - speed shock wave that is driven into a multi - phase medium , leading to the collapse and shock - heating of denser material .",
    "molecules form rapidly on dust grains which survive in the denser clumps of material , and strong @xmath0 emission results .",
    "models fitted to the @xmath0 excitation diagrams in stephan s quintet show that the emission is consistent with several low and medium velocity c - shocks , although more destructive j - shocks can not be ruled out .",
    "our observations do not provide enough points on the excitation diagram to justify extensive shock - modeling , but the similarities with the spectra seen in the taffy bridge ( powerful @xmath0 with only low - excitation metal lines ) and the approximately similar low-@xmath43 temperature fits suggest a common origin for the @xmath0 excitation .    by analogy with stephan s quintet ,",
    "a distribution of shock velocities , related to the density distribution in the shocked gas , is likely to be present @xcite . in the gas that is less dense than the molecular gas",
    ", shock velocities @xmath115 100 km s@xmath17 are likely , which will ionize the medium .",
    "these shock velocities can be estimated using the observed ratio [ ] 15.56 @xmath3/[]12.81  @xmath3 , which we obtain from the hi - res bridge / arm region where both of these lines were observed with the sh module.12.81  @xmath3 was observed in the low - res data only in regions c and j. since it falls on a separate module from the [ ] 15.56 @xmath3 line , the ratio will depend on the scaling factor chosen between the two modules .",
    "we therefore opt instead to use the hi - res bridge / arm region , where both lines fall on the sh module and the ratio is independent of scaling . ]",
    "these lines can also originate with star formation , and the observed line ratio [ ] / [ ] @xmath116 in the bridge / arm region is within the range typical of star forming regions @xcite , but h@xmath18 maps show no evidence of significant star formation in the taffy bridge @xcite , though star formation is likely to be present in the ugc 12914 spiral arm .",
    "we use the mappings shock models of @xcite for a magnetic field of 5 @xmath67 g and a pre - shock gas density between 0.1100  @xmath54 , as shown in figure  [ fig : shockz ] .",
    "the shock velocity for the taffy bridge falls in the range 100300  km  s@xmath17 , comparable to the sq shock @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : h2pah ] and [ fig : h2l24 ] may provide some insight into the location of the strongest shocks .",
    "figure  [ fig : h2pah ] shows a spatial trend in @xmath48(pah ) , with values close to those of the galaxies at the bridge / galaxy interface growing to become comparable to the sq shock near the center of the bridge .",
    "a similar trend is found in @xmath52 , shown in figure  [ fig : h2l24 ] .",
    "this suggests that the shocks in the taffy bridge are strongest relative to other excitation mechanisms near its center .",
    "it is worth making some additional comparison between the properties of the taffy bridge and those in the large - scale shocked filaments in the stephan s quintet system @xcite .",
    "the mean surface brightness of the low resolution s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines is @xmath61.5@xmath88  w  kpc@xmath9 , more than a factor of 2 larger than the equivalent emission averaged over the inner region of the main shock in stephan s quintet , which we estimate to be 7@xmath7310@xmath117  w  kpc@xmath9 for the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines .",
    "thus the surface brightness in the taffy is greater , reflecting a larger surface mass density of excited gas .",
    "we can probably rule out higher excitation of the warm gas as the explanation because , as we show in section  [ sec : co ] , the ratio of warm to total @xmath0 gas in the taffy is probably lower ( within the considerable uncertainties ) than that in sq .",
    "thus the higher surface luminosity is almost certainly a result of the different quantities of gas being swept up in the shock in the taffy compared with sq , because of the different nature of the collisions in the two systems .    alternatively , the higher surface density of warm gas may be purely geometrical  the taffy bridge could be deeper in the plane of the sky than the sq shock , a result of very different collision geometries in the two cases . the total gas mass in the taffy bridge would depend on many complicated factors resulting from the geometry of the original collision , including disk impact parameters and inclination and the rotational kinematics of the disks .",
    "all of these factors would govern how much mass is splashed into the bridge and its projected surface density ( see @xcite ) .",
    "local luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ) and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) comprise a high fraction of collisional or merging systems .",
    "the taffy system has a far - ir luminosity as measured by @xcite @xmath118  @xmath119 , just short of the definition of a lirg .",
    "however , given the head - on collision between the taffy galaxies , it is likely that they will eventually merge through dynamical friction .",
    "thus the taffy may move from its current pre - lirg status to that of a lirg or ulirg if the two galaxies are drawn back together .",
    "extended mid - ir @xmath0 emission is seen in @xmath670@xmath120 of a sample of nearby ulirgs @xcite , and shocks driven into their outer disks have been hypothesized but not proven @xcite .",
    "the existence of extended shocked @xmath0 in the taffy system 20  myr after the initial collision suggests that @xmath0 emission can persist for a time comparable with the dynamical crossing time . thus given the even more chaotic nature of the gas - rich major mergers believed to explain many local ulirgs , and their expected rapid coalescence rates , it seems plausible that the @xmath0 emission seen in ulirgs may result from shocked processes broadly similar to that seen in the taffy .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of the taffy system is the fact that the peak concentration is in the bridge between the two galaxies @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the co  ( 10 ) map of @xcite shows that the molecular gas has its highest concentrations in the galaxies .",
    "however , the molecular gas is present throughout the bridge , so that the total @xmath0 mass in the bridge appears to be comparable to that of the galaxies .",
    "the estimated total @xmath0 mass depends on the conversion factor @xmath121 , which is unknown . to estimate the warm gas fraction in the bridge , defined as the ratio of the warm @xmath0 mass derived from the low - res irs observations to the @xmath0 mass derived from the co observations , we first use the galactic value of @xmath122  cm@xmath9/ (  k  km  s@xmath17 ) .",
    "the warm @xmath0 mass is estimated to be @xmath123  @xmath8 based on the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines ( see section [ sec : exc ] ) .",
    "this gives a a warm gas fraction in the bridge of 0.09 .",
    "we note that in the case of stephan s quintet , recent measurements with the iram 30  m telescope @xcite suggest comparable values along the main intergalactic shock @xmath1240.33 using the same galactic @xmath125 factor .",
    "however , the value of the @xmath125-factor in the taffy bridge could be lower than the galactic value by a factor of a few . based on @xmath126co measurements",
    ", @xcite suggested that the @xmath125 factor could be at least a factor of 4 lower than the galactic value in the bridge region , which would increase the warm gas fraction by a factor of four .",
    "@xcite fit large velocity gradient models to co line ratios and determined that @xmath127  cm@xmath9/(k km s@xmath17 ) in the bridge , which implies @xmath128  @xmath8 and @xmath129 .",
    "therefore , the warm @xmath0 gas fraction in the bridge is poorly constrained , likely being in the range @xmath130 .",
    "this is on the upper end of the distribution for the sings galaxies @xcite .",
    "together with the absence of obvious source of uv heating , the bracketed range of warm @xmath0 gas fraction suggests an active heat source from shocks .",
    "we have reported on the detection of powerful mid - ir emission lines of @xmath0 in the taffy galaxies .",
    "our main results are :    1 .",
    "the mid - ir spectrum of the taffy bridge bears a striking similarity to the spectrum of the group - wide shock in stephan s quintet .",
    "in particular , the @xmath48(pah8@xmath3 ) ratio is unusually high in the bridge , exceeding by an order of magnitude that found in sings star forming galaxies @xcite , while the galaxies ugc 12914/5 are comparable to star forming galaxies .",
    "2 .   the warm @xmath0",
    "is distributed throughout the bridge between the two galaxies .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath0 detected previously using sub - mm observations of co. it is also comparable to the distribution of 20  cm radio continuum and dust emission .",
    "single - temperature fits to the two @xmath0 lines measured throughout the bridge indicate a nearly uniform temperature of 150175  k. we also estimate a mass density @xmath6@xmath7  @xmath8  kpc@xmath9 .",
    "we measure a warm @xmath0 mass of @xmath131  @xmath8 in the observed parts of the bridge , and predict a total mass in the complete bridge of 9(+2/@xmath132  @xmath8 if the rest of the bridge has the same properties as that observed .",
    "the @xmath0 surface luminosity in the taffy bridge is more than a factor of two larger than the main shock region in sq , probably because of different collision geometries and initial conditions .",
    "since the @xmath0 line cooling time is many orders of magnitude shorter than the dynamical timescale for the bridge , _ in situ _ heating is required to explain the observed warm temperature of the bridge gas . the @xmath0 gas is probably heated by turbulence and shocks produced during the collision , and also by continuing cloud collisions in the bridge .",
    "we have determined that the @xmath0 molecule provides an important cooling channel for the warm gas in the taffy bridge .",
    "other molecules may also be important .",
    "future observations ( granted in open time 1 ) with the _ herschel space observatory _ will allow us to further explore the thermodynamic state of the shocked ism bridge .",
