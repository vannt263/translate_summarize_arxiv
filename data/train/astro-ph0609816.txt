    "<S> we consider essential mechanisms for orbit - shrinkage or `` hardening '' of compact binaries in globular clusters to the point of roche - lobe contact and x - ray emission phase , focussing on the process of collisional hardening due to encounters between binaries and single stars in the cluster core . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between this kind of hardening and that due to emission of gravitational radiation produces a characteristic scaling of the orbit - shrinkage time with the single - star binary encounter rate @xmath0 in the cluster which we introduce , clarify , and explore . </S>",

    "<S> x - rays : binaries    introduction .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that globular clusters contain far more than their fair share of compact x - ray binaries per unit stellar mass , compared to their host galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement factor is @xmath1 in the milky way and m31 ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and possibly much higher in elliptical galaxies , as recent _ chandra _ observations have suggested ( @xcite , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this overabundance of close binaries has been realized for some thirty years now to be the dynamical formation of such binaries  through tidal capture and/or exchange interactions  which can proceed at a very significant rate in dense cores of globular clusters ( henceforth gcs ) because of the high stellar - encounter rates there ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , but whose rate is negligible over the rest of the galaxy , where the stellar density is low by comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the gc x - ray binaries that we shall be mainly concerned with in this work are those which are powered by accretion onto compact stars </S>",
    "<S> . these can be either ( a ) low - mass x - ray binaries ( henceforth lmxbs ) , containing neutron stars accreting from low - mass companions , or , ( b ) cataclysmic variables ( henceforth cvs ) , containing white dwarfs accreting from low - mass companions . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we shall not explicitly consider here binaries which contain either ( a ) two `` normal '' solar - mass stars , one or both of which are coronally active , or , ( b ) recycled neutron stars operating as rotation - powered millisecond pulsars , with a white - dwarf or a low - mass normal companion , although such binaries can be low - luminosity x - ray sources . </S>",
    "<S> however , general considerations on the dynamical formation of close binaries do apply to these as well ; indeed , the latter binaries are now widely accepted as evolutionary products of lmxbs ( @xcite ) .    in tidal - capture formation of a compact - star binary , the compact star ( neutron star / white dwarf ) passing close to a normal star dissipates its kinetic energy significantly by creating tidal deformation in the latter star , and so becomes bound to it . in the exchange process of formation , a compact star replaces one of the stars of an existing binary system of two normal stars during a dynamical encounter ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> after formation in such an encounter , the compact - star binary continues to undergo stellar encounters in the dense cores of gcs , and it is on one particular effect of the continuing encounters that we focus in this paper . in the mid-1970s , it was realized that a major effect of the binary - single star encounters would be to extract energy from a given binary , making it more tightly bound or _ </S>",
    "<S> harder _ , and giving this energy to the motion of the single stars in the gc , thus `` heating '' the cluster ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can call this effect _ collisional hardening _ of the compact - star binary , which makes the binary s orbit shrink at a rate higher than that which would obtain if it were not subject to the above stellar encounters , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , if it were not in a gc . </S>",
    "<S> the latter rate is believed to be determined by a combination of two processes , _ viz . </S>",
    "<S> _ , ( a ) emission of gravitational radiation and ( b ) magnetic braking . in the former process , </S>",
    "<S> a compact binary emits gravitational radiation and so loses energy and angular momentum , which makes its orbit shrink @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter mechanism is envisaged as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the low - mass companion to the compact star has a significant magnetic field , and also has its rotation tidally coupled or `` locked '' to that of orbital revolution . </S>",
    "<S> the companion drives a wind , which carries away angular momentum at an enhanced rate because the magnetic field enforces co - rotation of the wind out to a radius considerably larger than that of the star , and this angular momentum ultimately comes from the orbit because of the above tidal locking , thus making the orbit shrink @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in this paper the relative roles of the above mechanisms for binary hardening , particularly the role of collisional hardening _ vis -  - vis _ that due to gravitational radiation , indicate and clarify a scaling that naturally emerges from this interplay , and briefly suggest possible observational signatures of this scaling .    in sec .  2 </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the hardening of compact binaries by the three mechanisms discussed above , bringing out the particular role of collisional hardening . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a characteristic scaling of the orbit - shrinkage time of such binaries with an essential gc parameter emerges because of the interplay between collisional hardening and that due to gravitational radiation . in sec .  3 , we explore possible observational signatures of this scaling . </S>",
    "<S> we sketch a very simple `` toy '' scheme for describing the evolution of compact x - ray binaries in gcs , and indicate a possible signature of the above scaling within the bounds of this toy model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that current data on x - ray binaries in gcs are consistent with this signature . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss our results in sec .  4 , exploring possible lines of future inquiry .    </S>",
    "<S> hardening of compact binaries .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider the shrinking of the orbital radius of a compact binary by the three mechanisms introduced above . </S>",
    "<S> consider gravitational radiation first . </S>",
    "<S> the rate at which the radius @xmath2 of a binary decreases due to this process is given by ( see , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , dinverno 1992 and references therein ) : @xmath3 in this equation , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the masses of the compact star and its companion in solar masses , @xmath6 is the total mass in the same units , and the orbital radius @xmath2 is expressed in units of solar radius . </S>",
    "<S> we shall use these units throughout this paper .    now consider magnetic braking . </S>",
    "<S> the orbit shrinkage rate due to this process is given in the original verbunt - zwaan prescription @xcite as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the radius of the companion . </S>",
    "<S> we give below further discussion on this mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> finally consider the rate of orbit shrinkage due to collisional hardening , which is given by @xcite , @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the mass of the single stars in the gc which are undergoing encounters with the binary . in this introductory work , we assume @xmath10 to be a constant , representing a suitable average value for a gc core , which we take to be @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath0 is a measure of the encounter rate between a given binary and the background of single stars in the core of the gc : it is a crucial property of the gc for our purposes , so that we shall use it constantly in this work . </S>",
    "<S> it scales as @xmath12 with the ( average ) core density @xmath13 of the gc , and the velocity dispersion @xmath14 of the stars in the core . following the convention often employed in the gc literature ( @xcite , @xcite ) , </S>",
    "<S> we can , in fact , _ define _ this parameter as : @xmath15 then the unit of @xmath0 is @xmath16 sec , corresponding to the units of @xmath13 and @xmath14 commonly used in the gc literature , namely , @xmath17 and km sec@xmath18 respectively . in these units , </S>",
    "<S> values of @xmath0 generally run in the range @xmath19 ( see below ) .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we take the mass of the compact star to be @xmath20 and that of the companion @xmath21 , the latter corresponding to a typical average mass of stars in a gc ( see above ) . </S>",
    "<S> according to the mass - radius relation for low - mass main - sequence stars , the radius of a main - sequence companion will then be @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we consider only circular orbits in this work , returning to this point in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 .    </S>",
    "<S> the total rate of orbit shrinkage due to the combination of the above mechanisms is given by : @xmath23 we emphasize that the first two terms in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tot ] ) are always operational , irrespective of whether the binary is in a gc or not , and it is the relative effect of the third term , which represents the effects of the encounters in a gc core , that we wish to study here . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between the first and the third term was investigated in a pioneering study by @xcite , before the magnetic braking mechanism was postulated @xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> due to gravitational radiation , magnetic braking and collisional hardening , shown as functions of the binary separation @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> also shown is the total shrinkage rate . </S>",
    "<S> value of @xmath0 as indicated.__,width=340 ]    note first that the three terms have different regions of dominance , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ dominance ] . </S>",
    "<S> collisional hardening dominates at large values of the orbital separation @xmath2 , _ i.e. _ , for wide binaries , while hardening by gravitational radiation and magnetic braking dominates at small @xmath2 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , for narrow binaries . between the latter two , </S>",
    "<S> magnetic braking dominates at the smallest orbital separations , if we adopt the original verbunt - zwaan ( henceforth vz ) scaling for it ( see below ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relative orbit shrinkage rate @xmath24 thus scales as @xmath2 at large orbit separations , passes through a minimum at a critical separation @xmath25 where the gravitational radiation shrinkage rate , scaling as @xmath26 , takes over from collisional hardening , and finally rises at very small separations as @xmath27 due to vz magnetic braking . </S>",
    "<S> the change - over from gravitational radiation shrinkage to that due to magnetic braking occurs at a radius @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> these two critical radii are easily obtained from eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gw ] ) , ( [ mb ] ) , and ( [ coll ] ) , and are given by @xmath29 note the scaling @xmath30 , which is crucial for much of our discussion here , as we shall see below . </S>",
    "<S> the critical orbital separation @xmath25 varies in the range @xmath31 for the canonical range of values of the above gc parameter @xcite @xmath32 in the above units @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of this to close compact - star binaries in gcs is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> when such a binary is formed , its orbital separation in most cases is such that the low - mass companion is not in roche lobe contact , since the roche - lobe radius has to be @xmath33 or less for this to happen for a typical low - mass main sequence or subgiant companion of mass @xmath34 ( see above ) . </S>",
    "<S> mass transfer does not occur under such circumstances , so that such binaries are pre - lmxbs or pre - cvs , and we can call them by the general name _ </S>",
    "<S> pre - x - ray binaries _ , or pxbs for short . </S>",
    "<S> it is the above orbit - shrinkage or hardening process that brings the companion into roche - lobe contact , so that mass transfer begins , and the pxb turns on as an x - ray binary ( lmxb or cv ) , or xb for short .    </S>",
    "<S> depending on the initial separation @xmath35 of the binary , some or all of the above processes can thus play significant roles in shrinking it to the point where mass transfer begins . </S>",
    "<S> recent numerical simulations suggest that tidal - capture binaries are born with orbital radii ( or semi - major axes ) in the range @xmath36 for main - sequence ( henceforth ms ) or early subgiant companions , and in the range @xmath37 for horizontal - branch companions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for binaries formed by exchange encounters , the orbital radii are generally expected to be somewhat larger than those for corresponding tidal binaries with identical members . </S>",
    "<S> thus , both collisional hardening and gravitational radiation are expected to play major roles in the orbital shrinkage to roche - lobe contact for most of the pxbs in gcs , whether dynamically formed or primordial .    </S>",
    "<S> although we have included magnetic braking as above for completeness , its role in hardening of pxbs into xbs appears to be rather insignificant , at least for the vz scaling adopted above . </S>",
    "<S> this is evident from the fact that there is little change in any of the results described here whether magnetic braking is included or not . for the vz </S>",
    "<S> scaling , this is easy to understand . with a steep increase at small @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> this effect is significant only at very small orbital separation , when the pxb has already come into roche - lobe contact and become an xb . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this process may well be significant in the further orbital evolution of the xb as mass - transfer proceeds ( @xcite , @xcite ) , but not in the pxb - hardening process under study here .    </S>",
    "<S> actually , further study of magnetic braking since the original vz formulation has revealed many interesting points . </S>",
    "<S> the nature and strength of this effect very likely depends on the mass and evolutionary state of the companion star . </S>",
    "<S> for example , magnetic braking may become totally ineffective for very low - mass companions with @xmath38 or less , as these stars are fully convective . </S>",
    "<S> whereas a significant convective envelope is necessary for strong magnetic braking , `` anchoring '' of the magnetic field in a radiative core is also believed to be essential for it , and it is argued that the effect would basically vanish when the star becomes fully convective ( @xcite , @xcite ) . indeed , this forms the basis for the standard explanation for the _ period gap _ in cvs ( @xcite and references therein ) . </S>",
    "<S> further , studies of the rotation periods of stars in open clusters have suggested that magnetic braking may be less effective than that given by the vz prescription : this has been modelled in recent literature by either ( a ) the vz scaling as above , but a smaller numerical constant than that given above , or , ( b ) a `` saturation '' effect below a critical value of @xmath2 , wherein the scaling changes from the vz @xmath39 scaling of eq .  ( [ mb ] ) to a much slower @xmath40 scaling below this critical @xmath2-value ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> while these modifications are of relevance to xb evolution , it does not appear that they can alter the pxb - hardening results described here in any significant way . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we shall not discuss magnetic braking any further here , and keep this term in the complete equations only to remind ourselves that it is operational , in principle , for companions with @xmath41 .    an interesting scaling    interplay between collisional hardening and gravitational - radiation hardening near the above critical orbital separation @xmath25 produces a characteristic scaling , which we now describe . </S>",
    "<S> consider the shrinkage time @xmath42 of a pxb from an initial orbital separation @xmath35 to the final separation @xmath43 corresponding to roche - lobe contact and the onset of mass transfer , given by : @xmath44 for given values of stellar masses , @xmath42 scales with the gc parameter @xmath0 introduced above as @xmath45 the scaling is almost exact at high values of @xmath0 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , @xmath46 , say , there being a slight fall - off from this scaling at low @xmath0 s .     in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tpxb ] ) shown as function of orbital separation @xmath2 , with values of @xmath0 as indicated.__,width=340 ]    how does this scaling arise ? to see this , consider first the qualitative features of the integrand on the right - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tpxb ] ) , _ i.e. _ , the reciprocal of the total shrinkage rate at an orbital separation @xmath2 , which we denote by @xmath47 , and which is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ peak ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is sharply peaked at @xmath48 : indeed , the peak would be _ exactly _ at the above critical separation @xmath25 but for the effects of magnetic braking , as can be readily verified . </S>",
    "<S> since the latter effects are not important in the range of @xmath2-values relevant for this problem , as explained above , we can get a good estimate of the actual result by considering only gravitational radiation and collisional hardening . </S>",
    "<S> because of this dominant , sharp peak in @xmath47 , most of the contribution to the integral , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , to @xmath42 , comes from there , provided that the integration limits ( @xmath49 ) are such that _ all or most of the peak is included_. we assume for the moment that this is so , and return to a discussion in the next subsection of what happens when this condition fails .    under the above circumstances </S>",
    "<S> , we can immediately give a rough estimate of @xmath42 , which is the area under the curve in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ peak ] , as @xmath50(maximum value of the above integrand ) . </S>",
    "<S> this maximum value is simply @xmath51 if we neglect magnetic braking , since the gravitational radiation term equals the collisional hardening term there , as explained above . </S>",
    "<S> this gives @xmath52 , which , with the aid of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ acrit ] ) , yields @xmath53 . </S>",

    "<S> it is this basic scaling that leads to the essential behavior of the shrinkage time @xmath42 discussed in this paper .    </S>",
    "<S> breakdown of scaling ?    when would the above scaling break down , and why ? </S>",
    "<S> a simple answer is clear from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ peak ] : this would happen when the integration limits ( @xmath49 ) are such that all or most of the above peak in @xmath47 is _ not _ included . </S>",
    "<S> for the present problem , this basically reduces to an upper bound on @xmath43 , since @xmath35 is normally large enough to ensure that the region of integration in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ peak ] extends well into considerably larger values of @xmath2 beyond the peak . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath43 becomes so large as to exceed @xmath25 , the region of integration is severely curtailed from the left in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ peak ] , so that most of the peak s contribution is missed , and the above scaling breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> we might think that such a situation would arise when the low - mass companion in the pxb is an evolved , horizontal - branch star , which has a much larger radius than a ms / subgiant companion of the same mass , and so would be expected to come into roche - lobe contact at a much larger value of @xmath60 , say @xmath61 , and correspondingly larger values of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> but such binaries are not relevant to our discussion here , since the lifetimes ( @xmath62 y ) of such horizontal - branch stars are too short to be of significance to the long binary - hardening timescales under consideration here . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this possibility is not of practical importance here .    </S>",
    "<S> however , there _ is _ a situation in which this scaling is not relevant , not because it breaks down , but , rather because we move into a region of @xmath0-values where @xmath42 computed in the above way exceeds the expected main - sequence lifetime @xmath63 of the low - mass ms / early - subgiant companion . under these circumstances , </S>",
    "<S> the companion starts evolving into a giant and rapidly fills its roche lobe , for essentially any value that @xmath2 is likely to have at that stage . </S>",
    "<S> this is formally equivalent to saying that @xmath42 saturates at a value @xmath63 in this range of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we return to this point below .    </S>",
    "<S> shrinkage time    we now calculate the exact variation of the shrinkage time @xmath42 with the encounter - rate parameter @xmath0 introduced earlier , keeping all terms in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> , we need to specify the initial and final values , @xmath35 and @xmath43 , of the orbital separation . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt @xmath64 for ms / subgiant companions corresponding to roche - lobe contact , when the radius of the roche - lobe @xmath60 of the companion becomes equal to the radius of the companion itself . </S>",
    "<S> this translates into the above value of the orbital separation @xmath43 by the well - known paczyski relation : @xmath65 corresponding to @xmath60 being equal to companion radius @xmath66 for a companion mass @xmath67 .    in general </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath35 will have a value which is within a possible range @xmath68 , which is indicated in table [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this range depends on the formation - mode of the binary , and also on the evolutionary status of the companion . </S>",
    "<S> the former has two possibilities , namely , ( a ) the binary is primordial , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , it was already a binary when the globular cluster formed , or , ( b ) it formed by tidal capture or exchange interactions in the dense core of the globular cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has also two basic possibilities , namely that the companion is either ( a ) a ms / subgiant , or , ( b ) a horizontal - branch star , as explained earlier . as explained above , however , the short lifetimes of horizontal - branch ( @xcite , @xcite ) stars compared to the timescales of hardening processes under study here make it clear that they are of little importance in this problem , and we shall not consider them any further in this work . </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath72 calculated as above exceeds this value of @xmath63 , what happens is that the companion evolves into a giant , and so comes into roche - lobe contact at a time @xmath76 for essentially all plausible values of @xmath2 at this point , irrespective of the calculated value of @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> this is formally equivalent to the statement that @xmath72 reaches a saturation value of @xmath63 at low values of @xmath0 , the change - over occurring at @xmath77 such that @xmath78 . </S>",

    "<S> evolution of compact - star binaries in globular clusters    how can we test the above scaling ? </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath84 is not directly observable , are there possible signatures that its scaling with @xmath0 might leave in the observed behavior of the populations of compact x - ray binaries in globular clusters ? </S>",
    "<S> we briefly consider this question now and suggest possible answers .    as remarked earlier , pxbs are formed in gcs primarily by tidal capture and exchange interactions in the gc core . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of the former process is proportional to the encounter rate between single stars in the gc core . the latter rate is commonly denoted by @xmath85 in the literature , and it scales as @xmath86 with the average core density @xmath13 , the velocity dispersion @xmath14 of the stars in the core , and the core radius @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> we can describe this as a rate of increase of the number @xmath88 of pxbs in the gc which is @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a constant . in an exchange interaction , one of the members of a binary consisting of two normal stars </S>",
    "<S> is replaced by a heavier compact star . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of this process is proportional to the encounter rate between the above two populations . assuming the population of compact stars in a gc to scale with the entire stellar population in the gc , and also the population of normal - star binaries in a gc to scale with its total population , both of which are normally done </S>",
    "<S> , the rate of the exchange process also scales with the square of the stellar density , and therefore with the above @xmath85 parameter , and we can express it in a similar vein as @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is another constant . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can write the entire formation rate phenomenologically as @xmath93 , where @xmath94 .    after formation </S>",
    "<S> , two main processes affect the fate of the pxbs . </S>",
    "<S> the first is the process of the hardening of the pxb to the point of roche - lobe overflow and conversion into an xb , as discussed in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> this proceeds on a timescale @xmath42 , which means that the pxb population decreases on a timescale @xmath42 , which we can describe phenomenologically by a rate of decrease of @xmath88 which is @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> this process may be slightly modified by second - order ones , which are normally ignored . </S>",
    "<S> for example , during the above hardening , an exchange encounter of the pxb with a single normal gc star heavier than the companion in the pxb can replace the latter .    </S>",
    "<S> the second process is the destruction of a pxb by its encounter with single stars in the gc core . </S>",
    "<S> this can happen in the two following ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , a fraction of the star - pxb encounters leads to a disruption or _ ionization _ of the pxb . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a reduction in @xmath88 , whose rate is proportional to @xmath0 , the star - binary encounter rate introduced earlier , and also to @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus express this rate of decrease in @xmath88 phenomenologically as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , in a smaller fraction of such encounters , a compact star can replace the normal low - mass companion in an exchange encounter , resulting in the formation of a double compact - star binary . </S>",
    "<S> this is equivalent to destroying the pxb , since such a binary will not evolve into an xb . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of this process scales with both @xmath88 and the rate of encounter between a given pxb and compact stars . </S>",
    "<S> if we again argue that the population of compact stars in a gc scales with the entire stellar population in it , this rate is @xmath98 , and the rate of reduction of @xmath88 can be written phenomenologically as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is a constant . </S>",
    "<S> the total pxb destruction rate can thus be written as @xmath101 , with @xmath102 .    a simple `` toy '' evolutionary scheme    we now combine the above points into a simple `` toy '' description of pxb and xb evolution in gcs , which we can use in an attempt to extract possible signatures of the scaling described in this work . in this `` toy '' scheme , which is similar in spirit to that of @xcite and @xcite for following the evolution of x - ray binary populations of galaxies outside gcs </S>",
    "<S> , the evolution of the pxb population is given by : @xmath103 wherein the above rates of increase and decrease of @xmath88 have simply been collected together .    the evolution of the xb population @xmath104 resulting from the above pxbs is described in a similar manner : @xmath105 here , @xmath106 is the evolutionary timescale for xbs . </S>",
    "<S> the idea here is that xbs are created from pxbs at the rate @xmath107 , and conclude their mass - transfer phase , and so their lifetime as xbs , on a timescale @xmath106 .    in the spirit of the `` toy '' model , </S>",
    "<S> all timescales in equations ( [ pxbevol ] ) and ( [ xbevol ] ) can be considered constants , as can @xmath108 and @xmath109 , while in reality they depend on orbital parameters and stellar properties , as also on other parameters . </S>",
    "<S> these equations can then be solved readily , and of interest to us here is the asymptotic behavior , obtained by setting the time - derivatives to zero in these , which yields an xb population : @xmath110 the effect of collisional hardening is immediately seen on the right - hand side of eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xbasym ] ) , in the second term in the denominator . since collisional hardening always decreases @xmath84 , it increases @xmath104 , other things being equal . </S>",
    "<S> this enhancement in @xmath104 is as expected , as collisional hardening makes a larger number pxbs reach roche - lobe contact . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in a gc with given properties , the number of x - ray sources is expected to be enhanced by collisional hardening compared to what it would be if this effect were negligible .    </S>",
    "<S> signature of collisional hardening ?    can we look for observational evidence of the above enhancement in xb populations of gcs expected from collisional hardening ? </S>",
    "<S> we discuss briefly an attempt to use _ chandra _ observations of gcs to this end , with the cautionary remark that our evolutionary model , as given in the previous subsection , is still too simple - minded to apply quantitatively to actual gc data . </S>",
    "<S> what we are looking for , therefore , is a possible _ qualitative _ trend that is consistent with the ideas of collisional hardening discussed in this paper , which will encourage us to perform a more detailed study .    the trend given by eqn .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xbevol ] ) readily translates into one of the form @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are constants , independent of the cluster parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we can compare this with data obtained from _ </S>",
    "<S> _ observations of gcs , as given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ obs ] .     vs. @xmath0 for galactic globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> observational points with error bars from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> trend suggested by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xbasym1 ] ) shown for various distributions as indicated . also shown is the trend expected in absence of collisional hardening.__,width=340 ]    it is clear that the trend suggested by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xbasym1 ] ) is consistent with the data , while that expected when collisional hardening is entirely neglected is not . </S>",
    "<S> the flattening of the trend on inclusion of collisional hardening is precisely due to the scaling discussed in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> however , we stress again that ours is only a `` toy '' model at this stage , relevant only for exploring feasibility . to study the effect of @xmath35 distributions </S>",
    "<S> , we have normalized the constants @xmath114 and @xmath115 for each distribution by having the curve pass through two chosen points at the lowest and highest values of @xmath0 for which data is available . </S>",
    "<S> the results show clearly that varying the distribution has almost no effect on the trend .    </S>",
    "<S> discussions    the purpose of this paper is to point out an essential effect in the hardening of pxbs in gcs , _ viz . </S>",
    "<S> _ , that collisional hardening </S>",
    "<S> _ increases _ with increasing @xmath2 and orbital period , while that due to gravitational radiation has the opposite trend , so that their interplay leads to a characteristic scaling of the total hardening rate with gc parameters . in our introductory treatment of this effect here , we have given very simple formulations of many physical processes . </S>",
    "<S> first , collisional hardening is an inherently stochastic process , wherein individual events of varying sizes accumulate to yield a final state , and the shull ( 1979 ) rate we have used is a continuous approximation to it . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the essential two- and three - body interactions that determine the evolution and fate of a pxb in a gc are also stochastic by nature . </S>",
    "<S> for example , approximating an ionization event  in which a binary is disrupted  by a continuous term is necessarily a great oversimplification . </S>",
    "<S> thus , an improved treatment must include a proper formulation of these stochastic processes , which we are developing currently .    </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , we have confined ourselves to circular orbits here , while binaries created by tidal capture and/or exchange interactions often have quite eccentric orbits , in which tidal circularization must play a dominant role during initial phases of hardening . </S>",
    "<S> fourthly , mass segregation is an essential effect in gcs , which reflects itself in the accumulation of the heaviest objects in the core of a gc , and so in a change in the effective mass - function in the core . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the evolution of the gc must be taken into account in a realistic calculation : this would make the gc parameters time - dependent , while we have treated them as constants here , and may indeed have a large effect if core collapse and bounce are modelled .    </S>",
    "<S> the above processes will need to be adequately modelled in a realistic calculation of the evolution of pxbs and xbs in gcs . </S>",
    "<S> such calculations are under way , and the results will be reported elsewhere .    * </S>",
