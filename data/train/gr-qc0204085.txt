    "an exact solution of einstein s equations is known @xcite@xcite which describes a snapping cosmic string .",
    "the string is represented by minkowski space minus a wedge , the deficit angle representing a string of constant tension . at some event ,",
    "the string snaps and the two ends move apart at the speed of light .",
    "this generates an impulsive spherical gravitational wave , inside which the minkowski space is complete ( i.e. there is no string ) .",
    "it has recently been argued @xcite that this solution may be considered as the impulsive limit of the robinson ",
    "trautman family of type  n solutions @xcite in spite of the fact that , in a convenient coordinate system , the metric in this impulsive limit includes the product of two delta distributions .",
    "this interpretation is here confirmed by investigating the physical interpretation of a sandwich wave constructed from a particular member of this family of solutions .",
    "specifically , we present a particular robinson  trautman solution in which the gravitational wave is non - zero only for a finite interval .",
    "it is well known that these waves have spherical wavefronts . behind the wave , in this case ,",
    "is an expanding spherical region of minkowski space .",
    "however , ahead of the spherical shock front , the minkowski space contains a cosmic string . in the robinson  trautman interval , there is also a topological singularity in which the initial deficit angle reduces uniformly to zero through the wave .",
    "this solution is therefore interpreted as describing a cosmic string which , rather than snapping , disintegrates to zero in a finite time , and in which the regions of disintegration propagate along the string with the speed of light .",
    "the robinson  trautman solutions of petrov type n ( which are necessarily vacuum ) with zero cosmological constant are given by the line element @xmath0\\d u^2 -2{r^2\\over p^2}\\,\\d\\zeta\\,\\d\\bar\\zeta .",
    "\\label{rtmetric}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 can be interpreted as the gaussian curvature of the 2-surfaces @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is a solution of the equation @xmath4 a general solution of this equation can be expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an arbitrary complex function of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , holomorphic in @xmath8 .",
    "also , it is always possible to use a coordinate transformation to put  @xmath9 .",
    "finally , it can be shown that , using a natural tetrad , the only remaining component of the weyl tensor is given by @xmath10_{\\zeta }   = { p^2\\over2r}f_\\zeta   \\left[{1\\over f_\\zeta}\\big(\\log f_\\zeta\\big)_{u\\zeta}\\right]_\\zeta.\\ ] ] these solutions always contain singular points on each wave surface , forming singular lines , but these are generally not well understood .",
    "we will concentrate here on the case in which  @xmath11 ,  and first consider the minkowski background . in this case",
    ", we can put  @xmath12 ,  which is then a stereographic coordinate .",
    "putting  @xmath13  and  @xmath14 ,  the metric ( [ rtmetric ] ) takes the form @xmath15 from which it is clear that the wave surfaces @xmath16 const .",
    "are expanding concentric spheres .",
    "let us also consider a family of solutions in which  @xmath17 ,  where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants .",
    "this represents an expanding gravitational wave with amplitude proportional to @xmath19 . on any wave surface  @xmath16  const .",
    ", @xmath20 represents the stereographic coordinate .",
    "however , if @xmath21 ,  @xmath22 includes an excess angle of  @xmath23 .",
    "let us now use the above solution with @xmath11 to construct a sandwich gravitational wave .",
    "first , let us take the region inside some expanding circle  @xmath24  to be part of minkowski space ( [ minksp ] ) .",
    "this is a particular case of the robinson  trautman metric ( [ rtmetric ] ) with  @xmath12  and @xmath21 .",
    "then , let us consider a robinson  trautman wave in the region  @xmath25  with  @xmath17 ,  as shown in figure  1 . in this case",
    ", @xmath26 represents the duration of the wave . in order for the solution to be continuous at  @xmath24 ,",
    "it is necessary that  @xmath27 .",
    "finally , let us consider the region ahead of the wave , in which  @xmath28 ,  also to be part of minkowski space .",
    "for this to be continuous on the wavefront  @xmath29 ,  it is necessary that this region is represented by the metric ( [ rtmetric ] ) with @xmath30 .",
    "according to the above calculation , it can be seen that this part of minkowski space has a deficit angle given by @xmath31 .",
    "as described above , we have constructed a very simple sandwich robinson  trautman wave by putting @xmath32 with  @xmath21 .",
    "this wave is of type  n for  @xmath25 with @xmath33 which is unbounded at both poles ( @xmath34 ) representing the continuations of the strings through the gravitational wave region .",
    "this solution represents a snapping cosmic string in a minkowski background in which the tension ( deficit angle ) of the string reduces uniformly to zero over a finite interval of retarded time .",
    "this decay of the cosmic string may be considered to generate the gravitational wave .",
    "the above solution is obviously not complete in the sense that the disintegration of the string does not follow from field equations and initial data .",
    "moreover , the solution above does not contain its own time reverse , as this would include a region in which the ingoing and outgoing waves would interact .",
    "however , if some external reason is given for a string to break , the above solution could describe its subsequent development .",
    "similar solutions can easily be constructed .",
    "for example , @xmath19 could be negative , and a string could occur behind the wave rather than in front of it .",
    "also , a string could be generated and then destroyed , although for this , the energies associated with the string and the wave would need to be explained . in general it is known that , for a robinson  trautman type  n solution , some singularities must occur due to the nature of the holomorphic function @xmath35 .",
    "the above example shows that these singularities may be associated with string - like structures . the development or decay of such structures may be considered to generate the waves , but this should really be associated with a complete theory for the string .    as well as describing an interesting physical situation , the above solution appears to give some insight into the character of the singularities that are known to occur in robinson ",
    "trautman type  n solutions .",
    "further , since this solution clearly reduces to the known solution for a snapping string with an impulsive gravitational wave in the limit as  @xmath36 ,  while @xmath37 remains finite , this also confirms the interpretation of the impulsive robinson ",
