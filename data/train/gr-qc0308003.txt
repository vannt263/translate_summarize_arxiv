    "one of the most promising sources of gravitational radiation that can be detected by the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite is the capture of a compact object by a supermassive black hole . in the extreme mass - ratio limit",
    "this problem can be solved using perturbation theory , in which the compact object ( e.g. , a stellar mass black hole or a neutron star ) is treated as a test particle moving on the fixed background of the central , supermassive black hole .    a test particle , in the absence of self interaction and internal structure , moves along a geodesic of the spacetime background . when the particle s mass is much smaller than the typical length scale of the curvature of the background spacetime , it is useful to use perturbation theory . the particle s mass ( or charge , if any ) contributes to the spacetime curvature , such that the particle moves along a geodesic of a perturbed spacetime .",
    "( these perturbation fields can be interpreted as those of free gravitational waves , which are produced by the particle at retarded times .",
    "these perturbations are smooth on the particle s worldline @xcite . ) alternatively , the particle can be construed as moving along an accelerated , nongeodesic trajectory of the unperturbed background spacetime : let the mass of the companion compact object be @xmath0 , and the mass of the central black hole be @xmath1 , such that @xmath2 .",
    "the particle s acceleration at order @xmath0 is driven by forces at order @xmath3 imparted on the particle . to obtain the corrected orbit of the particle",
    "[ to @xmath4 one needs to include _ all _ the forces , at @xmath5 , which act on the particle .",
    "two sources can contribute forces at @xmath5 : i ) the particle s self force @xcite , and ii ) the particle s spin angular momentum : when the companion of a central black hole is a black hole of mass @xmath0 , the latter carries spin angular momentum @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "( neutron stars also have maximal spin angular momentum which is quadratic in their mass @xcite . )",
    "the force imparted on the particle is at order @xmath3 , which endows the particle acceleration at order @xmath0 .",
    "numerous authors have considered the orbital evolution under either self force effects @xcite or spin effects @xcite .",
    "however , in order to obtain the particle s orbit to order @xmath0 , one needs to include both the self interaction and the spin effects .",
    "the relative importance of the two contributing effects can be evaluated using an order - of magnitude estimate for @xmath8 .",
    "the component of the self - force responsible for the decay of the orbit ( dissipation , `` radiation reaction '' ) scales like @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the particle s spin angular momentum to the decay of the orbit can be found from the papapetrou equation .",
    "specifically , an order - of magnitude estimate for the spin force can be found from the fact that it is linear in the particle s spin , linear in the spacetime curvature , and quadratic in the particle s four - velocity .",
    "( one needs to be careful here , because the various components of the four - velocity scale differently in @xmath10 .",
    "specifically , @xmath11 , whereas @xmath12  see below . ) taking the typical curvature to scale as @xmath13 , and the typical velocity of a particle in a quasi - circular orbit to be given by kepler s law , one expects the contribution of the spin force to dissipation to scale as @xmath14 .",
    "consequently , we expect the decay of the orbit to be dominated by the radiation reaction , with only small corrections ( which we neglect ) due to the particle s spin angular momentum .",
    "the situation is much different when one considers the conservative correction to the orbit at @xmath15 .",
    "the component of the self force contributing to the conservative effect scales like @xmath16 , whereas the component of the spin force contributing to the conservative effect scales like @xmath17 .",
    "( see below the justification for these scaling laws . )",
    "both forces are at @xmath5 , but because of the slower drop off with @xmath10 , naively one might expect the spin force under these conditions to be much more important than the self force . in a strict sense , however , a direct comparison of the spin force and the self force tells us only little about the relative importance of the two forces .",
    "the reason is that the self force is gauge - dependent .",
    "in particular , one can always choose a gauge in which the self force vanishes .",
    "consequently , the scaling law used above is not unambiguous , at least as long as we do not specify the gauge in which it is written .",
    "a useful way to compare the spin force and the self force then is to compare between gauge-_independent _ quantities .",
    "the generated waveform or the number of cycles that the system spends in a logarithmic interval of frequency are two such quantities . in practice",
    "we evolve a quasi - circular , equatorial orbit around a schwarzschild black hole using both forces , or either one , and compare these gauge - independent quantities .",
    "[ an initially equatorial orbit will remain nearly equatorial because the total angular momentum is conserved , and the spin angular momentum is much smaller than the orbital angular momentum . specifically , the spin angular momentum is at @xmath5 , such that its rate of change is at @xmath18 .",
    "conservation of total angular momentum imply that changes in the orbital angular momentum are also at @xmath18 , whereas the orbital angular momentum itself is at @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , changes in the direction of the spin vector imply only very small changes in the direction of the orbital angular momentum , or very small changes in the orbital plane @xcite . ]",
    "indeed , we find that our naive expectations are realized : the conservative effect is controlled by the spin force , which overwhelms the self force .",
    "more general orbits around a kerr black hole will include also dissipation due to the spin force and spin - spin coupling .",
    "here , we ignore such effects , and focus on the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "our motivation is that for such a simplified orbit we can already demonstrate our main point : spin forces for astrophysical systems may be much more important than the self forces , as far as conservative effects on the orbital evolution are concerned .    in particular , we find that neglecting the local , conservative self force in the construction of templates may introduce only a small error in the astronomical determination of the parameters of the system .",
    "specifically , we can match a template made without the local self force almost exactly to a waveform which does include the local , conservative self force , but with a slightly different value for the spin of the companion .    in a more general system",
    ", the component of the spin force which induces the conservative effect also contributes to dissipation . consider a kerr black hole in boyer - lindquist coordinates .",
    "the rates of change of the particle s energy , @xmath19 , and angular momentum ( in the direction of the spin axis ) , @xmath20 , can be found from the fluxes of energy and angular momentum to infinity and through the central black hole s event horizon .",
    "the rate of change of carter s constant , @xmath21 , however , can not be found using balance arguments and global conservations laws , because @xmath22 is non - additive . to find @xmath21 one needs to find first the local forces which act on the particle . specifically , @xmath23 where @xmath24 are certain ( known ) functions of the constants of motion ( com ) in the absence of dissipation , and the metric @xmath25 @xcite , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 being the spin parameter of the black hole . to have a full description of dissipation",
    "then , one needs the _ total _ radial force , @xmath28 , which acts on the particle .",
    "similarly to our argument above , we expect the contribution to @xmath21 due to the self force to be small compared with the contribution of the spin force .    as generically the companion is expected to spin ( and even spin fast ) , we propose that a reasonable approximation for the orbital evolution of a spinning particle can be found without finding first the local self force .",
    "specifically , we propose that a practical way to obtain the orbital evolution ( and the waveforms ) to high accuracy could be the following : first , find @xmath29 using the fluxes to infinity and down the event horizon of the central black hole .",
    "next , find @xmath21 using @xmath29 and the _ spin _ contributions to @xmath28 .",
    "undoubtedly , that will introduce an error in the determination of @xmath21 .",
    "however , because of the smallness of the radial component of the self force with respect to the radial component of the spin force , we believe that this may be a useful approximation for the total @xmath21 . to find the orbital evolution one needs also to include conservative effects @xcite .",
    "again , we propose to neglect the contribution of the self force to the conservative effects , and approximate the full conservative effect by the conservative effect due to the spin force .    in the simple problem we consider here the motion is quasi - circular and equatorial around a schwarzschild black hole , such that the spin angular momentum of the companion is aligned ( or anti - aligned ) with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "it is not hard to let the central black hole be spinning  with the spin axis pointing along the same direction as the companion s spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum  and include also spin - spin coupling effects .",
    "we are hoping to return to that problem in the future .",
    "we note , that when the spins are not aligned as in our assumptions , the precession of the particle s spin will induce a changing quadrupole moment , such that the spin force will cause a strong dissipative effect .",
    "the implications of such a spin dissipative effect are beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "our goal in this paper is more to point out that the accurate determination of the local self force may perhaps be less crucial for determination of the orbital evolution of extreme mass - ratio binaries than previously thought , than to give a definite prediction .",
    "first , some companions may have only little spin angular momentum , in which case one would no longer be justified in neglecting the local self force .",
    "second , and most importantly , our analysis in what follows is incomplete , in the sense that some of the necessary pieces of information for carrying out the comparison of the spin and self force effects are as yet unknown .",
    "we consequently make a number of assumptions , that allow us to obtain what we believe to be at least a reasonable order - of - magnitude estimate for the effect of interest .",
    "we emphasize that our analysis is based on a number of assumptions , which are as yet unproven .",
    "we believe that our main conclusion  namely , that spin - orbit coupling may overwhelm the conservative self force effect  is insensitive to the accuracy of these assumptions and is robust . at three places",
    "our assumptions are speculative ( see below for details ) : first , we assume that the terms linear in second - order forces in the expression for the second - order radial velocity are small compared with terms quadratic in first - order forces .",
    "second , we assume that finite - mass effects in the luminosity in gravitational waves , which are small in the weak field regime , are small also in the strong field regime .",
    "third , we assume that the radial component of the gravitational self force is proportional to its scalar field counterpart , with a specific proportionality constant . of these three assumptions ,",
    "the last one is the easiest to test .",
    "when this is done , the actual gravitational self force can be used to replace the assumed expression ( [ fr - grav ] ) .",
    "while these assumptions appear to be quite natural to make , they are by no means guaranteed to be justified under all circumstances .",
    "however , even if any of them turns out to be incorrect , the implications on our main point in this paper are not expected to be strong .",
    "we therefore believe that our results are at least reasonable order - of - magnitude estimates , and that our main point is relevant for realistic extreme mass - ratio binaries .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we describe the equations of motion and derive the equations for a quasi - circular , equatorial orbit with aligned spins , using the papapetrou equations and linearizing in the spin covector .",
    "appendix [ app - eq ] includes more details on the definitions of the spin force and the local self force . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we derive the perturbative solution for the equations of motion following the method of ref .",
    "@xcite ( paper i ) , but with slightly different definitions and notation , which will make the generalization to a kerr black hole simple .",
    "then , we discuss the domain of validity of the solution . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we describe the computation of the evolved orbit and the number of cycles that the system spends in a logarithmic interval of frequency .",
    "next , in section [ sec5 ] we discuss the modeling of the self force .",
    "first , we discuss the fitting of the numerically - derived luminosity in gravitational waves to a smooth function using a match to two different asymptotic expansions , and discuss the associated errors , and then we discuss our conjecture for the as - yet undetermined ( radial component of the ) self force .",
    "finally , in section [ sec6 ] , we compute the orbit and the waveforms , and discuss the relative importance of the spin force and the self force .",
    "the total force which acts on the particle at order @xmath3 is just the sum of the well known spin force and the self force .",
    "the deviation of the orbit from the geodesic because of the spin force is at order @xmath0 .",
    "its effect on the self force is therefore at order @xmath30 , and hence negligible , as we are interested here in the forces only at order @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , the deviation of the orbit from the geodesic because of the self force is also at order @xmath0 , such that its effect on the spin force is again negligible .",
    "it is clear then , that the total force , at order @xmath3 , which acts on the particle and pushes it off the geodesic is just the sum of the self force and the spin force .",
    "specifically , the equations of motion for a particle of mass @xmath0 , whose center of mass travels along the worldline @xmath31 with four - velocity @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 the expressions we use for @xmath34 and @xmath35 are given in appendix [ app - eq ] .        the line element , in the usual schwarzschild coordinates ,",
    "is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "( notice , that the form of the papapetrou equations of motion depends on the choice of signature . )    in general , the spin covector precesses along the motion , and the orbit is not planar . in particular , with arbitrary alignment of the spin covector , an otherwise equatorial motion will no longer be equatorial . to facilitate the analysis ,",
    "let us specialize to a particular solution of the papapetrou equations , in which the entire motion is on the equatorial plane . under the requirement that the entire motion is equatorial , eq .",
    "( [ pt ] ) for the parallel transport of the spin covector becomes very simple .",
    "specifically , eq .  ( [ pt ] ) becomes @xmath39 which implies that @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , @xmath42 being a constant .",
    "notice that the magnitude of the spin vector then is @xmath43 , such that @xmath42 satisfies @xmath44 for black holes .",
    "equation ( [ papapetrou ] ) then becomes @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 notice that the last equation indeed satisfies the requirement for equatorial motion .",
    "the equations of motion ( [ eqm_t])([eqm_theta ] ) can be interpreted as an external force , which is given by their rhs , acting on the particle and pushing it off the geodesic .",
    "this spin force joins the self force , as they are both at order @xmath3 .",
    "the equations of motion simplify even further for the case of quasi - circular orbits . for such orbits",
    "the radial motion is perturbatively small , i.e. , the radial velocity is at order @xmath0 .",
    "that is the case when an initially circular orbit damps under radiation - reaction effects . keeping terms on the rhs of eqs .",
    "( [ eqm_t])([eqm_theta ] ) to order @xmath3 , we find that the only remaining component of the spin force is the radial component .",
    "the spin force we use then is given by @xmath49 we thus find that to order @xmath3 , the only contribution to the temporal component of the total force comes from the self force : dissipation is controlled by radiation reaction .",
    "the conservative effects , however , have contributions ( via the radial force ) from both the self force and the spin force [ as they are both at @xmath5 ] .",
    "in fact , we find that the spin contribution to the radial force is typically much larger than the self force contribution . we shall study their relative importance in detail below .",

    "the explicit perturbative solution of the eom is listed in appendix b.    we remark that we express all quantities here as functions of @xmath81 . for other purposes , e.g. , for analysis of detected signals , it is frequently more convenient to express quantities as functions of @xmath61 .",

    "one should therefore view eq .",
    "( [ v2 ] ) as a formal expression . however , we propose that the expression for @xmath85 is dominated by the terms quadratic in @xmath83 , such that neglecting the terms involving @xmath84 introduces only a small error : consider the @xmath86 components of the four - acceleration and the four - force .",
    "expand the four - acceleration as @xmath87 where @xmath88 is at order @xmath89 .",
