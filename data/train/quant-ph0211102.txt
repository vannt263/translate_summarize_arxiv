    "radiation pressure is a classical effect which is however at the basis of laser cooling and of many techniques for the manipulation of quantum states of atoms .",
    "its classical origin however naturally suggests to extend its application to a more macroscopic level .",
    "in fact , a number of recent papers @xcite have shown how radiation pressure can be profitably used to cool macroscopic degrees of freedom as , for example , the vibrational modes of a mirror of an optical cavity .",
    "the possibility to use optomechanical coupling to cool a cavity mirror in conjunction with a phase - sensitive feedback loop was first pointed out in ref .",
    "the optomechanical coupling allows one to detect the mirror displacement through a homodyne measurement , and then the output photocurrent can be fed - back in such a way to realize a real - time reduction of the mirror thermal fluctuations . the scheme proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite roughly amounts to a continuous version of the stochastic cooling technique used in accelerators @xcite .",
    "in fact , feedback continuously `` kicks '' the mirror in order to put it in its equilibrium position , and for this reason the feedback scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite has been called `` stochastic cooling feedback '' in @xcite .",
    "however there are important differences with the scheme used in accelerators and its natural extension in the case of atomic clouds @xcite .",
    "a significant improvement has been then achieved with the first experimental realization @xcite of the feedback cooling scheme .",
    "the experiment however employed a slightly different feedback scheme , the so called `` cold damping '' technique which was already known in the study of classical electro - mechanical systems @xcite .",
    "cold damping amounts to applying a viscous feedback force to the oscillating mirror . in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , the displacement of the mirror is measured with very high sensitivity , and the obtained information is fed back to the mirror via the radiation pressure of another , intensity - modulated , laser beam , incident on the back of the mirror .    the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite has been performed at room temperature , where the effects of quantum noise are blurred by thermal noise and all the results can be well explained in classical terms ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , developing a fully quantum description of the system in the presence of feedback is of fundamental importance , for two main reasons .",
    "first of all it allows one to establish the conditions under which the effects of quantum noise in optomechanical systems become visible and experimentally detectable .",
    "for example , ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that there is an appreciable difference between the classical and quantum description of feedback already at liquid he temperatures . moreover",
    ", a completely quantum treatment allows one to establish the ultimate limits of the proposed feedback schemes , as for example , the possibility to reach ground state cooling of a mechanical , macroscopic degree of freedom .",
    "quantum limits of feedback cooling have been already discussed in @xcite , where the possibility to reach ground state cooling has been shown for both schemes . here",
    "we shall review these results and make a detailed comparison of the cooling capabilities of the two different schemes .",
    "morever , the present paper will extend the results of @xcite for what concerns the possibility to achieve new nonclassical effects in the presence of feedback .",
    "in particular we shall see that optomechanical cooling allows purely quantum effects , as squeezing and entanglement , to come out also in macroscopic mechanical oscillators .",
    "the experimental realization of these quantum limits in optomechanical systems is extremely difficult , but the feedback methods described in this paper may be useful also for microelectromechanical systems , where the search for quantum effects in mechanical systems is also very active @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the model and derive the appropriate quantum langevin equations . in sec .",
    "iii we describe both feedback schemes using the quantum langevin theory developed in @xcite . in section iv we analyze the stationary state of the system , and we determine the cooling capabilities of both schemes .",
    "section v is devoted to the various nonclassical effects that can be achieved with the feedback scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , while section vi is for concluding remarks .",
    "we shall consider two examples of optomechanical systems , a fabry - perot cavity with an oscillating end mirror ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for a schematic description ) , and a ring cavity with two oscillating mirrors ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "these kind of optomechanical systems are used in high sensitivity measurements , as the interferometric detection of gravitational waves @xcite , and in atomic force microscopes @xcite .",
    "their ultimate sensitivity is determined by the quantum fluctuations , and therefore each movable mirror has to be described as a single _ quantum _ mechanical harmonic oscillator with mass @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the mirror motion is the result of the excitation of many vibrational modes , including internal acoustic modes .",
    "the description of a movable mirror as a single oscillator is however a good approximation when frequencies are limited to a bandwidth including a single mechanical resonance , by using for example a bandpass filter in the detection loop @xcite .    the optomechanical coupling between the mirror and the cavity field is realized by the radiation pressure .",
    "the electromagnetic field exerts a force on a movable mirror which is proportional to the intensity of the field , which , at the same time , is phase - shifted by an amount proportional to the mirror displacement from its equilibrium position . in the adiabatic limit",
    "in which the mirror frequency is much smaller than the cavity free spectral range , one can focus on one cavity mode only , say of frequency @xmath2 , because photon scattering into other modes can be neglected @xcite .",
    "moreover , in this adiabatic regime , the generation of photons due to the casimir effect , and also retardation and doppler effects are completely negligible @xcite .    since we shall focus on the quantum and thermal noise of the system",
    ", we shall neglect all the technical sources of noise , i.e. , we shall assume that the driving laser is stabilized in intensity and frequency . including these supplementary noise sources is however quite straightforward and a detailed calculation of their effect is shown in ref .",
    "moreover recent experiments have shown that classical laser noise can be made negligible in the relevant frequency range @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of an optomechanical system is also influenced by the dissipative interaction with external degrees of freedom .",
    "the cavity mode is damped due to the photon leakage through the mirrors which couple the cavity mode with the continuum of the outside electromagnetic modes .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the movable mirrors have perfect reflectivity and that transmission takes place through a `` fixed '' mirror only .",
    "each mechanical oscillator , which may represent not only the center - of - mass degree of freedom of the mirror , but also a torsional degree of freedom as in @xcite , or an internal acoustic mode as in @xcite , undergoes brownian motion caused by the uncontrolled coupling with other internal and external modes at thermal equilibrium .",

    "the symmetric correlation function becomes proportional to a dirac delta function when the high temperature limit @xmath26 first , and the infinite frequency cutoff limit @xmath27 later , are taken .",
    "it is only in this limit that the _ exact _ qle ( [ qlenl1])-([qlenl3 ] ) reduce to the standard ones @xcite .",
    "the quantum langevin description given by eqs .",
    "( [ qlenl1])-([qlenl3 ] ) is more general than that associated with a master equation approach , which needs a high temperature assumption @xcite .    in standard applications",
    "the driving field is very intense so that the system is characterized by a semiclassical steady state with the internal cavity mode in a coherent state @xmath28 , and a new equilibrium position for the mirror , displaced by @xmath29 with respect to that with no driving field .",
    "the steady state amplitude @xmath30 is given by the solution of the classical nonlinear equation @xmath31 . in this case , the dynamics is well described by linearizing the qle ( [ qlenl1])-([qlenl3 ] ) around the steady state . redefining with @xmath32 and @xmath33 the quantum fluctuations around the classical steady state , introducing the field phase @xmath34 and field amplitude @xmath35 , and choosing the resulting cavity mode detuning @xmath36 ( by properly tuning the driving field frequency @xmath37 ) ,",
    "the linearized qles can be rewritten as @xmath38 where we have introduced the phase input noise @xmath39 and the amplitude input noise @xmath40 .",
    "similar arguments can be used to describe the dynamics of the ring cavity scheme with two movable mirrors of fig .  2 .",
    "assuming for simplicity that the two movable mirrors are identical ( i.e. , equal mass , frequency and damping ) , and since the two mirrors are perfectly reflecting , one can easily extend the qles for the fabry - perot cavity ( [ qlenl1])-([qlenl3 ] ) to the optomechanical system of fig .  2 , and get ( in the interaction picture with respect to @xmath15 ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 are the dimensionless position and momentum operators of the movable mirrors m1 and m2 , with @xmath45=(i/2)\\delta_{kj}$ ] , and @xmath46 is the new coupling constant , ( @xmath14 now represents the equilibrium distance between the movable mirrors , as well as the distance between the fixed mirrors , see fig",

    "it is evident from these equations that only the relative motion of the two mrrors is coupled to the radiation field , while the center of mass undergoes a simple brownian motion .",

    "this capability to achieve quantum squeezing can be exploited to get a third interesting and somewhat unexpected nonclassical effect , i.e. , the possibility to have an _ entangled _ stationary state of the two movable mirrors in the ring cavity scheme of fig .",
    "this entangled state corresponds to a squeezed state of the relative motion of the two mirrors , in which their positions are strongly correlated .",
    "such a squeezing could be obtained by applying the feedback scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite to the relative motion of the mirror , which amounts to apply a continuous position shift to both mirror ( see fig .",

    "the key point is that in the present model , the feedback - induced entanglement is achieved for the full stationary state , integrated over all frequencies , and is not limited to a small bandwidth in the frequency domain .",
    "this is a much stronger effect , and it is not surprising that it is much more difficult to achieve .",

    "we have analysed and compared the momentum feedback scheme introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the cold damping scheme of @xcite .",
    "the main effect of feedback is the increase of mechanical damping , accompanied by the introduction of a controllable , measurement - induced , noise .",
    "the increase of damping means reduction of the susceptibility at resonance , and the consequent suppression of the resonance peak in the noise spectrum .",
    "we have then shown the possibility to achieve the ultimate quantum limit of ground state cooling with both feedback schemes .",
    "cold damping is more suitable for cooling than momentum feedback because its capabilities are not influenced by the mechanical quality factor of the oscillators @xmath130 .",
    "instead momentum feedback requires a very large @xmath130 , and in this limit it tends to coincide with cold damping .",
    "however , for fixed @xmath130 and for very large feedback gain ( and input powers ) , the steady state in the presence of momentum feedback shows unexpected nonclassical features .",
    "in fact , it can become a position squeezed , or contractive state .",
    "moreover , applying momentum feedback to the relative motion of two movable mirrors of a ring cavity , one can even get an entangled stationary state of the two mirrors , again in the limit of very large feedback gains and input powers .",
    "both ground state cooling and nonclassical effects are achieved in a parameter region which is extremely difficult to achieve with present day technology .",
