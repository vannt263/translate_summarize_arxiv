    "therefore , it is interesting to consider why no lae candidates are found at @xmath1 5.8 5.9 .",
    "for laes at @xmath107 , both the ly@xmath0 emission and the very weak continuum depressed at wavelengths shortward of the ly@xmath0 peak are recorded in the _ ia827 _   image .",

    "contours of the local surface density are also shown in this figure .",
    "the local surface density at position ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) is the density averaged over the circle centered at ( @xmath112 , @xmath113 ) whose radius is determined as the angular distance to 5 nearest neighbors .",
    "note that smoothing with the top - hat filter of @xmath114 arcmin , corresponding to @xmath115 mpc at @xmath116 , is made .",
    "the contour map suggests that there is a high - density region in northwest side of the quasar , where the local density is higher by a factor of 3 than the average density in this field . to examine its statistical significance ,",
    "we made simple simulations ; we distributed 21 points randomly in the survey field and estimated the local surface density at each point .",
    "we found that 19 % of 100 random distributions also show a similar high - density region .",
