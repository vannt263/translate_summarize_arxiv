    "experiment has shown that some micelles adsorb strongly onto polymer chains .",
    "if the polymer molecule is large enough many micelles can adsorb onto one molecule , forming a necklace of micelles along the polymer chain .",
    "the most widely studied example is the adsorption of micelles of sodium dodecyl sulphate ( sds ) onto poly(ethylene oxide ) ( peo ) , see refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "@xcite for work on other systems .",
    "the interaction energy of a micelle with a polymer chain can be strong , many times @xmath0 the thermal energy , and has a large effect on both the polymer and the micelle .",
    "the favourable interaction of a micelle with the polymer reduces the surfactant density at which the micelles form ; the critical micellar concentration ( cmc ) is reduced . whilst if many micelles adsorb onto a single polymer the repulsive micelle ",
    "micelle interactions cause the polymer chain to swell ; the radius of gyration may increase by a factor of two .",
    "below , we propose a simple minimal model for necklaces of micelles adsorbed on a polymer chain .",
    "we then go on to calculate the free energy of such a necklace and use this to determine when they form and to look at the competition between free micelles and micelles bound to polymer .",
    "a polymer chain is a linear object , its topological dimension is 1 @xcite .",
    "so , two micelles adsorbed onto a chain can not pass each other without one of them detaching from the polymer chain .",
    "therefore the necklace of micelles along a polymer chain behaves as a 1-dimensional system . in the limit",
    "that the polymer molecule is very long the necklace is a 1-d bulk fluid .",
    "we assume that the micelle ",
    "micelle interactions are repulsive and so no two micelles can approach each other closely .",
    "this restriction on the relative positions of the micelles of the necklace restricts the configurations the polymer can adopt and so reduces its entropy . at high density of micelles",
    "the micelles are closely spaced along the polymer , that is the pieces of polymer between the micelles are quite short , and so these short pieces of polymer have to stretch in order to bridge the gaps between the micelles .",
    "this loss of entropy eventually limits the number of micelles which adsorb on a polymer and when the polymer chains are saturated with micelles , free micelles are formed .    in the next section",
    "we derive from first principles a theory of objects with excluded volume interactions , which are adsorbed onto a linear polymer .",
    "this is the our main result , our results are not qualitatively new .",
    "they are however , semiquantitative , unlike previous work which was more qualitative.@xcite first , the polymer - mediated interaction between two micelles is derived , yielding a potential of mean force for the intermicellar interaction .",
    "then this is combined with a theory of 1-dimensional fluids to provide the equation of state of particles adsorbed onto a polymer .",
    "this is then used in section iii to calculate the equation of state of a necklace .",
    "combining the equation of state with a standard theory of micelle formation @xcite then allows us to calculate how many micelles will form , both absorbed on polymer and free , as a function of the surfactant density .",
    "finally , we discuss possible extensions of the theory and model .",
    "the system is a mixture of surfactant and polymer in a common solvent ; the mixture is dilute , i.e. , the fraction of the volume taken up by the surfactant and polymer is small .",
    "the polymer is composed of coils of size @xmath1 , where @xmath1 is proportional to the number of monomers of a polymer molecule @xcite .",
    "the coils are ideal , gaussian , coils and if unperturbed the mean square distance between the two ends of a coil equals @xmath1 .",
    "thus @xmath1 has dimensions of length squared , and @xmath2 is the single relevant length scale for the polymer @xcite .",
    "we are assuming that the polymer s kuhn length is much smaller than any length we consider explicitly .",
    "our theory is entirely mesoscopic : the micelle is treated simply as a sphere and the polymer ",
    "micelle interaction is not considered explicitly but is treated phenomenologically via an association constant .",
    "this constant @xmath3 is the difference in excess chemical potential between a micelle bound to a piece of a polymer chain and a free micelle . here",
    ", excess means the chemical potential minus its ideal gas part : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the ( 1- or 3-d ) density .",
    "if @xmath3 is negative the micelles will tend to adsorb on the chain @xcite .",
    "this adsorption is due to part of the polymer chain lying near the surface of the micelle and interacting via an attractive interaction with it @xcite .",
    "however , for simplicity we treat the polymer  micelle interaction as that between the micelle and a point on the polymer ; we ignore the amount of polymer taken up in adsorbing to the micelle . with this simplification",
    "a micelle adsorbed onto a polymer coil is free to move along the entire length of the polymer @xmath1 . as the polymer is a 1-dimensional ( 1-d ) chain of monomers the micelle acts as a particle on a wire .",
    "even though the polymer is tracing out a an extremely convoluted path through 3-d space the configurational space available to a micelle adsorbed onto the polymer is only 1-d .",
    "if there is more than one micelle adsorbed on the same polymer coil then the micelles will interact with each other .",
    "we model the micelle ",
    "micelle interaction via a simple hard - sphere interaction : no two micelles centres may be within a distance @xmath6 of each other .",
    "the size of the micelles , @xmath6 , is much less than that of a coil , @xmath2 , allowing many micelles to adsorb onto one coil . above",
    ", we assumed that the polymer ",
    "micelle adsorption was pointlike , i.e. , a negligible amount of the polymer is adsorbs on a micelle and we have just assumed that two micelles interact with each other out to a distance @xmath6 .",
    "for these two assumptions to be consistent the physical size of the micelles must be much smaller than the range at which two micelles interact .",
    "essentially , we must have a micelle of diameter @xmath7 which is quite highly charged so that no other micelle can approach within @xmath6 @xcite . as micelles are typically 34 nm in diameter , @xmath8 nm .",
    "the limit of few micelles adsorbed onto a polymer chain , when micelle ",
    "micelle interactions are unimportant , is trivial ( at our phenomenological level of description ) .",
    "it is just the free energy of a polymer coil plus the excess free energy of a free micelle plus @xmath3 plus the log of the 1-d density of micelles on the chain .",
    "the first of these is a reference free energy , which we need not specify , and the free energy of a free micelle and @xmath3 are parameters of our model .",
    "however , at higher densities micelles on the same coil interact .",
    "they do so when the micelles are close together , i.e. , when the pieces of polymer which connect adjacent micelles are short .",
    "the partition function of a piece of polymer chain with a micelle at each end is different from the partition function of the same length of chain without the micelles . in evaluating the partition function when the micelles are present",
    ", we must exclude those configurations in which the two micelles hard spheres overlap .",
    "this is done in the following section and in section iia we use that result to calculate the thermodynamic functions for a necklace of micelles in the limit that the coil is infinitely long . in iib",
    "this result is used to determine free energy of a necklace at any density .",
    "we consider two micelles adsorbed onto a coil and separated by a length of polymer @xmath9 .",
    "the probability of this separation of the micelles is proportional to the partition function of the chain at this separation .",
    "the two micelles have split the coil into 3 pieces , the one between them of length @xmath9 and the two end pieces .",
    "the three parts are independent as the coil is ideal .",
    "only the partition function of the centre piece is affected by the micelles ; the end pieces are free to adopt any configuration but the the ends of the centre piece are each attached to a micelle and so , because of the micelle ",
    "micelle interaction , they must be at least @xmath6 apart . the partition function of a chain of length @xmath9",
    "whose ends are constrained to be at least @xmath6 apart is easy to calculate .",
    "the partition function for a chain with ends separated by @xmath10 divided by its partition function when free , is just the probability distribution function @xmath11 for the ends of an unconstrained chain , times @xmath12 .",
    "now , @xmath11 is @xcite @xmath13 thus , the partition function with the ends at least @xmath6 apart , divided by the partition function for an unconstrained chain is simply @xmath14 .",
    "\\label{wdef}\\ ] ] the seond equality defines @xmath15 the effective interaction potential between two neighbouring micelles . the probability of the micelles being @xmath9 apart , @xmath16 , is directly related to the partition function of the chain when the micelles are @xmath9 apart , @xmath17}{\\int\\exp[-w(l_{12}/d^2)]dl_{12}},\\ ] ] for an infinitely long or ring polymer .",
    "we see that @xmath18 $ ] is acting as a boltzmann weight and so @xmath15 is an effective interaction ; it is plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the interaction @xmath15 is an athermal but soft repulsion .",
    "when two micelles are bound to the polymer less then @xmath19 apart along a polymer chain then the chain has to stretch to cross the distance between the micelles , which must be @xmath20 .",
    "conventionally , the boltzmann weight is the exponential of minus an energy of interaction but here it is the exponential of minus the free energy of the piece of polymer coil .",
    "however , despite its unusual origin @xmath15 behaves just as an interaction energy .",
    "the pair of micelles behave as a pair of particles on a wire which interact via a potential @xmath15 . in the following section we use @xmath15 to obtain the thermodynamic functions of a fluid of many micelles on one polymer coil .",
    "when many micelles are adsorbed onto the same coil they behave as a 1-d fluid .",
    "formally we will take the @xmath21 limit , producing an infinite fluid .",
    "we do not consider effects due to the finite size of the polymer coils .",
    "each micelle s movement is restricted by the micelle in front and the micelle behind . as the system is",
    "effectively 1-d the micelles form a fluid at all densities ; they never solidify or undergo a liquid ",
    "vapour transition @xcite .",
    "due to the convoluted path taken by the chain non - adjacent micelles can interact , indeed this interaction will cause the coil to swell and change from being gaussian to being swollen @xcite .",
    "however , these interactions are weak in comparison to the interactions between nearest neighbour micelles and so will be neglected for the purpose of determining the free energy of the necklace of micelles",
    ". each micelle always interacts with the micelles in front and behind it but collisions between different parts of the chain are relatively infrequent @xcite .",
    "therefore we have a simple 1-d fluid . as the interaction between micelles",
    "is mediated via the polymer chain the interaction is strictly nearest neighbour .",
    "the free energy of the coil is simply a sum of the free energies of the pieces between the micelles and so is just a function of all the @xmath9 s between neighbouring micelles .",
    "the statistical mechanics of 1-d fluids with nearest neighbour interactions is both well - studied and simple @xcite .",
    "we start from the canonical partition function @xmath22 of @xmath23 micelles on a coil of length @xmath1 . as usual for 1-d systems , molecules fixed at each end of the system define its limits .",
    "so , with a micelle fixed at coordinate @xmath24 and one at @xmath25 , @xmath26 is @xmath27,\\ ] ] where the factor of @xmath28 is absent because we have put the micelles into a sequence : the @xmath29th micelle is always the left - hand neighbour of the @xmath30th micelle @xcite .",
    "the units are defined so that the thermal energy @xmath0 is unity .",
    "progress can be made if we move to the isothermal - isobaric ensemble @xcite ; introducing the pressure @xmath31 which is the conjugate variable to the length @xmath1 .",

    "the density @xmath42 is obtained from @xmath43 using eq .",
    "( [ wdef ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ mu1d ] ) and then eq . ( [ rho1d ] )",
    "yields @xmath38 as a function of density @xmath42 ; it is plotted in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "notice that the chemical potential is almost a linear function of density at high density .",
    "for future use we define an excess chemical potential @xmath44 .",
    "we now possess the chemical potential of a necklace of micelles as a function of the density of micelles along the polymer chain . in order to determine the density of micelles along a polymer as a function of surfactant density we require a model for the formation of micelles .",
    "our model for micelle formation is quite standard @xcite .",
    "we start by assuming that the surfactant monomers , the free micelles , and the micelles bound to polymer coils form an ideal ternary mixture .",
    "the only interactions considered are those between micelles bound to the same polymer ; interactions involving free micelles or monomers are neglected as the surfactant + polymer solution is dilute . the ternary mixture s density and composition are specified by three densities : the density of surfactant monomers @xmath45 , of free micelles @xmath46 , and of bound micelles @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the numbers of surfactant monomers , free micelles and micelles bound to polymer , respectively , and @xmath51 is the volume .",
    "the 1-d density of micelles along the polymer chains @xmath42 is related to the density of bound micelles in the mixture @xmath52 by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a ` segment ' density of the polymer .",
    "it is the number density of segments of polymer of size @xmath55 , times @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath57 is the number of polymer coils .",
    "below , we treat the monomers and free micelles , and the micelles bound to polymer as constituting two different bulk phases .",
    "the polymer density @xmath58 just defines the relative volumes of these two parts of our system .    at equilibrium",
    "the chemical potential of a surfactant is the same if it is a monomer or is part of either type of micelle .",
    "then the chemical potential of a micelle composed of @xmath59 surfactant molecules is @xmath59 times that of a monomer . for the chemical potential of a monomer to be equal to that in a free micelle @xcite @xmath60 and for it to equal that in a bound micelle @xmath61 where we used eq .",
    "( [ 1d3d ] ) to go from the middle to the right hand side expression .",
    "we have assumed that the number of surfactant molecules in a micelle is @xmath59 for both free and bound micelles .",
    "micelles are of course not monodisperse and so this is an approximation , although the numbers of micelles much larger or smaller than the most probable size is small @xcite .",
    "the constants @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the contributions to the chemical potentials of the monomers and micelles , respectively , of the interaction with the solvent .",
    "they are the change in free energy in excess of the @xmath4 term , of the system when a monomer or a micelle is inserted @xcite .",
    "we have neglected the contribution from the momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , @xmath64 is the difference between the chemical potential ( minus the @xmath4 terms ) of @xmath59 surfactant molecules in a micelle and @xmath59 surfactant monomers .",
    "the first equation for equilibrium between monomers and micelles , eq .",
    "( [ mueq1 ] ) , is easily rewritten in the familiar form @xmath65 the most convenient thermodynamic variable to work in is @xmath66 which corresponds to controlling the chemical potential of the surfactant : @xmath67 . the second equation for equilibrium , eq .",
    "( [ mueq2 ] ) , can not be rewritten in the form @xmath52 equals a function of @xmath66 because the the right hand side includes @xmath38 which is not a simple logarithmic or linear function of @xmath52 .",
    "if @xmath58 , @xmath63 and @xmath3 are specified , then eq . ( [ mueq2 ] ) can be solved as a non - linear equation for @xmath52 , at any value of @xmath66 .",
    "the total number density of surfactant is proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "as all three of the densities @xmath66 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are made dimensionless by multiplying by @xmath56 , the volume fraction of the surfactant is approximately equal to @xmath5 times the physical volume of a micelle divided by @xmath56 .",
    "the physical volume of a micelle is the volume actually occupied by the surfactant molecules .",
    "as the physical volume is much less than @xmath56 the surfactant s volume fraction is much less than @xmath5 . in figs .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) and ( [ fig5 ] ) we plot the densities of monomers and micelles as a function of this total surfactant density . in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) we have no polymer and there are only free micelles .",
    "the critical micellar concentration ( cmc ) @xcite is clearly around @xmath71 , although it is not that well defined as our aggregation number @xmath59 is not that large , @xmath72 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) , the value of @xmath63 is unchanged from fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) but there is polymer present . as @xmath3 is negative the polymer stabilises the micelles .",
    "this has two effects : micelles form at lower densities , the polymer encourages micelle formation , and micelles prefer to be adsorbed onto a polymer than to be free .",
    "so , at low densities where there are few micelles they are nearly all adsorbed onto polymer chains ; the density of free micelles is very low below @xmath73 .",
    "as the density of micelles increases the density of micelles on the polymer chains becomes quite high and the interaction free energy of these micelles , @xmath74 , is large . the polymer chains are stretching to accommodate the micelles and this stretching is reducing the configurational entropy of the polymer .",
    "this reduces the free energy reduction on adsorption and so we see that free micelles start to form . from eqs .",
    "( [ mueq1 ] ) and ( [ mueq2 ] ) , it is easy to see that when @xmath75 the numbers of free and bound micelles are the same .",
    "notice that the density of surfactant at which free micelles appear is much higher in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) than in fig ( [ fig4 ] ) because the monomer density is depleted by the formation of bound micelles .",
    "free micelles appear at a @xmath66 determined solely by @xmath63 , see eq .",
    "( [ rhofm ] ) , but this corresponds to a higher @xmath5 if there is competition for monomers . the @xmath66 curve of fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) looks as if there are two cmc s ; it has two steps while in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) it has only one .",
    "the first is where bound micelles form and the rate of increase of @xmath66 decreases sharply .",
    "then as the density of bound micelles increases the polymer chains become crowded , micelle formation becomes less favourable , and the rate of increase of @xmath66 increases .",
    "at yet higher density , free micelles form and the rate of increase of @xmath66 decreases again . of course",
    ", if the polymer density @xmath58 increases then the polymer chains saturate at higher surfactant densities and the second ` cmc ' is pushed to higher values of @xmath5 .",
    "the formation of a necklace of micelles causes the ideal polymer coil to expand for two reasons : it stretches the pieces of the polymer chain between the micelles and the micelle ",
    "micelle interaction results in the chain being swollen , like a polymer coil in a good solvent @xcite . without micelles the radius of gyration of the polymer @xmath76 . at low densities of micelles ,",
    "@xmath77 the radius of gyration is difficult to estimate as the micelles cover only a fraction of the chain .",
    "therefore some parts , with micelles , repel each other but other , bare , parts do not .",
    "however , for @xmath78 almost all the chain is covered with micelles . in order to minimise the stretching of the polymer the spacing between the micelles",
    "will be quite regular and near @xmath6 .",
    "so , we can consider the chain as being composed of @xmath79 segments of length @xmath80 .",
    "then as the chain is swollen @xmath81 .",
    "as @xmath82 this is much larger than @xmath2 .",
    "perhaps the simplest possible model of polymer coils with necklaces of micelles has been proposed and studied . the simplicity of the model has allowed a detailed examination of its behaviour with only very minor approximations .",
    "this differs from previous theoretical work @xcite which involved a highly approximate treatment of a much more detailed , and so complex , model .",
    "we have shown that the 1-d topology @xcite of a polymer chain implies that the necklace behaves as a 1-d fluid .",
    "this allowed us to determine the behaviour of the necklace using the highly developed theory for 1-d systems @xcite . in combination with a standard theory for",
    "micelle formation it was then straightforward to calculate the densities of micelles formed , see fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the model was kept simple for the sake of simplicity and clarity . for the purposes of comparison with experiment a more complex and accurate model",
    "is required . the theory presented here",
    "can be extended to deal with the most unrealistic features of the model .",
    "for example , the theory neglects the finite size of the polymer coils .",
    "micelles are quite large , @xmath83 nm across , and so if the polymer coil is small there may be room for only a few micelles to adsorb without stretching the polymer so much that it is not favourable to adsorb another micelle .",
    "then the fluid of micelles is not a bulk fluid .",
    "the finite size of the coil corresponds to a 1-d fluid between two walls , @xmath1 apart",
    ". confined 1-d fluids have been considered extensively , see ref .",
    "the coils studied in experiment @xcite are in a good solvent and so are swollen",
    ". therefore it would be worthwhile to extend our theory for ideal coils to self - avoiding coils .",
    "although self - avoiding coils are more complex and difficult to deal with than ideal coils @xcite , enough is known about their free energy when they are stretched @xcite to perform at least a scaling theory of a polymer with a micellar necklace .",
    "experimental results @xcite on a semidilute solution of polymer clearly show the competition between polymer entropy and the free energy of adsorption which we have observed here .",
    "we hope that the theory developed here can be applied even to this system .",
    "it is a pleasure to acknowledge a careful reading of the manuscript by j. doye .",
    "i would like to thank the royal society for the award of a fellowship and the fom institute amolf for its hospitality .",
