    "the study of the motion of many particles inside a biological cell is a problem with many degrees of freedom and a large parameter space .",
    "the latter may include the different diffusion constants of the different species , velocities along microtubules , their number , the geometry of cell and nucleus , the number and sizes of nuclear pores , the various degradation factors , and so on .",
    "the experimental and numerical exploration of this multi - dimensional parameter space is limited perforce to a small part thereof , due to the great complexity of the biological cell . a great reduction in complexity",
    "is often achieved by coarse - graining the complex motion by means of effective equations and their explicit analytical solutions , which is the approach we adopt in this letter .",
    "we are specifically concerned with finding a concise description of virus and plasmid trafficking in the cell cytoplasm .",
    "early vesicle trafficking studies revealed the complex secretion pathways @xcite , whereas much more recent studies of natural ( viruses ) @xcite and synthetic ( amphiphiles ) dna carriers @xcite uncover details of the cellular pathways and the complexity of cellular infection .",
    "viruses invade mammalian cells through multistep processes , which begin with the uptake of particles , cytoplasmic trafficking , and nuclear import of the dna .",
    "however , cytoplasmic trafficking remains a major obstacle to gene delivery , because the cytosolic motion of large dna molecules is limited by physical and chemical barriers of the crowded cytoplasm @xcite .",
    "whereas molecules smaller than 500kda can diffuse , larger cargos such as viruses or non - viral dna particles , require an active transport system @xcite .",
    "viral infection is much more efficient than gene transfer using polymers- or lipids - based vectors , where a large amount of endocytozed dna ( typically over 100.000 copies of the gene ) is required to produce a cellular response , while only a few copies seem to be necessary in the case of viruses .",
    "two recent studies @xcite showed that microtubules shape the distribution of molecular motors and vesicle trafficking inside the cell cytoplasm by means of a combination of experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "the mean concentration of viral species was analyzed in @xcite by means of the mass - action law .",
    "the mechanism of dna transport in the cytoplasm , however , is still an open question .",
    "we propose here a coarse - grained reduced description of viral trafficking and compare it to plasmid diffusion .",
    "specifically , we are interested in the probability @xmath0 and the mean time @xmath1 for a dna carrier or a virus to get from the cell membrane to a small nuclear pore .",
    "the evaluation of these quantities calls for a quantitative approach to the description of particle trajectories at an individual level and also , to quantify the role of the cell organization and the signaling processes involved in viral infection .",
    "we start with the observations that a viral movement can be described as a combination of intermittent switches between pure brownian diffusion and active transport along microtubules ( figure [ figure1 ] ) , while dna motion can be characterized as pure brownian",
    ". we also account for multiple factors involved in degradations , such as hydrolyzation , destruction in lysosomes , or any other factors that prevent irreversibly the particle from reaching a nuclear pore .",
    "this degradation process is modeled as killing with a time - independent rate @xmath2 .",
    "we use the overdamped langevin dynamics with killing to describe the viral or dna motion and use fokker - planck - type equations to obtain asymptotic approximations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the limit of large and small @xmath2 .",
    "we compute the mean time the first among many independent viruses reaches a small nuclear pore . brownian",
    "simulations confirm the validity of the analytical analysis .",
    "the present approach is a first attempt to develop a theoretical tool for the analysis of virus dynamics and , hopefully , for the study of trafficking of synthetic vectors , a necessary step toward gene delivery .    * modeling viral or dna trajectories * we model viral trajectories as a collection of pieces , each of which is characterized either as directed movement along microtubules or pure brownian motion @xcite .",
    "in contrast , dna motion in the cytoplasm can be adequately described as pure brownian motion @xcite .",
    "particles moving inside the cell are reflected at impermeable surfaces and are absorbed at nuclear pores .",
    "a virus travels on microtubules as long as it binds to * a * motor .",
    "the three- or two - dimensional position of a particle , @xmath3 , is described by the coarse - grained stochastic dynamics @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a @xmath6-correlated standard white noise and @xmath7 is a time - dependent velocity along a microtubule .",
    "the velocity @xmath7 can be either positive or negative , depending on whether a viral particle binds to a dynein or to a kinesin motor .",
    "however , it is not clear what regulatory mechanisms is involved in such a choice @xcite .",
    "* mathematical description of a viral trajectory in the cytoplasm .",
    "* we consider the trafficking of a viral particle from an endosome or the cell membrane to a small nuclear pore .",
    "the cell cytosol is a bounded spatial domain @xmath8 , whose boundary @xmath9 is the external membrane @xmath10 and the nuclear envelope .",
    "most of the nuclear membrane consists of a reflecting boundary @xmath11 , except for small nuclear pores @xmath12 , where a viral particle can enter the nucleus .",
    "we assume that a viral particle that reaches a pore is instantly absorbed , so that this boundary is purely absorbing for trajectories .",
    "the ratio of the surface areas is assumed small , @xmath13 * homogenization of viral trajectory . * to replace the intermittent dynamics between free diffusion and the drift motion along microtubules * , * described in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) , we use the precise calibration procedure described in @xcite . in this homogenization procedure , the motion is described by the overdamped limit of the langevin equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the diffusion constant and @xmath16 represents the steady state drift . because all microtubules starting from the cell surface converge to the centrosome , a specialized organelle located nearby the cell nucleus ( figure [ figure1 ] ) , we choose in the first approximation a radially symmetric effective drift @xmath16 converging to the nucleus .",
    "this approximation can be justified by the study @xcite , where viral trajectories move around the nucleus surface .",
    "although viruses move bidirectionally on microtubules , the overall movement is directed toward the nucleus , thus we only consider here this average motion @xcite .",
    "the homogenized drift in ( [ eq2 ] ) becomes @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constant amplitude , which depends on many parameters , such as the density of microtubules , the binding and unbinding rates and the averaged velocity of the directed motion along microtubules @xcite .",
    "* from trajectory description to the probability and mean arrival time .",
    "* * v*iral killing , immobilization or rejection out of the cell and naked dna degradation by nucleases , are coarse - grained into a steady state killing rate @xmath2 .",
    "to derive asymptotic expressions for the probability @xmath19 , that a dna carrier ( single virus or dna ) arrives to a small nuclear pore alive and for the mean time @xmath1 , we use the approximation ( [ smallnp ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic estimates depend on the diffusion constant @xmath15 , the amplitude of the drift @xmath18 , and @xmath2 .",
    "these computations are based on the small hole theory @xcite , which describes a brownian particle confined to a bounded domain by a reflecting boundary , except for a small absorbing window , through which it escapes .",
    "the domain @xmath8 contains a spherical nucleus of small radius @xmath6 .",
    "the survival probability density function ( spdf ) @xmath20 to find the virus or naked dna alive inside the volume element @xmath21 at time @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the first passage time of a live dna carrier to the absorbing boundary @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the first time it is hydrolyzed , and @xmath27 is the initial distribution .",
    "the spdf @xmath20 of the motion ( [ eq2 ] ) is the solution of the mixed initial boundary value problem for the fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the unit outer normal at a boundary point @xmath30 .",
    "the flux density vector @xmath31 is defined as @xmath32 the probability @xmath19 that a live dna carrier arrives at the nucleus is @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this probability can be expressed in terms of the spdf @xcite by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the solution of equation @xmath36q with the boundary conditions ( [ boundary - c2 ] ) . using the pdf of the time to absorption , conditioned on the event that the dna carrier escapes alive @xmath37",
    ", we define the conditional mean time to absorption as @xmath38 = \\int_0^\\infty { ( 1-\\pr\\{\\tau^a < t\\,|\\,\\tau^a<\\tau^k)}\\,dt .",

    "* to obtain explicit expression for @xmath19 and @xmath1 for a nucleus containing @xmath42 well separated small holes ( nuclear pores ) on its surface , we consider first a killing rate @xmath2 smaller than the diffusion constant @xmath15 .",
    "the asymptotic analysis for naked dna @xmath43 leads to @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the radius of a small absorbing disk .",
    "formula ( [ tau - ff ] ) does not depend on the specific shape of the killing rate @xmath2 , but rather on its integral .",
    "we compare this asymptotic formula with brownian simulations obtained for parameters @xmath47 ; @xmath48 ; @xmath49 ; @xmath50 @xcite ; @xmath51 @xcite ; @xmath52 ( a single big hole ) .",
    "this simulation corresponds to a cell with @xmath53 of the nuclear surface occupied by a large nuclear pore , or equivalently , to a simulation with @xmath54 pores of radius @xmath55@xcite . because formula ( [ tau - ff ] ) depends only on the product @xmath56 ,",
    "both simulations give the same result .",
    "when @xmath57 is much larger compared to diffusion , a boundary layer analysis leads to the asymptotic expression @xmath58 where we assume that the smooth killing rate is a constant @xmath59 in the neighborhood of the nuclear surface . *",
    "asymptotic expressions : the virus case .",
    "* for a virus trajectory governed by equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , with a constant scalar drift @xmath18 , the leading order term of the probability and the mean time are given by @xcite @xmath60 these asymptotic formulas show that the main contribution to the probability and the mean time comes from a boundary layer located near the nucleus surface .",
    "the killing rate @xmath2 in this case is the averaged value of the killing field in that boundary layer @xcite . in figure",
    "[ figure2 ] , we compare the probability to arrive alive at the pore and the mean arrival time for several values of the drift and the constant killing rate .        for a large number of microtubules , the drift @xmath18 equals the apparent velocity @xcite ( @xmath61 @xcite of the minus end velocity , approximatively equal to @xmath62 @xcite ) .",
    "using formula ( [ tau - fff ] ) , we can now predict the effect of changing the effective drift @xmath63 by @xmath64 : increasing the drift leads to a probability @xmath65 and a mean time @xmath66 , while reducing the drift gives @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we conclude that decreasing the drift increases the time by @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) and decreases the probability by @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , while increasing the drift , reduces the time by @xmath73 and increases the probability by @xmath61 .",
    "these results show the nonlinear effect of the drift . in a biological context , decreasing the drift can be implemented by disrupting the microtubule network .",
