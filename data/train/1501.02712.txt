    "making connections between high - energy ( hard ) and low - energy ( soft ) models of hadrons , that is between the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and effective theories of strong interactions working in the infrared limit , is one of the major challenges of modern particle theory .",
    "the electromagnetic form factor of the charged @xmath0 meson , @xmath1 , represents a particularly interesting observable in this context . on one hand , its high - energy asymptotics",
    "is well defined within the perturbative qcd  @xcite . on the other hand , precise experimental data in the soft region",
    "allow to directly trace the evolution of the observable with the momentum transfer , @xmath2 , up to @xmath3  gev@xmath4 , that is close to the range where one expects the hard behavior to start settling down .",
    "the @xmath1 form factor is remarkable in one more aspect which we will exploit here .",
    "it is probably the only observable for which a successful low - energy theory exists which gives the correct qcd asymptotics quantitatively without a dedicated parameter tuning  @xcite .",
    "the soft / hard transition is governed by switching the constituent - quark mass @xmath5 off in the model , and wherever the mass is switched off , the qcd asymptotics settles down , provided the low - energy description works well .",
    "therefore , no additional parameters are required to be tuned to reproduce quantitatively the qcd asymptotics .",
    "the model uses the @xmath6 dependence as an input , and various ways of switching the mass off are allowed , just because the asymptotics is universal and is determined by the infrared , and not intermediate - scale , parameters .",
    "therefore , the model , in its present form , does not predict the energy scale at which the soft / hard transition , that is switching @xmath6 off , takes place ; this scale is to be determined either by a detailed model for @xmath6 or experimentally . unfortunately , detailed models for the @xmath5 running available in the literature contain a number of free parameters and can hardly be used for this purpose . here , we explore prospects for experimental determination of this scale from future @xmath1 measurements .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we briefly review the model for the pion form factor which gives the correct qcd asymptotics starting from the low - energy physics . in sec .",
    "[ sec : constraints ] , we describe how the unknown ingredient of the model , the dependence of the effective constituent - quark mass on @xmath2 , is constrained . we proceed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] with estimates of the impact future data may have on these constraints , working within two representative scenarios ; then we briefly conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "we adopt a well - elaborated model for the pion form factor  @xcite originally developed as a low - energy theory based on the poincar invariant constituent - quark model .",
    "it exploits the instant form of relativistic hamiltonian dynamics ( see e.g.ref .",
    "the use of the modified impulse approximation  @xcite provides for the full relativistic invariance and eliminates certain drawbacks of the original instant form .",
    "the pion form factor , @xmath7 , is given by rather cumbersome but explicit expressions  @xcite collected in ref .",
    "@xcite , which we do not quote here .",
    "the low - energy model has two free parameters , the constituent - quark mass @xmath5 and the wave - function confinement scale @xmath8 ( the actual choice of the wave function does not have any significant effect on the result , see refs .",
    "these two parameters are tuned to reproduce correct experimental values of the pion decay constant @xmath9 and of the pion charge radius .",
    "it is remarkable that these parameters were fixed from the low - energy data ( actually in 1998 , ref .",
    "@xcite , by making use of the @xmath7 measurements at @xmath10  gev@xmath4  @xcite ) , so no room to tune them remained .",
    "the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite have been subsequently verified by new measurements of @xmath7 up to @xmath11  gev@xmath4 , an order of magnitude higher , and are in excellent agreement with all present - day data .    in parallel with this phenomenological success , the model has an interesting , if not miraculous , theoretical advantage .",
    "it has been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that the asymptotical behavior @xmath12 , predicted by qcd  @xcite , is obtained in this model at @xmath13 .",
    "this is however not a full story : introducing explicit @xmath6 dependence in such a way that @xmath14 is taken from the original model but @xmath15 , we obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite the numerical coefficient of this asymptotics which appeared to reproduce the qcd predictions quantitatively , without any parameter tuning , for every possible way of switching the quark mass off .",
    "the qcd asymptotics  @xcite is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the one - loop qcd coupling constant ( extension to higher loops is not straightforward , see e.g.refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : * ] ) is determined by two parameters , @xmath9 ( determined in the low - energy theory ) and the qcd scale @xmath18 ( which is related , though not explicitly , to the low - energy confinement parameter @xmath8 ) .",
    "the fact that , by fixing @xmath19 and the charge radius in the low - energy theory , we immediately reproduce eq .",
    "( [ eq : * ] ) quantitatively , is an important advantage of the model , not seen in other approaches .",
    "the idea of switching the constituent - quark mass @xmath5 off in order to obtain the form - factor behaviour at high @xmath2 was put forward in ref .",
    "@xcite in the frameworks of the light - front approach @xcite ; however , eq .  ( [ eq : * ] )",
    "was not obtained there . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we used a parametrization for @xmath6 inspired by ref .",
    "@xcite but corrected for effects of a one - gluon exchange , @xmath20 @xmath21 the soft / hard transition is therefore governed by two parameters , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , of the @xmath6 function .",

    "the boundary value @xmath25 while @xmath26  gev is fixed , like in previous studies , to reproduce @xmath9 and the pion charge radius correctly .",
    "we note that the parametrization ( [ eq:5 * ] ) , ( [ eq:5 * * ] ) describes well the @xmath6 dependence obtained , within certain assumptions about free parameters , in complicated non - perturbative dynamical models  @xcite , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details and illustrations .    to summarize this section",
    ", we have a predictive quantitative model for the pion form factor whose low - energy parameters are fixed and determine the correct high - energy asymptotics automatically , but the soft / hard transition is parametrized by @xmath6 , that is by two parameters @xmath27 .",
    "we turn now to constraining these parameters .",
    "we start with theoretical constraints which are determined by the limits of applicability of the model .",
    "while , technically , eq .  ( [ eq:5 * ] ) implies that @xmath5 is always decreasing for arbitrary @xmath22 and @xmath23 , it appears that it can not decrease too slow .",
    "indeed , for each fixed @xmath2 , there exists a value @xmath28 beyond which the form factor , considered as a function of @xmath5 , ceases to be monotonic .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the form factor as a function of @xmath2 may cease to be monotonically decreasing .",
    "we calculate this @xmath28 numerically and determine , from the requirement @xmath29 , the corresponding restriction on the parameters @xmath27 .",
    "this bound ( `` the consistency limit '' ) , applicable in any case , is presented in fig .",

    "the corresponding bound on @xmath6 is obtained from the requirement of agreement , at the 95% confidence level ( cl ) , of the corresponding @xmath7 function with the data points , tested by means of the ususal chi - square method . for demonstration purposes",

    "@xcite ; the values of @xmath2 for these fake `` measurements '' are also taken from there .",

    "[ fig : plot-6gev2 ] that the expected error bars of the @xmath1 measurements exceed the width of the region allowed by the present data for our model .",
    "therefore , these data are not expected to contribute much into the determination of the soft / hard transition scale , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : mu - lambda ] in terms of @xmath45 .",
    "however , we point out that the 12-gev jlab data will be of crucial importance for testing the model itself . in fig .  [",
    "fig : plot-6gev2 ] , predictions of two alternative scenarios describing soft / hard transitions are also shown ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "clearly , the precision of the expected 12-gev jlab data would be sufficient to confirm or exclude the model we use here .",
    "contrary , the 5-gev eic data , though having large expected error bars , will be able to disentangle the low - scale and high - scale transition scenarios within our approach , see figs .",
    "[ fig : mu - lambda ] , [ fig : plot-15gev2 ] .",
    "the 95% cl constraints obtained in the two example scenarios are clearly separated .",
    "there still remains a formal degeneracy for @xmath46  gev@xmath4 , but this range of momentum transfer , with the energy scale of order the @xmath8-quark mass , most probably corresponds to the perturbative qcd regime anyway .",
    "we considered the effect of future experimental data on our understanding of the dependence of the pion electromagnetic form factor , @xmath1 , on the momentum transfer squared , @xmath2 , paying a special attention to the `` soft / hard '' transition region where the qcd asymptotics should settle down .",
    "we took advantage of a particular low - energy model which describes excellently the existing data and predicts the qcd asymptotics automatically , without parameter tuning .",
    "given the estimated precision of 12-gev jlab and of eic , as well as the expected range of the momentum transfer accessible to the instruments , we conclude that the coming jlab data may confirm or exclude our model while the eic measurements would be able to pin down the soft / hard transition scale .",
