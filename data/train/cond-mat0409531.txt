    "semiconducting clathrate compounds are attracting considerable attention because of their potential applications in thermoelectrics.@xcite these compounds consist of face - shared polyhedral cages ( formed by si , ge , sn , and/or ga ) filled with alkali - metal , alkaline - earth and/or rare - earth atoms .",
    "the most pronounced feature of clathrate compounds is their very low lattice thermal conductivity @xmath16(@xmath17 1w / m k at room temperature ) .",
    "some compounds even show glasslike temperature - dependent thermal conductivity , although they crystallize in well - defined structures .",
    "these classes of compound are good candidates to fulfill the phonon glass electron crystals ( pgecs ) concept,@xcite which is a guideline to search for high performance thermoelectric materials with the compatibility of low thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity .",
    "the thermoelectric performance of a material at a given operation temperature @xmath18 is characterized by the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath19 , which is defined as @xmath19=@xmath20 ) , where @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath21 are the thermoelectric power , electrical resistivity , and electronic thermal conductivity of the material , respectively .",
    "a higher energy conversion efficiency demands a large @xmath19 .",
    "however , @xmath19 has been limited to unity for several decades although much effort has been made to increase it .    recently , within the spirit of pgec concept , open structured compounds such as filled skutterudites and clathrates have been extensively investigated due to their low @xmath16 , which leads to a much - enhanced @xmath19.@xcite the reduction of thermal conductivity for these compounds is believed resultant from the local vibrations ( rattling ) of the guest atoms encapsulated in oversized cages .",
    "the heat - carrying phonons are scattered effectively by the rattling of these guest atoms .",
    "however , the mechanisms responsible for some clathrate compounds showing glasslike @xmath4(t ) at low temperatures remain an open issue . based on the experimental results of neutron scattering and ultrasonic attenuation on single crystals of @xmath22ga@xmath6ge@xmath7(@xmath23 = ba , sr ,",
    "eu),@xcite it was concluded that the scattering of phonons from tunneling states is responsible for the glasslike @xmath4(t ) of ( sr / eu)@xmath5ga@xmath6ge@xmath7 in addition to the scattering from the rattling guest atoms .",
    "the absence of glasslike @xmath24 for the @xmath10-type ba@xmath5ga@xmath6ge@xmath7 sample was attributed to a very low density of tunneling states , if any . on the other hand ,",
    "et al_.@xcite recently reported a glasslike @xmath4(t ) of a ga - rich @xmath25-type ba@xmath5ga@xmath6ge@xmath7 .",
    "they discussed the difference in thermal conductivity between the two types of samples and pointed out that glasslike @xmath24 of ( ba / sr / eu)@xmath5ga@xmath6ge@xmath7 at low temperatures ( @xmath26 15 k ) is determined by scattering of phonons on charge carriers .",
    "most recently , bridges and downward proposed another possible mechanism for the glasslike @xmath24 of clathrates.@xcite they argued that off - center displacement of guest atoms is crucial for understanding the glasslike behavior in @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , it is important to investigate the origin of the glasslike @xmath24 in clathrate compounds using single crystals to exclude effects of other factors , such as scattering at grain boundaries . the existence of large number of clathrate compounds and the amenability of their framework supply opportunities for us to bring the issue to a close , and to find high performance thermoelectric materials among them .",
    "until today , most of the work on clathrate compounds has been focusing on type - i clathrates of silicon,@xcite germanium,@xcite and tin.@xcite in this paper , we present a comprehensive study on single crystals of ba@xmath5ga@xmath6sn@xmath7 , which crystallizes in the type- clathrate structure ( sg : _",

    "we were motivated to investigate the title compound in detail by the few reports on it in literature with a scattering of lattice parameters , different melting behaviors , and promising thermoelectric properties .",

    "then , it was cooled to room temperature in two steps : fast cooled to 720 k at first and kept at this temperature for 12 hours , then slowly cooled down to room temperature .",
    "the well - shaped crystals of 10 mm in diameter with a shiny metallic luster were separated from the molten sn solvent by centrifuging .",
    "the crystals are not sensitive to air and moisture .",
    "polished surfaces of the crystals were examined by the use of optical microscopy and laue x - ray reflection to confirm their homogeneous single - crystal nature .",
    "the composition of the crystals was examined by electron probe microanalysis ( epma ) with a jeol jxa-8200 microanalyzer . the same result with a composition of ba@xmath5ga@xmath34sn@xmath35",
    "was obtained on several crystals , which is nearly the ideal stoichiometric composition .",
    "because carrillo - cabrera _ et al_.@xcite suggested a positive thermoelectric power of a ga - rich sample in a short report , we have tried to grow crystals in ga - flux with initial atomic ratio of ba : ga : sn = 8:38:30 .",
    "however , we obtained the stoichiometric crystals again , so the stoichiometric compound seems to be very stable .",
    "the structure was refined with a rigaku r - axis diffractometer and with synchrotron radiation powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) from 100 to 390 k. the powder xrd experiment was carried out by using a large debye - scherrer camera installed at beam line bl02b2 , spring-8 , japan .",
    "the wavelength of the incident x - ray was 0.735  .",
    "differential thermal analysis ( dta ) was performed from room temperature to 1200 k with ruthenium as a standard .",
    "the electrical resistivity ( thermoelectric power ) was measured with a homemade cryostat from 3 ( 5 ) to 300 k , and measured from 100 to 500 k ( 550 k ) with a commercial mmr measurement system .",
    "the data obtained with the two systems are in good agreement in the overlapped temperature range .",
    "the hall coefficient was measured under a magnetic field of 1 tesla from 4 to 300 k. thermal conductivity was measured with a steady - state method from 1.5 to 150 k with a homemade cryostat .",
    "the measurements of specific heat were carried out from 2 to 300 k with a ppms ( quantum design ) .",

    "it was reported at first that ba@xmath5ga@xmath6sn@xmath7 melts congruently at 723 k,@xcite whereas , kuznetsov _",
    "et al_.@xcite observed an incongruent melting behavior with a decomposition temperature of 740 k and liquidus temperature of 784 k. in order to check which is the case , a dta measurement was carried out on our small single crystals .",
    "figure 1 shows the heating and cooling dta curves .",
    "the double peaks on the heating curve indicate an incongruent melting nature of this compound . however , we observed a decomposition temperature of 784 k and liquidus temperature of 1038 k , which are higher than those reported in ref.16 .",

    ", there is a normal thermal contraction , but no change in structure was observed .",
