    "silicene , a two dimensional honeycomb lattice of silicon atoms , had been recently synthesized   @xcite and been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies  @xcite . unlike carbon atoms in graphene , silicon atoms in silicene",
    "tends to adopt the tetrahedral sp@xmath0 hybridization over sp@xmath1 which results in a slightly buckled structure of silicene  @xcite where , sublattices @xmath2 and @xmath3 atoms are displaced from each other in the out - of - plane direction with a distance @xmath4 .",
    "silicene is predicted to be more stable when is buckled or corrugated rather than to be a perfectly planar one  @xcite and the low - energy excitations exhibit the dirac - type dispersion with small gap due to a relatively large spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) ( 3.9 mev )  @xcite .",
    "the large soc originates from the buckled nature that relates to the sp@xmath1/sp@xmath0 mixed hybridization .",
    "the stronger soc in si than in c ( a thousand times larger )  @xcite leads to a quantum spin hall insulator which is experimentally accessible  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a rashba term also appears in a model , however this term has a negligible effect on the dispersion and can be safely neglected  @xcite .",
    "buckled structure of silicene makes it possible to control its band dispersion using an external out - of - plane electric field . in this scheme ,",
    "the on - site energies of different sublattices are no longer equivalent and thus the spin up and down bands are separated  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , a transition from a topological insulator state to a band insulator is predicated by increasing the strength of the electric field  @xcite .",
    "silicene offers the potential for a widely application such as chiral superconductor  @xcite , giant magnetoresistance  @xcite , various exotic field - dependent states and the field effect transistor operating at room temperature by a growth - transfer - fabrication process  @xcite .",
    "ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction  @xcite is an indirect exchange interaction between two magnetic impurities mediated by a background of conduction electrons of the host material and is a fundamental quantity of research .",
    "rkky interaction is a vital interaction plays a significant role in the magnetic ordering of many electronic systems including spin glasses and alloys .",
    "as it was originally studied for three - dimensional electron gas , it has also been studied for electron gas in one  @xcite and two  @xcite dimensions .",
    "two main features of the long - range behavior of the interaction , measured by exchange integral , @xmath5 , for an electron gas is that it oscillates ( in sign and magnitude ) with the distance , @xmath6 , between the moments , which exhibits ferromagnetic ( fm ) or anti - ferromagnetic ( afm ) ordering and also decays  @xcite with @xmath6 .",
    "both of these features have different functional forms depending on the dimension and generally , on the energy dispersion of the host material .",
    "the rkky interaction has extensively been studied for single layer  @xcite and bilayer graphene  @xcite . for an undoped single layer graphene where the fermi energy vanishes , two main features are agreed upon , first , unlike an ordinary 2d metal with @xmath7 decay in the long - distance limit , the rkky inetraction in undoped graphene falls off as @xmath8 and shows the @xmath9$]-type oscillations with additional phase factors  @xcite depending on the direction of @xmath10 , and second , the moments on the same sublattice exhibit an fm interaction and an afm coupling if placed on the opposite sublattices , as required by the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the rkky interaction for doped graphene shows a long - range behavior similar to that of ordinary 2d electron gas with another oscillatory factor emerging from the dirac cones  @xcite .",
    "while silicene is a cousin of graphene , there are notable and important differences between the two materials and it would be worthwhile investigating the rkky interaction in silicene .",
    "it was previously shown that the rkky interaction contains a heisenberg and ising type interactions in spin polarized graphene  @xcite .",
    "the ising and heisenberg terms of the rkky interaction make the magnetic moment of impurities to be collinear .",
    "however , the rashba or dresselhaus terms lead to a dzyalosinsky - moriya(dm ) term which causes a rotation between the spinors of the magnetic impurities .",
    "this phenomenon was shown to be appeared in three dimensional topological insulators  @xcite as well as a two - dimensional electron gas with the rashba term  @xcite .",
    "it has been also shown that  @xcite dm term can be appeared in a monolayer of molybdenum disulfide where there is no longer the rashba term .",
    "in addition , the existence of the dm interaction has been reported for a bulk silicene  @xcite and the authors mentioned that the dm interaction exhibits no qualitative difference in the topological or band insulator regime for an undoped case .    in this paper , by using the spectral lehmann representation  @xcite of the retarded green function ,",
    "we present the derivation of the rkky interaction in a zsnr system at half filling .",
    "we show that the rkky interaction in zsnr consists of three terms namely the heisenberg , ising and dm terms , without the rashba or dresselhaus interaction and find that , due to the zero - energy edge state of zsnr , the rkky coupling is significantly enhanced when impurities are located on the zigzag edges .",
    "we also find that the rkky interaction in the topological insulator region is much greater than that in the band insulator region when impurities located on edges .",
    "it would be worthwhile mentioning that although there is a finite gap in the bulk silicene in the topological insulator region , the bulk - edge correspondence leads to a zero - gap structure on the edges .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that the ground - state of the system consists of dilute magnetic moments on edges can display a spiral , fm or afm phase depends on the value of the out - of - plane electric field .    the organization of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we first show the tight - binding hamiltonian of silicene nanoribbon in the presence of an out - of - plane electric field then introduce the rkky interaction in terms of non - interacting green s function of the zsnr . in section  [ sec : numeric ] , we present our numeric calculations for the coupling strengths of the rkky interaction in the zsnrs in terms of distance between impurities and the out - of - plabe electric field .",
    "section  [ sec : con ] contains discussions and a brief summary of our main results .",
    "the low - energy excitation of silicene is described by dirac electrons with a large soc interaction . the phase diagram of silicene as functions of the electric field and exchange field exhibit a rich physics  @xcite in which a quantum anomalous hall insulator , valley polarized metal , quantum spin hall and band insulator phases exist .",
    "remarkably , they are characterized by the chern number and spin - chern number together with the edge modes of a nanoribbon .",

    "<S> we study the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interaction between two adatom magnetic impurities placed on zigzag silicene nanoribbon ( zsnr ) in the presence of the out - of - plane electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the interaction mediated by the charge carriers of the pristine zsnr at half filling . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the rotation of the spin of the itinerant electrons due to the exchange interaction causes a twisted rkky interaction between localized spins which consists of the heisenberg , dzyaloshinsky - moriya , and ising interactions and explore the tunability of the rkky interaction terms in respect with the perpendicular electric field . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically find that , due to the zero - energy edge state of zsnr , the rkky coupling is significantly enhanced when impurities are located on the zigzag edges . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the rkky interaction in different electric fields and explore that , in the topological insulator phase , the rkky interaction is much greater than that when the system is in the band insulator region . </S>"
