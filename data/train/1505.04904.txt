    "we deal with this issue by imposing condition [ eq : maximality ] which forces all the spectrum near @xmath54 to be in @xmath54 . in general , assuming that the lyapunov exponent does not vanish throughout the spectrum , the existence of the intervals @xmath54 , to which part ( b ) of our theorem applies , follows from the continuity of the lyapunov exponent ( see @xcite,@xcite ) and the density of gaps given by @xcite .",

    "they consider the continuum quasi - periodic schrdinger operator @xmath66 where @xmath67 @xmath68 , @xmath69 being small and with a diophantine vector @xmath8 , @xmath70 using the estimates from  @xcite they establish the following relation between the gaps and the bands of the operator :    there exists @xmath71 such that for @xmath72 , the gaps in the spectrum of the operator @xmath73 can be labeled as @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 so that the following estimates hold :    1 .   for every @xmath75 , we have @xmath77 2 .   for every @xmath78 with @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 , [ e_{m'}^- , e_{m'}^+ ] ) \\ge a |m'|^{-b},\\ ] ] where @xmath82 are constants depending on @xmath83 .",

    "if so , are these optimal estimates ?    consider the almost mathieu operator @xmath99(n ) = -\\phi(n-1)-\\phi(n+1)+2\\lambda\\cos(2\\pi(x+n\\omega ) ) \\phi(n),\\quad n\\in \\mathbb{z}.\\ ] ]    it is a fundamental fact that the lyapunov exponent here obeys @xmath100 for all @xmath5 .",

    "the set @xmath6 is a @xmath30-homogeneous set for some @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore , the estimates in [ thm : gaps - separation ] hold .",
    "the relevance of the homogeneity property to the inverse spectral theory of almost - periodic potentials ( or jacobi matrices with almost periodic coefficients ) was established in the remarkable work by sodin and yuditskii @xcite .",
    "they studied the inverse spectral problem for reflectionless jacobi matrices whose spectrum is a given homogeneous set .",
    "the reflectionless potentials were introduced , in the continuum setting , by craig @xcite .",
    "reflectionless potentials are very relevant to the spectral theory of ergodic potentials .",
    "different classes of potentials , which are in fact reflectionless , were studied , prior to @xcite , in the basic works on ergodic potentials by deift and simon @xcite , johnson @xcite , johnson and moser @xcite , kotani  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it was shown in the work @xcite that being reflectionless is the key feature which allows for the development of a number of fundamental objects from the periodic theory like auxiliary spectrum , trace formula , product expansions ; see also the work by gesztezy and simon  @xcite . employing the version of the trace formula from  @xcite , gesztezy and yuditskii @xcite found another remarkable consequence of the homogeneity property combined with being reflectionless : the spectrum is purely absolutely continuous .",
    "see also the paper by poltoratski and remling  @xcite , where an even stronger result was established .    in view of these results and the results of the current paper",
    "it seems very natural to investigate the connection between the homogeneity property and the spectral phase transition theory of quasi - periodic potentials , see the work by avila @xcite .",
    "namely , we would like to pose the following question :    consider @xmath104(n ) \\equiv - \\varphi(n-1 ) - \\varphi(n+1 ) +   \\lambda v(x + n\\omega)\\varphi(n ) = e\\varphi(n)\\ ] ] with real analytic @xmath51 and diophantine @xmath8 .",
    "it is known that for small @xmath105 , the operator has a complete set of bloch - floquet eigenfunctions .",
    "we expect that , in analogy to the small - coupling result in the continuum case from @xcite , one can prove also that the spectrum is homogeneous and , moreover , that the calibration estimates ( i)(iii ) for gaps and bands hold .",
    "assume that the lyapunov exponent @xmath106 vanishes on the spectrum for all @xmath107 .",
    "can one find a complete set of bloch - floquet eigenfunctions for @xmath107 ?",
    "the main issue here is how to control the homogeneity property of the spectrum using the zero lyapunov exponent on the spectrum . indeed , while vanishing lyapunov exponents on a set of positive lebesgue measure imply the presence of absolutely continuous spectrum , the homogeneity of the spectrum is a sufficient condition for _ purely _ absolutely continuous spectrum .",
    "once the latter property has been established , the existence of a complete set of bloch - floquet eigenfunctions follows from the work of kotani @xcite , deift - simon @xcite , and avila - krikorian @xcite .",
    "finally , we want to stress the fact that the analysis of  fine properties \" of the spectral set @xmath108}(x,\\omega)$ ] on * a finite interval * , especially with general analytic @xmath51 , seems to be a very interesting problem in its own right .",

    "rellich functions . ]",
    "one can see some  almost gaps \" shadowed by  rare graphs fragments \" , see for instance figure  [ fig:4 ] between the spectral value levels @xmath111 and @xmath112 . even for the almost mathieu case",
    ", the picture still has some  gaps shadowing \" , see figure  [ fig:5 ] .",
    "rellich functions . ]    rellich functions . ]",
    "the picture simplifies under periodic boundary conditions , see figure  [ fig:6 ] .",
    "finally , we would like to pose the following problem :    \\(a ) describe as accurately as possible the  true \" gaps in the spectral set @xmath113,d } ( x , \\omega)$ ] on a finite interval with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , determine the gaps of smallest size .",
    "\\(b ) develop a description for the spectral set @xmath114,p}(x,\\omega)$ ] on a finite interval with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "\\(c ) develop a description of the spectral sets on a finite interval for rational approximations of the frequency @xmath8 .      as mentioned before",
    ", the homogeneity of the spectrum for continuous schrdinger operators and small coupling constant was recently established in @xcite via detailed quantitative results concerning the structure of the gaps in the spectrum .",
    "we show in this paper that in the regime of positive lyapunov exponent , homogeneity can be obtained with less machinery .",
    "in fact one does not even need to use finite scale localization .",
    "rather , we use finite scale approximate eigenvalues rather than eigenfunctions .",
    "this approach only relies on the availability of a large deviation estimate ; compare @xcite , where a similar idea was used .",
    "this method has the advantage of avoiding the removal of a `` non - arithmetic '' set of frequencies , which would be needed to eliminate the double resonances , as required in order to establish localization . to capture the infinite volume spectrum ,",
    "we establish a criterion for given @xmath115 to fall in the spectrum on the whole lattice , see lemma  [ lem : spectrum - criterion ] .",
    "the most basic mechanism behind the homogeneity of the spectrum is the _",
    "wegner estimate_. it is a finite volume version of the fact that the _ integrated density of states is hlder continuous_. for any @xmath116 , let @xmath117 denote the eigenvalues and a choice of normalized eigenvectors of @xmath118}(x , \\omega)$ ] , respectively .",
    "the wegner estimate amounts to the fact that the graphs of @xmath119 can not be `` too flat '' .",
    "see the discussion of the quantitative version of this issue in remark  [ rem : wegner ] .",
    "the other main reason for the homogeneity of the spectrum is the fragmentary stabilization of the graphs of the dirichlet eigenvalues plotted against the phases at different scales , see figure  [ fig : stability ] .",
    "this allows for good control on the structure of the spectrum on the whole lattice @xmath120 via the spectrum on intervals @xmath20 $ ] with large @xmath121 .",
    "thus , the wegner estimate makes it possible to obtain finite scale spectral segments of considerable size that we can then screen , via fragmentary stabilization , to obtain relatively large sets in the infinite volume spectrum .",
    "heuristically , this is how the proof of [ thm : homogeneity ] proceeds .",
    "fragmentary stability of spectral segments _ : the green fragments ( @xmath122 ) are very close to the spectral segment @xmath123 , @xmath124 $ ] . the small red segments on the @xmath125 axis represent the exceptional set . ]    as we already mentioned , the resolution of the fragmentary stability picture is accurate enough to allow for the proof of homogeneity to go through .",
    "however , it seems that for possible future refinements of the result , one needs the more detailed picture given by finite scale localization .",
    "this is why , after we prove the main result , we also develop the finite scale localization approach .",
    "the novelty here is that we focus on the almost mathieu operator for which we can establish the results without removal of any frequencies @xmath85 .",
    "this is due to the method of jitomirskaya @xcite for eliminating resonances .",
    "the advantage of this method resides with the fact that it explicitly identifies the resonant phases as @xmath126 mod @xmath23 , @xmath127 , and there is no need to eliminate any further @xmath8 s .",
    "we now give a rough outline of the main ingredients for both parts of the paper .",
    "most of them were developed in @xcite .",
    "in fact , we shall cite several results from these papers as part of our argument , see propositions  a  i below .",
    "the following three items describe basic properties of the transfer matrix formalism . throughout , it is essential that the lyapunov exponents are positive .    * large deviation estimate for the characteristic determinants of the dirichlet problem on a finite interval .",
    "* hlder continuity of the lyapunov exponent . * uniform upper bounds for the dirichlet characteristic determinants .",
    "the next three items build upon these foundations and describe essential features of the spectral theory , in particular the localization of the eigenfunctions .    * a version of the wegner estimate . *",
    "elimination of double resonances on finite intervals . * exponential localization on finite intervals .    finally , these tools feed into the following facts , which lie deeper and are of crucial importance to understanding the structure of the gaps in the spectrum .",
    "* quantitative separation of the dirichlet eigenvalues on a finite interval . *",
    "formation of the spectrum on the whole lattice from the spectra on finite intervals .",
    "this paper is not self - contained since we refer to reader to @xcite for some of the rather involved proofs of the aforementioned technical ingredients .",
    "these results are used repeatedly in this work . on the other hand ,",
    "some of the results derived from them , such as the wegner estimate , are easy to obtain and we present the proofs of these facts .    certain finer spectral properties , most notably the localization of the eigenfunctions and separation of the eigenvalues in the setting of [ thm : homogeneity ] , require elimination of a hausdorff dimension zero set of @xmath8 .",
    "so we can not follow that route for the almost mathieu operator .",
    "therefore , approximately half of the work in this paper is devoted to establishing the needed ingredients for the mathieu operator with @xmath128 and with arbitrary @xmath129 .    on first reading",
    ", it is recommended to focus entirely on the proofs of [ thm : gaps - separation ] and theorem  [ thm : homogeneity ] .",
