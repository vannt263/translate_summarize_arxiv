    "the goal of identifying and studying the nature of ultra high - redshift galaxies remains one of the most important challenges in observational cosmology , and holds the key to furthering our understanding of the earliest stages of galaxy evolution and unveiling the nature of the sources responsible for cosmic reionization .",
    "observational constraints provided by the gunn - peterson trough in the spectra of high - redshift quasars ( e.g fan et al .",
    "2006 ) suggest that reionization was coming to an end at @xmath13 ( becker et al .",
    "moreover , optical polarization measurements from the wmap experiment indicate that reionization began at @xmath14 if it is assumed to be a single , rapid event ( dunkley et al .",
    "consequently , it is now apparent that to improve our understanding of cosmic reionization , and to unveil the earliest epoch of galaxy formation , it is necessary to extend studies of high - redshift galaxies into the redshift @xmath15 rgime ( e.g. robertson et al .  2010 ) .    given our existing knowledge of the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function in the redshift interval @xmath16 ( e.g. bouwens et al .",
    "2007 ; mclure et al . 2009 ) it is clear that achieving this aim requires ultra - deep near - ir imaging , reaching detection limits of @xmath17 . at the bright end of this range , wide - field",
    ", ground - based imaging has a unique contribution to make , and has recently allowed the luminosity function , the clustering properties and the stellar populations of luminous lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs : mclure et al .",
    "2009 ; ouchi et al . 2009 ; grazian et al .",
    "2010 ) and lyman alpha emitters ( laes : ouchi et al . 2010 ; ota et al . 2010 ; ono et al . 2010 ; nakamura et al .",
    "2010 ) to be studied in detail .",
    "indeed , the importance of ground - based imaging and spectroscopy has recently been highlighted by the spectroscopic confirmation of two lbgs at @xmath18 and @xmath19 by vanzella et al .",
    "however , in advance of 30-m class ground - based telescopes , it is clear that routinely identifying and studying sub - l@xmath20 galaxies at @xmath21 is only possible using space - based imaging .",
    "consequently , the unparalleled near - ir sensitivity provided by the new wfc3 camera , installed on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) in late 2009 , has proven to be a crucial breakthrough in high - redshift galaxy studies . indeed , despite only covering an area of @xmath22 sq .",
    "arcmin , the unprecedented depth ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) of the first tranche of wfc3/ir imaging of the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ; go-11563 ) led to a raft of early science papers investigating the number densities , luminosity functions , stellar masses and stellar populations of @xmath25 galaxies ( e.g. bouwens et al .",

    "2010 ; finkelstein et al . 2010 ; bunker et al .",
    "interestingly , lehnert et al . (",
    "2010 ) have recently claimed the tentative detection of ly@xmath26 emission at @xmath27 in a wfc3/ir candidate in the hudf , originally identified by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010a ) and mclure et al .",
    "although the large rest - frame equivalent width ( ew@xmath28 ) of the ly@xmath26 emission line suggests that , if confirmed , this object must be a decidedly atypical example of a @xmath0 lbg ( stark , ellis & ouchi 2010 ) , the location of the claimed ly@xmath26 emission line is in good agreement with the original photometric redshifts derived by mclure et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and finkelstein et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ; @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "in addition to the wfc3/ir imaging of the hudf , another key dataset has been the wfc3/ir imaging taken as part of the early release science extra - galactic programme ( ers ; go-11359 ) which , although substantially shallower than the hudf wfc3/ir imaging ( @xmath31 , @xmath24 ) , covers an area approximately ten times larger . by combining the hudf and ers datasets to obtain greater dynamic range in uv luminosity ,",
    "bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) and labb et al . (",
    "2010 ) investigated the relationship between the uv spectral slope ( @xmath32 ) and uv luminosity .",
    "both studies find a correlation , with @xmath33 changing from @xmath34 ( a typical value for lower - redshift starburst galaxies ) at @xmath35 , to extremely blue values of @xmath36 at @xmath37 . as discussed by bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , although dust - free , low metallicity models can produce slopes of @xmath38 , they can only do so under the assumption that the ionising photon escape fraction is high ( @xmath39 ) and that , correspondingly , the contribution from nebular continuum emission is low .",
    "based on stacking the acs+wfc3/ir+irac photometry of @xmath40 lbg candidates in the hudf and ers datasets , labb et al ( 2010 ) find the same correlation between @xmath41 and spectral slope @xmath33 as bouwens et al .",
    "( 2010b ) . however , labb et al . (",
    "2010 ) conclude that it is not possible to reproduce both the blue spectral slopes and significant @xmath42 spectral breaks displayed by the faintest @xmath40 lbg candidates , without recourse to episodic starformation histories and/or a significant contribution from nebular line emission . indeed , ono et al .",
    "( 2010 ) also conclude that nebular line emission may be necessary to reproduce the observed @xmath43m@xmath44 colour in a stack of @xmath13 lae photometry .    despite the uncertainties , one observational result that has received significant attention recently is the apparent relationship between star - formation rate and stellar mass . both labb et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and gonzlez et al .",

    "( 2009 ) for lbgs in the redshift range @xmath45 . as a result , labb et al ( 2010 ) and gonzlez et al .",
    "( 2010 ) conclude that the specific star - formation rate ( ssfr ) of @xmath40 lbgs is remarkably constant ( ssfr @xmath46 gyr@xmath12 ) , and consistent with the value of ssfr @xmath47 gyr@xmath12 observed in star - forming galaxies at @xmath48 ( e.g. daddi et al .",
    "2007 ; magdis et al . 2011 ) . as previously discussed by stark et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , a natural explanation of this observation would be to invoke a star - formation rate which exponentially increases with time although , as shown by finlator , oppenheimer & dav ( 2011 ) , star - formation histories of this type may have difficulty in reproducing some of the most extreme balmer breaks reported in the literature at @xmath0 .",
    "the majority of previous studies which have investigated the high - redshift galaxy population using wfc3/ir imaging have relied on traditional colour - cut , or `` drop - out '' , selection techniques .",
    "in contrast , the principal motivation for this paper is to investigate what can be learned about the @xmath4 galaxy population by fully exploiting the excellent multi - wavelength ( acs+wfc3/ir+irac ) data which is now available over an area of @xmath49 sq .",
    "arcmin . rather than applying standard `` drop - out '' criteria , in this work we continue to pursue the strategy we have previously adopted ( mclure et al . 2006 ; 2009 ; 2010 ) and employ a template - fitting , photometric redshift analysis to select our final high - redshift galaxy sample . a key new element in this strategy is our development of a deconfusion algorithm capable of providing the robust irac photometry necessary for improved photometric redshift and stellar - mass estimates .    in principle",
    "this technique should have several advantages over the standard lbg `` drop - out '' selection .",
    "firstly , by employing all of the available multi - wavelength data , including the irac photometry , it is possible to make optimal use of the available information . secondly , by avoiding any colour pre - selection this approach should be less biased towards simply selecting the very bluest galaxies at high - redshift .",
    "this second point is potentially crucial within the context of investigating the claims of ultra - blue uv spectral slopes for lbg candidates at @xmath4 ( see section 4 ) .",
    "finally , an sed fitting analysis also provides an estimate of the photometric redshift probability density function , @xmath50 , and therefore allows the prevalence , and significance , of competing photometric redshift solutions at low redshift to be transparently investigated .",
    "the primary motivation of this paper is therefore to construct the most robust sample possible using the available data and techniques reviewed above , in order to critically address some of the claims about the properties of the @xmath51 population newly - found with hst .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "in section 2 we describe the available data in each of the three fields , including a brief description of our irac deconfusion algorithm . in section 3",
    "we describe our initial candidate selection , photometric redshift analysis and the construction of the final catalogue of robust candidates . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we investigate the uv spectral slopes , stellar masses and star - formation rates of the final robust sample . in section 6",
    "we perform a detailed comparison of our final robust sample with samples previously derived in the literature , exploring the reasons behind any apparent discrepancies . in section 7",
    "we provide a summary of our main conclusions . in the appendix we provide a full description of our irac deconfusion procedure , full photometry and grey - scale postage stamp images for each high - redshift candidate and individual plots illustrating the results of our sed fitting .",
    "all magnitudes are quoted in the ab system ( oke & gunn 1983 ) and all calculations assume @xmath52 and @xmath53 kms@xmath12mpc@xmath12 .",
    "the analysis in this paper relies on the publicly available optical , near - ir and mid - ir imaging data covering the hudf , hudf09 - 2 and ers fields . in this section",
    "we briefly describe the relevant details of the various imaging datasets , and the depth analysis which was performed in order to attribute accurate error estimates to the candidate photometry .",
    "the basic properties of the three fields are listed in table 1 .",
    "the wfc3/ir imaging of both the hudf and the hudf09 - 2 fields was taken as part of the public treasury programme go-11563 ( p.i.=illingworth ) and consists of single pointings ( @xmath22 sq .",

    "the final mosaics have psfs with fwhm in the range @xmath58@xmath59depending on the filter , and were drizzled onto a final grid of 0.06/pix . in the case of the hudf and ers mosaics ,",
    "the final astrometry was matched to that of the publicly available reductions of the optical acs imaging of the udf ( beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) and goods - s ( goodsv2.0 ; giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) respectively .",
    "the astrometry for the final mosaics of the hudf09 - 2 field was matched to the @xmath43band imaging of goods - s taken as part of the musyc survey ( cardamone et al .",
    "2010 ) , with a typical r.m.s .",
    "accuracy of @xmath60 .",
    "the wfc3/ir imaging of the ers analysed in this paper consists of the data comprising the completed programme .",
    "however , for the hudf09 - 2 and hudf fields we make use of the epoch 1 observations , which consist of the data publicly available as of february 2010 and august 2010 respectively .      for the hudf and ers",
    "fields the acs data used in this study consists of the publicly available reductions of the f435w , f606w , f775w and f850lp ( hereafter @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) imaging of the hudf ( beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) and goods - s ( v2.0 ; giavalisco et al .",
    "the acs imaging covering the hudf09 - 2 field is our own reduction ( based on calacs and multidrizzle ) of the @xmath64 and @xmath63 imaging obtained as part of the udf05 programme ( oesch et al .",
    "all of the optical acs imaging was re - sampled to a 0.06/pix grid to match the wfc3/ir data , and the astrometry of the acs data covering hudf09 - 2 was also registered to match the musyc imaging of goods - s .      for the hudf and ers fields we make use of the publicly available reductions ( v0.30 ) of the @xmath7 m and @xmath65 m irac imaging obtained as part of the goods survey ( proposal i d 194 , dickinson et al . ; in preparation ) .",
    "the irac data covering the ers consists of approximately 23 hours of on - source integration in both the @xmath7 m and @xmath65 m bands . for the hudf we performed an inverse variance weighted stack of the overlapping region of the epoch 1 and epoch 2 imaging , producing final mosaics consisting of approximately 46 hours of on - source integration at @xmath7 m and @xmath65 m . for the hudf09 - 2 we re - registered and stacked the mopex reductions of the @xmath7 m imaging obtained via proposal i d 30866 ( p.i .",
    "r. bouwens ) producing a final @xmath7 m mosaic with an on - source integration time of approximately 33 hours .",
    "the consistency of the irac photometry was checked via reference to the simple ( damen et al .",

    "the astrometry of the irac imaging in all three fields was registered to that of the corresponding @xmath55 wfc3/ir imaging .      a key new feature of the analysis undertaken in this paper is the inclusion of the irac photometry in the candidate high - redshift galaxy selection procedure . due to its depth , and",
    "comparatively broad psf ( fwhm @xmath66 ) , the @xmath67 m irac imaging covering the three fields of interest is heavily confused , making the process of obtaining aperture photometry matched to the optical / nearir hst imaging non trivial . in order to achieve this aim",
    "it is therefore necessary to pursue some form of deconfusion process , which allows the irac imaging to be utilised beyond the natural confusion limit .",
    "although there are several techniques which can be used to deconfuse irac imaging ( see appendix a ) we have developed our own software which uses the wfc3/ir imaging data to provide normalized templates for each object in the field and then , via a transfer function , produces synthetic irac images on the native 0.6/pix plate scale . through a matrix inversion procedure , the amplitude ( or total flux ) of each template",
    "can be simultaneously fitted to produce the optimal reproduction of the observed irac image ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . as a result of this procedure",
    "it is effectively possible to extract accurate aperture photometry from the @xmath7 m and @xmath65 m irac imaging at the spatial resolution of the wfc3/ir imaging .",
    "an additional advantage of this approach is that it naturally provides robust uncertainties on the delivered flux measurements , which depend both on the signal - to - noise ratio of the irac detection _ and _ the local level of confusion in the irac image ."
