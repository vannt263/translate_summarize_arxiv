    "the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) is a fundamental signature of strong correlations in two dimensional systems . in the fqhe ,",
    "the electrons lower their interaction by binding with vortices to form composite fermions  @xcite which are then weakly interacting .",
    "the integer quantum hall effect of these composite fermions is the fqhe of the electrons .",
    "@xcite the formation of composite fermions and the fqhe relies on an ineraction between electrons that is sufficiently short range .",
    "the composite fermion wavefunction is a good approximation when this interaction is sufficiently short ranged , a condition which can be quantified by the haldane pseudopotentials .",
    "@xcite    with rapid improvement in the quality of topological insulators ( tis ) has come progress towards the observation of integer and fractional quantum hall effects in these systems .",
    "topological insulators have insulating bulk electronic states but an odd number of topologically protected dirac cones on the surface .",
    "@xcite because of the dirac nature of the electrons , many properties of tis are analagous to those of graphene .",
    "one of these properties is the landau level ( ll ) structure for dirac fermions , which is quite unique ; the energy levels are proportional to the square root of the ll indices due to the chiral nature of the electrons .",
    "@xcite recently this graphene - like integer quantum hall effect has been observed in strained bulk hgte  @xcite and the ll spectrum has been measured in bi@xmath5se@xmath6 using scanning tunneling microscopy  @xcite . in addition , features in the hall resistance at fractional filling factors have been speculated to be related to the fqhe of topological insulators .",
    "@xcite with these experiments , coupled with the observation of the fqhe in graphene  @xcite and the evidence for a strong inter - electron interaction in tis  @xcite , arises the question of the possiblity of observing the fqhe in topological insulators .",
    "this paper reports on the stability of the fqhe in topological insulators from a theoretical perspective .",
    "it is shown that the fqhe is observable for @xmath0 and @xmath7 lls , however is not stable for higher lls . due to the spin orbit interaction of the tis , there is an anisotropy of the @xmath7 lls which is not seen in graphene or in the lowest ( @xmath0 ) landau level .",
    "@xcite these results hold when the bulk is conducting , although a bulk contribution to the conductivity may make these features more difficult to observe .",
    "the landau levels of topological insulators have been calculated  @xcite and bear a striking similarity to those of graphene  @xcite .",
    "there are however two important differences .",
    "first , topological insulators have a high zeeman energy , with a @xmath8-factor as large as 30 ( ref .",
    "second , although the hamiltonians of a ti and graphene are mathematically identical , the hilbert space basis functions are different . in graphene ,",
    "spin up and spin down states are degenerate , and the hamiltonian is written in the pseudospin basis , which is related to the presence of two atoms in the unit cell of the hexagonal lattice . in tis ,",
    "the hamiltonian is written in the basis of the real spin .",
    "these two factors manifest as a tendency for the spin to polarize along the direction of magnetic field in tis .",
    "this work considers the ideal case of a single dirac cone , occuring in materials such as bi@xmath9se@xmath10 and bi@xmath9te@xmath10 ,  @xcite and restrict the calculation to a single surface .",
    "if the two surfaces are not too close together , the final results will hold for each surface independently .",
    "the stability of the fqhe states can be predicted by considering the ratio of the haldane pseudopotentials , which are the matrix elements of the interaction of the electrons within a ll ,  @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the state in the @xmath13th ll with angular momentum @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the interaction .",
    "these pseudopotentials measure the interaction between particles in two states within the same ll .",
    "the two - body states must be antisymmetric which implies that only pseudopotentials of odd relative angular momentum , ( @xmath14 where @xmath16 is odd ) are relevant .",
    "typically one can predict the stability of the fqhe by considering only the @xmath17 and @xmath18 pseudopotentials , since @xmath19 falls off quickly as @xmath16 increases . although there are ways to more precisely quantify the pseudopotentials role in predicting the stability of the composite fermions , these states tend to be stable if the ratio of the @xmath17 pseudopotential to the @xmath18 pseudopotential is larger than @xmath20 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; in this case the fqhe may be observed .",
    "this is because the composite fermion wavefunction is accurate when the interaction is short range ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) , and remains a good approximation when @xmath23 is large enough .",
    "the non - interacting electron hamiltonian in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field is  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the fermi velocity and @xmath26 is the two - dimensional canonical momentum . the @xmath27-direction is taken to be perpendicular to the surface and the symmetric gauge , @xmath28 , has been used .",
    "here , the superscript @xmath29 stands for transpose . in analogy with graphene  @xcite",
    "this hamiltonian can be written in terms of ladder operators , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the magnetic length and @xmath32 are the ladder operators . here , @xmath33 , as usual .",
    "there are two more linearly independent ladder operators ,  @xcite @xmath34 which are related to the @xmath27-component of the angular momentum , @xmath35 . in analogy with graphene ,",
    "the solutions are linear combinations of the usual two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) eigenstates ,  @xcite @xmath36 , which satisfy @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "these states have energies  @xcite @xmath43 in the limit of @xmath44 , the above equations reduce to those of graphene .",
    "the coulomb interaction is @xmath45 which acts on the two - body states , @xmath46 where the single ket denotes the product state of the usual quantum well states , @xmath47 .",
    "then the pseudopotentials of the coulomb interaction are @xmath48 where  @xcite @xmath49^{2}l_{m}(k^{2})e^{-k^{2}}\\label{vmn}\\\\ v_{m}^{(n , n-1 ) } & \\equiv &   \\langle { { \\left\\lvert n\\right\\rvert}\\ , m_1 } ; { { \\left\\lvert n\\right\\rvert}-1\\ , m_2}\\rvert v\\lvert { { \\left\\lvert n\\right\\rvert}\\ , m_3 } ; { { \\left\\lvert n\\right\\rvert}-1\\ , m_4}\\rangle\\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\int \\frac{d^{2}k}{(2\\pi)^{2}}v(k)l_{{\\left\\lvert n\\right\\rvert}}\\left(\\frac{k^{2}}{2}\\right)l_{{\\left\\lvert n\\right\\rvert}-1}\\left(\\frac{k^{2}}{2}\\right)l_{m}(k^{2})e^{-k^{2}}\\label{vmmix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath50 is the fourier transform of the coulomb potential and @xmath14 is the relative angular momentum .     while the dashed lines are for negative @xmath13 .",
    "the inset is the same as the main figure , but with a different vertical scale to highlight the @xmath51 lls . ]",
    "figure  [ ppratiovsb ] shows the ratio of the @xmath17 to the @xmath18 pseudopotentials for the coulomb interaction as a function of zeeman energy . in the lowest ( @xmath0 )",
    "ll , the spin is perfectly polarized without the addition of a magnetic field , so the ratio is independent of the zeeman energy .",
    "for all other values of @xmath52 , the symmetry between @xmath13 and @xmath53 is broken as the zeeman energy increases from zero .",
    "the pseudopotential ratio increases as a function of zeeman energy for @xmath54 , indicating an increased stability of the fractional quantum hall state , while just the opposite happens for @xmath55 . however , when @xmath56 , the pseudopotential ratio becomes smaller than 1.2 , and the fractional hall effect is likely to be unstable .",
    "thus the features seen in refs .",
    "@xcite at filling factors @xmath57 are unlikely to be precursors to the fqhe .     while the dashed lines are for negative @xmath13 .",
    "the inset is the same as the main figure , but with a different vertical scale to highlight the @xmath51 lls . ]",
    "the presence of a noninsulating bulk may significantly alter the form of the interaction . as a model ,",
    "consider the form @xmath58 which behaves as the coulomb interaction ( @xmath59 ) at short distances and as a dipole - dipole interaction ( @xmath60 ) at large distances .",
    "the parameter @xmath61 characterizes the size of the dipole . for simplicity ,",
    "i have taken @xmath62 ; when the two electrons are much further than a thomas - fermi screening length , then they interact as if they are two dipoles , with the noninsulating bulk creating the positive end of each dipole .",
    "the pseudopotential will have exactly the same form as equations  - with @xmath50 replaced by the fourier transform of the model interaction ,  .",
    "figure  [ ppratio - dipole ] shows the ratio of the @xmath17 to the @xmath18 pseudopotential for the model interaction .",
    "figures  [ ppratiovsb ] and  [ ppratio - dipole ] are qualitatively similar , and differ only in quantitative aspects .",
    "the ratio , @xmath63 , has increased for the @xmath64 and @xmath65 lls , which suggests an increased stability of the fqhe .",
    "however , the ratio has decreased for @xmath56 ; i.e. the noninsulating bulk will make the fqhe even less stable .",
    "in conclusion , this paper has ruled out fqhe in lls @xmath66 , while predicting its stability for @xmath67 for a ti surface . due to the strong spin orbit interaction in tis ,",
    "there is an asymmetry in the fqhe for @xmath3 and @xmath4 lls , in contrast to graphene .",
    "the effect of screening by a noninsulating bulk has been included by using a model interaction which looks like a dipole - dipole interaction at distances larger than the thomas fermi screening length .",
    "although the composite fermion states in the lls @xmath67 are further stabilized by this model interaction , the composite fermion state in higher lls ( @xmath68 ) are further destabilized due to the weaker long range interaction .",
    "i would like to thank jainendra jain for many useful discussions and for comments on this manuscript .",
