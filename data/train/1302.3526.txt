    "the detailed properties of our implementation of the lvg approximation are described in @xcite .",
    "one important point regarding this implementation of the lvg model is our scaling of the calculated ortho - h@xmath0co / he excitation rates to those appropriate for collisions with h@xmath0 . following the recommendation of @xcite , we scale the calculated he rates by a factor of 2.2 to account for ( 1 ) the reduced collision velocity of he relative to h@xmath0 , which scales as the inverse - square - root of the masses of he and h@xmath0 and ( 2 ) the larger cross section of the h@xmath0 molecule ( @xmath230 ; @xcite ) relative to he .    radiative transfer models of the molecular emission in astrophysical environments are dependent upon collisional excitation rates for the molecule(s ) under study . as noted by @xcite and @xcite , the uncertainty associated with the collisional excitation rates",
    "must be considered in any analysis of the physical conditions derived from radiative transfer modelling .",
    "@xcite suggests that the total collisional excitation rate for a given h@xmath0co transition is accurate to @xmath231 .",
    "this implies that the physical conditions derived from our lvg modelling are limited to an accuracy of no better than 20% .",
    "for the 13 galaxies and one galaxy offset position ( m82sw ) where both the h@xmath0co @xmath1 and @xmath3 transitions were detected we can derive a unique solution to the ( ensemble average ) spatial density and h@xmath0co column density _ for an assumed gas kinetic temperature_. this unique solution to the physical conditions is derived by fitting to the intercept between the h@xmath0co @xmath1 and @xmath3 transition ratio and the h@xmath0co @xmath1 transition intensity at the assumed kinetic temperature .",
    "absorption line measurements afford the possibility of using the measured apparent optical depths in the lvg model fitting procedure . for our galaxy sample , where with the exception of m82 @xmath232 , this method has the disadvantage of involving an estimate of the excitation temperature ( t@xmath233 ) in order to derive the apparent optical depth . since t@xmath233 is dependent upon the input physical conditions that we are attempting to derive , we do not believe that fitting to measured apparent h@xmath0co optical depths is advantageous .",
    "in fact , as we showed in   5.3.3 of @xcite , these two approaches to estimating the excitation of h@xmath0co absorption lines in the presence of the cosmic background radiation and weak ambient continuum emission are roughly equivalent for the measurements presented in this paper .",
    "furthermore , we showed in @xcite that for m82 , which possesses strong continuum emission , ignoring contributions due to background continuum emission produces a derived spatial density which is a lower - limit to the true average spatial density in this galaxy .",
    "as was done in @xcite , a model grid of predicted h@xmath0co transition intensities over a range and step size in spatial density , ortho - h@xmath0co column density per velocity gradient , and kinetic temperature ( n(h@xmath0 ) , n(ortho - h@xmath0co)/@xmath234 , t@xmath235 ) = ( @xmath236@xmath8 , @xmath237@xmath238/kms@xmath33 , 20300k ) and ( @xmath239(n(h@xmath0 ) ) , @xmath239(n(ortho - h@xmath0co)/@xmath234 ) , @xmath17t@xmath235 ) = ( 0.03(@xmath8 ) , 0.04(@xmath238/kms@xmath33 ) , 5k ) was calculated .",
    "note that the model grid used in the present calculations is significantly larger in all three modeled parameters than that used in @xcite .",
    "the predicted transition intensities were then compared to our measured h@xmath0co @xmath1 and @xmath3 transition intensities ( table  [ tab : h2comeasurements ] ) .",
    "table  [ tab : lvg ] lists the derived lvg model best - fit physical conditions for all of the h@xmath0co - detected galaxies in our sample .",
    "there are three different sets of assumptions used to derive these physical conditions dependent upon the information available :    * _ both transitions detected : _ for the 13 galaxies and one galaxy offset position where we have detected both the h@xmath0co @xmath1 and @xmath3 transitions , we calculate explicit values for the spatial density and ortho - h@xmath0co column density assuming t@xmath174 = t@xmath240 , with t@xmath240 from table  [ tab : galaxies ] . for the 12 galaxies where we also have nh@xmath5-based kinetic temperature measurements @xcite , we also derive spatial density and column density assuming these gas - derived kinetic temperatures . as ngc253 and ic342 possess two nh@xmath5-derived temperature components lvg model fits assuming both of these kinetic temperatures are listed . for the lvg model fits with nh@xmath5-derived kinetic temperatures , kinetic temperature uncertainties @xcite are included . by using nh@xmath5-derived kinetic temperatures to constrain our h@xmath0co - derived spatial densities we are assuming cospatiality for these two dense molecular gas tracers .",
    "as the spectral line profiles from nh@xmath5 and h@xmath0co are similar in all but one galaxy ( ngc660 ; see  [ ngc660 ] ) , the assumption of cospatiality seems plausible .",
    "* _ one transition detected and limit to other transition : _ for the 8 galaxies and one galaxy velocity component where we have detected only one of the two k - doublet transitions , but also have a limit to the nondetected transition , we make two estimates of the physical conditions : * * we derive limits to both the spatial density and ortho - h@xmath0co column density assuming a kinetic temperature of 40  k , a @xmath241 intensity limit , and an equivalent line width for the nondetected transition .",
    "furthermore , since our lvg modeling results imply that the @xmath1 transition goes into emission before the @xmath3 transition as the spatial density is increased ( for a fixed kinetic temperature ) , a detection of absorption in the @xmath1 transition means that the ( undetected ) @xmath3 transition _ must _ also be in absorption . on the other hand",
    ", a detection of the @xmath1 transition in emission implies that the @xmath3 transition can either be in emission or absorption .",

    "t@xmath235 = t@xmath240 .",
    "this line of reasoning allows us to derive an actual value rather than a limit for n(ortho - h@xmath0co)/@xmath17v that we can use in a calculation of the dense gas mass .",
    "the column densities derived using these assumptions are listed in column 3 of table  [ tab : lvg ] . * _ neither transition detected : _ for the 35 galaxies where we derive only limits to the @xmath1 and/or the @xmath3 transition intensities we assume a @xmath241 limit to the measured yet undetected intensities .",
    "this allows us to calculate a limit to the ortho - h@xmath0co column density assuming n(h@xmath0 ) = @xmath242 @xmath8 and t@xmath235 = t@xmath240 .",
    "note that we conservatively do not assume a line width in these limits , which would decrease the intensity limit by the square - root of the number of channels over which the line is integrated .",
