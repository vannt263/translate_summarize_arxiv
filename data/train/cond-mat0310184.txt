    "the phenomenon of shot noise , associated with the randomness and discreteness in charge transmission has become a fundamental issue in the study of mesoscopic systems in the nanoscale region .",
    "@xcite since shot noise contains temporal information on the transmitted carriers , it can be used to deduce , for example , an effective quasiparticle charge , kinetic parameters , or other parameters on the interaction among carriers  information that usually can not be obtained from time - averaged measurements of the mean current or conductance . in particular ,",
    "shot noise is currently used as a tool to probe fractional charge , @xcite effective superconducting charge , @xcite quantum transmission modes in atomic - size contacts , @xcite mechanisms of tunneling , @xcite etc .",
    "( see also recent review in ref . ) .",
    "a matter of particular interest is the significance of coulomb interactions in scattering - free or ballistic conductors .",
    "as was recently shown , coulomb interactions may suppress the shot noise down to several orders of magnitude in space - charge - limited ballistic conductors .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we focus mainly on the question of how the effect of coulomb interactions on the shot noise can be employed to reveal important information on the energy profile of nonequilibrium carriers injected from an emitter contact .    using ballistic electrons to study nanoscale structures",
    "has recently been a very active research area . in the standard technique",
    "called `` hot - electron spectroscopy , '' @xcite carriers injected from an emitter contact are analyzed in a collector contact by means of a barrier that is transparent only for carriers having energy greater than the barrier height . by changing the bias on the collector barrier",
    ", the electron energy profile can be analyzed .",
    "this technique requires the design of a special collector filter for obtaining information on the electron energies . here , we discuss an alternative method that does not require a design of the filter , rather it employs a `` natural '' filter : the potential barrier that appears due to an injected space charge .",
    "this space charge limits the current producing the resistance effect by means of a barrier , which reflects a part of the injected carriers back to the emitter .",
    "the height of the barrier depends on the screening parameter of the material , and it varies with the external bias .",
    "the essential difference with the case of a fixed barrier is that the space - charge barrier fluctuates in time and produces long - range coulomb correlations between the transmitted electrons that leads to the significant suppression of shot noise registered at the collector contact .",
    "the level of suppression depends drastically on the energy profile of the injected carriers , @xcite while the time - averaged quantities ( the mean current , conductance , etc . )",
    "therefore , one can use the shot - noise measurements to reveal the details in the energy profile .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the basic equations describing the space - charge - limited ballistic transport and noise in a two - terminal conductor . as a particular example , we address the situation when in addition to the fermi - dirac injection from each lead , there is an extra injection of monoenergetic electrons represented by a @xmath0 peak in energy spectrum at the emitter lead .",
    "the self - consistent steady - state solutions for this case are found in sec .",

    "we consider a two - terminal multimode ballistic conductor in a planar lead geometry ( fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) . in a semiclassical framework ,",
    "the electron occupation numbers @xmath1 are determined by the electron flows from the left and right leads .",
    "@xcite the inhomogeneity of the space charge disturbs the electrostatic potential in such a way that the self - consistent built - in field determines the potential barrier , at which electrons are either reflected or transmitted depending on their energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig ] ) . assuming that the barrier is much wider than the wavelength of electrons , one can neglect tunneling and quantum reflection , i.e. , the transmission probability is 1 if the electron energy is higher than the barrier height , and it is 0 in the opposite case . in this framework ,",
    "the transport is described by the collisionless boltzmann equation self - consistently coupled with the poisson equation supplemented by the stochastic boundary conditions for the occupation numbers : @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electron effective mass , @xmath4 is the electronic charge , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the dimension of a momentum space ( the spin components are neglected ) , @xmath7 is the dielectric permittivity of the media , @xmath8 is the self - consistent electric potential , and @xmath9 is the applied bias ( below we assume that @xmath9 is fixed by an external circuit ) . in the absence of scattering , the noise originates from the stochastic sources @xmath10 at the left ( @xmath11 ) and right ( @xmath12 ) leads , which gives rise to the fluctuations of the occupation numbers and electric potential along the conductor and , as a consequence , the fluctuations of the current .    assuming that the number of the occupied transversal modes is large , one can integrate the occupation numbers @xmath1 over the transverse momentum @xmath13 and obtain for each longitudinal energy @xmath14 the ( fluctuating ) occupation factor at a cross section @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath14=@xmath17 , @xmath18= @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the density of transverse modes .",
    "it is seen that under the ballistic transport conditions , the occupation factors in the bulk are determined by the occupation factors @xmath21 in the leads .",

    ", we consider the situation when in addition to the equilibrium fermi - dirac ( fd ) injection from each lead ( which we call the background injection ) , there is an extra injection from the left ( emitter ) lead with a monoenergetic distribution described by a dirac @xmath0 function ( fig .",

    "then we compute the noise .",
    "the results are presented in figs .",
    "[ peak9 ]  [ peak11 ] .",
    "= 8.0 cm    first , our aim is to understand the effect of the additional peak electrons on the current - noise spectral density .",
    "figure [ peak9 ] shows the results for the case of a @xmath0 peak fixed at the energy @xmath29=@xmath93 and having different amplitudes @xmath30 .",
    "it is seen that at low biases , when the barrier is high ( @xmath94 ) , the peak electrons do not influence the noise since they are all reflected back to the emitter ( @xmath95 . in this regime , @xmath96 . with increasing bias @xmath9 , the potential barrier decreases .",
    "then there will be a point where the energy of the peak meets the potential barrier top . above this point the peak electrons are no longer reflected back , all of them now pass over the barrier and contribute to the current and noise at the collector .",
    "but their effect on the mean current and noise is drastically different .",
    "if the extra current provided by the peak electrons is small with respect to the background current ( as in our example ) , the current - voltage characteristics do not change essentially .",
    "in contrast , the noise power changes significantly : at the bias when @xmath97 , a sharp spike in @xmath71 is observed ( fig .",
    "[ peak9 ] ) .",
    "this spike is not due to the noise of the peak electrons , as one would think .",
    "it originates from the fluctuations of the barrier top , which are induced by the peak electrons .",
    "this influence is very pronounced precisely when the condition @xmath97 holds .",
    "although the fraction of the peak electrons in the total current is small , they dominate ( within a narrow interval of biases at @xmath97 ) in the contribution to the electron density @xmath98 at the barrier position , thereby changing the strength of the barrier top fluctuations .",
    "the latter follows from the fact that the largest contribution to the electron density @xmath99 at the barrier top comes from electrons that virtually stop there ( have zero velocity ) and spend more time around @xmath15=@xmath100 .",
    "these are the electrons from a narrow energy interval around @xmath101 . at higher biases , @xmath102 ,",
    "the @xmath0 peak is shifted above the barrier towards higher energies , and the main contribution to @xmath99 comes again from the background electrons .",
    "thus the noise power becomes @xmath96 as seen from fig .",
    "[ peak9 ] .",
    "so , what we really observe in fig .",
    "[ peak9 ] is the spike of the potential barrier noise , which is sharply increased when the @xmath0 peak coincides with the top of the potential barrier . in this sense",
    "the space - charge potential barrier helps to visualize the details in the injection currents by means of the noise .",
    "note that if the potential barrier is frozen at its time - averaged value , i.e. , when the long - range coulomb correlations are ignored , we obtain from the calculations that the noise spectral density is almost the same in both cases : with and without the @xmath0 peak injection .",
    "this indicates the importance of the long - range coulomb correlations in `` shot - noise spectroscopy . ''",
    "= 8.0 cm    another important feature one can observe in fig .  [ peak9 ] is how the noise spike is modified with increasing density of the @xmath0 peak electrons .",
    "it is seen that the left side of the spike does not change significantly with @xmath30 , while the right side is shifted towards higher biases when @xmath30 increases .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that for higher intensities of the peak , one should apply higher biases to `` open up '' more background electrons in order to exceed the contribution from the peak electrons to the barrier top fluctuations .",
    "an interesting question is why the delta peak injection increases noise and not suppresses it . at the bias when the noise spike appears",
    ", the delta peak electrons almost stop at the barrier top and , therefore , effectively contribute to the negative charge at the barrier top location .",
    "this additional negative charge increases the reflection of the incoming electrons , that means the increase of the barrier heght .",
    "the current fluctuation produced by the barrier increase is of the opposite sign in respect to the injection fluctuation .",
    "moreover , in a small energy range , the compensation fluctuation is much larger in absolute value with respect to the injection one ( overcompensation effect ) .",
    "this is seen in the fact that the function @xmath103 as the energy approaches the barrier top @xmath104 .",
    "@xcite since the noise is calculated as a square of fluctuation , the result is the increase of noise , although it is due to the suppression effect of current fluctuations .",
    "figure [ peak ] illustrates the shot - noise spectroscopy effect .",
    "it is seen that when the energy of the peak electrons changes , the noise spike shifts along the background noise curve , since the bias at which the condition @xmath105 is met changes .",
    "this allows one , in principle , to identify the peak energy if one knows the correspondence between the bias and the barrier height for the background noise .",
    "finally , we have also verified the validity of our numerical algorithm by comparing @xmath71 calculated from the full set of eqs .  ( [ si ] ) and ( [ si_d ] ) with the analytical results obtained in the asymptotic high - bias limit : @xcite @xmath106,\\ ] ] where @xmath107",
    ", @xmath108 is the ratio between the current of the peak and the current of the background , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the constants dependent on the degeneracy of the injected electrons ( @xmath111=@xmath112=1 for nondegenerate electrons ) , @xmath113 are the fermi - dirac integrals of index @xmath114 , and @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the dimensionless positions of the fermi energy and the @xmath0 peak with respect to the potential barrier , respectively .",
    "the results of the comparison are in good agreement , as figs .",
    "[ peak11](a ) and [ peak11](b ) shows . for moderate peak amplitudes ,",
    "the exact solutions follow closely the asymptotic curves to the right of the noise spike . moreover , for this case the results for @xmath117 are almost the same in both cases : with and without the @xmath0 peak [ fig .",
    "[ peak11](a ) ] . for high peak amplitudes [ fig .",
    "[ peak11](b ) ] , the asymptotic curves differ by a small value corresponding to the noise contribution from the peak electrons , non - negligible in this case .",
    "it is remarkable , that the asymptotic theory describes quite well not only the region @xmath118 , where the @xmath0 peak is much higher than the barrier , but also the right side of the spike at @xmath119 , where the peak is close to the barrier position ( slightly above it ) .",
    "the left side of the peak is , however , beyond the asymptotic theory , since in this bias range the @xmath0 peak electrons are reflected from the barrier , and no asymptotic theory exists for this case .",
    "another important feature is that for the case of a high amplitude peak , there exists a small range of biases for which @xmath120 [ fig .",
    "[ peak11](b ) ] .",
    "this means that the current noise may be reduced by an additional injection ( additional noise ) .",
    "we relate this noise suppression phenomenon to the existence of a specific `` noiseless '' energy @xmath121 lying above the barrier @xcite for which @xmath122 . at the bias when @xmath123 crosses @xmath121 , the noise of the @xmath0 peak vanishes , @xmath124 , while the background noise is reduced by the peak electrons by virtue of the barrier fluctuations .",
    "= 8.0 cm = 8.0 cm",
    "we have investigated the shot noise in a space - charge limited ballistic conductor under the condition of an additional ( to the thermal equilibrium ) @xmath0 peak injection from one of the contacts .",
    "coulomb interactions are shown to act as an energy analyzer of the profile of injected electrons , and help to visualize the energy peak in the injection current by means of the shot noise .",
    "the injection peak is not seen in the time - averaged measurements or shot - noise measurements under the conditions when interactions are ineffective .    by measuring the current - noise spectral density as a function of bias",
    ", one can observe a sharp spike in the noise at a certain bias , at which the energy peak coincides with the potential barrier top .",
    "this spike is a signature of electron - electron interactions .",
    "it gives a direct link between the peak and the barrier positions , and can reveal one position when the other is known . for instance , if one knows the injection energy @xmath125 of the @xmath0 peak electrons , one can obtain the bias at which the barrier height @xmath126 , thereby revealing the space - charge - limited conduction and the amount of the space charge .",
    "vice versa , if one knows the space - charge parameters and the barrier position as a function of bias , one can analyze the energy - resolved injection current .",
    "thus , coulomb interactions in ballistic structures are of interest from several points of view : on one hand , they lead to the shot - noise suppression that may be important for applications . on the other hand",
    ", they offer the possibility of using the shot - noise measurements as a tool to deduce important information about the properties of nonequilibrium carriers in nanoscale structures with hot - electron emitters , resonant - tunneling - diode emitters , superlattice emitters , etc .",
    ", not otherwise available from time - averaged measurements .",
    "the validity of our theory can be tested experimentally in currently accessible semiconductor ballistic structures , in which the current is limited by the space charge .",
