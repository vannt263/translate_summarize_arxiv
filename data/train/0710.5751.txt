    "the problem of @xmath2-adically estimating the number of points on an algebraic variety over a finite field of characteristic @xmath2 is quite old .",
    "an answer to a special case of this problem is given by the classical theorem of c. chevalley and e. warning , which asserts that if @xmath3 is a polynomial of degree less than @xmath4 with integral coefficients , then the number of roots of @xmath5 is divisible by @xmath2 .",
    "n. katz conjectured a sharper @xmath2-adic estimate for the number of solutions to the above equation , which then b. mazur proved in @xcite ( and later p. berthelot and a. ogus completed in @xcite ) , making use of the then recently discovered crystalline cohomology .",
    "mazur s result is now frequently referred to as mazur s inequality and it is most easily stated using the so - called newton and hodge vectors .",
    "we will recall this inequality in the setting of @xmath6-isocrystals .",
    "an @xmath6-isocrystal is a pair @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a finite - dimensional vector space over the fraction field @xmath9 of the ring of witt vectors @xmath10 , equipped with a frobenius - linear bijective endomorphism @xmath6 of @xmath8 .",
    "suppose now that our isocrystal @xmath7 is @xmath4-dimensional .",
    "if @xmath11 is a @xmath10-lattice in @xmath8 , then we can associate to it the hodge vector @xmath12 , which measures the relative position of the lattices @xmath11 and @xmath13 . by dieudonn - manin theory , we can associate to @xmath8 its newton vector @xmath14 , which classifies @xmath6-isocrystals of dimension @xmath4 up to isomorphism .",
    "if @xmath15 stands for the `` usual dominance order '' , then mazur s inequality asserts that @xmath16 . in other words , if @xmath17 and @xmath18 , then @xmath19 , @xmath20 , ... , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "r. kottwitz and m. rapoport in @xcite proved a converse to this inequality .",
    "namely , they proved that if we let @xmath7 be an isocrystal of dimension @xmath4 , and let @xmath23 , with @xmath24 , be such that @xmath25 , then there exists a @xmath10-lattice @xmath11 in @xmath8 satisfying @xmath26 .",
    "both mazur s inequality and its converse can be regarded as statements for the group @xmath27the dominance order arises naturally in the context of the root system for @xmath27 .",
    "kottwitz and rapoport in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) formulated a group - theoretic version of the above converse to mazur s inequality , which they proved for @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "they also reduced this problem to a combinatorial - type problem formulated purely in terms of root systems ( see e.g. @xcite for an explicit statement ) .",
    "then c. lucarreli in @xcite , proved that combinatorial statement for all ( split connected ) classical groups .    in @xcite , a new interpretation for the root - system combinatorial problem mentioned above",
    "was introduced ; it was shown that it is equivalent to the vanishing of higher cohomology groups for certain line bundles on toric varieties associated with root systems . in loc.cit .",
    "a generalized version of this was proved for @xmath27 and the usual version for @xmath29 , in particular giving an easy proof for the converse to mazur s inequality for @xmath27 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "one of the surprising outcomes of these results , apart from the link of the converse to mazur s inequality to toric varieties , is that they improve the classical vanishing theorems for these toric varieties ( compare , for example , results in @xcite ) .",
    "they also give new ideas for new vanishing theorems for general toric varieties .    in the current paper , we take a new approach to proving the combinatorial problem mentioned above ( see theorem [ maintheorem ] below ) . also , unlike in other works related to this problem that have appeared so far ,",
    "all the root systems are considered at once and the method of the proof applies to each of them .",
    "we prove a vanishing result ( see theorem [ torictheorem ] below ) for toric varieties associated with _ any _ root system .",
    "also , we believe that these results provide a crucial step and a clear strategy for proving the converse of mazur s inequality for all ( split , connected ) groups .    finally , we mention that these toric varieties have appeared in the de concini - procesi theory of group compactifications ( see e.g. @xcite , pp.187206 ) and are still actively used and studied in that field . they have also appeared on the work related to the local trace formula ( see e.g. @xcite ,  23 ) and the fundamental lemma ( see e.g. @xcite ,  5 ) .",

    "we write @xmath52 for the set of cocharacters @xmath53 .",

    "let @xmath58 be @xmath47-dominant and let @xmath59 be the weyl group of @xmath49 in @xmath47 .",
    "the group @xmath59 acts on @xmath52 and so we consider @xmath60 and the convex hull of @xmath61 in @xmath62 , which we denote by @xmath63 .",
    "define @xmath64    let @xmath65 and write @xmath66 for the natural projection induced by @xmath67 .",
    "note that @xmath68 is a quotient of @xmath52 , but we can consider @xmath69 as a subspace of @xmath70 ( after tensoring with @xmath71 any possible torsion is lost ) .",
    "we now recall an important conjecture of kottwitz and rapoport .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite , sections 4.3 and 4.4 , where it is explained how a converse to mazur s inequality follows from this conjecture .",
    "( kottwitz - rapoport ) let @xmath47 be a split , connected , reductive group over @xmath6 .",
    "keeping the same notation as above , we have    @xmath72 @xmath73 [ conjecture ]    it is worth mentioning that c. lucarelli ( see e.g. @xcite , theorem 0.2 ) has proved that this conjecture holds for every split , connected reductive group over @xmath6 where every irreducible component of its dynkin diagram is of type @xmath74 , or @xmath75 . in @xcite ,",
    "this has been further extended to include the group @xmath29 and a strengthened result has been proved in the case of the group @xmath27 ( see theorems a and b in loc .",
    "we again refer the reader to the introduction in @xcite where references are given for earlier work on this conjecture by other mathematicians .    in this set - up",
    ", our main result can be reformulated as follows .",
    "the above conjecture of kottwitz and rapoport is true for all split , connected , simply - connected semisimple groups in the case when the parabolic subgroup @xmath51 is of semisimple rank 1 .",
    "[ grouptheorem ]    we would like to make a comment about some advantages and disadvantages of the proof of theorem [ maintheorem ] ( and therefore theorem [ grouptheorem ] ) .",
    "one of the advantages of the proof presented in this paper is that , unlike the previous proofs of ( parts of ) the kottwitz - rapoport conjecture , all the root systems are considered at once and the method of the proof applies to each of them .",
    "therefore , in particular , one gets a clearer picture , at least on the root - system level , of the entire problem of a converse to mazur s inequality .",
    "our approach has some serious disadvantages , however .",
    "the assumption that the group @xmath47 is simply - connected is used in an essential way ( equivalently , we only consider the root lattice and not the weight lattice for our corresponding root system ) .",
    "also , we only deal with the case when the parabolic subgroup @xmath51 has semisimple rank 1 .",
    "admittedly , the latter is less of a `` serious '' problem and , in fact , the author believes that it can be overcome without introducing new strategies in the proof .    let us now very briefly recall how this is all connected to vanishing results on certain toric varieties .",
    "the reader is encouraged to consult @xcite ( especially the introduction and section 1 therein ) for more details .    from now on",
    "we assume that @xmath47 is simply - connected .",
    "then @xmath76 is adjoint .",
    "let @xmath76 and @xmath77 be the ( langlands ) complex dual group for @xmath47 and @xmath49 , respectively",
    ". then the corresponding toric variety , which we denote by @xmath78 , is given by requiring that its fan be given by the weyl fan in @xmath79 and its torus be @xmath77 .",
    "( we would like to remark that the toric variety @xmath78 appears naturally in the theory of group compactifications ",
    "see e.g.  @xcite , pp.187206 . )",
    "note that it is now safe for the reader to assume that we are working over complex numbers .    using the canonical surjection",
    ", we define a map @xmath80 where @xmath81 stands for the root lattice for @xmath82 ( note that the codomain of the last map is just @xmath83 ) .    for @xmath11 as above ( a levi subgroup containing @xmath49 ) , we will need a toric variety @xmath84 for the torus @xmath85 ( see e.g.  @xcite ,  23.2 ) .",
    "note that @xmath85 is a subtorus of @xmath77 and so @xmath86 is a subgroup of @xmath87 . the collection of cones from the weyl fan inside @xmath88 that lie in the subspace @xmath89 gives a fan .",
    "this is the fan for the nonsingular , projective toric variety @xmath84 .",
    "let us now assume that our parabolic subgroup @xmath51 is of semisimple rank 1 .",
    "this implies that the root lattice @xmath81 is just @xmath90 for a unique , up to a sign , root @xmath38 of @xmath76 , and that the toric variety @xmath84 , which we now denote by @xmath91 , is a non - torus - invariant divisor in @xmath78 .",
    "the map @xmath92 will now be denoted by @xmath93 . by tensoring with @xmath71",
    "we get a map from @xmath93 , which we still denote by @xmath94 since tensoring with @xmath71 will lose any possible torsion , we can identify the codomain of the last map with the coroot hyperplane @xmath95 : = \\{x \\in   x^*(\\hat{t})\\otimes_{\\mathbb{z}}\\mathbb{r } : \\langle \\alpha^{\\vee},x \\rangle = 0   \\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the canonical pairing between cocharacters and characters , and @xmath39 stands for the coroot of @xmath76 corresponding to @xmath38 .",
    "also , the fan of @xmath91 is contained in the root hyperplane @xmath97 : = \\ { x \\in x_*(\\hat{t } ) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{z}}\\mathbb{r } : \\langle x , \\alpha",
    "\\rangle = 0 \\}.\\ ] ]    now let @xmath98 be a @xmath77-equivariant line bundle on @xmath78 that is generated by its sections .",
    "also , assume that @xmath98 is invariant under the obvious action of @xmath59 .",
    "then we have a short - exact sequence of sheaves on @xmath78 : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the ideal sheaf of @xmath91 and @xmath101 is the inclusion map @xmath102 . note that @xmath103=0 , for all @xmath104 , since @xmath98 is generated by its sections and @xmath78 is projective , and also @xmath105 for all @xmath104 , since @xmath106 is generated by its sections and @xmath91 is a projective toric variety",
    ". therefore the short - exact sequence gives rise to the long - exact sequence @xmath107 using the usual combinatorial interpretation of the 0-th cohomology ( see e.g. @xcite , pg .",
    "66 ) we see that the map @xmath108 is induced by the map @xmath93 . also , clearly , the surjectivity of @xmath108 is equivalent to @xmath109 then one finds ( as is explained in section 1 of @xcite ) that @xmath108 is surjective if and only if theorem [ grouptheorem ] is true .",
    "thus , in this language , our result can be written as follows .",
    "with notation as above , we have that @xmath110 [ torictheorem ]    before we end this section it is worth mentioning that vanishing results like the one in theorem [ torictheorem ] are also of independent interest just from a toric - variety point of view",
    ". a very important vanishing result for toric varieties has been proved by musta ( see e.g.  @xcite , theorem [ maintheorem ] ) , and for the toric varieties associated with root systems , theorem [ torictheorem ] gives the vanishing of higher cohomology groups for more line bundles on these varieties .",
    "as we mentioned earlier , the next section is devoted to proving theorem [ maintheorem ] .",
    "we recall some of the notation from the previous section .",
    "we follow the terminology and notation from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be an irreducible , reduced root system and let @xmath30 stand for the root lattice for @xmath0 .",
    "suppose @xmath111 is the set of simple roots ( for some choice of a chamber for r ) and let @xmath112 be the simple reflection corresponding to @xmath113 ( we will assume that @xmath114 for some natural number @xmath4 ) ; then @xmath115 , @xmath116 , stands for the coroot corresponding to @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath118 denote the set of fundamental coweights , where @xmath119 , and @xmath120 is the standard pairing between coweights and weights for @xmath0 .",
    "we write @xmath59 for the weyl group of @xmath0 ( note that earlier we were writing @xmath31 instead ) .",
    "let @xmath32 and consider @xmath121 , the weyl orbit of @xmath34 ; write @xmath35 for the convex hull of @xmath36 in @xmath37 . fix a root @xmath38 in @xmath0 and denote by @xmath39 the corresponding coroot .",
    "suppose that @xmath40 is such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we would like to prove that @xmath122 .",
    "but , before we start the proof , we make a few reductions .",
    "first , by possibly choosing a different chamber of @xmath0 , we can assume that @xmath38 is a simple root , and we will therefore denote the latter by @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is some element in @xmath125 .",
    "second , it is clear that we may take @xmath34 to be dominant , since we are considering the convex hull of its orbit @xmath36 under @xmath59 , and for some @xmath126 we must have that @xmath127 is dominant .",
    "finally , we claim that it suffices to prove the theorem under the assumption that @xmath128 is dominant ; indeed , if @xmath128 is not dominant , then we can find @xmath126 such that @xmath129 is dominant , and we can apply the theorem to @xmath129 to find that @xmath130 , and therefore @xmath122 .",
    "the idea of the proof is as follows .",
    "first , notice that @xmath137 in fact , we know that there exists a unique @xmath138 such that @xmath139 is dominant , and since @xmath34 is assumed to be dominant and @xmath35 is invariant under the action of @xmath59 , we get that @xmath140      now we begin with the proof itsef . from the way @xmath43 was defined , we see that @xmath141 and @xmath142 then condition ( iii ) immediately gives @xmath143 and , since @xmath144 , or more precisely since @xmath145 is an integer ( this is where we are using the fact that we are working with the root lattice and not the weight lattice ! ) , the relation ( iii ) also gives @xmath146 thus @xmath147            since @xmath156 can only happen for non - simply - laced root systems , we can conclude that @xmath43 is always dominant for a simply - laced root system r and , by what we wrote above , the lemma is true for such an r.              let us now assume that ( [ i_1 ] ) holds .",
    "our aim is to find @xmath138 so that @xmath139 is dominant .",
    "we first apply the simple reflection @xmath170 to bring @xmath43 `` closer '' to the dominant weyl chamber .",
    "if we write @xmath171 we see that @xmath172 , so @xmath173 and it is also easy to check that @xmath174 , for @xmath175 .",
    "note that if @xmath167 , then @xmath176 is always dominant , because if ( [ i_2 ] ) holds then @xmath180 must be different from both @xmath123 and @xmath181 , but this can not happen since @xmath29 has only two simple roots .",
    "so , for @xmath29 , @xmath182 .",
    "now we assume that ( [ i_1 ] ) and ( [ i_2 ] ) hold .",
    "we write @xmath187 so @xmath188 , and therefore @xmath189 it is easy to see that @xmath190 , for @xmath191 .",
    "we then get that @xmath192 is not dominant if and only if @xmath193 note that if @xmath194 as above exists , then it is unique . clearly , for @xmath195      in any case , if @xmath192 is not dominant , we then apply @xmath199 to it , to get @xmath200 and hence @xmath201 again @xmath202 , for @xmath203 and @xmath204 is not dominant if and only if @xmath205 ( if @xmath206 as above exists , then it must be unique . )",
    "if ( [ i_4 ] ) holds , then we consider @xmath207 .",
    "if @xmath208 is dominant , then the process of finding @xmath198 stops here , otherwise , we see that @xmath209 ( if @xmath210 as above exists , then it must be unique . )",
    "suppose for a contradiction that @xmath225 .",
    "then , since @xmath226 satisfies ( [ zsmaller ] ) , we get that @xmath227 for some non - negative integers @xmath228 . but",
    "@xmath34 is dominant , so @xmath229 , and also @xmath230 .",
    "thus , since @xmath228 s are non - negative , we have @xmath231 . but",
    "this contradicts our assumption ( b ) and therefore we must have @xmath232 .",
    "assume now that @xmath233 , for some @xmath234 .",
    "then , for similar reasons to those above , we can write @xmath235 for some non - negative integers @xmath236 . since @xmath34 is dominant , @xmath237 , and @xmath236 s are non - negative , we see that @xmath238 , each time @xmath239 , or else ( c ) would be contradicted .",
    "condition ( d ) gives @xmath240 , so @xmath241 .",
    "we now get that @xmath242 for some non - negative integers @xmath236 . from ( d ) we have @xmath243 , and so , because @xmath34 is dominant , @xmath236 s are non - negative , and the non - diagonal entries @xmath244 of the so - called cartan matrix are not positive , we conclude , using ( c ) , that @xmath245 , or equivalently @xmath246      _ as was apparent in the proof of lemma 1.1 , @xmath43 is always dominant for simply - laced root systems , but it may fail to be dominant for the other root systems . however , when @xmath43 fails to be dominant , finding a @xmath249 so that @xmath139 is dominant was easier for some root systems than for others . more specifically , if @xmath43 is not dominant , then @xmath219 for certain distinct @xmath213 s , and the number @xmath250 depends on the root systems . call _ the defect of @xmath43 _ the number @xmath250 of simple reflections , as in the proof of lemma 1.1 , required to make @xmath43 dominant .",
