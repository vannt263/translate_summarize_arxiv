    "fast radio bursts ( frbs ) are recently discovered transient sources of unknown origin ( @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "they were detected around @xmath1 ghz with a typical duration of @xmath2 s. their location at high galactic latitudes ( @xmath3 ) and high dispersion measurements ( dm@xmath4 pc @xmath5 ) suggest propagation through the intergalactic medium and high redshifts .",
    "the observed radio fluences and the cosmological distances imply a total energy realise in radio waves of about @xmath6 erg and luminosities of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "the extremely rapid variability points to relativistic beaming , so the linear size of the source would be @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the lorentz factor of the source that is moving towards the observer @xcite .",
    "the brightness temperatures associated with such compact and bright sources are extremely high : @xmath11 k ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "this is well above the compton limit for incoherent synchrotron radiation . a coherent origin of the radiation ,",
    "then , seems to be unquestionable .",
    "additional constraints on the source can be obtained if we assume that the ultimate origin of the radiation is magnetic",
    ". a lower limit on the magnetic field that sets the particle flow in motion is @xmath12 @xcite . even for large beaming , frbs seem to be produced by compact objects of stellar origin such as neutron stars , magnetars or gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "in fact , a number of models have been proposed in relation to such objects : delayed collapses of supermassive neutron stars to black holes @xcite , magnetar flares @xcite , mergers of binary white dwarfs @xcite , flaring stars @xcite , and short grbs @xcite .",
    "the radiation mechanism for the coherent emission is unknown .    in this article",
    "we propose that frbs are generated through coherent emission produced by a relativistic jet . under some rather general conditions ,",
    "beamed electrons interacting with self - excited strong turbulence produce collective radiation .",
    "the emission is generated by the interaction of the electrons with cavitons , which are the result of beam - excited langmuir turbulence in a plasma traversed by the jet .",
    "this radiation mechanism , previously observed in laboratory experiments , has been studied in the context of intraday variability of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) jets @xcite .    in the next section we present the basics of our model and show that it can explain the main features of frbs .",
    "then , in sect . [ sources ] , we discuss a possible astrophysical scenario where our proposed mechanism might work . in sect . [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss our results , the problem of radio wave attenuation , and the sensitivity of our model to the different physical parameters .",
    "we close with a brief summary in sect .",
    "[ conclusions ] .",
    "the interaction of a relativistic electron beam with a target made out of plasma results , through plasma instabilities , in the generation of strong turbulence .",
    "this induced turbulence can be characterised as an ensemble of soliton - like wave packets , called _ cavitons _",
    "( @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "these cavitons result from an equilibrium between the total pressure and the ponderomotive force , which causes a separation of electrons and ions .",
    "the cavity is then filled by a strong electrostatic field @xmath13 .",
    "this effect has been verified both in the lab ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) and through numerical simulations ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "electrons passing through a caviton will radiate because they are accelerated by the electrostatic field , launching a broadband electromagnetic wave packet .",
    "the acceleration of the electrons of the beam in the soliton field results in the superposition of the radiation of each electron .",
    "the main contribution is produced by those cavitons with perpendicular orientation which yields perpendicular electron acceleration .",
    "if the beam is uniform , the out - coming emission is not coherent .",
    "however , when some degree of inhomogeneity exists in the beam density , coherent radiation is produced .",
    "the laboratory experiments clearly show that collective radiation processes occur when relativistic electrons are scattered by the cavitons ; the electrons then produce a bremsstrahlung - type of radiation of coherent nature @xcite .",
    "if a magnetic field is present , the cavitons can be aspherical , yielding further circular polarised emission ( even in the absence of a magnetic field some degree of polarization is expected due to random fluctuations of the size of the cavitons in the turbulent medium ) .",
    "the condition for the collective radiatiation mechanism to operate is that the ratio of beam to plasma densities be no smaller than 0.01 @xcite .",
    "this constraint arises in laboratory experiments that showed that bunching in the beam depends strongly on the ratio of beam to background plasma densities @xcite ; a theoretical analysis for this effect is presented in @xcite . for the case of a power - law density fluctuation spectrum ( as expected in several turbulent regimes ) , the resulting radiation is also a power - law .",
    "the emerging spectrum of the emission is broadband , extending from the plasma frequency @xmath14 up to a cutoff around a few ev .",
    "in addition , the radiation is also relativistically beamed .",
    "for further details on the radiation process , readers are referred to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this emission mechanism has been discussed by @xcite in the context of intraday variability in quasars .",
    "benford showed how the development of cavitons and coherent emission extensively study in the laboratory can also take place in astrophysical sources regardless of the different scales involved .",
    "he argued that despite an astrophysical jet might have an electron energy distribution , i.e. a spread in @xmath15 , the jet velocity is always @xmath16 @xmath17 in the plasma frame , as in experiments , and hence the coherent emission is unavoidable if the approriate conditions in the plasma and beam are satisfied .",
    "we propose that the interaction of a leptonic relativistic jet with a denser plasma cloud induces strong turbulence within the latter ; the electrons then scatter with the cavitons producing radiation .",
    "the presence of density inhomogeneities in the jet causes the emission to be coherent .",
    "this latter condition is easily fulfilled because there is always some level of density inhomogeneity in astrophysical fluids , given the high reynolds number of the flows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a sketch of the physical situation is presented in figure  [ scheme ] . in this system",
    "the required condition for collective emission is @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 the jet and cloud densities , respectively .",
    "the minimum radiation frequency is set by the requirement that it must exceed the plasma frequency : @xmath21 hz . for a density of @xmath22 @xmath5 the plasma frequency is @xmath23 ghz , which corresponds to the observing frequency of frbs .    for illustration purposes , we adopt the values listed in table  [ table 1 ] for the main parameters of our model ( see sect .  [ sources ] for a discussion of the parameters ) .",

    "then ,    @xmath38     where @xmath39 is the temperature of the cloud of plasma ( see sect .",
    "[ parameters ] for further discussion , this temperature is ussually uncertain by an order of magnitude ) .",
    "the impact of the jet on the denser plasma produces a shock that propagates in the direction of the jet motion and heats the cloud , which violently expands and is destroyed on timescales given by ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath40    with @xmath41 , and @xmath42 the radius of the cloud .",
    "this yields @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 .",
    "the pressure exerted by the jet will also accelerate the cloud to relativistic speed on a timescale of    @xmath46    which is also much longer than @xmath45 .",
    "the other fundamental timescale of the system is the time in which electrons radiate coherently ; this scale is determined by the crossing time of the cloud , and dictates the duration of the event . in the laboratory frame , the crossing time is given by :    @xmath47    both dynamical timescales , @xmath43 and @xmath48 , are far longer than the duration of the frb given , in our model , by the crossing time @xmath49 .",
    "this means that the radiative phenomena , and not the dynamical disruption of the cloud , are relevant to the evolution of the frb .",
    "it is worth noticing that the crossing time and the clump radius are consistent with the upper limit imposed on the linear size of the source by the rapid variability .",
    "two shocks will be formed in the jet - cloud system that might re - accelerate particles . however , the timescale of the coherent losses of electrons is shorter than the timescale of acceleration even for relatively strong magnetic fields .",
    "for instance , if the magnetic field in the cloud has a value of @xmath50 g , we get @xmath51s .",
    "this means that in the presence of cavitons , electron re - acceleration fails and they only emit coherently .",
    "only protons can be efficiently accelerated in the cloud , but their emission through the @xmath52 channel is too weak to be detectable .",
    "the radiated power per electron in the coherent region is given by @xcite :    @xmath53 ,     \\ ] ]    where @xmath54 is the mean squared density fluctuation in the jet , @xmath13 is the value of the electric field inside the cavitons , and @xmath55 is the fraction of the cloud volume filled with cavitons .",
    "this fraction is a free parameter in our model ; we adopt @xmath56 , consistently with experiments that showed that @xmath55 can be as high as @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "we adopt density fluctuations of the order of 1% , that is @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath13 can be estimated by the condition that allows the formation of the cavitons , that is the electric energy must be greater than the thermal energy , i.e. @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "a broad spectrum of density fluctuations will develop from the jet modulation through non - linear effects , of mean density @xmath60 ; we take @xmath61 , as in @xcite .",
    "we consider the energy ratio to be @xmath62 , obtaining : @xmath63    the total power @xmath64 is calculated as the power emitted per particle times the number of relativistic electrons inside the cloud s volume , @xmath65 .",
    "this results in    @xmath66    here , we have considered @xmath67 , in accordance with the condition imposed by the radiative mechanism @xcite .",
    "the fluences of the detected bursts at @xmath68 ghz are @xmath69  jy  ms @xcite . assuming an event of average fluence @xmath70 1  jy  ms , with a duration of @xmath71  ms , at a distance of @xmath72  gpc , the intrinsic luminosity is @xmath73  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "for a source characterized by the parameters of table [ table ] , our model can account for the high fluences observed . in sect .",
    "[ sources ] we discuss possible astrophysical sources with these parameters .    as mentioned above , the coherent emission is broad band , extending from the plasma frequency @xmath14 up to @xmath74 . for @xmath75 ,",
    "this yields :    @xmath76    therefore @xmath77 ev , which is in the uv band .",
    "the absorption in the interstellar and intergalactic medium suppresses the emission above the radio band .",
    "the radio flux , however , can be affected by plasma effects in the source ( see sect .",
    "[ discussion ] ) .",
    "recent bright grbs detected with the _ fermi _ satellite imply bulk lorentz factors of @xmath78 .",
    "these limits arise from the so - called `` compactness problem '' .",
    "such high lorentz factors are necessary in order gev photons to escape from the source ( e.g. , @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) . even when applying more conservative models to describe the events , values of @xmath79 are obtained ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "grbs involve , then , the fastest bulk motions known to occur in the universe .    on the other hand , massive progenitor stars of long grbs , such as wolf - rayet stars , have strong winds with a clumpy structure ( e.g. , @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "once the star implodes , one or more clumps can be reached by the jet , because of the relative high filling factor @xcite .",
    "the interaction of clumps and/or clouds with jets , along with strong turbulence generation , produces different phenomena such as particle acceleration , non - thermal emission , etc .",
    "( see @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we propose here that the interaction of a long grb jet with the clumped , residual wind of its progenitor can lead to the coherent emission previously discussed .",
    "the density of a clump in the wind of a wolf - rayet star can reach very high values , similar to those expected in the atmosphere of massive stars ( @xmath80 @xmath5 , @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "as these clumps move away from the star , they expand and their density decrease to values similar to the ones adopted in our model .",
    "on the other hand , the jet density is determined by the luminosity of the grb , and it also decreases with the distance to the central source . for typical grb luminosities of @xmath81 erg s@xmath8 , and interaction distances of @xmath82 cm",
    "( this is located near the region where the afterglow emission is produced ) , the density can easily reach values of @xmath83 , which are necessary for the proposed mechanism to operate . since the interaction between the clump and the jet should occur far enough to the central engine , the radio coherent emission is not screened neither by the dense stellar envelope nor the grb prompt emission .    finally , we note that the fraction @xmath84 of the jet kinetic energy of a grb transferred into the collective emission is @xmath85 ; this is a rather slim value of @xmath84 , considering the theoretical upper limits obtained in @xcite , that give @xmath86 .",
    "the energetic requirements for this implementation of our mechanism are , then , not very demanding .",
    "coherent radiation processes have been claimed to suffer severe attenuation by various absorption mechanisms in the context of agns ( e.g. , @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the brightness temperature can be saturated by induced compton scattering and/or raman scattering ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite argued that confrontation of induced compton absorption with plasma experiment suggests that there is no observed saturation effect for high @xmath87 .",
    "regarding raman scattering , the theoretical approach in @xcite applies only to weakly turbulent environments .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate , however , can be obtained .",
    "strong raman scattering dominates other decay processes of langmuir waves if @xcite :    @xmath88    where @xmath89 is the plasma density in units of @xmath90 @xmath5 , @xmath91 is the frequency of the radio emission is ghz , and @xmath92 is the brightness temperature in units of @xmath93 k.    the brightness temperature @xmath87 can be calculated as follows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath94    for a typical burst , @xmath95  k. with these values condition ( [ uno ] ) holds .",
    "however , experiments can produce effective brightness temperatures in excess of @xmath96 k using laser - like devices to stimulate a hot plasma @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy between theory and experiment might arise in the fact that the above calculation is based on the weak - turbulence limit , which is not adequate to describe the situation under consideration here .",
    "we conclude that there is no reason , in the absence of a comprehensive theory of strong langmuir turbulence , to rule out our model given the experimental results .",
    "in our model we consider that a cloud of plasma interacting with the relativistic jet produces the required density rarefaction for the generation of cavitons ; however regions of very high density in the jet can be formed by other processes , like internal shocks , instabilities , etc . in these cases the coherent emission resulting from electron - caviton scattering might also be obtained .",
    "a different scenario might be associated with the minijets that are produced by dissipation of magnetic energy in a larger jet @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the jet of a misaligned agn , a minijet pointing towards the observer can impact with a cloud from the broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "these clouds have high densities , typical sizes of @xmath97 cm @xcite and temperatures @xmath98k @xcite .",
    "the jets of agns have lorentz factors @xmath99 , however minijets might be much faster ( lorentz factors @xmath100 , with @xmath101 200 , @xcite ) . with these parameters the values for @xmath49 and the total power do not differ significantly from those obtained in the case discussed in sect.[emi ] .",
    "beam decollimation might occur in astrophysical jets .",
    "decollimation into an angle @xmath102 will not affect the collective emission until @xmath103 , but then emission will drop greatly if @xmath104 @xcite .",
    "such high angles are not expected in the astrophysical scenario presented here .",
    "multiple frbs from one source depend on the filling factor of clouds . for a value of 0.1 ,",
    "the probability of having multiple independent interactions is @xmath70 @xmath50 .",
    "even if there is a multiple interaction , it would appear as a bit longer frb ( @xmath105  s ) with some structure , as recently observed @xcite .    in a recent frb detected in real time , petroff and co - workers @xcite",
    "have measured circular polarisation of @xmath106% , and established an upper limit on linear polarization of @xmath107 % ( with @xmath108 of significance ) .",
    "there are at least two ways of producing circular polarization : 1 ) in a jet composed by electron / positron pairs , circular polarisation might be due to faraday conversion ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) ; 2 ) in case that some cyclotron modes scatter with the jet , higher levels of circular polarisation are expected .",
    "both effects can contribute to the high degree of circular polarisation reported by @xcite .",
    "the radiation mechanism we are proposing might produce linear polarisation as well @xcite .",
    "the low levels of linear polarisation detected may be due to faraday rotation as proposed in @xcite .",
    "effects of external plasma , such as propagation effects ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , can be also invoked to explain the existence of some spectral features claimed to be present ( e.g. , bright bands of a width @xmath109 mhz , @xcite ) .",
    "the first evidence of a two - component frb disfavors models that resort to a single high energy event involving compact objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) . our model , on the contrary ,",
    "can easily explain two components or a structured time profile by multiple interactions of different clumps with the jet .",
    "it can also account for two frbs being produced by the same repeating source , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent investigations conclude that frbs arise in dense star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ,  @xcite ) , precisely where massive stars with clumpy winds are expected .",
    "another aspect to be briefly discussed is the potential correlation between long grbs and frbs .",
    "no such a correlation has been observed so far , but with only around 10 events detected this is not surprising at all .",
    "notice that the interaction might occur at some distance from the region where the gamma - rays are produce , hence the grb and the frb are not exactly simultaneous .",
    "in addition , the deceleration of the jet makes the beaming angle of the radio emission larger than that of the gamma - ray flux , making the grbs more difficult to be detected in comparison to the frbs .",
    "finally , not all grbs are expected to gather the adequate environment or jet conditions for producing the frb phenomenon .",
    "the luminosity and event duration in our model depend on the characteristics of the target plasma ( clump)these are properties such as clump size , density , and temperature and the jet parameters density and lorentz factor. here we discuss the sensitivity of our results to these parameters .",
    "the detection frequency of frbs imposes an upper limit to the density of the cloud in our model ( as discussed in sect .",
    "[ scenario ] ) ; hence denser clumps might emit at higher frequencies , beyond the radio band , and are discarded .",
    "the density value we adopted is reasonable for a clump of the wind of a massive star ( such as a wolf - rayet ) .    in the application of our model",
    "we have adopted a density ratio @xmath110 ; the required condition for collective emission is @xmath111 , since @xmath112 is a lower limit to the density ratio , bigger values can be adopted .",
    "if we consider , for example , @xmath113 , we obtain detectable fluxes for smaller clumps ( @xmath114 cm ) , and jets with lower lorentz factors ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "clumps smaller than @xmath116  cm might produce undetectable fluxes .    clumpy structures in the wind of massive stars develop close to the surface of the star , with typical sizes of @xmath117  cm .",
    "we have adopted a larger clump s size of @xmath118  cm .",
    "this value is justified by the fact that the clump - jet interaction in our model takes place far from the central source , and at such distances the clump is expected to naturally expand .",
    "in addition , in the later stages before the final collapse of evolved stars , massive ejections occur from the outer atmosphere , as observed in the case of eta carina .",
    "we have adopted a temperature of the clump of @xmath119  k , which corresponds to the temperature of massive star winds @xcite .",
    "this is a very conservative value , since stellar winds are known to emit even soft x - rays .",
    "this implies that the plasma can reach temperatures of @xmath120  k ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "incrementing the temperature one order of magnitude increases approximately one order of magnitude the resulting luminosity ; in this way , by adopting a hotter clump other parameters can be relaxed , such as the clump s size and/or the jet s lorentz factor .",
    "we conclude , then , that there is a wide range of parameters over which our model is able to reproduce the main features observed so far in frbs .",
    "we propose a model where frbs are the result of the interaction of relativistic jets with plasma condensations . in this context",
    ", the jet induces strong turbulence in the cloud , exciting langmuir waves . in the strong turbulence regime cavitons",
    "are formed , filling a substantial part of the volume of the cloud . in the presence of an inhomogeneous jet , these cavitons coherently scatter electrons with lorentz factors of @xmath109 producing radiation up to a frequency of @xmath121 , with @xmath34 the size of the cavitons .",
    "the result is a radio flare with an effective brightness temperature exceeding @xmath122  k , and a duration of @xmath123 s in the observer reference system .",
    "if the jet density fluctuations have a power - law distribution , the resulting radiation can have a power - law spectra as the synchrotron radiation , but it is not restricted by the high brightness temperatures derived assuming incoherent emission .",
    "we suggest that these events can account for at least a fraction of the frbs .",
    "several possible scenarios can accommodate this mechanism . among them , we briefly discussed jets of long grbs colliding with inhomogeneities of the wind of the progenitor star or the warm component of the ism .",
    "other possible scenarios for the proposed mechanism will be discussed elsewhere .",
