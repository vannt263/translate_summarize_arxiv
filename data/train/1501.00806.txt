    "soon after the bohr - mottelson model ( bmm ) @xcite was proposed for nuclear structure together with its first solution @xcite for spherical nuclei , many attempts were done to improve and extend it by taking into account axial and non axial deformation , coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath1 vibrations or various anharmonicities .",
    "most of these approaches were reviewed in refs.@xcite . a new phase in the field begun with the studies of the phase transitions by means of the classical limits of hamiltonians constructed from operators belonging to compact lie algebras @xcite .",
    "this algorithm was further used in @xcite to associate classical shape variables to the interacting boson model ( ibm ) @xcite and allowed to establish the nature of the quantum phase transition @xcite between the dynamical symmetries , namely , u(5 ) ( spherical vibrator ) , o(6 ) ( @xmath1-unstable ) and su(3 ) ( axial rotor ) .",
    "the start of a long series of studies , both theoretical and experimental , was given mainly by two papers in which approximate solutions of the bmm were offered for the critical points of the shape phase transitions u(5)-o(6 ) and u(5)-su(3 ) , called e(5 ) @xcite and x(5 ) @xcite , respectively .",
    "other two important models which are worth mentioning here are y(5 ) @xcite and z(5 ) @xcite associated with the transitions between the axial and triaxial shapes and respectively between prolate and oblate shapes .",
    "the critical point approaches mentioned above have the advantage to be parameter free solutions except for a scaling factor , making them easily verifiable reference points for the experimental data .",
    "this is actually a general trait of the exactly solvable models of nuclei @xcite .",
    "other efforts were also directed to special realisations of the bmm in the view of some constraints imposed on the shape variables or inertial parameters .",
    "for example `` freezing '' the @xmath1 variable to a certain value in the classical bmm , leads after quantization in curvilinear coordinates to simpler hamiltonians suitable to describe the special case of the @xmath1 rigid collective motion .",
    "the first study in this direction brought to light the davydov - chaban model for rotation - vibration interaction in non - axial nuclei @xcite .",
    "later on , an exact solution for this model was proposed @xcite in the case of @xmath6 , where instead of a displaced harmonic oscillator in @xmath0 shape variable an infinite square well potential was used .",
    "the solution called z(4 ) due to the similarity to the z(5 ) model , inspired other studies of the @xmath1 rigid solutions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose an analytical solution for the davydov - chaban hamiltonian @xcite with @xmath6 and a sextic potential for the only shape variable , i.e. @xmath0 . the model is conventionally called z(4)-sextic . in this framework , the separation of the angular variables from the @xmath0 shape variable is exact .",
    "the differential equation involving euler angles is solved as in ref.@xcite , while that for @xmath0 is brought to a schrdinger form with a sextic potential and a centrifugal - like term .",
    "the problem of the sextic potential is not an exactly solvable one because its spectral problem is reduced to the diagonalization of an infinite - dimensional hamiltonian matrix .",
    "however , for a family of potentials whose coefficients satisfy certain relations between them and the factor of the centrifugal term , the problem becomes quasi - exactly solvable @xcite , i.e. its infinite hamiltonian matrix acquire a block diagonal form allowing thus an algebraic treatment for a finite subset of eigenstates . for a physically meaning description ,",
    "the above mentioned constraints must be corroborated also with the condition of constant potential . despite these restrictions ,",
    "the z(4)-sextic eigenvalue problem is exactly solved for the ground and @xmath0 bands . concerning the @xmath1 band ,",
    "an approximation is involved in the centrifugal term in order to accommodate all the above restrictions . due to the scaling property of the exactly solvable sextic potential with an associated centrifugal term , the energy and the @xmath3 transitions depend on a single parameter up to an overall scaling factor . moreover , for particularly interesting shapes of the potential , parameter free expressions are possible for the normalized energies and @xmath3 transition probabilities .",
    "the use of such an involved potential is supported by the fact that it is the simplest shape which through continuous variation of its parameters can have either a spherical minimum , a deformed minimum or both .",
    "it is worth to mention that exact @xcite and approximate @xcite solutions by using a sextic potential were also given , in five dimensions , for e(5 ) and respectively x(5 ) and z(5 ) related approaches .",
    "other solutions in the vicinity of @xmath6 , but with @xmath1 soft can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "the present work has the following plan .",
    "the z(4)-sextic model hamiltonian is presented in section ii , while its associated @xmath0 differential equation is treated in section iii . in section iv ,",
    "one gives the model wave functions and calculate the @xmath3 transition probabilities .",
    "extensive numerical results and few model fits to experimental data are given in section v. the main conclusions are drawn in section vi .",
    "the eigenvalue problem , when the nucleus is @xmath7rigid , has the following form @xcite : @xmath8\\psi(\\beta,\\omega)+v(\\beta)\\psi(\\beta,\\omega)=e\\psi(\\beta,\\omega ) , \\label{hi}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the mass parameter , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath10 are the intrinsic deformation coordinates and respectively the operators of the total angular momentum projections in the intrinsic reference frame , while with @xmath11 are denoted the rotation euler angles @xmath12 . here , @xmath1 is considered a parameter and not a variable , such that when the kinetic energy of the classical bmm is quantized in curvilinear coordinates one arrives at the hamiltonian ( [ hi ] ) which depends only on four variables @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath14 , two moments of inertia in the intrinsic reference frame become equal and then the rotational term reads : @xmath15 the separation of variables is achieved by considering the wave function @xmath16 which leads to the following equation in @xmath0 variable : @xmath17\\phi(\\beta)=\\varepsilon\\phi(\\beta ) , \\label{eqbeta}\\ ] ] where the following notations are used @xmath18 and @xmath19 , while @xmath20 is the eigenvalue for the equation of the angular part , @xmath21 the above equation was solved in ref.@xcite with the results : @xmath22 and @xmath23 . \\label{ang}\\ ] ] here @xmath24 are the wigner functions associated to the total angular momentum @xmath25 and its projections on the body fixed x - axis and laboratory fixed z - axis , @xmath26 and respectively @xmath27 . for the energy spectrum",
    "it is more advantageous to use instead of @xmath26 the wobbling quantum number @xmath28 which for the ground and @xmath0 bands is @xmath29 , while for the @xmath1 band it takes the values @xmath30 for @xmath25 odd and @xmath31 for @xmath25 even . within this convention the eigenvalue of the angular part of the problem",
    "is written as @xmath32",
    "it is convenient to bring eq .",
    "( [ eqbeta ] ) to a schrdinger form .",

( [ ecschr ] ) is compared with the exactly solvable case of the sextic potential @xcite which leads to the following correspondences : @xmath35 @xmath36\\beta^{2}+2ab\\beta^{4}+a^{2}\\beta^{6}. \\label{vbeta}\\ ] ] the potential ( [ vbeta ] ) depends on two parameters , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and on @xmath25 and @xmath39 quantum numbers through @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is a natural number which establishes the number of states that can be determined .",
    "this implication will be explained later when discussing the wave functions .",
    "the number of parameters is reduced to a single one by changing the variable with @xmath42 . then by introducing the notations @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    "one gets : @xmath45\\eta(y)=\\varepsilon_{y}\\eta(y ) , \\label{eqy}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 because @xmath40 depends on @xmath25 and @xmath39 , the potential of eq .",
    "( [ eqy ] ) is state dependent . for the ground and @xmath0 bands",
    "@xmath47 , such that @xmath48 in order to have a state invariant potential for this case of ground and @xmath0 band states , the following condition must be satisfied : @xmath49 it can be easily checked that the above condition is satisfied if @xmath41 is decreased with one unit when @xmath25 is increased with four .",
    "this means that for @xmath50 even and @xmath50 odd there are two different constants @xmath51 : @xmath52 which differ from each other just by @xmath53 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath54 puts a limit on the number of states which might be determined .",
    "for example if @xmath55 , the maximum angular momentum state which could be analytically described would be the @xmath56 state , while for @xmath57 , the @xmath58 state and so on .",
    "this is actually a direct consequence of the condition ( [ cond ] ) . in case of the @xmath1 band , when @xmath59 and 2 , @xmath40 becomes irrational such that the eq.([eqy ] ) can not be solved anymore for @xmath41 integer and with constant potential condition fulfilled .",
    "a possible way to handle this problem is to extract from the centrifugal term the quantities @xmath60 and @xmath61 for @xmath25 odd and respectively @xmath25 even , and to replace @xmath62 with its average @xmath63 on @xmath64 eigenstates of the remaining hamiltonian for each angular momentum @xmath25 . with these approximations , @xmath40 and @xmath51 from the @xmath1 band",
    "will have the same expressions ( [ sc ] ) as in the case of ground and @xmath0 bands .",
    "moreover , for @xmath25 even states of the @xmath1 band , @xmath51 will have the same two values as for the ground and @xmath0 bands . while for @xmath25 odd , @xmath51 will have other two values : @xmath65 corresponding to @xmath66 even and respectively @xmath66 odd .",
    "finally , the four values of the constant @xmath51 can be summarized by the formula : @xmath67 the condition of the constant potential is then exactly satisfied for four distinct sets of states , which correspond to slightly different potentials .",
    "this picture is improved by considering for the general potential the following form : @xmath68 for a fixed @xmath69 , @xmath70 are constants depending on @xmath71 , which are fixed such that the minimum energy of the potentials @xmath72 to be the same . choosing @xmath73 , the other constants are given by : @xmath74+\\left(y_{0,0}^{k}\\right)^{6}-\\left(y_{0,i}^{k}\\right)^{6},\\nonumber\\ ] ] with @xmath75 and @xmath76 being the minimum points : @xmath77 taking the ansatz function @xcite @xmath78 the eq .",
    "( [ eqy ] ) is then reduced to the following differential equation , @xmath79p_{m}(y^{2})=\\lambda p_{m}(y^{2 } ) , \\label{eqq}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 are polynomials in @xmath62 of order @xmath41 .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath81 are obtained for each @xmath41 using the analytical procedure given in appendix of ref.@xcite . for each value of @xmath41",
    "there are @xmath82 solutions which are differentiated by the @xmath0 vibrational quantum number @xmath83 in the following way : the lowest eigenvalue @xmath81 corresponds to @xmath84 , while the highest to @xmath85 . for the present physical problem",
    "only the solutions with @xmath86 and @xmath87 will be considered , which correspond to the ground and @xmath1 bands and respectively to the @xmath0 band states .",
    "@xmath81 also depends on @xmath25 through @xmath40 and one must remind that at this point @xmath25 and @xmath41 are interdependent through the condition ( [ cond ] ) , the actual relationship being dictated by the value of @xmath69 . thus , the @xmath41 indexing of @xmath81 will be replaced from here by @xmath69 .",
    "following all the algebraic manipulations which lead to eq.([eqq ] ) and taking into account the above considerations , @xmath81 can be alternatively expressed as : @xmath88 from the above relation one finally extracts the total energy of the system : @xmath89 , \\label{ener}\\ ] ] which is indexed by the @xmath0 vibration and wobbling quantum numbers @xmath83 and @xmath39 , as well as by the intrinsic angular momentum @xmath25 .",
    "the index @xmath90 is completely determined only by @xmath25 . although the above energy also depends on the integer @xmath69 , this is not a true quantum number but rather a special kind of parameter .",
    "similarly to the eigenvalue @xmath81 , the associated eigenfunctions of eq.([eqq ] ) also depend on @xmath69 and @xmath25 .",
    "such that due to the orthogonality of the angular wave functions ( [ ang ] ) , the average of @xmath91 entering in the definition of the total energy are only @xmath69 and @xmath25 dependent . from eq.([ener ] ) one can see that the energy spectrum normalized to the energy of the first excited state depends only on the parameter @xmath71 and the integer @xmath69 . for further calculations",
    "one defines the energy ratios : @xmath92 for a fixed value of @xmath69 .",
    "as was explained in section ii , the total wave function is factorized into an angular part and a @xmath0 depending factor function : @xmath93 where the angular factor state was defined by eq.([ang ] ) keeping the notation with @xmath26 instead of @xmath39 for convenience in calculating angular matrix elements . in what concerns the @xmath0 wave function",
    ", it has the following form : @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 being the normalization constant with respect to the @xmath97 integration measure .",
    "as was already mentioned when the expression of the total energy was discussed , @xmath41 is uniquely determined by @xmath25 for a fixed value of @xmath69 .",
    "thus , a more natural dependence of the total wave function would be on @xmath69 instead of @xmath41 .",
    "however @xmath41 express more intuitively the analytical form of the @xmath0 factor state .",
    "fixed at @xmath98 and with @xmath55 , corresponding to @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 are plotted as function of @xmath103.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    having the analytical expression of the total wave function , one can readily compute the @xmath3 transition probabilities . the quadrupole operator for z(4)-sextic",
    "has the same form as for the z(4 ) solution @xcite , @xmath104    the reduced @xmath105 transition probabilities are defined as : @xmath106 where the rose s convention @xcite was used for the reduced matrix elements .",
    "the matrix elements over the @xmath0 can be rewritten in terms of @xmath103 with the following result : @xmath107",
    "as its construction is suggesting , the z(4)-sextic model , introduced in the previous sections , is adequate for the description of triaxial nuclei having a @xmath1 rigidity of @xmath2 .",
    "the model depends on a single parameter @xmath71 , apart from a scaling factor and the integer number @xmath69 which gives the extension of the exactly solvable subspace .",
    "depending on the free parameter @xmath71 and regardless of the @xmath69 value , the sextic potential ( [ poty ] ) may have a spherical minimum @xmath108 , a deformed one @xmath109 and simultaneously spherical and deformed minima @xmath110 for all considered states .",
    "these situations are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for @xmath55 where one also showed the particular cases of @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 with the latter one corresponding to a potential shape close to that of the infinite square well .",
    "the different constants @xmath114 used for the four distinct sets of states depending on the parity of @xmath50 or @xmath66 , define some small extension intervals where few of the above solutions coexists for different states .",
    "if all the constants @xmath114 would be equal , the coexisting intervals would shrink to a single point value of @xmath71 .",
    "the advantage of the present model s dependence on a single parameter is that one can study how its characteristics are changed between the pictures discussed above by continuously varying the free parameter . in order to do this and cover all the above mentioned cases ,",
    "the energy ratios ( [ enrat ] ) and few interband and intraband @xmath3 transitions ( [ tran ] ) normalized to the transition @xmath115 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , respectively , for a sufficiently large interval of @xmath71 in order to achieve convergence at both sides .",
    "the numerical results visualized in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] are performed for @xmath116 and 4 . for each @xmath69",
    "there is a limited number of available states which are exactly determined in the present model .",
    "the number of such states in the ground , @xmath0 , @xmath1 with @xmath25 even and @xmath1 with @xmath25 odd bands increases with two when @xmath69 is increased with one unit .",
    "the common parts of the energy spectra corresponding to different @xmath69 are very similar . however , there are some clear differences , such as the width and the position of the coexistence intervals identified in fig .",

    "indeed , as @xmath69 increases , the grey band becomes thinner and its position moves to higher values of @xmath71 . as a matter of fact in this existence interval",
    ", one observes a kink in the energy curves which happens at a critical value @xmath119 .",
    "this value corresponds to the absolute maximum of the signature ratio @xmath120 and is interpreted as the critical point for a first order shape phase transition between spherical and deformed shapes in the framework of presently adopted sextic potential .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that the first derivative of the energy in the critical point @xmath119 has a discontinuity . as was explained in ref.@xcite , the critical point for",
    "a first order phase transition corresponds to the situation when the spherical and deformed minima of the potential energy are degenerated .",
    "this happens in our case at @xmath119 where the potential shape is the flattest , being extended over a wide range of non zero deformations .",
    "a similar critical point was pointed out in the analysis made in ref .",
    "@xcite regarding a @xmath1 unstable realization of the sextic potential and in ref .",
    "@xcite where a quartic potential was involved .",
    "the fact that the critical value @xmath119 separates two distinct shape phases can also be seen from the behaviour of the wave function .",
    "for example from the dependence of the normalized wave function @xmath121 on @xmath71 and @xmath103 , shown in fig .",
    "[ wf ] , one can see that up to the critical value @xmath119 the position of the peak changes very rapidly , while for @xmath122 its position do not vary significantly .",
    "this suggests that the two shape phases delimited by @xmath119 have different properties .     as function of @xmath103 for @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "the square of this quantity is the probability density for the ground state deformation with respect to the @xmath124 integration measure .",
    "the horizontal red line marks the the wave function behaviour at the critical value @xmath119 .",
    "the evolution of the peak s position with @xmath71 is visualized by another red curve .",

    "[ fig3 ] have a smooth behaviour as function of @xmath71 .",
    "while the @xmath69 variation , induce only a small shift to the right of the curves from fig .",
    "the common feature of the all considered transitions is that their corresponding probabilities become `` @xmath69 degenerate '' for @xmath125 and more sooner for the interband transitions .    as was mentioned before , in the coexistence region , and especially at the critical value @xmath119 , the shape of the potential approximated by @xmath126 is the flattest one ,",
    "which is consistent with critical point behavior .",
    "moreover , the potential at @xmath119 simulates quite well an infinite square well , supported also by the fact that the corresponding energy spectrum is very close to that of z(4 ) model .",
    "another interesting aspect of the present model is that some energy ratios curves of the ground and @xmath0 bands are intersecting each other for @xmath111 and becoming thus degenerate .",
    "this can be seen only starting from @xmath57 , where the last two ground band states @xmath127 and @xmath128 are degenerate with @xmath129 and @xmath130 from the @xmath0 band when @xmath111 .",
    "this degeneracy may reveal some symmetry properties associated with the resulting simple potential shape @xmath131 . the low lying energy spectrum with a complete set of @xmath105 transition probabilities for this special case is graphically represented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for each considered value of @xmath69 .",
    "a similar representation is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for the other special case corresponding to @xmath119 where one also given its numerical value . the parameter free results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] can be used in a first step as reference points for finding candidate nuclei and then to vary @xmath71 for a better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "another important touchstone of the present formalism represents the exact reproduction of the z(4)-@xmath132 model @xcite spectra when @xmath133 .",
    "this means that the ground and @xmath0 bands are degenerated and have a harmonic oscillator type spectrum , while the even and odd angular momentum states of the @xmath1 band deviate from this behavior . in what concerns the other limit , @xmath134",
    ", the ground and @xmath1 band spectra achieve a convergence at a noncollective value of @xmath135 . while the @xmath0 band energy curves go to infinity .",
    "the limiting value @xmath136 is reached at @xmath137 and @xmath138 for @xmath116 and 4 respectively .",
    "a particular signature which is often used as a characteristic of structure and its evolution is the staggering in the @xmath1 band energies @xcite usually given in terms of the quantity @xmath139 which is defined as : @xmath140-\\left[e(l_{\\gamma}-1)-e(l_{\\gamma}-2)\\right]}{e(2_{g}^{+})},\\ ] ] where @xmath141 stands for the absolute energy with respect to the ground state .",

    "[ fig2 ] , one can observe in the ground and @xmath1 bands another interesting phenomenon known as @xmath147 staggering or @xmath148 bifurcation which although very small was reported in the ground bands of actinide and rare earth nuclei @xcite .",

    "the z(4)-sextic and z(4 ) numerical results provide a good agrement with experiment only for the @xmath161 transition , the rest of the transition probabilities being overestimated in both calculations . a possible way to improve the agreement is to add anharmonicities to the transition operator as was made in ref . @xcite . for transitions in the @xmath1 band and from the @xmath1 band to the ground band",
    "both approaches give good results , while for transitions from the @xmath0 band to the ground and @xmath1 bands the agreement is only partially good .",
    "these applications show that these isotopes can be considered partial candidates for z(4)-sextic and z(4 ) .",
    "the good agreement for all three bands of the isotope @xmath158pt proves that these solutions can describe real situations and opens the question if there are better candidates .",
    "the main result of the present work consists in the proposal of a new solution for the davydov - chaban hamiltonian , with a sextic oscillator potential for the variable @xmath0 and @xmath1 `` frozen '' to @xmath2 . the solution is conventionally called z(4)-sextic , in connection with the precedent z(4 ) solution where an infinite square well potential was considered . choosing a quasi - exactly solvable form for the sextic potential ,",
    "a finite set of states was analytically determined .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue problem is exactly solved in the case of ground and @xmath0 bands , while for the @xmath1 band states an approximation is involved .",
    "the difference from the former quasi - exactly solvable sextic potential approaches @xcite , is the introduction of a completely different scheme for angular momentum attribution which satisfy the condition of constant potential .",
    "also it is the first time when the scaling property of the problem is employed to describe the properties of the quasi - exactly solvable sextic potential . indeed ,",
    "as was shown in section iii , the model depends up to a scaling factor on a single parameter . taking advantage of this property",
    ", one studied the evolution of the energy spectra and the corresponding transition probabilities when the free parameter is varied through different shapes of the associated sextic potential . for two values of the free parameter ,",
    "the potential has one vanishing term .",
    "the spectra normalized to the energy of the first exited state and the @xmath3 transitions normalized to the transition between the first excited state and the ground state calculated with the present model for these special cases , constitute parameter independent realizations of the associated simplified sextic potentials .",
    "a detailed comparison to the z(4 ) and z(4)-@xmath132 models , especially in terms of the energy spectrum , revealed that the present formalism approximate quite well the former in its critical point , and exactly reproduces the latter in the asymptotic limit of the free parameter .",
    "these facts suggest the consistency of the approximation used for the treatment of the @xmath1 band states .",
    "numerical applications were performed for @xmath4xe and @xmath5pt isotopes .",
    "the results for the xe isotopes revealed a shape phase transition with its critical point identified with the @xmath155xe nucleus .",
    "the fits have a qualitative character , showing that the experimental realization of triaxial @xmath1 rigidity is very much possible . especially encouraging in this sense",
    "is the reproduction of the @xmath158pt spectrum .    concluding",
    ", one should say that the theoretical value of the proposed model resides in the fact that it adds to the few exactly solvable solutions of the collective model concerning only the ground and @xmath0 bands , while its special cases contribute to the even more restrained set of parameter free models .",
