    "far - infrared ( fir ) magneto - optical absorption spectroscopy is one experimental technique to study electrons confined in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds )  @xcite .",
    "it was , however , realized at the early stage of qd research that fir spectroscopy is unable to reveal interesting many - electron effects in parabolic - confinement qds .",
    "this is because the electromagnetic waves couple only to the center - of - mass variables of electrons .",
    "the resulting fir spectrum is rather simple , showing two branches , @xmath0 , as a function of magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "these branches , one with positive energy dispersion ( @xmath1 ) and one with negative energy dispersion ( @xmath2 ) as a function of magnetic field , are called the kohn modes .",
    "the spectrum does not depend on the number of electrons nor on the interactions between them .",
    "this condition in parabolic qds is called the generalized kohn theorem  @xcite .",
    "the condition can be lifted if the confinement is not parabolic , and many experiments show more complex fir spectra  @xcite .",
    "also calculations  @xcite have shown non - trivial fir spectra of non - parabolic qds . it is also possible that spin - orbit interaction  @xcite and impurities near quantum dots  @xcite can have an effect on the fir spectrum . in a nonparabolic qd , the relative internal motion of electrons could be accessible with the fir spectroscopy , but recent studies suggest that additional features in the fir spectra are still of collective nature  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the observed fir spectra of a nonparabolic qd is usually far from trivial .",
    "it is clear that deviations arise from nonparabolic confinement , but the detailed cause of the deviations , thus the interpretation of spectrum , is not always straightforward .",
    "it is especially interesting to see how many - electron interactions appear in the fir spectra of qds .    in the calculation of fir spectra of two - electron lateral double qd  @xcite and lateral four - minima quantum dot molecule ( qdm )  @xcite it was shown that the deviations from the kohn modes arise mainly from nonparabolic confinement and interactions have only minor effects on the spectra .",
    "effects of relative motion of electrons on fir spectra were studied by turning electron - electron interactions on and off .",
    "the results indicate that the fir spectra of qdms reveal mainly the center - of - mass collective excitations of electrons .",
    "actually more pronounced deviations from kohn modes are observed when interactions between the electrons are turned off .",
    "this is an interesting result , suggesting that less features are observed with more electrons in a non - parabolic qd .",
    "these studies , however , include only two electrons and the fir spectra may depend on particle number .",
    "also as more single - particle levels are occupied the center - of - mass excitations with slightly different energies may be observed where interactions do not , necessarily , have any significant role .",
    "calculations where electron interactions can be turned on and off could show how the electron - electron interactions show up in fir spectra for greater electron numbers ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in this article we study three different lateral quantum dot molecule ( qdm ) confinements .",
    "we study two - minima qdm ( double dot ) , and square - symmetric and rectangular - symmetric four - minima qdms .",
    "we calculate the fir spectra for all the qdm confinements and compare them to the parabolic - confinement qd fir spectrum .",
    "we analyze in detail the effect of electron - electron interactions on the fir spectra .",
    "we use very accurate exact diagonalization technique for interacting electrons but limit our studies to two interacting electrons .",
    "we also calculate the fir spectra of non - interacting electrons up to six electrons by occupying single - particle levels and calculating dipole - transition elements between the single - particle levels .",
    "these provide some insight how fir spectra are modified with greater electron numbers , even if we do not include electron - electron interactions .",
    "especially if excitations are collective also with the greater electron numbers , the fir spectra are basically given by the transitions between single - particle levels of the quantum dot confinement in question .",

    "the spectrum approaches kohn modes and no anticrossings are observed . in the high field region",
    "the electrons are effectively more localized into individual dots  @xcite .",

    "[ fircomb ] ( b ) .",
    "all qdm confinements show anticrossings in @xmath1 .",
    "the clearest anticrossings are seen at low magnetic field strengths . at higher @xmath66",
    "there are still anticrossings but the energy gap is so small that they are not visible in the spectra .",
    "the transition probabilities in the lower panels , however , reveal anticrossings as the transition probability of one mode decreases and the other one increases as a function of magnetic field .",
    "the biggest anticrossing gap in energy is seen with square - symmetric four - minima qdm .",
    "this is interesting , since in our previous studies the square - symmetric four - minima qdm resembled the most a parabolic qd whereas double dot and rectangular four - minima qdm showed greater deviations in the ground state properties and in the low - lying eigenstates  @xcite .",
    "obviously this is not true with the excitation spectrum and with the higher eigenstates .",
    "we conclude that different types of deviations appear in the spectrum when the confinement potential is not perfectly parabolic . in order to analyze these deviations in more detail ,",

    "[ fircomb ] . as the non - interacting singlet spectra , in fig .",
    "[ firs0 ] ( d)-(f ) , are the same as the single - particle spectra , these would correspond to experimental fir spectra with one electron in the qdm .",
    "the non - interacting triplet , on the other hand , corresponds the fir spectra of two occupied single - particle levels .    the double dot singlet spectrum in fig .  [ firs0 ]",
    "( a ) looks qualitatively very similar to the noninteracting spectrum in fig .",
    "[ firs0 ] ( d ) .",
    "the first difference is that the kohn modes lie at the lower energy in the non - interacting spectra compared to the interacting spectra .",
    "the only exception is in the upper mode at @xmath64 where both have excitation energy of @xmath65 mev . in zero magnetic field",
    "this corresponds to linearly polarized excitation along @xmath20 axis where the potential is parabolic and therefore excitations are not affected by the electron - electron interactions  @xcite .",
    "another difference is the zero - field gap between kohn modes which is clearly greater in the non - interacting case .",
    "higher energy excitations in the interacting case can be explained with the coulomb repulsion between the electrons .",
    "coulomb repulsion effectively steepens the confinement resulting in higher excitation energies .",
    "the anticrossing points are also affected by interactions whereas the gap remains almost the same .",
    "the anticrossings can be seen at lower magnetic field values in the interacting spectrum .",
    "qualitatively the two spectra look very similar and we conclude that the deviations observed in the spectrum result from the low symmetry confinement and interactions only shift the excitation energies and change the anticrossing points .",
    "generally the same conclusions drawn for the double dot hold for the square - symmetric four - minima qdm singlet spectra in fig .  [ firs0 ] ( b ) and ( e ) . now in the square - symmetric four - minima qdm",
    "the zero field excitation is degenerate as the two perpendicular directions ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) have identical confinement profiles .",

    "[ firs0 ] ( c ) and ( f ) ) the confinement profile is non - identical and non - parabolic in both perpendicular directions",
    ". therefore both zero - field excitations are lower than @xmath68 mev and there is also a gap between the two modes .",
    "again excitation energies as a function of magnetic field are higher in the interacting spectrum and anticrossings are seen at the lower magnetic field values compared to the noninteracting spectrum .",
    "interesting point , when comparing interacting and noninteracting spectra , is that the zero - field excitation energy of the lower mode shifts to @xmath73 mev higher and the higher mode shifts only @xmath74 mev higher when the interactions are turned on .",
    "it means that the coulomb repulsion is over three times more significant in the excitation along the long axis ( @xmath20 axis ) than it is along the short axis ( @xmath19 axis ) .",
