    "within the last decade , the fly s eye @xcite and its successor hires @xcite , as well as the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) @xcite , have detected over 70 ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) with energies measured reliably to be in excess of @xmath1  the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) ` cutoff ' energy @xcite .",
    "the older air shower arrays at volcano ranch @xcite , haverah park @xcite , and yakutsk @xcite have added another 45 ( recalibrated ) post - gzk events . at energies above @xmath2 ,",
    "the typical range of protons falls rapidly because of interactions with cosmic microwave background photons @xcite , becoming as low as @xmath3  mpc at @xmath4 , the highest energy event observed by fly s eye ; the range is even smaller for heavy nuclei @xcite . for photons with energy above @xmath2 , the dominant opacity is due to scattering on the extragalactic radio background which is poorly known experimentally @xcite ; the mean free path is estimated to be @xmath5  mpc at @xmath6 @xcite .",

    "the expected value of @xmath8  g@xmath7 for a photon primary @xcite .",
    "the muon content of horizontal showers in the haverah park data implies an upper bound of 65% on the photon component , and a ( hadronic interaction model dependent ) upper bound of @xmath9 on the iron nuclei content , of post - gzk uhecrs @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasised however that a complete understanding of air shower development is still lacking , so the composition of uhecrs is not definitively established yet @xcite .",
    "] there is no restrictive constraint on the range if the uhecr primaries are neutral and weakly interacting , viz .",
    "neutrinos which have only a tiny probability for scattering on the relic cosmic neutrino background @xcite .",
    ", then uhe cosmic neutrinos can annihilate resonantly on these to generate ` z - bursts ' which create photons and nucleons above @xmath2 @xcite . to match the observed uhecr flux given experimental limits on the uhe cosmic neutrino flux @xcite requires however a substantial increase in the local density of relic neutrinos @xcite .",
    "] this also means however that neutrinos can not initiate the observed airshowers as their cross - section for deep inelastic scattering on nucleons is far too small @xcite .",
    "thus all the available evidence suggests that cosmic rays with energies @xmath10 are protons , in which case they must originate within the local supercluster .- gluino state ) with a higher gzk cutoff @xcite .",
    "the correlation has however been questioned @xcite ; moreover there are stringent experimental bounds on new stable strongly interacting particles @xcite . ]",
    "however they can not originate in the galactic disk since significant anisotropies would then be expected at post - gzk energies @xcite , while the observed sky distribution is consistent with isotropy @xcite .",
    "fly s eye @xcite and agasa @xcite have detected anisotropy towards the galactic plane , consistent with the usual belief that cosmic rays at these energies have a galactic origin . ] a number of doublet and triplet events , collimated within the experimental angular resolution of a few degrees , have been observed but the chance probability of these arising from an isotropic distribution is estimated to be of order 10% @xcite , hence statistically not significant . of the supergalactic plane are considered , the chance probability that they arise from an isotropic distribution is less than 1% @xcite . ]    there have been a plethora of suggestions as to the possible origin of uhecrs , which may be broadly classified into ` top - down ' or ` bottom - up ' models . in the former class ,",
    "the extreme energies are supposedly provided by the decay of relic topological defects ( td ) @xcite or super - massive particles @xcite . in the latter class ,",
    "the uhecrs are assumed to have been accelerated up from low energies in astrophysical sites such as gamma - ray bursts @xcite , active galaxies @xcite or super - massive black holes in dormant quasars @xcite .",
    "in fact there are severe difficulties with accelerating particles to the highest observed energies by _ any _ known astrophysical mechanism @xcite .",
    "moreover even if such sources are distributed nearby like the observed galaxies , the injection spectrum must be harder than @xmath11 in order to overcome the gzk energy losses and match the measured uhecr flux @xcite , so the energetic demands are considerable .",
    "gamma - ray bursters may possibly have the required energy but , being more abundant at high redshift , can not yield the locally observed uhecr flux @xcite .",
    "there are a few active galaxies within the ` gzk sphere ' but even if they can accelerate uhecr these would need to be deflected through rather large angles ( and isotropised ) by the intergalactic magnetic field @xcite ; this requires the field strength to be @xmath12 times stronger than the upper limit of order nanogauss usually inferred from observational bounds on faraday rotation in distant radio sources @xcite .",
    "there is ongoing discussion concerning the possibility of such high fields @xcite , as well as of specific sources such as cen a @xcite and virgo a @xcite .",
    "although there is no compelling astrophysical model for post - gzk uhecrs , some of these suggestions are interesting in their own right and can be tested with forthcoming data .    in this paper , we investigate the spectral signature of ` top - down ' models .",
    "relic topological defects will in general be cosmologically distant and release particles at the gut - scale , resulting in a typically excessive flux of secondary low energy @xmath13-rays as the primaries interact with intergalactic radiation fields @xcite .",
    "so we favour the possibility that uhecrs originate from the decay of super - massive relic particles which , being cold dark matter ( cdm ) , are _ locally _ clustered in the halo of our galaxy , thus naturally evading the gzk - cutoff and also presenting an approximately isotropic distribution @xcite .",
    "such particles must have a mass @xmath14 to account for the highest energy event , and a lifetime exceeding the age of the universe .",
    "a physically well - motivated candidate with both the required mass and lifetime is the `` crypton ''  the analogue of a hadron in the hidden sector of supersymmetry breaking in string theories @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that such particles can readily be produced with a cosmologically interesting abundance through the time - varying gravitational field at the end of inflation @xcite , or possibly , during ( re)heating after inflation @xcite .",
    "a key test of this model is the expected small anisotropy due to the offset of the sun from the centre of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "some authors have argued @xcite that present limits on the anisotropy already place severe constraints on the model ; however a recent detailed analysis of the expected anisotropy signal @xcite of post - gzk uhecrs shows it to be both compatible with all present data and moreover capable of being definitively detected by the pierre auger project which is presently under construction @xcite , and by the proposed extreme universe space observatory @xcite .",
    "these experiments will provide a very substantial increase in the presently meagre statistics of post - gzk uhecrs and also be able to distinguish between incident photon , neutrino and nucleon primaries .",
    "this is clearly an opportune time to make predictions of the expected spectrum and composition of uhecrs in the decaying dark matter ( ddm ) model .",
    "the essential idea @xcite here is that because of gravitational clustering , very massive relic particles would naturally have a density in the halo of our galaxy which is enhanced by a factor of @xmath15 over the cosmic average .",
    "this is approximately the same factor by which the distance to the horizon exceeds the halo radius , so if these particles decay to produce uhecrs the flux from cosmologically distant regions will be at best comparable to the flux from our halo even if there is _ no _ absorption @xcite . given the gzk attenuation , the extragalactic flux of protons and photons in this model would be quite negligible compared to the flux from the galactic halo , whereas for neutrinos there would be an extragalactic component comparable to the galactic one @xcite .",
    "the injection spectrum produced by the decay of a population of superheavy dark matter particles @xmath16 , with number density @xmath17 , is proportional to the inclusive decay width of @xmath16 : @xmath18 where we have taken the lifetime of @xmath16 to be longer than the age of the universe , @xmath19  yr . photons produced in the galactic halo can interact with the galactic low frequency radio background on their way to the earth ; the number of high energy photons reaching the earth may then be significantly reduced .",
    "however the radio background is presently very poorly known @xcite so we do not include photon processing in the halo in this work .",
    "we consider a spherical halo of radius @xmath20 and uniform density @xmath21 ( see ref.@xcite for a thorough study of uhecr and halo models ) . the galactic halo contribution to the uhecr spectrum",
    "is then given by @xmath22    in order to calculate the inclusive decay width , some assumptions have to be made about the microphysics of @xmath16 decay .",
    "it is usually assumed in top - down models ( i.e. for both td and ddm ) that the initial decay is into a parton - antiparton pair .",
    "any angular dependence of the decay amplitude is immaterial since the flux at earth is close to isotropic .",
    "therefore in the following section ( [ ffevolution ] ) we shall consider decays into quarks and gluons ( and also their superpartners when allowing for the presence of supersymmetry ) .",
    "for a particle @xmath16 with mass @xmath23 , decaying into partons which hadronise into particles of type @xmath24 ( carrying a fraction @xmath25 of the maximum available momentum @xmath26 , and a fraction @xmath27 of the parton momentum ) , the inclusive decay width can be factorised as @xcite @xmath28 the first factor , the decay width of @xmath16 into parton @xmath29 , @xmath30 , is calculable in perturbation theory ; in lowest order and for 2-body decay it is proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "the second factor , the non - perturbative @xmath32 , is the fragmentation function ( ff ) for particles of type @xmath24 from partons of type @xmath29 .",
    "both factors depend on the factorisation scale @xmath33 .",
    "the dependence on @xmath33 of the physical inclusive decay width would cancel out if the calculation could be carried out to all orders in perturbation theory but in a finite - order calculation some dependence on @xmath33 remains to orders higher than those calculated .",
    "the choice @xmath34 is the most appropriate @xcite .",
    "every perturbative term in the above factorisation depends also on an arbitrary renormalization scale ; following the usual convention , we take the renormalization scale to equal the factorisation scale .",
    "the cancellation of the dependence on @xmath33 between the perturbative factors and the ffs constrains the latter to satisfy the dokshitzer ",

    "parisi ( dglap ) equations @xcite . given experimental data on hadronisation at some low energy scale ,",
    "say @xmath35 , an initial set of fragmentation functions @xmath36 can be extracted .",
    "these can then be evolved using the dglap equations to obtain the ffs at some higher scale @xmath37 .",
    "this evolution gives rise to scaling violations in the @xmath25dependence of the inclusive decay width of @xmath16 in exactly the same way that scale - dependence of structure functions and ffs produce scaling violations in experimentally measured hadronic cross - sections @xcite .",
    "the dglap equations can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the strong coupling constant and @xmath40 is the splitting function for the parton branching @xmath41 . here",

    "we calculate @xmath157 , the probability density that one parton carries off a fraction @xmath27 of the total available energy per parton @xmath26 . for @xmath158",
    "we get @xmath159 to leading order in @xmath46 the particle flux is then given by @xmath160 in particular if @xmath161 as @xmath105 , the differential particle flux decreases as @xmath162 .",
    "for many - body @xmath16 decays the total flux is @xmath163 where @xmath118 is the number of partons into which @xmath16 decays . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nbody ] we plot susy spectra with @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "as @xmath118 increases the spectrum flattens since the average momentum is pushed to lower values of @xmath25 ( see appendix  [ multibody ] ) .",
    "for @xmath166 we get @xmath167 respectively .",
    "clearly many - body decays fit the data better which is encouraging as this would be natural in the crypton model @xcite . with the forthcoming improvement in event statistics a joint fit to the",
    "decaying particle mass and decay multiplicity would be warranted .",
    "we now compare these results to our previous work in which the fragmentation spectra were found by directly running herwig at the decaying particle mass scale @xcite , as well as to other work where numerical solutions to the dglap evolution were also reported @xcite , and , finally , to a recently proposed independent method for calculating the fragmentation spectrum @xcite .",
    "first it should be emphasised that most studies of ` top - down ' models have employed the mlla approximation to the fragmentation functions @xcite which , as noted earlier , is valid only at @xmath168 where a very small ( and uncertain ) amount of energy is released , and is thus _ incapable _ of being normalised as was done in these papers .",
    "other studies @xcite have used a convenient ( and properly normalised ) parameterisation of the fragmentation function based on petra data at @xmath169 @xcite which , however , does not account for the large scaling violations in evolving up to the very high energies of interest here .",
    "moreover in both these approaches it was _ assumed _ that the ratio of pions to baryons in the cascade remains fixed at its low energy value of 20:1 at all energies .",
    "( in reality one would expect the ff of say neutrinos to evolve differently from that of baryons due to new processes at high energies e.g. decays of heavy flavours . ) all these studies focussed on a decaying particle mass of @xmath170 , close to the gut scale .",
    "these difficulties were emphasised in our previous work @xcite where herwig was used to make the first realistic estimate of the fragmentation function for super - massive particle decay , including the expected large scaling violations .",
    "it was shown that the uhecr data favoured a decaying particle mass of @xmath171  close to the ` hidden sector ' scale of susy breaking rather than to the gut scale .",
    "however this work suffered itself from the fact that herwig overproduces baryons by a factor of @xmath172 at high @xmath25 ( see fig .  [ fig : lep_p ] ) ; moreover it did not account for the effects of supersymmetry on the development of the cascade .",
    "both these issues were addressed in ref.@xcite which suggested that the way forward was to evolve measured fragmentation functions at lep up to the decaying particle mass . for the susy case ,",
    "sparton ffs were generated at @xmath173 using the event generator pythia @xcite and the evolution done for a supergravity model with parameters @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 , sgn(@xmath33)=+ .",
    "apart from highlighting the high-@xmath25 baryon overproduction problem in the previous work @xcite for the sm case , this work showed that the effects of supersymmetry could be important in that the most likely decaying particle mass increased from @xmath178 for the sm to @xmath179 for susy @xcite .",
    "subsequently the dglap equations were also solved in ref.@xcite following a similar procedure but these authors favoured the possibility that the decaying particles are uniformly distributed in intergalactic space rather than being clustered in the halo .",
    "then the decay spectrum undergoes gzk processing , developing a ` bump ' below the putative cutoff ; by fitting this to the ( unnormalised ) data from agasa , fly s eye and haverah park they found an even higher decaying particle mass of @xmath180 @xcite .",
    "( for the physically better motivated case of a clustered halo population , their best - fit mass is @xmath154 in agreement with previous work @xcite , but since the ffs for this mass were not presented , we can not compare their results with ours in detail here . ) finally in ref.@xcite a new monte carlo simulation for jet fragmentation was presented and used to calculate the susy ffs for a @xmath154 mass particle ; however the sm ffs were not presented .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_sm ] we compare the ( flavour - averaged ) ffs of baryons , photons and neutrinos for a @xmath154 mass decaying particle obtained from herwig @xcite , with the results from ( sm ) dglap evolution in ref.@xcite , as well as in the present study .",
    "the baryon overproduction problem at high @xmath25 is evident in the herwig results ; in fact photons and neutrinos now dominate at _ all _ energies .",
    "secondly the results obtained by dglap evolution agree reasonably well , keeping in mind that ref.@xcite incorporated gluon coherence @xcite and also next - to - leading order corrections for both @xmath46 evolution and the splitting functions , which we have not done in the present work .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_susy ] we compare the ( flavour - averaged ) ffs for baryons , photons and neutrinos obtained from ( susy ) dglap evolution in ref.@xcite and in present work , with the results from the new fragmentation code of ref.@xcite .",
    "there are significant differences between the results .",
    "note that we have taken sparton ffs to be _",
    "zero _ at threshold rather than generating them with pythia above threshold as was done in ref.@xcite ; this is presumably the major reason for the difference in our results and reflects the present degree of theoretical uncertainty in this approach .",
    "the results obtained by the new monte carlo simulation for jet fragmentation @xcite differ significantly from both dglap evolution calculations .",
    "since the sm ffs were not presented in this work we can not check whether the new code @xcite can reproduce the ( consistent ) results for sm dglap evolution discussed above . in view of these discrepancies ,",
    "further work is clearly necessary to calculate the spectrum reliably in the supersymmetric case .    in summary",
    "we have developed a new numerical code to solve the dglap evolution equations for fragmentation functions in heavy particle decay .",
    "we have used this to calculate the expected spectra of baryons , photons and neutrinos from the decays of hypothetical metastable dark matter particles of mass @xmath154 clustered in the halo of our galaxy , both for the case of standard model evolution and for a simple supersymmetric model .",
    "the shape of the fragmentation spectrum ( of either baryons or photons ) fits rather well the new component of ultra - high energy cosmic rays extending beyond the gzk energy ; the fit improves if the effects of supersymmetry and , more importantly , of many - body decays are taken into account .",
    "it is sometimes stated that the decaying particle model is already in conflict with observations because the dominant particles in the fragmentation cascades are predicted to be photons rather than baryons which are favoured by experiment @xcite .",
    "however as mentioned earlier the photons may be significantly attenuated in their passage to earth due to interactions on the radio background in the halo , particularly if there is a fossil radio ` ghost ' around our galaxy @xcite .",
    "whether this is indeed possible , subject to the egret bound on the low energy @xmath13-rays which will be created by such electromagnetic cascades , will be discussed by us elsewhere . also of interest",
    "is the expected flux of high energy neutrinos which can be detected in forthcoming experiments such as antares @xcite and icecube @xcite .",
    "most importantly the pierre auger observatory @xcite will significantly increase the statistics of uhecrs enabling a better measurement of the spectrum , as well as of the composition and ( an)isotropy .",
    "it will soon be possible to definitively test the exciting possibility that cosmic rays have already shown us a glimpse of physics far beyond the standard model .",
    "we are grateful to peter richardson and mike seymour for assistance in the use of herwig and john ellis , neil rubin , alan watson and bryan webber for many discussions .",
    "we would also like to thank zoltan fodor , michael kachelrie , sandor katz and motohiko nagano for helpful correspondence .",

    "we briefly review how to calculate the phase space @xmath181 for the decay of @xmath16 into @xmath118 partons ( see ref.@xcite for further details ) ; this is needed to calculate the probability density of obtaining a decay parton with energy @xmath182 .    from a kinematical point of view",
    "the decay @xmath183 can be decomposed recursively as a 2-body decay @xmath184 where @xmath185 is a particle with 4-momentum equal to the sum of 4-momenta of particles @xmath186 .",
    "then @xmath185 is decayed into two particles @xmath187 where @xmath188 has as 4-momentum the sum of the 4-momenta of @xmath189 , and so on up to the decay @xmath190 .",
    "this recursive procedure allows the phase space integral @xmath191 , @xmath192 , to be written as @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the invariant mass of @xmath195 and @xmath196 is the phase space integral for the 2-body decay @xmath197 : @xmath198 we shall study massless partons for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : ndecay ] ) reduces to @xmath199 let @xmath157 be the probability density to get parton @xmath200 with an energy fraction @xmath201 ( @xmath26 is the maximum energy that a parton can carry , whatever @xmath118 is ) . by symmetry",
    "this probability is independent of the parton considered .",
    "let us choose parton @xmath202 . then @xmath203 and @xmath204 the multiple integration can easily be done to obtain @xmath205 after normalisation we finally obtain : @xmath206 we plot this distribution in fig .  [",
    "fig : rho ] . as",
    "the number of final particles @xmath118 increases , the total energy @xmath23 has to be shared between more particles and consequently less energy goes to each one of them .",

    "<S> it has been speculated that the recently detected ultra - high energy cosmic rays may originate from the decays of relic particles with mass of order @xmath0 gev clustered in the halo of our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this hypothesis can be tested through forthcoming measurements of the spectra of both high energy cosmic nucleons and neutrinos , which are determined in this model by the physics of qcd fragmentation , with no astrophysical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we evolve fragmentation spectra measured at lep energies up to the scale of the decaying particle mass by numerical solution of the dglap equations . </S>",
    "<S> this enables incorporation of the effects of supersymmetry on the development of the cascade and we also allow for decays into many - particle states . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated spectral shape agrees well with present cosmic ray data beyond the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin energy . </S>"
