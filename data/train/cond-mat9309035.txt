    "from the work of abrahams , anderson , licciardello , and ramakrishnan  @xcite it is known that no true metallic behavior can be observed for non - interacting electrons at @xmath3 in two dimensions , since all states will be localized by arbitrarily weak disorder . when repulsive interactions are turned on",
    "the situation is less clear but the general belief @xcite is that a metallic phase still should be absent at @xmath3 in the presence of disorder , although we know of no rigorous proof of this .",
    "however , in the presence of attractive interactions , a superconducting phase is expected  @xcite , both at @xmath3 and finite @xmath4 , even for a finite amount of disorder , because disorder is irrelevant  @xcite at the finite temperature transition , which is of the kosterlitz - thouless  @xcite type discussed below .",
    "the onset of superconductivity at @xmath5 is presumed then , in @xmath6 , to be directly from the insulating phase with no intervening metallic phase .",
    "one should therefore in principle be able to observe a direct insulator - superconductor transition at zero temperature in two dimensions as a function of disorder and/or interaction strength .",
    "the main topic of this paper is to analyze such a transition and extract its universal features .",
    "dimensionality and divergent length scales play an important role in continuous phase transitions .",
    "the diverging correlation length scale implies that many microscopic details are irrelevant .",
    "furthermore physical quantities containing dimensions of length to some non - zero power typically diverge or vanish at the critical point .",
    "two dimensions is special in that the conductivity contains no length scale units , i.e.  the conductance per square is the same as the conductivity .",
    "hence , right at the @xmath3 quantum critical point , the conductivity is not only finite and nonzero but also _",
    "universal_@xcite , even though it is zero in the insulating phase and infinite in the superconducting phase .",
    "this view differs from that of previous work  @xcite which parameterized the transition in terms of the _ normal _ state resistivity .",
    "the calculation of this universal conductivity is one of the main goals of the present paper .",
    "a short account on some of our results has already been published  @xcite .    a schematic phase diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scphase ] as a function of temperature , @xmath4 , and disorder , @xmath7 . at zero temperature , a critical amount of disorder , @xmath8 , separates the superconducting from the insulating phase .",
    "even at finite temperatures the superconducting phase persists whereas a truly insulating phase only exists at @xmath3 , because , at finite @xmath4 , electrons can be _ inelastically _ scattered from one localized state to another , and hence conduct .",
    "this insulating phase , consisting of localized electron pairs , can then be described , close to the critical point , as a bose - condensed fluid of vortices .",
    "the universality class of the transition should therefore be that of the superconductor to bose glass  @xcite .",
    "let us first discuss the nature of the transition at finite temperatures indicated by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : scphase ] .",
    "the finite temperature transition should have many similarities with the 2d xy transition at which logarithmically interacting vortices unbind  @xcite .",
    "however , pearl  @xcite showed that in a superconducting film vortex pairs only have logarithmic interactions out to a distance @xmath9 beyond which the interaction energy falls off as @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 is the bulk penetration depth , @xmath12 the film thickness , and @xmath13 the screening length for magnetic fields . due to this cutoff",
    ", the energy required to create a vortex is always _ finite _ and no sharp transition should exist .",
    "however , according to the kosterlitz - thouless theory  @xcite , the value of @xmath14 is given _ exactly _ by @xcite @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the flux quantum .",
    "numerically @xmath17 where @xmath18 is in kelvin and @xmath14 is in _",
    "centimeters_. thus , @xmath13 is so large at @xmath18 that rounding of the transition due to the presence of free vortices below @xmath18 is almost certainly unobservable .",
    "in fact , rounding due to finite - size effects is probably more important .",
    "the vortex unbinding transition at @xmath18 is driven by fluctuations in the phase of the superconducting order parameter . at a higher temperature , @xmath19 , fluctuations in the amplitude of the order parameter",
    "will become important and a crossover to a regime dominated by paraconductivity  @xcite will occur .",
    "@xmath19 is indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : scphase ] . for @xmath20",
    "the presence of free vortices destroys the characteristic global properties of the superconducting phase .",
    "nevertheless , a _",
    "local _ order parameter still exists between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the presence of free vortices leads to a finite conductivity of the form  @xcite @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the conductivity of the normal state electrons , @xmath23 the core size of a vortex and @xmath24 , a typical distance between free vortices , is the kosterlitz - thouless  @xcite correlation length which diverges exponentially at @xmath18 .",
    "the exponential tail in the resistivity caused by the presence of free vortices between @xmath18 and @xmath19 has been observed experimentally  @xcite in superconducting films with high normal state resistivity . in these experiments",
    "the `` mean field onset temperature '' , @xmath19 is determined by fitting the resistance to an aslamazov - larkin  @xcite form , and @xmath25 is found to be of the order of half a kelvin . in the dirty limit , beasley et al .",
    "@xcite derive the relationship @xmath26",
    "so , for films with a relatively high sheet resistance , @xmath27 can be appreciable .",
    "for a review of the finite temperature transition we refer the reader to refs .  .",
    "more recently some evidence for a vortex - antivortex unbinding transition in superconducting niobium films  @xcite with @xmath28 has been found . however , the difference between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is very small in the clean limit which makes the kosterlitz - thouless behavior difficult to observe .",
    "the superconducting order parameter is a complex scalar , described by both a magnitude and a phase .",
    "our key basic assumption is that universal properties at superconductor - insulator transition are determined only by phase fluctuations , as outlined above , and that the magnitude of the order parameter , and therefore of the gap in the fermionic energy spectrum , remains finite at the critical point .",
    "we thus assume that when disorder drives @xmath18 to zero , @xmath19 remains nonzero .",
    "if the transition is approached from the insulating side , a local order parameter appears before the onset of global phase coherence at @xmath8 .",
    "implicit in our assumption is that cooper pairs , and thus a gap to fermionic excitations , persists into the insulating phase , even though superconductivity is destroyed by phase fluctuations . on the scale of a diverging _ phase_-correlation length , @xmath24",
    ", the individual cooper pairs will look like point particles .",
    "the fermionic degrees of freedom should therefore be highly suppressed at the critical point and an approximate description in terms of point - like bosons should be valid .",
    "it is possible that strong disorder destroys the local fermionic gap at a finite density of points , but , provided that the fermi degrees of freedom are localized , they may still be dynamically irrelevant and our model applicable .",
    "since we shall be concerned with the transition at @xmath29 , vortices in the system will not be excited thermally , but there will be vortices present created by quantum fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "we therefore need to treat the vortices as quantum mechanical objects and one might expect the transition at @xmath8 to be described by a ( 2 + 1)d xy model  @xcite , where the extra dimension arises because we are considering a t=0 quantum phase transition , see e.g.  ref .  .",
    "however as we shall see in section  [ sec : boshub ] , although the physics is indeed described by a ( 2 + 1)d system , its symmetry is , in general , _ not _ that of the xy model .",
    "it is also worth noting that the vortex mobility , @xmath30  @xcite , is significantly augmented in dirty superconducting films .",
    "hence , at @xmath8 the vortices should be seen as fairly light objects that move rather freely . at still higher disorder",
    "the bose glass phase should cross over into an fermi glass when the individual electrons constituting the bosons become localized .",
    "this behavior may have already been observed in a magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments seem to confirm that a direct insulator - superconductor transition indeed does take place at zero temperature in many materials .",
    "haviland et al .",
    "@xcite and liu et al .",
    "@xcite have performed experiments on bi films grown in situ .",
    "the experimental technique is described in ref .  .",
    "these films are believed to be truly amorphous on an atomic scale .",
    "the authors report a critical d.c .",
    "resistivity , @xmath31 , very close to @xmath32 , where @xmath33 furthermore , experiments performed on dybacuo films  @xcite and ndcecuo  @xcite show clear evidence for a direct superconductor - insulator transition .",
    "the reported critical resistivity seems in this case to be somewhat higher , around 10 k@xmath34 or 1.5 @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "lee and ketterson  @xcite have presented results from experiments on moc films again showing very clear evidence for a superconductor - insulator transition occurring at zero temperature , but with @xmath31 slightly lower , in the range 2.8 - 3.5 k@xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , experiments performed on josephson junction arrays  @xcite , which are believed to be in the same universality class , also seem to support the picture of a superconductor - insulator transition .",
    "the existence of a superconductor - insulator transition in two - dimensional films at zero temperature thus seems well established but evidence for the universality of the critical resistivity remains weak .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether all the experiments are in the critical region . in order to establish that a given experiment is actually probing the critical regime , one must show scaling of the resistivity data",
    "this has been done successfully by hebard and paalanen  @xcite for the field - tuned transition and partially successfully by the minnesota group  @xcite .",
    "however it is likely that most measurements to date have failed to probe the critical regime , and further experiments at even lower temperatures are expected to give better agreement among the different estimates of @xmath31 .",
    "the situation concerning the relevance of a bosonic picture seems less clear .",
    "hebard and paalanen  @xcite have reported results on amorphous ino films in a magnetic field , supporting the existence of cooper pairs in the insulating phase . for the @xmath36 transition ,",
    "hebard and paalanen  @xcite have presented clear transport evidence that @xmath19 remains finite as @xmath18 is driven to zero . on the other hand , direct tunneling measurements by dynes et al .",
    "@xcite and valles et al .",
    "@xcite on homogeneously disordered pb films shows that the gap goes to zero at the critical point",
    ". there seems , however , to be a general agreement that a local superconducting order parameter exists prior to the transition in granular films and in josephson junction arrays where the individual grains become superconducting above @xmath18 .",
    "it is possible that tunneling experiments tend to emphasize regions of the samples containing quasilocalized fermion states below the gap which are necessary to achieve tunneling .",
    "a number of theoretical and numerical studies of the superconductor - insulator transition have been performed .",
    "gold  @xcite studied the impurity induced insulating transition in the interacting bose gas .",
    "giamarchi and schulz  @xcite considered the one - dimensional electron gas with attractive interactions in the presence of disorder .",
    "they found a transition to a localized phase in the same universality class as that of repulsively interacting bosons in a random potential .",
    "this lends strong support to our assumption of the dirty boson universality class in the 2d case .",
    "fisher et al .",
    "@xcite considered the boson hubbard model and , through a scaling analysis , derived equations for the exponents governing the superconductor - insulator transition as well as the phase diagram for dirty bosons .",
    "a renormalization group approach was taken by weichman et al .",

    "@xcite and krauth et al .",
    "@xcite , showed , by quantum monte carlo simulations , the existence of mott insulating phases in an interacting boson system without disorder , characterized by the exponents predicted by fisher et al .",
    "@xcite subsequently , these authors considered the disordered case and evidence for a bose glass was found.@xcite a bose glass phase was also observed in a real space renormalization group study by singh et al .",
    "@xcite the universal conductivity was first calculated by a @xmath37 expansion and monte carlo methods for the ( 2 + 1)d xy model by cha et al .",
    "@xcite and girvin et al .",
    "@xcite the universal conductivity for disordered bosons was then calculated by runge  @xcite by exact diagonalization techniques on small lattices .",
    "universal properties for a boson system in the presence of disorder both with and without long - range interactions were calculated by srensen et al .",
    "@xcite by monte carlo simulations , using a path integral representation which , effectively , only includes phase fluctuations in the bose field .",
    "a universal conductivity was also recently found by kampf et al .",
    "@xcite in the boson hubbard model including both phase and amplitude fluctuations .",
    "two recent works have recently been published after the present work was finished .",
    "batrouni et al .",
    "@xcite have calculated the universal conductivity by quantum monte carlo simulations directly on the boson hubbard model , and makivi et al .",
    "@xcite have calculated the exponents and the universal conductivity using a hard - core boson model .",
    "the results of these last two papers differ from ours , and we shall comment on this in section [ discuss ] .    here",
    "we shall consider two forms of interaction between the bosons : short - range repulsive interaction and long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "the model with short - range interactions is relevant to experiments on the onset of superfluidity in @xmath38he films  @xcite .",
    "however , our present results for the zero temperature transition in 2d are not directly applicable to he experiments in porous media such as vycor or xerogel  @xcite , since these experiments are mainly concerned with the 3d transition at finite temperatures . as stated above , the model with coulomb interactions is expected to be in the correct universality class to describe the superconductor - insulator transition . however , the model and many of the results presented in this paper are applicable to other systems too .",
    "the world lines of the dirty boson model describe a gas of stringlike objects in a random medium .",
    "in addition to the superconductor - insulator transition this model may also apply to other problems such as vortex lines in high - temperature superconductors with correlated pinning centers  @xcite , and polymer solutions . our results for _ universal _ quantities might also be relevant for these problems .",

    "we shall construct a form of the boson hubbard model , including disorder and interactions , which is suitable for monte carlo simulations . here",
    "we shall assume , as discussed above , that only bosonic degrees of freedom , i.e.  complex order parameter fluctuations , are relevant at the superconductor - insulator transition .",

    "in this section we introduce our basic model and via a sequence of transformations arrive at a form suitable for monte carlo simulation .",
    "as argued above it should be possible to describe the universal features of the superconductor - insulator transition in terms of boson physics . in this section",
    "we shall argue that the relevant starting point is the boson hubbard model with a random local chemical potential ( site energy ) .",
    "if only phase fluctuations are relevant we can map this model onto a dual villain type model .",
    "we shall see that only in the absence of disorder and when there is an integer number of bosons per site , does this model belong to the same universality class as the ( 2 + 1)d xy model .    in order to model the superconductor - insulator transition in terms of bosons",
    ", we must include an on - site repulsive interaction , otherwise all bosons would collapse into the lowest lying , highly localized state .",

    ", it would be very interesting to study the field - tuned transition  @xcite by monte carlo simulations , since this is expected to be in a different universality class  @xcite from the disorder - tuned transition discussed here .",
    "the problem is that one needs to find a representation of the problem in terms of a _ real _ classical ( d+1 ) dimensional effective hamiltonian which incorporates both the magnetic field and lack of microscopic particle - hole symmetry .",
    "unfortunately , the phase representation , eq .  ( [ eq : isotropic ] ) , though it can be generalized to include a field and is still real for the particle - hole symmetric case , is complex in the absence of particle - hole symmetry , and the link representation used here becomes complex in the presence of a field , as can be seen from eq .",

    "as we shall discuss extensively in this paper , the long - distance properties of superconductivity can , at least to some extent , be described in terms of ( repulsively interacting ) bosons .",
    "it thus appears that fermions with repulsive interactions are always localized ( i.e.  insulating at @xmath3 ) in @xmath6 , whereas bosons can ( super)conduct if the disorder is not too strong .",

    "while it is clear that the universality class will not change if the anisotropy among the different lattice directions is finite , one might possibly worry that crossover to some new behavior could occur in the limit when the anisotropy tends to infinity , as happens here .",
    "however , there is at least one model , the 1-dimensional ( quantum ) ising model in a transverse field , which can be mapped on to the classical ( 1 + 1 ) dimensional classical ising model in the limit of infinite anisotropy , and which can be solved exactly .",
