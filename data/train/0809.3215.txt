    "the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) is nowadays considered to be an effective theory valid only up to a certain physical cutoff scale . even though there exist a large variety of extensions of the sm , models with a hidden sector",
    "have recently attracted some attention .",
    "we will consider models with additional scalar fields that might transform non - trivially under a hidden gauge group but which are singlets under the sm gauge group .",
    "the only renormalizable interaction of such scalars with the sm occurs via the higgs sector , which in this case serves as a portal to the hidden sector  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are concerned with some of the possible cosmological implications of hidden sector extensions of the sm .",
    "this is a continuation of the study of the electroweak breaking and phase transition presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and we will provide some technical details that were omitted there .",
    "in addition we will present an analysis of other cosmological implications , namely gravitational wave production and dark matter abundance",
    ". we also comment on the possibility of low - scale inflation and present a calculation of the bubble wall velocity in case of a first - order electroweak phase transition . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we pay special attention to the classically conformal case which , for a strong coupling between the hidden sector scalars and the higgs field , can be consistent with the mass bounds on the higgs particle .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_model ] ,",
    "the model is presented , both at zero and finite temperature . in section  [ sec_pheno ]",
    "the cosmological implications of the model mentioned above are discussed and we conclude in section  [ sec_concl ] .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath0 real scalar fields @xmath1 coupled to the sm higgs doublet @xmath2 with the tree level potential [ eq_v0 ] v_0 = m^2 h^h + ( h^h ) ^2 + _ i ( 12 m^2_s_i + ^2_i h^h ) s_i^2  .",
    "we assume there are no linear or cubic terms in the hidden - sector scalar fields [ this can be enforced by some global symmetry , e.g. @xmath3 . besides , we assume that the squared masses of the hidden scalars are semi - positive definite ( @xmath4 ) , such that this global symmetry remains unbroken and no quartic terms are necessary to stabilize the potential .    in the presence of a background higgs field , @xmath5 , the one - loop effective potential in landau gauge and @xmath6 scheme",
    "is then given by [ eq_v1_ms ] v_1-loop = v_0 + v_1-loop = 2 ^2 + 4 ^4 + _  .",
    "the subscript @xmath7 denotes the gauge bosons ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , top quark , higgs boson , goldstone bosons ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and hidden - sector scalar fields with @xmath12 while @xmath13 for gauge bosons and @xmath14 for fermions and scalars .",
    "the @xmath15-dependent tree level masses are & m^2_s_i ( ) = m^2_s_i+^2_i ^2  , m^2_z()= ( g^2 + g^2 ) ^2  , m^2_w()= g^2 ^2  , & + & m^2_t()= y_t^2 ^2  , m^2_h ( ) = 3 ^2 + m^2  , m^2_g()= ^2 + m^2  , & where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the sm gauge couplings and @xmath18 the top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "as it was mentioned in the introduction the case with classical conformal invariance ( i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) is especially interesting . in this situation",
    "all masses are proportional to the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and no dimensionful parameters enter into the tree level potential .",
    "however conformal invariance is broken by loop corrections as can be seen in  ( [ eq_v1_ms ] ) by the occurrence of the renormalization scale @xmath21 . in this way a mass scale is introduced via dimensional transmutation  @xcite .",
    "notice that an important difference with respect to the pure @xmath22-theory is that , in the interesting region of the parameter space , the loop contributions are dominated by the hidden - sector scalar ( and top ) particles .",
    "hence , it is not mandatory to improve the one - loop potential by renormalization group techniques ( unlike in the @xmath22-theory ) and moreover the goldstone and higgs one - loop contributions to the potential can be safely neglected  @xcite . in the classically conformal case the correct vev follows from the minimization condition = - _  , where @xmath23 gev is the observed higgs vev of the sm and @xmath21",
    "should be chosen near @xmath24 .",
    "the potential then reads as [ eq_v1_conf ] v^conf_1-loop = ^4  , where @xmath25 is the one - loop higgs mass given by [ eq_mhiggs_conformal ] m_h^2 = . v    hidden - sector scalars ,",
    "rather strongly coupled to the higgs field , can lead to a higgs mass above the lep bound , even if the theory is classically conformal invariant  .",
    "similarly the goldstone boson is massless at one - loop unlike the tree level result @xmath26 .",
    "this discrepancy between the tree - level and one - loop masses does also appear in the non - conformal case .",
    "it usually does not constitute a significant complication , since the loop contributions of the higgs and goldstone bosons are small . ] .",
    "given the fact that the dramatic impact on electroweak symmetry breaking we find is due to a sizable number of scalars somewhat strongly coupled to the higgs , one might worry about the stability of the results when higher - order corrections to the potential are included .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the dominant two - loop radiative corrections to the higgs potential ( those that depend on the top yukawa coupling @xmath18 and @xmath27 ) by using standard techniques , as e.g.  those used in ref .",
    "we have found that these two - loop effects never modify the structure of the potential in a qualitative way .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the influence of the hidden - sector scalars on the cubic higgs self - coupling . in",
    "@xcite the claim was made that a strong phase transition often would lead to a deviation of the cubic higgs coupling from its sm value .",
    "taking only into account the top and hidden - sector scalar contributions , one obtains [ eq_cubic_dev ] -1 =  , which will be correlated with the strength of the phase transition in a later section .      in order to study the electroweak phase transition of the model",
    ", we consider the one - loop potential at finite temperature including the resummed daisy - diagrams .",
    "the corresponding contributions are given by [ eq_pot_thermal ] v_t & = & _ n_dx x^2 + & & + _ n _ \\ { m^3_-[m^2_+ _ ( t)]^3/2 }  , where the @xmath28 holds for fermions ( bosons ) and @xmath29 are the thermal masses of the different bosonic species . neglecting small @xmath30 contributions they read _",

    "in this section we discuss cosmological implications of the hidden - sector scalar extensions of the sm .",
    "namely , the electroweak phase transition , low - scale inflation , the bubble wall velocity during a first - order phase transition , gravitational wave production and dark matter are analyzed .      in order to study the electroweak phase transition",
    ", we determine the so - called bounce solution of the three - dimensional euclidean action that quantifies the tunneling probability in case of a first - order phase transition  @xcite .    at finite temperature",
    "the bounce solution is obtained by extremizing the action s_3 = 4_0^d  ^2  , ( where @xmath31 is the radial distance from the center of the bubble ) with solutions obeying the boundary conditions _ ( 0 ) = 0 , _ ( ) = 0  .",
    "in addition it is understood that the bounce solution @xmath15 starts ( at @xmath32 ) close to the global minimum of the potential ( the broken phase of the higgs vacuum ) .",
    "the tunneling rate per unit volume and time element is approximately given by @xcite [ eq_rate_3d ] _",
    "3 t^4  , with @xmath33^{3/2}$ ] , such that the average number of bubble nucleations per hubble volume is given by [ eq_p_def ] p(t ) = ^t_c_t _ 3  , where the hubble parameter is given by [ eq_def_hubble ] h^2  , @xmath34 is the effective number of degrees of freedom and @xmath35  gev is the planck mass .",
    "tunneling becomes in principle possible below the temperature @xmath36 at which the two minima of the potential are degenerate , but for almost degenerate vacua , the tunneling rate is still too small to start the phase transition .",
    "we define the temperature @xmath37 at which the phase transition starts by the average occurrence of one bubble per hubble volume [ eq_tn_def ] p(t_n ) = 1 .",
    "the first nucleation of bubbles will hence approximately take place when [ eq_140 ] 4 ( ) 142 - 4 ( ) .    in order to characterize the end of the phase transition the fraction of space that is covered by bubbles",
    "can be used . neglecting overlapping bubbles this",
    "is given by f ( t ) = ^t_c_t _ 3 r^3(t , t )  , where r(t , t ) = ( 1- )  . here",
    "@xmath38 is the velocity of the bubble wall and we define the end of the phase transition @xmath39 by f(t_f ) = 1  .",
    "+    in order to quantify the strength of the phase transition we determine several quantities .",
    "these are evaluated at the end of the phase transition , when most cosmological processes such as baryogenesis and gravitational wave production take place .",
    "the first quantity is the ratio between the higgs vev and the temperature , @xmath40 .",
    "this ratio is important for baryogenesis , since suppression of washout effects by sphalerons  @xcite requires @xmath41 in the standard model .",
    "we do not expect this bound to be much different in the present model , since the sphaleron energy is dominated by the contributions from the gauge field configurations excited in the sphaleron rather than the scalar ones  @xcite .",
    "the second quantity is the duration of the phase transition @xmath42 , which is given by = t ( )  .",
    "the last quantity we are interested in is the latent heat = t - v ( ) + v(0 )  .",
    "the latent heat is usually normalized to the energy density of the radiation in the plasma , through the dimensionless parameter @xmath43 [ eq_def_alpha ] = =  .",
    "the quantities @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as well as the bubble velocity @xmath45 , are the key parameters that govern gravitational wave production ( discussed in a later section ) .    for our numerical examples",
    "we take , as in  @xcite , a number of scalars @xmath46 with universal couplings to the higgs , @xmath47 , and no explicit mass terms , @xmath48 .",
    "the results for the electroweak phase transition parameters listed above , as functions of @xmath27 and for several values of the higgs mass @xmath25 ( consistent with electroweak breaking conditions ) , are plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig_ptab ] to [ fig_ptphiot ] . for small values of @xmath27 ,",
    "the phase transition is sm - like and therefore it is of second - order or a cross - over . as expected , the phase transition is in general stronger for larger values of @xmath27 and smaller higgs masses .",
    "the latent heat ( as described by @xmath43 ) and the strength of the transition [ as measured by @xmath49 are both quickly increasing with @xmath27 and larger for smaller @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_ptab ] ) . in the figures we mark the conformal case with a cross and we see that , even in this case , the model shows a first - order phase transition strong enough to allow for electroweak baryogenesis ( see fig .  [ fig_ptphiot ] ) . to the right of that conformal point",
    "the higgs potential of the model has a barrier separating the symmetric and broken phases even at @xmath50 . for too large values of @xmath27",
    "this barrier becomes too high and tunneling by thermal fluctuations is not efficient to trigger the electroweak phase transition .",
    "note how the time of the transition , @xmath42 , gets larger and larger with increasing @xmath27 .",
    "eventually no thermal transition will occur beyond a critical point @xmath51 and one would get stuck in the symmetric minimum ( see below ) .",
    "finally we point out that in the present model a strong first - order phase transition does not necessarily imply a very large deviation of the cubic higgs coupling from its sm value . independently of the value of the higgs mass ,",
    "a phase transition that is strong enough for the suppression of sphaleron processes , @xmath52 , is possible for deviations of the cubic coupling as small as @xmath53 , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_ptvcub ] .      every time a relatively strong first - order phase transition occurs during the evolution of the universe the plasma undergoes a stage of large over - cooling .",
    "this means that the energy finally released as latent heat is large compared to the thermal energy stored in the plasma . in this context",
    "it is worthwhile to ask whether during the stage of over - cooling the expansion of the universe is significantly accelerated due to the dominance of the vacuum energy , _ i.e. _ whether inflation occurs .",
    "this might be interesting in order to connect the predictions of inflation to low energy physics , but also for more exotic scenarios like cold electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite",
    ".    however if inflation takes place at electroweak scales the problem on whether this scenario allows for a graceful exit arises .",
    "it is well known that a realistic first - order phase transition can not proceed arbitrarily slow , since percolation requires the decay rate of the vacuum to become rather large at a certain temperature  @xcite .",
    "this severely constrains the prospects of low - scale inflation in such scenarios .",
    "we will now analyze the two possible scenarios .",
    "the first scenario is that inflation ends by thermal tunneling  @xcite . in this case",
    "a substantial amount of inflation is hardly achieved as can be seen as follows .",
    "suppose that nucleation takes place after @xmath54 e - folds of inflation . in this case",
    "the nucleation temperature , @xmath37 , will be very low compared to the temperature of degenerate vacua @xmath55 n_e =  .",
    "the higgs vev will have to remain stuck in the symmetric phase down to very small temperatures and the energy density will be dominated by the vacuum energy , @xmath56 , rather than by the thermal energy of the plasma . roughly speaking ,",
    "the vacuum energy is related to the temperature of degenerate vacua , such that the hubble parameter is h^2  . imposing that the thermal decay rate at @xmath37 is larger than the hubble rate we get the condition 4 ( ) 142 + 4 ( ) = 142 - 4 n_e 142  . in this regime of very small nucleation temperature",
    "the three - dimensional action ( that increases with temperature ) has therefore to be much smaller than the electroweak scale : s_3(t_nv ) 142 t_n 142 t_c e^-n_e v   .",
    "this requires the potential barrier at zero temperature to be very small and we are thus led to the parameter region near the conformal case ( in the conformal limit the barrier and the three - dimensional tunnel action vanish ) .",
    "in particular , the parameter @xmath27 can not be much larger than in the conformal case .",
    "however we know that near the conformal case the higgs vev does not get stuck at the origin : in fact the phase transition occurs already at temperatures of electroweak size , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_pttemps ] .",
    "the fact that @xmath57 in the conformal case can be understood as follows : the potential difference between the symmetric minimum and the broken minimum is in this case given by [ eq_vdiff ] v(v )  .",
    "the comparison of eq .",
    "( [ eq_vdiff ] ) with the thermal contributions to the potential in eq .",
    "( [ eq_pot_thermal ] ) shows that the temperature @xmath36 where the two minima are degenerate is of order of the higgs mass . at the same time",
    ", the potential barrier between the minima is absent at zero temperature , arising solely by temperature effects .",
    "therefore one expects that the phase transition takes place with a nucleation temperature @xmath37 of order @xmath36 .",
    "in particular , the temperatures @xmath37 and @xmath36 increase with increasing higgs mass .",
    "all this agrees with the numerical results as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pttemps ] .",
    "the second scenario is that the minimum at the origin does not decay by thermal fluctuations but rather through vacuum ( quantum ) tunneling  @xcite . instead of  ( [ eq_rate_3d ] )",
    ", the tunneling rate for vacuum decay is given by [ eq_rate_4d ] _ 4 v^4  , where @xmath58 denotes the four - dimensional tunnel action  .",
    "above some ( small ) temperature the three - dimensional bounce solution should be considered instead . ] and @xmath59 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "also in this case the first - order phase transition should not proceed arbitrarily slow and percolation requires , similarly to eq .",
    "( [ eq_140 ] ) , s_4(t_n ) 4 ( ) 142 - 8 ( )  . in order to assure that the minimum at the origin does not decay by thermal fluctuations , we should be in a parameter region",
    "in which there is a sufficiently large barrier at zero @xmath60 .",
    "this occurs when @xmath27 is larger than its conformal value that can be read off ( for a fixed higgs mass ) from fig .",
    "[ fig_ptab ] .",
    "numerically , one finds that in this large - barrier regime the quantum tunneling probability is suppressed ( @xmath61 ) , such that quantum tunneling can not provide a graceful exit .",
    "this result was to be expected , since to obtain stability under thermal fluctuations , a barrier comparable to the difference in vacuum energy is mandatory . in such regime",
    "the tunneling actions can be calculated using the thin - wall approximation and one finds the scaling behavior s_3(t ) v^2 , s_4(t ) ^3  .",
    "this shows that , for @xmath62 , quantum tunneling is typically as unlikely as tunneling by thermal fluctuations .    as a conclusion",
    "we see that , in general , low - scale inflation with only one field seems to require two amply separate scales as for example in the case discussed in  @xcite .    to end this section we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : actions ] the typical behavior of the tunneling actions , @xmath63 and @xmath58 , as functions of the temperature for @xmath64 gev and two choices of @xmath27 . for @xmath65",
    ", @xmath63 gets eventually below the critical nucleation value @xmath66 ( horizontal line ) , and the electroweak phase transition takes place . for",
    "@xmath67 no satisfactory transition would occur as the strong suppression will hinder percolation .      during a strongly first - order phase transition",
    "the wall velocity of the expanding nucleated bubbles is an important parameter .",
    "for example , the standard picture of electroweak baryogenesis is based on the diffusion of charge - asymmetries into the unbroken phase in front of the wall .",
    "this effect is strongly suppressed if the wall expansion is supersonic , making electroweak baryogenesis implausible . on the other hand",
    ", gravitational wave production requires large wall velocities .",
    "hence , baryogenesis and gravitational wave production at electroweak scales seem to be mutually exclusive  @xcite .",
    "the wall velocity does not only depend on the thermo - dynamical characteristics of the phase transition , but also on the particle content of the plasma .",
    "in particular , bosonic degrees of freedom that are massless before the phase transition but become heavy due to a strong coupling to the higgs vev exert a strong friction force on the wall  @xcite . in this way the presence of many hidden - sector scalars leads to subsonic wall velocities and the phase transition proceeds by _",
    "deflagration_. following the arguments of  @xcite , in the present case the friction is dominated by the scalars and is given by [ eq_def_fric ] ( m_s l )  , where @xmath68 denotes the thickness of the bubble wall during the phase transition and @xmath69 is the squared debye mass of the hidden - sector scalars .",
    "the expansion of the bubbles is driven by the pressure produced by the latent heat , @xmath70 .",
    "if the friction forces are large , @xmath71 , the wall velocity can be estimated to be @xmath72 .",
    "comparison with  ( [ eq_def_fric ] ) shows that this is the case if the phase transition is weak , in the sense that @xmath73 .    in the opposite regime ,",
    "in which friction effects from the plasma on the bubble wall are negligible , one expects the phase transition to proceed by _",
    "detonation_. in this case the bubble wall velocity can be determined by a self - consistent calculation that leads to supersonic wall velocities  @xcite . the wall velocity is then approximately given by [ vb ] v_b =  , where @xmath43 is the latent heat normalized to the energy density of the plasma as given in  ( [ eq_def_alpha ] ) .",
    "in fact , this value for the wall velocity is only an upper bound , since a larger class of detonation solutions is known to exist  @xcite , but we use nevertheless this formula in the analysis of gravitational wave production .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig_ptab ] show that in principle both possibilities can occur in hidden - sector scalar extensions of the sm without significant tuning .",
    "another smoking - gun signal of a cosmological first - order phase transition is gravitational wave ( gw ) radiation .",
    "when the higgs bubbles nucleate and expand , a portion of the latent heat is transformed into kinetic energy of the higgs field and also into bulk motion of the plasma that follows the passing bubble wall profile .",
    "when the bubbles finally percolate and collide , this energy is partially released into gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the only parameters that enter into the analysis of the gravitational wave radiation by collisions are the latent heat normalized to the radiation energy @xmath43 , the wall velocity of the bubbles @xmath45 and the duration of the phase transition @xmath74 .    in principle",
    ", there might be additional mechanisms of gw production , as _",
    "e.g. _ turbulence in the plasma  @xcite and/or magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "however , for very strong phase transitions , the peak frequency of the gw spectrum is shifted to lower frequencies and mostly the high frequency part of the gw spectrum lies in the range of best experimental sensitivity of the planned space - based experiments .",
    "the contributions from bubble collisions usually dominate for @xmath75 , such that at the frequency of best sensitivity of lisa or bbo , it suffices to consider the contributions from collisions",
    ". a more complete discussion of these issues can be found in  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we summarize the formulas for gw production by bubble collisions as recently presented in  @xcite .",
    "the peak frequency is given by f_peak 10.2 10 ^ -3 ( ) ( ) ( )  , whereas the energy density in gws amounts to h^2 _ peak = 1.84 10 ^ -6 ^2 ( ) ^2  .",
    "the efficiency factor @xmath76 indicates the fraction of latent heat that is transformed into bulk motion of the plasma and finally into gravitational waves .",
    "it is given by  @xcite [ kappa ] =  .",
    "the best sensitivity of bbo ( lisa ) is at @xmath77 mhz ( @xmath78 mhz ) expected to be @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "considering that the gw spectrum from collisions scales approximately as @xmath81 for large frequencies  @xcite , one obtains for bbo a signal to sensitivity ratio 1.87 10 ^ 7 ^2 ( ) ^2 ( ) ( ) ( ) , and for lisa a value that is smaller by four orders of magnitude .",
    "comparison with the parameters of the phase transition in fig .",
    "[ fig_ptab ] shows that , in the present model a signal that is detectable by bbo is feasible , if the parameter @xmath27 is rather close to the critical point @xmath51 beyond which no thermal tunneling occurs , requiring a tuning in @xmath27 at the percent level .",
    "for example , the parameters = 0.2 , /h = 200,t_f = 50 , lead to [ using ( [ vb ] ) and ( [ kappa ] ) ] v_b = 0.83 , = 0.20 , and to a signal to sensitivity ratio of @xmath82 . on the other hand ,",
    "no observable traces from the electroweak phase transition are expected at lisa in the present model .      in this section",
    "we investigate if the new scalar degrees of freedom constitute a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "for simplicity we consider only one hidden - sector scalar as the generalization to several scalars is straightforward .",
    "singlet dark matter has already been extensively discussed in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . here",
    "we focus on two aspects .",
    "first , we discuss if the same scalar species might be responsible both for a strong phase transition and for dark matter ( ref .",
    "@xcite addresses the same question in a different extension of the higgs sector ) .",

    "again , such weakly coupled scalars can not increase the strength of the phase transition considerably .",
    "in particular , a classically conformal model requires several additional , strongly coupled scalars to surpass the current bounds on the higgs mass , see fig .",
    "[ fig_ptab ] .    in conclusion",
    ", if extra scalar degrees of freedom are responsible for a strong electroweak first - order phase transition , as well as for dark matter , it seems that either the coupling constants @xmath103 or the mass terms @xmath104 are non - universal .",
    "scalar dark matter requires either a scalar with a rather large mass @xmath105 tev , or a rather weak coupling @xmath106 .",
    "however both types of scalars can not contribute significantly to the strength of the phase transition .",
    "hence , the existence of both features in a universal scalar framework would require a very large number of scalars , which we estimate to be @xmath107 .",
    "we have studied several cosmological implications of standard model extensions with hidden - sector scalars . in particular , we strengthen the results of @xcite finding that in models with a moderate number of hidden - sector scalars , @xmath108 , the electroweak phase transition is generically of first - order as long as the higgs mass is not much larger than the electroweak scale and the coupling to the hidden sector is substantial , @xmath109 . an interesting feature of the model is that this property persists even if the theory is classically conformal invariant and the electroweak scale is induced by dimensional transmutation .",
    "this was already emphasized in ref .",
    "we find that the phase transition is in a large portion of the parameter space strong enough to suppress the sphaleron process after the phase transition , @xmath110 as required by electroweak baryogenesis . besides , we find that sizable production of gravitational radiation requires a tuning of the parameters at the percent level .",
    "besides a strong first - order phase transition , viable electroweak baryogenesis requires sizable cp violation .",
    "electroweak baryogenesis in non - susy models typically utilizes a higgs vev that has a changing complex phase during the phase transition .",
    "one useful ingredient hence seems to be to complexify the present scalars and to allow for scalar vevs , but still this would not induce a change in the complex phase of the higgs vev such that the introduction of a second higgs doublet seems unavoidable .",
    "alternatively , one can introduce an additional source of cp violation in the quark sector ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) but undoubtedly cp violation arising from the hidden sector would be much more appealing in our model .    concerning dark matter , we find that the abundance required by the concordance model can be provided by hidden - sector scalars in two different regimes . in the first , the hidden - sector scalars have moderate couplings but large masses @xmath111 tev . in the second , the hidden - sector scalars are rather light , @xmath112 . in this case",
    ", the scalars can not annihilate into w - bosons , which greatly enhances the dark matter abundance .",
    "notice that this scenario is compatible with scalars that obtain their mass solely by electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "nevertheless , neither type of scalar can contribute significantly to the strength of the phase transition , such that a viable dark matter candidate can not substantially improve the prospects of electroweak baryogenesis compared to the sm .",
    "hence , a simultaneous solution of the dark matter and baryogenesis problems of the standard model close to electroweak scales either requires a large number of scalars ( in which case we found @xmath107 ) , or several types of scalars in the hidden sector with non - uniform masses and/or couplings to the higgs sector .",
