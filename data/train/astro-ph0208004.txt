    "samples of nearby halo stars can be analyzed to find the bulk properties of the population : their velocity , spatial , and metallicity distributions , as well as their luminosity function .",
    "the principal difficulty is obtaining a sample that is large enough to draw statistically significant conclusions while still not being contaminated with disk and thick disk stars , which locally outnumber halo stars by a factor @xmath2 .",
    "the most secure method to construct such a sample would be to obtain parallaxes , proper motions , and radial velocities for a larger , unbiased sample of stars and then select halo stars based on their space motions",
    ". the gaia satellite would be able to do this , but even under the most optimistic projections , its data will not be available for well over a decade .    in the absence of such ideal datasets ,",
    "most nearby halo samples have been culled from catalogs of high proper - motion stars ( although there are a few notable exceptions to this rule ) .",
    "for example , @xcite obtained trig parallaxes for about 100 proper - motion selected stars , thereby determining their transverse velocities , distances , and absolute magnitudes . by rigorous selection on transverse velocity ( @xmath3 ) , they obtained a sample that was virtually free of disk and thick - disk contamination .",
    "the distances and absolute magnitudes then allowed them to measure the luminosity function ( lf ) .",
    "of course , to do so they had to correct for the halo stars that were eliminated from their sample ( along with the unwanted disk stars ) by their stringent velocity criterion , and this in turn required a model of the halo velocity distribution .",
    "the best such model up to that date was constructed by @xcite , who used maximum likelihood to decompose two proper - motion selected samples into disk , thick disk , and halo components making use of both photometric and proper - motion data .",
    "they thereby identified different populations within the data , even though individual stars could not generally be unambiguously associated with a specific population .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that the likelihood fit was significantly improved by allowing for a third `` intermediate '' or thick disk population rather than just two .",
    "the kinematics of the halo when so fit were more extreme than in the 2-component fit earlier obtained by @xcite because thick - disk contamination was drastically reduced .",
    "rr lyrae stars are halo tracers selected on variability rather than proper motion .",
    "estimates of the rr lyrae absolute magnitude from statistical parallax automatically yield the velocity ellipsoid .",
    "while this technique has been applied for almost a century , only in the last decade or so has it been realized that the rr lyrae samples are actually mixtures of thick - disk and halo stars .",
    "since statistical parallax uses both radial velocities ( whose spectra also yield metallicity information ) and proper motions , and since it derives distances for all stars , full kinematic as well as metallicity information is generally available . in a series of papers , @xcite both systematized pre - existing data and",
    "obtained substantial new data , thereby laying the basis for a new statistical parallax solution that clearly separated the thick - disk and halo populations using a combination of kinematic and metallicity criteria @xcite . @xcite and @xcite ( collectively pg@xmath4 ) introduced new mathematical methods and on this basis conducted a thorough overhaul of the @xcite sample , recalibrating much of the old photographic photometry , incorporating more modern extinctions , identifying suspicious astrometry , and developing a new method to incorporate non - rr - lyrae radial velocities into the analysis .    of particular note in the present context ,",
    "pg@xmath4 were the first to measure five of the nine components of the halo velocity ellipsoid : all previous analyses had measured the three diagonal components of the velocity dispersion tensor and the component of bulk motion in the tangential direction ( the asymmetric drift ) , but had assumed that the off - diagonal components as well as the bulk motion in the radial and vertical directions were zero . while the pg@xmath4 measurements all turned out to be consistent with zero ( in the frame of the local standard of rest  lsr ) , the error bars were tantalizingly close to being able to probe some interesting scientific questions .",
    "the bulk motion of the halo in the radial and vertical directions is more likely to coincide with the rest frame of the galaxy than is the motion of the lsr .",
    "the lsr could well be on an elliptical orbit , in which case it would be moving towards or away from the galacitic center unless the sun happened to lie at an extremum of this orbit .",
    "indeed , @xcite claimed that the lsr is moving outward at @xmath5 based on radial - velocity measurements of gas in the outer galaxy ( assumed to be on circular orbits ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite concluded that the lsr was moving inward at @xmath6 based on radial velocities of carbon stars in the outer galaxy .",
    "similarly , if the milky way disk is warped , then one would expect the lsr to be moving either up or down relative to the galactic rest frame , unless the sun happened to be at an extremum of the warp .",
    "@xcite found that sgr a * is moving down at @xmath7 relative to the lsr .",
    "if the supermassive black hole associated with sgr a * is assumed to be at rest with respect to the galaxy , then this apparent motion would actually be a reflex of the warped motion of the lsr .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite find that sgr a * is moving in the opposite direction ( although with much larger errors ) at @xmath8 .",
    "new more precisements measurements are expected soon ( m.  reid , private communication 2001 ) .    for a roughly isotropic ensemble of @xmath9 stars",
    ", the bulk motion @xmath10 can be measured with a precision , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dispersion in the @xmath13th directin and @xmath14 is the number of components of the velocity measured for each star . for the pg@xmath4 sample , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , while @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "hence @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the pg@xmath4 measurement errors were therefore not quite small enough to probe these interesting questions .",
    "of course , measurement of a difference between the bulk - halo and lsr velocities would not be unambiguous evidence of lsr motion @xcite .",
    "for example , the angular momentum vector of material infalling onto the milky way could have radically changed between the time of the formation of the halo and disk .",
    "the former therefore could in principle be rotating in a basically polar orbit ( albeit with low mach number ) relative to the latter .",
    "hence any sort of relative motion would be intriguing evidence of a non - simple galaxy whose exact origins would have to be sorted out making use of other data and arguments .",
    "similarly , the off - diagonal elements of the velocity dispersion tensor ( normalized to the diagonal elements ) @xmath21 could potentially provide evidence of asymmetries of the galaxy that would reflect on its origins .",
    "the errors in these quantities are @xmath22 , or about 8% for the rr lyrae sample . to the best of my knowledge",
    ", no one has investigated what might cause these quantities to differ from zero , so i do not know whether their consistency with zero at the 8% level challenges or confirms any theory",
    ". nevertheless , it seems interesting to try to probe the off - diagonal elements at higher precision .",
    "the status of the lf and local density of the stellar halo are also somewhat controversial .",
    "@xcite find that the lf peaks at around @xmath23 , in qualitative agreement with the shape of the lf seen in undisturbed globular clusters @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite find a roughly flat lf over the interval @xmath24 .",
    "while @xcite and @xcite both studied local stars drawn from proper - motion catalogs , @xcite adopted a radically different approach : they located stars in _ hubble space telescope _",
    "images that were too faint at their observed color to be in the disk and so were assigned absolute magnitudes and distances based on a halo color - magnitude relation .",
    "these stars were generally quite distant ( @xmath25kpc ) and therefore perhaps not directly comparable to the local samples .",
    "@xcite had earlier suggested that the stellar halo actually has two components , one roughly spheroidal and one highly flattened .",
    "( the highly flattened component is not to be confused with the thick disk : it is not rotating significantly . )  in their model , the two components have roughly equal densities at the solar circle .",
    "such a model predicts that the halo density should be roughly twice as great in the solar neighborhood as it is at a similar galactocentric radius but a few kpc above the galactic plane .",
    "indeed , @xcite found a halo density that was lower than the @xcite measurements by just this fraction .",
    "recently @xcite have argued on the basis of a sample of 70,000 stars along multiple pencil beams that even a 2-component halo model is inadequate to explain their star counts .",
    "the newly released revised nltt catalog @xcite allows one to obtain a very large and very clean sample of halo stars .",
    "the reduced proper - motion ( rpm ) diagram using the newly obtained @xmath26 colors clearly separates main - sequence stars , subdwarfs , and white dwarfs into different tracks @xcite in sharp contrast to rpm diagram constructed from the original nltt @xcite .",
    "although the first release of this catalog covers only 44% of the sky , it contains more than 5000 local halo stars , well over an order of magnitude more than have ever been cleanly distinguished from disk stars on a star - by - star basis .",
    "this sample therefore opens the way to a much more detailed study of the local halo population than has previously been possible . in its present form",
    ", the sample does have some limitations .",
    "since most of its stars lack radial velocities and parallaxes , it is not possible to establish the absolute distances or the amplitude of the velocity ellipsoid based on the revised nltt catalog alone .",
    "nevertheless , the amplitude of the velocity ellipsoid is already known with a precision of about 10% from previous studies , and by incorporating this external information one can obtain much more precise measurements of the five components of the ellipsoid that are currently poorly measured : @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath21 . once the velocity scale is set , the mean distances to the stars are also determined , which permits one to measure the lf .",
    "the large number of stars in the sample therefore offers the hope of probing the bottom of the subdwarf sequence which , because of its dimness , is poorly represented in magnitude limited samples .",
    "finally , the catalog contains a large number of stars from the galactic plane to about @xmath29pc above the plane , where @xmath30 is the typical transverse speed seen toward the galactic poles and @xmath31 is the proper - motion limit of the catalog . while this distance is short compared to the several kpc s hypothesized as the height of the flattened halo component , the large number of stars in the sample may yield a statistically significant statement about the presence of a density gradient on these larger scales .",
    "maximum - likelihood ( ml ) analysis is absolutely critical for extracting halo parameters from this catalog .",
    "for example , since the mean tangential velocity of stars seen toward the galactic poles is @xmath32 , one might naively expect that the stars selected toward the poles would have , on average , this velocity . however , given the fact that the sample is proper - motion limited , for all but the dimmest absolute magnitudes the number of stars seen with velocities that are @xmath33 higher than average ( @xmath34 ) is @xmath35 times higher than the number with velocities that are @xmath33 lower ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this severe selection bias does not _",
    "directly _ affect any other parameters .",
    "however , it couples through the highly uneven ( but perfectly known ) sky coverage from 2mass , to _ indirectly _ affect essentially all other parameters .",
    "these effects can only be removed by comparing the predictions of models with the observations , as ml does automatically .",
    "hence , i begin in   [ sec : maxlike ] by giving a careful summary of the ml modeling procedure . in   [ sec : results ] , i present my results and comment on various aspects of these whose interpretation requires caution . finally , in   [ sec : discuss ] , i compare my results to previous work and briefly discuss the implications of this comparison .",
    "i reserve to the appendix a somewhat technical discussion of the problems in determining the completeness of the revised nltt catalog and the impact of this completeness on parameter estimation .",
    "i use ml to estimate the parameters of the stellar halo . in general , a given dataset is described by @xmath37 observables @xmath38 , which i collectively denote @xmath39 .",
    "if this @xmath37-dimensional space of observables is divided into bins of volume @xmath40 , then the likelihood of detecting @xmath41 objects in the @xmath42th bin is @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the probability density predicted by a given model . if the bins are now made sufficiently small that @xmath46 , then @xmath47 and hence @xmath48 .",
    "the logarithm of the product of the likelihoods from all the bins is therefore , @xmath49 the last term is just the total number of detections expected in the model , @xmath50 . since the @xmath41 in the first term",
    "are either 0 or 1 , equation ( [ eqn : lnlike1 ] ) can be rewritten , @xmath51   - n_{\\rm exp}. \\label{eqn : lnlike2}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the total number of detections . in general , however , the probability density is not most naturally written directly as a function of the observables @xmath38 , but rather of the model coordinates , @xmath53 , which are evaluated at the observables .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : lnlike2 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of these , @xmath54{\\cal j}\\ }   -n_{\\rm exp } + n_\\det\\sum_{i=1}^m\\ln \\delta z_{\\obs , i}. \\label{eqn : lnlike3}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the jacobian of the transformation from the observables to the model coordinates . for a given set of observations ,",
    "the last term is the same for all models and so can be dropped .",
    "in the present case , for each star there are six observables : the angular position on the sky @xmath56 , the proper motion @xmath57 , and the two photometric magnitudes @xmath58 .",
    "there are also six model coordinates : the three spatial coordinates @xmath59 , the two components of transverse velocity @xmath60 , and the absolute magnitude , @xmath61 .",
    "hence , @xmath62 to evaluate @xmath55 , i write @xmath63 and @xmath61 as implicit functions of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , making use of the color - magnitude relation , @xmath66 $ ] . @xmath67 + 1},\\quad m_v =   f\\biggl[v - j-{a_v(r)\\over r_{vj}}\\biggr ] ,",

    ". partial differentiation of equation ( [ eqn : disrel ] ) yields the matrix equation , @xmath70 whose determinant gives , @xmath71 if the reddening vector were parallel to the subdwarf sequence @xmath72 , then the additional term @xmath73 in equation ( [ eqn : jacfull ] ) would be negligible .",
    "in fact , however , this ratio is roughly @xmath74 , which means that at typical distances @xmath75pc and low galactic latitudes , @xmath76 , and so it can not be ignored .",
    "note that the prefactor @xmath77 is an irrelevant constant and can be dropped in practical calculations , so that @xmath78 .",
    "i model the stellar halo distribution as the product of a luminosity function ( lf ) , a velocity distribution , and a density profile .",
    "in addition , halo stars are assumed to obey a linear color - magnitude relation @xmath79 = a(v - j)_0 + b.    \\label{eqn : cmr}\\ ] ] in principle , one might also assume that this relation has some intrinsic dispersion .",
    "however , for reasons that i discuss below , i do not include such a parameter in the model .",
    "finally , not all halo stars satisfying the selection criteria will be detected .",
    "i therefore include in the model two parameters @xmath80 that describe the completeness as a function of apparent @xmath64 magnitude .",
    "@xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 this form is motivated by the fact that nltt is known to be complete to at least @xmath84 away from the plane , and the revised catalog has captured essentially all of these stars @xcite .",
    "the completeness falls precipitously at faint magnitudes , @xmath85 .",
    "the simplest hypothesis is that it is linear over the intervening magnitudes .",
    "i model the lf with 13 free parameters , one for each magnitude bin centered at @xmath86 to @xmath87 .",
    "i model the velocity distribution as a gaussian ellipsoid with 9 parameters : three for the bulk motion , @xmath10 , three for the diagonal components of the dispersion tensor , @xmath12 , and three for the off - diagonal components @xmath88 @xmath89 . in practice ,",
    "i use the normalized components of the latter ( the correlation coefficients ) @xmath90 .",
    "it is known that the halo velocity distribution is highly non - gaussian , with a kurtosis that is higher than gaussian in the vertical direction , lower than gaussian in the radial direction , and roughly gaussian in the direction of rotation ( pg@xmath4 ) . however , modeling the non - gaussian character of the distribution would be quite complicated , and it is straight forward to show that a ml fit of a non - gaussian distribution to a gaussian model returns unbiased estimates of the first two moments . hence there is no benefit to modelling the non - gaussian form of the distribution unless one wants to investigate the higher moments of the distribution . since these are not a focus of interest in the current paper , i opt for the simpler gaussian model .",
    "i model the halo distribution as falling as a power law with galactocentric distance @xmath91 and exponentially with distance from the galactic plane @xmath92 , i.e. @xmath93 . the spatial distribution is therefore described by two parameters , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , where @xmath95 may be regarded as the inverse scale height .",
    "i adopt @xmath96kpc .",
    "hence , i begin with 28 free parameters , 13 for the lf , 9 for the velocity ellipsoid , 2 for the color - magnitude relation , 2 for the completeness fucntion , and 2 for the density profile . however , as i now explain , there is one almost perfect degeneracy among these parameters , and therefore one of them must be fixed . if the zero - point @xmath97 of the color - magnitude relation ( eq .  [ [ eqn : cmr ] ] ) is increased by @xmath98 , and all the bulk velocities @xmath10 and dispersions @xmath99 are reduced by @xmath100 , then all of the model s predicted proper motions will remain unchanged . the only difference will be that a star s absolute magnitude ( inferred from its color ) will be increased by @xmath101 , and so the inferred density of stars of each resulting magnitude bin will be increased by @xmath102 . actually , this scaling remains perfect only in the limit @xmath103 , but since the extinction is quite small , the degeneracy is almost perfect .",
    "i therefore fix @xmath104 the value measured by @xcite for their `` kinematically selected '' sample of halo rr lyrae stars . @xcite",
    "also evaluated the velocity ellipsoid for a `` non - kinematically selected '' sample of halo stars , the magnitude of whose @xmath105 component is somewhat smaller than given by equation ( [ eqn : gpu2 ] ) .",
    "however , as i describe in ",
    "[ sec : selcrit ] below , the present sample is effectively selected using a combination of kinematic and metallicty criteria , just as was true for the @xcite `` kinematically selected '' sample .",
    "therefore , the scale of the velocity ellipsoid should be fixed by the `` kinmatically selected '' rather than the @xcite `` non - kinematically selected '' sample .    finally ,",
    "as noted above , i do not include a parameter for the dispersion in the color - magnitude relation despite the fact that the halo is known to contain a range of metallicities , and therefore a range of absolute magnitudes at fixed color , and hence some dispersion @xmath106 .",
    "since i do not include this term , the velocity dispersions found by the ml fit will be larger than the true dispersions by @xmath107 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{eqn : ciichange}\\ ] ] hence , in principle , if one knew the @xmath12 sufficiently well , one could fix them ( or one of them or their sum ) , and fit for @xmath106 .",
    "however , as i will show in   [ sec : results ] ,",
    "the differences @xmath108 are smaller than the present uncertainties in the @xmath12 , and therefore this is not a practical possibility .",
    "thus , the fit parameters that i am calling `` @xmath12 '' are actually shorthand labels for @xmath109 .",
    "this means that the derived parameters will not yield new determinations for the @xmath12 .",
    "the best one can do is use these measurements to place rough upper limits on @xmath106 .",
    "that is , among the nine velocity - ellipsoid parameters @xmath10 , @xmath12 , @xmath21 , new values will be obtained for only five : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath21 .      among the six observables",
    "@xmath110 only the @xmath64 magnitude has significant errors .",
    "the angular coordinates @xmath56 are known to @xmath111mas , about 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the scale on which there are significant density gradients .",
    "the proper - motion errors are @xmath112 or 3% of the nltt proper - motion threshold . since the intrinsic dispersion in proper motions is of order unity , and",
    "since the measurement errors add in quadrature to these , these errors are utterly negligible .",
    "the @xmath64 errors are about 0.25 mag @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , these are multiplied by 2.1 when entering the rpm and therefore can not be ignored .",
    "finally , the @xmath65 errors are typically 0.03 mag .",
    "even though they enter the rpm with somewhat higher weight ( 3.1 ) , they are then added in quadrature to the @xmath64 errors , and so are also negligible .",
    "the errors in the original nltt proper motions were @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "these proper motions are not used directly in the evaluation of the likelihood , but they do have an indirect effect because they influenced luyten s determination of which stars met his proper - motion threshold of @xmath114 and so which ultimately entered the revised nltt catalog @xcite .",
    "one wishes to select as large a sample of halo stars as possible , while effectively excluding stars from other populations .",
    "moreover , one would like to restrict selection to those areas of the sky with homogeneous completeness characteristics . to achieve the first goal ,",
    "i make use of the discriminator @xmath115 introduced by @xcite , @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the rpm . using the @xmath118 rpm diagram",
    ", @xcite showed that stars in the range @xmath119 are mostly halo stars . to be conservative",
    ", i restrict the selection by an additional magnitude on each end and require @xmath120 ( see fig .  3 from @xcite ) .",
    "completeness of the original nltt catalog deteriorates significantly in areas south of poss i , and @xcite did not even attempt to recover faint nltt stars in this region because their method can not be applied there .",
    "i therefore require @xmath121 .",
    "@xcite showed that in the galactic latitude interval @xmath122 , nltt completeness of main - sequence stars is severely affected , dropping from neighboring zones at higher latitude by a factor @xmath123 while the effect is much smaller for subdwarfs ( and perhaps negligible for white dwarfs ) , to be conservative , i restrict selection to stars outside this range .",
    "finally , of course , the identifications by @xcite rely critically on 2mass , and so have only been carried out for the 47% of the sky ( 57% of the region @xmath121 ) that is covered by the second incremental 2mass release .",
    "hence , the spatial selection function alone is quite complex .",
    "this fact , together with the large number of observables , implies that great care is required to evaluate the likelihood function .",
    "note that the discriminator @xmath115 ( eq .  [ [ eqn : eta ] ] ) is effectively a function of both kinematics and metallicity .",
    "that is , @xmath115 increases both with higher transverse velocity and with lower metallicity ( and so lower luminosity at fixed color ) .",
    "it is for this reason that i said in ",
    "[ sec : modparms ] that the sample is selected using a combination of kinematic and metallicity criteria .      in order to find the model parameters that maximize the likelihood",
    ", one must compare in a consistent way the likelihood of observing the data given different sets of model parameters .",
    "this statement is so obvious that it would appear not worth mentioning .",
    "however , achieving such consistency is by no means trivial .",
    "the first term in equation ( [ eqn : lnlike3 ] ) is relatively straight forward to calculate because it depends only on differential probability functions that are multiplied together .",
    "however , the second term , the total number of stars expected to enter the sample for a given model is quite complicated in several respects .",
    "first , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : selcrit ] the selection criteria themselves are complex .",
    "second , to estimate @xmath50 requires an integral over nine dimensions : six for the model coordinates @xmath124 , plus three for the measurement errors @xmath125 .",
    "recall that even though i am not making use of the nltt proper - motion measurements , they still enter the likelihood function because they affect the sample selection .",
    "integration over more than four dimensions is in general more efficiently carried out by monte carlo than directly . in the present case , the complexity of the 2mass coverage further reinforces the advantages of monte carlo integration .",
    "however , such an approach poses significant difficulties when comparing likelihood estimates at different locations in parameter space : monte carlo integration introduces poisson fluctuations into the evaluation of @xmath50 which are of order the square root of the size of the random sample . while these fluctuations can to some extent be suppressed by insisting that all realizations have the same sample size , the induced fluctuations remain of the same order . to be certain that these do not induce roughness in the ml surface of order unity",
    "would require monte carlo samples of @xmath126 , which would be computationally prohibiive .    to counter this problem , rather than directly assembling a separate catalog of fake stars for each model , i assemble a single catalog of fake stars and assign the stars different weights according to the model .",
    "that is , i first choose a baseline model that is reasonably close to the final model .",
    "for each magnitude bin , i assign an absolute magnitude drawn uniformly over this bin , a physical location drawn uniformly from the volume within 1 kpc of the sun , and a transverse velocity drawn randomly from the 2-dimensional gaussian projected - velocity distribution expected in the baseline model .",
    "i note the gaussian probability of each such fake star , but do not at this point make use of it .",
    "next i determine the observational characteristics of the star .",
    "for example , i use the color - magnitude relation of the baseline model and the star s distance to obtain the true @xmath127 color and @xmath128 magnitude .",
    "i draw the error in the observed @xmath64 magnitude from a gaussian distribution , and redden both the color and magnitude according to a simplified extinction law , @xmath129 \\label{eqn : av}\\ ] ] where @xmath130pc is the dust scale height .",
    "similarly , i obtain the true proper motion from the distance and transverse velocity and draw the two nltt proper - motion errors from a gaussian distribution . if the nltt proper motion exceeds @xmath114 , and the rpm discriminator @xmath115 lies within somewhat expanded bounds @xmath131",
    "as calculated within the baseline model , i accept the star into a master list of fake stars . for each model",
    "i examine each star on this master list and recalculate @xmath132 using the model s color - magnitude relation .",
    "i accept only stars satisfying the selection criterion @xmath133 as calculated within the model .",
    "next , i determine @xmath50 by counting all of the fake stars thus accepted and assigning each one a weight that depends on the model .",
    "the weight is a product of factors : @xmath134 for proximity to the galactic center , @xmath135 for distance from the galactic plane , @xmath136 to take account of completeness , as well as a factor for the luminosity function of the star s",
    "@xmath61 bin .",
    "in particular , i evaluate the probability of the transverse velocity given the model and divide this by the tabulated probability of the baeline model . in this way , @xmath50 is evaluated stochastically for an ensemble of models , without introducing random noise into the _ relative _ values obtained for different models .    for purposes of finding the best - fit model ,",
    "i use a catalog of fake stars drawn from a model that is 100 times denser than the actual stellar halo , so that the stochastic character of the fake catalog introduces errors in the parameter estimates that are 10 times smaller than the poisson errors .",
    "i use bootstrap to calculate the errors in the parameters , i.e. , i evaluate the scatter in model fits to 25 realizations of the data formed by drawing randomly from the actual data with replacement .",
    "each realization is tested against the _ same _ catalog of fake data . for this purpose ,",
    "i use a fake catalog drawn from a model that is 10 times denser than the actual stellar halo .",
    "the best - fit model to the 4588 subdwarfs selected according to the criteria described in   [ sec : selcrit ] has the following characteristics .      for the bulk halo motion relative to the sun , i find @xmath137 in the ( outward ) radial and ( upward ) vertical directions .",
    "since the sun moves relative to the lsr at @xmath138 and @xmath139 in these directions @xcite , this implies that the lsr is moving relative to the halo at @xmath140 radially and @xmath141 vertically .",
    "that is , both components are consistent with zero .",
    "if the halo is assumed to be stationary in both directions relative to the galactic potential , then either the deviations of the lsr from a circular orbit must be very small , or the sun must lie close to the extrema of these deviations . on the other hand , if the halo is not stationary , then it just happens to have almost exactly the same motion as the lsr , which would be a most surprising coincidence .",
    "the errors in equation ( [ eqn : u1u3 ] ) include only the statistical errors within the fit and not the systematic errors induced by fixing the amplitude of the velocity ellipsoid using the @xcite value for @xmath142 .",
    "however , as i now show , this systematic error is relatively small .",
    "first , the statistical error of @xmath105 is @xmath143 or 6% .",
    "this induces a systematic error in @xmath27 also of 6% , that is , @xmath144 which is small compared to the statistical error .",
    "there is a second source of error because , while both the present sample and the @xcite sample were chosen based on a combination of kinematic and metallicity criteria , those criteria are not identical , nor even easily comparable .",
    "hence , the values of @xmath105 for the two samples need not be identical .",
    "it is difficult to judge the size of this systematic error , but it is probably also of order @xmath145 , i.e. , about 5% , and therefore again much smaller than the statistical error .",
    "the systematic errors scale with @xmath10 and therefore are about half as big for the vertical motion as the radial motion .",
    "the three off - diagonal components to the velocity - dispersion tensor are @xmath146 that is , all three are consistent with zero at about the 2% level .",
    "( because there are five velocity - ellipsoid parameters being fit , the @xmath147 `` detection '' of @xmath148 can not be regarded as even marginally significant . )    finally , the three diagonal components are @xmath149 where @xmath108 is defined by equation ( [ eqn : ciichange ] ) .",
    "this can be compared with values of @xmath12 found by @xcite for kinematically selected rr lyrae stars . @xmath150",
    "if the errors in equation ( [ eqn : rrlyraes ] ) were sufficient small , it would be possible to determine the @xmath108 in equation ( [ eqn : cii ] ) and so characterize @xmath106 ( the scatter in @xmath61 at fixed @xmath26 color ) .",
    "see equation ( [ eqn : ciichange ] ) . however , given the errors , it is immediately clear that @xmath106 is consistent with zero . to find out",
    "what upper bound can be put on @xmath106 , i first note that because @xmath151 , most of the potential information comes from the tangential component . at the @xmath33 level , @xmath152 .",
    "hence , from equation ( [ eqn : ciichange ] ) , @xmath153 .",
    "this is not a very interesting @xmath33 limit .",
    "moreover , i have not yet incorporated the statistical or systematic uncertainties in the amplitude of the velocity ellipsoid as discussed following equation ( [ eqn : u1u3 ] ) .",
    "hence , equations ( [ eqn : cii ] ) and ( [ eqn : rrlyraes ] ) present a reasonably consistent picture , but do not significantly constrain @xmath106 .",
    "i do note , however , that the comparison of these two equations shows that the choice for normalizing the velocity ellipsoid , @xmath142 , can not be off by more than about 15% .",
    "if it were , then the fit values for @xmath154 would also change by 15% , and these would then be inconsistent at high significance with the @xmath155 and @xmath156 as measured for rr lyrae stars .",
    "the halo density is not expected to vary much over the small ( @xmath157pc ) volume that is being probed . as discussed in   [ sec : modparms ] , i therefore model the density profile simply as , @xmath158 .",
    "i find , @xmath159 the estimate of @xmath94 is consistent with many previous determinations which , because they are measured over longer baselines , have much small errors .",
    "for example , @xcite find @xmath160 .",
    "the @xmath95 measurement is quite interesting despite the fact that ( or rather precisely because ) it is consistent with zero . at the @xmath161 level , this constrains the scaleheight to be @xmath162kpc .",
    "if the local halo were composed of two components , one highly flattened and one roughly round , then one would expect the density to fall off locally over distances that are short compared 7 kpc .",
    "hence , this result should help constrain 2-component halo models .",
    "i fit for a color - magnitude relation of the form @xmath163 ( eq .  [ [ eqn : cmr ] ] ) and find @xmath164 the formal uncertainties on these parameters are very small , of order 0.01 mag .",
    "however , recall from the discussion above equation ( [ eqn : gpu2 ] ) that @xmath97 is completely degenerate with the amplitude of the velocity ellipsoid , which was fixed for purposes of the fit but which actually has a statistical uncertainty of 6% ( and a comparable systematic error ) . hence , the true error in @xmath97 is about 0.2 mag . the total error in @xmath165 is probably not much larger than the formal error .",
    "the lf is parameterized by 13 separate 1-mag bins , with centers from @xmath166 to @xmath167 .",
    "i find ( as did @xcite when they studied the disk lf ) that ml estimates of the lf tend to magnify poisson fluctuations according to the following mechanism .",
    "first suppose that the true lf has a dip at a certain bin .",
    "observational errors will scatter stars from the two neighboring bins into this bin , thus tending to wash out the dip .",
    "hence , a ml fit , when confronted by a dip in the observed distribution will tend to accentuate it as it reconstructs the underlying ( true ) lf .",
    "now suppose that the true lf is flat over three adjacent bins but because of poisson fluctuations the central bin is depressed .",
    "ml will also accentuate this dip in an attempt to reconstruct the `` true '' lf .",
    "hence , particularly for bins with low total counts , ml can introduce structure that is not really present .",
    "i handle this potential problem by imposing a `` roughness '' penalty @xmath168(difference / sum)@xmath169 , where `` sum '' and `` difference '' refer to the sum and difference of the lf in each pair of neighboring lf bins .",
    "this is equivalent to imposing a @xmath170 penalty when neighboring bins differ by 35% .",
    "thus , if the data really demand a steep gradient , this penalty will permit one , but it will squash spurious gradients .",
    "figure [ fig : one ] shows the resulting lf .",
    "this lf is significantly correlated with the completeness parameters ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : complete ] ] ) , which are derived simultaneously , @xmath171 in the appendix , i consider arguments that might lead one to suspect that this estimate of @xmath172 could be substantially too low .",
    "i find that these arguments are not compelling and therefore adopt the lf calculated using equation ( [ eqn : compfac ] ) as the best estimate . nevertheless , in order to gain a sense of the possible role of such a systematic effect",
    ", i also show in figure [ fig : one ] the lf under the assumption that @xmath173 , the highest value that i consider to be plausible .",
    "figure [ fig : two ] compares the derived lf ( with @xmath174 ) to those of several previous measurements of the halo lf : those of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , which were all previously compared by @xcite .",
    "as explained there , the first two lfs are labelled `` bc / crb '' and `` dlhg / crb '' to indicate that they have been corrected from the originally published lfs to take account of the kinematic selection using the velocity ellipsoid of @xcite , which is very similar to the ellipsoid of @xcite , and to the one derived for the present sample .",
    "the present measurement is in reasonably good agreement with the dlhb / crb determination over the range @xmath175 covered by the latter .",
    "it disagrees strongly with both the bc / crb and @xcite determinations ( which are in good agreement with each other ) .",
    "the new measurement extends over a much wider magnitude range and has substantially smaller error bars than any previous determination .    the lf evaluations at @xmath87 , and to a lesser extent at @xmath176 ,",
    "should be interpreted cautiously because they depend sensitively on model assumptions .",
    "to understand this point , one should consider how ml `` thinks '' when fitting the lf .",
    "to zeroth order , it forms an lf in the naive way : by counting the number of stars whose dereddened observed @xmath127 color and the color - magnitude relation put them in a corresponding @xmath61 bin , and dividing this number by the total effective volume probed by the survey for stars of that @xmath61 .",
    "there are respectively 40 and 18 stars in the final two bins , but only roughly 20 and 6 of these are assigned to these bins by the final ml lf fit shown in figures [ fig : one ] and [ fig : two ] .",
    "what prevents ml from assigning much higher densities to the lf at these faint magnitudes ?",
    "in the next brightest bin there are 159 stars .",
    "this is about four times larger than in the @xmath176 bin despite the fact that the lf is roughly the same because the effective volume grows rapidly with luminosity at these faint magnitudes .",
    "as described above , ml takes this as a zeroth - order estimate for the number expected in this bin .",
    "it then considers how many of these are expected to scatter into neighboring bins because the color errors @xmath177 induce errors in @xmath61 of @xmath178 .",
    "that is , roughly 15% of these 159 stars are expected to scatter into the @xmath176 bin and a few percent into the @xmath87 bin .",
    "it is by accounting for this scatter , as well as scatter form brighter bins , that ml achieves its final estimate .",
    "this estimate therefore depends quite senstively on the adopted value of @xmath179 , which is described very simply in the model , but could in principle actually be a function of @xmath64 or of other variables .",
    "in addition , because of the very small number of detected stars in these final bins , there is a potential problem of contamination from non - halo stars .",
    "contamination is not generally a problem because , as i argued in   [ sec : selcrit ] , the discriminator @xmath115 is limited to regions well away from main - sequence stars and white dwarfs .",
    "however , the density of the very dim stars on the rpm diagram is extremely low ( see fig .  3 from @xcite )",
    ", so even the low residual level of contamination could play a role .    to establish the lf at @xmath180 more securely , and since the total number of stars in the last two bins is very small ( 58 ) , the simplest approach would be to obtain @xmath64-band photometry for all of them .",
    "if the ml result is correct , the majority of these will be found to have scattered in from brighter bins .",
    "metallicities and radial velocities from spectra of the truly red stars could then resolve issues of contamination .",
    "the lf of the final two bins would then rest on much firmer ground .",
    "to high precision ( roughly @xmath0 ) the lsr is not moving with respect to the halo in either the radial or vertical directions .",
    "if the halo itself has no radial motion , the first result sharply contradicts the conclusion of @xcite based on gas motions that the lsr is moving outward at @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is reasonably consistent with the radial - motion estimate of @xcite based on carbon stars .",
    "more specifically , i find that the halo is moving at @xmath181 relative to the sun , and they find that the outer - galaxy carbon stars are moving at @xmath182 .",
    "i find that all three off - diagonal components of the velocity dispersion tensor are small , within @xmath183 of zero .",
    "the only previous measurements of these quantities ( pg@xmath4 ) were consistent with zero , but with errors that were about 4 times larger .",
    "to date , i am not aware of any effort to predict the off - diagonal terms from theory .",
    "the measurement presented here of the lf confirms the basic peaked shape found by @xcite , but with about 40 times more stars and therefore covering a magnitude interval that is roughly twice as large .",
    "it is inconsistent with the flat lf found by @xcite , and @xcite ( although in principle , since the latter determination was based on stars away from the solar neighborhood , it can not be rigorously ruled out by my measurement ) .",
    "the present measurement is in rough agreement with that of @xcite at brighter magnitudes , @xmath184 .",
    "a shortcoming of the present approach is that there is no information about distances within the data set , so the scale of the velocity ellipsoid must be set by external information .",
    "the distance scale could be set by obtaining either radial velocities ( rvs ) or trig parallaxes for a _ representative _",
    "( i.e. , random ) subset of the stars in the sample .",
    "the former would yield a statistical parallax solution .",
    "i stress `` representative '' because if the subsample is biased , for example is weighted toward stars with extreme kinematics and/or low metallicities , then the scale of the velocity ellipsoid will be overestimated by statistical parallax because the stars with rvs move faster than the those in the sample as a whole .",
    "it would be misestimated by trig parallax both because the selected stars would be faster and subluminous compared to the sample as a whole .",
    "hence , one must choose a fair sample , and then make use of archival data only for stars within that sample .    from the standpoint of maximizing the precision of the distance - scale measurement with the minimum effort , statistical parallax is to be much preferred over trig parallax .",
    "even velocity errors of @xmath185 are quite adequate for a statistical parallax measurement with the limiting precision @xmath186 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath187 is the number of stars in the statistical parallax sample and @xmath115 is the distance - scale parameter . even assuming perfect parallaxes , the limit for the trig parallax technique is @xmath188 .",
    "given the large number of halo stars in the revised nltt catalog and the relative ease of making rv compared to trig parallax measurements , the modest per - star advantage of trig parallax will be overwhelmed by the mass - production techniques available for rvs .",
    "however , good trig parallaxes would provide information on the luminosity of individual stars , which can not be obtained from statistical parallax techniques .",
    "thus , the two approaches are complementary .",
    "i thank samir salim for invaluable discussions about both the content and presentation of this paper .",
    "work supported by jpl contract 1226901 .",
    "the principal source of systematic errors in this analysis is incompleteness ( or rather , possible misestimation of the completeness ) of the revised nltt catalog .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : one ] , such misestimation can significantly affect the determination of the lf .",
    "however , i find that it does not affect the estimate of the velocity ellipsoid .    in principle",
    ", catalog completeness could be a function of all six observables , i.e. , the @xmath64 and @xmath65 magnitudes , the proper motion , and the position on the sky . while the _ relative completeness _ of the revised nltt compared to the original nltt",
    "is very well understood @xcite , there is substantially less information available about the _",
    "absolute completeness _ of the underlying nltt .    the completeness of nltt can be tested either externally or internally .",
    "an external check requires an independent search for high proper - motion stars , either over the whole sky or some fraction of it . by comparing to the _ hipparcos _ @xcite and tycho-2 @xcite catalogs",
    ", @xcite concluded that nltt is nearly 100% complete for @xmath189 and for galactic latitudes @xmath190 .",
    "even near to the plane , completeness is close to 100% for @xmath191 .",
    "@xcite searched for high proper - motion ( @xmath191 ) stars to faint magnitudes toward 1378 deg@xmath169 , and found 241 stars , only 17 of which ( their tables 2 and 3 ) they could not match to nltt .",
    "in fact , two of these 17 are actually nltt stars , namely 58785 and 52890 , which correspond to entries 1 and 8 from table 3 .",
    "thus , over these surveyed areas , nltt is @xmath192 complete for @xmath191 .",
    "however , the _ luyten half - second _ ( lhs ) catalog @xcite , a subset of nltt which actually extends somewhat below @xmath193 , is almost certaintly substantially more complete than is the nltt at lower proper motions , so this measurement can not be regarded as representative of nltt as a whole .",
    "unfortunately , there are no sytematic studies comparing nltt detections with an independent search for proper motion stars in the range @xmath194 and at faint magnitudes . in the absence of such _ external _ checks , @xcite conducted an _ internal _ completeness determination , whose approach is very closely related to the completeness measurement carried out here by ml . for a complete sample drawn from a stellar population that is uniformly distributed in space ,",
    "the number of stars in the phase - space volume @xmath195\\times [ v_1,v_2]$ ] , should be ( up to poisson statistics ) exactly 8 times the number in the volume @xmath196\\times [ v_1 - 5\\log 2,v_2 - 5\\log 2]$ ] .",
    "this is because the former physical volume is 8 times larger while the physical velocities being probed are exactly the same .",
    "@xcite made a series of such comparisons at 0.5-magnitude intervals , and by multiplying these together , found that the completeness at @xmath197 is 65% that at @xmath198 ( which latter they assumed to be 100% ) .",
    "@xcite pointed out that _ any _ effect that reduced detections of more distant , slower moving stars ( relative to faster nearby ones ) could masquerade as incompleteness of fainter ( relative to brighter ) stars under this test .",
    "in particular , they argued that more distant stars would , being on average farther from the plane , have reduced density .",
    "even a small difference of 4% in mean density per comparison could lead to the `` observed '' @xmath173 completeness at @xmath199 , since it would be multiplied together 11 times between @xmath198 and 18.5 .",
    "that is , @xmath200 .",
    "@xcite presented a figure showing that when the procedure is carried out on stars at lower galactic latitude , the effect is much reduced .",
    "this critique is important because the 2-parameter characterization of incompleteness that i use here ( see   [ sec : modparms ] ) in essence embodies the @xcite method . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : lf ] , i find @xmath201 at @xmath202 .",
    "this fraction is consistent with the @xcite result at the @xmath203 level when account is taken of the fact that i have assumed 100% completeness at @xmath204 rather than @xmath198 .",
    "the magnitude @xmath205 is slightly brighter than the value found by @xcite , but this is to be expected , since the revised nltt catalog depends on 2mass @xmath65-band cross identification .",
    "however , the @xcite critique can not account for the result found in equation ( [ eqn : compfac ] ) for several reasons .",
    "first , one does not expect the density of halo subdwarfs to fall off significantly within the volume probed by nltt .",
    "second , the ml fit actually allows for such a fall - off , so that even if the actual density did not satisfy this theoretical expectation , the fit would automatically take account of the fall - off .",
    "( in fact according to eq.the best fit is consistent with uniform density . )",
    "third , @xcite are unable to reproduce the @xcite figure 3 and instead find relatively comparable results when they apply their test to high - latitude and low - latitude stars .    nonetheless , it remains possible that there is some _ other _ effect that reduces the counts of distant relative to nearby stars of the same class .",
    "one such effect would be incompleteness as a function of proper motion , rather than magnitude",
    ". such incompleteness could be very pernicious because if the more distant ( and hence slower moving ) stars were under - represented by a mere 4% , then ( as outlined above ) the effect would be exponentiated and would generate a large apparent incompleteness as a function of magnitude .",
    "i therefore tested this hypothesis by including a proper - motion term for the completeness within the ml fit .",
    "however , this term did not improve the fit even slightly .",
    "one is thus left without any plausible explanation for the relative lack of more distant , slower stars , other than incompleteness as a function of magnitude .",
    "the little direct information we have on the completeness of nltt at faint magnitudes and relatively low proper motions is reasonably consistent with the ml estimates of completeness derived here .",
    "@xcite searched for high proper motion stars in a single schmidt field toward the north galactic pole .",
    "he recovered 63 stars from nltt as well as 15 stars that met nltt selection criteria but were not in nltt .",
    "this appears to correspond to a mean completeness of 81% .",
    "however , three of the 15 have proper motions @xmath206 , i.e. , within @xmath33 @xcite of the nltt limit . stars that scatter across the selection boundary",
    "are _ already _ taken into account in the modeling procedure and should not be counted as due to `` incompleteness '' .",
    "hence , the true mean completeness of nltt in the @xcite survey area is more like @xmath207 .",
    "if one restricts consideration to stars @xmath208 ( beyond which the revised nltt catalog is more sensitive to the incompleteness of 2mass than nltt ) , then @xmath209 corresponds to a mean completeness of halo stars of @xmath210 , in @xmath33 agreement with the value just derived from the @xcite study ."
