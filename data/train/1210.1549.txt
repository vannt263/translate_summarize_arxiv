    "there are a variety of ways to model the presence of secrecy in a communication system .",
    "shannon considered the availability of secret key shared between the transmitter ( alice ) and receiver ( bob ) , using it to apply a one - time pad to the message @xcite .",
    "wyner introduced the idea of physical - layer security with the wiretap channel and secrecy capacity , exploiting the difference in the channels to bob and eve ( the eavesdropper ) @xcite .",
    "maurer derived secrecy by assuming that alice , bob , and eve have access to correlated random variables @xcite .",
    "in such models , the measure of security is usually the conditional entropy , or `` equivocation '' , of the message ; maximum equivocation corresponds to perfect secrecy .    in this work ,",
    "we replace equivocation with an operationally motivated measure of secrecy .",
    "we want to design our coding and encryption schemes so that if eve tries to reproduce the source sequence , she will suffer a certain level of distortion .",
    "more precisely , the measure of secrecy is the minimum average distortion attained by the cleverest ( worst - case ) eavesdropper .",
    "occasionally , we will refer to eve s minimum average distortion as the payoff : alice and bob want to maximize the payoff over all code designs .",

    "we assume bob , the legitimate receiver , is producing actions that are revealed publicly ( in particular , to eve ) in a causal manner .",
    "we might view eve as an adversary who is trying to predict bob s current and future actions based on both the actions that she has already witnessed and the output of her wiretap , and subsequently act upon her predictions ( see figure [ source_channel_fig ] ) .    to further motivate the causal disclosure feature of our model , consider the effect of removing it ;",
    "that is , consider yamamoto s problem in @xcite .",
    "alice must communicate a source sequence losslessly to bob over a noiseless channel and the secrecy resource is shared secret key .",
    "eve observes the message but is _ not _ given causal access to bob s reproduction sequence .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the solution to this problem is that any positive rate of secret key is enough to cause eve unconditionally maximal distortion ",
    "we see that secrecy is alarmingly inexpensive .",
    "similarly , if the secrecy resource is physical - layer security instead of shared secret key , it can be shown that a positive secrecy capacity is enough to force maximal distortion . however , with causal disclosure in play a tradeoff between secrecy capacity and payoff emerges . as a side remark , one might observe that causal disclosure is consistent with the spirit of kerckhoffs s principle @xcite .",
    "in addition to assuming causal disclosure , we further diverge from @xcite by considering the presence of a wiretap channel instead of shared secret key ; the problem of shared secret key with causal disclosure was solved in @xcite . in @xcite , it was found that the optimal tradeoff between the rate of secret key and payoff earned is achieved by constructing a message that effectively consists of a fully public part and a fully secure part .",
    "more specifically , the optimal encoder publicly reveals a distorted version of the source sequence and uses the secret key to apply a one - time pad to the supplement . with this insight",
    ", we use the broadcast channel to effectively create two separate channels  one public and one secure   as is done in @xcite .",
    "however , we modify @xcite by removing the requirement that eve must decode the public message , thereby rendering the message public only in intention , not in reality .",
    "we show that freely giving the `` public '' message away dramatically decreases eve s distortion ; thus , her equivocation of the public message becomes important .",
    "upon using channel coding to transform the broadcast channel into effective public and secure channels , we show that the weak secrecy provided by the channel encoder allows us to use the source code from @xcite to link the source and channel coding operations together digitally .",
    "it turns out that a strong secrecy guarantee would not improve the results .",
    "separation allows us to obtain a lower bound on the achievable payoff .",
    "we also provide an example of the lower bound and obtain an upper bound .",
    "most of the proofs are omitted .    before proceeding , we briefly juxtapose our measure of secrecy with equivocation",
    ". equivocation does not give much insight into the structure of eve s knowledge and does not depend on the actions that eve makes .",
    "in contrast , looking at eve s distortion tells us something about the quality of her reconstruction if her aim is to replicate a source sequence and produce actions accordingly .",
    "there are other instances in the literature where an operational definition of security is used .",
    "for example , in @xcite , merhav et al . looked at the expected number of guesses needed to correctly identify a message .",
    "the system under consideration , shown in figure [ source_channel_fig ] , operates on blocks of length @xmath9 .",
    "all alphabets are finite , and both the source and channel are memoryless .",
    "the communication flow begins with alice , who observes a sequence @xmath2 , i.i.d . according to @xmath10 , and produces an input @xmath3 to the broadcast channel .",
    "the memoryless broadcast channel is characterized by @xmath0 , but since the relevant calculations only involve the marginals @xmath11 and @xmath12 , we need only consider @xmath13 . at one end of the channel , bob receives @xmath4 and generates a sequence of actions , @xmath14 , with the requirement that the block error probability be small . at the other terminal of the channel , eve receives @xmath5 and generates @xmath15 ; in generating @xmath7 , she has access to the full @xmath5 sequence and the past actions of bob , @xmath16 .",
    "in essence , we can view bob and eve as playing a public game that commences after they receive the channel outputs . in each move",
    ", they are allowed to see each other s past moves and produce an estimate of the next source symbol accordingly .",
    "since bob s reproduction must be almost lossless , his moves are restricted and he does not benefit from knowing eve s past actions . for similar reasons ,",
    "revealing @xmath16 to eve at step @xmath17 has exactly the same consequences as revealing @xmath18 ; henceforth , we consider the causal disclosure to be @xmath18",
    ". a more general version of the game would allow for distortion in bob s estimate ( see @xcite ) , but in this work we focus on lossless communication .    in the next two definitions ,",
    "refer to figure [ source_channel_fig ] for an illustration of the setup .    for blocklength @xmath9 ,",
    "a source - channel code consists of an encoder @xmath19 and a decoder @xmath20 :    l f:^n^n p_x^n|s^n + g : ^n^n .",
    "note that we do not restrict the encoder to be deterministic .    for any source - channel code",
    ", we can calculate the probability of block error and the payoff earned against the worst - case adversary , as defined in the following :    fix a value function ( or , distortion measure ) @xmath21 .",

    "however , the result can be strengthened considerably by taking into account eve s equivocation of the public message .",
    "the source - channel code used to achieve theorem  [ innerbnd ] remains the same ; only the analysis is strengthened .",

    "<S> the communication system consists of a source and a broadcast ( wiretap ) channel , and lossless reproduction of the source sequence at the legitimate receiver is required . </S>",
    "<S> a key aspect of this model is that the eavesdropper s actions are allowed to depend on the past behavior of the system . </S>",
    "<S> achievability results are obtained by studying the performance of source and channel coding operations separately , and then linking them together digitally . </S>",
    "<S> although the problem addressed here has been solved when the secrecy resource is shared secret key , it is found that substituting secret key for a wiretap channel brings new insights and challenges : the notion of weak secrecy provides just as much distortion at the eavesdropper as strong secrecy , and revealing public messages freely is detrimental . </S>"
