    "mrk 493 , a narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nls1 ) , has a strong fe ii emission .",
    "it was shown by boroson & green ( 1992 ) that a strong anticorrelation between the strengths of the @xmath1}$ ] and fe ii exists in the optical spectra , with nls1 as a class showing the strongest fe ii and weakest @xmath2}$ ] emission .",
    "the observed line widths and absence of forbidden emission suggests that fe ii is formed in the dense broad - line region ( blr ) , but photoionization models can not account for all of the fe ii emission .",
    "the fe ii discrepancy remains unsolved , though models which consider non - radiative heating , with an overabundance of iron are promising ( see paper of joly in this proceedings ) .",
    "we performed 3d spectroscopic observations of mrk 493 in order ( i ) to find the structure of the fe  ii emitting region and possible connection with other emitting regions and ( ii ) to map the circum - nuclear emitting gas .",
    "mrk 493 was observe in august 2002 and may 2004 with the integral - field multipupil fiber spectrograph ( mpfs ) , mounted at the primary focus of the sao ras 6-m telescope ( afanasiev et al . , 2004 ) .",
    "the mpfs takes simultaneous spectra from 256 spatial elements that collects an area of @xmath3 on the sky ( see full description at http://www.sao.ru/hq/lsfvo/devices.html ) .",
    "the spectral interval was @xmath4 with resolution of 7 - 8   ( in 2002 ) and @xmath5 with resolution of 4.5 ( in 2004 ) .",
    "by analyzing of the 3d spectroscopical observations :          we fitted the fe ii and h@xmath8 lines in nucleus region in order to compare the kinematic parameters of the balmer and fe ii line emitting regions .",
    "we found that the broad h@xmath8 can be decomposed into two components ( broad  w@xmath9 and intermediate ",
    "w@xmath10 ) indicating the random velocity of emitting gas around w@xmath112400 km / s and w@xmath12600 km / s . on the other hand ,",
    "the widths of fe ii lines indicate the velocity gas in the fe ii emission region around w@xmath13800 km / s , that is closer to the intermediate region .",
    "this indicates that fe ii lines originate in an intermediate line region as it was mentioned in popovi et al .",
