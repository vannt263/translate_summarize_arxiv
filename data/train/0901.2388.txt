    "the generation of magnetic field by velocity shear and the field s subsequent evolution are of great importance to an understanding of the operation of the solar dynamo .",
    "while the current dynamo paradigm contains many complex interacting components ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , an integral part of all current large - scale solar dynamo models is the creation of strong toroidal magnetic structures in the tachocline , the sun s thin region of strong radial differential rotation separating the latitudinally differentially rotating convection zone and the solid - body - rotating radiative interior .",
    "strong toroidal magnetic field is thought to be induced by the stretching action of the differential rotation on any background poloidal field ( the @xmath0-effect of mean - field dynamo theory ; @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , magnetic buoyancy instabilities @xcite of the generated field are invoked as the mechanism for the creation of distinct magnetic structures and their subsequent rise toward eventual emergence at the solar surface as active regions .    in recent papers , @xcite ( hereinafter vb1 , vb2 )",
    "show that , when naively using the commonly accepted paradigm for the @xmath0-effect , it is surprisingly difficult to initiate magnetic buoyancy instabilities if thermodynamic adjustments are assumed to be adiabatic .",
    "specifically , they concluded from analytic ( vb2 ) and numeric ( vb1 ) calculations that for magnetic buoyancy instabilities to operate in a thin tachocline , the velocity shear flow imposed to drive the system must be necessarily hydrodynamically unstable . roughly speaking",
    ", vb2 found that @xmath1 is required for magnetic buoyancy , where @xmath2 is the richardson number , @xmath3 is the vertical shear width and @xmath4 is the local pressure scale height . for the solar tachocline ,",
    "the estimated richardson number is very large ( @xmath5@xmath6 ) but the region is thin so that @xmath7 @xcite and so the above condition for instability is therefore unlikely to be satisfied .",
    "the simulations of vb1 confirmed numerically that hydrodynamically unstable imposed shear flows could generate magnetic buoyancy instabilities in a thin shear region , but stable shear flows did not .",
    "energetically , this can be thought of as the following conundrum ; for magnetic buoyancy to occur , the shear flow must transfer enough energy into a toroidal magnetic field for it to overcome the stable background stratification .",
    "if the shear can only build ( through an alfvnic process ) magnetic field to the level of equipartition with the flow , and the shear is constrained by the stratification ( since it is hydrodynamically stable ) , then it is difficult for the shear - induced magnetic field to overcome the constraints of the stratification .",
    "it is the case , however , that near the bottom of the convection zone the ratio between the magnetic and thermal diffusivities , @xmath8 , is very small .",
    "it has long been recognized @xcite that , in such circumstances , instabilities can occur that rely on the much greater diffusion rate of the stabilizing thermal component ( see @xcite for further discussions ) .",
    "further , vb2 noted that instability might be enhanced by double - diffusive effects .",
    "assuming isothermal ( as opposed to adiabatic ) adjustments vb2 obtained the much less stringent requirement that @xmath9 .",
    "it is therefore possible that a more - solar - like ( high @xmath2 ) shear - generated magnetic field can become buoyantly unstable in a double - diffusive manner when @xmath10 .    in this letter",
    ", we consider this possibility in a convectively stable atmosphere .",
    "we show that if @xmath11 is sufficiently small , and the background alfvnic timescales are sufficiently slow , then double - diffusive instabilities can exist for parameters that are relevant to the solar interior .",
    "we consider a cartesian domain @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is depth , @xmath14 is the toroidal / zonal direction , and @xmath15 are the poloidal directions .",
    "our system consists of an initially vertical uniform magnetic field , @xmath16 , permeating a stratified layer of compressible fluid under the influence of a forcing designed to generate a target shear flow @xmath17 .",
    "this system is similar to that described in vb1 and in @xcite .",
    "we solve standard non - dimensionalized equations for forced compressible magnetohydrodynamics governing the evolution of velocity @xmath18 , magnetic field @xmath19 , density @xmath20 , temperature @xmath21 , and pressure @xmath22 based around a polytropic atmosphere , @xmath23 .",
    "the non - dimensionalization uses @xmath24 , the temperature at the top of the domain , @xmath25 which is proportional to the total mass within the domain , @xmath26 , the fiducial pressure ( given the specific heat capacities , @xmath27 ) , @xmath16 , the imposed background magnetic field strength , the layer depth @xmath28 , and time units of @xmath29 . we impose stress - free velocity and vertical magnetic field boundary conditions at @xmath30 together with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the horizontal directions are periodic .",
    "the system is solved in a domain with aspect ratio 2:1:1 in a similar manner to that in vb1 and in @xcite at a resolution of ( roughly ) @xmath33 .",
    "this aspect ratio is specified to allow for certain expected dynamics , e.g. we anticipate three - dimensional modes to have smaller scales in the @xmath34 and @xmath13 directions than in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "the thinness of the forced shear region compared to the local scale height is the geometrical factor that identifies the model with the tachocline .",
    "the kinetic and magnetic reynolds numbers for our calculations are roughly @xmath35 , @xmath36 , respectively ( based on the forced shear magnitude and width ) .",
    "estimates of the numerical degrees of freedom @xcite imply that our resolution is reasonable .",
    "however , we further satisfied ourselves that the results were consistent at varying resolutions .",
    "the important parameters in the problem are the dimensionless thermal diffusivity , @xmath37 , the prandtl number @xmath38 ( @xmath39 representing dynamic viscosity ) , the inverse roberts number @xmath40 , and @xmath41 which gives a measure of the alfvn speed along the background field in terms of the fundamental acoustic velocity scale .",
    "note that @xmath11 is the critical parameter governing double - diffusive instability @xcite .    we add a forcing term , @xmath42 , in the @xmath14-momentum equation that would ( in the absence of magnetic effects and instabilities ) maintain a desired target velocity @xmath17 against viscous decay .",
    "we choose @xmath43\\ ] ] to mimic the smooth radial shear transition believed to exist in the solar tachocline .",
    "the width is chosen sufficiently narrow that @xmath44 ( to within numerical precision ) at the boundaries .",
    "an important derived parameter is the richardson number , @xmath45^{2}}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46^{1/2}$ ] is the local brunt - visl frequency of the stable background atmosphere , @xmath47 is the local turnover rate of the background shear and @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath2 measures the relative tendency of a shear flow to overturn fluid vertically compared to gravity s tendency to restore it to its original position .",
    "a large @xmath2 implies that gravity is strongly stabilizing whereas a small value can mean that shear instabilities are possible @xcite .",
    "the goal in this work is to obtain a magnetic buoyancy instability at _ high _ richardson number , a result not found in vb1 , but here we investigate the low @xmath11 regime where the effects of thermal stability are severely reduced .",
    "while the richardson number provides a useful rough measure of the stability properties of our system , we also define the respective thermal and magnetic rayleigh numbers @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "these definitions are consistent with those given in @xcite except that here the magnetic rayleigh number , @xmath52 , is given in a form that anticipates three - dimensional instabilities @xcite .",
    "for the direct ( non - oscillatory ) type of instability , of interest here , both rayleigh numbers are negative , and this corresponds to a thermal stratification that is stabilizing and magnetic gradient that is destabilizing .",
    "a rayleigh number based on the total density stratification would correspond to @xmath53 .",
    "the key result of vb2 , derived under the adiabatic thermal adjustment assumption , is equivalent to saying that @xmath54 is always negative ( ostensibly stable ) unless @xmath55 . in the double - diffusive context , where thermal adjustments are closer to isothermal , the critical parameter is actually @xmath56 , where @xmath10 .",
    "it is @xmath57 that is relevant to the stability of our system and it can potentially become positive even if @xmath58 .",
    "this is equivalent to the isothermal result derived in vb2 that required @xmath9 .    for the basic thermal parameters ( see table  [ parameters ] ) , we take the polytropic index @xmath59 that enforces a convectively stable background polytropic stratification , and a non - dimensional lower - boundary heat flux of @xmath60 . with the chosen shear flow ,",
    "this produced a minimum richardson number of @xmath61 .",
    "while this value is significantly lower than we expect for the solar tachocline , it is high enough to guarantee that @xmath62 hydrodynamically stable .",
    "this fact was checked numerically with a purely hydrodynamic run .    in order to see if double - diffusive instabilities can exist , we ran two simulations that differ _ only _ in the thermal diffusivity @xmath63 ( varied through its non - dimensional counterpart @xmath64 ) .",
    "thus @xmath11 and @xmath65 are varied commensurately to maintain fixed viscous and magnetic diffusivities @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we keep @xmath68 and @xmath69 for all our cases . for our first case , c1 , anticipating instability",
    ", we choose @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in our second case , c2 , anticipating stability , we choose @xmath73 , @xmath74and @xmath75 .",
    "thus , @xmath11 in c1 is 20-fold smaller than in c2 .    the parameter @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is the chandrasekhar number measuring the ratio of magnetic and diffusive timescales ) sets the background vertical magnetic field strength . for c1 and c2",
    "we set @xmath78 .",
    "we desire @xmath79 so that alfvn timescales are slow compared to the acoustic timescale , and @xmath80 so that alfvn timescales are fast compared to diffusion .",
    "c1 and c2 have @xmath81 .",
    "it turns out that the alfvn timescale of the background magnetic field has important consequences for the _ dynamic _ stability of our evolving mhd configuration . to investigate this aspect , we therefore present a third case , c3",
    ", that is identical to c1 except that @xmath82 , ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "c3 therefore has two - fold faster alfvn timescales .",
    "in all three simulations , we begin with a purely vertical magnetic field , and allow the induction of a toroidal field layer by the action of the imposed velocity forcing . in the absence of two- and three - dimensional effects , this induction process is governed by a one - dimensional ( mean ) set of mhd equations : @xmath84 strictly speaking , the density profile in equation  ( [ 1d - u ] ) will evolve along with the shear flow and magnetic field .",
    "however , unlike the work in vb1 - 2 and @xcite , the target shear flow here , @xmath62 , has a _ large _",
    "richardson number . to an excellent approximation",
    ", the background density maintains its initial polytropic profile @xmath85 in this initial phase .",
    "the evolution , as shown in figure  [ mean - bx ] , of the mean toroidal magnetic field is therefore essentially independent of the thermal properties of the system , unless two- or three - dimensional instabilities occur .",
    "as time progresses , the peak field grows in the region of maximum forced velocity shear , and the field gradients strengthen .",
    "the ultimate question is whether a weak shear ( @xmath86 ) can induce strong enough gradients for a magnetic buoyancy instability to occur .",
    "below , we show that two initially identically evolving one - dimensional mhd configurations can have completely different stability properties , based solely on the magnitude of the thermal diffusivity .    in c1 ,",
    "the system does indeed initially evolve according to equations  ( [ 1d - u ] )  and  ( [ 1d - bx ] ) .",
    "however , since @xmath70 is small enough , the induction of mean toroidal field only proceeds for a finite time before an instability becomes apparent at @xmath87 .",
    "figure  ( [ volumes ] ) shows volume - rendered images at this time of the vertical velocity @xmath88 and the fluctuating toroidal magnetic field @xmath89 . in the initial induction phase ( governed by equations  ( [ 1d - u ] )  and  ( [ 1d - bx ] ) ) both these quantities are zero .",
    "however , figure  ( [ volumes ] ) clearly shows that a wave - like perturbation in the vertical velocity and toroidal field has appeared in the region of strong toroidal magnetic field gradients near the top of the evolving toroidal magnetic layer .",
    "the instability appears in a quasi - two - dimensional manner with a wavevector primarily in the @xmath90 plane , taking a form that is similar to a classical ` interchange ' instability @xcite .",
    "roll - like motions principally swap lines of toroidal magnetic field that pierce @xmath90 planes without a large degree of bending along the toroidal @xmath14-direction .",
    "there is a high degree of correlation between vertical velocity and toroidal field perturbations , strongly implying a buoyancy - driven instability ( also see figure  [ flux - correlation ] ) .",
    "we now compare c2 results with those of c1 , which differs only the value of @xmath11 .",
    "we estimate the value of @xmath11 for c2 to be sufficiently large to render @xmath57 everywhere negative , and therefore anticipate that the instability found in c1 , if double - diffusive , should not appear in this case .",
    "we run c2 for over twice the time that it takes for the instability in c1 to manifest ( up to @xmath91 ) and the system simply continues to evolve according to the mean equations  ( [ 1d - u ] )  and  ( [ 1d - bx ] ) .",
    "eventually , these dynamics are benignly disrupted by alfvnic processes without any buoyancy instabilities ( as explained in vb2 ) and we therefore halt the computation . we conclude that the instability discovered in c1 is of a double - diffusive nature , since it depends critically on a sufficiently large thermal diffusivity ( small @xmath11 ) .",
    "a subtle issue in this problem is the influence of the strength of the imposed background field .",
    "as argued in vb1 - 2 , this essentially provides a timescale for disruptive alfvnic processes . for instability to occur ,",
    "the necessary conditions must be met before alfvnic processes can disrupt the source . in vb1 - 2 , this required a _",
    "strong _ velocity shear ( hydrodynamically unstable , @xmath92 ) in order to induce the required magnetic gradients sufficiently quickly for a regular ( mean - density - deficit driven ) magnetic buoyancy instability to occur .",
    "things are more complex in the high @xmath2 , double - diffusive regime considered here . to elucidate this issue , we examine case c3 where the imposed background field strength is twice that of c1 and c2 .",
    "figure  ( [ flux - correlation ] ) shows a vertical profile of the mean vertical transport of @xmath93 for both c1 and c3 , a good indicator of the existence and efficiency of any magnetic buoyancy instabilities .",
    "the measure plotted is @xmath94 where the overline represents a horizontal average , and @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "for ease of comparisons , the normalization factor in the denominator for all cases is that value calculated for c1 and @xmath97 is rescaled to the same units .",
    "figure  ( [ flux - correlation ] ) shows that the toroidal magnetic field perturbations correlate well with vertical velocity perturbations , confirming that the instabilities are most likely of a magnetic buoyancy type .",
    "however , the dotted curve in this figure shows that the transport is significantly weaker for c3 in the initial stages of the instability .",
    "this is a signature of the dynamic nature of the instability .",
    "owing to the evolving background state , @xmath57 does not entirely determine stability .",
    "in the equilibrium stability problem for quasi - incompressible motion without an imposed shear considered in @xcite , the growth rate of the instability becomes positive when @xmath98 . in the current problem , the portion of the domain that is unstable is perpetually moving as the magnetic layer evolves .",
    "therefore , a locally unstable perturbation may not have enough time to amplify to a dynamically significant magnitude before it finds itself outside of the moving region of instability .",
    "only if the growth rate of the instability is sufficiently large can an unstable mode amplify fast enough that the background appears effectively steady .",
    "therefore , to exhibit instability in this evolving system unambiguously , the growth rate of the instability must be at least of the order of the alfvnic evolution timescale for the background , @xmath99 where , @xmath100 is the maximal growth rate as a function of the rayleigh numbers as given in @xcite , and the chandrasekhar number @xmath80 .",
    "equation  ( [ growth - rate ] ) implies that in the presence of a stronger background field , the instability requires a faster growth rate to proceed in the same manner . even though c3 has the exact same background @xmath101 configuration as that for c1 , the stronger background field strength , @xmath16 , alters the nature of the instability . at the location where c1 grows strongly",
    ", c3 only reaches small amplitude ( albeit in a shorter time : @xmath102 _",
    "cf_.  @xmath87 ) .",
    "however , the instability in c3 can still grow to significant amplitudes _ higher up _ in the domain as the system evolves further , as shown by the dashed curve in figure  ( [ flux - correlation ] ) . the amplitude is further modified since the stable background density stratification , and therefore @xmath57 changes slightly with height .",
    "we have demonstrated that the presence of shear - generated double - diffusive magnetic buoyancy instabilities can be controlled primarily by the single parameter @xmath11 .",
    "given the dynamic nature of the instability here , the second most important parameter is the chandresekhar number , @xmath77 , which dictates the background alfvnic timescales .",
    "c3 provides good evidence that the efficiency of the instability is governed through a relation at least qualitatively similar to equation  ( [ growth - rate ] ) .",
    "however , the question remains as to whether any other parameters , such as the magnetic prandtl number , @xmath103 , are critical to this process .",
    "numerical constraints restrict our simulations to @xmath104 , which is less than unity thus preserving the correct ordering of timescales , but larger than the estimated solar value of @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "to make some progress , we extend the analysis of @xcite , noting again that this discusses the double - diffusive instabilites of an equilibrium rather than a dynamically - evolving system . it can be shown that equation  ( [ growth - rate ] ) embodies the solution to a @xmath106-order polynomial in @xmath107 . in the limit @xmath108 and @xmath109",
    "this can be simplified to a cubic polynomial depending solely on the reduced variables @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 : @xmath113 where @xmath114 figure  ( [ critical - parameter ] ) shows the resulting dependence of the critical value of @xmath115 versus @xmath116 for several values of @xmath112 .",
    "in particular , it can be seen that the instability is more easily obtained for smaller @xmath112 , which makes sense in terms of the lessening relative importance of viscosity , and , encouragingly , supports the viability of this process at more realistic solar parameters .",
    "the transport measure @xmath117 has a more complicated dependence on @xmath112 . in the appropriate rayleigh number regime , @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the horizontal wavenumber of the fastest growing mode .",
    "as @xmath112 is decreased , @xmath119 decreases and @xmath107 increases , and hence the dependence on @xmath112 is not straightforward .",
    "however , in the limit as @xmath120 , then @xmath121 , which , from figure  ( [ critical - parameter ] ) , is nonzero even at @xmath122 .",
    "this argument implies that , if we were able to run a computation at a significantly lower value of @xmath112 than in c1 and c3 ( an extreme numerical challenge given our other parameters ) , we might expect that the buoyant transport should decrease , but not disappear altogether .",
    "after the pessimistic results of vb1 - 2 , it is encouraging that when double - diffusive effects are taken into account , the dynamics intuitively expected in the tachocline appear to be possible , satisfying the constraints that we have anticipated . we know",
    "roughly that @xmath123 and @xmath124 in the tachocline , and it is therefore plausible that their product is smaller than @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "however , we know very little about the configuration of any magnetic field in the solar tachocline or the associated alfvnic timescales , and hence we do not know exactly _ how much _",
    "smaller @xmath11 must be for the growth rate of an instability to become large enough for it to proceed .    even if instability occurs , it still remains unclear whether the nonlinear evolution of the system can produce magnetic fields that are sufficiently strong and coherent to be able to rise through the turbulent convection zone .",
    "while it now seems possible that high @xmath2 shear flows could produce buoyant magnetic structures in the tachocline , one might expect that such buoyant structures would have magnetic energies that are ( at most ) in equipartition with the shear .",
    "if the turbulent convection zone acts locally in maintaining the tachocline s shear , then it is difficult to see how magnetic structures could obtain the significantly greater strengths that are required to survive the disrupting effects of the convection zone @xcite .",
    "of course , this question depends critically on how the energy of the shear relates to that of the convection zone , which is not well understood .",
