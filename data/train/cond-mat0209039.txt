    "the swiftly developing field of spin electronics@xcite has provided strong motivation towards the construction of novel magnetic materials . of particular interest",
    "are half - metals , _ i.e. _  compounds for which only the one spin direction presents a gap at the fermi level @xmath1 , while the other has a metallic character .",
    "such behavior is present in various perovskite structures,@xcite in heusler compounds,@xcite and in dilute magnetic semiconductors.@xcite lately it has been possible to grow binary cras in the zinc - blende ( z - b ) structure epitaxially on gaas ; this compound was found to be half metallic , both by experiment and by relevant calculations.@xcite it has also the great advantage of a high curie temperature @xmath2 , around 400  k.@xcite similar is the @xmath2 of ferromagnetic z - b crsb.@xcite moreover , the growth of nanoscale z - b mnas dots on gaas substrates@xcite has been achieved and cras / gaas multilayers have been fabricated.@xcite evidently , the know - how on the construction of these materials , which perhaps can be viewed as the limiting cases of dilute magnetic semiconductors , is increasing , and they will possibly be at the center of interest of spintronics applications soon , since they combine half - metallicity , high curie temperature , and coherent growth on semiconductor ( sc ) substrates .",
    "the experimental work on these systems seems to lie ahead of the theoretical analysis .",
    "pioneering calculations concerning the bulk or the surfaces have been reported,@xcite but there is still extensive work to be done . one matter to be discussed",
    "is the origin of the half - metallicity ; another is the question whether half - metallicity is preserved at the surfaces ; and a third , in view of the future possible growth of similar compounds based on different sc or transition metals , is the theoretical prediction of the cases where half - metallicity can manifest itself , in order to serve as a helpful guideline to where future experiments can focus .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to address these three points by first - principles calculations .",
    "the outline of the paper has as follows . in section  [ sec : calc ]",
    "we briefly describe our method of calculation . in section  [ sec : es ] we address the question of the origin of the half - metallic behavior and discuss the electronic structure of the z - b compounds of transiton elements with @xmath0 atoms ; we examine only the ferromagnetic configuration in view of the conclusions of shirai@xcite on vas , cras , and mnas . in section",
    "[ sec : trends ] we present the results of extensive systematic calculations for the z - b compounds of the form xy , with x = v , cr , mn , and y = n , p , as , sb , s , se , te , for various lattice constants in a ferromagnetic configuration , and we examine in which cases half - metallicity is present ; we also present the calculated equilibrium lattice constants to obtain a feeling for the lattice mismatch if one would grow these compounds on semiconductors . in section  [ sec : surf ]",
    "we focus on the half - metallicity of transition metal terminated ( 001 ) surfaces .",
    "we conclude with a summary in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "to perform the calculations , we have used the vosko , wilk and nusair parameterization@xcite for the local density approximation ( lda ) of the exchange - correlation potential to solve the kohn - sham equations within the full - potential screened korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green function method,@xcite where the correct shape of the wigner - seitz cells is accounted for.@xcite the scalar relativistic approximation was used , which takes into account the relativistic effects except that of spin - orbit coupling.@xcite to calculate the charge density , we integrate along a contour on the complex energy plane , which extends from below the @xmath3 states of the @xmath0 atom up to the fermi level , using 42 energy points . for the brillouin zone ( bz ) integration we have used a @xmath4-space grid of 30@xmath530@xmath530 in the full bz ( 752 @xmath4-points in the irreducible wedge ) for the bulk calculations and a @xmath6-space grid 30@xmath530 ( 256 @xmath6-points in the irreducible wedge ) in the two - dimensional full bz for the surface calculations .",
    "we have used a cutoff of @xmath7 for the wavefuctions and green functions .",
    "more details on the surface calculations are described in ref .  .",
    "the z - b structure can be easily seen to fit on a bcc lattice , by occupying only half of the sites with the two kinds of atoms and leaving the other half as voids .",
    "viewed in this way , the consecutive lattice sites of bcc in the cubic diagonal are occupied by ga , as , void1 , void2 ( in the case of _",
    "e.g. _  gaas ) .",
    "this is useful for the kkr method because all empty space of the quite open z - b structure is taken into account .",
    "we must also say a few words about state - counting with the kkr method .",
    "the charge is found by adding the partial contributions of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 electrons ( if a cutoff of @xmath7 is used ) . in this way",
    "one ignores the contribution to the wavefunction of higher angular momenta , which , although very small , is nonzero .",
    "this has a negligible effect for calculations in a metal , where the missing ( or extra ) charge is regained by a very small readjustment of the fermi level @xmath1 .",
    "however , if there is a band gap at @xmath1 , one finds the charge to deviate slightly from the integer value it should have by state - counting . as a consequence for half metals , altough the densitiy of states ( dos ) and the inspection of the bands show clearly that @xmath1 lies within the gap for minority spin , and hence the magnetic moment per unit cell must be integer , its calculated value deviates slightly from the exact integer value . in our work , the presence of half metallicity has always been judged by inspection of the density of states and of the energy bands , and not from the value of the magnetic moment .",
    "the partial values of the charges and moments , calculated by local orbital summation , are accurate to within 1% .",
    "in this section we shall examine the electronic structure of the compounds , and discuss the origin of the half metallicity and the value of the total moment .",
    "although for arbitrary @xmath4 the wavefunctions do not belong exclusively to a single irreducible representation such as @xmath12 or @xmath13 , it is convenient to retain this terminology for the bands formed by originally @xmath12 or @xmath13 orbitals since they are energetically rather separated",
    ". let us focus on a @xmath14 atom . in the z - b structure ,",
    "the tetrahedral environment allows its @xmath12 states ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) to hybridize with the @xmath9 states of the four first neighbors ( the @xmath0 atoms ) .",
    "note that in the tetrahedral geometry , the @xmath9 orbitals of the four neighboring sites transform as partners of the @xmath12 irreducible representation when analyzed around the central site .",
    "] this creates a large bonding - antibonding splitting , with the low - lying bonding states being more of @xmath9 character around the @xmath0 neighbors ( we call these bands `` @xmath9-bands '' henceforth ) , and the antibonding being rather of @xmath10 character around the @xmath14 atom ( but see also the discussion below concerning refs .   and ) .",
    "the gap formed in between is partly filled by the @xmath13 states of the @xmath14 atom ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) ; the position of the gap will be different for majority and minority electrons , due to the exchange splitting .",
    "this symmetry - induced @xmath9-@xmath10 hybridization and bonding - antibonding splitting has been found in the past in the case of transiton metal doped zinc - blende semiconductors;@xcite the splitting has also been refered to as `` @xmath9-@xmath10 repulsion '' , concerning the interaction of the impurity @xmath12 localized states with the semiconductor anion @xmath9 band . in the limit of full substitution of the semiconductor cation by the transition metal ,",
    "one arrives to the cases studied here ; in particular mnte has been studied in ref .  , and has been found half - metallic if the ferromagnetic phase is assumed .",
    "the situation can be elucidated by examination of the energy bands of cras , presented in fig .",
    "the @xmath8 states of as are very low in energy and omitted in the figure . around @xmath20 , the @xmath9-bands can be seen .",
    "the next bands are the ones formed by the cr @xmath13 orbitals , around @xmath21 for majority and @xmath22 for minority .",
    "they are quite flat , reflecting the fact that their hybridization with the states of as neighbors is weak ( or even zero , at @xmath23 , due to symmetry ) .",
    "these bands can accommodate two electrons per spin . above them ,",
    "the substantially wider antibonding @xmath9-@xmath12 hybrids appear , starting from @xmath24 for majority and from @xmath25 for minority .",
    "their large bandwidth can be attributed to the strong hybridization and to their high energy position .",
    "the bonding - antibonding splitting is also contributing to the fact that they be pushed up beyond the flat @xmath13 states . as a result ,",
    "the three families of bands do not intermix , but are rather energetically separate . in the majority - spin direction",
    "the bonding - antibonding splitting is smaller , because the transition element @xmath14 states are originally lower in energy , closer to the @xmath9 states of the @xmath0 atom . in the minority spin direction",
    "the states are higher due to the exchange splitting and the gap is around @xmath1 .",
    "band counting gives an integer total magnetic moment of 3 @xmath26 .    to the clear bonding - antibonding gap",
    "also the z - b geometry contributes , since it has been previously reported@xcite that in the hexagonal nias geometry mnp , mnas and mnsb show no gap .    here",
    "we must refer to two recent publications on zinc - blende mnas@xcite , and mnp , mnas , and mnsb,@xcite which have identified the @xmath9 and @xmath12 bands the other way around ; _",
    "i.e. _  they state that the bonding bands are more of @xmath10-character around mn and the antibonding more of @xmath9 character around the @xmath0 atom .",
    "this is correct for the majority bands in those compounds where the majority transition - element @xmath10 states are originally lower than the anion @xmath9 states , _ e.g. _  in the case of the mnas or cras bonding majority bands . for minority - spin",
    "the situation is the other way around , so that the bonding bands are more @xmath9-like centered around the @xmath0 cation , while the antibonding bands are more @xmath10-like centered around the transition element .",
    "this can be seen by the atom - resolved dos in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for the group - vi compounds ,",
    "the @xmath9 states are initially even lower , so that the @xmath9 character of the bonding states increases for both spins .",
    ", @xmath13 , and @xmath12 we denote the whole bands originating from orbitals of the corresponding character , although this character is well defined only for @xmath23 .",
    "the bonding - antibonding splitting between the @xmath9 and @xmath12 bands is evident ; the band gap is between the @xmath9 and the flat @xmath13 bands .",
    "the system is half - metallic . ]",
    "the small dos of the vacant sites is omitted . in all cases",
    ", @xmath1 lies within the minority - spin gap , _",
    "i.e. _  the systems are half - metallic . in the upper left inset",
    ", the majority dos for vas is shown in more detail around @xmath1 , to demonstrate the low dos at @xmath1 .",
    "spin moments for these compounds are given in table  .",
    "]    next we consider different compounds , to see the trend of increasing transition metal atomic number : vas , cras , mnas .",
    "the corresponding dos can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , calculated for the inas lattice parameter in all cases to allow comparison . for vas , @xmath1 lies between the majority @xmath13 and @xmath12 . since they are separated , this results in zero dos at @xmath1 , as in the limiting case of a semiconductor with almost zero band gap ( shown in more detail in the corresponding inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the moment is @xmath27 . as the number of valence @xmath14 electrons increases for cras ,",
    "the @xmath12 bands are pulled down enough to accommodate one electron ( @xmath28 ) , and for mnas even more , so as to accommodate two electrons , whence @xmath29 . at the same time , for the minority spin the band gap does not change in magnitude and continues to embrace @xmath1 .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the exchange splitting @xmath30 being proportional to the magnetic moment : @xmath31 .",
    "when the moment increases by 1 @xmath26 , @xmath30 must increase by one time the exchange integral @xmath32 , about @xmath33.@xcite thus the minority bands remain almost at their position .",
    "this behavior is quite stable , unless the energy gained by increasing the exchange splitting in order to achieve one more @xmath26 is overshot by the coulomb energy cost ; remember that the majority @xmath12 bands are wide .",
    "then the system compromises by placing @xmath1 higher , within the minority @xmath13 conduction band , and half metallicity is lost .",
    "this can occur for small lattice constants or at the surface , and will be presented in the next sections .    generally , the bonding @xmath9 bands can accommodate 6 electrons ( 3 per spin ) , and since they lie low in energy they must be filled up ; in addition , there is yet another band lower in energy , consisting of the @xmath8 states of the @xmath0 atom , which has space for two electrons ( one per spin ) .",
    "once these 8 bands are filled by 8 of the valence electrons , the remaining electrons will fill part of majority @xmath10 states , first the lower - lying @xmath13 and then the @xmath12 , creating the magnetic moment .",
    "this electron counting gives then an integer total moment of @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total number of valence electrons in the unit cell .",
    ", where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the numbers of majority and minority valence electrons .",
    "] this `` rule of 8 '' is the analogue of the slater - pauling behavior for these systems ; similar behavior is found in the case of the half - metallic heusler alloys , as a `` rule of 18 '' or a `` rule of 24''.@xcite of course these are valid only when half - metallicity is present .    according to the `` rule of 8 '' of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sp ] ) , the ( integer ) moment should increase by @xmath38 if one changes only the @xmath0 atom from group v to group vi , since then one more valence electron is available ( in this respect there is a similarity to the dilute magnetic semiconductors@xcite ) . in order to present this , we calculated the electronic structure of the @xmath14group vi compounds . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the dos of crs , crse , and crte are shown .",
    "we chose to use the inas lattice constant in this case , so as to compare with the group v compounds at a single lattice constant .",
    "note that the inas lattice ( 6.058 ) is very close to the cdse one ( 6.052 ) .",
    "we found a ferromagnetic half - metallic solution for these cases , with a magnetic moment of 4 @xmath26 as expected .",
    "the physical mechanism involved is the same as in the @xmath14group v case , and the main difference lies in that @xmath9 states of the group vi elements lie lower in energy , so that the band gap is larger and the hybridization with the neighbor @xmath10 states smaller",
    ".    we have also calculated the @xmath14group vi compounds vs , vse , vte , mns , mnse , and mnte .",
    "they also show half - metallic behavior for a range of lattice constants , with their magnetic moment given by the `` rule of 8 '' ; they will be discussed in the next section .",
    "however , we must note that we have only searched for the ferromagnetic solution .",
    "a systematic investigation of the energetics of ferromagnetic _ vs. _",
    "antiferromagnetic solutions lies beyond the scope of this paper . especially in the case of mn ",
    "group vi compounds , an antiferromagnetic solution could be possibly more stable , since these compounds are isoelectronic with feas , which has been found to have an antiferromagnetic ground state at the equilibrium lattice constant in calculations by shirai;@xcite especially mnte has been calculated to be more stable in the antifferomagnetic phase , in ref .  .",
    "for the compounds vas , cras , and mnas , the analysis of shirai points towards stable ferromagnetic solutions .",

    "again we see the loss of half - metallicity by compression , and a stronger tendency towards half - metallicity for lighter group vi elements ; both effects can be attributed to the same reasons as in the @xmath14group v case .",
    "however , the calculated equilibrium lattice constants ( given in parentheses in tables  [ table:1 ] and [ table:2 ] ) lessen the possible selections .",
    "indeed , the nitrides and sulphides tend to be so much condensed that they would probably not grow epitaxially at a lattice constant favouring half - metallicity ; the nitrides are even nonmagnetic at their small equilibrium lattice constant .",
    "in fact , only vsb , crsb and crte are half - metallic at their equilibrium lattice constant . on the other hand ,",
    "if one would allow for a 5% expansion due to the lda overbinding or tollerable lattice mismatch , one has the possible combinations vas / gaas , vsb / inas , cras / gaas , crsb / inas , vte / cdte , crse / cds , crte / znte .",
    "other authors have reported results on the equilibrium lattice constant of mnas , cras,@xcite vas,@xcite and crsb.@xcite for mnas , the most frequently studied of these , the reported lda results are : 5.85  (ref .  ) , 5.6 - 5.7  (ref .  ) , 5.45  (ref .  ) , and 5.34  (ref .  ) .",
    "our calculations give 5.36   .",
    "we do not know the reason for the discrepancies among the reported values . changing the @xmath39 cutoff or the number of @xmath4-points brought only very small changes to our result ,",
    "while using non - relativistic treatment for the valence electrons resulted in an increase to 5.41   .",
    "results using the generalised gradient approximation ( gga ) as an improvement to the lda have been reported in refs .  , , and , giving slightly larger lattice constants compared with lda .",
    "in the last part of this paper we examine the possibility of half - metallicity at the surfaces of these compounds .",
    "one of the authors ( ig ) has recently studied the ( 001 ) surface of cras.@xcite the conclusion of that study was that the as terminated surface loses the half - metallicity due to as dangling bonds that form a surface band within the minority spin gap , while the cr terminated surface retains the half - metallic character and the local magnetic moment increases .",
    "this behavior was found for both the gaas and inas lattice constants .",
    "here we have extended our calculations to include the vas and mnas ( 001 ) surfaces , for the inas lattice constant .",
    "the atoms were kept in their ideal bulk - like positions , _ i.e. _ , we have calculated the unrelaxed and unreconstructed surface ; we must note that large relaxations or reconstruction could alter the half - metallic character of the surface .",
    "since for the as terminated surfaces the surface states originating from dangling bonds can not be avoided , we will discuss the termination with the @xmath14 atom .",
    "although at the surface the @xmath12 and @xmath13 representations are no longer relevant ( the former splits in two , one containing @xmath40 and one @xmath15 , and the latter also in two , one containing @xmath19 and one @xmath18 ) , we ask for understanding that we continue to use the same terminology in order to make the connection to the bulk states .    left pannel : spin- and atom - resolved dos of the v - terminated ( 001 ) surface for the v atom at the surface layer and the as atom at the subsurface layer for the inas lattice constant ( left pannel ) .",
    "the surface dos ( full lines ) and the bulk dos ( dashed lines ) are shown .",
    "the as @xmath8 states are located at around 10 ev below the fermi level and are not shown in the figures",
    ". the energy zero refers to @xmath1 ; negative numbers on the dos axis represent the minority spin .",
    "right pannel : same for the mn - terminated mnas ( 001 ) surface . ]    the dos for the vas and mnas ( 001 ) surfaces are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , for both the atom at the surface layer ( v or mn ) and at the subsurface layer ( as ) . for comparison ,",
    "the corresponding dos in the bulk are also presented .",
    "evidently the v terminated vas ( 001 ) surface remains half - metallic .",
    "however , there is an important difference in the dos as compared to the bulk case , especially at the surface ( v ) layer .",
    "for the majority spin , the peak at around @xmath41 is strongly reduced , and the same happens for the minority spin at around @xmath42 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the surface v atom has a reduced coordination number of only two as neighbors .",
    "then two less as @xmath9 orbitals penetrate the v cell , reducing the local weight of the bonding states . at the same time ,",
    "the majority peak just under the fermi level is enhanced , gaining the weight which has been lost by the bonding states from both spin directions .",
    "note in the dos of the v surface atom that there is no more the clear minimum at @xmath1 for the majority states , which was distinguishing @xmath13 from @xmath12 in the bulk , as the reduced bonding - antibonding splitting allows the latter states to come lower in energy .    in terms of electron",
    "counting , the v atoms in the bulk give away 3 of the 5 valence electrons to the @xmath9 band and retain the remaining two to build up the magnetic moment . on the other hand , due to the reduced coordination at the surface",
    ", only 1.5 electron per v atom is given away , thus 3.5 remain to fill up majority states and build up the magnetic moment ; due to the gap , the minority states can not take over any of these extra electrons , unless @xmath1 moves higher into the @xmath13-like band ( this is the case for mn to which we shall turn shortly ) .",
    "the situation is given schematically in fig .",
    "[ figschema ] .     at the vas surface .",
    "the arrows represent the donation of v electrons to the valence band generated mainly by the low - lying as @xmath9 orbitals . at the v - terminated ( 001 ) surface",
    ", half the neighbors of the v atom are missing , so an excess of 1.5 electrons remains .",
    "they occupy the majority - spin states , giving an extra 1.5 @xmath26 .",
    "the situation is similar in all @xmath14-group v compounds ; for the @xmath14-group vi compounds the @xmath9 band welcomes in total 2 instead of 3 electrons from each @xmath14 atom , thus the excess moment is 1 instead of 1.5 @xmath26.,width=302 ]    the gain in magnetic moment at the surface is accompanied by an increase of the exchange splitting , pushing the antibonding and @xmath13-like minority peaks higher in energy ( from 1.5 ev to 2 ev ) ; otherwise the gap could have decreased due to reduced hybridisation .",
    "the increased magnetic moment must reach @xmath43 in the vicinity of the surface ; we find that @xmath44 are located on the surface layer , about @xmath45 in the vacuum , and the rest adds up to the moment of the subsurface layer .",
    "we see that the integer value of the magnetic moment , which is mandatory in bulk half - metallicity , ceases to be a prerequisite in the vicinity of the surface .",
    "the situation described here is completely analogous to the one of the cras ( 001 ) surface.@xcite there , the magnetic moment of the surface layer was reported to reach 4 @xmath26 ; if the magnetic moment of the vacuum and the subsurface layer is added , one finds a total moment of 4.5 @xmath26 in the vicinity of the surface , _ i.e. _ 1.5 @xmath26 more than in the bulk .",
    "however , things are different for mnas ( 001 ) ( with mn termination ) .",
    "the corresponding dos of the surface mn atom and of the subsurface as atom is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( right panel ) .",
    "manifestly , half - metallicity has been lost .",
    "the difference to the vas and cras cases lies in the high magnetic moment of @xmath46 that mnas already shows in the bulk .",
    "if its moment were to increase by the same mechanism , the surface ( plus vacuum and subsurface layers ) would have to accommodate 5.5 majority spin electrons .",
    "this is energetically unfavorable , since the extra half electron can not be accommodated by the @xmath12 band , so that higher - lying bands would have to be populated . instead ,",
    "as the majority states are lowered , the slow gain in magnetic moment is not enough to increase the exchange splitting substantially , and the minority @xmath10 states also reach @xmath1 . as a net result , majority and",
    "minority dos peaks are substantially lower in energy , half - metallicity is lost , and a total magnetic moment of @xmath47 is present within the first surface layer .",
    "spin- and atom - resolved dos of the cr - terminated cras and crse ( 001 ) surfaces for the cr atom at the surface layer and the as and se atoms at the subsurface layer for the inas lattice constant .",
    "the as and se @xmath8 states are located at around 10 ev below the fermi level and are not shown in the figures .",
    "the surface dos are compared to the bulk calculations ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the energy zero refers to @xmath1 ; negative numbers on the dos axis represent the minority spin . ]    we have also made calculations for the x terminated xse(001 ) surfaces , where x = v , cr , and mn , using the inas lattice constant .",
    "the v and cr ones are half - metallic while the mn surface is not half - metallic .",
    "the arguments in the above paragraphs still hold , but now each v , mn or cr atom loses se ( group vi ) neighbors instead of as ( group v ) and thus the electron counting changes . in the bulk each x atom gives away only 2 electrons to the @xmath9 band and not 3 as in the xas compounds .",
    "losing two neighbors means that the surface x atom gives away now only 1 electron , so we should have now 4 electrons for v or 5 electrons for cr to build up the spin moment , _ i.e. _  we should have 1 @xmath26 more than in the bulk .",
    "indeed we find the total spin moment to increase to 4 @xmath26 for vse(001 ) and 5 @xmath26 for crse(001 ) .",
    "the mnse compound can not be half - metallic as this would mean a total spin moment of 6 @xmath26 at the surface which is energetically unfavourable for reasons similar to the mnas surface .",
    "a comparison of the cras(001 ) with the crse(001 ) surface dos , both cr terminated and at the inas lattice constant , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , where the bulk dos is also presented .",
    "we see that the differences in the bulk of the two materials ( larger gap , more weight in the majority states under @xmath1 to account for one more electron ) remain their major differences also in the surfaces .",
    "we have studied zinc - blende compounds of the transition metal elements v , cr , mn with the group v @xmath0 elements n , p , as , sb and the group vi s , se , te , in the ferromagnetic configuration .",
    "they all show a tendency towards half - metallic behavior , _",
    "i.e. _  100% spin polarization at @xmath1 .",
    "this can be traced back to the bonding - antibonding splitting due to hybridization between the transition element @xmath10 ( @xmath12 ) states and the @xmath0 element @xmath9 states , conspiring with the large exchange splitting which pushes up the minority @xmath10 states .",
    "the total moment per unit cell , if the system is half - metallic , is integer and given by the `` rule of 8 '' .",
    "also , the @xmath0 atoms are found to have an antiparallel local moment with respect to the @xmath14 atoms ; the absolute value of the local moments increases for lighter or less ionized @xmath0 elements .",
    "this is traced back to the degree of localization of the @xmath9 wavefunctions around the @xmath0 atoms .",
    "we have discussed the trends with varying lattice constant , in view of the possibility to grow these materials epitaxially on various semiconductors , and calculated the lda equilibrium lattice constants to obtain a feeling of the lattice mismatch with the possible sc substrates .",
    "compression eventually kills half - metallicity , since @xmath1 finally wanders above the minority gap .",
    "although for compounds involving lighter @xmath0 elements half - metallicity is seems more robust , there equilibrium lattice constants are too small .",
    "thus , the best candidates for half - metallicity from this aspect are vas , vsb , cras , crsb , vte , cras , and crte .",
    "finally , we have examined the behavior of the transition element terminated ( 001 ) surfaces . in most cases",
    "half metallicity is maintained , and the magnetic moment increases because of the missing neighbours where charge would be transfered .",
    "exceptions are the cases where the surface magnetic moment should exceed 5 @xmath26 , for which half metallicity is lost .    in view of recent experimental success to grow such compounds , and of their relevance to the field of spintronics , we believe that our work will not only add to the understanding of these systems , but will also contribute to the future realization of spintronics devices .",
