    "however , this interpretation is questionable , because a similar double peak is also present in @xmath0 perpendicular to the chain direction.@xcite for the haldane - chain ( @xmath9 ) system agvp@xmath1s@xmath10 , a magnetic contribution seems to play a role too,@xcite but the absolute values are much smaller than in the @xmath11 systems .",
    "the results in 1d systems raise the question whether a sizeable heat current due to magnetic excitations is also present in two - dimensional magnets .",

    "the thermal conductivity @xmath3 for a heat current along the cuo@xmath1 planes exhibits a pronounced double - peak structure with a low - temperature maximum around 25k and a second one around 250k .",
    "in contrast , the thermal conductivity @xmath17 perpendicular to the cuo@xmath1 planes has only one low - temperature peak.@xcite these findings have been interpreted in terms of an additional heat transport parallel to the cuo@xmath1 planes due to magnetic excitations .",
    "however , a double - peak structure can also be explained by phonons only . any additional scattering mechanism which acts in a narrow temperature range suppresses @xmath0 in that temperature window and as a result @xmath0 may exhibit two peaks .",
    "for example , in srcu@xmath1(bo@xmath8)@xmath1 a double - peak structure is caused by resonant scattering of acoustic phonons by magnetic excitations.@xcite such a mechanism does not apply for la@xmath15cuo@xmath16 .",
    "however , la@xmath15cuo@xmath16 has a structural instability with low - lying optical phonon branches , which could also serve as scatterers for the acoustic phonons .",

    "et al . _ for the heat transport data of ybacuo@xmath18 , which show a similar temperature dependence of @xmath3 as la@xmath1cuo@xmath16.@xcite    recently , we have measured @xmath3 of sr@xmath1cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 in order to investigate the possibility that resonant phonon scattering due to the structural instability may cause the double - peak structure in @xmath3 of la@xmath15cuo@xmath16 . sr@xmath1cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 and la@xmath15cuo@xmath16 are almost isostructural , but sr@xmath1cuo@xmath1cl@xmath1 has no structural instability .",
    "nevertheless we also found a second high - temperature maximum in @xmath3 and took this as evidence for the second peak of the in - plane heat conductivity being caused by magnetic excitations.@xcite basing on this observation we expect that a pronounced magnetic contribution to the thermal conductivity is a common feature of the layered cuprates .",

    "these quantitative differences could arise from the absence or presence of a structural instability and/or weak charge carrier doping in the different samples . in order to investigate whether the high - temperature peak of @xmath3 is indeed an intrinsic feature of the antiferromagnetic cuo@xmath1 planes and to get more insight about the influence of structural changes ,",

    "a common feature of la@xmath15cuo@xmath16 and @xmath23cuo@xmath16 , with @xmath22 , nd , sm , eu , and gd is the layered structure with planes consisting of a cuo@xmath1 square lattice .",

    "it remains , however , to clarify what determines the magnitude of @xmath82 .",
    "for a quantitative analysis we consider the in - plane thermal conductivity as the sum of a phononic and a magnetic contribution @xmath83 which are only weakly coupled to each other . in general , such an ansatz can be used when the characteristic energy scales for the two contributions are well separated from each other . for example",
    ", this is usually the case for electronic and phononic heat transport since the fermi temperature is much larger than the debye temperature , i.e.  @xmath84 . in the case of @xmath19cuo@xmath2",
    "it is a priori not clear whether the assumption of weakly coupled phononic and magnetic contributions is fulfilled , since the magnetic coupling @xmath26 is only about four times as large as @xmath85 ( see table[tabelle ] ) .",
    "however , the experimental observation that @xmath3 shows two characteristic maxima , which are well separated from each other , encourages us to use eq.([kmag ] ) .    in order to separate @xmath7 from @xmath3",
    "we assume that in the region of the low - temperature peak @xmath7 is negligibly small and fit the data for @xmath86k ( gd@xmath15cuo@xmath16 : @xmath87k ) by the debye model ( see eq .",
    "( 1 ) of ref .  ) and subtract the extrapolation of the fit from the measured data up to room temperature , i.e.  @xmath88.@xcite this analysis is not possible for eu@xmath15cuo@xmath16 , because the low - temperature maximum is not well - enough pronounced . however , even without a fit we expect rather similar values of @xmath7 for @xmath77 , sm , and eu , because the high - temperature data of @xmath3 are very similar for these crystals ( see fig.[nd ] ) .",

    "it has been found that sr doping suppresses @xmath92 much stronger than zn doping and @xmath93 vanishes almost completely above about @xmath94% sr .",

    "since it is known that la@xmath1cuo@xmath32 is likely to have some excess oxygen , we plot the maximum of @xmath7 as a function of @xmath95 , which is very sensitive to small amounts of @xmath96 ( inset of fig.[mag ] ) .",
    "the observed correlation between the magnitude of @xmath7 and @xmath31 is a clear indication that the different magnitudes of @xmath7 arise from small amounts of charge carriers in the different crystals.@xcite    one may suspect that the higher values of @xmath7 of @xmath19cuo@xmath16 with @xmath97 and nd from refs .   in comparison to our crystals",

    "the rather low @xmath60k of our pr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 crystal compared to the @xmath31 values up to @xmath98k reported in literature@xcite supports this view .",

    "irrespective of the question of the exact oxygen stoichiometry , our finding that @xmath7 is very similar in crystals with and without structural instabilities leads to the conclusion that scattering by phonons seems to play a minor role for the magnetic heat transport in the cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "this is most clearly seen in eu@xmath1cuo@xmath2 where the phononic low - temperature peak of eu@xmath1cuo@xmath2 is strongly suppressed by a structural instability whereas its magnetic high - temperature maximum is hardly affected .",
    "in summary , we have studied the thermal conductivity of the rare earth cuprates @xmath23cuo@xmath16 for both , a heat current perpendicular ( @xmath20 and gd ) and parallel ( @xmath20 , nd , sm , eu , and gd ) to the cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "the out - of - plane thermal conductivity shows the typical temperature dependence of a purely phononic thermal conductivity with a low - temperature maximum , whose magnitude depends on the crystal quality .",

    "such an anisotropy between the in - plane and the out - of - plane thermal conductivity is also found in la@xmath15cuo@xmath16.@xcite the fact that the double - peak is present in the structurally stable @xmath23cuo@xmath16 with @xmath20 , nd , and sm unambiguously rules out the possibility that the double - peak structure is caused by a structural instability , which is present for @xmath100 , eu , and gd .",
    "the qualitative anisotropy between the in - plane and the out - of - plane thermal conductivity and the rather similar high - temperature behavior of the out - of - plane thermal conductivity for all the different crystals gives clear evidence that this additional high - temperature contribution arises from a sizeable heat transport by magnetic excitations within the cuo@xmath1 planes .",
