    "@xmath2he atoms adsorbed on a graphite surface is known to be an ideal two - dimensional correlated spin-1/2 fermion system .",
    "a solidified commensurate phase of @xmath2he atoms is stabilized at a @xmath3 density of the underlying layer of @xmath4he atoms due to the substrate potential corrugation and thus a triangular lattice of @xmath2he atoms is formed , which is a realization of a gapless quantum spin liquid ( qsl).@xcite theoretically , this @xmath3 phase of spin-1/2 @xmath2he atoms has been studied by using the triangular - lattice heisenberg model with the multiple - spin exchange interactions.@xcite importance of the density fluctuations has recently been pointed out as well.@xcite    a finite amount of vacancies of @xmath2he atoms can be introduced into this @xmath3 phase in a stable manner , where the vacancies can hop from site to site of the triangular lattice via quantum - mechanical tunneling motions even at absolute zero temperature .",
    "the presence of such vacancies , called the zero - point vacancies ( zpvs ) , was predicted a few decays ago.@xcite quite recently , the experimental evidence for the zpvs has been reported in the monolayer of @xmath2he adsorbed on a surface of graphite preplated by a solid monolayer of @xmath4he:@xcite i.e. , heat capacity measurements of the system show an anomalous coexistence of a magnetic round - peak near 1 mk and a broad peak at several tens mk that are associated with the zpvs doped into the commensurate mott - localized solid .",
    "the zpvs are maintained up to the doping of almost 20% of the lattice sites , which we call the doped mott region of monolayer @xmath2he .",
    "theoretically , fuseya and ogata @xcite have proposed the triangular - lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model with four - spin ring - exchange interactions as an effective model for the doped mott region of the system and obtained its ground - state phase diagram .",
    "the low - energy excitations of the model were also discussed .",
    "they have thereby argued that there is a new - type anomalous quantum - liquid phase , characteristic of the `` spin - charge separation '' , which may be relevant with the anomalous features observed in the doped mott region of the monolayer @xmath2he adsorbed on a graphite surface .",
    "motivated by such developments in the field , we study in this paper the triangular - lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model with the multiple - spin exchange interactions further .",
    "in particular , we directly calculate the spin and density excitation spectra and single - particle spectra as well as the temperature dependence of the specific heat and uniform magnetic susceptibility by using an exact - diagonalization technique on small clusters .",
    "we thereby consider the anomalous properties observed in the doped mott region of the two - dimensional liquid @xmath2he adsorbed on a graphite surface .",
    "we will thus demonstrate that the double - peak structure actually appears in the temperature dependence of the specific heat , which is quantitatively consistent with experiment ; the low - temperature sharp peak comes from the spin excitations and high - temperature broad peak comes from the density excitations .",
    "the spectral weight for the calculated spin excitation spectra is concentrated on a very low - energy region that scales with the exchange interactions , while that of the density excitations extends over an entire band width that scales with the hopping parameter of the vacancy . the clear separation between spin and density excitations in their energy scales",
    "is thus found .",
    "the accumulation of the low - energy spectral weight of the spin excitations comes from the frustrated nature of the spin degrees of freedom of the system ; i.e. , the ferromagnetic two - spin interactions compete with the antiferromagnetic four - spin interactions on the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice .",
    "the single - particle excitation spectra suggest that the vacancies behave like fermionic quasiparticles dressed by the spin excitations , with the enhanced effective mass consistent with experiment .",

    "the triangular - lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model with the multiple - spin exchange interactions is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the projected annihilation operator of a fermion ( @xmath2he atom ) at site @xmath7 and spin @xmath8 @xmath9 allowing no doubly occupied sites , @xmath10 is the spin-1/2 operator , and @xmath11 @xmath12 is the number operator .",
    "the summation in the @xmath0-@xmath1 part of the model is taken over all the nearest - neighbor pairs @xmath13 on the triangular lattice . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the four - spin and six - spin exchange operators defined as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively , where @xmath18 with the pauli spin matrix @xmath19 .",
    "the summation is taken over all the possible combinations of four nearest - neighbor sites @xmath20 for @xmath14 and over all the equilateral hexagons @xmath21 for @xmath15 .    in this paper , we study the dynamical properties of the model under the introduction of vacancies in the 4/7 commensurate solid phase of @xmath2he , i.e. , removal of particles ( @xmath2he atoms ) or addition of zpvs . we thus define the filling @xmath22 of particles as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the total number of particles and @xmath25 is the total number of lattice sites in the system ; in particular , @xmath26 is referred to as `` half filling '' , which corresponds to the 4/7 solid phase . the noninteracting band structure and fermi surface at half filling of the tight - binding model with the nearest - neighbor hopping parameter @xmath0",
    "are shown in fig .  1 ; we find no nesting features in the fermi surface and no singularities in the density of states for @xmath27 .",
    "the nearest - neighbor hopping parameter @xmath0 and two - spin and four - spin exchange interaction parameters @xmath1 and @xmath28 have been estimated as follows:@xcite @xmath29 mk , @xmath30 mk , and @xmath31 .",
    "we note that , in this parameter region , the two - spin exchange term favors the ferromagnetic spin polarization ( @xmath32 ) but the four - spin exchange term gives the antiferromagnetic spin correlations between neighboring spins , and thus we have the situation where the strong frustration in the spin degrees of freedom of the system appears .",
    "geometrical frustration also appears on the triangular lattice when the interaction between spins is antiferromagnetic .",
    "we have examined the effects of the six - spin exchange interaction term on the ground state and excitation spectra and found that the effects are very small , in particular when doped with vacancies .",
    "this is because the @xmath15 exchange interaction is easily cut by the presence of vacancies .",
    "we will therefore present the results at @xmath33 in this paper , the model of which we refer to as the @xmath0-@xmath1-@xmath28 model .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we use @xmath34 as the unit of energy unless otherwise stated and we set @xmath35 .",
    "+    we use the lanczos exact - diagonalization technique on small clusters to calculate the ground state and excitation spectra of the model .",

    ", we will in particular examine the cluster with two vacancies , i.e. , @xmath70 .",
    "to calculate the temperature @xmath71 dependence of the specific heat @xmath72 , magnetization @xmath73 under uniform magnetic field @xmath74 , and uniform magnetic susceptibility @xmath75 , the hamiltonian for a smaller - size cluster of 12 sites ( see fig .",

    "( 1 ) when we calculate the magnetic response of the system . in the following , we will in particular examine this cluster with one vacancy ( @xmath77 ) and two vacancies ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the ground - state phase diagram in the parameter space of the present model at @xmath33 has been obtained by fuseya and ogata,@xcite which we have also reproduced successfully . here , we briefly review their results .",
    "the phases obtained are as follows : the region of phase separation ( phase - i ) , the region of fermi liquid with strong spin fluctuations ( phase - ii ) , the region of new - type anomalous quantum liquid ( phase - iii ) , and the region of ferromagnetism ( phase - iv ) , where we follow their notations of the phases .",
    "they have put special emphasis on the phase - iii , which has been argued to be the region of `` spin - charge separation '' and may be relevant with the anomalous features of the doped mott region of the @xmath2he monolayer .    in the following ,",
    "we in particular examine the region of this new - type anomalous quantum liquid ( phase - iii ) using the parameter values @xmath79 and @xmath80 , which we compare with the results of other regions when necessary , i.e. , the region of ferromagnetism ( phase - iv ) using @xmath79 and @xmath81 and the region of fermi liquid ( phase - ii ) using @xmath79 and @xmath82 .",
    "+   +      the calculated results for the temperature dependence of the specific heat @xmath72 at @xmath78 and @xmath83 are shown in fig .",
    "we find that there appears a double - peak structure in @xmath72 at @xmath80 ( corresponding to the new - type anomalous quantum - liquid phase ) ; i.e. , a sharp peak at low temperatures and a very broad peak extending over high temperatures .",
    "the double - peak structure is not clearly seen at @xmath81 and @xmath84 .",
    "we should note here that the specific heat coefficient @xmath85 , where @xmath86 at low temperatures , can not be deduced from the present calculations since @xmath72 decays exponentially at low temperatures due to the discreteness of the energies of finite - size systems .",
    "we will show in sec .",
    "iii d that the low - temperature sharp peak comes from the excitation of the spin degrees of freedom of the system and the broad high - temperature peak comes from the excitations of the density degrees of freedom of the system . in other words ,",
    "the width of the sharp low - energy peak scales with the exchange interactions between spins ( a combination of @xmath1 and @xmath28 ) and the width of the broad high - energy peak scales with the hopping parameter @xmath0 of the vacancy .",
    "it is interesting to note that the double - peak structure in the specific heat @xmath72 due to the separation in their energy scales between spin and density degrees of freedom has previously been discussed in the context of the low - energy excitations in the hubbard ladder systems with charge ordering instability although the latter is for the insulating systems with a charge gap.@xcite in sec .",
    "iv , we will compare the obtained double - peak structure with experiment@xcite .",
    "we also calculate the temperature dependence of the entropy @xmath87 ( not shown here ) , which will be compared with experiment@xcite also in sec .",
    "+      the calculated results for the temperature dependence of the uniform magnetic susceptibility @xmath88 are shown in fig .",
    "we find that the temperature variation is strongly dependent on the value of @xmath28 : ( i ) when @xmath89 , @xmath88 is strongly enhanced in comparison with the curie susceptibility @xmath90 , resulting in the ferromagnetic spin polarization at low temperatures .",
    "( ii ) when @xmath80 at which the frustration in the spin degrees of freedom is the largest , @xmath88 is slightly suppressed in comparison with the curie law . here , the ground state is highly degenerate due to the frustration of the spin degrees of freedom ; in our cluster , the degeneracy is 15 fold .",
    "( iii ) when @xmath91 , @xmath88 is rapidly suppressed with decreasing temperatures . here",
    ", the ground state of the system is spin singlet without degeneracy .",
    "it should be noted that these results come basically from the finite - size effects of small clusters .",
    "however , we may infer the intrinsic nature of the infinite - size system and its @xmath28 dependence from the low - energy behavior under the magnetic field .",
    "the results for @xmath88 thus obtained are compared with experiment in sec .",
    "+      the calculated results for the spin and density excitation spectra at @xmath80 are shown in fig .",
    "the excitation spectra for the corresponding noninteracting infinite - size system , @xmath92 , are also shown for comparison .",
    "we find the following .",
    "the spectral weight for the spin excitations is concentrated on a very low - energy region of around @xmath93 .",
    "this reflects the presence of a large number of nearly degenerate low - energy states coming from the frustrated nature of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the low - energy spectral weight is extended over the entire brillouin zone , rather than special momenta , reflecting the spatially localized nature of the spin fluctuations .",
    "the spectral weight for the density excitations , on the other hand , extends over a wide energy range of about @xmath94 ( entire band width ) , which is more or less resembles the spectrum of the noninteracting system .    from these results , we may say that the spin and density excitations are clearly separated in their energy scales : i.e. , the spin excitations concentrate on the low energy regions , the width of which scales with the exchange interactions ( a combination of @xmath1 and @xmath28 ) , and the charge excitations extend over the entire band width , which scales with the hopping parameter @xmath0 of the vacancy . with increasing @xmath28",
    ", we find the upward shift of the low - energy spectral weight of the spin excitations ; e.g. , at @xmath82 , we find the peaks at a higher - energy region of around @xmath95 , where the momentum dependence of the positions of the peaks becomes significant as well .",
    "thus , the separation between the energy scales of the spin and density excitations becomes weaker .",
    "we should note that the energy range where the spectral weight of the spin excitations accumulates , i.e. , @xmath96 , corresponds well to the temperature range where the low - temperature sharp peak in the calculated specific heat @xmath72 appears .",
    "we should also note that the broad spectra extending over the entire band width correspond well to the very broad high - temperature peak in the calculated result for @xmath72 .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the separation between the spin and density excitations in their energy scales is responsible for the double - peak structure of the temperature dependence of the specific heat .",
    "+      the calculated results for the single - particle excitation spectra @xmath97 are shown in fig .",
    "6 . from the results",
    ", we can deduce the possible quasiparticle band structure and hence the fermi - surface topology .",
    "we find the following .",
    "there are broad and incoherent spectral features over a wide energy range corresponding to the total band width of the noninteracting dispersion , i.e. , @xmath98 , but there emerge the sharp quasiparticle - like peaks with a characteristic dispersion in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "this result is similar to the case of the square - lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model near half filling.@xcite let us assume this to be the consequence of the presence of fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "then , we find the quasiparticle band structure to be fitted well by the noninteracting band dispersion with a reduced hopping parameter @xmath99 or with an enhanced effective mass @xmath100 of the quasiparticle ( see fig .  7 ) . from the fitting , we find the value @xmath101 or @xmath102 at @xmath70 and @xmath80 .",
    "the present results also suggests that the fermi - surface topology of the quasiparticles is equivalent to that of the noninteracting system since the quasiparticle band can be obtained only by assuming that the band width is reduced ( or the band mass is enhanced ) .",
    "thus , the fermi surface is large ( i.e. , its area @xmath103 ) rather than small ( i.e. , its area @xmath104 ) .",
    "the doping dependence of @xmath100 should be interesting , in particular whether @xmath100 diverges or not at @xmath105 .",
    "however , we can not answer this question in our small - cluster study ; the behavior of @xmath100 even in the square - lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model still remains to be a puzzle .",
    "+    we may also assume that the quasiparticle band width shown in fig .",
    "7 may scale well with the energy of the spin excitations , i.e. , a combination of the exchange parameters @xmath1 and @xmath28 , while the entire band width ( @xmath106 ) of the broad spectral features shown in fig .",
    "6 scales with @xmath0 , as in the case of the square - lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model near half filling.@xcite thus , we again find the separation between the spin and density degrees of freedom in their energy scales .",
    "the quasiholes ( or quasiparticles as their conjugate ) are thus the vacancies dressed by the spin excitations .",
    "we should note therefore that the spin and density degrees of freedom are not exactly separated in this sense , unlike in the tomonaga - luttinger liquid in the one - dimensional interacting fermion systems.@xcite only the energy scales are different .",
    "further experimental and theoretical studies will be required to clarify the true low - energy physics of the system .",
    "we may also point out that the enhanced effective mass of the quasiparticle band structure may partly be responsible for the enhancement of the effective mass @xmath107 determined from the specific heat coefficient @xmath85 although the latter can not be obtained from our finite - size calculations . in sec .",
    "iv , we compare the effective mass obtained from the quasiparticle band dispersion with experiment .",
    "the calculated results for the heat capacity @xmath72 at @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( see sec .",
    "iii b ) at the fillings of @xmath77 and @xmath108 are compared with experiment in fig .",
    "we here assume the value of @xmath0 determined so as to reproduce the higher - temperature peak observed in @xmath72 at @xmath77 , i.e. , @xmath109 mk , so that we have @xmath110 mk and @xmath111 mk with keeping the ratio @xmath0 : @xmath112 : @xmath28 = @xmath113 .",
    "we also assume that the total area of the sample used in experiment ( 556 m@xmath114 ) is uniformly active and contributes to the heat capacity .",
    "we should note that the results for the temperature region @xmath115 mk are not reliable because of the finite - size effects where the discreteness of the energies in the system gives the exponential decay of the heat capacity at low temperatures .",
    "we then find the fair agreement with experiment ; in particular , the double - peak structure in @xmath72 , i.e. , the lower - temperature peak that comes from the spin excitations and higher - energy peak that comes from the density excitations of the system , are reasonably well reproduced .",
    "more precisely , we find that our calculated results reproduce the experimental tendency that , near half filling , the lower - temperature peak is high but with increasing the vacancy concentration , the higher - temperature peak becomes larger and simultaneously the peaks shift to higher temperatures .",
    "note that the specific heat coefficient @xmath85 ( or the effective mass ) can not be estimated from the present calculations of @xmath72 due to finite - size effects .",
    "however , we find that the value of the enhanced effective mass @xmath102 estimated from the calculated quasiparticle band structure ( see sec .",
    "iii e ) is consistent with the experimental value @xmath116 estimated from the observed temperature dependence of @xmath72 at @xmath117.@xcite here , we should note that the definition of @xmath100 in the experimental specific heat coefficient is two - fold : one is the value deduced from the lower - temperature peak and the other is the value deduced from the higher - temperature peak .",
    "the two values are , however , not very different at least for @xmath118 , so that we can make comparison with our theoretical value .",
    "then , it seems reasonable to assume that the renormalization of the band structure due to the spin excitations is mainly responsible for the observed enhancement of the effective mass.@xcite thus , stated differently , the specific heat coefficient @xmath85 should be determined predominantly by the spin excitations of the system .",
    "the calculated results for the entropy @xmath87 are also compared with experimentally determined@xcite entropy in fig .",
    "we again find the fair agreement in their general tendencies .",
    "more precisely , we find that the calculated curves of @xmath72 cross the line of the entropy of @xmath24 free spins @xmath119 at @xmath12010 mk , at which the lower - temperature peak in @xmath72 terminates .",
    "this result also supports that the lower - temperature peak in @xmath72 comes from the excitations of the spin degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "the higher - energy peak should therefore come from the density degrees of freedom or motions of vacancies in the system .",
    "note that the experimentally determined@xcite entropy is significantly smaller than @xmath119 even in the vicinity of half filling , @xmath121 , and even at temperatures of @xmath122 mk where the lower - temperature peak in @xmath72 terminates .",
    "the missing entropy may reside in the region of much lower temperatures that the present experiment does not approach.@xcite     +    the calculated results for the magnetization under the uniform magnetic field are compared with experiment in fig .",
    "we should note that the experimentally applied magnetic field , which is @xmath123 in our calculations , is very small in comparison with the energy scales of the @xmath2he system , so that the behavior of the magnetization under the uniform magnetic field is the same as that of the uniform magnetic susceptibility defined at @xmath124 .",
    "we find that , although the finite - size effect is strong at low temperatures , the calculated magnetization at @xmath80 is consistent with experiment in the sense that the value is somewhat smaller than the value expected from the curie law @xmath125 . for more quantitative comparison , however , one would need the techniques appropriate for treating infinite - size systems , so that experimentally observed plateau - like behavior@xcite in the temperature dependence of the magnetization can be explained .",
    "we have used an exact - diagonalization technique on small clusters to study the low - energy physics of the triangular - lattice @xmath0-@xmath1 model with the multiple - spin exchange interactions , whereby we have considered the anomalous properties observed in the doped mott region of the two - dimensional liquid @xmath2he adsorbed on a graphite surface .",
    "we have calculated the temperature dependence of the specific heat , entropy , and uniform magnetic susceptibility , as well as the spin and density excitation spectra and single - particle spectra for the model , and have considered their implications .",
    "\\(1 ) the double - peak structure appears in the temperature dependence of the specific heat .",
    "the result is quantitatively consistent with experiment .",
    "the low - temperature sharp peak comes from the spin excitations and high - temperature broad peak comes from the density excitations .",
    "\\(2 ) the spectral weight for the spin excitations is concentrated on a very low - energy region , the width of which scales with the exchange interactions , while that of the density excitations extends over an entire band width , which scales with the hopping parameter of the vacancy . the clear separation between spin and density excitations in their energy scales is thus found .",
    "\\(3 ) the accumulation of the spectral weight of the spin excitations comes from the frustrated nature of the spin degrees of freedom of the system ; i.e. , the ferromagnetic two - spin interactions @xmath1 compete with the antiferromagnetic four - spin interactions @xmath28 on the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice .",
    "\\(4 ) the single - particle excitation spectra suggest that the vacancies behave like the fermionic quasiparticles dressed by the spin excitations , of which the effective band mass is estimated to be @xmath102 at @xmath70 , in consistent with the effective mass measured from the specific heat coefficient .",
    "\\(5 ) the temperature dependence of the spin susceptibility shows a suppressed curie - like behavior , reflecting the situation where the ground state is highly degenerate due to the frustrated nature of the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "we hope that the present study will shed more light on the physics of the two - dimensional @xmath2he systems and stimulate further experimental and theoretical studies of the systems in greater details .",
    "we have focused on the doped mott region of the monolayer @xmath2he in this paper .",
    "however , it has recently been reported@xcite that the bilayer @xmath2he systems also contain rich physics concerning heavy fermions with quantum criticality , which we want to leave for future study .",
