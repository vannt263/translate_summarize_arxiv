    "in this paper we study approximations to the solution of the wave equation defined by a one - dimensional fractal measure .",
    "such fractals have recently attracted considerable attention because of their relation to classical analysis on one hand , and having many unusual properties on the other hand . in such situations",
    "classical approximation methods have to be modified to produce accurate results , see . in this paper",
    "we investigate the solution of the wave equation theoretically , and also provide numerical examples .",
    "our long term goal is to combine ideas of strichartz , including the celebrated strichartz estimates , with some recent results , such as @xcite and @xcite , in a comprehensive study of wave equations on fractals and fractafolds .",
    "however currently there are few mathematical tools developed to study wave equations on fractals , despite the fact that the existence of large gaps in the spectrum on many fractals , together with heat kernel estimates , implies that fourier series on these fractals can have better convergence than in the classical case ( and , as was noted by strichartz in @xcite , ... is the first kind of example which improves on the corresponding results in smooth analysis ) . among the most recent results ,",

    "assumptions ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and more substantially on certain heat kernel estimates . in general , the heat kernel estimates on fractals is a difficult and extensively studied subject , with most relevant recent results and references contained in @xcite .",
    "it is not clear at present if the heat kernel estimates assumed in @xcite can be verified for fractal measures that we consider , but some preliminary results can be found in @xcite .",
    "the most intuitive idea , essentially due to strichartz , is that there is no reason why the wave propagation speed should be finite on fractals , because of the difference in time and laplacian scalings . in our paper",
    "we do not discuss the wave propagation speed directly , but rather develop approximating tools that may help in this study .",
