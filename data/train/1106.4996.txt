    "@xcite for a recent review . )",
    "if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the density and pressure , respectively , of the dark energy , then the dark energy can be characterized by the equation - of - state parameter @xmath5 , defined by @xmath6    it was first noted by caldwell @xcite that observational data do not rule out the possibility that @xmath7 . such ",
    "phantom \" dark energy models have several peculiar properties .",
    "the density of the dark energy _ increases _ with increasing scale factor , and both the scale factor and the phantom energy density can become infinite at a finite @xmath8 , a condition known as the  big rip \" @xcite .",
    "it has even been suggested that the finite lifetime for the universe in these models may provide an explanation for the apparent coincidence between the current values of the matter density and the dark energy density @xcite .    while @xmath9 as @xmath10 extends into the future is a necessary condition for a future singularity , it is not sufficient .",
    "in particular , if @xmath0 approaches @xmath11 sufficiently rapidly , then it is possible to have a model in which @xmath3 increases with time , but in which there is no future singularity .",
    "conditions which produce such an evolution ( specified in terms of @xmath4 as a function of @xmath3 ) were explored in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we examine such models in more detail . in particular",
    ", we will extend the parameter space discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite in both directions , showing that there are nonsingular models in which @xmath3 increases more rapidly than the nonsingular models discussed in those references , and , conversely , that there are singular models with @xmath3 increasing less rapidly than the singular models discussed in refs .",
    "models without a future singularity in which @xmath3 increases with time will nonetheless eventually lead to a dissolution of bound structures at some point in the future , a process we have dubbed the  little rip .",
    "\" we discuss the time scales over which this process occurs . finally , we consider observational constraints on these models .    in the next section ,",
    "we examine the conditions necessary for a future singularity in models with @xmath1 . in secs .",
    "iii and iv , specific little - rip models and disintegration of bound systems are studied . finally , in sec .",
    "v , there is discussion .",
    "we limit our discussion to a spatially flat universe , for which the friedmann equation is [ fried1 ] ( ) ^2 = , where @xmath12 is the total density , @xmath10 is the scale factor , the dot will always denote a time derivative , and we take @xmath13 throughout .",
    "we will examine the future evolution of our universe from the point at which the pressure and density are dominated by the dark energy , so we can assume @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and for simplicity we will drop the @xmath16 subscript .",
    "then the dark energy density evolves as [ fried2 ] = -3()(+ p ) .",
    "the simplest way to achieve @xmath1 is to take a scalar field lagrangian with a negative kinetic term , and the conditions necessary for a future singularity in such models have been explored in some detail @xcite . here",
    ", however , we explore the more general question of the conditions under which a dark energy density that increases with time can avoid a future singularity , and the consequences of such models .",
    "one can explore this question from a variety of starting points , by specifying , for example , the scale factor @xmath10 as a function of the time @xmath8 ( an approach taken , for example , in refs .",
    "alternately one can specify the pressure @xmath17 as a function of the density @xmath12 , as in refs .",
    "note that this is equivalent to specifying the equation - of - state parameter @xmath0 as a function of @xmath12 , since @xmath18 .",
    "finally , one can specify the density @xmath12 as a function of the scale factor @xmath10 .",
    "since we are interested specifically in nonsingular models for which @xmath12 increases with @xmath10 , we shall adopt this last approach , but we will briefly examine the other two starting points . of course , given any one of these three functions , the other two can be derived uniquely , but not always in a useful form .",
    "for example , suppose that we specify @xmath19 . in order to avoid a big rip , it is sufficient that @xmath19 simply be a nonsingular function for all @xmath8 .",
    "writing @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a nonsingular function , the density is given by equation ( [ fried1 ] ) as @xmath22 , and the condition that @xmath12 be an increasing function of @xmath10 is simply @xmath23 , which is satisfied as long as @xmath24 thus , all little - rip models are described by an equation of the form ( [ a(t ) ] ) , with nonsingular @xmath25 satisfying equation ( [ ddf ] ) .",
    "now consider the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite , who expressed the pressure as a function of the density in the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 ensures that the @xmath12 increases with scale factor . in order to determine the existence of a future singularity",
    ", one can integrate equation ( [ fried2 ] ) to obtain @xcite @xmath28 and equation ( [ fried1 ] ) then gives @xcite @xmath29",
    "the condition for a big - rip singularity is that the integral in equation ( [ trho ] ) converges .",
    "taking a power law for @xmath30 , namely @xmath31 we see that a future singularity can be avoided for @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we examine this boundary in more detail below , noting that one can have @xmath30 increase more rapidly than @xmath33 without a future singularity .",
    "now consider the third possibility : specifying the density @xmath12 as an increasing function of scale factor @xmath10 .",
    "we will seek upper and lower bounds on the growth rate of @xmath34 that can be used to determine whether or not a big - rip singularity is produced . defining @xmath35 , we can rewrite equation ( [ fried1 ] ) as @xmath36 and the condition for avoiding a future big - rip singularity is @xmath37 the case @xmath38 from refs .",
    "@xcite corresponds to    @xmath39    where @xmath40 requires @xmath41 , and we take @xmath42 and @xmath43 at a fixed time @xmath44 . expressing this density as a function of time rather than scale factor gives a much simpler expression : @xmath45 the equation - of - state parameter @xmath0 corresponding to equation ( [ model1 ] ) can be derived from the relation @xmath46 : @xmath47 and the corresponding expansion law is @xmath48}. \\label{aaa}\\ ] ]    however , we can find @xmath34 for which @xmath12 increases more rapidly with @xmath10 , but for which equation ( [ condition ] ) is still satisfied .",
    "for example , writing @xmath49 as @xmath50 satisfies equation ( [ condition ] ) .",
    "an example of such a @xmath12 , with a free parameter b , is @xmath51 where the choice @xmath52 leads to a real , nonnegative @xmath12 and an analytic form for the behavior of @xmath19 : @xmath53 } } } -1 ) } -b .",
    "\\label{bbb}\\ ] ]    this argument can be extended further . in general ,",
    "if we denote @xmath54 , where the logarithm on the right - hand side is iterated @xmath55 times , then any function of the form @xmath56 satisfies equation ( [ condition ] ) as @xmath57 and avoids a big - rip singularity .",
    "a density increasing as in equation ( [ nestedlog ] ) leads to an expansion law of the form @xmath58 where there are @xmath59 exponentials .",
    "we have omitted the constants in equations ( [ nestedlog ] ) and ( [ nestedexp ] ) for the sake of clarity .",
    "equation ( [ nestedexp ] ) , while growing extraordinarily rapidly , is manifestly nonsingular . while an expansion law of this sort might seem absurd ,",
    "it is probably less so than a big - rip expansion law , and in any case our goal is to try to determine the boundary between little - rip and big - rip evolution for @xmath34 . in this spirit , consider the slowest growing power - law modification to equation ( [ nestedlog ] ) : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a constant .",
    "no matter how small @xmath62 is , and despite the fact that it modifies an extraordinarily slowly growing nested logarithm function , the growth law in equation ( [ nestedrip ] ) leads to a future big - rip singularity .",
    "note that the bounds specified by equations ( [ nestedlog ] ) and ( [ nestedrip ] ) are not sharp ; we can always find forms for @xmath34 that interpolate between these two behaviors and produce either a little rip or a big rip .",
    "however , as we take @xmath63 to be arbitrarily large , nearly any function of interest will increase more rapidly than equation ( [ nestedlog ] ) or more slowly than equation ( [ nestedrip ] ) , allowing us a practical , if not a rigorously sharp , bound .",
    "this lack of a sharp bound is due to the fact that there is no bound on the fastest growing function @xmath19 which is nonsingular at finite @xmath8 .",
    "if one is willing to place other restrictions on the form of @xmath34 , then more stringent bounds apply .",
    "barrow @xcite demonstrated that if @xmath64 is a rational function of @xmath10 and @xmath8 , and @xmath19 is nonsingular at finite @xmath8 , then @xmath19 can grow no more rapidly than the double exponential of a polynomial in @xmath8 .",
    "our equation ( [ nestedlog ] ) violates this condition because of the logarithmic functions .",
    "here we shall examine in more detail the two specific little - rip models given by equations ( [ model1 ] ) and ( [ model2 ] ) , which we will call model 1 and model 2 , respectively . note that we do _ not _ make use of equations ( [ aaa ] ) and ( [ bbb ] ) here , as these are valid only when the matter density can be neglected in comparison to the dark energy density .",
    "model 1 is characterized by a single free parameter @xmath65 , and the scale factor behaves asymptotically as a double exponential in @xmath8 , as in equation ( [ aaa ] ) : @xmath66 the parameter @xmath65 is chosen to make a best fit to the latest supernova data from the supernova cosmology project @xcite , and has the best - fit value @xmath67 , while a @xmath68 c.l .",
    "fit can be found for the range @xmath69 .",
    "model 2 is characterized by the free parameter @xmath70 and has a scale factor that behaves asymptotically as a triple exponential in @xmath8 , as in equation ( [ bbb ] ) : @xmath71 the parameter @xmath70 is chosen to make a best fit to @xcite as well , and it has the value @xmath72 . the confidence interval for @xmath70 at the @xmath68 c.l .",
    "is @xmath73 . in fitting both models ,",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 km s@xmath77 mpc@xmath77 , which are consistent with the best - fit ranges for these values given by wmap @xcite .",
    "the resultant hubble and residual @xmath78cdm ( @xmath79 ) plots of distance modulus @xmath80 versus redshift @xmath81 for both models are displayed in fig",
    "+    not surprisingly , the best - fit models closely resemble the @xmath78cdm model , which is known to be an excellent fit to the data @xcite . to see this more clearly , note that our models will resemble a cosmological constant at low redshift as long as @xmath82 for @xmath83 . for model 1",
    ", this condition is satisfied when @xmath84 in equation ( [ model1 ] ) , while for model 2 , we require @xmath85 in equation ( [ model2 ] ) . to see that @xmath70 should be close to this value",
    ", one should expand equation ( [ model2 ] ) around @xmath43 .",
    "the zeroth - order term is @xmath86 , and the coefficient for the first - order term is @xmath87 when @xmath88 .",
    "a comparison with our best - fit values indicates that these conditions are , indeed , satisfied .",
    "furthermore , in the limit where these conditions are satisfied , these little - rip models closely resemble , at low redshift , big - rip models close to @xmath78cdm , i.e. , models with constant @xmath1 and @xmath89 . to see this , recall that constant-@xmath0 big - rip models have a density varying with scale factor as @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 not too far from 1 , equation ( [ rhorip ] )",
    "behaves as @xmath93.\\ ] ] equation ( [ model1 ] ) reduces to equation ( [ rhorhip2 ] ) for @xmath84 , with @xmath94 .",
    "a feature of a big rip is that all bound - state systems disintegrate before the final singularity @xcite . here",
    "we show that little - rip models , despite not having a final singularity , also produce the disintegration of bound structures . as a first approximation ,",
    "the disintegration time is when the dark energy density equals the mean density of the system .",
    "a more accurate method was presented in @xcite .",
    "we shall employ both methods to estimate the disintegration of the sun - earth system .",
    "gyrs , it will envelope mercury and venus , and ( maybe ) earth @xcite . here , for the sake of making a point , we assume the earth will continue to orbit the sun until unbound by dark energy . ] for the little - rip models 1 and 2 , with the best - fit parameters derived in the previous section , we find the time @xmath95 from the present time @xmath44 until the earth ( @xmath96 ) - sun ( @xmath97 ) system is disintegrated to be : @xmath98 @xmath99 note that the disintegration time for model 2 is less than that of model 1 , which is expected since @xmath12 for model 2 grows faster than @xmath12 for model 1 .",
    "it is straightforward to estimate the corresponding @xmath95 for big - rip models with constant @xmath0 to be @xcite @xmath100 and it is almost identical to @xmath101 , which is about one year later .",
    "clearly , little - rip models can produce this disintegration either earlier or later than big - rip models , depending on the exact parameters of each model .",
    "for example , by putting , @xmath102 in equation ( [ br ] ) , we find a value of @xmath103 tyrs for @xmath95 , which is larger than that of models 1 and 2 in eqs.([lra ] , [ lrb ] ) . in this case",
    ", disintegration occurs earlier in the little - rip model than in the big - rip model .    the five energy conditions ( weak , null , dominant , null dominant , strong ) ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) are all violated by all little - rip and big - rip models . a simple way to see",
    "this is that if @xmath1 , which occurs for any rip , a boost is allowed with @xmath104 to an inertial frame with negative energy density .",
    "having said that , if general relativity itself fails for length scales bigger than that of galaxies , we may not be constrained by the same energy conditions .",
    "in the big rip , the scale factor and density diverge in a singularity at a finite future time . in the @xmath78cdm model",
    ", there is no such divergence and no disintegration because the dark energy density remains constant .",
    "the little rip interpolates between these two cases ; mathematically it can be represented as an infinite limit sequence which has the big rip and the @xmath78cdm model as its boundaries .",
    "such models can be represented generically by a density varying with scale factor as in equation ( [ nestedlog ] ) .",
    "physically , in the little rip , the scale factor and the density are never infinite at a finite time .",
    "nevertheless , such models generically lead to structure disintegration at a finite time . for models consistent with current supernova observations ,",
    "such disintegration can occur either earlier or later in a little - rip model than in a big - rip model , depending on the parameters chosen for the models . however , for a given present - day value of @xmath0 , the big - rip model with constant @xmath0 will necessarily lead to an earlier disintegration than the little - rip model with the same present - day value of @xmath0 .",
    "this results from the fact that @xmath0 increases monotonically in the little rip models , resulting in a smaller value for @xmath12 at any given @xmath10 than in the corresponding constant-@xmath0 big - rip model , and therefore , a lower expansion rate .",
    "thus , supernova bounds on the epoch of disintegration for constant-@xmath0 big - rip models also apply to little - rip models ; one can not simultaneously satisfy supernova constraints and hasten the onset of disintegration to an arbitrarily early time simply by iterating exponentials in the expansion law .    furthermore , supernova data force",
    "both big - rip and little - rip models into a region of parameter space in which both models resemble @xmath78cdm . in this limit ,",
    "big - rip and little - rip models produce essentially the same expansion law up to the present , despite having very different future evolution .",
    "thus , current data already make it essentially impossible to determine whether or not the universe will end in a future singularity .",
    "finally , we remark that since the novel and speculative cyclic cosmology proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite requires only disintegration and not a singularity , such cyclicity would seem to be possible within a little - rip model instead of the big rip considered in @xcite .",
    "this is one potentially fruitful direction for future research @xcite .",
