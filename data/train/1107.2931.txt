    "the sky subtracted data cubes were aligned spatially on the peak flux of the [ oiii ] line map of the galaxy and co - added .      to measure kinematics from the final co - added data cube , gaussian functions were fit to the [ oiii ] line in the spectrum of each spatial pixel in which the galaxy was detected .",

    "the most direct comparison for the swift observations is to the cfht images , rather than the @xmath35 image , since the image fwhm for the cfht images is @xmath55 , similar to that during the swift observations ( @xmath52 ) .",

    "the number of spatial elements per resolution element ( i.e. , the oversampling rate ) for the swift maps is @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath12 map is consistent with a maximum value of @xmath57sin(@xmath58 ) of @xmath59 km s@xmath1 , where @xmath58 is the inclination of the galaxy .",

    "it is more likely that this galaxy is viewed nearly face - on , i.e. with an inclination @xmath60 .",

    "an h@xmath97 line luminosity is adopted from the deep2 spectrum since the eagle is compared with galaxies in deep2 for which measurements and calibrations are performed in the same manner . the h@xmath97 line luminosity is measured following @xcite , and is @xmath100 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "a _ lower limit _ to the emission line - determined sfr of the eagle is derived from the h@xmath97 line under the assumption of _ no extinction _",
    "( i.e. , case b recombination at @xmath101k : h@xmath97/h@xmath25 = 0.35 , @xcite ) , namely 11.3 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 .",
    "an _ upper limit _ is derived using a lower bound to the balmer decriment for a distribution of blue galaxies in deep2 over @xmath102 ( the redshift range where both lines can be measured ) from @xcite , namely 0.11 .",
    "this results in a sfr of 36.0 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 .",
    "finally , to estimate the _ mean _ sfr of the eagle from its h@xmath97 line luminosity , the average balmer decriment for galaxies in @xcite is adopted , namely 0.198 .",
    "this results in a sfr of 20.3 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 . in summary ,",
    "the sfr of the eagle derived from h@xmath97 and not corrected further for extinction is 20.3 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 for a @xcite imf , with lower and upper limits of 11.3 and 36.0 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the mean sfr since we know there is some dust present due to its detection at @xmath94 m .",
    "sfrs derived from uv flux rely on stellar models to predict the uv flux from o and b stars and assume that the extinction is given by a measurement of the uv slope .",
    "because intermediate - age stars also contribute to the uv flux , a simultaneous fit is typically made to the young and older stellar populations , and a dust model is assumed .",
    "such a fit for the eagle is adopted from @xcite and results in a sfr of @xmath103 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 ( corrected for extinction with the uv slope ) .",
    "the uncorrected value is 3.5 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 .",
    "the discrepancy between this measurement and the h@xmath97-derived sfr is somewhat unusual . along with the low 24@xmath104-derived sfr , it is evidence that extinction is low in star - forming regions in the eagle .",
    "the sfr from the 24@xmath92 m flux ( 6 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 ) is less than even the lower limit to the sfr derived from h@xmath97 which is not corrected for extinction ( 11.3 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 ) .",
    "even though both these measurements are uncertain to within a factor of @xmath105 due to statistical scatter in the flux - to - sfr conversion , they differ systematically .",
    "the sfr derived from 24@xmath92 m is calculated under the assumption that dust captures all the uv flux ( calorimeter assumption ) , and the sfr derived from h@xmath97 with zero dust correction ( 11.3 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 , lower limit ) assumed that dust captures none of the ionizing or h@xmath97 flux . for the vast majority of galaxies in the deep2 survey ,",
    "the sfr derived from 24@xmath92 m is greater than the uncorrected line - derived sfr by a factor of @xmath106 .",
    "there are hardly any galaxies where the uncorrected emission line - derived sfr is greater than the 24@xmath92m - derived sfr .",
    "the eagle is an exception as its emission - line sfr is greater by at least a factor of @xmath105 ( 11.3 versus 6 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite find the 24@xmath92m - derived sfr dominates the uncorrected uv - derived sfr .",
    "this discrepancy between 24@xmath92 m and uncorrected h@xmath97-derived",
    "sfrs suggests that the fraction of line emission escaping the sites of star - formation is large so that the calorimeter assumption is violated and the extinction of h@xmath25 could be lower than normal . in addition , a low dust content is consistent with the blue colour of the galaxy , uncorrected for dust ( figure  [ fig : sfr ] , top panel ) .",
    "a total sfr for the eagle is estimated by adding the emission line ( not corrected for dust ) and 24@xmath104-derived sfrs , and results in 26.3 m@xmath8 yr@xmath1 , which has a factor of 23 uncertainty .    to compare the eagle with galaxies at similar redshifts , in figure  [ fig : sfr ] the sfrs of galaxies in the aegis survey at @xmath81",

    "the sample is @xmath107% complete for @xmath108 m@xmath8 and @xmath109% complete for m@xmath110 @xcite .",
    "these galaxies are from the same data set and have sfrs measured in a homogeneous manner .",

    "the fluxes are log @xmath113 and @xmath114jy , respectively .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ]      the multi - wavelength sed for the eagle galaxy is shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] .",
    "fits of galaxy stellar population models to the observed @xmath115 and @xmath73-band fluxes were performed by @xcite to obtain a stellar mass estimate ( @xmath90 ) for the eagle .",
    "these are the wavelengths at which stellar population models are the best - characterised .",
    "the galaxy models constituted a grid of synthetic spectral energy distributions from @xcite which spanned a range of exponential star - formation histories , ages ( restricted to be less than the age of the universe at the redshift of the eagle ) , metallicities , and dust contents .",
    "a @xcite initial mass function , which does not differ significantly from the @xcite function assumed for the sfr calculation , was adopted . at each point on the grid of models ,",
    "the following is calculated : the @xmath73-band stellar mass - to - light ratio , minimum @xmath116 , and probability that each model accurately describes the galaxy .",
    "the corresponding @xmath90 is then determined by scaling the stellar mass - to - light ratio to the @xmath73-band luminosity based on the total @xmath73-band magnitude .",
    "the probabilities are then summed ( marginalised ) across the grid and binned by model stellar mass , yielding a stellar mass probability distribution for the galaxy .",
    "the median of the distribution is adopted as the best estimate .",
    "the @xmath90 measured in this way is robust to degeneracies in the models , such as those between age and metallicity @xcite .",
    "the best - fit model has a log @xmath90 of @xmath117 m@xmath8 , where the uncertainty is taken from the width of the probability distribution .",
    "there are additional systematic uncertainties associated with the imf and stellar population synthesis models adopted which can be as large as 0.4 dex @xcite . at the redshift of the eagle , taking into account",
    "the tp - agb phase of stellar evolution does not produce significant changes in stellar mass estimates ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we refrain from including the irac channel 1 waveband in the sed fit since doing so decreases the goodness of the model fit .",
    "this is possibly because of uncertainties in stellar population models at this wavelength .",
    "the mid to far - infrared points are not included in the fit because stellar population models do not currently include the dust modelling necessary to fit them .",
    "furthermore , although the best - fit model also provides estimates of age , metallicity , star - formation history , and dust content , these quantities are much more affected by degeneracies and are poorly constrained compared with the stellar mass @xcite .      in this section ,",
    "we test for active galactic nuclei , or agn , contribution to the emission lines in the spectrum of the eagle .",
    "this could affect derived quantities such as kinematics , sfr , and stellar mass .",
    "there are two methods which are regarded as the most effective for the detection of agn in high redshift galaxies , where it is generally not possible to isolate the nuclear regions .",
    "these are optical emission line and x - ray selections . neither selection is perfect .",
    "emission lines from the agn can be overpowered by star - formation , and x - rays can be affected by heavy absorption of gas in close proximity to the agn . however , a combination of these two methods is the best currently available to identify agn @xcite .    to test for a possible contribution from agn to the eagle , we first look to an emission line diagnostic diagram derived for galaxies in the deep2 survey over @xmath118 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 5 ) .",
    "this diagram uses integrated rest - frame @xmath119 colour and [ oiii]/h@xmath97 line ratio to separate star - forming galaxies from agn .",
    "the eagle galaxy lies in the star - forming region of the diagram given its [ oiii]/h@xmath97 value of @xmath120 from the deep2 spectrum .",
    "next , we look to the deep @xmath121ks chandra data .",
    "no counts were detected at the coordinates of the eagle in either of the chandra bands .",
    "this places @xmath122 upper limits on the x - ray luminosity of agn in the eagle of l@xmath123 = @xmath124 and @xmath125 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath28 for the soft and hard bands , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we note that the near - infrared through irac portion of the sed in figure  [ fig : sed ] does not show the typical power law shape of an agn . in conclusion ,",
    "the kinematics and emission line luminosities of the eagle are likely not strongly affected by agn .",
    "the oxygen abundances of the eagle and galaxies in aegis at similar redshifts ( @xmath81 ) are estimated .",
    "this is done by adopting the relation between @xmath126 and the gas phase oxygen abundance by @xcite , following @xcite .",
    "the upper branch of this calibration is adopted because the majority of galaxies in @xcite and @xcite with nii / h@xmath25 measurements fall there .",
    "this measurement relies on equivalent widths of emission lines .",
    "it works in part because star - forming galaxies have a relatively narrow range of continuum shapes between [ oii ] and [ oiii ] , and do not have large 4000  breaks . for the eagle , rest - frame equivalent widths of the [ oii ] @xmath127 , [ oiii ] @xmath30 , and h@xmath97 lines ( @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , respectively and all in  ) ,",
    "result in an oxygen abundance of 12 + log ( o / h ) @xmath131 .",
    "in figure  [ fig : z ] , the oxygen abundances of aegis galaxies and the eagle are plotted versus rest - frame @xmath53-band magnitudes and petrosian radii ( measured from @xmath37-band @xmath35 images as described below ) .",
    "this galaxy sample is complete down to at least @xmath132 ( ab ) @xmath133 for blue galaxies ( no red galaxies are shown in the figure ) in the redshift range plotted @xcite .",
    "galaxies from @xcite in the same redshift range are also compared .",
    "the eagle galaxy is brighter by @xmath105 @xmath53-band magnitudes and larger by @xmath134 dex than average for its oxygen abundance .",
    "the oxygen abundance of the eagle is similar to those of galaxies at similar stellar masses in the images survey at @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "-band magnitudes ( top ) and @xmath37-band petrosian radii ( bottom ) for galaxies in the aegis survey at @xmath135 ( filled circles ) and from @xcite ( open circles ) .",
    "typical uncertainties in the measurements of oxygen abundances , sizes , and @xmath53-band magnitudes are 0.05 dex , 0.1 dex , and 10% , respectively .",
    "in addition , for the oxygen abundances , there can be systematic errors in the calibration which may be @xmath136 dex @xcite .",
    "binned averages for the aegis galaxies are shown as open triangles and error bars show the rms scatter .",
    "the eagle galaxy is plotted as a red star .",
    "it is bright and large for its oxygen abundance .",
    "[ fig : z ] ]",
    "the swift 3d kinematic fields demonstrate that the eagle galaxy has a gradient in @xmath13 which ranges from @xmath137 km s@xmath1 and a @xmath12 of at least @xmath2 km s@xmath1 .",
    "whatever the process ( or processes ) is that creates the abnormally high @xmath13 values , it is likely active throughout most of the galaxy .",
    "these @xmath13 values are likely caused by the blurring of velocity gradients , which may not even have a preferred plane , on scales at or below the seeing limit @xcite .",
    "the high @xmath13 s are consistent with the morphology of the eagle , which is quantitatively classified as a major merger , and shows structures unlike those of a normal disc galaxy .",
    "table 1 summarises the properties of the eagle galaxy , and figures 36 compare it with galaxies at the same epoch .",
    "compared to these galaxies , the eagle is extremely bright and blue in the rest - frame optical .",
    "it is highly star - forming with an unusually high sfr as derived from line emission , and a comparably low sfr as derived from far - infrared luminosity .",
    "this suggests that most of the star - formation in the eagle occurs in dust - free regions .",
    "the eagle is also large and bright for its metallicity .",
    "these properties are not surprising given that the eagle was primarily selected to have extended and bright emission lines .",
    "the eagle could be in an early stage of a star - burst brought on by a major merger .",
    "it may have not yet had enough time for metal enrichment , or to have formed the mass of dust typically found in highly star - forming galaxies .",
    "it is possible that the high sfr could drive winds that expose star - forming regions , and , given the lower metallicity , may explain the low extinction .",
    "( there are local dwarf galaxies which show similar phenomena , but this galaxy is much more massive than such systems . ) the low metallicity and strong star - burst may also be explained by a major merger event that brings lower metallicity gas from the outer parts to the centre of the system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is likely that the mechanism which causes the star burst is the same , or initiated by , that which causes the high velocity dispersion and disturbed morphology .",
    "this mechanism is likely a major merger .",
