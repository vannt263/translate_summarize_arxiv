    "there is a general consensus that most ( if not all ) sne ii , ib and ic originate from the core - collapse of massive stars .",
    "observations show that they occur predominantly in late - type galaxies where active star - formation takes place ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , several studies report observations of sne ii and ibc in early - type galaxies @xcite , which are traditionally considered old stellar populations composed mainly of low - mass stars .",
    "although @xcite argue that many of the previously reported early - type sn ii / ib host galaxies may be misclassified spirals , it is clear that at least some of them belong to genuine early - types in the morphological sense @xcite .",
    "@xcite note that all of the sne ibc observed so far in early - type galaxies belong to a subclass of type ib supernovae ; they show a typical type ib like spectrum characterized by the strong helium lines and weak silicon lines at early time , but they appear to be systematically fainter than typical sne ib , and show strong ca ii and weak o i emission lines in late - time optical spectra .",
    "their origin is currently a matter of debate .",
    "their progenitors might be related to rather old stellar populations ( e.g. , helium - accreting white dwarfs or mergers of onemg- and he white dwarfs ; @xcite ) , or their relatively frequent detection in early - type galaxies might be due to their intrinsic faintness , even if they have a core - collapse origin @xcite .    given this intriguing finding , a careful study of the stellar population in the early - type host galaxies of sne ii / ibc is important for a better understanding of recent star formation activities that may be related to such events .",
    "the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( _ galex _ ) ultraviolet ( uv ) filters are particularly useful for this purpose , since they allow us to detect even a tiny amount of young massive stars in galaxies .",
    "many recent studies with _ galex _ data show that a significant fraction of early - type galaxies exhibit enhanced uv light as a sign of recent star formation @xcite .    in this paper , we present the uv@xmath0optical color - magnitude relation of early - type host galaxies of some sne ii / ib , including sn 2000ds and sn 2005cz , which belong to the faint , ca - rich class . by comparing them to early - type host galaxies of sne ia , we discuss whether the properties of early - type sn ii / ib host galaxies differ systematically from those of sne ia , and if the faint , ca - rich class of sn ib can still be explained within the framework of the core - collapse scenario .    throughout this paper",

    "the uv@xmath0optical color magnitude relation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is a particularly efficient tool for studying recent star formation in early - type galaxies because of its high sensitivity to young stellar populations .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmr ] shows the nuv@xmath0r color magnitude relation for the sn ii host galaxies ( blue circles with label ) , the sn ib ( 2000ds ) host galaxy ( star symbol ) , and the sn ia host galaxies ( small red circles ) .",
    "we also show the host galaxy of sn 2005cz ( ngc 4589 ; cf .",

    "we do not have sdss photometry of this galaxy , so we convert its johnson magnitudes ( from ned ) to sdss magnitudes using the equations given by @xcite .",
    "we also show typical early - type galaxies ( grey dots ) for comparison .",
    "the empirical threshold of nuv@xmath0r @xmath9 5.4 ( dashed line ) is a criterion that is used to find old galaxies with recent star formation .",
    "@xcite derived this value from the nearby prominent uv - upturn galaxy ngc 4552 ; hence , it should be considered a lower bound in the nuv@xmath0r color of purely - old stellar populations .",
    "a cursory inspection of this diagram shows that most of the early - type host galaxies of sne ii / ib reside below nuv@xmath0r @xmath7 5.4 , implying that they have undergone recent star formation , while the sn ia host galaxies show relatively redder uv@xmath0optical colors .",
    "we also find that sne ii / ib preferentially occur in relatively small host galaxies ( @xmath10 ) compared to the case of sne ia ( cf .",
    "this is not surprising considering that supernova rates correlate with star formation rates .",
    "it should be noted that less massive early - type galaxies are more likely to have experienced recent star formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite finds that sne ii preferentially occur in relatively smaller host galaxies . but",
    "direct comparison is difficult because interpretation on galaxy size can be tricky when dealing with a heterogeneous sample of galaxy morphologies .",
    "the host galaxy of sn 2000ds ( ngc 2768 , label 4 ) shows a nuv@xmath0r color that is significantly bluer than those of most sn ia hosts , strongly implying the presence of young stars . on the other hand , ngc 4589 ( star symbol ) , which is the host galaxy of another peculiar sn ib ( sn 2005cz ) ,",
    "shows a marginal nuv@xmath0r color .",
    "note that ngc 4589 is a strong 21 cm hi source @xcite and shows large opaque dust patches @xcite . also note that nuv colors are more sensitive to dust than optical colors by a factor of 4 , so the presence of a small amount of dust can have a proportionally greater effect in the nuv than in the optical colors .",
    "after all , the intrinsic colors of this galaxy might be substantially bluer than the observed colors .",
    "our sample includes the host galaxy of sn 2006gy ( ngc 1260 , label 1 ) , which is one of the most luminous supernovae ever discovered . even though the progenitor of this highly luminous sn iin is generally believed to be a very massive star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the nuv@xmath0r color of the host galaxy is not particularly blue compared to the other sn ii / ib host galaxies . like",
    "ngc 4589 , this galaxy has also been found to be fairly dusty @xcite .",
    "we find that the host galaxy of sn 2000ds and two of the eight sn ii host galaxies that show a markedly bluer nuv@xmath0r color ( labels 8 and 9 ) are strong radio sources ( see table  [ tbl : sample ] and figure  [ fig : img ] ) .",
    "recently , some authors argued that radio loudness in early - type galaxies may be related to a recent merger event that enhanced the sn ia rate from young stellar populations  @xcite .",
    "if this is the case , the strong radio emission in these galaxies would serve as more evidence of recent star formation in these host galaxies .",
    "however , not all sn ii host galaxies in our sample have significant radio emission .",
    "the issue of the correlation between radio emission and the presence of young stellar populations should be addressed carefully in future work . +",
    "the use of nuv@xmath0r color to find galaxies with recent star formation ( as discussed in the previous section ) is overly simplistic , as it is based on the assumption that all early - type galaxies should have an underlying uv - upturn component from old stars at a level similar to that of ngc 4552 ( see the review of * ? ? ?",
    "contrarily , it was recently found that only a small fraction of early - type galaxies show a uv upturn @xcite .",
    "hence , we hereby use a more sophisticated method to characterize the stellar populations in our sn host galaxies .",
    "we consider a two - stage star formation history to determine the age and mass fraction of the young stellar component in the sn host galaxies .",
    "both starbursts are assumed to be instantaneous .",
    "the base models in this study are taken from @xcite , which are specialized for old stellar populations . since these models do not cover ages younger than 1  gyr , we combine them with the models of @xcite for a young stellar population @xcite .",
    "we assume a single uniform age of 12  gyr for the old component .",
    "the young component is allowed to vary in age ( @xmath1110  gyr ) and mass fraction ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "more complex models , such as those based on multiple star bursts or continuous star formation , do not affect this analysis very much because uv lights are insensitive to the details of the star formation history , but are highly dominated by the most recent star formation event .    optical color - magnitude relation .",
    "we plot early - type host galaxies of sne ii and sne ia with blue and red circles , respectively .",
    "the dotted line shows the nuv@xmath0r = 5.4 cut , which indicates the color of the nearby uv - upturn galaxy , ngc  4552 ( see the text for details ) .",
    "we mark the sn ia hosts with a color above / below this cut by filled / open red circles .",
    "star symbols denote sn ib host galaxies .",
    "the grey points are the comparison sample of early - type galaxies from sdss - galex cross - matches ( that is , without a detected sn ) .",
    "we also label each host galaxy listed in table  [ tbl : sample].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to constrain these two parameters , we fit the observed uv and optical colors to models , and compute the associated @xmath13 statistic to obtain a probability distribution of the age and mass fraction of the young stellar component .",
    "internal extinction is also constrained in the @xmath13 minimization . the best fit and confidence levels",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig : tyfy ] .",
    "the @xmath13 minimum is marked with circles along with error bars .",
    "we first note that this analysis is heavily subject to various degeneracies .",
    "the most important one for the uv analysis is the age - mass degeneracy .",
    "a larger fraction of the young component is hardly distinguishable from a smaller fraction of the younger component .",
    "the majority of sn ia host galaxies have a characteristic age of @xmath14 for the young stellar component , which agrees with previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our _ quiescent _ sn ia host galaxies ( filled red circles ) are found to have a small amount of young stars , but this is because our building - block population models do not have a significant uv flux such as that exhibited by uv upturn galaxies ( e.g. , ngc  4552 ) .",
    "these galaxies usually have a small uv flux , with which robust estimations of the young component properties are difficult .",
    "they lie along the degeneracy area marked by the pink - shaded region . in this regard ,",
    "the young component mass fraction is an upper limit in the case of sn ia host galaxies .",
    "note that the sn ia host galaxies with a blue uv - optical color ( open red circles ) are mostly below this shade , indicating either a greater amount of young stars or a younger age , both of which produce a higher uv flux .",
    "the sn ii / ib host galaxies are markedly different from the _ quiescent _ sn ia host galaxies .",
    "most of the sn ii / ib host galaxies are located below the degeneracy region , strongly indicating the presence of young stars .",
    "the sne ii in our sample must have a core - collapse origin as mentioned in   [ sec : sample ] , and the above discussion confirms that their progenitor ages are systematically smaller than those of the sne ia .",
    "the host galaxy of sn 2000ds ( ngc 2768 ) appears to have properties similar to those of the sne ii host galaxies .",
    "the relatively strong radio emission of ngc 2768 may be additional evidence to support the connection between sn 2000ds and recent star formation .",
    "the host galaxy of sn 2005cz ( ngc4589 ) also seems to show signatures of recent star formation .",
    "it is located below the degeneracy region in figure  [ fig : tyfy ] , and known to be dusty as discussed above .",
    "our result thus indicates that the faint , ca - rich sne ib 2000ds and 2005cz originate from massive stars like the sne ii in our sample .",
    "our result may give some hints for their progenitor masses .",
    "given the characteristic age of about 300 - 400 myr for the young stellar component in ngc 2768 and ngc 4589 according to our stellar population model , the progenitors of sn 2000ds and sn 2005cz are not likely to have an initial mass much larger than about @xmath15 this conclusion is very similar to that of @xcite for sn 2005cz .",
    "they argued that the high ca to oxygen abundance ratio implied by observation in the ejecta of such peculiar sne ib can be best explained by explosive nucleosynthesis in a relatively small stellar core containing very thin silicon and oxygen shells .",
    "the corresponding helium core size may not significantly exceed @xmath16 .",
    "this independently points to moderately massive progenitors having initial masses of about @xmath17 .",
    "both being sne ib , the progenitors of sn 2000ds and sn 2005cz must have lost their hydrogen envelope , leaving naked helium cores of @xmath18 .",
    "this could be only possible in close binary systems , unless the mass loss rate of their progenitors were unrealistically high ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to note that the initial masses of core collapse supernovae could be lower down to about @xmath19 with binary interactions , compared to the canonical limit of @xmath20 for single stars .",
    "such binary star evolution with initial masses of @xmath21 towards helium stars of about @xmath18 such as sn ibc progenitors is _ required _ to explain the formation of binary pulsars psr b2303 + 46 and psr j1141 - 6545 with old white dwarf companions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that sne ib like 2000ds can be found in some early - type galaxies , hovering around relatively young stars with ages of @xmath22 myr .",
