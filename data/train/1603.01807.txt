    "one of the oldest problems in graph theory that in fact goes back to the end of the 19th century , see  @xcite , is the question : `` what are the smallest and the largest number of cycles in a class of graphs ? ''",
    "it turns out that it is most convenient to study the largest number of cycles in a graph @xmath0 with respect to its cyclomatic number @xmath1 let @xmath2 be the largest number of cycles among all graphs with the cyclomatic number @xmath3 . in 1897 ahrens showed that @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "a big step forward is due to entringer and slater  @xcite .",
    "they showed that when studying the value of @xmath2 one can confine himself / herself to cubic graphs .",
    "namely , they proved that there is a cubic graph with the cyclomatic number @xmath3 and @xmath2 cycles .",
    "also they conjectured that @xmath2 is asymptotically equal to @xmath5 .",
    "there are upper bounds on @xmath2 where the error - term is not exponential , see for example  @xcite and the references given there",
    ". aldred and thomassen  @xcite proved that @xmath6 .",
    "this is still the only upper bound that improves on the coefficient of the leading term . as to the lower bounds , the best one",
    "so far was published recently in  @xcite , where the error term is exponential .    as for the smallest number of cycles",
    ", it has been shown in  @xcite that a 2-connected cubic graph of @xmath7 vertices contains at least @xmath8 cycles , and that the bound is best possible . in the same paper , it was conjectured that the difference between the 2-connected and 3-connected cubic graphs , in a sense , is dramatic .",
    "more precisely , it was conjectured that @xmath9 , the minimum number of cycles in a 3-connected cubic graph , is superpolynomial .",
    "the conjecture was proved in  @xcite .",
    "it is shown there that , for @xmath7 sufficiently large , @xmath10 . in the same paper , it is suggested that replacing the condition 3-connected by the condition cyclically 4-edge - connected may increase the growth of cycles number to be exponential in terms of @xmath7 .",
    "r. aldred has conjectured ( unpublished ) that restricting the graphs to be cubic hamiltonian 3-connected might lead to the same property .",
    "the first main result of this paper supports aldred s conjecture .",
    "we conjecture that a graph @xmath11 defined in this paper , has the smallest number of cycles among all cubic hamiltonian 3-connected graphs .",
    "then we show that the number of cycles in @xmath12 grows faster than fibonacci sequence .",
    "the second result provides a proof technique whose refinement could lead to an improvement of the upper bound on the largest number of cycles in a graph .",
    "our research has been motivated by a computer science application .",
    "cyclomatic complexity is a software metric used to quantify the structure of a computer program .",
    "a program source code can be modeled by a flow control graph  ( fcg ) in which nodes and edges represent code blocks and the possible execution paths among them  @xcite .",
    "the cyclomatic complexity is based on the cyclomatic number of a program fcg .",
    "a software of high cyclomatic complexity indicates a large number of possible execution paths .",
    "such a software would be difficult to test and expensive to maintain . as pointed out in  @xcite and  @xcite , one should estimate cyclomatic complexity in advance during the software design to avoid a complex code structure . therefore , investigating the number of cycles in graphs could help developers and automated code generators in avoiding structures that may lead to high cyclomatic complexity .",
    "it also could help in defining software design templates that lead to building low cyclomatic complexity software .",
    "in what follows it is assumed that @xmath0 is a cubic hamiltonian 3-connected graph , where @xmath13 is a hamiltonian cycle of @xmath14 .",
    "the set of edges in @xmath14 but not in @xmath15 will be denoted by @xmath16 , and called spokes .",
    "we will say that a set of spokes  @xmath17 forms a cycle if there is a cycle  @xmath18 in  @xmath14 so that all spokes of @xmath19 belong to @xmath18 and no other spoke is in @xmath20 such cycle @xmath18 will be called an f - cycle .",

    "@xmath24 stand for the edge set of a graph @xmath25 .",
    "the fact that a vertex @xmath26 is an internal vertex of the path @xmath21 will be denoted by @xmath27 the expression @xmath28 is a shorthand for @xmath29 and @xmath30 the next lemma constitutes a simple but useful observation .
