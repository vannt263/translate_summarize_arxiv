    "nuclear charge densities have been accurately measured with electron scattering and have become our picture of the atomic nucleus , see for example ref .",
    "these measurements have had an enormous impact .",
    "in contrast , our knowledge of neutron densities comes primarily from hadron scattering experiments involving for example pions @xcite , protons @xcite , or antiprotons @xcite .",
    "however , the interpretation of hadron scattering experiments is model dependent because of uncertainties in the strong interactions .",
    "parity violating electron scattering provides a model independent probe of neutron densities that is free from most strong interaction uncertainties .",
    "this is because the weak charge of a neutron is much larger than that of a proton @xcite .",
    "therefore the @xmath1 boson couples primarily to neutrons . in born approximation ,",
    "the parity violating asymmetry @xmath2 , the fractional difference in cross sections for positive and negative helicity electrons , is proportional to the weak form factor .",
    "this is very close to the fourier transform of the neutron density .",
    "therefore the neutron density can be extracted from an electro - weak measurement @xcite .",
    "many details of a practical parity violating experiment to measure neutron densities have been discussed in a long paper @xcite .",
    "the doubly magic nucleus @xmath0pb has 44 more neutrons than protons , and some of these extra neutrons are expected to be found in the surface where they form a neutron rich skin .",
    "the thickness of this skin is sensitive to nuclear dynamics and provides fundamental nuclear structure information .",
    "there may be a useful analogy with cold atoms in laboratory traps were similar `` spin skins '' have been observed for partially polarized systems @xcite .",
    "note that there is an attractive interaction between two atoms of unlike spins while for a nucleus , the interaction between two nucleons of unlike isospins is also more attractive than the interaction between two nucleons of like isospins .",
    "the neutron radius of @xmath0pb , @xmath3 , has important implications for astrophysics .",
    "there is a strong correlation between @xmath3 and the pressure of neutron matter @xmath4 at densities near 0.1 @xmath5 ( about 2/3 of nuclear density ) @xcite .",
    "a larger @xmath4 will push neutrons out against surface tension and increase @xmath3 .",
    "therefore measuring @xmath3 constrains the equation of state ( eos )  pressure as a function of density  of neutron matter .",
    "recently hebeler et al .",
    "@xcite used chiral perturbation theory to calculate the eos of neutron matter including important contributions from very interesting three neutron forces . from their eos , they predict @xmath6 fm . here",
    "@xmath7 is the known proton radius of @xmath0pb .",
    "monte carlo calculations by carlson et al . also find sensitivity to three neutron forces @xcite .",
    "therefore , measuring @xmath3 provides an important check of fundamental neutron matter calculations , and constrains three neutron forces .",
    "the correlation between @xmath3 and the radius of a neutron star @xmath8 is also very interesting @xcite . in general , a larger @xmath3 implies a stiffer eos , with a larger pressure , that will also suggest @xmath8 is larger .",
    "note that this correlation is between objects that differ in size by 18 orders of magnitude from @xmath9 fm to @xmath10 km .",
    "the eos of neutron matter is closely related to the symmetry energy @xmath11 .",
    "this describes how the energy of nuclear matter rises as one goes away from equal numbers of neutrons and protons .",
    "there is a strong correlation between @xmath3 and the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the baryon density .",
    "the symmetry energy can be probed in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath12 has been extracted from isospin diffusion data @xcite using a transport model .",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath11 helps determine the composition of a neutron star .",
    "a large @xmath11 , at high density , implies a large proton fraction @xmath14 that will allow the direct urca process of rapid neutrino cooling .",
    "if @xmath15 is large , it is likely that massive neutron stars will cool quickly by direct urca @xcite . in addition , the transition density from solid neutron star crust to the liquid interior is strongly correlated with @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "recently , reinhard and nazarewicz claim that @xmath15 is strongly correlated with the dipole polarizability @xmath16 of @xmath0pb @xcite and tamii et al .",
    "have accurately determined @xmath16 from very small angle proton scattering @xcite . however , further work suggests the correlation of @xmath16 with @xmath15 is model dependent @xcite .    finally , atomic parity violation ( apv ) is sensitive to @xmath3 @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "parity violation involves the overlap of atomic electrons with the weak charge of the nucleus , and this is primarily carried by the neutrons .",
    "furthermore , because of relativistic effects the electronic wave function can vary rapidly over the nucleus .",
    "therefore , the apv signal depends on where the neutrons are and on @xmath3 .",
    "a future low energy test of the standard model may involve the combination of a precise apv experiment along with pv electron scattering to constrain @xmath3 .",
    "alternatively , measuring apv for a range of isotopes can provide information on neutron densities @xcite .",
    "the lead radius experiment ( prex ) measures the parity violating asymmetry @xmath2 for 1.05 gev electrons scattering from @xmath0pb at five degrees @xcite .",
    "this measurement initially ran at jefferson laboratory in the spring of 2010 .",
    "prex demonstrates this new technique to measure neutron densities and achieved the desired small systematic errors .",
    "therefore the measurement can be improved by accumulating more statistics .",
    "the collaboration purposes to design appropriate engineering modifications to the beamline to mitigate radiation problems and has been granted additional beam time to improve the statistics and achieve the original goal of a 1% ( @xmath17 fm ) constraint on the neutron radius of @xmath0pb .",
    "in addition to prex , many other parity violating measurements of neutron densities are possible , see for example @xcite .",
    "neutron radii can be measured in many stable nuclei , as long as the first excited state is not too low in energy ( so that elastically scattered electrons can be separated from inelastic excitations ) . in general",
    ", @xmath3 is easier to measure in lighter neutron rich nuclei .",
    "this is because @xmath3 is smaller and so can be measured at higher momentum transfers where @xmath2 is larger .",
    "measuring @xmath3 in @xmath18ca is particularly attractive .",
    "first , @xmath18ca has a higher experimental figure of merit than @xmath0pb .",
    "therefore a @xmath18ca measurement may take less beam time than for @xmath0pb .",
    "not only does @xmath18ca have a large neutron excess , it is also relatively light . with only 48 nucleons , microscopic coupled cluster calculations @xcite , or no core shell model calculations @xcite , may be feasible for @xmath18ca that are presently not feasible for @xmath0pb . note that these microscopic calculations may have important contributions from three nucleon forces .",
    "this will allow one to make microscopic predictions for the neutron density and relate a measured @xmath3 to three nucleon forces and in particular to very interesting three neutron forces .",
    "we end this section with a discussion of perhaps the ultimate neutron density measurement .",
    "measuring @xmath2 for a range of momentum transfers @xmath19 allows one to directly determine the neutron density @xmath20 as a function of @xmath21 . for @xmath0pb",
    "this may be extraordinarily difficult .",
    "however , for @xmath18ca this may actually be feasible , although somewhat difficult and time consuming .",
    "for example , one might be able to determine about 6 fourier bessel coefficients in an expansion of @xmath20 .",
    "note that this may require long runs and careful control of backgrounds and could be helped by using a large acceptance spectrometer .",
    "nevertheless , one should not underestimate the utility of having model independent determinations of both the neutron and proton densities as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "this will literally provide our picture of the neutrons and protons inside an atomic nucleus .",
    "radiative corrections involving additional photons are important for a variety of precision electromagnetic and electroweak experiments .",
    "coulomb distortion and dispersion corrections are illustrated in fig .",
    "coulomb distortions , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) , involve intermediate states where the nucleus remains in its ground state , while dispersion corrections , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( c ) , involve intermediate states where the nucleus is excited .",
    "the individual protons contribute coherently to coulomb distortions , and as a result fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) is order @xmath22 compared to the born term in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) . here",
    "@xmath23 is the atomic number and @xmath24 is the fine structure constant .",
    "coulomb distortions are clearly important for prex because of the large @xmath25 of pb .",
    "coulomb distortions can be included to all orders in @xmath22 by numerically solving the dirac equation for an electron moving in the coulomb potential of order 25 mev and a weak axial vector potential of order 10 ev @xcite .",
    "coulomb distortions reduce @xmath2 by about 30% and are the largest known correction to the born approximation . however",
    "the uncertainty in this correction is very small because the charge density of @xmath0pb is accurately known .",
    "the observed @xmath2 is consistent with coulomb distortion calculations and inconsistent with born approximation predictions for any conceivable neutron density .",
    "therefore , prex provides the first observation of coulomb distortion effects in parity violating electron scattering .    in general",
    "the individual protons contribute incoherently to dispersion corrections",
    ". therefore fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( c ) is of order @xmath24 rather than @xmath22 and not obviously large for prex .",
    "there is some information on dispersion contributions to elastic electron scattering , see for example @xcite .",
    "however , dispersion corrections may be particularly important for parity violating electron scattering from the proton because the born contribution in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) is small , of order @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the small weak charge of the proton . as a result dispersion corrections in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( c ) can make a relative contribution of order @xmath28 .",
    "indeed gorchtein first calculated a large dispersion correction to the weak charge of the proton that should be important for the interpretation of the qweak experiment @xcite .",
    "recently gorchtein , horowitz , and ramsey - musolf calculated this correction in more detail and estimated the remaining theoretical uncertainty @xcite . about half of the correction involves nucleon resonance excited states while the remainder is from higher energy `` background '' excitations .",
    "an important remaining uncertainty is the isospin decomposition of this background .",
    "this is necessary to predict the electroweak response from purely electromagnetic data @xcite .",
    "the dispersion correction @xmath29 predicted by @xcite to the weak charge of the proton is , @xmath30\\,10^{-3}.\\ ] ] this is at the kinematics of the qweak experiment , @xmath31 gev , and a squared momentum transfer of @xmath32 gev@xmath33 .",
    "the first error involves the model used to fit electromagnetic data , while the second ( largest ) error involves uncertainties in high energy `` background '' contributions including their isospin dependence .",
    "finally smaller errors are quoted for the resonance contributions @xmath34 and for the extrapolation from @xmath35 , where the calculation was performed , to @xmath32 gev@xmath33 .",
    "this correction @xmath29 is to be compared to the total weak charge of the proton @xmath36 , for a relative contribution of @xmath37 , @xcite .",
    "the correction is large compared to the desired 2% statistical error for qweak .",
    "therefore it must be accurately included in the interpretation of experimental results .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty can be reduced by measuring `` deep '' inelastic parity violating electron scattering at high excitation energies and moderate momentum transfers to constrain the isospin of background contributions .",
    "some other calculations of @xmath29 include @xcite .    at lower energies",
    "@xmath29 is both smaller and has a much smaller uncertainty . at @xmath38 gev ,",
    "@xmath35 we calculate @xcite , @xmath39\\,10^{-3}$ ] .",
    "therefore a low energy qweak like experiment , see for example @xcite , should be very cleanly interpretable in terms of the weak charge of the proton .",
