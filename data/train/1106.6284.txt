    "anisotropic flow is an important observable in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions as it signals the presence of multiple interactions between the constituents of the created matter .",
    "anisotropic flow has been observed in nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions from low energies up to @xmath0  tev at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "the azimuthal anisotropic flow is usually characterized by the fourier coefficients  @xcite : @xmath1\\rangle , \\label{eq : harmonics}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the azimuthal angle of the particle , @xmath3 is the azimuthal angle of the initial state spatial plane of symmetry , and @xmath4 is the order of the harmonic .",
    "the second fourier coefficient @xmath5 is called elliptic flow  @xcite . because the magnitude of the anisotropic flow depends strongly on the friction in the created matter , characterized by the shear viscosity over entropy density ratio @xmath6 , the large elliptic flow observed at rhic provided compelling evidence for strongly interacting matter which , in addition , appears to behave like an almost perfect fluid  @xcite .",
    "however , a precise determination of @xmath6 in the partonic fluid is complicated by uncertainties in the initial conditions of the collision , the relative contributions from the hadronic and partonic phase , and the unknown temperature dependence of @xmath6 .",
    "because of these uncertainties it was not even clear if the elliptic flow would increase or decrease when going from rhic to lhc energies ; a measurement of elliptic flow at the lhc was therefore one of the most anticipated results .",
    "in the left panel of fig .  [ fig : figure1 ] the alice measurement at 2.76 tev  @xcite shows that the integrated elliptic flow of charged particles increases by about 30% compared to flow measured at the highest rhic energy of 0.2 tev .",
    "this result indicates that the hot and dense matter created in these collisions at the lhc still behaves like a fluid with almost zero friction , providing strong constraints on the temperature dependence of @xmath6 .    experimentally , because the planes of symmetry @xmath3 in eq .",
    "[ eq : harmonics ] are not known , the anisotropic flow coefficients are estimated from measured correlations between the observed particles . the right panel shows the integrated elliptic flow ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 gev/@xmath9 ) obtained from two- and multi - particle correlations as a function of collision centrality , compared to star measurements at rhic . here the elliptic flow estimated from two - particle correlations is denoted by @xmath5\\{2 } , while those estimated from multi - particle correlations are denoted by @xmath5\\{4 } , @xmath5\\{*q*-dist } and @xmath5\\{lyz } , for the four particle cumulant , fit of the flow * q*-vector distribution and the lee - yang zeros method , respectively ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .        there is a significant difference between flow estimates from two- and multi - particle correlations both at lhc and at rhic energies .",
    "this difference is caused by nonflow contributions ( these are other sources of azimuthal correlations due to jets and resonance decays , for instance ) and by event - by - event fluctuations in the elliptic flow .    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] , the collision centrality dependence of @xmath5 is plotted in narrow bins ( 12% ) , to reduce trivial event - by - event fluctuations within a centrality bin . in this figure",
    "the effect of the nonflow on two - particle estimates is apparent from the difference in @xmath5 calculated from particles with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "also shown are results from four- , six- , and eight - particle cumulant estimates which are consistent within uncertainties , indicating that the genuine 4-particle , and higher order , nonflow is negligible .",
    "the flow estimates from the cumulants can therefore be written as  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the event averaged elliptic flow , @xmath14 the standard deviation of the event - by - event fluctuations and @xmath15 the residual nonflow contribution . assuming that @xmath16 , eq .",

    "both estimates are in good agreement , indicating that hijing seems to correctly describe the two - particle nonflow contribution .",
    "we currently assign the entire hijing based nonflow correction for @xmath19 as a conservative estimate of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "using the nonflow corrected @xmath18 and @xmath20 we obtain from eq .",
    "[ eq : cumulants ] @xmath21 the results are plotted in fig .  [",

    "the ratio @xmath14/@xmath13 is found to be large @xmath22% ; a similar result has been obtained at rhic  @xcite .    because the magnitude of the elliptic flow is proportional to the eccentricity @xmath23 of the initial nuclear overlap region in the transverse plane",
    ", we expect that the event - by - event fluctuation in @xmath5 will be proportional to that in @xmath23 .",
