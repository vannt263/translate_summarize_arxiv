    "bigravity is a recently proposed theory , which is nonlinear massive gravity that can be free of ghost with the dynamical reference metric @xcite .",
    "this gravity model is called bigravity or bi - metric gravity because the model contains two symmetric tensor fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 and a massive spin-@xmath7 field appears in addition to the massless spin-@xmath7 field corresponding to the graviton .",
    "the new degrees of freedom introduced by another metric produce the possibility to solve some problems in cosmology , that is , dark energy @xcite and dark matter problems @xcite .",
    "the interaction between two metric tensors produces the cosmological constant effectively , furthermore , the matter coupled with the metric @xmath3 produces new gravitational sources as dark matter .    besides cosmological applications ,",
    "bigravity is also interesting as a model of higher spin field theory @xcite because the bigravity model describes the massive spin-@xmath7 field coupled to gravity .",
    "there is actually a spin-@xmath7 meson as massive spin-@xmath7 field in qcd , and massive spin-@xmath7 fields are predicted from string theory or higher - dimension theories .    although it is important to understand the properties of the bigravity , it is not easy in general to investigate the solutions because of two reasons .",
    "one reason is that bigravity contains too many parameters .",
    "these parameters define the form of interactions , and the solutions depend on its combination .",
    "another is that we have too many degrees of freedom in two tensor fields .",
    "we have to solve the dynamics of two tensor fields simultaneously , because they are interacting with each other .    in this work",
    ", we consider the general model of bigravity without specifying the parameters , and study the properties of the solutions . in order to obtain the solution",
    ", we only assume that one metric is proportional to another , @xmath4 with a constant @xmath5 .",
    "we investigate the parameter region which gives non - trivial solutions with @xmath6 , and we also discuss the magnitude of cosmological constant and the condition under which cosmological constant vanishes .    furthermore , we consider the black hole solutions in bigravity and evaluate the black hole entropy . as mentioned above , bigravity describes the massive spin-@xmath7 field coupled to gravity . therefore , by considering the black holes in bigravity , we can evaluate how the massive spin-@xmath7 field near the horizon affects the black hole entropy @xcite .",
    "the author has evaluated the black hole entropy by using the holography @xcite , where we found the solution @xmath8 for a minimal model , and obtain the entropy which is twice as much as the bekenstein - hawking entropy in the einstein gravity .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the entropy is given by a sum of two entropies which stem from two ricci scalars . for black hole solution",
