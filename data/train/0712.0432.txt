    "some of classical stochastic processes have been investigated via analogies with quantum mechanics , and such analogies give us useful analytical methods for investigating various physical quantities and phenomena in classical stochastic processes .",
    "for example , asymmetric simple exclusion processes have been studied a lot by means of the free fermionic representation or the quantum spin formalism@xcite . for the reaction - diffusion processes",
    ", it has been shown that the second - quantized representation and field theoretic approach are useful @xcite ; deeper understandings of the non - equilibrium behavior has been achieved with the aid of the renormalization group method @xcite .",
    "recently , the second - quantization method has been applied to stochastic switching phenomena in gene regulatory networks , with the aid of a variational method @xcite .",
    "recently , sinitsyn and nemenman @xcite have been studied a pump current in stochastic chemical kinetics .",
    "they studied a classical two - state stochastic system in a sea of substrates and products ( absorbing states ) ; the system can be interpreted as a single michaelis - menten catalyzing enzyme or as a channel on a cell surface . under a periodic perturbation of the kinetic rates ,",
    "the classical system gives rise to a pump current between the absorbing states . by means of the expression for the full counting statistics of transitions among the absorbing states ,",
    "they have clarified that there is a relationship between the berry phase and the pump current , i.e. , the pump current can be separated into two parts : one of them is a classical current , and the other is indeed a geometrical one which depends only on the contour in the parameter space .",
    "sinitsyn and nemenman have calculated the geometrical phase in the adiabatic case , in which the oscillations of the perturbative kinetic rates are very slow @xcite .",
    "it has been clarified that the pump current is linearly proportional to the frequency in the low frequency regime .",
    "in contrast with the low frequency case , such a pump current is expected to show a power - law decay behavior with respect to the frequency in the high frequency regime @xcite .",
    "in addition , there should be a single maximum in the pump current , which is a similar behavior to the stochastic resonance .",
    "while this behavior has been obtained by another approach for a system slightly different to the sinitsyn and nemenman one @xcite , it is expected to be possible to obtain the behavior of the pump current by the ` geometrical interpretation . ' furthermore , such studies for classical systems from the viewpoint of the quantum mechanical formulation might become a key step towards deeper understanding of the classical stochastic systems .    in the present paper",
    ", we analyze the pump current in the ` non - adiabatic ' case . in order to evaluate the pump current in the non - adiabatic case",
    ", we will extend the usual floquet theory , which has been discussed by moore @xcite , to a non - hermitian case .",
    "in addition , the floquet hamiltonian can not be block diagonalized in our case , and hence a perturbation theory is applied . from these calculations , we can derive an explicit dependence of the pump current on the frequency of the perturbative kinetic rates , which shows a linear dependence on the frequency in the low frequency regime ( adiabatic case ) , and a power - law decay in the high frequency regime .",
    "the construction of the present paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we explain a model for the pump current , which was introduced by sinitsyn and nemenman @xcite .",
    "the general formalism for the calculation of the pump current is given in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to an extension of the floquet theory developed by moore @xcite to a non - hermitian case . in section 5",
    ", we exhibit an explicit calculation of the pump current with the aid of perturbation theory .",
    "section 6 gives concluding remarks .",

    "the container can contain either zero or one particle in it . when the container is filled with one particle",
    ", the particle can escape from the container by jumping into one of the two absorbing states : the left reservoir or the right one .",
    "in contrast , when the container is empty , either of the absorbing states can emit a new particle into the container . here , we define the pump current as the mean particle current @xmath1 from the container into the right reservoir .    for simplicity , in the present paper",
    ", we consider the following kinetic rates : @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are positive real numbers , and @xmath5 is the amplitude of the perturbative oscillation .",
    "the above kinetic rates mean that only two kinetic rates ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) oscillate with time at a frequency @xmath8 . for the above kinetic rates , there is no classical @xmath9 current , as discussed in reference @xcite . hence , if there is a current , it is called a pump current , which stems from the geometrical term .",
    "we here give a brief summary of the discussion given by sinitsyn and nemenman @xcite , and extend their formulation to one useful for the non - adiabatic case .",

    ", we focus on the fact that the probability generating function is related to the solution of the following differential equation : @xmath33 when we replace the time - evolution operator @xmath34 by @xmath35 , we obtain the following shr \" odinger - like equation : @xmath36 hence , the problem of the calculation of the full counting statistics ( or @xmath32 ) is replaced by the problem of the evaluation of the geometrical phase in equation  .",
    "we here note that the ` hamiltonian ' @xmath37 is a non - hermitian operator , so that we need a slight modification of the usual calculation for the geometrical phase .",
    "in order to perform the calculation in the non - adiabatic cases , one can use the floquet theory discussed by moore and stedman @xcite .",

    "have combined the above floquet theory with the discussion given by shirley @xcite , and obtained a useful formulation for the non - adiabatic geometrical phase in the hermitian case .",
    "we will give the extension of the moore s discussion to non - hermite cases , and hence the following discussion is mainly based on the moore s",
    "one @xcite .      at first",
    ", we give a brief summary for the floquet theorem @xcite . a non - singular matrix @xmath38",
    "is called a _ fundamental matrix _ of the system of ordinary differential equations @xmath39 if @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 mean the time derivative of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",

    "i.e. , @xmath51 , the non - unitary time - evolution operator @xmath52 is decomposed into the floquet product form as @xmath53 . due to the floquet theorem , the non - unitary operator @xmath54 has a period @xmath50 , and @xmath55 is a time - independent operator . in addition",
    ", @xmath52 is the unique fundamental matrix satisfying @xmath56 because @xmath52 is the time - evolution operator .",

    "because of the non - hermitian property of the hamiltonian , we here introduce the non - unitary time - evolution operator of the periodic ` adjoint ' hamiltonian @xmath57 @xcite . the operator is written as @xmath58 , and we decompose @xmath58 , in a similar way to @xmath52 , as @xmath59 .",

    "we here note that @xmath66 is not the conjugate of @xmath67 , but that of @xmath62",
    ". finally , the pump current is evaluated from @xmath68 however , it is difficult to obtain @xmath54 and @xmath55 directly in general ; some additional analytical treatments are needed in order to calculate the geometrical phase @xmath69 .",
    "there are two fundamental matrices of particular importance for calculating the geometrical phase @xcite .",
    "the first is the time - evolution matrix @xmath52 which is discussed above .",
    "the second is the fundamental matrix @xmath70 , which is discussed by shirley @xcite .",

    "we perform the same calculation for the time - evolution operator @xmath58 , and obtain @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "the next step is the calculation of the explicit form of @xmath89 . for that purpose",
    ", shirley has introduced the floquet hamiltonian @xmath90 as follows .",
    "we introduce the fourier expansion of the hamiltonian @xmath37 as @xmath91 where the fourier components are defined by @xmath92 the floquet hamiltonian is defined by the matrix elements @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 is an orthonormal basis for the matrix representation of @xmath90 .",
