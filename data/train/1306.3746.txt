    "<S> traditional polarizer provides a way to convert an unknown polarization into a specified polarization . </S>",
    "<S> according to malus , the intensity of the transmission through such a polarizer is directly proportional to the square of the cosine of angle between the transmission axes of the polarizer and the incident polarization . </S>",
    "<S> there , the intensity refers to the collective behavior of _ many _ photons . here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a novel approach to realizing polarization - filtering at single - photon level . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how _ a single _ plane - polarized photon transports through a polarized analyzer generated by a single atom ( the so - called `` single - atom polarizer '' ) , and provide a single quantum version of malus s law . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the quantum scattering of a single photon by a controllable four - level atom inside a one - dimensional waveguide . by using real - space theoretical approach , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain analytic expressions of the transmission spectrum of the photon . then , our numerical experiments show that the transmitted probability of the incident photon can be controlled by selecting the polarized - dependent transition configuration of the driven atom . </S>",
    "<S> the application of such a single - atom polarizer to linear optical quantum information processing is also discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> polarization control of light is one of the main topics in optics  @xcite . according to the well - known malus s law  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , one can obtain certain polarized photons by placing a polarizer in front of an incident light beam . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath0 is the relative angle between the incoming wave and the orientation of the polarizer , malus s law then says the intensity of the transmitted light is attenuated to be @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 being the intensity of the incident beam ) . </S>",
    "<S> classically , the intensity of a light beam is proportional to the square of electric amplitude and is really a collective behavior of many photons in the beam . </S>",
    "<S> the attenuation of the polarizer is due to the reflection and unavoidable absorption . </S>",
    "<S> for example , around @xmath3 energy of the incident light is absorbed for the so - called polaroid - type polarizers  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , photon loss should be a serious defect for the weak light through a polarizer based on the usual malus s law . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when the detector shows no counts , it is not sure that the photon is reflected or absorbed by the polarizer . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , polarization - filtering at single - photon level is particularly important for the optical quantum communication and linear optical quantum computing  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , many efforts have been exerted to implement all - optical signal processing and all - optical quantum information processing  @xcite , in which one light signal controls another . </S>",
    "<S> achieving this goal is a fundamental challenge because it requires an unique combination of large nonlinearities , low losses , as well as the light manipulation at single quantum level . </S>",
    "<S> the weak nonlinearities found in conventional media mean that large powers are required .     </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath4 ) represents the coupling strength between the atom and the photons . </S>",
    "<S> the transition @xmath5 is driven by a classical laser with the coupling coefficient @xmath6 and detuning @xmath7.,scaledwidth=38.0% ]    also , the single quantum operations imply that the single - photon transport along the optical waveguide and interaction with the other object should be well controlled . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , recent studies of single photon scattered by a two or three - level atom inside a one - dimensional waveguide have revealed a series of interesting features  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , shen et al  @xcite have shown that an incident photon traveling along a one - dimensional waveguide would be completely reflected , if the transition frequency of the two - level atom equals that of the transported photon . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that a single two - level atom can be served as a mirror which completely reflects the resonant photon . </S>",
    "<S> such model then was further investigated with three - level emitter , e.g. , zhang et al  @xcite showed that the photon can still be completely transmitted by the resonant - transition atom if another transition path of the atom is excited classically . physically , in order to reach the one - dimensional regime the coupling between the photon and the transport mode in the waveguide has to be significantly strong ( compared to transversal losses ) . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , great advances to reach such a regime have been reported recently in certain typical system ; a line defect in photonic crystals  @xcite and superconducting transmission line  @xcite . with these experimental advances , various interesting transport properties of single photons , such as single - photon transistor  @xcite , frequency conversion  @xcite , and correlated photon transports  @xcite , etc . </S>",
    "<S> could be experimentally accessible .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we propose a so - called `` single - atom polarize '' , generated by a driven four - level atom embedded in one dimensional waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the usual polarizer , it allows the specific polarized photons pass ( the photons with other polarizations are reflected without loss ) one by one ( i.e. , at single - photon level ) and thus is regarded as the quantum version of malus law .    </S>",
    "<S> the system considered here is sketched in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  1 , i.e. , a four - level atom in an one - dimensional waveguide couples to the left- and right traveling - propagated modes of the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> the transitions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are coupled to the photon mode with the strengths @xmath10 and @xmath4 , respectively . without loss of the generality , the transition @xmath5 is driven by a classical laser with the coupling coefficient @xmath6 and detuning @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the free photon hamiltonian , @xmath13 is the free atomic hamiltonian and @xmath14 describes the interaction between the photon and atom . in the real space </S>",
    "<S> coordinates @xmath12 reads @xmath15,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 denotes the group velocity of the photons . @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 $ ] is the fourier transform of the bosonic creation operator , describing the right(left)-traveling photon at position @xmath19 in the waveguide , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the driven atom @xmath13 is @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 being creation and annihilation operators , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 is the population operator for the atom at the state @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the decay rates of corresponding excited states . finally , the interaction term @xmath14 @xmath26\\sigma_{12}\\right.\\\\ & + & \\left.v_2\\left[c_{r}^\\dag(x)+c_{l}^\\dag(x)\\right]\\sigma_{13}+\\mathrm{h.c.}\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] describes the scattering between photons and the atom . here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath27 is the transition operator from the state @xmath28 to the state @xmath24 ; @xmath10 and @xmath4 describe the interaction between each transition dipole moment and the photon field . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 is introduced to describe the point - like interaction between the atom and photon occurring at @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> now , suppose that the atom is originally prepared at its ground state and the right - traveling photons are sent from the far left . </S>",
    "<S> after the interaction with the atom , the injected single photon may be absorbed by the atom or scattered into the left or the right direction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the general state of the whole system is @xmath31a^\\dag_1|0\\rangle\\\\ & + & f_2a^\\dag_2|0\\rangle+f_3a^\\dag_3|0\\rangle+f_4a^\\dag_4|0\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 ( @xmath33,@xmath34 ) is the probability amplitude of the atom in the @xmath35 ( @xmath36,@xmath37 ) . after the interaction with the atom </S>",
    "<S> , one could observe the reflected or transmitted wave . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding scattering amplitudes @xmath38 take the form @xmath39 , \\\\    </S>",
    "<S> \\phi_{l } & = & re^{-ikx}\\theta(-x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the unit step function , which equals unity when @xmath41 and zero when @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the transmission and reflection amplitudes in the waveguide , respectively . by solving the eigenvalue equation @xmath45 </S>",
    "<S> , one can analytically obtain transmission and reflection coefficients ,    @xmath46    and @xmath47    of single photons transporting along the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> above , @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we now analyze numerically the transmission properties of the single photons transporting along the waveguide with a four - level atom under the classical driving @xmath6 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) , the transmission probability versus detuning @xmath50 and @xmath6 is plotted , where @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> for simplicity , we consider the degenerate case , namely , @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clearly that if the incident photon is resonance with the atomic transition @xmath8 , then the photon is completely reflected . </S>",
    "<S> it resembles the case with a two - level atom as in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and is completely differ from the results of three - level atom shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , when the incident photon is resonance with the atom , the photon can transmit along the waveguide freely . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in our model when @xmath53 the transporting photon is completely reflected .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature is , the classical driving @xmath6 influence obviously the transmission spectrum . as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) , when the classical driving is applied and the coupling strength @xmath6 increases slowly from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , two peaks appear . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if no external driving , the transmission probability for the atom with energy @xmath56 is @xmath57% . due to the influence of the classical driving , </S>",
    "<S> its probability decreases to zero when @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> also , detuning parameter @xmath7 is another important factor affecting the transmission probability of the incident photon . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , we plot the transmission spectrum versus the variation @xmath50 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the position of perfect reflection at @xmath59 remains unchanged , while the position of perfect reflection at @xmath53 is shifted due to the influence of the detuning @xmath7 .    our results demonstrated above showed that , the quantum transport of single photons along an one - dimensional waveguide can be controlled by applying the classical driving to another transition path of the atom . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a convenient way to design certain single - quantum devices with controlled single atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> a direct application of the above generic proposal is to control the polarization - dependent transport of the incident photon . to this end </S>",
    "<S> let s suppose that the transitions @xmath60 are coupled to the left - circularly ( right - circularly ) polarized mode of photon with the coupling strength @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath4 ) . when a photon with left - circularly polarized mode is incident from the left of the waveguide , only the energy levels @xmath61 , @xmath35 , @xmath37 of the atom </S>",
    "<S> are involved which resembles the case of the three level in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the transmission amplitudes of photon in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tran ] ) is reduced to @xmath62    therefore , if the energy of the incident photon is resonant with the transition between @xmath61 and @xmath35 , the photon can transport along the waveguide freely . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) , the width of the transparency `` window '' can be adjusted by the coupling strength @xmath6 of the external driving . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when a right - circularly polarized photon travels along the waveguide , it only couples the transition @xmath9 of the atom . </S>",
    "<S> the transmission amplitude now is @xmath63 one can see from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) that , if the incident photon is resonantly coupled with the atomic transition between @xmath61 and @xmath36 , it will be reflected by the atom completely . </S>",
    "<S> assume that level @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the atom are nearly degenerate , and the classical driving is strong enough , e.g. , @xmath64 then the width of transparency `` window '' is significantly large .    </S>",
    "<S> now let a beam of photons with energy @xmath65 and unknown polarization travel from the left of the waveguide shown in fig .  1 . the present problem is , if the photon can transport through the waveguide with a driven atom ? </S>",
    "<S> generally , the state of the photon with unknown polarization can be described as @xmath66 based on the above discussion , right - circularly polarized photons are reflected completely and the left - circularly polarized ones can be transmitted freely through the waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> since the probability of the incident photon with the @xmath67-polarization ( i.e. , at the left - circularly polarized state @xmath68 ) is @xmath69 , the photon transmit through the waveguide with the probability @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the so - called `` malus s law '' at single - photon level . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that _ the present @xmath70 is not referred to the relative angle between the incoming wave and the orientation of the polarizer in the classical malus s law_. instead </S>",
    "<S> , it is the weight factor of the relevant photon polarization in the state of incident photon .    in order to check the performance of our device , </S>",
    "<S> we define a fidelity function : @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath72 , the left - circularly polarized photons transmit freely and the right - circularly polarized ones are reflected completely . </S>",
    "<S> inversely , when @xmath73 , the left - circularly polarized photons are blocked . in the present single - quantum device , the imperfect factor originates mainly from the dissipation of the embedded atom such as the spontaneous emissions of the atomic excited states . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we numerically investigate these influences on the fidelity in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) , the fidelity as the functions of the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that a reliable quantum device with high fidelity ( e.g. , larger than 99.7% ) can be achieved at @xmath59 in the presence of the atomic spontaneous decays .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a `` single - atom polarizer '' , which is form by a one dimensional waveguide with a driven four - level atom . through theoretically investigating single - photon scattering </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the transmission can be controlled by the selective classical driving . by adjusting coupling strength and detuning of the external driving , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the single photons can be transmitted or reflected , depending on the selection of the additional transition paths of the atom . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , our model can be applied to realize polarization filtering at single - photon level . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , it showed a malus law - like expression in the photon transport within one dimension waveguide . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , one can control the single polarized - photon transport , either transmit or reflect along the waveguide with a four - level atom by using a classical beam to selectively excite the additional transition paths of the atom . </S>",
    "<S> this so - called single - atom polarizer suggests that an ideal polarized - filtering device can be developed for the single - photon transistors and quantum information processing based single - photon technique . </S>"
