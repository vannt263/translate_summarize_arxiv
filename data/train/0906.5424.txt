    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) have been studied for decades , and through those efforts an understanding has come of the final phases of stellar evolution of stars with masses in the @xmath11  8 m@xmath3 range ( also called the low- and intermediate - mass stars , or lims ) . planetary nebulae are ejected toward the end of the lims evolution , during the final thermal pulses on the asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) , thus they are ideal probes to test the ism enrichment from these stars in a quantitative way",
    ". the scientific importance of studying pne in the magellanic clouds ( lmc , smc ) can be very simply summarized : lmc and smc pne are absolute probes of stellar and nebular brightness , size , and shape , because their distance is relatively well known , and because their interstellar extinction is comparatively low and uniform . in particular ,",
    "the smc is a unique laboratory to study resolved stellar populations in a low metallicity environment : chemical analysis of the pne therein gives a direct test of cosmic recycling at low metallicity , which is essential to understanding the recycling of elements within galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the gas ejected at the pn phase contains elements that have been produced in the stellar interiors , and then carried to the stellar surface by the convective dredge - up processes ( iben & renzini 1983 , van den hoek & groenewegen 1997 ) .",
    "the single - star evolution models predict a chemical enrichment of the outer region of evolved lims , both for galactic and magellanic cloud lims alike , which can be summarized as follows :    during the first red giant phase , the convective envelope penetrates regions that are partially cno - processed .",
    "this dredge - up results in a @xmath4c and @xmath5n enhancement , and a decrease of @xmath6c .",
    "afterward , he - burning starts in the stellar core .",
    "later , the hydrogen and helium burning occur alternately in two nuclear burning shells , surrounding the co core , and the star ramps up to the agb .    the second convective dredge - up ( for m@xmath7 , the _ turnoff _ mass , larger than @xmath13 m@xmath3 ) occurs at the onset of the agb phase , when the h - burning shell is temporarily extinguished .",
    "this process carries @xmath8he , @xmath4c , and @xmath5n - rich material to the stellar surface .    during the tp - agb phase",
    ", the envelope is able to dredge - up material after each thermal pulse , carrying @xmath8he , @xmath6c , and other relatively light s - process elements to the surface . this process",
    "is called the third dredge - up .    for m@xmath935 m@xmath3 ( exact mass depends on metallicity , marigo 2001 ) ,",
    "an additional process is thought to occur that alters the chemical composition : the so - called hot - bottom burning ( hbb ) that processes most of the carbon into nitrogen , occurring during the quiescent interpulse periods between thermal pulses .",
    "the key to assessing the above predictions is to measure the abundances of the processed elements , particularly c , n , and o. carbon and nitrogen enrichment depends on the progenitor mass , yielding to a direct connection between observed progenitor mass ( i.  e. , population ) and chemical content . by measuring the c and n abundances in pne , one can at once validate key elements of stellar evolution theory , and measure the contribution of lims to the enrichment of the ism . while o and n abundance analysis is straightforward to do with pne , owing to their bright optical emission lines , the carbon analysis requires satellite uv spectroscopy .    in our earlier study of lmc pn abundances ( stanghellini et al .",
    "2005 ) we have shown that pn morphology is a surprisingly useful indicator of the progenitor stellar evolution and population .",
    "we used a subsample of lmc pne images available from _ hst _ and measured the carbon abundances with stis spectroscopic analysis .",
    "we found that nitrogen enhancement is correlated with asymmetry .",
    "these results are consistent with the predictions of stellar evolution only if the progenitors of asymmetric pne have on average larger masses than the progenitors of symmetric pne .",
    "our results are the first of the kind for extra - galactic pne , and are thus not biased by the large selection effects that limit the observation of pne in the galactic disk .",
    "owing to the smaller metal abundance in the smc than in the lmc , it is very important to extend the lmc study to the smc .",
    "carbon abundance determination in smc pne would probe the metal enrichment rates for low metallicity stelar population .    on these grounds we obtained near uv spectra of 11 smc pne",
    "that , together with the already published lmc and smc uv data , provide a database that has a statistical impact on the study of carbon in magellanic cloud pne . in the present paper",
    "we discuss the data acquisition and analysis of the acs prism spectra ( @xmath102 ) , the abundance analysis to derive carbon in smc pne ( @xmath103 ) , and a discussion of our results in the framework on pn evolution and populations ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "the conclusions are given in @xmath105 .",
    "we observed 11 smc pne using the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) prisms pr130l in the solar blind channel ( sbc ) and pr200l in the high resolution channel ( hrc ) .",
    "our aim is to detect the @xmath111550 , the ] @xmath11 1909 , and the ] @xmath112326 nebular emission lines , to determine the ionic abundances of the carbon ions that are excited in the pn regime .",
    "we select our targets from the smc pne that have been previously observed by us with the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _",
    "( stis , stanghellini et al .",
    "2003 ; shaw et al .",
    "with this selection we guarantee that their morphology , size , optical extinction , and optical fluxes are known . from the @xcite sample we chose all pne that we deemed bright enough to be observed with the observing configuration within a few orbits ( total h@xmath12 fluxes larger than 2.5@xmath13 [ erg @xmath14 s@xmath15 ) . in addition , our selected targets have angular sizes smaller than @xmath16 in order to prevent blending of emission lines in the slitless spectroscopy .",
    "the targets are listed in table [ tb : log ] , together with the observing log .",
    "of these , a few have been observed before with the iue , but none has a sound carbon abundance determination .    the sbc detector is a @xmath17 solar - blind csi multi - anode microchannel array ( mama ) , with @xmath18   pixels , and a nominal @xmath19field of view . the hrc detector is a @xmath17 site ccd with @xmath20pixels , covering a nominal @xmath21field of view .",
    "the wavelength range of sbc / pr130l is @xmath1 1200- 2000  , and the useful wavelength range of hrc / pr200l is @xmath1 1800- 4000  .",
    "the wavelength scale of the prisms is non - linear , with spectral resolution decreasing towards longer wavelengths .",
    "for pr130l , the dispersion varies from about 2  / pixel at the blue end ( r @xmath1 300 ) , to @xmath1 10  / pixel at 1600   ( r @xmath1 80 ) and 30  / pixel at the red end ( r @xmath1 30 at 2000 ) . for pr200l ,",

    "the hrc observations consist of a direct image through a broad band filter ( f330w ) , and two exposures through the prism ( pr200l ) in order to perform rejection of cosmic rays .",
    "similarly , the sbc observations consist of a direct image through f165lp , and one exposure of pr130l , unless the exposure time is longer than one orbit , in which case two exposures were taken .",
    "the direct images have been acquired to establish the zero - point of the wavelength scale .",
    "the pipeline calibration of our data provided bias - subtracted , dark - corrected , and flat - corrected spectral images , as processed with calacs @xcite .",
    "we used multidrizzle and axe to combine the images , correct for geometric distortion , and to identify any bad pixels in the spectrum .",
    "the bad pixels were excluded from the analysis of our flux - calibrated one - dimensional spectra .    the position , size , and magnitude of the extracting sources were identified and determined using the direct images sbc / f165lp and hrc / f330w via analysis with sextractor @xcite . the position of the extracting sources on the direct images have then been projected on the prism images for spectral extraction .",
    "the spectral extraction was done with the axe software @xcite in pyraf . for prism",
    "slitless spectroscopy , the trace and wavelength solutions include spatial variations across the hrc and sbc detectors .",
    "the wavelength and flux calibrations are provided by the st - ecf group in the configuration files for the axe software .",
    "two white dwarf standards were used to determine the flux calibration for both hrc and sbc prisms .",
    "the hrc / pr200l wavelength calibration has been secured with observations of the lmc pn smp-79 and a quasar with both stis and the acs prism @xcite .",
    "the calibration of the sbc / pr130l prism was determined using two quasars @xcite .",
    "background subtraction was performed during spectral extraction . to remove the sky background ,",
    "a local background is estimated by interpolating between the adjacent pixels on either side of the target spectrum , outside the extracting area .",
    "the optimal weighting algorithm was chosen to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio of the extracted spectra .",
    "the algorithm assigns lower weights to pixels which contain only a small fraction of the target flux , due to the larger distance from the spectral trace .",
    "faint objects near the targets were identified by position and size , and then their contribution to the flux was subtracted in the extracted spectra .",
    "the contaminating flux from all other sources was estimated with a gaussian emission model by using the sizes and magnitudes derived from the direct image .",
    "this contamination flux was then subtracted when extracting the target spectrum .",
    "the tabular wavelength and flux of the final extracted spectrum was then read using task tprint and converted to 1-d spectrum using the task rspectext .",
    "we averaged the multiple exposures using task scombine .",
    "the final reduced spectra of the 11 pne are shown in figure [ fg : smp6 ] to [ fg : smp28 ] .",
    "the nebular line fluxes have been measured by integrating the area above the continuum using the iraf task splot with the d or w options .    in table 2",
    "we give the complete spectral analysis of our targets , including the identification wavelength ( column 2 ) , the line i d ( column 3 ) , and the measured flux as a fraction of f@xmath22 ( column 4 ) , where the h@xmath12 fluxes are from the _ hst _ analysis of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the emission around @xmath111650 could well be a blend of h ii @xmath111640 and o iii ] @xmath111663 ( the latter corresponding to the 1661/66   doublet ) . for those low- excitation pne",
    "whose optical spectra do not show the @xmath114686 emission line ( smp  18 , smp  20 , smp  24 ) it is safe to assume that the emission is due to o iii ] . in the other cases",
    "we identify the emission as a blend .",
    "we do not calculate abundances of other elements than carbon in this paper , so we do not present here a detailed analysis of the other emission lines .",
    "typical uncertainties in the emission line fluxes are @xmath23 in the bright lines .",
    "we have examined data quality flags of each exposure , and noticed that a few of the pr200l frames have some saturated pixels at the red end of their spectra .",
    "this is caused by red pile - up , due to the low dispersion in the red wavelengths .",
    "in general the saturated pixels do not affect the measured fluxes . only in two pne , smp  15 and smp  18",
    ", the saturated pixels affect the ] @xmath112326 emission line , therefore these are listed as lower limits .",
    "furthermore , in some cases the spectra are affected by bad pixels . for smp  24",
    ", the 2d pr130l spectrum falls into an area of bad pixels , as indicated in the data quality file . if we exclude the bad pixels when extracting this spectrum we end up with a very marred 1d spectrum , thus the @xmath111550 line measurement is not reliable for this nebula , even if there seems to be a feature at the appropriate wavelength .",
    "the pr200l spectrum looks much better , but the extension shows a dip on the ] @xmath111909 line affecting the measured flux at an estimated level of 15@xmath24 level . for smp  16 the bad pixels in the pr200l frame affect the measured fluxes of the ] @xmath112326 and ] @xmath111909 lines at an estimated level of 25@xmath24 .",
    "finally , in the case of smp  18 the ] @xmath112326 flux might be affected at the 15@xmath24 level . in the case of smp  25 a prominent niv ] @xmath111485 is seen in the spectrum , but we do not give its flux in our tables since there are few columns of bad pixels 1425 - 1525   range for this pn .",
    "ultraviolet prism spectroscopy performed with the acs have not been acquired often in the past , and the analysis modes used in this paper are unique . in order to have a sanity check of our calibration and spectral extraction we compare the acs prism hrc / pr200l spectrum of smp  79 , a pn in the lmc , with the corresponding spectrum observed with stis spectroscopy .",
    "the prism spectrum was extracted in the same way as for our smc pn targets .",

    "errors in our flux measurements are @xmath23 except the specific cases listed above , as marked in table 2 .",
    "the flux measurements need to be corrected both for galactic foreground extinction and for the smc extinction proper .",
    "the relation between observed and de - reddened fluxes , scaled to h@xmath12 , can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the target - dependent logarithmic extinction at h@xmath12 and @xmath29 is the reddening function at wavelength @xmath11 . since the galaxy and the smc have different extinction curves in the uv @xcite , we need to correct separately for each contribution .",
    "we can write : @xmath30 where the suffixes `` g '' and `` smc '' refer to the galactic foreground and intrinsic smc extinction , respectively .    to evaluate the galactic foreground extinction we used the galactic foreground column density map constructed by @xcite from data of the the parkes survey of the magellanic system @xcite .",
    "the column density was obtained by integrating the emission from @xmath31 to @xmath32 km s@xmath33 , outside the smc velocities .",

    "note that the line extinction estimated in the foreground overestimates the total line extinction in a few cases , thus the smc extinction has been assumed to be zero .      while none of the observed targets had observations in the literature that allowed carbon abundance determination , several have uv spectra taken in comparable wavelength ranges , and limited comparison could be made among data sets .",

    "possibly , many of the pne that have formed in the lmc have higher average masses than those in the smc , affecting the fraction of high - end mass lims that will go through the hbb phase .",

    "they are the two morphologically unclassified smc pne in the lower - left of the plot : low metallicity ( ld06 ) and c / o @xmath601 . not much is known about smp  22 .",
    "smp  25 is quite unique among smc pne .",
    "it is the only pn in the smc where oxygen - rich dust has been detected ( stanghellini et al .",
    "2007 ) , while all other smc pne observed with spitzer / irs have carbon - rich dust .",
    "furthermore , the central star of smp  25 is much more massive ( m@xmath10.82 m@xmath3 , villaver et al . 2004 ) than the typical central in magellanic cloud pne ( villaver et al .",
    "2007 ) , and it is located in the eastern region of the smc facing the lmc , a region that contains younger and more metal rich clusters @xcite and where @xcite found the kinematically younger pne to be concentrated .",
    "smp  25 may have undergone recent hbb activity .    in figure",
    "[ fg : co_ne ] , where we show the relation between c / o and the neon abundance , we confirm the carbon - abundance segregation of smc pne . there is no evidence that neon s abundance has been modified in any way , nor that the c / o ratio is modified differently in the smc than in the lmc depending on the initial neon .",
    "the log(o / n ) vs.  log(c / n ) plot ( fig .",
    "[ fg : on_cn ] ) also shows some obvious and interesting groupings of data .",
    "the segregation of bipolar nebulae on the left side of the plotted line is expected of course , since figures 13 and 15 are not entirely independent .",
    "however , it is clear that the bipolar that exhibit o @xmath58 c also have n@xmath58c : that is , they are `` n rich '' . symbiotic stars and novae stars ( not shown ; nussbaumer et al .",
    "1988 ) are also found in the same region . on the other hand , all of the sample with c / o @xmath58 1 from fig .",
    "13 are also nitrogen poor ; that is , n @xmath57 o and n@xmath61 c. most of the smc pne fall into the latter group , of course .",
    "carbon stars ( not shown ; nussbaumer et al .",
    "1988 ) are also found in this region .",
    "carbon stars probably have not undergone any hbb processing .",
    "we can compare the data in fig .",
    "15 with the yields form models of stellar evolution .",
    "we limit our comparison to the final yields calculated by @xcite , to avoid overcrowding of the plot . the yields by @xcite or @xcite would look very similar to the ones by @xcite on this plot .",
    "we indicate the yields from lims evolution with starred symbols : the four - pointed stars correspond z=0.008 while the six - pointed stars are for z=0.004 , and we used smaller symbols for stars with progenitor masses too low to have undergone the hbb ( m@xmath59 3.5 and 4.0 m@xmath3 for the smc , and the lmc models respectively , as in marigo 2001 ) .",
    "the abundance ratios measured for round and elliptical pne correspond very well with the final yields predicted for the evolution of the lower mass - end of lims in both the smc and the lmc .",
    "similarly , the _ massive _ models are in good agreement with the abundance ratios of c , n , and o in the pne in the lmc with bipolar and bc morphologies .",
    "these results are extremely satisfying verifications of difficult model predictions . in figure",
    "[ fg : cno_c ] we plot the sum of carbon , oxygen , and nitrogen abundances vs.  carbon of lmc and smc pne .",
    "fig.[fg : cno_c ] is a classical diagram for assessing the efficiency of cno - cycling .",
    "the cno abundance would be preserved if these elements were only acting as catalysts , while carbon enhancement via third dredge up is clearly present in the smc pne .",
    "based on a study of lmc and smc optical lines , @xcite found that the observed intensity ratio @xmath62 \\lambda5007 } / i_{h\\beta}}$ ] seems to increase with metallicity .",
    "the photoionization models in @xcite show that metallicity impacts the relative emission line strength of the major coolants , and that the uv carbon emission lines have a significant effect in cooling pne with low metallicities .",
    "now that we have observations of carbon emission lines in both smc and lmc pne we can assess the validity of those models . in fig.[fg",
    ": histo ] we plot the histogram of the i@xmath63/i@xmath64 line intensity ratio for the smc ( thick line ) and the lmc ( thin , shaded histogram ) pne .",
    "the distributions , which have been normalized for the number of pne in each sample , appear to be different at very low and very high intensity ratios , indicating that the carbon emission line is a very important coolant for most smc pne .",
    "we calculate that the average line intensity ratio is 6.23 and 2.36 respectively for the lmc and smc pne , and the median values of i@xmath63/i@xmath64 are 3.34@xmath522.98 and 1.83@xmath520.83 for the lmc and the smc pne respectively , marking a sharp difference in the dominant cooling agents at different metallicities .",
    "the carbon @xmath111909 line is a much more efficient coolant , with respect to the @xmath115007 line , in the smc than the lmc pne , the civ line can also be an important coolant in the low - metallicity , highly ionized pne .",
    "the present paper provides a database of 11 smc pne whose carbon abundance has been accurately derived through prism spectroscopy with the acs/_hst_. the number of reliable smc pne with well - measured carbon abundances has doubled , finally allowing statistically useful analysis of carbon production and cno - cycling in pne at the very low metallicity in the progenitors of smc pne .    by comparing the abundances of smc and lmc pne we found that most observed smc pne are carbon rich , except in a couple of unusual cases , smp  22 and smp  25 , where there is indication that the progenitors underwent the hbb process",
    "this seems to indicate that most smc pne derive from low - mass ( m@xmath653.5 m@xmath3 ) and low - metallicity progenitors . by comparison ,",
    "the lmc has a much varied pn population , where both carbon - rich and carbon - depleted pne are present , indicating a larger range of pn progenitor mass and metallicity , including several pne whose progenitors could be in the 3 - 5 m@xmath3 mass range .",
    "while a larger smc pn sample would improve the impact of these findings , it is worth recalling that both lmc and smc samples were selected homogeneously , and that with the present observations we have increased the statistical significance of the smc pn sample to almost the same level of confidence as the lmc sample ( shaw et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the cno abundances in magellanic cloud pne can now be used to test the predictions of models of stellar evolution .",
    "we found that the data agree impressively with the final yields from marigo ( 2001 ) models , calculated both for the smc and lmc metallicities .",
    "in particular , the yields calculated for turnoff mass @xmath573.5 , and 4.0 , m@xmath66  seem to reproduce pn abundances of round and elliptical pne in the smc , and in the lmc , respectively .",
    "yields from the more massive lims encompass well the bipolar pne abundances .",
    "if we accept the model results then the production of carbon through the cno cycle in the smc pne shows that most smc pn progenitors are in the low - mass end of the lims mass range , while the lmc pne could have progenitors in the whole lims range . in some cases",
    "extra - mixing or other process that were not included in the current models are needed to justify the observed cno abundances .",
    "compared to the smc , the lmc has a been a site of recent or ongoing star formation and heavy - element enrichment .",
    "one of the most important results of our study is that the average abundance of carbon in smc pne is @xmath1 1.5 times higher than the average carbon measured in lmc pne . using the magellanic cloud sample of pne with determined carbon abundances , and",
    "whose irs / spitzer spectra allows a determination of the dust chemistry ( stanghellini et al .",
    "2007 ) we find that @xmath57c / h@xmath58=(4.69 @xmath523.33)@xmath5310@xmath54 for magellanic cloud pne with carbon - rich dust .",
    "this is @xmath135 times greater than the same ratio for pn with oxygen - rich dust , @xmath67c / h@xmath58=(1.35 @xmath520.88)@xmath5310@xmath68 , confirming a strong correlation between dust and gas chemistry .",
    "the present observations also show that the high - excitation carbon emission lines are major or dominant coolants in the low metallicity smc pne , as predicted by stanghellini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , much more so than in lmc pne , where the c iii ] @xmath111909 line intensity is typically a small fraction of the [ o iii ] @xmath115007 line strength .",
