    "the universality of the dynamical critical phenomena in contrast to the static phenomena is considerably weaker , which is manifested in the existence of a wide range of models of the critical dynamics with different dynamical critical behavior @xcite and common critical properties in equilibrium .",
    "this difficulty is partially compensated because the dynamical critical characteristics of many of these models can be expressed in terms of the characteristics of their static critical behavior .",
    "this primarily concerns the models where the conservation laws hold for the order parameter or any other long - lived excitations , in particular , the energy density @xcite . because of the presence of preserved quantities , the purely hydrodynamic terms determining ( and sometimes suppressing ) the influence of the fluctuation processes on the dynamical ( relaxation ) behavior can appear in the stochastic equations of motion .",
    "the critical exponents describing the dynamical critical behavior can be calculated in this case based on the static exponents with the same accuracy as the latter  @xcite .",
    "but there exist dynamical models such that the description of their critical behavior is not a trivial problem .",
    "they are primarily models with purely dissipative equations of motion . to study the critical behavior of such models , special methods must be developed , and dynamical quantities must be calculated independently of the static quantities . among such models ,",

    "the dynamical critical behavior of other real systems such as the ising - like magnets later came to be described in the framework of this model .",
    "the critical dynamics of model @xmath5 was studied in @xcite using the rg methods based on the @xmath7-expansion . to describe this dynamics , one of us first developed a field theory approach directly for the three- and twodimensional homogeneous systems successively in the three - loop and four - loop approximations @xcite , @xcite and then also for structurally disordered three - dimensional ising - like systems in the three - loop approximation @xcite .",
    "but the dynamical critical characteristics were determined in these papers with an accuracy considerably less than the accuracy of the description of the static critical behavior of these systems in the six - loop approximation of the theory in @xcite .",
    "this is primarily due to a fast increase in the volume of calculations already for the lowest - order perturbation series , especially in the description of the critical dynamics of structurally disordered systems . in this connection ,",
    "the requirements for the accuracy of the summation methods for the asymptotic series in this theory used to calculate the value of the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 in the description of the critical dynamics of model @xmath5 in homogeneous and disordered systems become more rigid . here , we first present the results obtained by summing the series in this theory using the pad - borel- leroy ( pbl ) and conformal mapping ( cm ) summation methods to calculate the values of the exponent @xmath0 .",
