    "transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) ( mx@xmath0 where m = mo or w and x = s , se , or te ) are layered semiconducting materials that have recently shown promise for application to a wide range of electronic devices , including the growing fields of spintronics and valleytronics@xcite . in the monolayer limit , tmds are theorized to have a split valence band that is nearly fully spin polarized@xcite near the and @xmath1 points of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "the spin polarization is predicted to be reversed between the and @xmath1 points , implying existence of an unusual spin - valley coupling in the tmds .",
    "the ability to selectively populate@xcite these valleys demonstrates their viability for use in spintronics / valleytronics devices .    despite the importance of the split valence band that governs the unique spin and valley physics of tmds",
    ", there remain questions regarding the origin of these splittings in bulk tmds . in particular , this",
    "splitting is theorized to be entirely a consequence of spin - orbit coupling in the monolayer limit , and a combination of spin - orbit coupling and interlayer interaction in the bulk limit , but there is disagreement@xcite about the relative strength of the two mechanisms in the bulk limit .",
    "current electronic band structure studies of bulk mos@xmath0@xcite and ws@xmath0@xcite are limited by energy and momentum resolution and lack focus on the valence band splittings .",
    "experimentally , the sizes of the splittings have been characterized , but only with limited resolution .",
    "here we present high - resolution angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data of the electronic band structure of bulk mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , and analyze our measurements via parallel first - principles computations .",
    "our findings resolve previous debates on the role of interlayer interaction on the valence band splitting , revealing that the splitting in the bulk samples is primarily due to spin - orbit coupling and not interlayer interaction . in order to gain insight into the nature of this splitting ,",
    "we further investigate its origins , its magnitude , and its correlation with the electronic band gap across a range of tmds .",
    "our comparisons for various tmds reveal the interplay between the valence band splitting , band gap , molecular mass , and out - of - plane to in - plane lattice constant ratio , suggesting how specific tmds would be suited for particular applications .",
    "high - resolution arpes experiments on mos@xmath0 ( ws@xmath0 ) were performed at beamline 10.0.1.1 ( 4.0.3 ) of the advanced light source at a temperature of 150  k using 50  ev ( 52 - 120  ev ) photons .",
    "the total energy resolution was 10  mev ( 20  mev ) for experiments on mos@xmath0 ( ws@xmath0 ) with an angular resolution ( @xmath2 ) of @xmath3 .",
    "the momentum resolution ( @xmath4@xmath5 ) is related to the angular resolution by @xmath4@xmath6 where the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons ( @xmath7 ) is dependent on the incident photon energy@xcite .",
    "the samples were cleaved in situ at 150  k in a vacuum better than @xmath8  torr .",
    "the electronic structures of mx@xmath0 ( m = mo or w and x = s , se , or te ) were computed using the projector augmented wave method@xcite as implemented in the vasp@xcite package within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite scheme . a @xmath9 monkhorst - pack k - point mesh was used in the computations .",
    "we used experimental lattice constants and relaxed the atomic positions until the residual forces were less than 0.001  ev /  .",
    "the spin - orbit coupling effects were included self - consistently . in order to correct the energy band gaps , we also performed calculations with the hse hybrid functional@xcite .",
    "single crystals were synthesized using the br@xmath0 vapor transport technique in a two - zone furnace system .",
    "mo , w , and s powders ( purity 99.9995% ) were mixed in stoichiometric ratios in a sealed quartz tube at @xmath10  torr pressure and annealed to @xmath11 for one week to yield precursor powders .",
    "next , they were loaded into 2 inch diameter tubes with br@xmath0 liquid , pumped down to @xmath10  torr , and sealed .",
    "typical growth parameters were established as heat up for one week from room temperature to @xmath12 , the low temperature zone was set to @xmath13 in one day , and the system was kept at this temperature for three weeks and controllably cooled down to room temperature in one week . synthesized crystals displayed strong raman signals at 384  @xmath14 and 407  @xmath14 for mos@xmath0 , and 352  @xmath14 and 417  @xmath14 for ws@xmath0 .",
    "lastly , monolayers exfoliated from mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 crystals displayed sharp bright luminescence peaks at 1.88  ev and 2.04  ev , respectively .",
    "constant energy maps of the electronic band structure of bulk * ( a ) * mos@xmath0 and * ( b ) * ws@xmath0 taken at photon energies of 50  ev and 90  ev , respectively .",
    "the maps were taken at and below the energy corresponding to their respective valence band maximum ( vbm ) at @xmath15 .",
    "the dashed white line indicates the two - dimensional ( reduced in the @xmath16 dimension as shown in the inset ) hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "evolution of the valence band with increase in binding energy about the @xmath17 , @xmath15 , and @xmath18 points can be observed for both samples .",
    "an energy splitting at the @xmath15 and @xmath18 points can be observed in the mos@xmath0 maps , most easily at 170  mev or 260  mev below the vbm ( white arrows ) .",
    "the splitting for ws@xmath0 is not observed 170  mev below the vbm , but can be observed 540  mev below the vbm ( white arrows ) .",

    "[ fig : conste](a ) and [ fig : conste](b ) show detailed momentum - resolved constant - energy maps for bulk mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the two - dimensional ( reduced in the @xmath16 dimension as shown in the inset ) hexagonal brillouin zone is overlaid as white dashed lines .",
    "the observed suppression of intensity in mos@xmath0 along a specific momentum direction near @xmath17 is due presumably to matrix element effects@xcite .",
    "the evolution of the valence band about the @xmath17 , @xmath15 , and @xmath18 points can be clearly observed throughout the range of binding energies shown .",
    "we offset the two sets of data so that the valence band maximum at @xmath15 is shown at the same energy and we compare the two band structures as binding energy is increased .",
    "the two samples produce similar spectra with the most notable difference being the appearance of the lower split valence band at @xmath15 at approximately 170  mev below the local valence band maximum ( vbm ) for mos@xmath0 .",
    "this appears as a small circular feature centered at @xmath15 within a larger concentric feature .",
    "the analogous splitting for ws@xmath0 becomes apparent in the spectra at much higher binding energy , as seen in the map at 540  mev below the vbm .",
    "the splitting for both samples is shown by vertical white arrows .",
    "trigonal warping of the valence band in the vicinity of the @xmath15 and @xmath18 points , similar to that seen in other bulk tmds@xcite , is observed for both samples and presented here for the first time for bulk ws@xmath0 .",
    "this deviation from a circular feature about @xmath15 and @xmath18 is more pronounced at higher binding energies where the feature becomes more triangular .",
    "an analogous trigonal warping has been predicted@xcite to occur in monolayer mos@xmath0 samples as a consequence of the orbital structure of these bands and anisotropic ( order @xmath19 ) corrections to the energy but has not been observed so far in an arpes experiment .    * ( a ) * photon energy dependence from 52 to 120  ev and theoretical calculations of the electronic band structure of bulk ws@xmath0 along the @xmath17@xmath15 high symmetry direction .",
    "the horizontal red ( yellow ) dashed lines correspond to the calculated location of bulk ws@xmath0 bands at the @xmath20 point ( a point ) . observed intensity shifts of the valence band near the @xmath17 point at different binding energies is evidence of strong @xmath16 dispersion . *",
    "( b ) * energy distribution curves ( edcs ) ( solid black lines ) taken along k@xmath21 = k@xmath22 = 0  @xmath23 of the respective maps in ( a ) ( e.g. along the white dashed line in the 52  ev map ) .",
    "the vertical red ( yellow ) dashed lines correspond to the calculated location of bulk ws@xmath0 bands at the @xmath20 point ( a point ) .",
    "the peak in intensity ( denoted by the tick marks ) shifts periodically between higher and lower binding energies as a result of the strong @xmath16 dispersion .",
    "peaks in the 70  ev and 110  ev edcs as well as the top of the feature in the 90  ev edc correspond to the theoretical band maximum at a. ]    to obtain information about the @xmath16 dispersion , i.e. the interlayer dispersion , in figure  [ fig : ws2photdep](a ) we show detailed photon energy dependent maps compared with @xmath16-resolved theoretical calculations of bulk ws@xmath0 along the @xmath17@xmath15 high symmetry direction .",
    "indeed , at normal emission ( @xmath24 ) , @xmath16 is related to the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons ( @xmath25 ) by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the inner potential determined from the measured dispersion@xcite .",
    "near @xmath17 , we observe a broad feature likely associated with the convolution of the various bands predicted for different @xmath16 values as it extends between the two horizontal red dashed lines corresponding to the calculated energies of the top two valence bands at @xmath20 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the top of this broad feature aligns well with the calculated valence band maximum at @xmath20 ( @xmath28 ) for the 52  ev map and as the photon energy is increased further , the top of the feature decreases in energy until it aligns with the calculated valence band maximum at the a point ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) indicated by the horizontal yellow dashed line in the 90  ev map . increasing the photon energy further returns the top of the valence band feature to its maximum value .",
    "the observed @xmath16 dispersion at @xmath17 is investigated more closely in fig .  [",
    "fig : ws2photdep](b ) by comparing energy distribution curves ( edcs ) taken at @xmath17 for each of the incident photon energies ( e.g. along the dashed white line in the 52  ev image in ( a ) ) .",
    "the observation of a large spread in energy of the main peak in the edc spectra between the calculated energies of the top two valence bands at @xmath20 ( vertical red dashed lines ) is in agreement with the association of the broad feature near @xmath17 with the convolution of multiple bands predicted for different @xmath16 values .",
    "the peak intensity ( tick mark ) moves up and down in binding energy in a periodic manner confirming the strong @xmath16 dependence of these bands .",
    "overall , our observed @xmath16 dispersions agree well with other predictions for ws@xmath0@xcite and our calculations which predict wide variation in binding energy ( up to 880  mev ) of the bands as @xmath16 changes from 0 to @xmath31 .",
    "similar @xmath16 dispersions are also found theoretically and experimentally more generally in tmds@xcite .",
    "near @xmath15 , we observe the band splitting at the top of the valence bands for all photon energies , indicating that the splitting occurs for all corresponding @xmath16 values .",
    "we measure the magnitude of the splitting to vary between 414  mev and 441  mev in accordance with our corresponding predicted range of 410  mev ( @xmath30 ) to 466  mev ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this relatively small change in magnitude of the splitting ( 27  mev experimentally and 56  mev theoretically ) across this range of photon energies indicates weak @xmath16 dispersion near @xmath15 and @xmath18 .",
    "this is in contrast to the observation of large variations in the spectra of the broad feature at @xmath17 which indicates strong @xmath16 dispersion of the bands near @xmath17 .    as a result of the layered structure of bulk tmds ,",
    "the three - dimensional character of the band structure is directly related to the strength of the interlayer interaction .",
    "the strong @xmath16 dispersion at @xmath17 is a reflection of the three - dimensional character of those bands .",
    "however , the relatively weak @xmath16 dispersion at @xmath15 and @xmath18 is a reflection of the two - dimensional character of those bands and shows that interlayer interaction has a weak effect on the valence band splitting .",
    "hence , we conclude that the splitting is dominated by spin - orbit coupling with interlayer interaction playing a minor role .",
    "high resolution maps of the electronic band structure of bulk * ( a ) * mos@xmath0 and * ( b ) * ws@xmath0 along the @xmath17@xmath15 high symmetry direction with theoretical calculations overlaid as dashed blue lines . spin - orbit coupling and interlayer interaction induced splitting in the valence band near the @xmath15 point",
    "is fully resolved for both samples as indicated by the white arrows and the respective edcs ( upper insets ) taken along the upper white dashed lines .",
    "[ here the ws@xmath0 edc was integrated in momentum between the two white tick marks . ]",
    "the splitting is found to be approximately 170 @xmath32 2  mev for mos@xmath0 and 425 @xmath32 18  mev for ws@xmath0 .",
    "an additional splitting in a higher binding energy ws@xmath0 valence band is observed within the white dashed rectangle in panel ( b ) .",
    "the lower inset presents an edc taken along the vertical white dashed line corresponding to the energy and momentum location of the maximum splitting of 196 @xmath32 22  mev .",
    "[ here the edc was integrated in momentum between the two white tick marks and smoothed with a savitzky - golay filter . ]",
    "the calculated band structure is found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental band structure for both samples .",
    "the discrepancy in the location of the valence band near the @xmath17 point for bulk mos@xmath0 can be attributed to its strong @xmath16 dispersion . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : energykplot ] shows high - resolution energy versus momentum maps of the band structure of bulk mos@xmath0 ( panel a ) and ws@xmath0 ( panel b ) .",
    "band dispersions can be seen as far as 8  ev below the fermi energy ; many of these bands have not been observed before .",
    "the experimental band structure shows remarkable agreement with our theoretical predictions ( blue dashed lines ) throughout this energy and momentum region .",
    "the intensity of the valence band maximum near @xmath17 for mos@xmath0 is reduced due presumably to matrix element effects@xcite .",
    "additionally , intensity of the experimental bands with low binding energy may be shifted near @xmath17 due to their strong @xmath16 dependence ( as shown for ws@xmath0 in fig .  [",
    "fig : ws2photdep ] ) .",
    "the splitting of the valence band at @xmath15 is fully resolved for both samples ( as indicated by the white arrows ) and is found to be 170 @xmath32 2  mev for mos@xmath0 and 425 @xmath32 18  mev for ws@xmath0 ( as shown in the upper insets ) .",
    "the value for mos@xmath0 agrees well with our experimental constant energy maps presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : conste](a ) as the lower split band for mos@xmath0 appears 170  mev below the higher split band .",
    "the value for ws@xmath0 is consistent with our experimental constant energy maps in fig .",
    "[ fig : conste](b ) as the lower split band is not visible 170  mev below the higher split band , but is clearly visible 540  mev below . these measured magnitudes are smaller by approximately 100  mev than the values of 265  mev for mos@xmath0 and 570  mev for ws@xmath0 predicted by hse - based calculations .",
    "however , our experimental values agree very well with gga - based calculations that predict a splitting of 145 - 224  mev for mos@xmath0 and 410 - 466  mev for ws@xmath0 across all @xmath16 values .",
    "the large difference in magnitude between the splittings for mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 can be explained by the larger intrinsic spin - orbit coupling of tungsten compared with that of molybdenum .",
    "additionally , our calculations predict a substantial splitting of a valence band of ws@xmath0 at high binding energy ( see white dashed rectangle ) .",
    "the maximum splitting predicted is in agreement with the experimental value of 196 @xmath32 22  mev extracted from the edc spectra ( bottom inset ) where two clear peaks can be distinguished .",

    "figure  [ fig : conclusionfig](a ) shows the magnitude of valence band splitting for bulk mos@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 , and other bulk tmds .",
    "the molybdenum- and tungsten - based tmds are ordered separately from left to right with increasing molecular mass . for a given transition metal , the magnitude of the splitting increases as molecular mass increases .",
    "these trends are shown by the dashed lines and can be explained as a consequence of the larger intrinsic spin - orbit coupling of the successively heavier atoms .",
    "the same general trend is obtained from hse hybrid functional calculations ( triangles ) , although the splitting appears to be approximately 100  mev larger .",
    "figure  [ fig : conclusionfig](c ) shows the ratio of out - of - plane to in - plane lattice constant ( @xmath34 ) versus the magnitude of valence band splitting .",
    "similar to the molecular mass trend , we observe that for a given transition metal , the magnitude of splitting increases with increasing @xmath34 ratio ; however , our calculations indicate that although this trend holds across a range of tmds , it does not hold for individual tmds .",
    "in addition to the valence band splitting , the band gap plays a key role when considering tmds for use in spintronics / valleytronics devices .",
    "figure  [ fig : conclusionfig](b ) shows the magnitude of valence band splitting versus band gap ( e@xmath33 ) for bulk mos@xmath0 , ws@xmath0 , and other bulk tmds . for a given transition metal ,",
    "the band gap of bulk tmds decreases with increasing valence band splitting .",
    "the same trend is observed as a function of molecular mass in that the band gap decreases with increasing molecular mass .",
    "again , this trend is seen for both experimental and theoretical data even though the magnitude of the splitting for each tmd is calculated to be approximately 100  mev larger than the corresponding experimental values .",
    "figure  [ fig : conclusionfig](d ) shows the ratio of out - of - plane to in - plane lattice constant versus band gap .",
    "it too follows the same trend as molecular mass and valence band splitting in that the band gap decreases with increasing @xmath34 ratio .",
    "this strong relationship between the band gap , the valence band splitting , and @xmath34 ratio would help guide the search for suitable tmds targeted at specific applications .",
    "we have presented in - depth high - resolution arpes studies of the electronic band structure of bulk mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 together with detailed first - principles computations .",
    "we have shown that the valence band splitting in bulk ws@xmath0 is primarily due to spin - orbit coupling and not interlayer interaction , resolving previous debates on their relative role .",
    "these results strengthen the connection between bulk and monolayer tmds as the splitting in the monolayer limit is due entirely to spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we have shown how the magnitude of this splitting changes for various tmds and how it correlates with molecular mass , @xmath34 ratio , and band gap .",
    "these results provide important new information on how to control these parameters in tmds and for the development of tmd - based devices in the fields of spintronics and valleytronics .",
