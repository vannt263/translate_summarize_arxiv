    "in 1970 donald saari proposed the following conjecture @xcite : _ in the newtonian @xmath0-body problem , if the moment of inertia , @xmath2 , is constant , where @xmath3 represent the position vectors of the bodies of masses @xmath4 , then the corresponding solution is a relative equilibrium_. in other words : newtonian particle systems of constant moment of inertia rotate like rigid bodies .",
    "a lot of energy has been spent to understand saari s conjecture , but most of this work failed to achieve crucial results .",
    "an early attempt at a proof using variational techniques was , unfortunately , incorrect @xcite .",
    "more recently , the interest in this conjecture has grown considerably due to the discovery of the `` figure eight '' solution @xcite , which  as numerical arguments show  has an approximately constant moment of inertia but is not a relative equilibrium .",
    "still , there have been a few successes in the struggle to understand saari s conjecture .",
    "mccord proved that the conjecture is true for three bodies of equal masses @xcite .",
    "llibre and pia gave an alternative proof of this case , but they never published it @xcite .",
    "moeckel obtained a computer - assisted proof for the newtonian three - body problem for any values of the masses @xcite .",
    "diacu , prez - chavela , and santoprete showed that the conjecture is true for any @xmath0 in the collinear case for potentials that depend only on the mutual distances between point masses @xcite .",
    "there have also been results , such as @xcite , which consider the conjecture in other contexts than the newtonian one .    a natural extension of the original saari s conjecture , namely saari s homographic conjecture , was proposed by donald saari during an ams - siam series of cmbs lectures he gave in june 2002 in illinois .",
    "this extended conjecture was then emphasized by donald saari during his talk at the saarifest2005 and in his book @xcite . in this extended conjecture",
    "the role of the moment of inertia is played by the so called configurational measure .    in the newtonian @xmath0-body case @xmath5",
    "defines the configurational measure of the particle system ( also called scaled potential ) , where @xmath6 is the newtonian potential .",
    "saari s homographic conjecture claims that _ every solution of constant configurational measure is homographic _",
    "( see section [ notations ] for more details ) .",
    "in particular , if the moment of inertia is constant , it can be shown that the potential @xmath6 is constant , therefore the configurational measure is constant and every homographic solution with constant moment of inertia is a relative equilibrium .",
    "this reasoning shows why saari s conjecture is a particular case of saari s homographic conjecture .",
    "saari s homographic conjecture covers new territory . while in saari s conjecture collisions",
    "are excluded ( because they lead to an unbounded potential , therefore to a non - constant moment of inertia ) and the motion remains bounded ( because the moment of inertia is constant ) , both collision and unbounded orbits may occur in saari s homographic conjecture .    moreover , saari s homographic conjecture is important for astronomy .",
    "homographic solutions are known to exist in the solar system .",
    "it is often said that the sun , jupiter , and the trojan cluster of asteroids move like a relative equilibrium solution of the three - body problem , but this fact is true only in a first approximation .",
    "jupiter orbits an ellipse around the sun , although this ellipse is almost a circle .",
    "therefore the motion of the system formed by the sun , jupiter , and the trojan asteroids is better described as a homographic solution than as a relative equilibrium of the three - body problem .    in this paper",
    "we are primarily interested in saari s homographic conjecture of three - body problems given by homogeneous potentials , but some of our results are also true for any number @xmath7 of bodies .",
    "the main results of this paper are given in theorems 1 through 8 .",
    "theorem 1 shows that , for homogeneous potentials of order @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , saari s homographic conjecture is true for any total - collision solution of the planar or spatial @xmath0-body problem .",
    "theorem 2 validates saari s homographic conjecture for @xmath10 for any type of collision in the @xmath0-body case .",
    "theorem 3 shows that saari s homographic conjecture is correct in the rectilinear case for @xmath10 .",
    "theorem 4 shows saari s homographic conjecture to be always valid in the collinear case .",
    "theorem 5 proves that , for @xmath10 , saari s homographic conjecture is true in the three - body problem if the solutions stay away from the paths that make them scatter asymptotically towards rectilinear central configurations .",
    "theorem 6 proves that saari s homographic conjecture is correct in the newtonian three - body problem with equal masses and non - negative energy .",
    "theorem 7 shows that for any given initial configuration of three bodies , saari s homographic conjecture is valid if the chosen angular momentum is large enough .",
    "finally , theorem 8 proves that if the angular momentum is chosen first , then saari s homographic conjecture is true if the initial positions are taken close enough to an equilateral triangle of a certain size .",
    "the key tool for obtaining these results is provided by what we call fujiwara coordinates , which were introduced by one of us .",
    "the motivation behind defining them is explained in section [ secdecomposition ] .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section [ notations ] introduces some notations and definitions and gives a precise statement of saari s homographic conjecture .",
    "section [ secevolutionofi ] deals with the evolution of the moment of inertia , which is then used in section [ seccollisionorbit ] to prove theorems 1 , 2 , and 3 .",
    "besides introducing the fujiwara coordinates , section [ secdecomposition ] proves a lemma that characterises the homographic solutions relative to the new fujiwara variables and proves theorem 4 .",
    "section [ kineticsection ] studies the evolution of the triangle s shape formed by three bodies and the connection of this shape with central configurations and homographic solutions . in section [ candidate ]",
    "we characterise the non - homographic solutions that would contradict saari s homographic conjecture .",
    "this characterisation is used in the next sections towards showing that non - homographic solutions are impossible .",
    "section [ condition ] derives a condition that must be satisfied by the non - homographic candidate .",
    "this condition is crucial for proving the other theorems .",
    "sections [ one ] and [ two ] , which prove theorems 5 and 6 , are separated by section [ break ] , whose goal is to study the analytic behaviour of the solutions near rectilinear central configurations .",

    "we use @xmath29 for the _",
    "inner product_.    notice that the moment of inertia , @xmath22 , and the potential , @xmath6 , are homogeneous functions of degree @xmath30 and @xmath8 , respectively , so both functions are inversely proportional in the sense that one increases while the other one decreases .",
    "this observation leads to the notion of _ configurational measure _ , @xmath31 , which is a homogeneous function of degree zero .",
    "a solution of our problem is called _ homographic _ if the configuration of the particles remains similar with itself for all times .",
    "in other words , there exists a scalar @xmath32 and an orthogonal matrix @xmath33 such that , for all t , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is some fixed moment in time .",
    "in particular , a solution is called homothetic if dilation / contraction occurs without rotation .",
    "this situation happens when @xmath36 is the unit matrix .",
    "similarly , a solution is called a relative equilibrium if rotation takes place without dilation / contraction .",
    "this scenario appears when @xmath37 .",

    "[ conjecture1 ] if in the @xmath0-body problem given by a homogeneous potential of degree @xmath8 , with @xmath12 , the configurational measure is constant , then the corresponding solution is homographic .",
    "in this section , we consider the evolution of the moment of inertia for constant configurational measure in the general planar , @xmath38 , or spatial , @xmath39 , @xmath0-body problem .",
    "so , unless otherwise specified , we assume the configurational measure constant , and write @xmath40 the lagrange - jacobi identity yields @xmath41 where @xmath19 is the total energy . in the derivation of this identity we used the fact that @xmath42 integrating the lagrange - jacobi identity for @xmath43 , we obtain @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an integration constant .",
    "let us write @xmath46 then the evolution of the moment of inertia for @xmath47 constant is described by the equation @xmath48 which leads to the first integral @xmath49 notice that the physical region of @xmath50 is @xmath51 because @xmath52 moreover , the constant @xmath45 must be positive or zero . to see this , combine equations ( [ eqintegralfori ] ) and ( [ valueofphi ] ) to obtain @xmath53 the application of the cauchy - schwartz inequality , @xmath54 to the right hand side of equation ( [ 4itminus2b ] ) leads to @xmath55 therefore @xmath56 .",
    "notice that the equality in the cauchy - schwartz inequality ( [ cauchyschwartz ] ) , and therefore the value @xmath57 , take place if and only if there exists a scalar @xmath58 , which may depend on time , such that @xmath59 , a relationship equivalent to @xmath60    we can now prove the following result .

    "this case will be treated in section [ final ] .",
    "in this section , we will show that saari s homographic conjecture is true for orbits that encounter collisions in the future or in the past .",

    "in this section , we introduce some new coordinates , which were proposed by one of us .",

    "indeed , we can easily check that @xmath104 and @xmath105 so in terms of fujiwara coordinates , the moment of inertia and the angular momentum become @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "notice that relative to the coordinates @xmath15 , the particle system is rotating as a whole with angular velocity @xmath108 . in fujiwara",

    "so for the observer , the angular velocity appears to be zero .",

    "then @xmath119 and @xmath120 thus , the fujiwara variables take the form @xmath121 which is constant .",

    "conversely , if @xmath122 , then @xmath123 . so the variables @xmath110 satisfy the relation @xmath124 this implies that the solution is homographic .",
    "using the fact that @xmath125 we get the decomposition of the velocity and the kinetic energy in terms of fujiwara coordinates , @xmath126    @xmath127    to obtain equation ( [ decompositionofkineticenergy ] ) from equation ( [ decompositionofvelocity ] ) , we have used the following `` orthogonality '' relationships between the basis vectors @xmath128 , @xmath100 , and @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and the `` normalisation '' @xmath132 fujiwara coordinates are strictly related to saari s decomposition of velocities @xcite for the @xmath0-body problem . using such decomposition one can express the velocity as a sum of three orthogonal ( at least in the coplanar case ) components , namely @xmath133 , where @xmath134 describes changes in orientation for the system of particles , @xmath135 changes in size , and @xmath136 changes in shape .",
    "equations ( [ decompositionofvelocity ] ) and ( [ decompositionofkineticenergy ] ) are very important because they give the explicit expression of the velocity s decomposition and provide explicit values of the vector s magnitudes .",
    "the geometrical meaning of the coordinates we use here can be expressed in terms of the so called _ shape sphere _ @xcite . if one reduces the configuration space by rotations and translations the three - body problem in the plane has a reduced configuration space isomorphic to @xmath39 .",
    "this reduced space is endowed with a metric , induced from the mass metric on the configuration space , which makes it a cone over a sphere of radius @xmath137 .",
    "this sphere is called the shape sphere and is to be thought of as the space of oriented similarity classes of triangles @xcite .",
    "the coordinates we introduce below are coordinates on the fiber bundle obtained by the following operations : projecting the motion on the shape sphere and then lifting uniquely ( starting from @xmath138 ) the result horizontally , for the connexion defined by the saari s decomposition of velocities , on the fiber bundle whose total space is @xmath139 ( i.e. the configuration space modulo translations ) , base the shape sphere , fiber @xmath140 and projection the quotient by the non trivial similitudes .",
    "the equations of motion expressed in fujiwara variables are @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 .    before closing this section ,",
    "let us give a proof of saari s homographic conjecture in the collinear @xmath0-body case .",
    "any collinear @xmath0-body orbit with non - vanishing angular momentum is homographic .",
    "the proof of this theorem has been given by three of this paper s authors in @xcite for any potential that depends only on the mutual distances .",
    "alternatively , saari also proved this theorem in @xcite . in the context of fujiwara",
    "coordinates , the proof goes as follows .    for collinear motion , we can write that @xmath144 with @xmath145 and @xmath146 . then , @xmath147 @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the imaginary part of the complex number @xmath150 .",
    "therefore @xmath151 so , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 are real . then , in equation ( [ equationofmotionforq0 ] ) with @xmath154 , only one term , @xmath155 is purely imaginary and all the other terms are real . thus @xmath122 .",
    "by lemma [ lammahomographic1 ] , the motion is homographic .    to prove this theorem for any potential that depends only on the mutual distances , as it was shown in @xcite",
    ", it is enough to replace the term @xmath156 in equation ( [ equationofmotionforq0 ] ) with a suitable function that is real for real values of @xmath100 .",
    "in this section , we prove two lemmas that characterise the solutions with @xmath47 constant . then we provide a simple expression of the kinetic energy and obtain the equations of motion that describe shape evolution .    substituting equations ( [ eqintegralfori ] ) and ( [ valueofphi ] ) into equation ( [ decompositionofkineticenergy ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath157 since the left hand side must be non - negative , @xmath45 is non - negative and @xmath158 note that the fact that @xmath159 is nothing but the well known sundman inequality ( see @xcite ) and the cases of equality are known to be homographic motions whose configuration is central @xcite .",
    "we thus have the following result .    [ lammahomographic2 ]",
