    "usual approach in the area of quantum games meyerdavid , ewl , multiplayer , du , cheon , flitney , shimamura , iqbal , ichikawa consists of analyzing a quantum system manoeuvred by participating agents , recognized as players , who possess necessary means for their actions on parts of the system .",
    "the quantum system evolves to its final state and players payoffs , or utilities , mathematically expressed as expectation values of self - adjoint payoff operators , are generated from quantum measurement @xcite .",
    "thus the usual constructions of quantum games involve the concepts of quantum state vectors , entangled states , quantum measurement , expectation values , trace operation , and that of density operators etc .",
    "this may seem normal because as being part of the research field of quantum computation @xcite quantum games are expected to exploit relevant tools from quantum mechanics .",
    "however , in our experience , this noticeable reliance of the models of quantum games on the tools of quantum mechanics also succeeds to keep many readers away from this inter - disciplinary area of research .",
    "ideally , they would like to see genuine quantum games constructed from elementary probabilistic concepts , as it is the case with many examples in game theory @xcite .",
    "we find this situation as an opportunity to present a probabilistic approach in which quantum games are constructed without referring to the tools of quantum mechanics .",
    "while looking for the possibility of such an approach , it is encouraging to find that the most unusual character of quantum mechanics can be expressed in terms of probabilities @xcite only .",
    "for example , bell inequalities @xcite can be written in terms of constraints on joint probabilities relevant to pairs of certain random variables .",
    "as probabilities are central to usual analyses in game theory , it seems natural to use the peculiar probabilities , responsible for the violation of bell inequalities , to construct quantum games .",
    "we , therefore , suggest to construct quantum games from the probabilities arising in the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) experiments @xcite performed to test the violation of bell inequalities .",
    "the most unusual character of the epr probabilities , that they may not be factorizable , motivates us , in this paper , to find how non - factorizability can be used to construct quantum games . in other words , we search for the role of non - factorizable probabilities in game - theoretic solution concepts when epr experiments provide the sets of non - factorizable probabilities .",
    "this explicitly probabilistic approach towards quantum games is expected to be of interest to the readers from such areas as economics @xcite and mathematical biology @xcite , where game theory finds extensive applications and the tools of quantum mechanics are found to be rather alien . secondly , because of its exclusively probabilistic content , this approach promises to provide a unified perspective for both the classical and the quantum games .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ fvbi ] describes the role of factorizability in deriving bell inequality .",
    "section [ tpgfps ] discusses playing two - player games using factorizable probabilities and presents two- and four - coin setups to play the well known games of prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) , stag hunt ( sh ) , and chicken @xcite .",
    "section [ tpgueprs ] describes playing two - player games with epr experiments .",
    "section [ tpgunfps ] develops a framework in which factorizable probabilities lead to the classical game whereas non - factorizable probabilities result in the quantum game .",
    "section discussion discusses the results and presents a view for further work .",
    "factorizability is known to be an interesting property of coupled systems with separated parts , saying @xcite that for such systems the probability for a simultaneous pair of outcomes can be expressed as the product of the probability for each outcome separately .",
    "mathematically , this is expressed by writing joint probabilities as arithmetic product of their respective marginals @xcite .",
    "it turns out to be the most important technical ingredient in the proof of bell inequality .",
    "in fact , j. s. bell used factorizability in his mathematical formulation of locality @xcite . others @xcite have recognized it , for example , by such terms as conditional stochastic dependence .",
    "we describe factorizability with reference to the standard epr setup aspect et al , peres used to derive bell inequality .",
    "this setup consists of two spatially - separated participants , known as alice and bob , who share two - particle systems emitted by the same source .",
    "we specify the state of a coupled system by @xmath0 .",
    "we denote alice s parameter by @xmath1 that can be set either at @xmath2 or at @xmath3 and denote bob s parameter by @xmath4 that can be set either at @xmath5 or at @xmath6 .    in a run ,",
    "alice sets her apparatus either at @xmath2 or at @xmath3 and , in either case , on receiving her particle she makes a measurement , the outcome of which is @xmath7 that is either @xmath8 or @xmath9 . in the same run , bob sets his apparatus either at @xmath10 or at @xmath6 and , in either case , on receiving his particle he makes a measurement , the outcome of which is @xmath11 that can be either @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "alice and bob record the outcomes of their measurements for many runs as they receive two - particle systems emitted from the same source .",
    "we denote the probability that alice obtains the outcome @xmath12 or @xmath13 by @xmath14 and , similarly , we denote the probability that bob obtains the outcome @xmath15 or @xmath9 by @xmath16 .",
    "also , we denote the probability that alice and bob obtain the outcomes @xmath7 and @xmath11 , respectively , by @xmath17 .",
    "these outcomes result from their choices of the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath4 , i.e. which one of the four pairs @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 is realized in a run .    according to quantum theory ,",
    "the outcomes @xmath7 and @xmath11 both are completely random and alice and bob can only find the probabilities to obtain @xmath8 or @xmath9 at the outcomes of their measurements . as it is described in the section [ tpgueprs ] , alice s and bob s parameters @xmath1 and @xmath4 decide these probabilities .    in many runs , alice can choose between @xmath2 or @xmath3 with some probability .",
    "similarly , in many runs , bob can choose between @xmath22 or @xmath6 with some probability .",
    "assume that the source emits a total of @xmath23 two - particle systems .",
    "we denote by @xmath24 the number of times alice gets the outcome @xmath7 when she may set her parameter @xmath1 either at @xmath2 or at @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , we denote by @xmath25 the number of times bob gets the outcome @xmath11 when he may set his parameter @xmath4 either at @xmath26 or at @xmath6 . and",
    ", we denote by @xmath27 the number of times when alice gets the outcome @xmath7 and bob gets the outcome @xmath11 , wherever they may set their parameters @xmath1 and @xmath4 , respectively . when @xmath23 is large , the ensemble probabilities are defined as    @xmath28    for many runs we consider an ensemble of states emitted from the source that may not be the same . to allow mixture of states",
    "we denote the normalized probability density , characterizing the ensemble of emissions , by @xmath29 .",
    "the ensemble probabilities are    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the space of states @xmath0 .",
    "now , factorizability states that    @xmath32    that is , for each @xmath0 the joint probabilities are arithmetic product of their respective marginals .",
    "factorizability being the most important technical ingredient in the proof of bell inequality can be seen as follows .",
    "following inequalities must hold when probabilities are sensible quantities    @xmath33    we now refer to a theorem stating that if six numbers @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 are given such that    @xmath40    then the function @xmath41 is constrained by the inequalities    @xmath42    proof of this theorem can , for example , be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . inequalities ( [ factorizability ( a ) ] ) together with the inequalities ( [ factorizability ( c ) ] ) give    @xmath43    for each @xmath0 .",
    "the central role of factorizability follows as when the definition ( [ factorizability ( mathematical ) ] ) of factorizability holds , the multiplication of ( [ factorizability ( d ) ] ) by @xmath44 and the subsequent integration over @xmath0 gives    @xmath45    which is the bell ( or clauser - horne ) inequality @xcite .",
    "note that the definition ( [ factorizability ( mathematical ) ] ) is crucial in order to obtain the inequality ( [ chsh inequality ] ) .",
    "to bring non - factorizability into the realm of two - player games , we consider a symmetric two - player , two - strategy , non - cooperative game @xcite represented by the matrices    @xmath46    where all @xmath47 are real numbers .",
    "players can go for one of the two available strategies : @xmath48 , @xmath49 for alice and @xmath50 , @xmath51 for bob .",
    "as factorizability is central to obtain bell inequality , in this paper we construct quantum games from non - factorizable probabilities that exploit epr setup .",
    "this rests on fine s view @xcite that the violation of bell inequality in epr experiments shows that quantum theory violates factorizability .",
    "this view allows us to construct quantum games for which factorizability always corresponds to the classical game .",
    "we recognize key features of an epr setup being that these relate to a probabilistic system divided into two parts such that a ) each observer has access to one part of the system b ) each observer can select between two available choices c ) observers can not communicate between themselves d ) observers can make independent selections between the available choices e ) probabilities relevant to each part of the system are normalized and that f ) probabilities are sensible quantities .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the experimental testing of bell inequality involves four correlation experiments that correspond to combining @xmath2 with @xmath5 , @xmath2 with @xmath6 , @xmath3 with @xmath26 , and @xmath3 with @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "these experiments are mutually exclusive in the sense that for any given experiment alice has to select between @xmath2 and @xmath3 and bob has to select between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "that is , alice ( bob ) can not go for @xmath2 @xmath52 and @xmath3 @xmath53 simultaneously because the corresponding observables are incompatible , and can not be measured simultaneously . whereas , in the above derivation of the bell inequality it is assumed that @xmath54 all have definite values which can be measured simultaneously in pairs",
    ".      the above mentioned features are remindful of coins which , if distributed between players , are found to have all the above mentioned properties . for coins factorizability",
    "has a straightforward meaning in that the associated probabilities remain factorizable .",
    "hence , we develop an analysis of two - player games with non - factorizable probabilities by first translating playing of three well known games in terms of the games played when players share coins .",
    "it turns out that a version of this translation provides the right comparison with the probabilities involved in the epr experiments and opens the way to the next step i.e. to introduce non - factorizable probabilities into the playing of two - player games .",
    "we now consider pairs of coins and use it to play a two - player game ( [ a and b matrices ] ) .",
    "for example , this game can be played when each player receives a coin , head up , and ` to flip ' or to ` not to flip ' is a player s strategy .",
    "both coins are then passed to a referee who rewards the players after observing the state of both coins .",
    "assume @xmath2 ( to flip ) and @xmath3 ( not to flip ) are alice s strategies and @xmath5 ( to flip ) and @xmath6 ( not to flip ) are bob s strategies .",
    "that is , with reference to the matrices ( [ a and b matrices ] ) , we make the association @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 . in two - coin setup ,",
    "we assume that the strategies @xmath2 and @xmath5 represent alice s and bob s actions ` to flip ' the coin , respectively ; and , similarly , @xmath3 and @xmath6 represent alice s and bob s actions ` not to flip ' the coin , respectively .    in repeated runs of the game players",
    "can play mixed strategies .",
    "alice s mixed strategy @xmath59 @xmath60 $ ] is the probability to choose @xmath2 over @xmath3 and similarly bob s mixed strategy @xmath61 @xmath60 $ ] is the probability to choose @xmath5 over @xmath6 .",
    "players payoffs are written as    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is for transpose and the subscripts @xmath64 and @xmath65 refer to alice and bob , respectively .",
    "the first and the second entries in a parentheses are alice s and bob s payoffs , respectively .",
    "assume @xmath66 is a nash equilibrium ( ne ) @xcite :    @xmath67    in rest of this paper we will use newhen we refer to either a nash equilibrium or to nash equilibria , assuming that the right meaning can be judged from the context .",
    "we identify this arrangement to play a two - player game using two coins as the _ two - coin setup_.      the game ( [ a and b matrices ] ) can also be played using four coins instead of two .",
    "it is arranged by assigning two coins to each player before the game is played . in a run",
    "each player has to choose one coin .",
    "two coins out of four are , therefore , chosen by the players in each turn .",
    "these coins are then passed to a referee who tosses them together and observes the outcome .",
    "it is assumed that the players do not need to share fair coins .",
    "we recall that in two - coin setup @xmath2 and @xmath5 are alice s and bob s strategies , respectively , that represent players actions ` to flip ' the coin that a player receives in a turn .",
    "instead of flipping or not flipping , in four - coin setup a player s strategy is to choose one out of the two coins that are made available to each player in a turn .",
    "the four - coin setup is relevant as , in a run , choosing a coin out of the two corresponds to choosing one of the two directions in which measurement is performed in standard epr experiment , the outcome of which is @xmath8 or @xmath9 .    in repeated game ,",
    "a player s strategy is defined by the selection she / he makes over several runs of the game .",
    "for example , a player plays a pure strategy when she / he goes for the same coin over all the runs and plays a mixed strategy when she / he finds a probability to choose one coin out of the two over many runs .",
    "referee rewards the players according to their strategies , the underlying statistics of four coins obtained from the outcomes of many tosses each one of which follows every time the two players choose two out of the total four coins , and the matrices ( [ a and b matrices ] ) representing the game being played .",
    "we identify the arrangement using four coins to play a two - player game as the _ four - coin setup_. note that in four - coin setup the players rewards depend on the outcomes of repeated tosses even for pure strategies .",
    "a large number of runs are , therefore , necessary whether a player plays a pure - strategy or a mixed - strategy .",
    "four - coin setup provides an inherently probabilistic character to playing a two - player game and facilitates a probabilistic analysis when we seek to play the game ( [ a and b matrices ] ) using epr experiments .",
    "as the four - coin setup uses a different definition of a strategy relative to the two - coin setup , we call @xmath2 and @xmath3 being alice s coins and @xmath26 and @xmath6 being bob s coins . when selecting a coin",
    "is a player s strategy and we want to play the game given by the matrices ( [ a and b matrices ] ) , it is reasonable to make the association @xmath68 , @xmath56 , and @xmath69 , @xmath57 .",
    "we represent the head of a coin by @xmath8 and its tail by @xmath9 and adapt this convention in the rest of this paper . for coins , alice s outcome of @xmath70 or @xmath9 (",
    "whether she goes for @xmath2 or @xmath3 ) is independent from bob s outcome of @xmath15 or @xmath9 ( whether he goes for @xmath26 or @xmath6 ) and relevant joint probabilities are factorizable .    referring to the definition ( [ factorizability ( mathematical ) ] ) of factorizability and noticing that probabilities associated to coins are factorizable , we use the same notation that is introduced in section fvbi to consider , for example , the probability @xmath71 that can be factorized as @xmath72 .",
    "we define probabilities @xmath73 $ ] by @xmath74 and @xmath75 saying that @xmath76 is the probability of getting head for alice s first coin @xmath2 and @xmath77 is the probability of getting head for bob s first coin @xmath5 .",
    "factorizability then allows us to write @xmath78 and @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 i.e. @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the probabilities of getting head for alice s and bob s second coin , respectively .    in four - coin setup",
    "we find it useful to have the following table :    @xmath84    from which we define payoff relations for the players :    @xmath85    where    @xmath86    for example , @xmath87 is alice s payoff when , in repeated runs of coin tossing , she always goes for her first coin , i.e. @xmath88 , while bob goes for his second coin , i.e. @xmath89 .",
    "as it is the case with two - coin setup , alice s mixed strategy in four - coin setup is the probability with which she chooses her pure strategy @xmath2 over her other pure strategy @xmath3 during repeated runs of the experiment .",

    "pd is known to be a representative of the problems of social cooperation @xcite  and has been one of the earliest @xcite and favorite topics for quantum games .",
    "hence it is worthwhile to analyze this game in the setup using non - factorizable probabilities .",

    ", a separate set of constraints is found for each ne .",
    "it seems that the four - coin setup is the minimal arrangement that allows one to introduce , in a smooth way , the epr probabilities into a game - like setting .",

    "that the usual approach uses entangled states to construct quantum games and this paper uses non - factorizability to the same end .",
    "mathematically , non - factorizability comes out to be a stronger condition than the condition that translates entanglement into constraints on joint probabilities .",

    "for example , in case of singlet state the outcomes of two measurements violate bell inequality only along certain directions , and not along other directions .",
    "in other words , in a quantum game exploiting entangled states , the joint probabilities may still be factorizable but for a quantum game , resulting from non - factorizable probabilities , bell inequality is bound to be violated .",
    "non - factorizability being a stronger condition may well be suggested as the reason why it can not be helpful to escape from the classical outcome in pd .",
    "the proposed setup demonstrates how non - factorizability can change outcome of a game .",
    "we suggest to extend @xcite this setup to analyze multi - player quantum games @xcite where players share physical systems for which joint probabilities can not be factorized .",
