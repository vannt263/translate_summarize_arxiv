    "there is currently a great interest on new measures of quantum correlations for mixed states , different from the entanglement measures @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement is essential for quantum teleportation @xcite and also for pure state quantum computation , where its increase with system size is necessary to achieve an exponential speedup over classical computation @xcite .",
    "however , the computation model proposed by knill and laflamme @xcite has shown that for mixed states , such speedup can in principle be achieved without entanglement @xcite .",
    "this suggests the subsistence of useful quantum correlations in some separable mixed states , which , we recall , are defined as convex mixtures of product states @xcite . while a separable pure state is a product state ,",
    "separable mixed states comprise product states , mixtures of commuting products and also mixtures of non - commuting product states .",
    "the latter can possess entangled eigenstates and give rise to non - classical capabilities .",
    "consequently , measures such as the quantum discord @xcite have recently received much attention .",
    "while coinciding with the entanglement entropy for pure states , the quantum discord is non - zero for separable mixed states of the last type , vanishing just for classically or one - way classically correlated states , i.e. , states diagonal in a standard or conditional product basis .",
    "the circuit of @xcite was in fact shown in @xcite to exhibit a non - negligible discord .",
    "other measures with similar properties include the one - way information deficit @xcite , the geometric discord @xcite , based on the standard hilbert - schmidt norm , and the general entropic measures which we defined in @xcite , based on generalized entropic forms . the latter contain the two previous measures as particular cases , embedding them in a unified picture .",
    "since they are applicable with entropic forms complying with minimum requirements , they offer , like the geometric discord , the possibility of easier evaluations , allowing at the same time to identify some universal features exhibited by all these measures @xcite . related generalized measures vanishing just for full classically correlated states , like those of @xcite and @xcite , were also considered @xcite .",
    "let us remark that important quantum capabilities of separable states with non - zero discord , and hence non - zero values of the previous measures , were recently unveiled @xcite .",
    "other relevant properties of the quantum discord and its evaluation in specific states and scenarios were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze the explicit evaluation of the generalized measures of @xcite in some important general cases .",
    "we first provide in sec .",
    "[ ii ] the general stationary condition that the least disturbing local measurement should satisfy , including conditions for its independence from the entropy employed ( universality ) , together with its explicit form for general two - qubit states .",
    "here we show that in addition to the quadratic case ( geometric discord ) , the measure based on a cubic function of the density matrix ( `` cubic '' discord ) can also be exactly evaluated for any state of two qubits .",
    "moreover , for two - qubit states this measure shares with the geometric discord the same pure state limit , where they are both proportional to the square of the concurrence @xcite . as specific applications , we provide in sec .",
    "[ iii ] the general expression for two - qubit states with maximally mixed reduced states , valid for any entropic form , analyzing its main features .",
    "we also examine their evaluation in the so - called @xmath0 states @xcite , where explicit expressions for the quadratic and cubic cases are provided , and for the important case of a mixture of two aligned states @xcite , which represents in particular the exact state of a pair in the ground state of a finite @xmath1 ferromagnetic spin @xmath2 chain in the vicinity of the factorizing field @xcite .",

    "the loss of information due to such measurement , i.e. , the information contained in the off - diagonal elements of the original @xmath4 in the previous basis , can be quantified by the quantity @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes a generalized entropy of the form @xmath19 with @xmath20\\rightarrow\\re$ ] a smooth strictly concave function ( @xmath21 for @xmath22 ) satisfying @xmath23 @xcite .",

    "such quantity is a measure of the quantum correlations lost in the local measurement , and reduces to the information deficit and the geometric discord when @xmath30 is chosen as the von neumann and linear entropy respectively .",
    "a general stationary condition was derived , together with its explicit form for an arbitrary mixed state of two qubits .",
    "explicit expressions for the cubic entropy and the associated measure @xmath241 were in this case obtained , which require , as in the quadratic case ( geometric discord ) , just the eigenvalues of a @xmath429 matrix .",
    "as application , we have first examined two - qubit mixed states with maximally mixed marginals , where the minimum information loss @xmath106 for any entropy was shown to be a simple function of the eigenvalues of @xmath4 .",
    "the minimizing measurement is in this case universal .",
    "moreover , in this case @xmath52 and @xmath241 were shown to be strict upper bounds of the squared concurrence , which is the associated entanglement monotone for both entropies .",
    "we have also analyzed the case of @xmath0 states , providing explicit expressions for @xmath52 and @xmath241 and showing that spin measurements along the principal axes of the matrix @xmath163 are _ universal _ stationary points of @xmath106 for _ any _ @xmath30 .",
    "finally , the special case of a mixture of aligned states was examined in detail . here the least disturbing local measurement changes , for all measures @xmath30 , from @xmath243 ( bisector axis ) to the @xmath353 axis as the angle @xmath430 between both directions changes from @xmath164 to @xmath289 , being then different from that optimizing the original quantum discord ( which stays constant ) , although the type of transition depends on the information measure employed .",
    "the least disturbing measurement according to @xmath106 is thus more sensible to the strength of the correlation , and reflects the `` transition '' experienced by the state .",
