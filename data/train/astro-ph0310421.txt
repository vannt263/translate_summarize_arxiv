    "it is now well established that four light isotopes , d , @xmath16he , @xmath17he and @xmath18li , were produced by nuclear reactions within the first few minutes after the birth of the universe @xcite . in the standard theory of big bang nucleosynthesis ( sbbn ) ,",
    "given the number of light neutrino species @xmath19 = 3 , the abundances of these light elements depend on one cosmological parameter only , the baryon - to - photon number ratio @xmath20 , which in turn is directly related to the density of ordinary baryonic matter @xmath21 @xcite , where @xmath13 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 .",
    "thus precise abundance measurements of the four light elements can provide not only a stringest test of the consistency of sbbn , but also information about the mean density of ordinary matter in the universe .",
    "deuterium is the best element for deriving the baryonic mass fraction because its abundance is strongly dependent on @xmath20 .",
    "much progress has been achieved during the last years in the precise measurement of the deuterium abundance in high - redshift low - metallicity ly@xmath22 absorption systems @xcite .",
    "these measurements appear to converge to the mean value d / h @xmath23 3 @xmath24 10@xmath25 which corresponds to @xmath21 @xmath23 0.020 @xmath8 0.002 .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the ones of 0.021  0.022 from recent studies of the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "determining the primordial abundance of @xmath16he is more difficult .",
    "not only it is destroyed in stars , but it can also be produced by low - mass stars .",
    "thus the derivation of its primordial value is complicated by our lack of understanding of both the chemical evolution of the galaxy and the production of @xmath16he in stars . however , recently @xcite determined an upper limit for the primordial abundance of @xmath16he relative to hydrogen @xmath16he / h = ( 1.1 @xmath8 0.2 ) @xmath24 10@xmath25 by arguing that most solar - mass stars do not produce enough @xmath16he to enrich the interstellar medium significantly .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath21 @xmath23 0.020@xmath26 , in excellent agreement with the value obtained from the deuterium and cmb measurements .",
    "as for the primordial abundance of @xmath18li , possible correlations of its value with temperature and metallicity in old hot population ii stars may introduce systematic errors .",
    "the value for the @xmath18li primordial abundance derived from the @xmath18li abundance plateau of halo stars by @xcite is @xmath18li / h = ( 1.75@xmath80.05@xmath27@xmath80.20@xmath28)@xmath2410@xmath29 , corresponding to two possible values for the baryonic density @xmath21 = 0.006 and @xmath21 = 0.015 , below the value derived from the d abundance and cmb measurements .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found a correlation of the @xmath18li abundance with the metallicity of halo stars , and inferred @xmath18li / h = 1.0 @xmath24 10@xmath29 corresponding to a single value of @xmath21 = 0.009 , while @xcite find @xmath18li / h = 1.23@xmath30 @xmath24 10@xmath29 , significantly below the value of 4.5@xmath31 @xmath24 10@xmath29 , predicted by sbbn from the primordial d abundance @xcite .",
    "however , recently @xcite has shown that the @xmath18li abundance derived in stars depends on the li i line used . from the weak li",
    "i @xmath326104 subordinate line instead of the commonly used li i @xmath326708 resonance line , they derived a much higher @xmath18li abundance of @xmath23 3 @xmath24 10@xmath29 , consistent with the sbbn predicted value .",
    "the primordial mass fraction @xmath0 of @xmath17he can be derived with a much better precision compared to the primordial abundances of other light elements .",
    "@xmath0 is usually derived by extrapolating the @xmath2  o / h and @xmath2 ",
    "n / h correlations to o / h = n / h = 0 , as proposed originally by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "many attempts at determining @xmath0 have been made , constructing these correlations for various samples of dwarf irregular and blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) ( see references in @xcite , hereafter it98 ) .",
    "these dwarf systems are the least chemically evolved galaxies known , so they contain very little helium manufactured by stars after the big bang , allowing us to bypass the chemical evolution problems which plague the determination of @xmath16he .",
    "however , because the big - bang production of @xmath17he is relatively insensitive to the density of baryonic matter , the primordial abundance of @xmath17he needs to be determined to a very high precision ( to better than 1% ) in order to put useful constraints on @xmath10 and @xmath19 .",
    "uncertainties in the determination of @xmath0 can be statistical or systematic .",
    "statistical uncertainties can be decreased by obtaining very high signal - to - noise ratio spectra of bcgs .",
    "these bcgs are undergoing intense bursts of star formation , giving birth to high excitation supergiant h ii regions and allowing an accurate determination of the helium abundance in the ionized gas through the bcg emission - line spectra .",
    "the theory of nebular emission is well - understood enough not to introduce additional uncertainty .",
    "care should also be exercised to consider all possible systematic effects .",
    "we have considered several systematic effects in our previous primordial helium work .",
    "first , we have solved consistently for the electron density @xmath33(he ii ) in the he@xmath7 zone rather than just setting it to @xmath33(s ii ) as was done by previous investigators .",
    "second , we have corrected the he i emission lines for collisional and fluorescent enhancements . with those systematic effects taken into account , @xcite ( hereafter itl97 ) , by fitting linear regression lines to the @xmath2  o / h and @xmath2 ",
    "n / h correlations for a sample of 23 bcgs , have derived @xmath0 = 0.243 @xmath8 0.003 .",
    "it98 by extending that sample to 45 h ii regions in 41 bcgs have obtained 0.244 @xmath8 0.002 .",
    "these values are significantly higher than those of 0.228  0.234 obtained by @xcite and @xcite with lower signal - to - noise ratio spectra , by setting @xmath33(he ii ) = @xmath33(s ii ) and not taking into account fluorescent enhancements of the he i lines .",
    "we have also determined @xmath2 in individual very metal - deficient bcgs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite have respectively derived the helium abundance in the bcgs i zw 18 ( @xmath3/50 ) , sbs 0335052 ( @xmath3/40 ) , sbs 0940 + 544 ( @xmath3/29 ) , tol 1214277 ( @xmath3/24 ) , tol 65 ( @xmath3/24 ) and sbs 1415 + 437 ( @xmath3/21 ) , using high signal - to - noise ratio spectra obtained with the mmt and the keck telescope .",
    "except for i zw 18 , these determinations have all resulted in a @xmath17he mass fraction in the narrow range @xmath2 = 0.245  0.246 .",
    "the helium mass fraction for the se component of i zw 18 , @xmath2 = 0.243 , is lower because of the contribution of underlying stellar he i absorption @xcite . using the two most metal - deficient bcgs known , i zw 18 and sbs 0335052 , @xcite derived a primordial helium mass fraction @xmath0 = 0.245 @xmath8 0.002",
    ".    however , there are other systematic effects which may either increase or decrease @xmath0 , that were not taken into account in our previous work .",
    "first , there is the possible systematic effect of underlying he i stellar absorption ( itl97 , it98 ) .",
    "correction for this increases @xmath2 in the galaxy .",
    "in particular , he i stellar absorption is important in i zw 18 @xcite . because it has the lowest metallicity known , i zw 18 plays an important role in the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "the lower @xmath0 derived by other groups @xcite is largely the result of neglecting underlying he i stellar absorption in i zw 18 . a second possible systematic effect is the collisional excitation of hydrogen lines @xcite .",
    "correction for this effect also increases @xmath2 .",
    "the third systematic effect concerns the temperature structure of the h ii region .",
    "the electron temperature of the he@xmath7 zone @xmath6(he ii ) is usually set equal to the temperature @xmath6(o iii ) derived from the collisionally excited [ o iii ] emission lines .",
    "recent work has shown that @xmath6(he ii ) may be smaller than @xmath6(o iii ) @xcite .",
    "correction for this effect decreases @xmath2 .",
    "a last systematic effect concerns the ionization structure of the h ii region . the he@xmath7 zone can be larger or smaller than the h@xmath7 zone . therefore , an ionization correction factor @xmath34(he ) should be applied . in high excitation low - metallicity h ii regions ,",
    "the ionization correction factor @xmath34(he ) may be slightly higher or lower than unity @xcite .",
    "these different systematic effects work in opposite directions and it is a priori not clear whether combining all of them would increase or decrease @xmath0 .",
    "preliminary estimates by @xcite suggest that , after correction for all the systematic effects mentioned above , @xmath0 may increase by as much as @xmath2324% .",
    "besides the @xmath0 problem , there is also a need to improve the accuracy of the determination of the slope @xmath1 from the @xmath2  o / h linear regression . itl97 and it98 have derived @xmath1 = 1.7 @xmath8 0.9 and 2.4 @xmath8 1.0 respectively .",
    "these values are in agreement , within the errors , with the slope @xmath1= 2.1 @xmath8 0.4 derived by @xcite using k dwarf stars with accurate spectroscopic metallicities in the _ hipparcos _ catalog , and with the slope @xmath1= 1.5 @xmath8 0.3 derived by @xcite from observations of two relatively metal - rich h ii regions , 30 dor and ngc 346 .",
    "they are also in agreement with the values predicted by chemical evolution models of dwarf galaxies @xcite , although the errors on @xmath1 are still large and do not allow to strongly constrain these models .",
    "the reason for this state of affair is that , for the @xmath0 problem , attention has been paid mainly to very low metallicity bcgs . for example",
    ", the sample of it98 contains very few intermediate - metallicity bcgs .",
    "we address the two problems of systematic effects on the determination of @xmath0 and of improving the accuracy of @xmath1 in this paper .",
    "to obtain a more accurate @xmath1 , we have added to our sample 31 new bcgs spanning a considerably wider range of oxygen abundance , resulting in a total sample of 76 bcgs with 82 h ii regions . to take into account systematic effects on the determination of @xmath0 ,",
    "we have studied them in detail in a subsample of 7 h ii regions and then have applied the net correction to the total sample of 82 h ii regions to derive the primordial helium abundance .",
    "we describe the sample , observations and data reduction in  2 . in ",
    "3 we determine the physical conditions and heavy element abundances for all 82 h ii regions in the total sample .",
    "helium abundances are derived in  4 . in  5 , we present our new best values for @xmath0 and for the linear regression slope @xmath1 which has considerably reduced errors . in  3 , 4 and 5 , to compare the @xmath0 derived from our new increased sample of 82 h ii regions with our previous @xmath0 determinations from smaller samples ( itl97 , it98 ) ,",
    "we have proceeded in the same manner as in our previous work concerning systematic effects .",
    "we have determined self - consistently @xmath33(he ii ) and corrected the he i line fluxes for collisional and fluorescent enhancements . to estimate the net change incurred by @xmath0",
    "if all known systematic effects are taken into account , we have analyzed a restricted subsample of 7 h ii regions .",
    "we apply the correction derived from the restricted sample to the whole sample and present our best value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 corrected for systematic effects in  6 .",
    "the implications of our results on cosmology are discussed in  7 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in  8 .",
    "we have obtained new high signal - to - noise ratio spectrophotometric observations for 33 h ii regions in 31 bcgs with the kitt peak 4-meter telescope on the nights of 2002 december 30  31 and 2003 january 1 .",
    "the majority of the galaxies were selected from the first byurakan ( markarian ) @xcite , the university of michigan @xcite and hamburg / sao @xcite objective prism surveys . in choosing the candidates , we have used two main selection criteria .",
    "first , they need to have high equivalent widths ( ew ) of the h@xmath35 emission line ( in general , ew(h@xmath35 ) @xmath36 200 ) to minimize the influence of underlying he absorption on the he abundance determination .",
    "second , they are to span a wide range of metallicities , from @xmath23 @xmath3/50 to @xmath23 @xmath3/3 , so as to allow an improved determination of @xmath1 .",
    "the observed galaxies are listed in table [ tab1 ] in order of increasing right ascension , along with some of their general properties such as coordinates , apparent magnitudes , redshifts and absolute magnitudes .",
    "relevant references are also given .",
    "all observations were made with the ritchey - chrtien spectrograph used in conjunction with the 2048@xmath242048 ccd detector .",
    "we use a 2@xmath37@xmath24300@xmath37 slit with the grating kpc-10a in first order , and with a gg 375 order separation filter .",
    "this filter cuts off all second - order contamination for wavelengths blueward of 7400 , which is the wavelength region of interest here .",
    "the above instrumental set - up gave a spatial scale along the slit of 069 pixel@xmath14 , a scale perpendicular to the slit of 2.7  pixel@xmath14 , a spectral range of 35007500  and a spectral resolution of @xmath23 7  ( fwhm ) .",
    "these parameters permitted to cover simultaneously the blue and red spectral range with all the lines of interest in a single exposure and with enough spectral resolution to separate important emission lines as h@xmath38  @xmath324340 and [ o iii ] @xmath324363 , and h@xmath22  @xmath326563 and [ n ii ] @xmath326584 .",
    "the seeing was in the range 12 .",
    "total exposure times varied between 20 and 60 minutes .",
    "each exposure was broken up into 24 subexposures , not exceeding 20 minutes , to allow for removal of cosmic rays .",
    "three kitt peak irs spectroscopic standard stars feige 110 , feige 34 and hz 44 were observed at the beginning , middle and end of each night for flux calibration .",
    "spectra of he  ne  ar comparison arcs were obtained before or after each observation to calibrate the wavelength scale .",
    "the log of the observations is given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra were bias subtracted and flat - field corrected using iraf .",
    "we then use the iraf software routines identify , reidentify , fitcoord , transform to perform wavelength calibration and correct for distortion and tilt for each frame .",
    "one - dimensional spectra were then extracted from each frame using the apall routine . before extraction , distinct two - dimensional spectra of the same h ii region",
    "were carefully aligned using the spatial locations of the brightest part in each spectrum , so that spectra were extracted at the same positions in all subexposures .",
    "for all objects we extracted the brightest part of the bcg , corresponding to a different spatial size for each object . in two bcgs ,",
    "cgcg 007025 and mrk 450 , spectra of two different h ii regions in the same galaxy were extracted .",
    "the extraction apertures of the one - dimensional spectra used for abundance determinations are given in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "these spectra have been corrected for the night sky absorption bands in the red part using spectra of the standard star feige 34 which contains no absorption lines in that part of the spectrum .",
    "all extracted spectra from the same object were then co - added . to perform the co - adding and removal of the cosmic - ray hits , the imcombine routine",
    "is generally used .",
    "however , the use of the imcombine routine can introduce spurious changes in the line intensities of sharp narrow emission lines when small spatial shifts are still present . in those cases ,",
    "we have simply summed the individual subexposures .",
    "cosmic rays hits have been manually removed in each individual subexposure .",
    "then spectra obtained from each individual subexposure were checked for cosmic rays hits at the location of strong emission lines .",
    "fortunately , none of them were found .",
    "particular attention was paid to the derivation of the sensitivity curve .",
    "it is crucial that the latter be obtained with a very high accuracy for a precise primordial helium abundance determination . to derive the sensitivity curve ,",
    "we have fitted with a high - order polynomial the observed spectral energy distribution of the bright hot white dwarf standard stars feige 110 , feige 34 and hz 44 . because the spectra of these stars have only a small number of a relatively weak absorption features , their spectral energy distributions are known with very good accuracy @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the response function of the ccd detector is smooth , so we could derive a sensitivity curve with a precision better than 1% over the whole optical range , except for the region blueward of [ o ii ] @xmath323727 where the sensitivity drops precipitously .",
    "the resulting spectra for all 33 h ii regions are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "these spectra have been reduced to zero redshift and corrected for interstellar extinction .    as a whole ,",
    "the h ii regions in our new bcg sample show high excitation spectra , except for mrk 1063 .",
    "nineteen h ii regions have a h@xmath35 equivalent width greater than 200 .",
    "the observed line fluxes @xmath39(@xmath32 ) normalized to @xmath39(h@xmath35 ) and their errors for the 33 h ii regions shown in figure [ fig1 ] are given in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "they were measured using the iraf splot routine .",
    "the line flux errors listed include statistical errors derived with splot from non - flux calibrated spectra , in addition to errors introduced in the standard star absolute flux calibration , which we set to 1% of the line fluxes .",
    "these errors will be later propagated into the calculation of abundance errors .",
    "the line fluxes were corrected for both reddening @xcite and underlying hydrogen stellar absorption derived simultaneously by an iterative procedure as described in @xcite ( hereafter itl94 ) . the corrected line fluxes @xmath40(@xmath32)/@xmath40(h@xmath35 ) , equivalent widths ew(@xmath32 ) , extinction coefficients @xmath41(h@xmath35 ) , and equivalent widths ew(abs ) of the hydrogen absorption stellar lines are also given in table [ tab3 ] , along with the uncorrected h@xmath35 fluxes .",
    "to determine element abundances , we follow the procedures of itl94 , itl97 and @xcite .",
    "we adopt a two - zone photoionized h ii region model : a high - ionization zone with temperature @xmath6(o iii ) , where o iii , ne iii and ar iv lines originate , and a low - ionization zone with temperature @xmath6(o ii ) , where o ii , n ii , s ii and fe iii lines originate . as for the ar iii and s iii lines",
    "they originate in the intermediate zone between the high and low - ionization regions @xcite .",
    "we have derived the chlorine abundance from cl iii emission lines in 22 h ii regions .",
    "we assume that these lines also originate in the intermediate zone as the ionization potentials of the s@xmath42 , ar@xmath42 and cl@xmath42 ions are similar . the temperature @xmath6(o iii )",
    "is calculated using the [ o iii ] @xmath324363/(@xmath324959+@xmath325007 ) ratio . to take into account the electron temperatures for different ions , we have used the h ii photoionization models of @xcite , as fitted by the expressions in itl94 and itl97 .",
    "the [ s ii ] @xmath326717/@xmath326731 ratio is used to determine the electron density @xmath33(s ii ) , the minimum value of which was set to be 10 @xmath43 .",
    "ionic and total heavy element abundances are derived for the 33 h ii regions in the manner described in itl94 and are given in table [ tab4 ] along with the adopted ionization correction factors ( @xmath34 ) .    as a result of our sample selection criteria , the oxygen abundances in the newly observed h ii",
    "regions span a wide range of metallicities , going from 12 + log ( o / h ) = 7.43 ( @xmath3/30 , j 0519 + 0007 ) to 8.30 ( @xmath3/4 , mrk 35 ) with a large fraction of high - metallicity galaxies .",
    "five galaxies among those observed have 12 + log ( o / h ) @xmath36 8.2 ( @xmath3/5 ) .",
    "this large metallicity range is crucial for determining an accurate @xmath1 slope .",
    "because the @xmath0  @xmath20 relation has a very shallow slope , @xmath0 has to be determined to better than 1% in order to put interesting constraints on the baryonic mass fraction of the universe . in principle",
    ", this high precision can be achieved if care is taken to : 1 ) obtain spectra of low - metallicity h ii regions with the very highest signal - to - noise ratio ; 2 ) take into account all physical processes which may make he i line intensities deviate from their recombination values such as collisional and fluorescence enhancements ; 3 ) use the best possible atomic data ; and 4 ) take into account systematic effects in the determination of the helium mass fraction , such as underlying stellar absorption , the ionization and temperature structures of the h ii region .    in this section , to compare the results from the present enlarged sample with our previous work , we derive @xmath0 in the same way as itl94 , itl97 and it98 .",
    "we solve self - consistently for @xmath33(he ii ) and the optical depth @xmath44(@xmath323889 ) in the he i @xmath323889 emission line , but do not consider possible temperature and ionization structures in the h ii regions .",
    "thus , we set the temperature in the he@xmath7 zone to be equal to that derived from the [ o iii ] @xmath324363/(@xmath324959 + @xmath325007 ) flux ratio , i.e. @xmath6(he ii ) = @xmath6(o iii ) .",
    "the case where @xmath6(he ii ) @xmath4 @xmath6(o iii ) will be discussed in  6 for a subsample of 7 h ii regions .",
    "the he ionization correction factors are set to 1 .",
    "we consider collisional and fluorescence enhancement effects but do not take into account other systematic effects such as the collisional excitation of hydrogen lines and underlying he i stellar absorption .",
    "these effects will be discussed in  6 as well .    because observed he i",
    "fluxes deviate from their recombination values , corrections are necessary to take into account the physical mechanisms which modify line fluxes . in the range of high temperatures found in bcgs ( 10@xmath17k @xmath45 @xmath6 @xmath45 2@xmath2410@xmath17k ) , the main such physical mechanism is collisional excitation from the metastable 2@xmath16s level of he i. the second physical mechanism to consider is fluorescence enhancement where self - absorption in some optically thick emission lines populates the upper levels of he i. to correct line intensities for these effects we have evaluated the electron number density @xmath33(he ii ) and the optical depth @xmath44(@xmath323889 ) in the he i @xmath323889 line in a self - consistent way by minimization of the expression @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the he@xmath7 abundance derived from the flux of the he i emission line with label @xmath48 .",

    "following itl94 , itl97 and it98 we use the five strongest he i @xmath323889 , @xmath324471 , @xmath325876 , @xmath326678 and @xmath327065 emission lines to derive @xmath33(he ii ) and @xmath44(@xmath323889 ) , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    "the he i @xmath323889 and @xmath327065 lines play an important role because they are particularly sensitive to both quantities .",
    "since the he i @xmath323889 line is blended with the h8 @xmath323889 line , we have subtracted the latter , assuming its intensity to be equal to 0.107 @xmath40(h@xmath35 ) @xcite .",

    "they give simple and convenient fits for calculations of abundances for different he i emission lines .",
    "these authors also show that some of the correction factors used by itl97 may be in error by a factor of @xmath232 , especially for he i @xmath327065 emission line , which may lead to an overestimation of @xmath0 .",

    "it has long been recognized @xcite that absorption caused by hot stars in the he i lines can decrease the intensities of the nebular he i lines . in particular , @xcite have shown that the neglect of he i underlying stellar absorption has led to the derivation of a very low helium mass fraction in i zw 18 , the most metal - deficient bcg known @xcite .",
    "this effect is most pronounced for the he i @xmath324471 emission line .",
    "recently , @xcite have produced synthetic spectra of h balmer and he i absorption lines in starburst and poststarburst galaxies .",

    "it was generally assumed in abundance studies that deviations of the observed h@xmath22/h@xmath35 flux ratio from the theoretical recombination value are entirely due to interstellar extinction .",
    "@xcite first noted that in the hot and dense h ii regions of bcgs , collisional excitation of hydrogen emission lines can be important .",
    "this can affect the derived h abundances and hence the he abundances since the latter are always derived relative to h abundances .",
    "@xcite estimated that this effect can result in an upward correction in the he abundances of up to 5% , assuming that the excess of the h@xmath22/h@xmath35 flux ratio above the theoretical recombination value is due only to collisional excitation .",

    "to derive the he abundances , itl94 , itl97 and it98 have assumed that the temperatures @xmath6(he ii ) and @xmath6(o iii ) averaged over the whole h ii region are equal .",
    "@xmath6(o iii ) is determined from the observed [ o iii]@xmath324363/(@xmath324959 + @xmath325007 ) emission line flux ratio . however , because of the high sensitivity of the flux of the auroral [ o iii]@xmath324363 emission line to temperature , @xmath6(o iii ) tends to be characteristic of the hotter zones in the h ii region , and it is generally higher than @xmath6(he ii ) . to take into account the difference of the calculated electron temperature @xmath6(o iii ) as compared to the one in the h@xmath72 and he@xmath72 zones",

    "this approach has been applied by @xcite for the determination of the he abundance in some low - metallicity dwarf galaxies , including the two most - metal deficient bcgs known , i zw 18 and sbs 0335052 . using the observations of @xcite they find that the difference between @xmath6(o iii ) and @xmath6(he ii ) results in a reduction of the he mass fraction by 2  3 percent as compared to the case when @xmath6(o iii ) = @xmath6(he ii ) .",
    "another source of systematic uncertainties comes from the assumption that the h@xmath7 and he@xmath7 zones in the h ii region are coincident .",
    "however , depending on the hardness of the ionizing radiation , the radius of the he@xmath7 zone can be smaller than the radius of the h@xmath7 zone in the case of soft ionizing radiation , or larger in the case of hard radiation . in the former case ,",
    "a correction for unseen neutral helium should be made , resulting in an ionization correction factor @xmath34(he ) @xmath36 1 and hence a higher helium abundance . in the latter case ,",
    "the situation is opposite and @xmath34(he ) @xmath76 1 .",
    "the ionization correction factor problem has been discussed in several studies @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the correction of the helium abundance can be as high as several percent in either downward or upward directions depending on the hardness of the radiation and the ionization parameter @xmath77 . @xcite",
    "have calculated an extensive grid of photoionized h ii region models aiming to derive the correction factors as functions of hardness and @xmath77 .",
    "their conclusion was that a downward correction of @xmath2 by as much as 6% and 2% is required respectively for ionization parameters log @xmath77 = 3.0 and 2.5 .",
    "however , the downward correction is @xmath45 1% if log @xmath77 @xmath78 2.0 , which is the case for the majority of our h ii regions .",

    "second , they adopt the equivalent widths of the h i and he i absorption lines calculated by @xcite for a particular age of the star formation burst in each h ii region , except for ngc 346 where the equivalent widths of absorption lines were set to zero . no correction for underlying stellar absorption",
    "was applied to the strong he i @xmath325876 , @xmath326678 and @xmath327065 emission lines .",
    "these lines play an important role in the helium abundance determination , but their absorption equivalent widths were not calculated by @xcite .",

    "i zw 18 and sbs 0335052 , @xcite derive , after correction for all systematic effects , helium abundances very close to the values obtained when systematic effects other than collisional and fluorescent enhancements are not taken into account .",

    "we have added two more metal - rich galaxies mrk 450 ( this paper ) and um 311 ( it98 ) to improve the metallicity range and obtain a more accurate determination of @xmath1 . however ,",
    "our approach is somewhat different from that of @xcite .    instead of using cloudy to derive model parameters",

    "@xmath325876 , @xmath326678 and @xmath327065 and correct for systematic effects in such a way so as to obtain after correction the best agreement between the he abundances derived from each he i line separately , i.e. we search for the minimum @xmath62 as defined by eq .

    "these values should be well determined as we have only four unknowns for five constraints , i.e. the problem is overdetermined .",
    "we proceed in the following manner .",
    "we first correct for collisional excitation of the hydrogen lines by varying @xmath79@xmath40(h@xmath22)/@xmath40(h@xmath22 ) in the range between 0 and 5% , and subtracting @xmath79@xmath40(h@xmath22 ) and @xmath79@xmath40(h@xmath35 ) respectively from the observed fluxes of h@xmath22 and h@xmath35 .",

    "for the set ew(@xmath323889 ) = 3.0  and ew(@xmath324471 ) = 0.4  we derive a primordial he mass fraction @xmath0 = 0.2421 @xmath8 0.0021 from the @xmath2  o / h linear regression and 0.2446 @xmath8 0.0016 from the @xmath2  n / h linear regression .",
    "for the set ew(@xmath323889 ) = 3.0  and ew(@xmath324471 ) = 0.5 , @xmath0 = 0.2444 @xmath8 0.0020 from the @xmath2  o / h linear regression and 0.2466 @xmath8 0.0016 from the @xmath2  n / h linear regression .",
    "the @xmath0s obtained from the @xmath2  o / h linear regressions considering known systematic effects are very similar to the value @xmath0 = 0.243 @xmath8 0.001 derived in  5 for the whole sample without correcting for the difference between @xmath6(he ii ) and @xmath6(o iii ) , the collisional excitation of hydrogen lines and the underlying stellar absorption in the he i lines .",
    "thus , the combined effect of the corrections for all known systematic effects turned out to be very small . in the more realistic case where gaseous continuum is taken into account ,",
    "the @xmath0s differ by only 0.4% . in the case where it is not taken into account ,",
    "they differ by 0.6% .",
    "this means that , even if all known systematic effects are taken into account in our previous work on the statistical derivation of @xmath0 by linear regressions ( itl94 , itl97 and it98 ) , the result will not be changed .",
    "while each individual systematic effect can change @xmath2 upward or downward by as much as 4% , they work in opposite sense and nearly cancel each other out . by nearly doubling our sample ( from 45 to 82 h ii regions ) and choosing the galaxies",
    "so that they span as large a metallicity range as possible , we have considerably reduced the uncertainties in the slopes @xmath9o = 4.3 @xmath8 0.7 and @xmath1 = 2.8 @xmath8 0.5 for the whole sample , as compared to @xmath9o = 5.7 @xmath8 1.8 and @xmath1 = 3.7 @xmath8 1.2 for the restricted sample with ew@xmath80(@xmath324471 ) = 0.4  and @xmath9o = 5.1 @xmath8 1.8 and @xmath1 = 3.4 @xmath8 1.2 with ew@xmath80(@xmath324471 ) = 0.5 .",
    "these values are consistent within the errors with our previous determinations . in a future paper",
    "we will apply the @xmath62 minimization technique to correct our whole sample of 82 h ii regions for known systematic effects and reduce further the uncertainties in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we will study in detail another possible additional systematic effect , that of the ionization structure of h ii regions , which we have not considered in this paper , simply setting the ionization correction factors of he i to 1 .",
    "with our value of @xmath0 = 0.2421@xmath80.0021 for ew@xmath80(@xmath324471 ) = 0.4and with an equivalent number of light neutrino species equal to 3 , the sbbn model gives @xmath82 = 10@xmath83@xmath20 = 3.4@xmath84 , where @xmath20 is the baryon - to - photon number ratio and the error bars denote 1@xmath15 errors .",
    "this corresponds to a baryonic mass fraction @xmath10@xmath11 = 0.012@xmath12 .",
    "the respective values of the cosmological parameters with @xmath0 = 0.2444@xmath80.0020 ( obtained for ew@xmath80(@xmath324471 ) = 0.5 ) are @xmath82 = 10@xmath83@xmath20 = 4.0@xmath85 and @xmath10@xmath11 = 0.015@xmath12 .",
    "these values are lower at the 2@xmath15 level than @xmath10@xmath11 = 0.021@xmath80.002 from recent measurements of the deuterium abundance in damped ly@xmath22 systems @xcite .",
    "the latter would correspond to @xmath0 = 0.2476@xmath86 .",
    "recent measurements of the fluctuations of the microwave background radiation by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) observations have improved considerably the precision of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the wmap data give @xmath10@xmath11 = 0.0224@xmath80.0009 , corresponding to @xmath0 = 0.2483@xmath80.0004 in the sbbn model , significantly higher than our values of @xmath0 , and inconsistent at the 95% c.l .",
    "if , with improved determinations , @xmath20 as obtained from the deuterium abundance and microwave background fluctuation measurements , remains systematically higher than its value obtained from the he abundance , then this may suggest deviations from sbbn theory .",
    "one possibiblity is that the equivalent number of the light neutrino species @xmath19 is less than 3 .",
    "combining @xmath10@xmath11 = 0.0224 @xmath8 0.0009 obtained by wmap @xcite with @xmath0 = 0.2421 @xmath8 0.0021 , we obtain @xmath19 = 2.48 with an upper limit @xmath19 @xmath76 2.83 at the 95% confidence level @xcite . with @xmath0",
    "= 0.2444 @xmath8 0.0020 , we obtain @xmath19 = 2.67 with an upper limit @xmath19 @xmath76 3.01 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "we present in this paper new high signal - to - noise spectrophotometric observations of 31 low - metallicity blue compact galaxies ( bcgs ) , containing 33 h ii regions and spanning a large range of heavy element mass fractions from @xmath23 @xmath3/30 to @xmath3/4 .",
    "we combine this new data with our previous data @xcite to construct a sample of 82 h ii regions and determine the primordial helium mass fraction @xmath0 by linear regressions to the sample .",
    "our sample constitutes one of the largest and most homogeneous ( obtained , reduced and analyzed in the same way ) data set now available for the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "we have considered known systematic effects on the he abundance determination . for the total sample of 82 h ii regions we have calculated @xmath33(he ii ) self - consistently and taken into account the effects of collisional and fluorescent enhancements . for a restricted sample of 6 h ii regions from our sample and an additional h ii region , ngc 346 in the small magellanic cloud ,",
    "we have examined , in addition to the collisional and fluorescent enhancements of he i emission lines , also the effects of collisional excitation of hydrogen emission lines , of underlying stellar he i absorption and of the difference between the temperature @xmath6(he ii ) in the he@xmath7 zone and the temperature @xmath6(o iii ) derived from the [ o iii]@xmath324363/(@xmath324959+@xmath325007 ) flux ratio .",
    "the restricted sample was chosen because the systematic effects on the @xmath0 determination of 5 of the galaxies in the sample have been discussed by @xcite , and we can compare our results to theirs .",
    "although each systematic effect may move the helium mass fraction @xmath2 up or down by as much as 4% , the combined result of the systematic effects on the restricted sample is relatively small ( @xmath870.6% ) , as they act in opposite sense and mostly cancel each other out .",
    "we derive for the restricted sample @xmath0 = 0.2421@xmath80.0021 adopting ew@xmath80(@xmath324471 ) = 0.4 .",
    "this corresponds to a baryonic mass fraction @xmath10@xmath11 = 0.012@xmath12 .",
    "if ew@xmath80(@xmath324471 ) = 0.5  is adopted then @xmath0 = 0.2444@xmath80.0020 corresponding to @xmath10@xmath11 = 0.015@xmath12 .",
    "these values of @xmath10@xmath11 are lower than the values derived from the deuterium abundance and microwave background radiation fluctuation measurements .",
    "this may indicate that the equivalent number of light neutrino species @xmath19 is less than 3 and hence that there are deviations from the standard big bang nucleosynthesis model .",
    "the slopes @xmath9o and @xmath1 derived from the @xmath2  o / h linear regressions for the restricted sample with two adopted values of ew@xmath80(@xmath324471 ) = 0.4  and 0.5  are respectively 5.7 @xmath8 1.8 , 3.7 @xmath8 1.2 , and 5.1 @xmath8 1.8 , 3.4 @xmath8 1.2 .",
    "they are consistent with previous determinations by @xcite and @xcite using bcgs , and by @xcite from nearby k dwarf stars .",
    "we have considerably reduced the errors in the @xmath9o and @xmath1 slopes derived for the whole sample as it contains galaxies spanning a wide range of metallicities , which was not the case in our previous work . from the @xmath2  o / h linear regression of the whole sample , with only collisional and fluorescent enhancements taken into account , we derive slopes @xmath9o = 4.3 @xmath8 0.7 and @xmath1 = 2.8 @xmath8 0.5 , in good agreement with the slopes derived from the subsample of 7 h ii regions where all known systematic effects , with the exception of ionization correction effects , are taken into account .",
