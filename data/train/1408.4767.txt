    "recently , a class of two - dimensional integrate and fire type models have been developed which can be fit to properties of real neurons .",
    "this class of models includes the adapting , leaky integrate and fire neuron ( lif ) @xcite , the izhikevich model @xcite , the quartic integrate and fire model @xcite , and the adaptive exponential integrate and fire model ( adex ) @xcite .",
    "the models in this class are far simpler to fit and simulate than traditional conductance based models .",
    "nevertheless , these models still replicate the more complex behaviors of real neurons @xcite .",
    "these models have been fit to several different neuron types so that the behavior of large networks of these neuron models may be studied through numerical exploration of the parameter space .",
    "for example , this approach has been used to determine the role of various parameters in the generation of adaptation induced bursting in networks of ca3 pyramidal neurons @xcite while the numerical simulation of integrate and fire networks is far simpler and faster than that of conductance based models , numerical exploration of the parameter space is still a time - consuming process .",
    "furthermore , one can not easily perform direct bifurcation analysis on large networks .",
    "fortunately , a system of mean field equations has been derived for these large networks of two - dimensional integrate and fire neurons @xcite .",
    "this derivation assumes that the networks are all - to - all coupled and the neuronal parameters are homogeneous within the network .",
    "the resulting mean field system is a set of non - smooth differential equations governing the first moments of the adaptation variable and the synaptic coupling variable .",
    "the mean field system of equations is analytically derived from the original network , without any further fitting .",
    "thus , one can conduct bifurcation analysis ( either analytically or numerically ) on the mean field system with confidence that the results are representative of the behavior of the original network of model neurons , and possibly the original network of actual neurons .",
    "such a level of correspondence between the parameters for the individual neurons , and the resulting behavior of the full network is currently not possible with more sophisticated types of neuron models .",
    "however , analysis of the derived mean field system has an added level of difficulty as the system of equations is non - smooth . both classical bifurcation theory and the newer field of non - smooth bifurcation theory must be used to adequately understand the behavior of the mean field system , and thus the full network .",
    "here we explore , both analytically and numerically , many of the non - smooth bifurcations and phenomena that occur in the mean field system of equations from @xcite .",
    "the primary mean field system we use is that of the izhikevich model , with the neuronal models fit to hippocampal area ca3 pyramidal neuron data @xcite .",
    "we modify the parameters slightly as the neuronal model used in @xcite was an alteration of the default izhikevich model to better fit the action potential half - width observed in the data .",
    "we use this model primarily for two reasons : it is the most analytically tractable and the parameters have been fit to neuronal data .",
    "however , as we will see , many of the non - smooth bifurcations are present in the other models in the general class of two - dimensional adapting integrate and fire neurons .",
    "whenever possible we present our results in terms of this general class .",
    "we consider two - dimensional integrate and fire models of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 represents the nondimensionalized membrane potential , and @xmath2 serves as an adaptation variable .",
    "time has also been non - dimensionalized .",
    "the dynamical equations ( [ de1])-([de2 ] ) are supplemented by the following discontinuities @xmath3 this particular notation was formally introduced in @xcite , along with a full bifurcation analysis of this general family of adapting integrate and fire neurons .",
    "members of this family include the izhikevich model , the adaptive exponential ( adex ) integrate and fire model , and the quartic integrate and fire model @xcite .",
    "these neurons can be coupled together via a synaptic gating variable , @xmath4 .",
    "the gating variable typically takes the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the time that the @xmath7th neuron fires its @xmath8th spike , @xmath7 is the index of the presynaptic neuron , and @xmath9 is the index of the postsynaptic neuron .",
    "the function @xmath10 varies depending on which synaptic pulse function is used .",
    "examples include the exponential synapse , the double exponential synapse , and the alpha synapse @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we restrict our attention to the exponential synapse , however the analysis can be extended to the other synaptic types without much difficulty . for the exponential synapse ,",
    "@xmath10 is given by : @xmath11    given the form for @xmath10 , one can derive a differential equation for @xmath12 , the total synaptic input to the @xmath13 neuron @xcite .",
    "for example , for the exponential synapse the differential equation for @xmath14 is @xmath15 for all - to - all coupling , the function @xmath14 becomes identical for all the neurons , and can be replaced by a single variable @xmath4 , the global synaptic coupling function . in this case , the equations for the entire network are : @xmath16 the specific forms of @xmath17 we consider are : @xmath18 these forms can be arrived at through a suitable non - dimensionalization of the original equations for these models @xcite .",
    "note that the non - dimensionalization for the izhikevich model differs from the one used by @xcite and is from @xcite .",
    "these networks often display bursting , a oscillatory behaviour where the individual neurons alternate between firing and quiescence @xcite .",
    "the other common behaviour is tonic firing , where the neurons all fire at a constant rate .",
    "the transition between these two behaviours is a bifurcation of the full network .",
    "an example of this transition for a network of 1000 izhikevich neurons with all - to - all coupling is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the parameters for this network can be found in table 1 . in figure",
    "[ fig1a ] , the neurons in the network fire spikes , and the mean - adaptation variable , @xmath19 , and the synaptic coupling variable , @xmath20 both converge to a stable steady state . in figure",
    "[ fig1b ] , the neurons fire synchronized bursts , and the pair of variables @xmath21 converge to a steady state limit cycle , representing the oscillation between firing and quiescence that the individual neurons undergo .",
    "this occurs as the current @xmath22 is decreased from @xmath23 in figure [ fig1a ] to @xmath24 in figure [ fig1b ] .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig1 ] , the network variables @xmath20 and @xmath19 can capture a great deal of information about the behavior of the entire network .",
    "further , their steady state behaviour undergoes a qualitative change as the parameter @xmath22 is decreased .",
    "thus , it would be advantageous to have a closed set of differential equations for these variables , as any qualitative change in the behavior of the full network should manifest itself as a bifurcation of the dynamical system for @xmath25 . in the following subsection",
    ", we derive such a system for these network variables .      to derive the mean field system one begins by defining the population density function , @xmath26 , which is a probability density function for the location of of the variables @xmath27 in the phase space .",
    "that is , the probability of finding a neuron in the region @xmath28 of phase space is given by integrating @xmath29 over @xmath28 .",
    "starting from the full network model , one can derive ( in the limit that @xmath30 ) a partial differential equation that governs the evolution of the probability density function @xmath26 and predicts the large network dynamics of the original model @xcite .",
    "this partial differential equation , called the population density equation , takes the form @xmath31 where the term @xmath32 is referred to as the flux .",
    "the discontinuities and discrete jumps in the model neurons impose a boundary condition on the flux : @xmath33 this pde is coupled to an ode for @xmath20 , given by @xmath34    in order to reduce this system to a small , closed set of ordinary differential equations , one has to apply a series of approximations .",
    "the derivation is somewhat lengthy thus we refer the reader to @xcite for the exact details . after the approximations are made , the resulting mean field system is given by :    @xmath35^{-1 } & \\quad \\text{if}\\quad   h(w   , s)>0\\\\ 0 & \\quad \\text{if } \\quad h(w , s)\\leq 0   \\end{cases } \\label{mfc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath20 and @xmath19 correspond to the mean network adaptation and global synaptic coupling variable .",
    "note that we have omitted the @xmath36 brackets denoting the average value of @xmath2 present in @xcite for simplicity and clarity .",
    "the function @xmath37 is the instantaneous network averaged firing rate , as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "the function @xmath38 defines when the integral in makes sense .",
    "it defines _ switching manifold _ of the nonsmooth system .    one can derive an expression for the switching manifold equation by determining when the denominator in @xmath39 first becomes zero somewhere in the @xmath40 phase space . to do this we find the minimum of @xmath41 , for @xmath42 $ ] , regarding @xmath20 and @xmath19 as fixed parameters . for the general class of models studied in @xcite ,",
    "the function @xmath17 is assumed to be strictly convex , that is @xmath43 , and at least three times continuously differentiable .",
    "it follows that @xmath41 is also strictly convex as a function of @xmath1 , and hence its minimum on @xmath44 $ ] occurs at a critical point .",
    "the critical points ( as a function of @xmath1 ) are given by solving @xmath45 thus @xmath46 is the value of @xmath1 at which @xmath47 has a minimum .",
    "the leaky integrate - and - fire neuron is not strictly convex .",
    "in fact @xmath48 for this model , thus the minimum of @xmath47 occurs at the right endpoint of the interval .    in either case",
    ", the minimum value defines the function @xmath38 @xmath49 and the switching manifold equation @xmath50 this latter expression is useful as we can think of @xmath51 as an @xmath52 and @xmath53 dependent rheobase current .",
    "anywhere in the phase space where @xmath54 the network is firing with mean firing rate given by @xmath55^{-1}.   \\label{fr}\\ ] ] anywhere that @xmath56 the network is quiescent and the mean firing rate is 0 .",
    "there are a couple of important facts to note before we proceed further .",
    "first of all , @xmath57 , the rheobase current for the uncoupled , nonadapting neuron , which is governed by the equation @xmath58 based on the assumptions made on @xmath17 in @xcite , then this model neuron has a type - i firing profile .",
    "additionally , given that @xmath59 , we also have the following equation @xmath60 these two facts will prove important for our later analysis .    to conclude we display some expressions for specific models .",
    "the rheobase currents are given by @xmath61 with corresponding minimum values of @xmath47 : @xmath62    for both the lif model and izhikevich model , the mean firing rate can be evaluated analytically : @xmath63 for the other models , the firing rate must be evaluated numerically .",
    "this can be done by integrating equation over @xmath44 $ ] treating @xmath64 , and @xmath20 as fixed parameters at each time step .",
    "this approach can be used to numerically analyze the bifurcation types of these equations using numerical bifurcation software , such as matcont , among others @xcite .",
    "however , the numerical integration method should be of high enough order accuracy for the numerical continuation results to be trusted .    given the mean field system described above , one should consider whether numerical bifurcation results or analytical approaches should be taken .",
    "numerical bifurcation analysis can yield results which are accurate throughout the phase space , but require choosing a particular model and determining which parameters to fix and which to vary .",
    "analytical methods can yield model independent results and give insight into the role of various parameters in system behaviour , however , they are often restricted to particular regions of the parameter space and/or phase space , as we shall see .",
    "in order to proceed analytically , we need to sacrifice some of the complexity of the original mean field system .",
    "in particular , as the usual formulas of @xmath37 are difficult to deal with analytically , we approximate the firing rate for all the two dimensional integrate and fire models as follows : @xmath65 where the form of @xmath66 varies from model to model .",
    "there are two approaches to justify this particular approximation , one local and one global .",
    "the local method relies on the fact that all the neuron models fire with a type i profile , and as such , they have a characteristic firing rate near the switching manifold that is proportional to @xmath67 this basic result follows from the normal form for a saddle node bifurcation .",
    "this reduction is valid when @xmath68 is small .",
    "this occurs when @xmath69 and @xmath70 are small and @xmath22 is close to @xmath71 .",
    "we note that this approximation and very similar differential equations appear in @xcite .",
    "for example , equations ( 3.6)-(3.7 ) in @xcite are similar to ours however the interpretation for those particular equations was for the firing rate of an e / i coupled pair of neurons .",
    "additionally , the non - smooth nature of those equations is not explored to the best our knowledge in any source .    for a more global approximation",
    ", one can fit a function @xmath72 to @xmath37 .",
    "for example , we have found that for the izhikevich network , the approximation @xmath73^{-1 } \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{i - i^*(s , w ) } \\label{mfs}\\ ] ] is much better globally than the local approximation for type i firing neurons , which is given by : @xmath74 as shown in figure [ fig2 ] . as equations and",
    "only differ by a multiplicative constant , we take the firing rate to be in the form @xmath75 , which is valid for the izhikevich network globally , and for the other networks locally in the phase and parameter space . note that whichever constant is used , it can be merely absorbed into the @xmath76 and @xmath77 terms in the mean field dynamical equations .",
    "this particular approximation turns out to yield a system that is tractable to analysis of both the smooth and non - smooth bifurcations displayed by this system , and shows a considerable degree of accuracy with both the actual network , and the original mean - field system , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we reiterate that the non - smooth nature of these equations is often not considered .",
    "however , we will show that recent developments in non - smooth bifurcation theory allow us to analyze these equations more fully .    with the above simplification , the approximate mean field system that we analyze is given by @xmath78 where the switching manifold varies depending on which neuron model",
    "the terms @xmath76 and @xmath77 are rescaled to absorb any constant term in ( [ fr1 ] ) or ( [ mfs ] ) .",
    "we will refer to equations ( [ s1])-([r1 ] ) from here on as the reduced mean - field system .",
    "we first classify the type of non - smoothness that this system exhibits .",
    "the system is smooth and has derivatives of all orders everywhere except on the switching manifold , i.e. , when @xmath79 . on the switching manifold ,",
    "the system is continuous but not differentiable .",
    "thus , this is a piecewise - smooth continuous ( pwsc ) system .",
    "equivalently , it has a uniform order of discontinuity of 1 @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the order of discontinuity for the full ( non - simplified ) izhikevich mean field system is non - uniform . to see this , rewrite @xmath80 and consider the limit",
    "@xmath81 straightforward calculations show that this limit is @xmath82 , and hence the order of discontinuity of the model is @xmath83 , only if @xmath84 outside of this region the order of discontinuity is not @xmath83 . in general @xmath85 for physical reasons , so the order of discontinuity of the full izhikevich model is @xmath83 if @xmath70 is sufficiently small .",
    "thus the approximation simplifies the analysis as it has a uniform order of discontinuity , however , it will likely be a reasonable approximation of the izhikevich model only when this latter model has order of discontinuity @xmath83 , i.e. , if @xmath70 is sufficiently small .    to summarize , for all the neuron models we consider the firing rate to be approximated by @xmath86 based on the type i profile for all the models , where @xmath87 varies depending on which model is used .",
    "these approximations are only local in nature , being valid only when @xmath88 , aside from the izhikevich model , as one can fit a more global approximation to the network averaged firing rate , as stated earlier .",
    "the equilibria of the mean field equations - depend on the sign of @xmath89 .    if @xmath56 then the only equilibrium point is the trivial solution , @xmath90 , which is a stable node .",
    "this equilibrium corresponds to all the neurons being quiescent , @xmath91 , thus we will refer to it as the non - firing solution .",
    "it will only exist when the origin of the phase space lies in the region where @xmath92 , which corresponds to @xmath93 .",
    "alternatively , in the language of non - smooth dynamical systems theory , @xmath94 is virtual if @xmath95 and real if @xmath96 @xcite .    if @xmath97 , nontrivial equilibria @xmath98 may exist .",
    "if they do then @xmath40 must satisfy @xmath99 where @xmath100 , and a similar equation holds for @xmath101 . equations ( [ work1 ] ) and ( [ work2 ] ) yield the following relationship @xmath102 thus the equilibria are given by @xmath103 where @xmath20 satisfies the nonlinear equation @xmath104 note that equation implies that @xmath105 .",
    "thus for an equilibrium to be a valid , it must satisfy @xmath106 ( which implies @xmath107 ) .",
    "the equilibrium condition for the quartic and adex models yield nonlinear equations without analytic closed form solutions .",
    "however , one can apply a power series ( assuming that @xmath70 is small ) to come up with an approximation to the steady solutions .",
    "note that @xmath108 is actually always a function of @xmath70 , as opposed to just @xmath20 , as it is given by solving the algebraic equation .",
    "thus , we can write down the following expansions for @xmath46 and @xmath109 @xmath110 where ( [ exp2 ] ) can be derived from using the relationship ( [ exp0 ] ) . since these expansions are valid if @xmath70 is sufficiently small , we will refer to them as the weak coupling expansions .",
    "if we use only the initial terms shown in equations ( [ exp1])-([exp2 ] ) , then the approximate solution obtained is exact in the case of the izhikevich model as all higher order terms vanish , and is the simplest analytical approximation to the other models . using these terms , we arrive at the following equation for the weak - coupling expansion to the equilibrium points : @xmath111 this equation",
    "can be solved , yielding two solution branches : @xmath112 we will denote the corresponding equilibria as @xmath113 . defining the new parameters @xmath114 the @xmath20 variable of the solution branches may be written @xmath115 note that @xmath116 .",
    "further , since @xmath117 is the minimum of @xmath17 and the reversal potential for an excitatory synapse is above the resting membrane potential , @xmath118 , we have @xmath119 .",
    "it follows that @xmath120 is a strictly positive function .    in a similar way",
    ", one can solve for the equilibrium values of the full izhikevich model analytically .",
    "two equilibria @xmath121 of the same form are obtained with @xmath122 given by : @xmath123 introducing the parameters @xmath124 the steady states can again be written in the form .",
    "note , as a check of consistency , that @xmath125 , and @xmath126 for the izhikevich model .",
    "based on the form and the fact that @xmath116 , it is straightforward to show the signs of @xmath127 are as shown in figure [ fig3](a ) . since we require the equilibrium solutions to be positive , @xmath121 will have different regions of existence depending on the values of @xmath128 and @xmath129 . in particular , both equilibrium points exist when @xmath130 and @xmath131 in a wedge shaped region given by @xmath132 . only @xmath133 exists",
    "when @xmath134 .",
    "neither solution exists in other parts of the parameter space .",
    "the regions of existence of @xmath135 and the non - firing solution are show for the izhikevich model in figure [ fig3](b ) .",
    "away from the switching manifold , we can analyze the smooth bifurcations of the equilibria via linearization .",
    "the non - firing solution does not undergo any smooth bifurcations , as it lies in the region of phase space governed by the equations @xmath136 thus the non - firing solution is asymptotically stable when it exists and does not lie on the switching manifold , i.e. , for @xmath130 . to analyze the nontrivial equilibrium points , consider the jacobian of the mean field system in the region of phase space where @xmath54 @xmath137 we can simplify the jacobian by imposing the steady state condition @xmath138 .",
    "additionally , one can note that : @xmath139 applying these formulas yields the following simplified jacobian @xmath140 which has trace and determinant given by @xmath141 we can now discuss the stability of each equilibrium in its region of existence .",
    "first we apply the weak coupling expansion to the determinant : @xmath142 upon substitution of the equilibrium values of @xmath20 and using the definition of @xmath128 , we obtain @xmath143 since the sign of @xmath144 is strictly positive , and the equilibria are only defined when @xmath145 , we can immediately conclude that @xmath146 now , this implies that the equilibrium @xmath147 is always an unstable saddle .",
    "the equilibrium @xmath133 , however , can be a node or a focus and its stability is determined by the trace .",
    "we will discuss this further in section [ hopfsec ] .",
    "note that these results are only valid when @xmath148 is small for the qif and adex models , but are globally valid for the izhikevich model .",
    "we can use the equations for the trace and determinant to formulate necessary conditions for the equilibria to display certain smooth bifurcations .",
    "in particular , @xmath149 and @xmath150 are necessary conditions for an equilibrium to undergo a saddle - node bifurcation , while @xmath151 and @xmath152 are necessary conditions for a hopf bifurcation .",
    "having both @xmath149 and @xmath153 , is a necessary condition for a bogdanov - takens bifurcation . of course , to determine if these bifurcations actually occur requires checking additional genericity conditions . in the following section",
    ", we check these conditions where possible .",
    "as described above , necessary conditions for a saddle - node bifurcation are @xmath154 and @xmath150 .",
    "it is easy to see from that the first condition is satisfied for both @xmath135 when @xmath155 .",
    "it can be shown that the second condition is satisfied except at isolated points in the @xmath156 parameter space as determined in section  [ hopfsec ] . in the following",
    "we will assume that we exclude these points .    to pursue this further",
    ", we study the existence of the equilibria . from the previous subsection , we know that @xmath135 both exist if @xmath132 and neither exists if @xmath157 . when @xmath158 , the two equilibria collapse into a single equilibrium , with @xmath159 .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath160 corresponds to a two - parameter curve of saddle - node bifurcation .",
    "rewriting this in terms of the original parameters yields the two - parameter bifurcation curve in terms of @xmath156 : @xmath161 thus , for fixed @xmath162 , @xmath163 is the value of the current that corresponds to a saddle - node bifurcation point .",
    "there are two things to note about @xmath164 . first , since @xmath165 is a strictly positive function , then @xmath166 with @xmath167 only if @xmath168 .",
    "also , this curve is only defined for @xmath169 . to see this , note that the saddle - node equilibrium , given by @xmath170 only exists if @xmath171 .",
    "since @xmath172 , @xmath173 only exists if @xmath169 .",
    "we shall see later that @xmath168 actually corresponds to a non - smooth co - dimension two bifurcation point .      from the analysis of subsection  [ stabsec ] , we know that only @xmath133 may undergo a hopf bifurcation and that det@xmath174 if @xmath175 .",
    "we thus conclude that the determinant condition for the hopf bifurcation is given by @xmath176 . to determine a necessary condition for the hopf bifurcation , we begin by applying the weak coupling expansion to the trace associated with @xmath177 : @xmath178 note that the first term is strictly negative and @xmath179 is a strictly positive function .    setting the trace to zero and",
    "using equations - which define @xmath180 and @xmath177 yields @xmath181 solving for @xmath22 gives @xmath182 \\stackrel{def}{= } i_{ah}(g ) \\label{iahdef}\\ ] ] we thus conclude that if @xmath183 and @xmath176 then the equilibrium @xmath177 has a pair of pure imaginary eigenvalues .",
    "recall that @xmath179 , @xmath120 , and @xmath165 , are positive functions .",
    "further , it is easy to check that @xmath184 .",
    "this leads to several observations .",
    "first , since the third equation in the sequence above can only be satisfied if @xmath185 , it follows that if @xmath186 then no hopf bifurcation occurs .",
    "second , from the first equation in the sequence above we must have @xmath187 in order for the equilibrium @xmath177 to exist at the hopf bifurcation .",
    "when @xmath188 @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "we shall see later that the point @xmath191 , @xmath188 is a codimension-2 non - smooth bifurcation point . finally , if @xmath192 , then @xmath193 with @xmath194 only if @xmath195 . if @xmath196 , then it is possible for @xmath183 to intersect @xmath191 .",
    "we denote by @xmath197 the value of @xmath162 at the intersection point , if it exists",
    ".    we can now determine the stability of the equilibrium @xmath133 by studying the trace equation .",
    "since the first term in this equation is strictly negative wherever it is defined ( when @xmath133 exists ) , the sign of the trace is determined by @xmath198 .",
    "since @xmath177 and @xmath179 are positive , it follows from the discussion above that in the case @xmath199 the trace negative , and hence @xmath200 is asymptotically stable , wherever @xmath133 exists .",
    "if @xmath201 then that the trace is negative ( and @xmath133 is asymptotically stable ) if @xmath202 or @xmath203 and @xmath204 .",
    "the trace is positive ( and @xmath133 is unstable ) if @xmath203 and @xmath205 .",
    "note that if @xmath22 is sufficiently close to @xmath206 then @xmath133 will have a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues . in summary , for fixed @xmath162 with @xmath207 and @xmath208 , the equilibrium @xmath133 undergoes a hopf bifurcation at @xmath183 if @xmath176 . we do not attempt to determine the criticality of this bifurcation analytically , but",
    "will study it numerically in a later section .",
    "further , we can now state completely the conditions for the saddle - node bifurcation : for fixed @xmath162 with @xmath196 , the equilibria @xmath133 and @xmath147 undergo a saddle - node bifurcation when @xmath209 if @xmath210 .",
    "recall that necessary conditions for a bogdanov - takens bifurcation are @xmath211 and @xmath153 .",
    "thus , from the analysis of the last two subsections , bogdanov - takens bifurcations ( if they exist ) will occur at intersection point of the curves of saddle node and hopf bifurcations in the @xmath212 parameter space , i.e. , at values of @xmath162 such that @xmath213 , with @xmath214 . using the expressions for these curves",

    "if @xmath220 and @xmath221 is not too large then there can be up to two roots . thus there may be up to two bogdanov - takens points .",
    "the case @xmath222 is degenerate .",
    "there is a single root which is given by @xmath223 .",
    "this is not a standard / smooth bogdanov - takens point as the points @xmath224 and @xmath225 are not standard saddle - node and hopf points .",

    "figure  [ bebc ] shows the bifurcation for the same system with @xmath249 . in this case",
    "there is a non - smooth limit cycle for @xmath134 that appears to be destroyed when @xmath191 .",

    "based on our numerical results we hypothesize that a non - smooth limit cycle may be destroyed in a homoclinic - like bifurcation as @xmath22 decreases through @xmath71 .",
    "we support this hypothesis in two ways .",
    "first , consider the vector field in the neighbourhood of the origin . recall that the origin is always an attractor when it lies in the region where @xmath250 . in the region where @xmath251 , setting @xmath191 and retaining only the highest order terms in @xmath20 and @xmath2 gives",
    ": @xmath252 thus , for @xmath253 , and @xmath254 the vector field point away from the origin and the boundary equilibrium @xmath255 is a repeller in this region . since the boundary equilibrium point is as a repeller on one side of the switching manifold and and an attractor on the other , it is possible for a non - smooth homoclinic orbit to this equilibrium point to exist when @xmath191 .",
    "second , we show that under certain parameter conditions , if a non - smooth limit cycle surrounds the equilibrium @xmath200 , it must be destroyed when @xmath191 . to do this",
    "we show that trajectories that cross the switching manifold when @xmath71 lie within the basin of attraction of the origin .",
    "thus any non - smooth limit cycle must become homoclinic to the origin at @xmath191 .",
    "note that if @xmath256 , then @xmath257 and thus @xmath258 for some constant @xmath259 .",
    "assuming that the trajectory starts with @xmath260 on the switching manifold then @xmath261 where @xmath262 .",
    "now suppose this trajectory crosses the switching manifold again at @xmath98",
    ". then @xmath263 clearly two solutions of this equation are @xmath260 and @xmath255 . dividing through by @xmath20 and simplifying one obtains @xmath264 where @xmath265 .    if @xmath266 the left hand side of is monotonically increasing while the right hand side is a line with negative slope .",
    "hence @xmath260 is the unique intersection point .",
    "this means every trajectory that enters the region @xmath256 when @xmath191 is attracted to the origin . if @xmath267 , the left side of is now monotonically decreasing . unless the line is tangent the curve at @xmath268 there will always be another intersection point . rearranging",
    "the equation shows that this intersection point will occur for @xmath269 if @xmath270 is sufficiently small . for fixed @xmath162 ,",
    "this means that any trajectory that starts on the switching manifold at @xmath271 with @xmath272 sufficiently small will be attracted to the origin .",
    "thus all non - smooth limit cycles that are close enough to the origin for @xmath134 will become homoclinic to the origin when @xmath191 .    given how @xmath188 , and @xmath168 delimit the different types of beb bifurcations",
    ", it should be clear that these special points represent higher codimension bifurcations along the @xmath191 line .",
    "we shall explore these bifurcations further below , in addition to determining the geometrical meaning of these points .      from the previous section , we concluded that the point @xmath274 is a special codimension - two bifurcation point where the boundary equilibrium bifurcation ( beb ) changes from a persistence beb to a non - smooth saddle - node .",
    "note that the smooth branch of saddle - node bifurcations found earlier actually emanates out from the codimension-2 point @xmath275 .",
    "we will show here that it does so in a highly non - generic way as the saddle - node equilibrium hits switching manifold tangentially at the beb , and is the only equilibrium point that interacts with the switching manifold in this way .",
    "we have seen that regardless of the parameter values , all the nontrivial equilibria lie on the curve @xmath276 .",
    "thus as any parameter is varied the nontrivial equilibrium will follow this curve , which has slope @xmath277 further , the only equilibrium that can be boundary equilibrium point is @xmath278 , the non - firing solution . now",
    "the switching manifold can be written as @xmath279 thus , at the slope of the switching manifold at the beb is @xmath280 equating and shows that the nontrivial equilibrium undergoing the beb will hit the switching manifold tangentially only if @xmath281 . from this it is straightforward to show that with @xmath168 fixed , the nontrivial equilibrium @xmath133 hits the switching manifold tangentially as @xmath282 @xmath283 .",
    "more interesting is to consider what happens when @xmath162 is varied . from our previous analysis we know that at the saddle - node bifurcation point , the saddle - node equilibrium , @xmath284 is defined by @xmath285 thus , as @xmath286 , @xmath287 .",
    "this implies that the saddle - node equilibrium hits the switching manifold tangentially at @xmath168 , @xmath191 . in summary",
    "the point @xmath288 is the collision between three branches of codimension-1 bifurcations : a pair of non - smooth boundary equilibrium bifurcations and a smooth branch of saddle - node bifurcations .",
    "the details of the beb involve depend on the relationship between @xmath236 and @xmath237 .",
    "if @xmath289 , bebs are simple : a simple node / focus or focus / focus persistence beb occurs for @xmath241 and a non - smooth saddle - node beb occurs for @xmath241 .",
    "the case @xmath208 is more complex due to the possible presence of limit cycles associated with the hopf bifurcation . in the case",
    "we studied numerically and described in section  [ bebsec ] , for @xmath241 we observe a homoclinic persistence beb and for @xmath196 we observe a snic beb .",
    "while this bifurcation may be complicated , the bifurcation point can be determined analytically for all the models . of particular interest",
    "is the underlying physical interpretation . associated with this point",
    "is a region in the @xmath196 , @xmath130 quadrant of the parameter space with both stable firing and non - firing solutions , and hence bistability .",
    "this bifurcation point is shown in detail in figure [ fig10b ] .",
    "the andronov - hopf bifurcation described in section  [ hopfsec ] leads to the creation of a limit cycle . as @xmath22 moves away from the bifurcation point ,",
    "the amplitude of the limit cycle may increase enough that it hits the switching manifold tangentially , resulting in a grazing bifurcation .",
    "it is difficult to say much in general about the nature of this bifurcation , however , analysis similar to that in the last section shows that if @xmath130 then once a trajectory enters the region @xmath256 , it can not leave , but will be attracted to the origin .",
    "thus we expect that if a grazing bifurcation occurs for @xmath130 it will lead to the destruction of the limit cycle .    to gain more insight , we performed a numerical study of the mean field system corresponding to the izhikevich network with parameter values as in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we first confirmed that the hopf bifurcation is subcritical , using matcont and by numerically simulating the time reversed system .",
    "we then showed that the unstable limit cycle generated by the hopf can undergo two different types of grazing bifurcations , depending on the value @xmath22 . for @xmath134 ,",
    "the grazing bifurcation that occurs is a persistence type grazing , i.e. , the unstable limit cycle generated via the subcritical hopf bifurcation just becomes non - smooth after the grazing bifurcation .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig7a ] . here , the limit cycle undergoes a grazing bifurcation at @xmath290 , and it persists past it .",
    "its amplitude rapidly increases past the grazing bifurcation , and it almost immediately undergoes a non - smooth saddle - node of limit cycles with a stable non - smooth limit cycle . for @xmath130 ,",
    "the grazing bifurcation is a destruction type grazing as the limit cycle ceases to exist after the grazing for the reason discussed above .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig7b ] .",
    "if the hopf were supercritical we would expect to see the same two types of grazing bifurcations .",
    "the only difference would be that the grazing bifurcation would occur for @xmath205 and we would not expect the saddle - node of limit cycles bifurcation to occur .",
    "the analysis of section  [ bebsec ] showed that when @xmath208 the point @xmath291 is a codimension - two bifurcation point where the boundary equilibrium changes from a simple focus / node persistence beb to a homoclinic persistence beb . recall that the two parameter hopf bifurcation curve is given by @xmath183 as defined in section  [ hopfsec ] . from the analysis in that section ,",
    "the equilibrium point on the hopf curve is @xmath292 where @xmath293 . setting @xmath183",
    "we see that as @xmath294 , @xmath295 and @xmath296 , that is the hopf equilibrium point undergoes a beb at @xmath291 .",
    "we thus refer to this point as a hopf boundary equilibrium bifurcation ( hopf beb ) .",
    "an alternative way to characterize the hopf beb is to fix @xmath191 and let @xmath297 .",
    "on @xmath191 , the mean field system for the izhikevich network may be approximated as follows : @xmath298 for @xmath98 in the vicinity of the origin .",
    "thus , we have @xmath299 for the trajectory of the homoclinic limit cycle . additionally , linearizing the switching manifold about the origin yields",
    "; @xmath300 now , using these two equations we can solve for grazing bifurcations of the homoclinic limit cycle with the switching manifold at the origin . solving the grazing condition @xmath301 yields @xmath302",
    "thus , the hopf beb bifurcation can be seen as a grazing bifurcation which destroys the non - smooth homoclinic limit cycle to the origin .",
    "our analysis so far shows three branches of bifurcation emanating from this codimension - two point : two non - smooth beb branches and a branch of hopf bifurcation .",
    "as shown in figure  [ bebfig ] , for @xmath245 there is a simple persistence beb , while for @xmath303 there is a homoclinic persistence beb .",
    "we have numerically studied the bifurcations that occur in a neighbourhood of this point for the izhikevich model and find that that two more branches of bifurcation appear to emanate from this point we describe below .",
    "let @xmath162 be fixed with @xmath207 and consider the sequence of bifurcations involving limit cycles . at @xmath191 a stable non - smooth limit cycle",
    "is created in a homoclinic persistence beb , at @xmath304 an unstable smooth limit cycle is created in a subcritical hopf bifurcation . as @xmath22 increases the smooth limit cycle becomes non - smooth in a grazing bifurcation and then is destroyed along with the stable non - smooth limit cycle in a saddle - node of limit cycles .",
    "we wish to determine how the grazing and saddle - node of limit cycles bifurcations behave near @xmath188 .    to do this we followed the stable non - smooth limit cycle along the hopf bifurcation curve . specifically , we numerically computed the amplitude and period of the limit cycle along the curve @xmath305 in the @xmath156 parameter space with @xmath306 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig9 ] , specifically figure [ fig9a ] .",
    "the stable non - smooth limit cycle is computed using direct simulations of the ode system , where the system is initialized exterior to the limit cycle in the phase plane which ensures convergence . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the amplitude of the stable non - smooth limit cycles goes to 0 as @xmath306 .",
    "this implies that this limit cycle collapses to the origin @xmath255 .",
    "but as this bursting limit cycle is one part of the saddle - node of limit cycles bifurcation , then this bifurcation must also emerge from hopf beb .",
    "since the grazing bifurcation lies between the saddle - node of limit cycles and the hopf bifurcation , the persistence grazing bifurcation must also emerge from the point @xmath307 .",
    "the entire sequence of bifurcations near the hopf beb is shown in figures [ fig10a ] and [ fig10d ] .",
    "we briefly note that if @xmath308 , then we have @xmath309 which means that the hopf and saddle - node beb points coincide in a non - smooth codimension-3 bifurcation point .",
    "this bifurcation point may be thought of as a bogdanov - takens equilibrium point lying on a switching manifold .",
    "however , we note that there is no bogdanov - takens bifurcation ( or for that matter saddle - node or hopf bifurcations ) at this point in the classical sense , as the jacobian of the system diverges , and hence the conditions associated with these different smooth bifurcations can not be satisfied .",
    "this point appears to act as an organizing center for the bifurcation diagram , with all the non - smooth bifurcations emanating from it .",
    "due to the complexity of this point , we will leave its analysis for future work .",
    "however , it does illustrate how rich the non - smooth bifurcation sequence of this relatively simple pwsc system is .",
    "in addition to the two local non - smooth bifurcations that occur at @xmath188 , and @xmath168 , there appears to be a global codimension-2 bifurcation that occurs for these mean field systems .",
    "recall that there are two different types of grazing bifurcations , a destruction type ( which occurs for @xmath130 ) and a persistence type ( which occurs for @xmath134 .",
    "these are shown in figure [ fig7 ] .",
    "thus there is a co - dimension two point when the grazing bifurcation crosses @xmath191 . as for the other co - dimension",
    "two points , one may expect that would be a change in the beb bifurcations at this point . in the case we have studied numerically it appears that the beb changes from snic type before this transition to a regular non - smooth fold after .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig10c ] and figure [ fig10d ] .",
    "note that this transition occurs for @xmath310 , i.e. , after the second intersection of the hopf curve with @xmath191 .",
    "it also appears that the saddle - node of non - smooth limit cycles bifurcation emanates from this point . note that this does not imply that there is a second impact with the hopf equilibrium and the switching manifold , as @xmath311 .",
    "this bifurcation results in the destruction of the homoclinic limit cycle that exists on @xmath191 , and it is very difficult to analyze , as it is a non - local co - dimension 2 non - smooth bifurcation .",
    "geometrically , however it occurs when the unstable smooth limit cycle ( generated via the hopf bifurcation ) grazes the switching manifold at @xmath191 .",
    "if the hopf bifurcation were supercritical instead of subcritical we would expect a similar codimension two point to occur ( if a grazing bifurcation occurred ) .",
    "however , it would occur for @xmath312 .",
    "again , due to the complexity of this particular bifurcation , further analysis is beyond the scope of this paper , and we leave it for future work .",
    "while the preceding analysis revealed a great deal of novelty and non - smooth bifurcations for the reduced mean - field system , in order for the non - smooth analysis to be useful , it has to be reflective of the phenomenon displayed by the actual network . here",
    ", we will demonstrate many of the non - smooth bifurcations predicted in the analysis are present in a full network of neurons .    unfortunately however , one can not easily simulate the large network of neurons in such a way as to expose unstable equilibria and limit cycles .",
    "for example , the equilibrium point @xmath133 is a saddle in the mean - field , and short of somehow initializing the network of neurons on the stable manifold of the saddle , it can not be resolved via direct simulations .",
    "however , the unstable node @xmath133 can be resolved by modifying the network as follows . using the separation of time scales between the fast variable @xmath20 , and the slow variable @xmath2",
    ", we replace the full network  by the following : @xmath313 for @xmath314 . here the dynamics of @xmath20 are replaced entirely by its steady state , large network solution : @xmath315 , with @xmath2 replaced by the finite mean @xmath316",
    ". we will refer to this network of neurons as the slow network .",
    "the resulting mean - field system for the slow network is simply a one - dimensional non - smooth ode , given by : @xmath317 the mean - field system for the slow network has the same steady states as the mean - field system for the full network , the two solutions @xmath318 , in addition to the non firing solution , @xmath319 .",
    "however , being a one dimensional system , no hopf bifurcations ( and thus oscillations ) are present in the mean - field system for the slow network .",
    "additionally , one can show that @xmath320 is always stable , and @xmath321 is always unstable as the eigenvalue for the steady state is given by @xmath322 the functions @xmath165 , and @xmath120 are identical to those for the mean - field system for the full network , thus we should expect that the slow network has a stable steady state , and undergoes a saddle node bifurcation as for the full network . as there can be no oscillations",
    ", we expect that @xmath320 exists and is stable for @xmath241 , and @xmath134 and @xmath196 , and @xmath323 .",
    "as the non - firing solution is also stable for @xmath130 , then we should expect bistability for @xmath243 .",
    "indeed , if we simulate the slow network with a slowly varying current that either decreases from current values greater then @xmath71 or increases from current values less then @xmath71 , we get bistability for @xmath196 and none for @xmath241 .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig11 ]    using the simulations of the slow network and the full network , we can piece together a pseudo - bifurcation diagram for the full network .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig12 ] .",
    "the boundary equilibrium bifurcations that occur near the vicinity of @xmath236 are both present for the actual network . given the similarities between the bifurcation diagram for the actual network , and that predicted by the non - smooth mean - field equations , it would appear that in order to understand the bifurcations that occur for these networks , one has to consider non - smooth bifurcation theory .",
    "one might wonder as to whether or not the non - smooth nature of the mean - field system is a direct result of the non - smooth nature of the neurons , given the fact that they have discrete resets and jumps .",
    "however , this is not the case . in particular",
    ", the firing rate of all type i neurons in the vicinity of the saddle - node on an invariant circle bifurcation is always proportional to @xmath324 .",
    "assuming that the dynamics of the neurons voltage is much faster then the dynamics of the all the other intrinsic and synaptic currents , one could obtain mean - field equations very similar to that obtained explicitly here .",
    "for example , this is done in the finite network case in the work of @xcite .",
    "thus , one has to consider non - smooth bifurcations and bifurcation analysis when working with mean - field systems for type i neurons .",
    "the same is true of type 2 neurons , however the firing rate for these neurons changes discontinuously at @xmath71 , and thus it is likely that the mean - field systems for type 2 neurons would be completely non - smooth , as opposed to piecewise smooth continuous .",
    "through our analysis of the mean field systems for large networks of coupled neurons , a number of new non - smooth bifurcations have been discovered that have been previously been unknown in the literature .",
    "these include two co - dimension 1 branches of boundary equilibrium bifurcations that have homoclinic limit cycles at the bifurcation point , and can be thought of as generating / destroying non - smooth limit cycles . additionally , a pair of co - dimension 2 bifurcations have also been discovered that result from the collision of classical smooth branches of bifurcations with non - smooth bifurcations .",
    "these occur when either a hopf equilibrium point , or a saddle - node equilibrium point collide with a switching manifold .",
    "we have determined locally in a neighbourhood of these bifurcation points the resulting behavior of the system through analytical and numerical results . additionally , a global - codimension 2 bifurcation and the collision of a bogdanov - takens equilibrium point with a switching manifold was also discovered by analyzing these systems , however we leave their analysis for later work .    given the analysis we have performed , then there are several predictions we can make , using the bifurcation curves for all the necessary branches .",
    "for example , it appears that the time scales @xmath221 and @xmath325 are crucial for determining the presence of bursting .",
    "if @xmath218 , then no bursting can occur , while if @xmath220 , there is a bell shaped region of bursting for @xmath134 , and @xmath207 .",
    "thus , if the adaptation time scale is smaller then the time scale of the synapses , adapting , recurrently coupled networks would not burst .",
    "this can be the case for example for weakly adapting neurons coupled together with nmda synapses , which have a long time scale .",
    "unfortunately however , while much of these bifurcations can be at least derived , one can not easily determine whether or not even the smooth bifurcations are generic in any sense .",
    "this is due to the fact that these particular systems can not be diagonalized very easily , due to the presence of the @xmath326 term , which has an unbounded derivative as @xmath327 .",
    "thus , center manifold theory can not be directly applied , and many of the genericity conditions can not be verified .",
    "in addition to these problems with regards to smooth bifurcations , one can not easily apply the existing non - smooth theory to these systems .",
    "the systems in the form @xmath328 are clearly piecewise smooth continuous , however unlike the vast majority of pwsc systems discussed in the literature , they fail to satisfy one critical constraint that these other systems have . in normal",
    "piecewise smooth continuous systems , given by @xmath329 where @xmath330 on @xmath331 , it is assumed that both @xmath332 and @xmath333 exists everywhere , and are smooth . in our system , @xmath326 only exists when @xmath334 and its first derivative only exists when @xmath254 .",
    "this renders much of the analysis on pwsc systems inapplicable .",
    "indeed , this system can not even be regularized in the normal way , via a teixeira type regularization scheme @xcite due to the fact that @xmath86 is undefined when @xmath335 .",
    "however , there are alternate ways to apply both center manifold theory , and simultaneously regularize this system . in particular , consider the three - dimensional system given by @xmath336 where @xmath337 is a small constant . in this singularly perturbed system",
    ", one can show that as @xmath338 , one recovers the piecewise smooth continuous system as when @xmath337 is small , we can regard @xmath20 and @xmath2 as fixed , and thus @xmath339 rapidly converges to the steady states @xmath82 , or @xmath86 , depending on the sign of @xmath340 .    using this type of embedded system , which is entirely polynomial for the izhikevich mean field system , one has regularized the non - smooth system in a sense by embedding it as the fast system in a singular perturbation problem .",
    "thus , to actually determine the genericity properties of the bifurcations displayed above , in addition to how the non - smooth bifurcations discovered are related to the general smooth bifurcation theory , one can analyze either directly or numerically the embedded system for finite @xmath337 .",
    "preliminarily , we have found that the hopf beb bifurcation seems to be a bautin point under the regularization , and the saddle - node beb bifurcation point seems to be a bogdanov - takens point under the regularization . these are both co - dimension 2 smooth bifurcation , and they also explain the emergence of the non - smooth saddle - node of periodics in the hopf beb , which has a smooth saddle - node of periodics .",
    "additionally , the regularized bogdanov - takens has ( generically ) a branch of homoclinic bifurcations , which also exists in a non - smooth form for the saddle - node beb .",
    "however , as the embedded system , and its justification as a regularization are outside of the scope of this paper , we leave it for future work .",
    "in addition to the embedded regularization , this system is also unusual in the sense that there is a natural regularization for the mean - field system .",
    "suppose we consider the voltage equations to be perturbed by white noise : @xmath341 where @xmath342 and @xmath343 . in which case one can rigorously derive a mean - field system for this network of equations which is identical to the original mean - field system given in equations ( [ mfa])-([mfc ] ) only the firing rate is now given by : @xmath344^{-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath345 is an anti - derivative ( in @xmath1 ) of @xmath346 .",
    "as we shall do in forthcoming work @xcite one can rigorously show that this expression for @xmath347 is smooth with respect to @xmath20 and @xmath2 , and always defined , and converges to ( [ mfc ] ) as @xmath348 .",
    "thus , the mean - field system for a network with noise parameterized by @xmath349 , the variance in the noise , converges to the system ( [ mfa])-([mfc ] ) as the variance of the noise becomes negligible .",
    "but , since the mean - field system with noise is smooth , it can be thought of as a natural regularization for the non - smooth mean - field system .",
    "we remark that this is unusual in the field of non - smooth theory as generally a regularization is chosen or suggested , and is typically of the teixeira form @xcite .",
    "we leave the bifurcation analysis of the system with noise for future work .",
    "finally , one may ask if the non - smooth bifurcations we analyze here appear in other non - smooth systems or are generic in any way . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the co - dimension 2 bifurcations are novel in the literature , according to a recent review @xcite .",
    "however , a hopf - bifurcation occuring on a discontinuity boundary ( a co - dimension 2 non - smooth bifurcation ) does occur in the example ( in section 6 ) in @xcite ( see figure 29 . ) .",
    "however , the system examined in @xcite is a fillipov system , and thus has a higher order of discontinuity .    as to whether these bifurcations occur in a more generic system , we intend to explore this further with a more generic piecewise smooth continuous system that does not have undefined derivatives on the switching manifolds .",
    "in particular , we note that with a quadratic pwsc system , one can show that as for our saddle - node beb bifurcation , at the intersection between generic branches of persistence and non - smooth fold beb bifurcations , the equilibrium of @xmath333 must have a zero eigenvalue at this co - dimension 2 point .",
