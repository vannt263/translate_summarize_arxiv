    "i thank my advisor louis crane for his guidance and for many exploratory conversations which , in particular , lead him to suggest the present topic as a thesis .",
    "working with him has taught me valuable lessons about perseverance and creative thinking in research .",

    "neill , larry weaver , and david yetter .",
    "special loving thanks to my mother .",
    "i dedicate this thesis in loving memory to my father , michael eugene westmoreland ; my brother , john kamin stewart ; and friends josh watson , chad hunter , ricky valenzuela .",
    "the underlying motivation of the present thesis is the idea of a mathematical connection between solitons and black holes .",
    "connections of this sort have been considered elsewhere , though not in the same context as the present thesis @xcite .",
    "we will study a particular system of nonlinear pdes , arising from the euler - heisenberg field equations ( ehfe ) , which we conjecture has solutions uniting solitonic and black hole - like properties .",
    "the ehfe derive from the euler - heisenberg effective lagrangian for quantum electrodynamics ; the solutions that we are interested in are optical black holes .",
    "the theory of solitons arises from the study of wave phenomena in nonlinear pdes .",
    "a soliton is a solitary traveling wave that maintains its shape through time .",
    "of particular importance for us is the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nse ) . in 1-dimension , for a complex wave amplitude @xmath0 with coupling constant @xmath1 , the nse has the canonical form ( e.g. , sulem and sulem @xcite pp . 5 , 20 , drazin and johnson @xcite pp .",
    "34 - 35 ) : @xmath2      a _ spacetime _ is a 4-dimensional pseudo - riemannian manifold .",
    "the key equation in general relativity is the einstein field equation ( efe ) , which unfolds to give a system of nonlinear pdes .",
    "solving these pdes allows one to express the metric coefficients @xmath3 of spacetime in terms of the stress - energy tensor @xmath4 . with",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath5 included , the efe reads ( hawking and ellis @xcite p. 74 ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is newton s gravitational constant and the speed of light is set equal to 1 .",
    "the einstein tensor @xmath8 can be expressed in terms of the ricci tensor @xmath9 , the scalar @xmath10 , and the metric @xmath3 : @xmath11    among the known exact solutions to ( [ efe1 ] ) are those describing black holes .",
    "a black hole is a region of spacetime where future - directed outgoing null geodesics can not escape .",
    "a white hole is a region of spacetime where future - directed ingoing null geodesics can not enter .",
    "the boundary of a black ( or white ) hole is called an event horizon .",
    "we use these definitions even outside the context of general relativity . for us , any pseudo - riemannian manifold will be called a spacetime whether it satisfies the efe or not , and one can ask whether or not a given spacetime has black holes .",
    "quantum electrodynamics can be approximated as an effective field theory governed by the euler - heisenberg lagrangian ( cf .",
    "euler and heisenberg @xcite , schwinger @xcite , novello @xcite p. 292",
    ", boer and van holten @xcite ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the poincar invariants of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the speed of light , the reduced planck constant , the mass of the electron , and the permittivity of free space are here set equal to 1 . applying the principle of least action to ( [ ehl1 ] ) leads to the euler - heisenberg field equation ( ehfe ) : @xmath16 here",
    ", @xmath17 is the electromagnetic field tensor , @xmath18 is its dual , and @xmath19 represents the covariant derivative with respect to the coordinate @xmath20 , using the connection determined by the background spacetime metric .",
    "note that ( [ ehfe1 ] ) is , in general , yet another system of nonlinear pdes .    according to the euler - heisenberg effective field theory",
    ", the vacuum behaves like a nonlinear physical medium .",
    "light rays passing through electromagnetic fields are bent as if they were passing through water , thus affecting the apparent geometry of objects .",
    "this motivates the idea that the effective field theory can be interpreted geometrically .",
    "indeed , novello @xcite has shown in a seminal work that light rays ( small disturbances traveling through the field ) follow null geodesics with respect to a spacetime metric @xmath21 distinct from the background metric @xmath3 .",
    "this is called the effective metric .",
    "the inverse ( or cometric ) @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of the stress - energy tensor of the electromagnetic field : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are special functions of the poincar invariants @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( see equation ( [ effcometricset ] ) ) .",
    "this geometrical interpretation of effective field theory demonstrates an analogy between nonlinear optics and general relativity , with equation ( [ novellogeometricequation ] ) playing the role of the einstein field equation ( [ efe1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "let us note two subtleties .",
    "( 1 ) the effective metric is uniquely determined only up to a conformal factor .",
    "( 2 ) since light in the nonlinear vacuum experiences birefringence , a given electromagnetic field actually carries two distinct effective metrics ; one for each polarization state .",
    "our main proposal is that the ehfe ( [ ehfe1 ] ) has soliton solutions with a corresponding effective geometry containing a black hole . in this sense",
    ", the ehfe would be somewhat in between the nse ( [ nse1 ] ) and the efe ( [ efe1 ] ) .",
    "we have a theorem and a conjecture :    [ mainthm ] there is an exact static solution to the euler - heisenberg field equations where the effective geometries of each polarization state have black holes .",
    "[ mainconj ] there is an exact solution to the euler - heisenberg field equations which is a soliton and whose effective geometries have black holes .",
    "the theorem is proven in section [ proofmaintheorem ] .",
    "the soliton of the conjecture is , we believe , an imploding solitonic wave .",
    "evidence for this belief is discussed in the section below .",
    "the purist will note that the hypothetical  imploding soliton \" can not strictly be a soliton as a soliton does not change its shape . as the soliton in the conjecture implodes",
    ", it will become more concentrated and lose its initial shape .",
    "however , in cylindrical coordinates @xmath26 , for a cylindrically symmetric wave approaching the axis @xmath27 , we conjecture that its radial cross section will keep its shape if multiplied by @xmath28 .",
    "evidence in support of the conjecture comes from nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "in particular , soljai and segev @xcite have examined the behavior of a beam resulting from the perpendicular collision of two plane waves in the euler - heisenberg vacuum . using approximations",
    ", they determined that the amplitude of the resulting beam satisfies the nse ( [ nse1 ] ) .",
    "since an imploding wave can be thought of as a limiting case of infinitely many colliding plane waves , it seems reasonable to expect that the nse should be obtained in the case of an imploding wave .    in the work of brodin _",
    "@xcite , which nicely complements soljai and segev s paper , a beam guided between two parallel conducting planes is studied .",
    "it was found that the amplitude of this beam satisfies a 2-dimensional cylindrically symmetric nse . according to brodin _",
    "@xcite , for a beam with a certain critical intensity @xmath29 , the dispersive and self - focusing effects exactly balance and the beam forms an optical soliton of constant width .",
    "if the intensity @xmath30 of the beam is less than @xmath29 , then the beam width diffracts without bound .",
    "if @xmath31 , then the beam width collapses to zero in a finite time .",
    "these results from nonlinear optics show that there is an authentic link between the ehfe and the nse , which at least partly supports conjecture [ mainconj ] .",
    "another piece of evidence for the conjecture comes from the work of section [ maxwellianapproximation ] . the maxwellian approximation ,",
    "although it is only a first - order approximation to a solution to the ehfe , it gives information on the coordinate velocities of effective geodesics up to second - order ( see theorem [ justificationofma ] ) .",
    "when we look at the coordinate velocities of the outgoing geodesics to second - order , we find that they are trapped within a certain radius .",
    "( there is a black hole . )    since conjecture [ mainconj ] concerns solutions of a nonlinear variational problem , we suspect that its proof will use tools from morse theory ( i.e. , the calculus of variations in the large ) .",
    "this thesis is organized as follows .",
    "chapter [ chapter1 ] is a pedestrian introduction to the required mathematical physics .",
    "chapter [ chapter2 ] is a self - contained review of novello s theory of effective geometry . in chapter [ planewaves ] ( which can be omitted on a first reading )",
    ", we study the effective geometry of plane waves , and calculate the index of refraction through a plane wave confirming earlier approximations done by others using different methods . in chapter",
    "[ chapter4 ] , we use well - known solutions from maxwell s theory ( for imploding cylindrically symmetric waves ) and investigate the corresponding effective geometries which resemble black holes . at the end of chapter [ chapter4 ] , we prove theorem [ mainthm ] by explicitly finding an exact solution to the ehfe with the required properties .",
    "although this exact solution is static , it shares some similarities with an ingoing cylindrical wave solution because its poynting vector points radially inward .",
    "the present chapter is meant to be a self - contained pedestrian introduction to the relevant mathematical physics .      according to quantum electrodynamics",
    ", photons can scatter off of each other .",
    "this photon - photon scattering effect , also known as the nonlinearity of the vacuum , was calculated by euler and heisenberg @xcite in the mid-1930s , but it is so subtle that no currently available experiment is yet sensitive enough to measure it .",
    "photon - photon scattering arises from processes that involve virtual electron - positron pairs ( see figure [ photonphotondiagram ] ) . in the classical limit",
    ", the effect of these virtual particles on real photons can be approximated by introducing nonlinear terms to the maxwellian lagrangian . in this so - called effective field theory , the photons do not necessarily follow null geodesics in the background metric . instead , they follow null geodesics with respect to a so - called effective metric , as will be explained in chapter [ chapter2 ] .      in a curved background , according to drummond and hathrell @xcite , the physical lagrangian for the effective field theory acquires a nontrivial dependence on the spacetime curvature . in the present thesis , we restrict ourselves to a minkowskian background ,",
    "so these curvature coupling effects can be ignored .",
    "the background metric tensor is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "its inverse , the so - called _ cometric , _ is denoted @xmath32 and one has that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the kronecker delta ( and the einstein summation convention is followed as usual ) .",
    "the present work uses the @xmath35 signature convention .",
    "recall that a given metric determines a unique torsion - free connection @xmath36 by requiring that the covariant derivative of the metric be zero ( e.g. hawking and ellis @xcite p. 40 , or spivak @xcite pp .",
    "236 - 237 ) : @xmath37the connection coefficients @xmath38 ( christoffel symbols ) thus determined are given by : @xmath39where the operator @xmath40 denotes partial differentiation with respect to the @xmath20 coordinate .",
    "i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "the electromagnetic field @xmath42 is a closed 2-form , and locally there exists an @xmath43-field @xmath44 such that : @xmath45    note the bianchi identity : @xmath46    the antisymmetrization of an indexed quantity is indicated by placing square brackets around indices . for example , given the tensor @xmath47 , we can write : @xmath48}=\\frac{1}{n!}\\sum_{\\sigma } \\textrm{sgn}(\\sigma)t_{\\sigma(\\alpha_1)\\sigma(\\alpha_2)\\cdots \\sigma(\\alpha_n)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over all permutations @xmath49 of the indices @xmath50 .",
    "the value of @xmath51 is @xmath52 if @xmath49 is an even permutation of the sequence @xmath53 and is @xmath54 if @xmath49 is an odd permutation .",
    "using antisymmetrization , equation ( [ bianchi ] ) can be written as : @xmath55 } \\",
    "(= \\nabla_{[\\lambda}f_{\\mu\\nu]}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the levi - civita tensor @xmath56 is defined such that : @xmath57},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 denotes the determinant of the metric @xmath3 .",
    "note that the value of @xmath56 is @xmath59 unless the indices @xmath60 are all distinct .",
    "furthermore , note that @xmath56 is @xmath61 if the sequence @xmath62 is an even permutation of the sequence 0123 and is @xmath63 if @xmath62 is an odd permutation .",
    "the levi - civita tensor allows us to express the hodge dual of @xmath42 by writing : @xmath64 unless otherwise specified ( e.g. , in section [ nullgeo ] ) , indices are always raised or lowered with respect to the _ background _ metric .",
    "so , e.g. , @xmath65 .",
    "note that the bianchi identity ( [ bianchi ] ) can be expressed in terms of the dual tensor by writing ( cf .",
    "landau and lifshitz @xcite p. 67 ) : @xmath66      the physical behavior of the electromagnetic field is governed by a lagrangian @xmath67 which is a scalar function of the field @xmath44 , its covariant derivatives @xmath68 , and the background metric .",
    "the field equations are obtained from the principle of least action : @xmath69    in the case of maxwell s theory , the lagrangian in the absence of charges and currents ( a field in the vacuum ) can be written out as : @xmath70 if we define @xmath71 , then equation ( [ maxwellslagrangian ] ) simplifies to @xmath72 . using ( [ eulerlagrangeeqns ] ) , one recovers the familiar form of maxwell s equation for the vacuum : @xmath73    the quantity @xmath14 introduced here is a scalar invariant of the electromagnetic field tensor .",
    "in fact , there are only two algebraically independent scalar invariants for @xmath42 .",
    "these are represented by the so - called _ poincar invariants _ @xmath71 and @xmath74 ( landau and lifshitz @xcite p. 64 ) .",
    "we define the class of _ @xmath75-theories _ as electromagnetic theories in which the lagrangian @xmath67 can be expressed in terms of the poincar scalars @xmath14 and @xmath15 alone , i.e. , @xmath76 .",
    "it is assumed that the partial derivatives of @xmath76 , with respect to @xmath14 and @xmath15 , exist at least up to second - order , and that they are continuous .",
    "we will use the notations @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , etc .",
    "we observe that @xmath75-theories are guaranteed to be lorentz invariant since both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are lorentz invariant quantities .",
    "a particularly important @xmath75-theory is the euler - heisenberg theory ( to be introduced in section [ ehlagrangiansection ] ) .",
    "chapter [ chapter2 ] is primarily concerned not with a particular theory but with general @xmath75-theories .",
    "however , in subsequent chapters , attention is restricted to the euler - heisenberg theory .",
    "although effective field theories more elaborate than the @xmath75-type can be constructed by writing lagrangians that include terms involving the covariant derivatives of the field ( e.g. , terms like @xmath82 ) @xcite , we will not deal with such things in the present work .",
    "euler - heisenberg theory is an effective field theory which approximates the physical theory of quantum electrodynamics in minkowski spacetime .",
    "up to second order in the fine - structure constant @xmath13 , the _ euler - heisenberg lagrangian _ is given by ( cf .",
