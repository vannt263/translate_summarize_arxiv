    "the formation of the first stars marks the beginnings of structure formation , cosmic reionization , and chemical enrichment ( e.g. , @xcite and references within ) .",
    "these so - called population iii stars formed out of metal - free primordial gas at the centers of dark matter minihalos @xcite . due to relatively weak feedback and inefficient cooling , they had high characteristic masses of order at least tens of solar masses and therefore short life spans ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although the short lives of population iii stars implies that they can not be directly observed anymore , it is believed that the metals released in their supernovae trigger a transition from predominantly high mass star formation to a low mass mode @xcite .",
    "the chemical abundances of low - mass , metal - poor population ii stars in the milky way stellar halo have been interpreted as traces of the population iii star era ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then an understanding of the formation process for population ii stars is one way to probe the epoch of the first stars @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the formation of population iii stars , whose gas properties and formation environments are relatively well - understood , the conditions for population ii star formation are quite uncertain ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "introducing even trace amounts of metals significantly affects the thermal behavior of collapsing gas clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are also many possible candidate environments that might be the formation sites of these stars , ranging from the atomic cooling halos of the first protogalaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) to post - supernova shock regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the two main theories for how metals cause low mass star formation are gas cooling through atomic fine structure lines @xcite and gas fragmentation induced by dust continuum radiation ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". we will refer to these as `` fine structure cooling '' and `` dust cooling '' , respectively .",
    "fine structure cooling argues that in the absence of sufficient atomic metal line cooling , gas clouds can not quickly collapse beyond a `` loitering state '' of @xmath3@xmath4 and @xmath5k @xcite .",
    "the presence of molecular hydrogen may smooth out this metallicity threshold ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but only if there is no soft uv lyman - werner ( lw ) background produced by the first stars , capable of destroying molecular hydrogen @xcite .",
    "arguably , the presence of such a lw background is natural , as the same stars that produced the first heavy elements would also emit lw radiation ; thus , the fine - structure threshold is clearly imprinted , without h@xmath6 cooling smoothing it out .",
    "if the gas metallicity is above a critical metallicity of @xmath7 , the gas is unstable to vigorous fragmentation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most important atomic species are carbon and oxygen @xcite , so the theory predicts enhancements in these elements .",
    "if correct , this is a natural explanation for the measured carbon enhancement in many metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "however , the jeans mass of gas fragments formed by just fine structure cooling is @xmath8 , which is too massive for a star formed early in the universe to survive until the present day @xcite .",
    "in contrast , dust cooling easily causes gas fragmentation at jeans masses of @xmath9 because it becomes efficient only at high gas densities and temperatures around @xmath10 @xmath4 and @xmath11k .",
    "the critical metallicity required for dust cooling to cause fragmentation is also much lower at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this dust must have been formed in early supernovae @xcite .",
    "many dust models have been produced which turn supernova yields into dust masses ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most of these models assume steady - state chemistry and use classical nucleation theory to calculate dust yields .",
    "these approximations may not applicable in a supernova outflow environment @xcite , although see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , significant amounts of dust can also be destroyed in supernova reverse shocks @xcite .",
    "the large difference in the critical metallicity between these two cooling mechanisms has sparked some debate about which one is most relevant for the formation of low - mass metal - poor stars .",
    "this can be observationally tested , as the relevant cooling mechanisms should leave an imprint on the observed chemical abundances .",
    "@xcite observationally tested the fine structure cooling theory by introducing the transition discriminant @xmath13 .",
    "they predicted that metal - poor stars forming through this mechanism must have @xmath14 .",
    "nearly all stars satisfy this criterion ( see @xcite for an updated @xmath13 figure ) . the only star known to violate the @xmath13 criterion is sdss  j1029151 + 1729 @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that dust cooling was instead able to explain the formation of this star . more generally , @xcite calculate a critical dust - to - gas ratio ( @xmath15 ) that could in principle place an observational restriction on dust cooling , similar to the @xmath13 restriction on fine structure cooling .",
    "however , for metal - poor stars besides sdss  j1029151 + 1729 , the impact of dust cooling has not been evaluated in detail .",
    "ideally , there would be general properties of supernova dust that could be tested with observations of abundances in metal - poor stars .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that when accounting for non - equilibrium chemical kinetics in dust formation , dust yields are significantly lower and dominated by silicon - based grains , rather than the carbon grains that are typical results of most steady - state models .",
    "there is some debate about the extent to which carbon dust formation is suppressed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , if indeed carbon dust formation is generally suppressed in the early universe , the silicon abundance of metal - poor stars could be used as an observational constraint on dust cooling processes .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the impact that silicon - based dust could have had on the formation process of the first low - mass stars . using the silicon - based dust compositions from @xcite ,",
    "we compute critical silicon abundances and compare them to observations of chemical abundances in long - lived metal - poor stars . in section  [ section : dustmodelintro ] , we describe the dust models used for this paper . in section  [ section : critical ] , we calculate critical silicon abundances for our dust models , assessing how differences in chemistry , grain size distribution , and environment affect this critical threshold .",
    "our main results are found in section  [ section : data ] , where we compare our critical silicon abundances to measurements of metal - poor stars .",
    "section  [ section : dustvsfs ] considers evidence for two distinct formation pathways of low - mass metal - poor stars , and section  [ section : dla ] discusses the potential for damped lyman-@xmath16 systems to help constrain the star formation environments . after outlining important caveats in section  [ section : caveats ] ( particularly related to the production of carbon dust ) , we conclude in section  [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "we first present the dust models used in this paper in section  [ section : dustmodels ] .",
    "we then discuss some processes in these dust models which strongly inhibit carbon dust formation in section  [ section : whynocarbon ] .",
    "we use the eight different silicon - based dust chemistries presented in @xcite .",
    "we assume these are representative of typical dust yields in the early universe .",
    "the dust masses are given in table  [ tbl:1 ] .",
    "although the eight different models represent different assumptions about the nature of the supernovae and the dust condensation process , we simply take them as plausible variations in the chemical composition of dust .",
    "the dominant dust species are sio@xmath6 , mg@xmath6sio@xmath17 , amorphous si , and fes .    for our calculations in section  [ section :",
    "dustcooling ] , we require a dust grain size distribution . however , @xcite do not compute grain size distributions for their dust models .",
    "we thus consider two simple but well - motivated grain size distributions .",
    "the first is a @xcite `` standard '' size distribution .",
    "this was used in @xcite , and it is similar to the milky way grain size distribution used in @xcite . for spherical dust grains of radius @xmath18 : @xmath19 we also consider a grain size distribution that approximates the effect of running a post - supernova reverse shock through newly created dust , based on the size distributions calculated in @xcite : @xmath20 from now on , we will refer to these two grain size distributions as the `` standard '' and `` shock '' size distributions . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that each type of dust grain has the same grain size distribution , though it may also be possible to calculate a good approximation to the grain size distribution using classical nucleation theory @xcite .",
    "we normalize the size distributions to number of particles per unit dust mass ( @xmath21 g@xmath22 ) by using the amount of dust mass formed and the solid - phase chemical density of each type of dust @xcite .",
    "we use the @xcite dust models to establish a critical silicon criterion ( section  [ section : sicrit ] ) .",
    "thus , our results crucially depend on the assumption that the dust composition is largely silicon - based .",
    "the most significant non - silicate dust is typically amorphous carbon .",
    "we thus briefly describe why carbon dust formation is almost completely inhibited in these models .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a more extensive discussion .    the chemical mechanisms that inhibit carbon dust formation depend on the c / o ratio in the supernova ejecta .",
    "when the c / o ratio is less than one , co formation rapidly depletes the available carbon .",
    "although there are processes that can destroy this supply of co and form short carbon chains , subsequent oxidation of these chains inhibits dust formation .",
    "this effect is seen despite accounting for non - thermal processes such as the destruction of co through high energy compton electrons @xcite .",
    "when the c / o ratio is greater than one , small carbon clusters can form but are rapidly destroyed by the he@xmath23 ions that accompany large amounts of carbon .    in radial distributions of supernova ejecta ,",
    "carbon is always accompanied by large oxygen or helium abundances ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , if the supernovae ejecta is poorly mixed at a microscopic level , then carbon rich clouds may form significant amounts of carbon dust in addition to silicate dust @xcite .",
    "thus , the suppression of carbon dust may heavily depend on the level of mixing , which itself depends on the details of the supernova explosion",
    ".    we will follow the assumption of microscopically - mixed supernova ejecta as in @xcite , which leads to silicate dust being the dominant form of dust in the early universe .",
    "a major motivation for investigating the consequences of silicon - based dust is that silicon abundances measured from the most metal - poor stars are comparable to the theoretical critical silicon abundances we derive in section  [ section : sicrit ] , thus offering an empirical test of this important assumption .",
    "for completeness , in section  [ section : cdust ] , we also explore the impact that the formation of carbon dust would have on our results .",
    "in this section , we present the method for calculating the critical silicon abundance ( @xmath1}_{\\text{crit}}$ ] ) required for gas fragmentation . we use a simplified model that only considers dust thermal cooling and adiabatic compressional heating .",
    "many previous papers have studied these in detail , using a more comprehensive set of cooling mechanisms that influence a large range of gas densities ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to derive the critical silicon abundance , we focus on the density regime where dust cooling dominates .    in section  [ section : dustcooling ]",
    "we show how we calculate the dust cooling rate for a given dust model . in section  [ section : dcrit ]",
    "we use the cooling rate to calculate a critical dust - to - gas ratio @xcite , which we convert to a critical silicon abundance in section  [ section : sicrit ] . in section",
    "[ section : environments ] , we discuss uncertainties in the population ii star forming environment and the implications this may have for our critical silicon abundance .",
    "we describe how to calculate the gas cooling rate due to dust emission .",
    "this calculation closely follows the method in @xcite . for completeness and convenience of the reader",
    ", we here give a brief summary .",

    "although the carbon and oxygen abundances derived from 3d models have abundance corrections of order @xmath117dex , the available 3d iron and silicon abundances appear to be within @xmath118dex of the 1d abundances @xcite .",

    "these stars all have silicon abundances that fall below the critical lines for the standard size distribution , showing that they could not have formed from gas cooled by silicon - based dust of this size distribution .",
    "furthermore , he  0107@xmath1155240 and he  1327@xmath1152326 have silicon upper limits that are even slightly below the critical silicon abundances derived from the shock size distribution .",
    "this suggests that both of these stars did not form because of the agency of silicon - based dust cooling at all , but instead relied on some other mechanism to enable low - mass star formation .",
    "the star he  1424@xmath1150241 is also interesting because of an abnormally low silicon abundance , @xmath114}=-1.00 $ ] , despite its somewhat higher iron abundance ( @xmath2}=-3.96 $ ] ; @xcite ) compared to the stars described above .",

    "this star is shown as the black pentagon in figure [ fig : sih ] .",

    "while this is certainly interesting in the context of testing for cooling mechanisms , it may be possible that this star s abundance pattern does not reflect nucleosynthesis products of typical supernovae , as such a low si abundance has never before been found in similar metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "there is another interesting star with low iron , sdss  j1029151 + 1729 ( @xcite , @xmath2}=-4.73 $ ] , black diamond in figure  [ fig : sih ] ) .",
    "it has @xmath1 } = -4.3 $ ] which places it above the critical silicon values for all of our models .",
    "this star is also not carbon - enhanced ( see further discussion in section  [ section : dustvsfs ] ) and it has previously been suggested that this star formed from dust - cooled gas @xcite .",
    "our results agree with this finding .",
    "overall , from figure  [ fig : sih ] , it is apparent that within our framework , the four stars falling beneath the standard size distribution s critical silicon abundances are unable to have formed in a cloud cooled by silicate dust with a milky way grain size distribution .",
    "thus , the fragmentation seen in simulations using metallicity - scaled milky way dust ( e.g. , @xcite ) can not explain the formation of these four stars of @xmath128 for the standard size distribution .",
    "the milky way dust - to - gas ratio is @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "thus , when scaling by @xmath130 this is above @xmath15 , but when scaling by @xmath131 this is below @xmath15 .",
    "this matches the simulation results of @xcite and @xcite . ] .",
    "it follows that either this type of dust is not an accurate model of dust in the early universe , or that the presence of such dust in early gas clouds was subject to stochastic events ( e.g. , individual supernovae ) , only rarely leading to the cooling required for star formation to occur .",
    "in section  [ section : data ] , and assuming the suppression of carbon - based dust , we found that some stars apparently can not form from gas cooled by only silicon - based dust . in a broader context , it is then interesting to consider the relative importance of dust thermal cooling and carbon / oxygen fine structure line cooling .",
    "we can derive new constraints on a star s formation process by considering its silicon abundance in conjunction with @xmath13 from @xcite .",
    "hence , we calculate @xmath13 for our star sample with the updated formula from @xcite : @xmath132}}+0.9 \\times 10^{\\mbox{[o / h]}})\\ ] ] to emphasize our notation , note the difference between @xmath56 which represents a dust - to - gas ratio , and @xmath13 which is the transition discriminant of @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : dtranssih ] , we show @xmath13 as a function of the silicon abundance . stars that have both carbon and oxygen abundances available are plotted in black .",
    "following @xcite , stars missing either carbon or oxygen are plotted in red , with a vertical bar denoting the @xmath13 range corresponding to @xmath133[c / o]@xmath134 .",
    "the four stars with the lowest silicon abundances appear to all have large carbon abundances , placing them above the critical @xmath13 value of @xmath135 .",
    "sdss  j1029151 + 1729 however has a relatively high silicon abundance ( at @xmath1 } = -4.3 $ ] ) and a low carbon abundance placing it below the critical @xmath136 level .",
    "this combination of low si / high c and high si / low c abundances is an interesting finding which warrants further exploration in future work .",
    "however , if dust in the early universe is silicon - based , then the currently available data suggest a bifurcation in the dominant cooling mechanisms of the gas clouds that produced these low - mass stars .",
    "this lends support to the arguments made by @xcite who suggest different paths of star formation for carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars ( @xmath137 } > 0.7 $ ] ) and those that do not show such a significant overabundance of carbon relative to iron .",
    "after all , nearly a quarter of extremely metal - poor stars with @xmath2 } < -2.5 $ ] are carbon - enhanced ( e.g. , @xcite ) , with the carbon - rich fraction increasing with decreasing [ fe / h ] .     vs @xmath1}$ ] for our sample of stars using 1d lte abundances .",
    "the shaded red and green bars are the range of critical silicon abundances shown in figure [ fig : sih ] .",
    "the critical @xmath13 value and errors are shown as dashed and dotted horizontal black lines .",
    "the four stars that fall to the left of the green bar likely can not form through dust cooling , while the star that falls below the dashed line likely can not form through fine structure cooling .",
    "this is evidence that both dust cooling and fine structure cooling can be relevant for low mass star formation .",
    "it is also tentative evidence that fine structure cooling and dust cooling are mutually exclusive .",
    "[ fig : dtranssih],width=340 ]    we thus further examine the physics driving these two potential pathways , which may guide future work towards clarifying emerging bimodal picture of first low - mass star formation .",
    "we start by considering gas collapse within an atomic cooling halo @xcite . here",
    ", a bifurcation occurs into two different pathways depending on the fragmentation properties of the gas . a schematic view of these two pathways is shown in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .    in the first pathway , a large collapsing gas cloud undergoes vigorous fragmentation into many medium - mass clumps @xcite .",
    "the presence of a lw background from the first stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) prevents molecular hydrogen from dominating the cooling rate , and thus fine structure cooling is required to enable fragmentation at these intermediate densities @xcite .",
    "the result is a strongly clustered star formation mode , where typical stars may grow to masses @xmath138 , but also leading to a retinue of lower - mass cluster members .",
    "specifically , many - body gravitational interactions may eject some of these protostars from their parent clouds , thus shutting - off further accretion , so that they remain at low masses .",
    "we call this mode the `` dynamic pathway '' , which could be reflected in the carbon - enhanced metal - poor stars .",
    "alternatively , the atomic carbon may condense into dust grains at high densities , inducing gas fragmentation @xcite .",
    "the second pathway involves monolithic collapse of a jeans - unstable gas cloud . in the absence of significant fine - structure cooling",
    ", the gas just continues to collapse until a protostellar disk forms at the center of the cloud ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the lw background prevents fragmentation at intermediate densities from molecular hydrogen cooling @xcite . in the disk , the density is high enough for dust cooling to be significant , and the disk fragments into low - mass clumps @xcite .",
    "we call this the `` thermal pathway '' and note that rotation support is critical for providing an environment that is stable for longer than the gravitational free fall time @xcite .",
    "although the lw background inhibits fragmentation from molecular cooling , it is possible that other processes could cause additional fragmentation away from the center of the halo .",
    "for example , a shell instability in a supernova shock may cause fragmentation , creating additional star clusters in the atomic cooling halo ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    while our two - pathway interpretation is still largely qualitative at this stage",
    ", the current body of metal - poor stellar abundance data can only be satisfactorily explained with such different star formation processes occuring in the early universe .",
    "future modeling of gas cooling and metal mixing processes will shed more light on the matter .",

    "there has also been evidence that gas may remain very pristine at lower redshifts as well @xcite .",
    "we show the chemical abundances of the three most iron - poor dlas from @xcite and the upper limits from @xcite as blue hexagons in figures [ fig : sih ] and [ fig : dtranssih ] .",
    "the three dlas from @xcite have abundances that fall within the scatter of the more metal - rich stars of our sample , which is consistent with the interpretation that these dlas could be the formation sites of the metal - poor stars in our halo .",
    "the dla candidate from @xcite has abundance limits at the critical values of both the fine structure and dust cooling criteria .",
    "this could be interpreted such that neither dust nor fine - structure line cooling have operated in this system , leading to no low - mass star formation .",
    "however , the nature of this dla remains somewhat ambiguous @xcite , so this interpretation may need to be revised .",
    "future observations of metal - poor dlas will show whether additional systems can be found with such low abundances , and whether any will be below the critical silicon and carbon / oxygen abundances as presented in this paper .",
    "in fact , more metal - poor dla s would greatly help to further constrain the formation environment of the most metal - poor stars in the milky way halo .",
    "the most important assumption in our work is that dust in the early universe is largely silicon - based .",
    "if large amounts of non - silicate dust is produced , then the critical silicon abundance may not be suitable for testing dust cooling with the most metal - poor stars .",
    "in particular , as mentioned in section  [ section : whynocarbon ] and discussed in @xcite , significant amounts of carbon dust may form if carbon - rich regions are not microscopically mixed with helium ions in the supernova ejecta .",
    "@xcite calculate an upper limit on carbon dust produced in this situation by assuming no mixing between the carbon and helium layers .",
    "95% of the carbon - rich / oxygen - poor layer is depleted for a total of @xmath139 of carbon dust , or about 10% of the final dust mass in dust models 1 and 2 .",
    "the level of mixing , and thus how much carbon dust is produced , depends on many variables including the nature of the supernova .",

    "silicon is no longer a useful element for empirically evaluating the role of dust .    in principle",
    ", the methodology described in section  [ section : sicrit ] could be applied to derive critical abundances for carbon dust .",
    "an upper limit on the critical carbon abundance can be found by assuming pure carbon dust .",
    "we find @xmath142}_{\\rm crit , max } \\sim-4.9 $ ] for the standard size distribution and @xmath143 for the shock size distribution .",
    "these thresholds are so low that falsifying a carbon dust theory is observationally intractable at the present time .",
    "we estimate that @xmath142 } \\lesssim -5 $ ] could be measured for a suitable bright , cool ( @xmath144k ) giant if the signal - to - noise is over 300 .",
    "this is at the edge of current telescope capabilities , but spectrographs on the next generation of extremely large telescopes ( e.g. , gclef on gmt ) should enable observations of extremely low carbon abundances .",
    "thus , although testing carbon dust with a critical carbon criterion is currently impractical , it may be accessible in the future .          unlike @xcite , we do not fit separate supernovae yields to individual stellar abundance patterns .",
    "however , we have verified that the supernovae abundances fall within the abundance range of known metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "different supernova yields would affect the dust compositions computed by the @xcite models .",
    "in particular , if the ejecta were to be very abundant in carbon , regions of unmixed carbon are more probable and thus larger amounts of carbon dust would form .",
    "we chose two simple grain size distributions to derive our critical silicon abundances instead of calculating them specifically for our dust models .",
    "in doing so , we made the simplifying assumption that all types of dust follow the same size distribution .",
    "this assumption is likely not accurate as different chemical species condense to different initial sizes and undergo different amounts of destruction in a supernova reverse shock ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since different grain chemical species may not be in thermal equilibrium with each other due to their low density , it may be important to treat grain types separately instead of lumping them together into a single dust model as is typically done in the literature as well as in this paper .",
    "we also note that although smaller dust grains lead to more efficient gas cooling , the supernova reverse shocks generally responsible for breaking up dust grains also completely destroy a significant fraction of the dust @xcite .",
    "we did not consider grain growth , which can create significantly more dust @xcite .",
    "however , at low metallicities , this is not important for our fiducial density of @xmath145@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we also neglected the effect of increased h@xmath6 formation on the surfaces of dust grains .",
    "however , the increased h@xmath6 cooling should be roughly balanced by the heat released in forming h@xmath6 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we do not expect that including this effect would significantly change the critical silicon abundances , but it may be relevant for causing additional fragmentation in the thermal pathway @xcite .",
    "we have computed critical silicon abundances using the silicon - based dust models in @xcite .",
    "we found that different dust chemical compositions introduce only small variations ( @xmath146 dex ) in the critical silicon abundance , but assumptions about the size distribution can produce an order of magnitude difference , with smaller grains being much more effective at cooling the gas ( figure  [ fig : sizedistr ] ) . at the densities and temperatures associated with protostellar disks ,",
    "the critical silicon abundance is @xmath1}=-4.5 \\pm 0.1 $ ] for a standard milky way grain size distribution and @xmath1}=   -5.3 \\pm 0.1 $ ] for a shocked grain size distribution .",
    "other population  ii star forming environments are not likely to be influenced by dust because their densities are too low .",
    "we then compare our critical silicon abundances to chemical abundances of metal - poor stars . for the standard milky way grain size distribution , four of the nine stars with @xmath2 } < -4.0 $ ] and three of the four stars with @xmath2 } \\lesssim -4.5 $ ] have silicon abundances too low to be explained by silicon - based dust cooling . all stars that can not form through silicon - based dust cooling satisfy the @xmath13 criterion , with the possible exception of he  1424@xmath1150241 .",
    "( figures  [ fig : sih ] and  [ fig : dtranssih ] ) .",
    "in fact , two stars have silicon abundances below even the critical silicon abundances for the shocked size distribution , suggesting that silicon - based dust may not have played a dominant role in their formation . with the caution required in interpreting a small sample of stars",
    ", we thus see hints of two distinct pathways for the formation of low - mass metal - poor stars in the early universe .",
    "one pathway depends on fine structure cooling , and the other depends on dust cooling ( figure  [ fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "the most important uncertainty in this analysis is the production of carbon dust , which can occur if carbon - rich regions of supernova ejecta are not microscopically mixed with helium ions .",
    "if significant amounts of carbon dust can form , the critical silicon abundance will decrease ( figure  [ fig : carbfrac ] ) .",
    "if carbon dust is less than 20% of the total dust mass , the critical silicon abundances shift by less than 0.2 dex and our comparison with data is not significantly affected . however",
    ", if more of the dust is in carbon , the critical silicon abundance may not be a good criterion to evaluate dust cooling and our interpretation of figures  [ fig : sih ] and  [ fig : dtranssih ] may need revisiting . a more complete understanding of microscopic mixing and dust formation in population iii supernova ejecta may allow us to better determine a carbon dust fraction .",
    "given these results , we note that many potentially interesting metal - poor stars in the literature do not have silicon abundances measured .",
