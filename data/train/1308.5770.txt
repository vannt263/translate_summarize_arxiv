    "one of the most significant astronomical observation in the last decade is the accelerated expansion of the universe [ 1 - 14 ] .",
    "one way to explain this accelerating phase of the universe expansion is invoking a dark energy component in the matter sector of the einstein field equations [ 15 - 31 ] .",
    "however , it is possible also to modify the geometric part of the field equations to achieve this goal [ 32 - 45 ] . in the spirit of the second viewpoint , braneworld model proposed by dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) provides a natural explanation of late - time accelerated expansion in its self - accelerating branch of the solutions [ 46 - 51 ] .",
    "unfortunately , the self - accelerating branch of this scenario suffers from ghost instabilities [ 52,53 ] and therefore it is desirable to invoke other possibilities in this braneworld setup .",
    "an amazing feature of the dgp setup is that the normal branch of this scenario , which is not self - accelerating , has the capability to realize phantom - like behavior without introducing any phantom field neither in the bulk nor on the brane [ 54 - 60 ] . by the phantom - like behavior one",
    "means an effective energy density which is positive , grows with time and its equation of state parameter ( @xmath1 ) stays always less than @xmath2 .",
    "the phantom - like prescription breaks down if this effective energy density becomes negative .",
    "an interesting extension of the dgp setup is possible modification of the induced gravity term on the brane the _ modified induced gravity _ since this braneworld scenario is an extension of the dgp model . in the dgp model",
    "the gravity is induced on the brane through interaction of the bulk graviton with loops of matter on the brane .",
    "so , the phrase `` induced gravity '' is coming from the dgp character of our model . ] on the brane .",
    "this can be achieved by treating the induced gravity in the framework of @xmath0-gravity [ 61 - 66 ] .",
    "this extension can be considered as a manifestation of the scalar - tensor gravity on the brane since @xmath0 gravity can be reconstructed as general relativity plus a scalar field [ 32 - 45 ] .",
    "some features of this extension such as self - acceleration in the normal branch of the scenario are studied recently [ 61 - 68 ] . here",
    "we generalize this viewpoint to the case that the gauss - bonnet curvature effect is also taken into account .",
    "we consider a dgp - inspired braneworld model that the induced gravity on the brane is modified in the spirit of @xmath0-gravity and the bulk action contains the gauss - bonnet term to incorporate higher order curvature effects .",
    "our motivation is to study possible influences of the curvature corrections on the cosmological dynamics on the normal branch of the dgp setup .",
    "we analyze the background cosmology and possible realization of the phantom - like behavior in this setup . by introducing a _ curvature fluid _ that plays the role of dark energy component ,",
    "we show that this model realizes phantom - like behavior on the normal branch of the scenario in some subspaces of the model parameter space , without appealing to phantom fields neither in the bulk nor on the brane and by respecting the null energy condition in the phantom - like phase of expansion .",
    "we show also that in this setup there is smooth crossing of the phantom divide line by the equation of state parameter and the universe transits smoothly from quintessence - like phase to a phantom - like phase .",
    "we present a detailed analysis of cosmological dynamics in this setup within a dynamical system approach in order to reveal some yet unknown features of this kinds of models in their phase space",
    ". finally confrontation of our model with recent observational data leads us to some constraint on model parameters .",
    "the action of a gbig ( the gauss - bonnet term in the bulk and induced gravity on the brane ) braneworld scenario can be written as follows [ 69 - 80 ] @xmath3 where by definition @xmath4,\\ ] ] with @xmath5 and @xmath6.\\ ] ] @xmath7 is the 5d newton s constant in the bulk and @xmath8 is the corresponding 4d quantity on the brane .",
    "@xmath9 is the gauss - bonnet term , and @xmath10 is a constant with dimension of @xmath11^{2}$ ] .",
    "@xmath12 is the induced metric on the brane .",
    "we choose the coordinate of the extra dimension to be @xmath13 , so that the brane is located at @xmath14 .",
    "the dgp crossover distance which is defined as @xmath15 has the dimension of @xmath11 $ ] and will be appeared in our forthcoming equations .",
    "we note that this scenario is uv / ir complete in some sense , since it contains both the gauss - bonnet term as a string - inspired modification of the uv ( ultra - violet ) sector and the induced gravity as ir ( infra - red ) modification to the general relativity .",
    "the cosmological dynamics of this gbig scenario is described fully by the following friedmann equation [ 81 - 84 ] @xmath16^{2}= \\frac{4}{r_{c}^{2}}{\\bigg[1+\\frac{8\\alpha}{3}\\big(h^{2}+\\frac{k}{a^{2}}+\\frac{u}{2}\\big)\\bigg]}^{2 } \\big(h^{2}+\\frac{k}{a^{2}}-u\\big)\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 @xmath18 is referred hypothetically as the mass of the bulk black hole and the corresponding term is called the bulk radiation term .",
    "note that when one adopts the positive sign , the above equation can be reduced to the generalized dgp model as @xmath19 , but the branch with negative sign can not be reduced to the generalized dgp model in this regime .",
    "therefore , we just consider the plus sign of the above equation [ 81 - 84 ] .",
    "we note that depending on the choice of the bulk space , the brane frw equations are different ( see [ 85 ] for details ) .",
    "the bulk space in the present model is a 5-dimensional ads black hole .",
    "in which follows , we assume that there is no cosmological constant on the brane and also in the bulk , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath20 .",
    "also we ignore the bulk radiation term since its decay very fast in the early stages of the evolution ( note however that this term is important when one treats cosmological perturbations on the brane ) .",
    "so , the friedmann equation in this case reduces to the following form @xmath21^{2}=\\frac{4}{r_{c}^{2}}{\\bigg[1+\\frac{8\\alpha}{3}h^{2}\\bigg]}^{2 } h^{2}.\\ ] ] it has been shown that it is possible to realize the phantom - like behavior in this setup without introducing any phantom matter on the brane [ 86 - 91 ] . in which follows we generalize this setup to the case that induced gravity on the brane is modified in the spirit of @xmath0 gravity and we explore the cosmological dynamics of this extended braneworld scenario .      in this subsection",
    "we firstly formulate a gbig scenario that induced gravity on the brane acquires a modification in the spirit of @xmath0 gravity . to obtain the generalized friedmann equation of this model we proceed as follows : firstly , the friedmann equation for pure dgp scenario is as follows [ 49 - 51,92,93 ] @xmath22\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is corresponding to two possible embeddings of the brane in the bulk . considering a minkowski bulk with @xmath24 and by setting @xmath25 with a tensionless brane ( @xmath26 ) , for a flat brane @xmath27 we find @xmath28 the normal branch of the scenario is corresponding to the minus sign in the right hand side of this equation .",
    "the second term in the right is the source of the phantom - like behavior on the normal branch : the key feature of this phase is that the brane is extrinsically curved in such a way that shortcuts through the bulk allow gravity to screen the effects of the brane energy - momentum contents at hubble parameters @xmath29 and this is not the case for the self - accelerating phase [ 54 - 60 ] .    in the next step ,",
    "we incorporate possible modification of the induced gravity by inclusion of a @xmath0 term on the brane .",
    "this extension can be considered as a manifestation of the scalar - tensor gravity on the brane . in this case",
    "we find the following generalized friedmann equation ( see for instance [ 61 - 68,92,93 ] )    @xmath30 @xmath31 - 3h\\dot{r}f''(r)\\big)\\big]\\bigg]\\,,\\ ] ] where a prime marks derivative with respect to @xmath32 . in the third step , we need to the gbig friedmann equation in the absence of any modification of the induced gravity on the brane , that is , without @xmath0 term on the brane .",
    "this has been obtained in the previous subsection , equation ( 6 ) .",
    "now we have all prerequisite to obtain the friedmann equation of our gbig - modified gravity scenario .",
    "the comparison between previous equations gives this friedmann equation of cosmological dynamics as follows . ]",
    "@xmath33 where we have defined hypothetically the following energy density corresponding to curvature effect @xmath34 - 3h\\dot{r}f''(r)\\big).\\ ] ] note that to obtain this relation , @xmath18 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are set equal to zero . from now on we restrict our attention to the normal branch of the scenario , _",
    "i.e. _ the minus sign in equation ( 12 ) because there is no ghost instabilities in this branch if only the dgp character of the model is considered .",
    "note however that although we refer to the normal ( ghost - free ) branch of the dgp model ( in the sense that for @xmath38 the obtained solutions reduce to this branch ) as an indication of the ghost - free property of the considered solutions , it is not a - priori guaranteed that on the obtained ds backgrounds which generalize the normal dgp branch , the ghost does not reappear .",
    "in fact , the ghost on the self - accelerated branch of the dgp model is entirely the problem of the de sitter background . within the crossover scale @xmath39 which is the horizon for the self - accelerated branch , the theory reduces to a scalar - tensor model , with the scalar sector ( brane bending mode ) described by a simple galileon self - interaction [ 94 ] as @xmath40 which , in spite of the presence of higher derivatives , propagates a single healthy degree of freedom .",
    "the ghost on the self - accelerated branch arises merely due to the fact that @xmath41 gets a nontrivial profile and the kinetic term for its perturbation flips the sign on the background .",
    "a similar argument can be applied in the present work to overcome the ghost instabilities in this extended braneworld setup .",
    "in which follows , we assume that the energy density @xmath42 on the brane is due to cold dark matter ( cdm ) with @xmath43 . we can rewrite the friedmann equation in terms of observational parameters such as the redshift @xmath44 and dimensionless energy densities @xmath45 as follows @xmath46e(z)\\ ] ] where@xmath47 @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 , the hypothetical pressure of the curvature effect , can be obtained by the following equation of continuity @xmath51^{2}}\\bigg)=\\frac{3h_{0}^{2}\\omega_{m}\\dot{r}f''(r)}{[f'(r)]^{2 } } a^{-3}.\\ ] ] one can obtain a constraint on the cosmological parameters of the model at @xmath52 as follows @xmath53 note that we have used the normalization @xmath54 in this relation which is observationally a viable assumption .",
    "now we study cosmological dynamics in this setup . to solve the friedmann equation for the normal branch of this scenario , it is convenient ( following the papers by bohamdi - lopez in ref . [ 86 - 90 ] ) to introduce the dimensionless variables as follows @xmath55 @xmath56 ^ 3}\\big(\\rho_{m}+ f'(r ) \\rho_{curv}\\big ) = 4\\omega_{\\alpha}^2\\omega_{r}\\big[\\omega_{m}(1+z)^3+\\omega_{curv}(1+z)^{3(1+\\omega_{curv})}\\big]\\ ] ] @xmath57 ^ 2}=4\\omega_{\\alpha}\\omega_{r}.\\ ] ] an effective crossover distance which is appeared on the right hand side of these relations can be defined as follows @xmath58 and by definition @xmath59 .",
    "then the friedmann equation can be rewritten as @xmath60 the number of real roots of this equation is determined by the sign of the discriminant function @xmath61 defined as @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are defined as @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath61 as @xmath67 where @xmath68\\big\\}\\ ] ] @xmath69\\big\\}.\\ ] ] in which follows , we consider just the real and positive roots of the friedmann equation ( 21 ) . for @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "then , the number of real roots of the cubic friedmann equation depends on the minimum energy density of the brane and the situation of @xmath73 relative to this minimum . since in our setup",
    ", curvature effect plays the role of the dark energy component on the brane , we can consider two different regimes to determine the minimum value of @xmath74 as follows : + 1 .",
    "+ in this case , curvature fluid plays the role of quintessence component , then the minimum value happens asymptotically at @xmath75 and we will obtain @xmath76 .",
    "in this situation we can define three possible regimes : a high energy regime with @xmath77 ; a limiting regime with @xmath78 and a low energy regime with @xmath79 . in each of these cases , depending on the sign of @xmath80 there are different solutions [ 86 - 91 ] .",
    "+ in this case , the curvature fluid plays the role of a phantom component ( we will investigate its phantom - like behavior in the next section ) and the minimum value of @xmath74 happens at @xmath81 .",
    "so we find the @xmath82 as follows @xmath83\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath84 .",
    "we note that @xmath85 is not constant and as we will show , it evolves from quintessence to phantom phase .",

    "the relation ( 29 ) is fulfilled for upper region ( region ii ) of this figure . in this case",
    "there are three possible regimes as was mentioned above .",
    "a point that should be emphasized here is the fact that in the presence of modified induced gravity on the brane , the solution of the generalized friedmann equation ( 12 ) is actually rather involved due to simultaneously presence of @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "a through analysis of this problem is out of the scope of this study , but there are some attempts ( such as cosmography ) in this direction to construct an operational framework to treat this problem , see for instance [ 95 ] . here",
    "we have tried to find a solution of equation ( 12 ) by using the discriminant function @xmath61 , the result of which is given by ( 27 ) .",
    "however , we note that a complete analysis is needed for instance in the framework of cosmography of brane @xmath0 gravity [ 96 ] .    to investigate cosmology described by solution ( 27 ) , we rewrite the original friedmann equation in the following form in order to create a general relativistic description of our model @xmath96 that @xmath97 is defined in ( 13 ) .",
