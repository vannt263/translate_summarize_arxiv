    "the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) constructed in @xcite offers a systematic description of processes involving energetic particles .",

    "hard exclusive and inclusive processes in qcd are usually described using the powerful techniques of qcd factorization and light - cone expansions  @xcite .",
    "scet encompasses and extends these frameworks , and in particular allows a model independent description of effects caused by the interplay between energetic collinear particles and soft particles beyond leading order in the power expansion .",
    "these effects can be described in a rigorous way based solely on qcd , but are not included in purely collinear expansions .",
    "the study of operators that describe these mixed collinear - ultrasoft ( collinear - usoft ) effects is the purpose of this paper . for recent applications of scet in hard scattering processes and b - decays",
    "see refs .",
    "@xcite .    since our focus is on mixed collinear - usoft interactions , we consider collinear quark fields @xmath13 , collinear gluon fields @xmath14 , usoft heavy quark fields @xmath15 , usoft light quark fields @xmath16 , and usoft gluons @xmath17 .",

    "this is in contrast with collinear - soft couplings whose interactions are mediated by offshell fluctuations  @xcite , and appear in external operators .",
    "we comment on collinear - soft interactions at the end of the paper .",
    "the derivation of the leading order collinear quark and gluon lagrangians @xmath19 and @xmath20 can be found in ref .",

    "@xcite the rpi of scet was extended to the most general three classes ( i , ii , iii ) , and the multipole expansion of the collinear quark lagrangian was treated to higher orders in @xmath23 and were shown not to receive anomalous dimensions . in ref .",
    "@xcite the presence of additional @xmath1 heavy - to - light currents was pointed out that were missing in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the study of power corrections in scet was continued in ref .",
    "@xcite and several important results were obtained for mixed usoft - collinear operators .",
    "in particular the mixed usoft - collinear quark lagrangian @xmath24 was first considered and was derived to @xmath25 working at tree level , but to all orders in attachments of @xmath26 gluon fields . in a similar fashion heavy - to - light currents were derived to @xmath0 , and linear combinations of currents that are invariant under the three types of rpi were identified .",
    "it was also shown that the operators in @xmath24 are not renormalized based on an analysis of arbitrary @xmath27-loop diagrams in the hard region of qcd .",
    "the mixed usoft - collinear quark lagrangian @xmath24 was extended to a gauge invariant form with covariant derivatives in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to answer some open questions regarding our knowledge of the power suppressed usoft - collinear lagrangian and heavy - to - light currents .",
    "this includes the number of @xmath21 currents at @xmath1 , since even at tree level the full reduction of dirac structures has not yet been implemented . for both @xmath21 and @xmath24 we also construct a complete basis which is valid for matching at any order in @xmath2 , and therefore includes all operators that can be induced by radiative corrections or operator mixing .",
    "we work in the most general possible frame throughout ( eg .  allowing @xmath28 ,",
    "@xmath29 ) , and consider all the restrictions from rpi including the transformation of wilson coefficients .",
    "finally , we include the mixed usoft - collinear pure glue lagrangian beyond lo ( which follows from an extension of work in refs .",
    "the above results are obtained by considering the full implications of rpi , and including all possible operators allowed from collinear gauge invariance , power counting , and the reduction of dirac structures from the effective theory fields .",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath1 which is one order less than the order to which the tree - level matching results are known from ref .",
    "we treat @xmath24 to @xmath0 , and give a detailed account of how the gauge invariant form in ref .",

    "@xcite the attention was restricted to scet operators of two - body type @xmath31 , where the two products in parenthesis are collinear gauge invariant , and the ellipses denote combinations of collinear derivatives . beyond tree level but at the same order in @xmath23 , we find that three - body structures can appear for some of the currents , having the form @xmath32 with three collinear gauge invariant factors .",
    "we show the rpi can be used to determine for which currents this happens .",
    "we also show that rpi greatly restricts the form of the three - body operators , so that they always involve a collinear gluon field strength .",
    "the two - body operators have hard wilson coefficients which are functions of a single parameter @xmath33 , while the new three - body operators have two parameter coefficients @xmath34 .",
    "analogous three - body structures could appear in the usoft - collinear lagrangian @xmath24 at higher orders in perturbation theory , however using constraints from symmetries of scet we prove that this does not occur .",
    "our results are relevant to the study of decay channels for @xmath35 mesons which involve energetic hadrons in the final state .",

    "however , as we show in section  [ bpisection ] it is possible to absorb the @xmath60 terms into a redefinition of the @xmath61 to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the factorization formula provides a clean separation of the `` soft '' non - factorizable ( nf ) contributions and `` hard '' factorizable ( f ) terms without double counting .",
    "it also gives us a procedure to systematically improve the predictions to any order in perturbation theory at leading order in @xmath30 .",
    "the value of @xmath48 and @xmath47 can depend on which heavy - to - light process we consider , whereas @xmath45 and @xmath62 are universal functions .",

    "the @xmath70 terms satisfy the so - called large energy form factor relations  @xcite , as expected from the prior loose definitions of these terms as `` soft '' contributions  @xcite .",
    "note that we have not bothered to separate @xmath71 and @xmath72 fluctuations in the @xmath61 functions , since it is not clearly beneficial phenomenologically .",
    "the factorization theorem does tell us that @xmath73 , however it does not distinguish between factors of @xmath74 and @xmath75 in this @xmath76 .",
    "it also does not numerically favor the @xmath57 or @xmath70 term , for instance it is possible that the leading @xmath53 in @xmath51 is compensated by an analogous factor in @xmath61 .",
