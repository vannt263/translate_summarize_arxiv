    "the transverse spin structure of the nucleon is a hot issue in spin physics .",
    "single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) through semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ( sidis ) process with a transversely polarized target provides us with a plausible way to explore the internal structure of the nucleon . in such process",
    "a number of form factors with different azimuthal angle dependence are measurable .",
    "these form factors can be interpreted as the convolution of the parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions . according to the transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) factorization  @xcite , which is intuitively a natural generalization of the collinear case by taking into account the transverse momentum ,",
    "eight tmd distribution functions are needed to describe the spin structure of the nucleon at the leading twist . among the eight , some of them relating to the transverse spin effect",
    "have attracted many interests in recent years , such as the sivers , transversity and newly pretzelosity functions , which can manifest themselves through the @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 asymmetries , respectively in the sidis process .",
    "the hermes collaboration has already published their data on the proton target  @xcite with non - vanishing @xmath3 and @xmath1 asymmetries .",
    "some unexpected phenomena were also observed , for example , the @xmath1 asymmetry for @xmath4 production is larger than that for @xmath5 production .",
    "a possible explantation for this is that the corresponding unfavored fragmentation function is comparable with or even larger than the favored one  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the so called collins function  @xcite .",
    "this relation is now widely adopted in parametrizations , but is still a puzzling theoretical problem .",
    "the compass collaboration  @xcite has also made the measurement with the deuteron target , which can be viewed as a combination of a proton and a neutron , and observed nearly zero asymmetries for both @xmath3 and @xmath1 asymmetries .",
    "this could be accounted for as the cancelation between the @xmath8 and @xmath9 quarks .",
    "so a direct measurement with the neutron target is ideal to address this issue .",
    "however , there is no free neutron target for the experiment , so usually the @xmath0he target is used as a substitution .",
    "@xmath0he is a spin half nucleus , composed by two protons and one neutron , with the polarizations of the two protons anti - paralleled , thus @xmath0he can be viewed as a nearly free neutron .",
    "jefferson lab ( jlab ) is performing the measurement with a @xmath0he target under 6 gev , and will upgrade their plan by a 12 gev beam energy in the near future  @xcite .",
    "such plan can be considered as performing a measurement for the purpose to focus attention on the neutron target .    however , after taking into account other effects , @xmath0he can not be viewed as a pure neutron strictly . how to connect the experiment result of the @xmath0he target with the free neutron case needs to be carefully considered .",
    "some theoretical work  @xcite already investigated the problem , and the following relation is often used , @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the effective nucleon polarizations , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 as suggested in ref .",
    "@xmath14 are the dilution factors with the definitions @xmath15 we have simply generalized the expression above into the tmd case , and the integrals in the numerator and denominator are performed over all the phase space independently .",
    "the validity of eq .",
    "( [ a1_he ] ) was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite , we already used this formula to predict the @xmath0he asymmetry , but with a constant value estimation for the dilution factors , adopted @xmath16 and @xmath17 around @xmath18 as proposed  @xcite .",
    "now we have re - examined our calculation , and find that this rough estimation is not adequate to give the proper prediction . in this brief note , we deal with the problem in an improved treatment with the dilution factors varying with kinematic variables , meanwhile we update our prediction from the following aspects :    * we present predictions not only for jlab 12 gev , but also for jlab 6 gev to confront with the data that will come soon . *",
    "we calculate under the tmd framework , and show the asymmetries depending on @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . *",
    "we multiply only the azimuthal angle dependence as the weighting function to extract the corresponding asymmetry , rather than multiply an extra momentum dependent factor as we did in our previous paper .",
    "the former treatment is often used in many experiments , while the latter one is not so widely adopted , although it can avoid the tangle of the quark internal momenta from a theoretical viewpoint . *",
    "we also give the asymmetry related to pretzelosity , another chiral - odd but t - even tmd distribution , which also couples with the collins functions in the sidis process .",
    "in the next calculation , the tmd distributions will be derived from an su(6 ) quark - diquark model as we used in our previous papers  @xcite , with the collins function and the unpolarized fragmentation function parametrized from anselmino _ et al . _",
    "@xcite and kretzer _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the kinematics for the 6 and 12 gev are in table [ kin ] .",
    ".kinematics [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     first , we will present our numerical results on the dilution factors under 6 and 12 gev kinematics in fig .",
    "[ dilution6 ] and fig .",
    "[ dilution12 ] , respectively .    ,",
    "but for the 12 gev kinematics .",
    "]    , but for the 12 gev kinematics .",
    "]    from the two figures , we find that the dilution factors vary very little with @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but vary significantly with @xmath19 , especially for the @xmath5 production . in our previous calculation",
    "@xcite , we used the estimation @xmath16 and @xmath17 as proposed  @xcite .",
    "we are mainly interested in the @xmath19 dependence , and could make a comparison with our results . for the @xmath4 production , our results are very close with that in the proposal  @xcite . however , for the @xmath5 production , we give a much smaller dilution factor for neutron and a larger one for proton , especially when @xmath19 increases .",
    "this can be easily understood that for the @xmath5 production , @xmath30 is favored and @xmath31 is unfavored .",
    "since the @xmath32 target can be viewed as a nearly free neutron target , we expect that our updated results of the asymmetries for the @xmath5 production might be suppressed due to this new treatment with the dilution factors .",
    "[ 6gev ] and fig .",

    "this can be accounted for by the suppression of the dilution factors .",
    "we deal with the dilution factors in two approaches , one is to use the constant value estimation , i.e. @xmath17 and @xmath16 as was supposed to hold around @xmath18  @xcite and used in our previous calculation  @xcite , and the other is to calculate from the definition in eq .",
    "( [ dilution ] ) , where the dilution factors vary with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we find that the results of the two approaches are very close to each other for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 dependence .",
    "however , it has some difference for the @xmath19 dependence . as we expected , the asymmetry for the @xmath4 production in both approaches are also very close to each other .",
    "but for the @xmath5 production , the asymmetry in the latter approach is indeed smaller than that in the former approach according to our analysis in the above .",
    "such small results might be achieved in jlab with a high precision measurement , so we should be careful about this effect caused by the dilution factors . also we plot the @xmath2 asymmetry in the lower panels in fig .",
    "[ 6gev ] and fig .",
    "[ 12gev ] .",
    "this asymmetry is indeed much smaller than the @xmath1 asymmetry as we expected in our previous calculation  @xcite .",
    "this implies that it might be more difficult to measure the @xmath2 asymmetry related to the pretzelosity , unless a high precision can be achieved .",
    "it is suggested  @xcite that the asymmetry can be amplified by introducing a transverse momentum cut in data analysis .",
    "eq .  ( [ a1_he ] ) was supposed as a useful formula to extract the neutron information in the experiment . using mean values for the dilution factors in the calculation",
    ", we find that such treatment might be approximately valid for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 dependence , and even for the @xmath19 dependence in the @xmath4 production , but can not be applied for the @xmath19 dependence in the @xmath5 production . in this note , we performed the calculation starting from the definition ( [ dilution ] ) , which is demonstrated to be equivalent to the relation  ( [ pdf_he ] ) , and find that this approach may cause smaller results of asymmetries than our previous calculation  @xcite for the @xmath5 production process .",
    "so we suggest that in extracting the neutron information , it is not adequate to use the mean values for the dilution factors .",
    "unreliable treatment of dilution factors may bring unreliable information of the neutron quantities extracted from @xmath0he data .",
    "therefore it is important to find reliable treatment of dilution factors in extracting the neutron asymmetries from @xmath0he experiments .",
    "due to the suppression from the dilution factors , all the @xmath0he asymmetries are predicted to be very small , so high precision measurements are demanded .",
