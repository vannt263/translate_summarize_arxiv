    "<S> we study the production of the spin partner of the @xmath0 , which is a @xmath1 bound state with quantum numbers @xmath2 and named @xmath3 here , with the associated emission of a photon in electron  positron collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that the ideal energy region to observe the @xmath4 in @xmath5 annihilations is from 4.4  gev to 4.5  gev , due to the presence of the @xmath6-wave @xmath7 and @xmath8 thresholds , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that it will be difficult to observe the @xmath9 at the @xmath5 center - of - mass energy around 4.26  gev .    in the heavy quarkonium mass region , the so called @xmath10 states </S>",
    "<S> have been observed , and many of these quarkonium - like states defy a conventional quark model interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> they are therefore suggested to be exotic . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 , discovered by the belle collaboration  @xcite , is the one of the most interesting exotic states . </S>",
    "<S> as the mass of the @xmath0 is extremely close to the @xmath11 threshold , it is regarded as one especially promising candidate for a hadronic molecule .    </S>",
    "<S> effective field theory ( eft ) can cope with the interaction between heavy mesons in bound state systems at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> for such a kind of systems , heavy quark symmetry is relevant due to the presence of the heavy quark / antiquark in the meson / antimeson . </S>",
    "<S> this fact leads to predictions of new states as partners of the observed @xmath10 states in the hadron spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> for example , with an eft description of the heavy mesonic molecules , the heavy quark symmetry can be used to predict the existence of the spin and bottom partners of the @xmath0  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the spin partner of the @xmath0 , called @xmath4 hereafter , is predicted to exist as the @xmath6-wave bound state of @xmath1 with quantum numbers @xmath12  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a state was also expected to exist in other models , see refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is different from the @xmath0 in several aspects : first , being an isoscalar state it should decay into the @xmath13 with a branching fraction much larger than that for the @xmath14 because the @xmath15 and @xmath16 thresholds are far below the mass of the @xmath4 ( very different to the case of the @xmath0 ) ; second , it is expected to decay dominantly into open charm mesons , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in a @xmath20-wave with a width of the order of a few mev  @xcite ; third , its mass as set by the @xmath21 threshold is higher than the quark model prediction for the first radially excited @xmath22  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the significance of the @xmath3 state is that its mass should be approximately given by the @xmath23 as dictated by heavy quark spin symmetry for heavy - flavor hadronic molecules  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notice that a state with the same quantum numbers @xmath12 was also predicted in the tetraquark model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fine splitting between the @xmath12 and @xmath24 tetraquarks , which was predicted to be 70  mev in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is not locked to that between the @xmath25 and @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the splitting between the @xmath26 @xmath27 states in the godfrey  </S>",
    "<S> isgur quark model is 30  mev  @xcite , also much smaller than @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if a @xmath12 state will be observed in experiments with a mass around 4012  mev , the mass by itself would already be a strong support for the hadronic molecular nature of both the @xmath0 and the tensor state . as a result , searching for a @xmath12 state with a mass around 4012  mev is very important even for understanding the nature of the @xmath0 .    however , although the @xmath0 has been observed by many other experiments after its discovery  @xcite , no evidence for the existence of its spin partner has been reported . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it is shown that the prompt production of the @xmath4 presents a significant discovery potential at hadron colliders . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will investigate the production of the @xmath4 associated with the photon radiation in electron  positron collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this work presents an extension of the study on the production of the @xmath0 as a @xmath29 molecule in charmonia radiative transitions reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . in that paper </S>",
    "<S> , it was shown that the favorite energy regions for the @xmath30 production are around the @xmath31 mass and 4.45  gev . </S>",
    "<S> later on , the besiii collaboration observed events for the process @xmath32  @xcite , which may be regarded as a support of the dominantly molecular nature of the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> since the existence of the @xmath21 bound state , the @xmath4 , is the consequence of the heavy quark spin symmetry of the molecular nature of the @xmath0 , the production of the @xmath4 in @xmath5 collisions in the energy range of the besiii experiment  @xcite thus provides an opportunity to search for new charmonium - like states on the one hand and can offer useful information towards understanding the @xmath0 on the other hand .    </S>",
    "<S> the production of the @xmath0 through the radiative decay of the @xmath33 charmonium is considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory along with the x - eft  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite studied the @xmath0 production by considering the contribution from intermediate charmed meson loops , and it was argued that the dominant mechanism is as follows : the initial charmonium is coupled to a pair of charmed mesons with one being @xmath6-wave with @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the total angular momentum of the light - flavor cloud in the charmed meson , and the other being @xmath36-wave with @xmath37 , and the @xmath36-wave charmed meson radiatively transits to a @xmath38 which coalesce with the other @xmath6-wave charmed meson , @xmath39 , into the @xmath0 . the spin partner of @xmath0 , the @xmath4 , can be produced by a similar mechanism as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feynmandiagram ] .     in vector charmonia </S>",
    "<S> radiative decays . </S>",
    "<S> the charge - conjugated diagrams are not shown here . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    notice that the @xmath4 couples to @xmath40 instead of @xmath41 , as it is in the case of the @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we will only consider the neutral charmed mesons in the loops because the photonic coupling between the @xmath36-wave and @xmath6-wave charmed mesons for the neutral ones is much larger than that for the charged . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to cancellation of contributions from the charm and down quarks in the charged mesons , see , e.g.  @xcite . in the loops , the @xmath4 couples to the @xmath42 pair in an @xmath6-wave . with the quantum numbers being @xmath43 , the initial charmonium can couple to one @xmath36-wave and one @xmath6-wave charmed meson in either @xmath6- or @xmath20-wave . </S>",
    "<S> since both the initial charmonium and the @xmath4 in the final state are close to the corresponding thresholds of the charmed - meson pairs , we are able to use a power counting in velocity of the intermediate mesons . following the power counting rules as detailed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and presented in the case of interest in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the dominant contribution comes from the case when the coupling of the initial charmonium to the charmed mesons is in an @xmath6-wave . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the initial charmonium should be a @xmath20-wave state in the heavy quark limit @xmath44 as a consequence of heavy quark spin symmetry  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the charmed mesons can be classified according to the total angular momentum of the light degrees of freedom @xmath35 and collected in doublets with total spin @xmath45 in the heavy quark limit . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath46 states correspond to charmed mesons in the doublet @xmath47 , here denoted as @xmath48 , whereas the @xmath49 states correspond to charmed mesons in the doublet @xmath50 , denoted as @xmath51 . to describe these heavy mesons </S>",
    "<S> , we choose the two - component notation introduced in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the notation uses @xmath52 matrix fields , and is convenient for nonrelativistic calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the fields for the relevant heavy meson states are @xmath53 for the @xmath46 ( @xmath6-wave ) and @xmath54 ( @xmath36-wave ) heavy mesons , respectively , where @xmath55 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath56 is the flavor index for the light quarks . in eq .  , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 and @xmath58 annihilate the pseudoscalar and vector heavy mesons , respectively , and @xmath59 and @xmath60 annihilate the excited axial - vector and tensor heavy mesons , respectively . under the same phase convention for charge conjugation specified in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the fields annihilating the mesons containing an anticharm quark are  @xcite @xmath61 in nonrelativistic limit , the field for the @xmath20-wave @xmath43 charmonium state can be written as  @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 annihilates the @xmath20-wave vector charmonium , and the spin-0 and spin-2 states irrelevant for our study are not shown . in order to calculate the triangle diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : feynmandiagram ] , we need the lagrangian for coupling the @xmath20-wave charmonia to the @xmath64-@xmath65 charmed - meson pair as well as that for the e1 radiative transitions between the charmed mesons  @xcite @xmath66 + \\sum_a \\frac{c_a}{2}\\ , { \\textrm{tr}}\\left [ t_a^i h_a^\\dag \\right ] e^i + \\text{h.c.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the first term the einstein summation convention is used while for the latter we distinguish the coupling constants for different light flavors because there is no isospin symmetry in the electromagnetic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , </S>",
    "<S> we parametrize the coupling of the @xmath4 to the pair of vector charm and anticharm mesons as @xmath67    with the above preparations , we can now proceed to calculate quantitatively the production of the @xmath68 in electron  positron collisions . </S>",
    "<S> although in the heavy quark limit the production of the @xmath20-wave vector heavy quarkonium or the pair of @xmath64 and @xmath65 heavy mesons are suppressed due to spin symmetry  @xcite , we can expect a large spin symmetry breaking in the charmonium mass region above 4  gev . </S>",
    "<S> this may be seen from similar values of electronic widths of the excited vector charmonia . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we will assume that the production of the @xmath68 occurs through the @xmath20-wave charmonia or the @xmath20-wave components of excited vector charmonia . </S>",
    "<S> without any detailed information about the values of the coupling constants , we can predict the energy regions with the maximal production cross sections .    </S>",
    "<S> -wave charmonium into @xmath69 on the mass of the charmonium . </S>",
    "<S> the solid and dotted curves are obtained with and without taking into account the widths of the @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath72 is used.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : psidxga ] , we show the dependence of the decay width of a @xmath20-wave charmonium into the @xmath68 , divided by @xmath73 , on the mass of the @xmath20-wave charmonium or the center - of - mass energy of the @xmath5 collisions . the value of the photonic coupling @xmath74 does not affect the shape of the dependence either . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we took @xmath72 which is a typical value evaluated from various quark model predictions for the decay widths @xmath75  @xcite . in the figure </S>",
    "<S> , the dashed curve is obtained neglecting the widths of the @xmath76 and @xmath77 states , and the solid curve is the result of evaluating the triangle loop integrals with constant widths for the @xmath76 and @xmath77 as done in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum around 4.447  gev and the local minimum around 4.492  gev of the dashed curve are due to the presence of landau singularities  @xcite of triangle diagrams in the complex plane at @xmath78  gev ( for the @xmath76 loop ) and @xmath79  gev ( for the @xmath77 loop ) , respectively ( for a discussion of the landau singularities in the triangle diagrams of heavy quarkonium transitions , we refer to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two cusps on both sides of the shoulders of the peak show up at the thresholds of the @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    from the figure , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the ideal energy regions for producing the @xmath68 in @xmath5 collisions are around the @xmath80 and @xmath81 thresholds , i.e. between 4.4  gev and 4.5  gev . </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear that the mass region of the @xmath82 is not good for the production of the @xmath68 , contrary to the case of the @xmath83 . in order to quantify the relative production rate of the @xmath68 with respect to the @xmath83 </S>",
    "<S> , we require the @xmath82 to couple to the @xmath64-@xmath65 meson pair as follows @xmath84 where we have assumed isospin symmetry in the couplings and the flavor index @xmath56 runs over up and down quarks . </S>",
    "<S> notice that if the @xmath82 is a pure @xmath85 ( here and in the following the charge conjugated channels are dropped for simplicity ) molecule  @xcite , it would not couple to the @xmath80 and @xmath81 as given by the @xmath86 and @xmath87 terms , and thus can not decay into the @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> these two terms are included to allow the decay to occur . to have @xmath80 and @xmath81 components </S>",
    "<S> was discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . ] </S>",
    "<S> because the @xmath4 is the spin partner of the @xmath0 , for a rough estimate , we can assume that @xmath88 takes the same value as the coupling constant of the @xmath0 to the @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> we also assume that the values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 are related to @xmath92 by a spin symmetry relation for @xmath20-wave charmoinia . comparing eq .   with eq .   </S>",
    "<S> one obtains @xmath93 and @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the ratio of the partial decay widths of the @xmath82 to the @xmath68 and the @xmath83 can be estimated parameter - free , and is @xmath95 in the above ratio , whether or not to take into account the finite widths of the @xmath36-wave charmed mesons only results in a minor change of 2% . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that unless the @xmath82 couples to the @xmath80 and/or @xmath81 with a coupling much larger than that for the @xmath85 , which is less possible , the branching fraction of the @xmath96 is much smaller than that of the @xmath97 . given that the number of events for the latter process as observed at besiii is the order of 10  @xcite , it is unlikely to make an observation of the @xmath68 at an energy 4.26  gev at besiii .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , it is generally expected that the @xmath0 as a hadronic molecule has a spin partner close to the @xmath21 threshold . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the production of the @xmath68 in @xmath5 collisions . according to our calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we strongly suggest to search for the @xmath4 associated with a photon in the energy region between 4.4  gev and 4.5  gev in @xmath5 collisions . besides , the width ratio of the @xmath82 decaying to @xmath69 and @xmath98 is quite small , at the order of @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> thus observing the @xmath68 at an energy around 4.26  gev would be unlikely in the besiii experiment according to the current result of @xmath100 . </S>"
