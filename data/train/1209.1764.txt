    "transmembrane voltage is often recorded during physiological study of biological neurons . however , voltage - gated ion channel activity and neurotransmitter levels are quite difficult to measure directly and are usually unobserved in such studies . in addition , there is a great diversity of neuron morphology , protein expression , and plasticity which may affect voltage dynamics and synaptic transmission  @xcite . early development and senescence",
    "may also be major determinants of voltage response profiles  @xcite .",
    "synaptic tuning in particular is thought to be an essential mediator of learning , stimulus response integration , and memory .",
    "there is evidence that memory and learning may depend critically on several distinct types of dynamic behavior in the voltage of neurons .",
    "the ml model reproduces the voltage of a single neuron and , depending on parameterization and initial conditions , can exhibit many of the experimentally observed behaviors of biological neurons  @xcite . in this paper , we explore a simple neural network consisting of two biologically identical , reciprocally coupled ml neurons .  @xcite have shown that this modest model can exhibit a wide range of oscillating or non - oscillating voltage depending on the values of just a few parameters , specifically in this study , @xmath1and @xmath0 . in the absence of noise , the model can predict synchronous or asynchronous firing , as well as either equal or unequal action potential amplitudes .",
    "additionally , in the presence of even small noise in the applied current and weak synaptic coupling , the system can exhibit mixed - mode oscillations ( mmo ) characterized by periods of small amplitude oscillation interrupted by large amplitude excursions .",
    "in further work with the two ml neuron model ,  @xcite explored two synaptically decoupled neurons driven by both common and independent intrinsic noise terms .",
    "they found that shared common noise promotes synchronous firing of the two neurons , while separate intrinsic noise terms promoted asynchronous firing .",
    "the relative scaling of the two noise sources was observed to be key in predicting the degree of synchrony .",
    "in addition , while they did not specifically look at mmo , they hypothesized that such synchrony in a synaptically coupled network would increase the probability of mmo , by facilitating longer residence times within the unstable periodic orbits adjacent to the system s stable periodic orbits .",
    "indeed , in this paper we will detail the relative positions of these parameter regions as they are of key importance to our conditioned likelihood approach . specifically , we will provide a quick look - up table for the region in parameter space where stable periodic orbits are possible .",
    "@xcite develop a expectation - maximization ( em ) stochastic particle filter method to estimate the parameters in a single ml neuron based on observation of voltage only .",
    "a key aspect of their approach is that they assume both the voltage and the channel gating variables are in an oscillatory regime , but stochastically perturbed . these perturbations are considered nuisance parameters which their method marginalizes away . specifically , they treat the unobserved channel gating variable from the model as a completely latent variable . starting from estimates of the initial conditions for the voltage and channel gating variables , they iteratively predict the gating variable and voltage and",
    "then update the predicted voltage to the next time step using a modification of the well - known euler differential equation solver .",
    "they discuss that an assumption of stationarity in their method limits applicability to only short time windows over which current input can be considered constant ( e.g. 600ms ) .",
    "they also note that certain parameters , conductances and reversal potentials in particular , are sensitive to choice of tuning parameters required by the method .",
    "these studies demonstrate the active progress as well as the challenges of model parameter estimation for biological neuronal models and , more generally , for relaxation oscillator models .",
    "each of these studies derives asymptotic approximations or general forms for model likelihood , but use fundamentally different techniques and assumptions in doing so . in each",
    "study the approach is specifically crafted to the model . in this paper",
    "we attempt to develop a convenient bayesian estimation scheme with only a few tuning parameters and relatively few mild assumptions .",
    "we focus our attention on deterministic synaptically coupled ml neurons .",
    "application of our method to stochastically coupled ml neurons is on - going work in our group .    in the case of ml , estimation of @xmath1and @xmath0is non - trivial due to the diversity of possible dynamic behavior and the abrupt transitions among these seen with just small changes in these parameters values .",
    "however , we can better understand the critical values of these parameters by studying the system s bifurcation structure .",
    "we are able to locate parameter regimes where dramatic changes in the system appear .",
    "the neurons analyzed in this study are classified as type ii neurons , characterized by discontinuous drastic shifting between behavioral states . because there is a distinct switch in behavior , bifurcation analyses determine a closed region of parameter space over which the relevant dynamics may occur .",
    "sampling over such a feasibility region amounts to conditioning the inference on an _ a priori _ assumed class of dynamics ( e.g. stable node , limit cycle , steady state etc . ) . while facilitating conditioning the likelihood on feature statistics of the voltage",
    ", this may translate into increased confidence and reduced bias in the parameter estimates .",
    "our goal is parameter inference based on the temporal voltage response of two synaptically coupled neurons which are deterministically coupled to voltage - gated ionic conductance dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a single ml model has a two - dimensional phase space and is known to reproduce many of the behaviors experimentally observed in biological neurons  @xcite .",
    "therefore , systems of coupled ml neurons may offer a reasonable starting point for developing statistical inference methods for models of neuronal networks .",
    "the ml network we study is , @xmath2 where @xmath3    note that in the stochastic version of this model @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are standard independent wiener process variables . in this paper , however we will be concerned with the deterministic version of this model where @xmath7 .    .",
