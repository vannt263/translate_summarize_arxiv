    "it has become clear quite recently that the qed corrections give a large contribution , of the order of @xmath7 , to the parity nonconservation ( pnc ) amplitude in heavy atoms , which makes them important for an analysis of modern experimental data .",
    "the present paper summarizes recent progress in calculations of the qed radiative corrections to pnc . over the last few years the experimental data of the boulder group for the @xmath6 pnc amplitude in @xmath1cs , which remains the most accurate in the area of atomic pnc ,",
    "were presumed to be able to challenge the standard model .",
    "the radiative corrections eliminate this possibility , their accurate determination brings the atomic experimental data for the mentioned transition in agreement with the standard model .",
    "the paper presents also a brief description of the methods used for calculations of the qed corrections .",
    "some of them , that have been recently designed for applications to the pnc problem , may be of interest in other areas where qed corrections are studied .",
    "several atoms and several transitions have been studied experimentally in relation to pnc .",
    "as was mentioned , the most accurate experimental data was obtained for the pnc @xmath6 pnc transition in @xmath1cs .",
    "studies of this transition initiated by bouchiat and bouchiat @xcite , were continued and developed in paris and in boulder @xcite .",
    "the latest work of wood _ et al _ @xcite reduced the experimental error to @xmath8 that remains the best accuracy in atomic pnc experiments .",
    "these results inspired interest in very accurate atomic pnc calculations that , eventually , led to recognition of the fact that the qed corrections contribute at the necessary level of accuracy . other experiments on pnc have been carried out for several transitions in several atoms .",
    "this includes the @xmath9 transition in @xmath3tl @xcite , and the @xmath10 transition in @xmath3tl @xcite , the @xmath11 transition in @xmath4pb @xcite and two transitions in @xmath5bi , @xmath12 measured in pioneering works of barkov and zolotorev @xcite and in @xcite as well as the @xmath13 transition @xcite .",
    "the comprehensive theoretical background on pnc as well as a detailed account of events which led to a discovery of pnc in atoms ( that was also the first observation of pnc in neutral currents ) can be found in the book of khriplovich @xcite .",
    "errors of final quantities that can be extracted from experimental results on pnc in atoms crucially depend on the accuracy of atomic calculations .",
    "the most difficult and cumbersome part of the theoretical research is the atomic structure calculations that take into account the many - electron nature of the atomic wave function in heavy atoms .",
    "a foundation for the modern theoretical description of many - electron correlations in the pnc problem was laid out in the works @xcite which also give references to previous papers .",
    "the calculations of the many - electron correlations in the @xmath6 transition in @xmath1cs in these works gave very close results , with the error in both sets of calculations estimated as @xmath14 .",
    "the problem was revisited in several recent publications that supported the results of @xcite improving the error .",
    "improvement of the theoretical error was initiated in refs .",
    "@xcite that compared a number of experimentally measured quantities , such as polarizabilities , dipole amplitudes and hyperfine constants , with theoretical predictions of refs .",
    "@xcite , concluding that the theoretical error of these works was probably better than it had been anticipated , at the level of @xmath15 .",
    "this conclusion allowed the authors of @xcite to reveal a deviation that existed between the experimental data of @xcite and the standard model ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the following theoretical works @xcite demonstrated that indeed , the theoretical error that originates from the manyelectron correlations can be reduced down to @xmath17 for the @xmath6 transition in @xmath1cs , thus matching the experimental accuracy of ref .",
    "the net result of the experimental and theoretical progress at this period of time was a pronounced deviation , of the order of @xmath18 , between predictions of the standard model and experimental data that was proved to be not related to uncertainties imposed by the complicated manyelectron nature of the problem .",
    "the progress outlined above indicated that either the standard model needed improvement , or some unrecognized , underestimated factors should come into play .",
    "a careful analysis revealed that there was an overlooked factor well within the framework of the standard model , namely the conventional qed corrections to the pnc amplitude .",
    "obviously , they have always been kept in mind , but for a long period of time they were estimated as negligible in the pnc problem . from the perspective of the present day situation the fact that they play an important role can be considered as a general statement . historically , however , its realization stemmed from several works devoted to different , separate phenomena that contribute to the qed corrections .",
    "derevianko @xcite found that the breit corrections to electron - electron interaction in heavy atoms are much larger than it had been anticipated , giving @xmath19 for the @xmath6 pnc amplitude in @xmath1cs .",
    "this result was obtained numerically , and later confirmed in a number of papers @xcite both numerically and analytically .",
    "the account of the breit corrections put the experimental data of @xcite much closer to the standard model , but this was only the beginning of an intriguing zigzag road of research .",
    "an analysis of the breit corrections by sushkov @xcite revealed that one can expect the qed vacuum polarization to be as important as the breit corrections .",
    "@xcite for the first time proved that indeed , the vacuum polarization is very important . for the @xmath6 pnc amplitude in @xmath1cs atom they found that it gives @xmath15 , as confirmed in @xcite . from a purely pragmatic , numerical point of view",
    "the vacuum polarization mostly compensated for the contribution of the breit corrections , bringing the experimental data for the @xmath1cs atom back in contradiction with the standard model .",
    "the most difficult and , correspondingly , challenging part of the qed corrections to the pnc amplitude is presented by the qed self - energy corrections .",
    "we are using this term here in a sense that embraces the vertex corrections as well .",
    "one could have anticipated these corrections to be large from the very beginning .",
    "the self - energy corrections are known to give a large contribution to a number of phenomena in atomic physics , including the lamb shift , the hyperfine interaction , and the energy shift due to the finite nuclear size ( fns ) .",
    "the latter phenomenon will play a particular role in the following discussion .",
    "there is no physical reason indicating that the pnc amplitude should be any different .",
    "the sign of the self - energy corrections is also predetermined .",
    "the qed self - energy is known to be mostly repulsive ( this is definitely true for the @xmath20 state that should play a very important role ) in contrast to the attractive vacuum polarization . therefore the self - energy corrections should make the electron wave function smaller at the nucleus and , consequently , give a negative contribution to the pnc amplitude .",
    "however , the aforementioned reasons were confronted by counter - arguments indicating that the self - energy corrections should be small .",
    "one reason , briefly mentioned in @xcite , relies on the fact that in the plane - wave approximation the self - energy corrections are small , of the order of @xmath21 for @xmath1cs atom , as was found by marciano and sirlin @xcite and lynn and sandars @xcite .",
    "one can argue that account of the nuclear coulomb field should not produce any dramatic enhancement , and the self - energy corrections should , probably , remain small .",
    "the argument has its merit , it is known to be correct for the case of the vacuum polarization , where higher - order corrections are suppressed , see section [ vacuum and related ] .",
    "however , the self - energy corrections behave differently .",
    "the well - studied case of the hyperfine interaction is an example .",
    "it is known from both analytical and numerical calculations , see refs . @xcite and references therein , that in this problem the manifestations of the coulomb field in the self - energy corrections in heavy atoms are more pronounced than a contribution of the plane - wave approximation ,",
    "the latter one is given by the known @xmath22-independent schwinger term @xmath23 , while the former rise quickly with the nuclear charge .. ]    another case , that looked even stronger , against a possible role of the self - energy corrections in the pnc problem was made by milstein and sushkov in ref.@xcite .",
    "they presented results of direct analytical calculations claiming that the self - energy corrections are positive and small , concluding that the experimental data on the @xmath6 pnc amplitude in the @xmath1cs atom are in contradiction with the standard model .",
    "the impact of this work was strong , for a long period of time it was considered as a reliable argument indicating that the experimental data can challenge the standard model .",
    "the opposite opinion expressed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which presented a model for rough estimation of the self - energy corrections , was not considered as convincing , probably because the proposed model neglected the vertex corrections and was not gauge invariant .",
    "the analytical calculations of ref.@xcite seemed to prove that the self - energy corrections are small and positive , while some physical arguments mentioned above indicated otherwise . to find the way out of this controversy we proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite an approach that avoided difficult analytical calculations .",
    "this work derived a new equality , we will call it the chiral invariance identity due to reasons explained in section [ equality ] .",
    "it expressed the self - energy corrections for the pnc amplitude in terms of the self - energy corrections to the energy shifts due to fns .",
    "the latter ones were calculated numerically in refs . .",
    "thus the found equality allowed one for the first time to find the accurate self - energy corrections for the pnc amplitude for heavy atoms .",
    "as one could have anticipated , they were large and negative .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath6 transition in@xmath24cs we found @xmath25 that brought the experimental data of wood _ et al _ in agreement with the standard model .",
    "the uncertainty of this result was mainly due to errors of the numerical results of ref .",
    "@xcite that we used as input data .",
    "the most pronounced among them is the error for the self - energy corrections to the energy shift induced by the fns in the @xmath26 wave .",
    "the authors of @xcite , as well as others in the relevant papers above , estimated their results as very reliable for heavy atoms @xmath27 , and less accurate for lighter atoms , making numerical calculations below @xmath28 difficult .    in order to verify and refine our results ,",
    "there were performed analytical calculations of the leading , linear term in the @xmath29-expansion for the self - energy ( and vertex ) corrections for the pnc amplitude @xcite .",
    "the result of this work confirmed that of @xcite , the self - energy corrections were found to be large and negative , in clear contradiction with ref .",
    "@xcite . combining the data of @xcite , which is accurate for heavy atoms , with the analytical data of @xcite that is reliable for light atoms , ref . @xcite found the self - energy corrections for the pnc amplitude for all atoms .",
    "this analysis also allows one to reduce the impact of the above mentioned errors of the data extracted from @xcite .",
    "the result for the @xmath6 transition in @xmath1cs was @xmath30 , in good agreement with @xmath31 of @xcite .",
    "these two works , using different techniques , unambiguously demonstrated that the experimental data of wood _ et al _ @xcite support the standard model .",
    "the contradiction that existed between this statement and conclusions of ref .",
    "@xcite was , fortunately , eradicated by the the work of milstein _ et al _ @xcite that appeared shortly after @xcite .",
    "et al _ arrived at results that are close to ours @xcite . for the @xmath6 transition in @xmath1cs",
    "they found the self - energy corrections to be @xmath32 .",
    "a careful comparison of the results of the two groups presented in ref .",
    "@xcite revealed a similar agreement for all values of @xmath22 . in this latter work",
    "it was also proposed that the remaining small discrepancy is due to limitations of accuracy in calculations of milstein _ et al _ that are based on @xmath33-expansion ( @xmath34 for cs ) .",
    "this conclusion has recently been proved true by milstein _",
    "et al _ who refined their calculations in @xcite .",
    "now , for a vast area of the nuclear charges @xmath22 the results of milstein _ et al _ for the self - energy corrections agree with ours very closely , the remaining deviation is below @xmath35 .",
    "the deviation manifests itself more prominently for large @xmath22 , and we believe that it is still due to those terms of the @xmath36-expansion that remain unaccounted for by the analytical calculations of @xcite .",
    "thus , using several different techniques , the two teams arrived to one and the same result for the self - energy corrections .",
    "the fact that the results of milstein _ et al _ converged to ours after a period of initial deviation makes the final results even more convincing .",
    "the plan of this paper is to discuss in some detail the radiative corrections , summarizing all available methods and data . as an introduction to this study let us first present very briefly several known facts about relativistic corrections in general .",
    "the main relativistic correction is , obviously , the correction that is due to the relativistic nature of the dirac equation that governs the electron propagation .",
    "it is usually taken care of in the initial approximation that relies on the dirac - hartree - fock approach , using then the machinery of the many - body theory to account for the electron correlations .",
    "the next necessary step is to include the relativistic correction to the photon propagator that describes the electron - electron interaction . in the nonrelativistic approach this propagator",
    "is approximated by its coulomb part .",
    "relativistic effects can be taken care of perturbatively , using the breit corrections for this propagator .",
    "this approximate approach is convenient because the breit correction can also be incorporated in the initial hartree - fock mean field and then dealt with by conventional many - body methods . at the same time this approximation provides sufficient accuracy .",
    "the next layer of corrections originates from the qed radiative corrections .",
    "numerically , as well as parametrically , they may be comparable with a contribution of the breit corrections , but it is convenient to consider them separately .",
    "the radiative corrections in the lowest order of the perturbation theory are divided into two classes .",
    "one of them constitutes the qed vacuum polarization , another one consists of the self - energy and the vertex corrections .",
    "these latter two corrections are often grouped together and called the e - line corrections .    the discussion below focuses entirely on the qed radiative corrections .",
    "this presumes that every other above mentioned relativistic correction has been reliably taken care of in the previous research on the atomic pnc problem , see the references discussed above .",
    "the present paper demonstrates that _ all _ radiative corrections have recently been taken into account and calculated reliably .",
    "thus , combining the radiative corrections with the previous theoretical data one can be absolutely certain that _ every _ possible relativistic correction in many - electron atoms is accounted for .",
    "this done , the theory comes up with an important conclusion @xcite : the most accurate available experimental data for parity nonconservation of wood _ et al _ @xcite fully support the standard model .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath37 induced by the @xmath22-boson exchange that describes the pnc part of the weak interaction between the atomic electrons and the nucleus can be presented in the following form ( the relativistic units @xmath38 are used , if not stated otherwise )    @xmath39    here @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the fermi constant and the nuclear weak charge , and @xmath42 is the nuclear density .",
    "the pnc amplitude describes the matrix element that mixes two states of opposite parity for a valence atomic electron . according to eq.([05 ] )",
    "the electron wave function in this matrix element must be taken on the nucleus .",
    "therefore the largest pnc amplitude arises due to the mixing of the @xmath20 and @xmath26 partial waves @xmath43 , here @xmath44 refer to the electron energy states , the electron wave functions are the dirac spinors    @xmath45    @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the large and small radial components of the spinor , @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath50 are the spherical spinors , and @xmath51 .    in applications",
    "the electron wave function is known in some reasonably good approximation ( say , the hartree - fock - dirac initial approximation plus contributions of the many - electron correlations ) .",
    "inevitably there exist a number of perturbations that are not included in this approximation and can affect the electron wave function .",
    "the qed vacuum polarization is one of such perturbations , some others are considered below . in many cases",
    "the perturbation is localized in the vicinity of the nucleus , at distances @xmath52 that are much smaller than the bohr radius of the k - shell @xmath53 .",
    "this is definitely the case for the qed vacuum polarization localized at @xmath54 . for this range of distances",
    "the behavior of the electron wave function is quite simple because it is governed mostly by the pure coulomb field of the nucleus .",
    "one can anticipate therefore that the influence of the perturbation on the electron wave function can be presented in simple terms , directly via the perturbative potential .",
    "this anticipation proves true , there exists a simple way to account for the perturbation that was suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "note that it suffices to find the relative variation of the electron wave function induced by a perturbation .",
    "moreover , for small distances @xmath53 the relative variation does not depend significantly on @xmath52 .",
    "therefore it is sufficient to find the relative variations of the wave function at the origin , i. e. to find @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 are the variations of the large and small components of the wave function due to the considered perturbation , and the relative variations at the origin are taken in the limit @xmath58 .",
    "the limit is necessary because either the large or small components of the wave function vanish at the origin , see eq.([bc ] ) below .",
    "@xcite found for the relative variations of the wave functions the following result    @xmath59    here and below the indices @xmath60 for the wave functions are suppressed to simplify notation , @xmath61 is a parameter with length dimension and @xmath62 is a dimensionless coefficient    @xmath63    @xmath64 is the perturbative potential .",
    "parameters @xmath65 are defined conventionally @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "relations ( [ final]),([a ] ) are presented in absolute units , to make them more convenient for different applications below .",
    "the simple , clear formula ( [ final ] ) solves the problem formulated above , presenting a variation of the wave function at the origin in transparent terms , over the two first moments of the potential .",
    "it is instructive to consider eq.([final ] ) in the nonrelativistic limit that reads    @xmath68    here @xmath69 is the schroedinger nonrelativistic wave function .",
    "deriving eq.([nonrelat ] ) from ( [ final ] ) one uses the fact that according to ( [ a ] ) the parameter @xmath61 goes to zero in the limit @xmath70 , while from ( [ k ] ) one finds @xmath71 .",
    "there is a simple short - cut derivation that leads to ( [ nonrelat ] ) .",
    "one expresses the variation of the schroedinger electron wave function via the green function @xmath72    @xmath73    approximating the green function by the green function for free motion @xmath74",
    "@xmath75    where @xmath76 is the green function for the free motion in the @xmath77-th partial wave , @xmath78 , and the last identity in eq.([g0 ] ) takes into account the fact that the binding energy of the valence electron is negligible for short distances .",
    "remembering that for nonrelativistic motion the wave function behaves like @xmath79 one immediately derives eq.([nonrelat ] ) from eq.([delta ] ) .",
    "the point to be noted in this simple derivation is the dominance of the kinetic term in the nonrelativistic limit . for small distances",
    "the nonrelativistic kinetic energy behaves as @xmath80 , being larger than the potential energy .",
    "that is why eq.([g0 ] ) holds in the nonrelativistic limit . in the relativistic approach",
    "the situation is different .",
    "the kinetic term behaves as @xmath81 , while the potential behaves as @xmath82 .",
    "one has to expect henceforth that the contribution of the coulomb potential energy to the final answer is to be suppressed compared with the contribution of the kinetic term only by a factor @xmath36 .",
    "this is exactly what happens in eq.([final ] ) .",
    "the second term @xmath83 on the right - hand side can be considered as a mere modification of the nonrelativistic result , while the first one @xmath84 is the expected new term proportional to @xmath36 .",
    "thus the structure of eq.([final ] ) is predetermined .",
    "the calculations of ref . @xcite",
    "establish the coefficients in this relation as well as the dependence on higher powers of the @xmath36-expansion that appear through the parameter @xmath85 .",
    "the nonrelativistic eq.([nonrelat ] ) shows that the parameter that governs the variation of the wave function is @xmath86 that is almost an obvious result valid for a variety of quantum mechanical problems @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that relativistic eq.([final ] ) shows that there exists another relativistic parameter @xmath87 .",
    "it is suppressed compared with the nonrelativistic one only by a factor @xmath33 that is not small for heavy atoms .",
    "this suppression can be well compensated for if the potential increases at small distances which makes @xmath88 larger than @xmath89 . in this case",
    "the new relativistic parameter becomes dominant , as the examples below demonstrate .",
    "the singular rise of the potential at small distances is typically smeared out by the finite nuclear size . dealing with such singular potentials it is important to keep in mind that the first term on the right - hand side of eq.([final ] ) is proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "therefore it originates from those distances where the full strength of the electric field created by the nuclear charge is present , i. e. from the region outside the nuclear core @xmath90 . inside the nucleus the coulomb field created by the nuclear charge diminishes , making this region less important . in order to estimate its contribution",
    ", one can introduce for distances @xmath91 an effective nuclear charge @xmath92 that diminishes with the nuclear radius taking into account the decline of the electric field inside the nucleus . correspondingly modifying the parameter @xmath61 in eq.([final ] )    @xmath93    one can apply this equation for the region @xmath94 .",
    "we will see that this approximate procedure gives sensible results for the vacuum polarization , see eqs.([w])-([w2 ] ) .",
    "let us apply eq.([final ] ) to the pnc problem , in which one needs to calculate the pnc matrix element @xmath95 .",
    "both @xmath20 and @xmath26 wave functions are influenced by the perturbation @xmath64 .",
    "therefore the relative variation of the pnc amplitude can be found simply by adding variations of @xmath20 and @xmath26 states given in eq.([final ] )    @xmath96    here @xmath97 is the variation of the pnc matrix element due to variations of the wave functions created by the potential @xmath64 . deriving this result we take into account that essential parameters for the @xmath20 and @xmath26 states are @xmath98 and define @xmath62 in ( [ weak ] ) to be @xmath99 .",
    "it was assumed in eq.([final ] ) that the perturbative potential is a scalar . in applications",
    "it is necessary also to deal with more sophisticated , tensor - type perturbations .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields created by the nuclear dipole , quadrupole and higher moments give examples of such perturbations .",
    "it is interesting that eq.([final ] ) can be generalized to describe the tensor - type perturbations in simple clear terms .",
    "suppose that we have the valence electron described by the dirac spinor @xmath100 ( the energy of the valence electron is so low that we can neglect it , suppressing the irrelevant index @xmath101 ) .",
    "suppose that there is some tensor perturbation @xmath102 .",
    "when we consider the pnc amplitude we need to evaluate the wave function at the nucleus .",
    "there are only two partial waves that remain large at the origin , @xmath20 and @xmath26 .",
    "this means that in the multipole expansion of the @xmath103 term in the dirac equation only these two partial waves contribute .",
    "the angular structure of these partial waves is predetermined , compare eq.([spinor ] ) , therefore we may write    @xmath104_{l,1/2 } =       \\left (         \\begin{array}{cc } f_{l,1/2}(r)\\omega_{1/2,l,\\mu}({\\bf n } ) \\\\",

    "eq.([partial ] ) shows that the contribution of the term @xmath108 to the dirac equation is expressed in terms of the scalar functions @xmath109 and @xmath110 with @xmath111 .",
    "we can introduce now some _ effective _",
    "potentials @xmath112 , @xmath113 that satisfy the following conditions    @xmath114    here @xmath115 are the known large and small components of the nonperturbed wave function for the valence electron in the @xmath106 partial wave .",
    "the procedure described shows that the term @xmath108 in the dirac equation at small distances can be described by the effective potentials @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( which can be different for the large and the small components for an arbitrary perturbation ) .",
    "correspondingly , the variation of the wave function @xmath118 at small distances can be expressed via its multipole expansion in which only the @xmath20 and @xmath26 states are retained    @xmath119    here the functions @xmath120 describe the admixture of the @xmath106 states to the function @xmath100 that arise due to the tensor - type perturbation .",
    "they are to be found from the dirac equation .",
    "we see that the complicated multipole problem is reduced to the problem with the scalar potential , the only distinction is that the role of the scalar potential plays the effective potentials @xmath121 defined above .",
    "however , this distinction makes no difference , we introduce the effective scalar potentials in the dirac equation and solve it regardless of the nature of the potentials .",
    "we can rely on the discussion in @xcite to derive formulas similar to eq.([final ] ) .",
    "the result reads    @xmath122    remember that here @xmath123 describe the admixture of @xmath124 states that arise in the wave function @xmath100 of the valence electron in the state with the quantum numbers @xmath125 under the influence of the tensor - type perturbation @xmath102 , while @xmath126 describe the wave function of the valence electron in the state with the quantum numbers @xmath106 .",
    "the latter ones are the same as the ones used in eqs.([effect1]),([effect2 ] ) to define the effective potentials .",
    "this makes our results presented in eqs.([eff1]),([eff2 ] ) independent of the normalization of the wave functions @xmath126 .",

    "the quantum numbers in eqs.([a]),([k ] ) that define the parameters @xmath127 in the right - hand sides of eqs.([eff1]),([eff2 ] ) correspond to the state @xmath124 .",
    "we see that for an arbitrary tensor - type potential the result remains very simple .",
    "the only modification , compared with the simplest scalar case , is that one needs first to define the effective potentials using eqs .",
    "( [ effect1]),([effect2 ] ) .    summarizing , we described in this section simple useful procedures that express the variation of the valence electron wave function at the origin directly in terms of the perturbative potential .",
    "the vacuum polarization in the lowest order of perturbation theory is described by the uehling potential @xmath128 @xcite    @xmath129    importantly , the uehling potential ( [ uehling ] ) is singular at the origin , its asymptotic for @xmath130 reads    @xmath131    the singularity is smeared out by the nuclear finite size @xmath132 . in eq.([uo ] ) @xmath133 is the euler constant .",

    "we conclude that all reported calculations for the vacuum polarization correction are in very good agreement , distinctions between results derived by different methods and by different groups are all below @xmath171 .",
    "let us discuss now possible corrections to the results discussed above .",

    "the corresponding generalization of the uehling potential was given by fullerton and rinker @xcite . in order to estimate its contribution",
    "we need to remember that the main @xmath172 term in eq.([log2 ] ) originates from the integration well outside of the nuclear radius where the uehling potential is very close to the one of fullerton and rinker .",
    "therefore this main part of the correction is not changed .",
    "modifications could arise only for the integration in the vicinity of the nuclear surface , but this region by itself gives only a fraction ( @xmath173 ) of the total correction , while the relative difference of the uehling potential and the fullerton and rinker potential on the nuclear surface is small .",
    "for all atoms it remains @xmath174 , as we found by direct numerical comparison of the uehling potential with the fullerton and rinker potential .",
    "we conclude that the modification of the vacuum polarization due to the finite nuclear size is irrelevant .",
    "another possible modification can originate from the qed higher - order corrections that contribute to the vacuum polarization .",
    "one of them stems from the fact that the landau pole requires that the linear in @xmath175 term in eq.([uo ] ) be followed by higher - order logarithmic terms .",
    "however , the corresponding series runs in powers of @xmath176 , giving small contributions for higher order terms @xmath177",
    ".    consider now a modification of the uehling potential that is due to the fact that the coulomb field of the nucleus disturbs the virtual electron - positron pair .",
    "this effect is conveniently described with the help of the wichmann - kroll potential @xcite that , compared to eq.([uehling ] ) , describes the next term in the @xmath36-expansion .",
    "for estimates it is sufficient to take the wichmann - kroll potential at small distances , where its asymptotic @xmath178 reads @xcite :    @xmath179    using eq.([weak ] ) one immediately finds from eq.([wk ] ) the ratio of the correction induced by the wichmann - kroll potential to the uehling correction    @xmath180    as was found in @xcite . for @xmath1cs",
    "this ratio is about @xmath181 , demonstrating that the correction due to the wichmann - kroll potential is very small .",
    "thus all higher order qed terms in the vacuum polarization are negligible .    alongside the vacuum polarization",
    "there exists also another polarization effect , namely the polarization of the nucleus .",
    "one can estimate its influence on the electron wave functions and the pnc matrix element with the help of the conventional polarization potential @xmath182 that is created by the nucleus    @xmath183    here @xmath184 is the static nuclear dipole polarizability . it can be estimated roughly assuming that the total oscillator strength for the nuclear dipole excitations is located at the energy of nuclear giant dipole resonance @xmath185 . then , using the conventional sum rule for the oscillator strengths one finds    @xmath186    where @xmath187 is the proton mass . since the potential ( [ nucpol ] ) increases at small separations the main contribution in eq.([weak ] )",
    "is given by the first term in eq.([weak ] ) which should be integrated outside the nuclear radius @xmath188 , as was explained above .",
    "having this in mind , one substitutes ( [ nucpol ] ) in ( [ weak ] ) finding an estimate for the influence of the nuclear polarization on the pnc matrix element    @xmath189    for the @xmath1cs atom we take @xmath190 mev obtaining @xmath191 that shows that the nuclear polarization is negligible .",
    "this conclusion agrees with estimates of milstein and sushkov @xcite , who proposed that the effect is of the order of @xmath192 , which numerically is close to eq.([pncnucpol ] ) .    summarizing , we demonstrated above that the qed vacuum polarization gives a large positive correction ( @xmath14 ) to the pnc amplitude .",
    "contributions of higher order qed corrections are much smaller .",
    "this means that the influence of the nuclear coulomb potential on the virtual electron - positron pair is not pronounced , possibly due to opposite signs of the virtual particles .",
    "we will see below that for a single electron the situation is different , the coulomb field does play an important role for the self - energy correction , see eq.([197 ] ) .",
    "the influence of the finite nuclear size on the vacuum polarization was found to be nonessential , the polarization can be well described by the simplest uehling potential . also negligible",
    "is the polarization of the nucleus .",
    "we presented above in some detail analytical methods of calculation , paying less attention to purely numerical methods that have played a very important role in the problem , see @xcite .",
    "omissions of details in our presentation of numerical methods is justified by the fact that the vacuum polarization is described by a sufficiently simple potential , which can be incorporated in the initial hartree - fock - dirac approximation for the atomic electrons , and then dealt with by conventional methods of many - body theory .",
    "thus the numerical approach follows the mainstream of atomic structure calculations discussed in some detail elsewhere , see for example @xcite .",
    "overall , the polarization is a well understood , robust effect that is well described by eqs.([w])-([w2 ] ) .",
    "let us show , following ref.@xcite , that there exists an interesting and useful relation that gives the qed radiative corrections to the pnc matrix element via similar radiative corrections to another quantity , the energy shifts of the atomic electron induced by the finite nuclear size ( fns ) .",
    "this relation can be written as    @xmath193    where @xmath194 is the relative radiative correction to the pnc matrix element between the @xmath20 and @xmath26 orbitals    @xmath195    the energy difference between the considered opposite parity orbitals @xmath196 ev is much lower than a typical excitation energy @xmath197 mev that governs the radiative corrections .",
    "we can therefore neglect this difference assuming that @xmath198 .",
    "this assumption makes the correction @xmath199 gauge invariant . to make this argument more transparent",
    ", one can use the coulomb approximation for the atomic field and consider the degenerate coulomb @xmath200 and @xmath201 levels .",
    "the problem of gauge invariance can be viewed from another perspective .",
    "one can consider the full pnc amplitude . alongside the pnc matrix element it includes also the conventional e1 amplitude and the corresponding energy denominator .",
    "the pnc amplitude describes the events on the mass shell , the photon frequency in the e1 transition equals the excitation energy of the atom .",
    "therefore the amplitude is definitely gauge invariant . considering the radiative corrections in the lowest order , one can separate them into corrections to the pnc matrix element , the lamb - shift corrections to the energies , and the corrections to the e1 transition .",
    "their sum is definitely gauge invariant .",
    "the point is that the latter two corrections are known to compensate each other almost completely @xcite .",
    "the only remaining corrections are the ones which are associated with the pnc matrix element . thus these latter corrections are gauge invariant . to make this discussion complete ,",
    "let us mention also that in the perturbation theory approach outlined in the next section [ zalpha ] the gauge invariance of the pnc matrix element is self - evident .",
    "there is no doubt , therefore , that one can assume that the radiative corrections to the pnc matrix element are gauge invariant .",
    "the quantities @xmath202 and @xmath203 in eq.([d ] ) are the relative radiative corrections to the fns energy shifts @xmath204 for the chosen @xmath20 and @xmath26 electron states    @xmath205    the fns energy shifts can be presented as matrix elements of the potential @xmath206 that describes the deviation of the nuclear potential from the pure coulomb one inside the nucleus due to the spread of the nuclear charge    @xmath207    equality ( [ ddd ] ) may be established for the sum of all qed radiative corrections ( @xmath208 ) , or specified for any gauge invariant class of them .",
    "we will discuss first the self - energy and vertex corrections , restricting our consideration to the lowest order of perturbation theory presented by the feynman diagrams in fig.[two ] , calling them the e - line corrections .",
    "later we will switch our attention to the vacuum polarization and demonstrate that it satisfies ( [ ddd ] ) as well .    the intermediate electron states in diagrams of fig .",
    "[ two ] are described by the propagator @xmath209 , with @xmath210 , where @xmath211 is the relativistic electron energy , @xmath212 is the atomic potential that includes the potential created by the nucleus with fns and , generally speaking , the screening potential of atomic electrons .",
    "the latter one is not important at small distances , but it still can be accounted for by the formalism . for the relativistic propagator we use the same symbol @xmath72 that was applied previously for the nonrelativistic green function in eq.([delta ] ) , which should not produce confusion . at small distances",
    "the exchange potential is negligible , therefore the potential is local .",
    "the external legs of the diagrams describe the wave functions @xmath213 and @xmath214 for the considered @xmath20 and @xmath26 levels .",
    "let us note first that in the region of short distances the following relations hold    @xmath215    they follow from the chiral invariance that manifests itself at small distances .",
    "for @xmath216 the mass term in the dirac equation becomes smaller than the kinetic term ( @xmath217 ) .",
    "for even smaller distances @xmath218 the potential ( @xmath219 ) also exceeds the mass term .",
    "therefore for small distances we can neglect the mass @xmath220 , using the resulting chiral invariance for our advantages . since eqs.([prop]),([wf ] ) will be important for us , we examine them in some detail . in order to prove eq.([prop ] ) one neglects the mass term in the electron propagator assuming that    @xmath221    then , the identity @xmath222 leads to @xmath223 that results in ( [ prop ] ) . in order to verify eq .",
    "( [ wf ] ) let us write down the conventional dirac equations for the large @xmath224 and small @xmath225 components of the electron wave function ( [ spinor ] )    @xmath226    here we omitted the indexes @xmath227 , distinguishing the states by the parameter @xmath228 that takes the values @xmath229 and @xmath230 for the @xmath20 and @xmath26 states respectively . for small separations",
    "one can neglect in eqs.([dirac1]),([dirac2 ] ) the mass term @xmath231 .",
    "after that we observe that the equations become invariant under a substitution @xmath232 remember now that according to eq.([spinor ] ) the @xmath20 and @xmath26 wave functions have the form    @xmath233    here the two component spinor @xmath234 depends on the projection of the total momentum @xmath235 , @xmath236 for @xmath237 , and @xmath238 for @xmath239 .",
    "it follows from eq.([sp ] ) that    @xmath240    where we took into account that in the standard representation considered for the dirac matrixes    @xmath241    from eq.([g5p]),([sp ] ) one observes that eq.([wf ] ) can be presented as    @xmath242    we see that these latter relations coincide with eq.([1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "the first substitution @xmath243 in ( [ 1 - 1 ] ) exchanges equations for the @xmath20 and @xmath26 states , while the two others are identical to eqs.([fg ] ) and ( [ gf ] ) respectively .",
    "thus the verified above eqs.([1 - 1 ] ) prove validity of eq.([wf ] ) .    at this point one may recall a subtlety , a symmetry of the dirac equation revealed by eqs.([1 - 1 ] ) is , generally speaking , not sufficient .",
    "one needs to verify also that the boundary conditions satisfy same symmetry as well .",
    "however , one can argue that the boundary conditions arise as a physical complement to the dirac equation and , therefore , the symmetry of the equation should automatically result in the symmetry of the boundary conditions . to verify",
    "this argument one can recall that for the finite nuclear charge distribution the boundary conditions at the origin read simply    @xmath244    where @xmath245 .",
    "eqs.([bc ] ) explicitly demonstrate that indeed , the boundary conditions are invariant under the substitution eq.([1 - 1 ] ) .",
    "this completes our verification of eq.([wf ] ) .",
    "the constant @xmath246 in ( [ wf ] ) , which depends on the normalization conditions , will be irrelevant for us because we are interested in relative quantities that appear in eq.([ddd ] ) where this constant will be canceled out .",
    "it is instructive to look at numerical verifications of eq.([wf ] ) shown in fig.[three ] . supporting the proof given above , they provide also details that are cumbersome for analytic treatment .",
    "fig.[three ] ( a ) shows that eq.([fg ] ) , which according to the discussion above holds at small distances @xmath247 , remains approximately valid at sufficiently large distances , up to ( and even beyond ) the compton radius @xmath54 .",
    "in contrast , eq.([gf ] ) is applicable only at small @xmath248 as shown in fig .",
    "[ three ] ( b ) , being violated at @xmath249 , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ three](a ) .",
    "we can remember , however , that the dominant contribution to the pnc matrix element arises from the @xmath250 and @xmath251 functions , which are both large for @xmath252 , much larger than the other two functions @xmath253 . since these large functions satisfy eq.([fg ] ) even at sufficiently large distances @xmath54 , one can also rely in this region on eq.([wf ] ) .",
    "we will exploit this opportunity at some later stage below , but our prime interest is related to the distances as small as the nuclear radius @xmath254 , where we verified beyond doubt that eqs.([prop]),([wf ] ) hold , see fig.[three ] ( b ) .",

    "[ two ] that describe the self - energy correction for the pnc amplitude .",
    "the thick lines in this figure represent the electron propagation in the atomic field , the dot vertex is the pnc interaction described by eq.([05 ] ) , and the dashed line shows the photon . let us specify that the left and right legs of these diagrams describe the @xmath20 and @xmath26 states respectively .",
    "the pnc interaction ( [ 05 ] ) is located at small distances @xmath255 .",

    "the @xmath258 function in this diagram enters the pnc interaction that makes its argument @xmath259 localized inside the nucleus , @xmath260 .",
    "this allows us to use eq.([wf ] ) deriving    @xmath261    here and below we use the symbol of identity ( @xmath262 ) that simply means dropping the irrelevant constant @xmath246 introduced in eq.([prop ] ) ( that is canceled out when the relative contribution of the correction is considered anyway ) .",
    "eq.([se(b ) ] ) uses conventional notation , @xmath263 and @xmath72 are the self - energy operator and the electron propagator mentioned above .",
    "the right - hand side of this relation shows that we can look at the diagram ( b ) as the one that describes the diagonal @xmath165 transition induced by an effective scalar potential @xmath264 .",

    "the diagram describes the @xmath165 transitions that are induced by the short - range scalar potentials .",
    "the only distinction comes from the fact that the potentials @xmath266 and @xmath267 possess different profiles .    this latter difference , however , proves to be irrelevant . in order to see this we need to discuss the integral with a short - range potential that arises in the diagram .",
    "its integrand includes the potential ( i. e. @xmath266 for the pnc amplitude and @xmath268 for the fns energy shift ) , the electron wave function @xmath269 and the electron propagator @xmath270 .",
    "the wave function and the propagator inside the nucleus are almost constants , see discussion of this fact below . taking them out of the integration we observe that the considered sophisticated integral is simplified , being reduced to the integral over the potential itself @xmath271 .",
    "it is easy to see that the same integral arises in the non - perturbed matrix element .",
    "therefore in the relative contribution of the correction this integral is canceled out , and the result does not depend on the potential at all . this conclusion is valid for any short - range potential .",
    "thus the relative contribution of the diagram ( b ) proves to be one and the same for the pnc and the fns problems .",
    "this means that the relative contribution of the diagram ( b ) to the pnc matrix element equals half of its relative contribution to the energy shift of the @xmath20 state due to fns .",
    "the mentioned factor @xmath272 takes into account the fact that the energy shift is induced by the two diagrams ( b ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ two ] that are identical for the fns problem .    before proceeding further ,",
    "let us discuss the behavior of the electron wave functions inside the nucleus which was exploited in the above derivation .",
    "note that inside the nucleus the large functions @xmath273 and @xmath274 exhibit smooth , almost constant behavior , as demonstrates fig .",
    "[ three ] .",
    "the reason for this effect stems from the fact that inside the nucleus the electric field rapidly diminishes with the radius . the functions @xmath275 and @xmath276 ,",
    "show some variation , but it remains very mild . assessing consequences of this smooth variation one can recall that , firstly , the integration volume @xmath277 enhances the contribution of the nuclear surface region where these functions are very smooth indeed , as shows fig . [",
    "three ] ( b ) .",
    "secondly , their role is not prominent anyway , simply because they are smaller than the functions @xmath278 .",
    "therefore they can be well approximated by constants .",
    "thus both @xmath20 and @xmath26 states are well described by constant - type functions inside the nucleus .",
    "this fact was used above for the @xmath20 state , the argument is repeated below for the @xmath26 state .",
    "we also presumed above that the propagator @xmath270 does not depend on the variable @xmath259 , when @xmath147 .",
    "this statement follows from the simple fact that the coordinate @xmath279 gives the location of the point where the radiation of the photon takes place , therefore @xmath280 .",
    "the smallness of @xmath52 compared with @xmath281 justifies its neglect in the propagator .    examining the diagram fig.[two ] ( c ) we use the same arguments as we exploited above for the ( b ) diagram proving that its relative contribution to the pnc amplitude equals half of its relative contribution to the energy shift due to fns of the @xmath26 state .",
    "combining our results for the diagrams ( b ) and ( c ) we conclude that the self - energy corrections ( superscript se ) described by these diagrams comply with eq.([ddd ] )    @xmath282    the given derivation does not use any specific gauge condition , therefore it is gauge invariant .",
    "consider now the vertex correction ( a ) in fig .",
    "an analytical expression for it can be written in the conventional form @xmath283 where @xmath284 here @xmath285 is the photon propagator , @xmath286 is the four - vector of the photon momentum .",

    "we can simplify therefore eq.([vertex ] ) factorizing the interaction over @xmath291    @xmath292    where we put @xmath293 in the arguments of the propagators .",
    "we observe that the potential arises only in a factor @xmath294 that is separated from all other elements of the diagram .",
    "the same factor appears in the main term of the pnc amplitude .",
    "therefore the relative contribution of the vertex correction does not depend on the potential at all .",
    "remember that the same property is exhibited by the self - energy correction discussed above .",
    "the variables @xmath295 describe the radiation processes and therefore are expected to be of the order of the compton radius @xmath296 .",
    "let us consider the implications that arise if one presumes that the region of small separations    @xmath297    gives the dominant contribution to the integral in eq.([vertex ] ) .",
    "we can engage in this region eqs.([prop]),([wf ] ) .",
    "the first of them allows one to exchange the @xmath298 matrix in eq.([r0 ] ) with the propagator @xmath72 .",
    "one can also transpose it with the vertexes @xmath299 . using several such transpositions",
    "we can bring the @xmath300 matrix from its central position in expression ( [ r0 ] ) to the side , where it hits the external wave function .",
    "after that we use eq.([wf ] ) for this function . repeating the procedure twice , one time shifting @xmath298 to the left , and another one to the right we derive    @xmath301    to simplify notation we dropped here the total momentum @xmath272 from the indexes in the wave functions ( i. e. @xmath302 etc ) , and omitted the energy variable in the propagators ( this variable equals @xmath303 for all propagators ) .",
    "the point of these transformation is that the @xmath298 matrix disappears from the right - hand sides of eqs.([l]),([r ] ) .",
    "substituting these two expressions back in eqs.([r0 ] ) , ( [ vertex ] ) we find that the relative contribution of the vertex diagram ( a ) to the pnc matrix element can be expressed either as a matrix element of the @xmath165 transition , or the matrix element of the @xmath304 transition .",
    "we recognize in these two matrix elements the relative contributions to the energy shifts due to fns for the @xmath20 and @xmath26 states respectively .",
    "this latter conclusion takes advantage of the fact discussed above that the profile of the short - range potential does not influence the relative correction , one can conveniently choose the potential to be @xmath264 or @xmath305 .",
    "this discussion demonstrates that the vertex ( superscript v ) corrections to the pnc amplitude and to the energy shifts due to fns prove to be approximately equal    @xmath306    combining eqs.([ds]),([v ] ) we find that the total e - line corrections , i. e. the self - energy plus the vertex correction , satisfy eq.([ddd ] ) .    the derivation presented above exploits eq.([rr ] ) presuming that the small distances are dominant in the vertex correction .",
    "there are reasons indicating that this assumption does not put restrictions on the derived result ( [ ddd ] ) . as a first attempt one can try to exploit the behavior of the wave functions @xmath307 .",
    "[ three ] shows that they approximately satisfy eq.([wf ] ) even at sufficiently large separations , of the order of the compton radius @xmath308 .",
    "this shows that eq.([l ] ) remains approximately applicable even if the integration region includes sufficiently large separations @xmath309 .",
    "this , in turn , demonstrates that the first equality in eq.([v ] ) , i. e. @xmath310 also remains approximately valid .",
    "this is a positive result .",
    "however , this fact alone is not sufficient .",
    "the second equality in eq.([v ] ) proves to be much more sensitive to the essential integration region because the wave functions @xmath311 fail to satisfy eq.([wf ] ) at @xmath312 .",
    "we need therefore to be more careful .",
    "let us recall at this stage that the range of distances @xmath313 where the radiation processes take place depends on the chosen gauge for the electromagnetic field .",
    "it is well known that the usual length - gauge favors larger distances , while the velocity and , especially , acceleration forms , make the smaller distances contribute more to the radiation process .",
    "these known examples show that the region that contributes to the radiation process is _ not _ gauge invariant .",
    "this is important .",
    "if the radiation region is not gauge invariant , then we are able to choose a gauge in which this region is located close to the nucleus , inside the zone defined by eq.([rr ] ) . in this gauge the above derivation is valid and eq.([v ] ) for the vertex is correct .",

    "is derived in one particular gauge means that it is valid in any gauge , as was proposed in @xcite .",
    "let us summarize the above discussion .",
    "we argued that the calculations can be organized in such a way that all important events happen at small distances . in this region",
    "the chiral invariance holds , resulting in eqs.([prop]),([wf ] ) and , consequently , in eq.([ddd ] ) .",
    "thus this latter equality expresses the fundamental and simple fact . at small , nuclear distances",
    "the chiral invariance governs the problem .",
    "consequently , eq.([ddd ] ) that follows from it , can be called the chiral invariance identity .",
    "let us estimate the accuracy of eq.([ddd ] ) .",
    "the above derivation used the gauge in which the radiation processes for the diagram ( a ) take place mostly at small distances @xmath314 .",
    "they should also take place outside the nucleus @xmath315 , as is necessary to justify our presumption that the shape of the potential inside the nucleus is irrelevant . from the last two inequalities we find that the derivation relies on a parameter @xmath316 .",
    "this determines the magnitude of the error ( few per cent ) of eq.([ddd ] ) .",
    "similarly one considers the contribution of the qed vacuum polarization .",
    "eqs.([final]),([a ] ) and ( [ k ] ) present explicit variations for @xmath20 and @xmath26 wave functions at the origin induced by the vacuum polarization . using these wave functions to calculate corrections to the pnc matrix element and fns energy shifts",
    ", one immediately finds that the chiral invariance identity ( [ ddd ] ) holds for the vacuum polarization as well .",
    "this fact is in line with eq.([ds ] ) for the self - energy corrections .",
    "the proof of ( [ ddd ] ) for the vacuum polarization stops here because one need not care about the complicated vertex corrections .",
    "note that we do not consider above the radiative corrections of the order @xmath317 which appear in the plane wave approximation .",
    "these contributions have been included into the radiative corrections to the weak charge @xmath318 ( and the renormalization of the charge and electron mass in the case of fns energy shifts ) .",
    "correspondingly , we subtract the contribution of the plane waves from eq.([ddd ] ) , considering only the part of the corrections that depends on the atomic potential @xmath319 . for heavy atoms",
    "this subtlety is insignificant numerically because the considered @xmath22-dependent part of the correction is bigger than the omitted @xmath22-independent one , as we will see below .",
    "the chiral invariance identity ( [ ddd ] ) dives the e - line corrections to the pnc matrix element , which are difficult to calculate , in terms of the corrections to the fns energy shifts that have been well - studied both numerically , by johnson and soff @xcite , blundell @xcite , cheng _",
    "et al _ @xcite and lindgren _ et al _ @xcite , and analytically , by pachucki @xcite and eides and grotch and eides _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "@xcite presents the e - line radiative corrections to the fns energy shifts for @xmath320 , @xmath321 and @xmath322 levels in hydrogenlike ions with atomic charges @xmath323 .",
    "( [ ddd ] ) contains relative corrections , therefore we needed to calculate the fns energy shifts @xmath324 .",
    "this was done in @xcite by solving the dirac equation with the conventional fermi - type nuclear distribution @xmath325 \\ } $ ] .",
    "parameters @xmath326 were taken the same as in @xcite , namely @xmath327 fm and @xmath246 chosen to satisfy @xmath328 fm .    using the results of @xcite and this calculation we obtained in @xcite the relative radiative corrections shown in fig . [ four ] . in order to include the interesting case @xmath28 and to account for all values of @xmath329 we used interpolating formulae presented in @xcite , as well as data of @xcite .",
    "the relative corrections for the @xmath330 and @xmath331 levels are approximately the same size .",
    "this indicates that the radiative processes responsible for the correction take place at separations much smaller than the k - shell radius , @xmath332 , which is consistent with the assumption @xmath54 above . for these separations",
    "we can assume that , firstly , the screening of the nuclear coulomb field in manyelectron atoms does not produce any significant effect , and , secondly , the relative corrections do not depend on the atomic energy level because for small separations all atomic @xmath200-wave functions exhibit similar behavior .",
    "these arguments remain valid for the @xmath26 states as well , permitting us to presume that the results shown in fig .",
    "[ four ] for the @xmath321-levels and @xmath322-levels of hydrogenlike ions remain valid for @xmath20 and @xmath26 states of the valence electron in a manyelectron atom .",
    "we obtain the e - line radiative corrections for the pnc matrix element using the identity ( [ ddd ] ) that expresses them via the found corrections to the fns energy shifts .",
    "the found pnc corrections , presented in fig . [ four ] by the dotted line , are negative and large . for the @xmath1cs atom",
    "the correction is @xmath333 , for tl it is @xmath334 .",
    "the result for @xmath1cs is important because it indicated for the first time that the radiative corrections reconcile the experimental data of wood _ et al _ @xcite with the standard model @xcite .",
    "a notable feature of the self - energy corrections presented in fig . [ four ] is their close similarity .",
    "the corrections to the fns energy shifts for both @xmath20 and @xmath26 states , as well as for the pnc amplitude , have large negative contributions from the qed self - energy , which monotonically and very smoothly increase with the nuclear charge .",
    "this observation brings us back to the point mentioned in section [ intro ] .",
    "the large and negative contribution of the self - energy for heavy atoms is exactly what one _ should _ expect from it .",
    "anything else would be a surprise . in order to verify this point",
    "one can try to apply the approach outlined to some other problem , for example to the hyperfine interaction hfi which has been carefully examined previously , see detailed discussions in @xcite and references therein .    with this purpose one can try to derive the chiral invariance identity for the hfi .",
    "the problem is that the hfi has a long - range tail @xmath335 that is prominent in the region where the chiral invariance is violated .",
    "however , if one believes that convergence of the hfi matrix elements is fast enough , then the following equality    @xmath336    that was proposed in @xcite should hold at least approximately . here",
    "@xmath337 is the radiative correction to the hfi for @xmath20-levels , the primed notation indicates that the @xmath22-independent schwinger term @xmath338 should be excluded . for heavy atoms",
    "this subtlety is not important , since the contribution from the coulomb - induced corrections is much stronger than the @xmath22-independent schwinger term .",
    "fig.[four ] shows the e - line contribution to @xmath339 that was extracted in @xcite from data of @xcite using interpolation for all values of @xmath22 considered there .",
    "it agrees semi - quantitatively with eq.([hfi ] ) , the deviation is less than 33 % .",
    "we observe again the same trend , the self - energy correction is large and negative , in accordance with the clear physical reasons mentioned in section [ intro ] .",
    "another positive conclusion is that chiral invariance identities similar to ( [ hfi ] ) can be applicable even for those potentials that spread out of the nuclear core .",
    "the approach outlined raises two points .",
    "firstly , it is interesting to have an estimate for the self - energy correction in simple terms , that would not appeal to sophisticated numerical calculations .",
    "secondly , it is important to derive the self - energy corrections for lighter elements .",
    "direct numerical calculations are difficult for them because the error rapidly increases for lighter atoms .",
    "the main source for the error is the fns energy shift for the @xmath26 state .",
    "the lightest element for which the self - energy corrections have been calculated is cs , where the error for the fns energy shift in the @xmath26 wave was @xmath340 @xcite . exactly this error results in the uncertainty of the above mentioned result @xmath31 . for heavier atoms",
    "the numerical errors of @xcite rapidly decrease .",
    "therefore the main error in our result for very heavy ( @xmath341 ) atoms is associated with the validity of eq.([ddd ] ) , that was estimated above as a few percent .",
    "the estimate for the magnitude of the effect and calculations for lighter elements can be conveniently performed with the help of the @xmath342-expansion considered in the next section .",
    "let us consider the perturbation theory for the e - line corrections .",
    "in the initial approximation one describes the electron using plane waves and consequently including in the perturbation theory three types of processes .",
    "firstly , the pnc interaction , secondly , the e - line corrections , and , thirdly , the coulomb interaction .",
    "taking the nuclear coulomb field as a perturbation one can formulate the perturbation theory in powers of the nuclear charge @xmath22 .",
    "the parameter that governs the corresponding expansion is @xmath343 , where @xmath101 is the order of the perturbation theory .",
    "this statement follows from a conventional , well known result @xcite . in the coulomb problem",
    "the perturbation runs in powers of @xmath344 , where @xmath345 is a typical velocity of the electron . for short distances",
    "@xmath346 , thus @xmath347 .",
    "the type of expansion considered typically includes some additional large logarithmic factors , as specified below . in the lowest order of perturbation theory",
    "the simplest , linear in @xmath22 correction is @xmath348 .",
    "thus formulated problem requires calculation of the relevant coefficients that can be achieved using the corresponding feynman diagrams .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the e - line corrections in the first order of perturbation theory over the coulomb field are presented in fig .",
    ". the direct calculation of these diagrams for the pnc amplitude gives the following result for the relative contribution of the e - line corrections to the pnc amplitude    @xmath349    it was first obtained in @xcite that had an amusing history @xcite .",
    "the index 1 in the superscript of ( [ 197 ] ) reminds one that this is the linear in @xmath22 correction . for the @xmath1cs atom eq.([197 ] ) gives @xmath19 , which is in line with the result @xmath350 that follows from the chiral invariance identity ( [ ddd ] ) as discussed in the previous section . an earlier attempt of milstein and sushkov @xcite gave the coefficient @xmath351 , instead of @xmath352 in eq.([197 ] ) .",
    "this distinction had important implications . based on their",
    "result the authors of @xcite claimed that there existed the contradiction between the experimental data of @xcite and the standard model , while eq.([197 ] ) indicated that the experimental data agree with the model .",
    "fortunately , the controversy was soon resolved by milstein _",
    "et al _ in the following ref.@xcite that agreed with ( [ 197 ] ) and found also an analytical expression for the coefficient in this equation that reads @xmath353 .",
    "this result has also been confirmed in recent ref.@xcite .    at this point",
    "it is worth returning to the problem of gauge invariance .",
    "it is easy to demonstrate by conventional methods that the sum of all the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ five ] is gauge invariant .",
    "this fact should be compared with the discussion of the gauge invariance in section [ equality ] , see after eq.([ddd ] ) . however , for practical applications one often fixes the gauge because this allows one to simplify lengthy analytical calculations .",
    "this is the way the calculations were performed in @xcite .",
    "since these works employed different gauges , the first one used the feynman gauge while the second and third ones relied on the fried - yennie gauge ( also called the yennie gauge ) , their mutual agreement provides an additional helpful check of the validity of the final result eq.([197 ] ) .",
    "eq.([197 ] ) provides a simple transparent estimate for the contribution of the e - line corrections .",
    "one point to be noted is a strong dependence of the result on the nuclear charge that makes the correction large for heavy atoms ; remember the discussion of this point in section [ intro ] .",
    "this behavior of the self - energy correction differs qualitatively from what we saw for the vacuum polarization in section [ vacuum and related ] , where the higher - orders in the @xmath342-expansion were found small .",
    "a notable feature in eq.([197 ] ) is the large coefficient @xmath354 on the right - hand side .",
    "_ naively _ one could expect this coefficient to be smaller , of the order of @xmath355 .",
    "it is interesting that a similar `` numerical enhancement '' occurs for the e - line radiative correction for the energy shift that is due to the finite nuclear size ( fns ) .",
    "this correction was examined analytically in refs.@xcite , and more recently in ref .",
    "the result can be written as    @xmath356    where the analytical expression was derived in @xcite .",
    "we see that indeed , the e - line corrections to the fns energy shift are governed by the large coefficient @xmath357 in ( [ fns ] ) , similar to ( [ 197 ] ) for the pnc amplitude .",
    "[ six ] examines this similarity in more detail .",
    "it shows data available for relative e - line corrections for the two problems mentioned above , namely for the pnc amplitude and fns energy shifts .",
    "the linear in @xmath22 approximations ( [ 197]),([fns ] ) ( that are valid for sufficiently small values of @xmath22 ) are compared in this figure with results that follow from numerical calculations of ref.@xcite .",
    "we observe a very close quantitative similarity between corrections to pnc and fns . in both cases the linear approximations ( [ 197 ] ) and ( [ fns ] )",
    "predict large negative corrections , which qualitatively agrees with results based on numerical calculations for heavy atoms .",
    "the numerical validity of the linear approximations seems to be limited by the region below @xmath358 , for higher @xmath22 they underestimate the effect .",
    "the cs atom lies on the border , where results of the small-@xmath22 and large-@xmath22 approaches agree reasonably well .",
    "numerical data used in eq.([ddd ] ) incorporates an error that increases for smaller values of @xmath22 , see tables iii and iv of @xcite . in order to reduce the impact of this error we can combine together eqs.([ddd]),([197 ] ) .",
    "one can approximate all nonlinear terms omitted in ( [ 197 ] ) by the simplest quadratic function and choose the corresponding coefficient to reproduce the results based on numerical data for very large @xmath22 , @xmath359 , where the numerical errors are small .",
    "this approach gives the following interpolating formula @xcite for the corrections to the pnc amplitude    @xmath360    fig .",
    "[ six ] shows that the data available for large - z and small - z regions is very smooth .",
    "therefore _ any _ reasonable interpolation would produce a pattern close to eq.([interp ] ) .",
    "we can be certain therefore that ( [ interp ] ) gives reliable numerical data . for the @xmath1cs atom eq.([interp ] )",
    "predicts @xmath361 ; compare this result with @xmath362 of ( [ 197 ] ) and @xmath363 that follows from eq.([ddd ] ) . of ref .",
    "a more accurate analysis demonstrates that this estimate is too conservative ; a more realistic one is @xmath364 taken above . ] for the tl atom eq.([interp ] ) predicts @xmath365 that agrees with the prediction of ( [ ddd ] ) discussed above ( as it should , since the data of @xcite incorporates only very small errors for heavy atoms ) .",
    "it should be noted that eq.([ddd ] ) does not rely on the perturbation theory in powers of @xmath342 , effectively including all nonlinear corrections .",
    "this makes it accurate even at large values of the nuclear charge .",
    "it should therefore be considered as a formula that provides a convenient short - cut presentation of the nonlinear result .",
    "a similar formula was suggested in @xcite to reconcile the data for the e - line corrections to the energy shifts due to fns for the @xmath20 state . the linear in @xmath22 term of eq.([fns ] ) and",
    "numerical data of @xcite available for heavy atoms can be interpolated by    @xmath366    fig .",
    "[ six ] shows that this interpolation is reliable .",
    "this implies that for relatively light atoms @xmath367 numerical results for the @xmath20 energy corrections should be amended by slightly larger values .",
    "an alternative method to include the nonlinear corrections was developed in refs .",
    "that relies on direct analytical calculations .",
    "this approach faces a difficulty because even in the next - to - leading order @xmath368 the calculations become complicated .",
    "ref.@xcite showed , however , that in this order there appears a large logarithmic factor that makes the correction proportional to @xmath369 .",
    "calculations with the logarithmic accuracy , when some constant is neglected , are much more feasible .",
    "the elegant result for the thus calculated second - order correction ( index 2 in the superscript ) was derived in @xcite    @xmath370    where @xmath371 $ ] .",
    "the final result of @xcite is given by the sum of the linear term eq.([197 ] ) and the second order correction eq.([mstlog ] ) .",
    "it is compared in fig . [ seven ] with predictions of eqs .",
    "( [ ddd ] ) and ( [ interp ] ) . for the sake of completeness",
    "the figure also shows the previous results of ref .",
    "for all values of the nuclear charges the results of @xcite are close to our results derived from eqs.([ddd ] ) and ( [ interp ] ) , as was emphasized in @xcite .",
    "recently milstein _ et al _ @xcite refined their arguments , demonstrating that the logarithmic factor similar to the one in eq.([mstlog ] ) exists in all higher order terms of the @xmath33-expansion .",
    "@xcite found the corresponding contribution of the higher - order terms numerically .",
    "this latest calculation , also shown in fig.[seven ] , is even closer to our results given by eqs.([ddd ] ) and ( [ interp ] ) .",
    "the deviation from ( [ interp ] ) is below @xmath372 for a wide range of atomic charges .",
    "@xcite claims their error to be of the order of @xmath373 ; our estimate for the accuracy of eq.([ddd ] ) , which limits the error at large @xmath22 , is a _ few _ percent , see section [ equality ] . within these errors",
    "the results of the two groups completely agree .",
    "the fact that the remaining discrepancy increases for heavy atoms indicates probably that it is due to terms of the @xmath33-expansion still unaccounted for in @xcite .",
    "overall , fig.[seven ] shows good agreement of the recent results obtained by the two groups using different approaches .",
    "the sharp contradiction that existed during the initial stages of this research ( compare the dashed - dotted line with the thick - dotted line ) makes the latest convergence even more satisfying and trustworthy .",
    "there is an interesting physical link between the chiral invariance identity of eq.([ddd ] ) and the perturbation theory approach of eqs.([197]),([mstlog ] ) .",
    "remember that in deriving eq.([final ] ) in the previous section we focused our attention at one stage of the consideration at small distances @xmath374 .",
    "the claim was that if this region is proved to comply with eq.([final ] ) , then the outer region @xmath375 would inevitably comply with it as well , see discussion after eq.([rr ] ) .",
    "a similar philosophy lies behind the logarithmic approximation in eq .",
    "( [ mstlog ] ) . the integration that leads to the logarithmic function in this equation",
    "is saturated at small distances .",
    "the omitted constant is related to larger distances , but it is of lesser importance and can , in the simplest approximation , be neglected .",
    "thus in both approaches the region of small distances proves to be the most important .",
    "this link between the chiral invariance identity and the perturbation theory shows that eq.([ddd ] ) should be valid when one restricts consideration to the logarithmic approximation .",
    "this means that the term @xmath376 should exist not only in the pnc problem , see eq.([mstlog ] ) , but in the fns problem for the @xmath20 and @xmath26 partial waves as well .",
    "eq.([ddd ] ) predicts a linear relation between the three coefficients of these three terms .",
    "ref.@xcite demonstrated that the three coefficients mentioned are all equal , in compliance with eq.([ddd ] ) .",
    "this fact can be considered either as a consequence of eq.([ddd ] ) , or , alternatively , as its independent verification , being fruitful either way .",
    "the picture of reliability presented above based on the complete accord of all available data for the self - energy corrections in atoms has recently been put to test _ again _ by milstein _",
    "et al_. they have claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite that for small values of the nuclear charge @xmath377 the self - energy corrections for the energy shift induced by the fns in the @xmath26 partial wave are positive and very large , being two orders of magnitude greater than anticipated previously for the hydrogen atom . for the @xmath378 state",
    "the proposed enhancement is even stronger , four orders of magnitude .",
    "this conclusion , if correct , could be related to the pnc problem for light elements through the equality of @xcite mentioned above that binds together the radiative corrections for the pnc and fns problems .",
    "it needs , however , to be pointed out that a questionable approach is applied in @xcite .",
    "it uses the _",
    "small_-momenta expansion for the vertex operator .",
    "when this technique is used for the short - range potential there arises a contradiction because the short - range potential needs _",
    "large _ momenta .",
    "attempts to use a similar line of arguments for calculations of radiative corrections have been made previously , but it was recognized that they strongly overestimate the effect , by orders of magnitude . a necessity to be very careful , to avoid using the small - momenta asymptotic dealing with the short - range potentials , was clearly stated long time ago by lepage _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "one is forced to presume therefore that conclusions of @xcite are not convincing ( probably they should be even called preliminary , if one uses the latter term as in ref.@xcite ) . fortunately , these results do not influence either the above mentioned good numerical agreement that was achieved for heavy atoms , or the analytical agreement between the two groups within the @xmath379-expansion that defines the pnc in light elements .",
    "discussions in this section are almost entirely devoted to analytical methods , the only exception was made for the numerical data available for corrections to the energy shifts due to the fns .",
    "the main reason for this is that direct numerical calculations for the self - energy corrections for the pnc amplitude have not yet been reported .",
    "presumably the difficulties in this approach are significant , though not being experts in this area we would not speculate on the details .",
    "we wish to mention , however , that developments in this direction are quite desirable due to several reasons .",
    "one of them , purely theoretical , has come into existence only recently .",
    "numerical studies can determine independently the accuracy of the chiral identity ( [ ddd ] ) .",
    "knowing the limitations of this relation in the pnc problem , one would be able to estimate the accuracy of other relations of this type that can be derived and used in similar problems in the future .",
    "summarizing , we discussed above two different methods for calculation of the self - energy corrections , one related to the chiral invariance identity ( [ ddd ] ) , the other one based on the @xmath33-expansion .",
    "they give close results proving that the self - energy corrections to the pnc amplitude are large and negative .",
    "most importantly , this fact brings the experimental data for the @xmath380 pnc amplitude in @xmath1cs into agreement with the standard model .",

    "we find @xmath384 for the cs atom and @xmath385 for pb , tl and bi .    let us discuss the implications of these results , first for the @xmath6 pnc amplitude in @xmath1cs .",
