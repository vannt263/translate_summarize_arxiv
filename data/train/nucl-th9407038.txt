    "pion photoproduction has a long history going back to the early 50 s  @xcite . in recent years",
    "the interest in this reaction has been revived as a result of new experimental facilities which allow more careful studies of this reaction over a much wider energy range , and the advent of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as a fundamental theory of strong interaction which should yield the internal structure of the nucleon .",
    "in particular the study of the reaction @xmath4 is motivated by : ( i )  the fact that this is the simplest nuclear system one can examine to understand the mechanism of pion photoproduction .",
    "furthermore the amplitude for this reaction can be used as input into the calculation of pion photoproduction off heavier nuclei  @xcite , with the expectation of gaining information about nuclear structure .",
    "( ii )  the recent interest in chiral symmetry  @xcite and its possible violation in this reaction  @xcite , which have raised questions regarding the role of unitarity in this reaction  @xcite , and the use of pion photoproduction to test chiral models of qcd , e.g.  chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "( iii )  the new facilities at cebaf , and other facilities which will open the way to examine the structure of the nucleon and the resonances observed in @xmath0 scattering and pion photoproduction .",
    "these results could shed light on the need to introduce quark - gluon degrees of freedom , and in particular determine the energy at which these new degrees of freedom become more important than the traditional meson - baryon degrees of freedom .",
    "in addition , this data could be used to test models of qcd .    to examine the structure of resonances observed in @xmath0 scattering using pion photoproduction",
    ", we need to include the important thresholds for all possible reactions at that resonance energy . to achieve this",
    "we may need to include in our formulation those unitarity cuts , and therefore thresholds , important for that resonance  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the incident photon will interact with the electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "charge and current distribution in the target , and to that extent it is essential to satisfy charge conservation or @xmath5 gauge invariance .",
    "the fact that the proton has an internal structure , that could be described in terms of quarks at short distances and mesons at large distances , suggests that these degrees of freedom should be taken into consideration in determining the electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "charge and current distribution .",
    "the meson degrees of freedom , which include nucleon dressing and the distortion of the final outgoing pion wave are part of the mechanism needed to include unitarity and therefore the proper thresholds .",
    "thus under ideal conditions one should satisfy both unitarity and @xmath5 gauge invariance in a consistent manner .",
    "in addition , the quark dynamics should be included in the determination of the charge and current distribution even though they do not contribute directly to any thresholds since the quarks are confined .",
    "historically , early calculations of pion photoproduction were made to satisfy unitarity by imposing the watson theorem  @xcite .",
    "this basically consisted of representing the final distortion in the @xmath0 channel by the on - shell pion - nucleon amplitude or @xmath0 phase shift . in this way",
    "the cross - section for pion photoproduction consisted of two parts , the born amplitude which included the interaction of the photon with the nucleon and meson currents ( see fig .  1 ) , and",
    "the on - shell @xmath0 amplitude which was included to satisfy two - body unitarity .",
    "the two ingredients were considered to be independent .",
    "thus for the born amplitude , the photon coupled to a nucleon with an internal structure represented by an on - mass - shell form factor extracted from elastic electron - proton scattering , while the pion coupling to a finite nucleon ( see fig .",
    "1 ) involved a @xmath6 form factor which was constrained by the @xmath5 gauge invariance to be the same as the e.m .",
    "form factor  @xcite . here",
    "we should note that there is no consistency between the @xmath6 form factor used and the e.m .",
    "form factor other than the overall gauge invariance of the born amplitude . on the other hand , the @xmath0 amplitude , which also has the @xmath7 form factor , was determined solely by the @xmath0 scattering data . in other words",
    "there was no consistency between the born amplitude for pion photoproduction and the @xmath0 amplitude that determined the dynamics of pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "more recently  @xcite , extensions of this procedure have been developed with considerable success , that extend the watson theorem by employing the off - shell @xmath0 amplitude generated by either a separable potential  @xcite or a chiral lagrangian  @xcite to determine the final distortion of the outgoing pion . even in these calculations",
    "no attempt has been made to have any consistency between the @xmath0 dynamics and the born amplitude for pion photoproduction .",
    "the present investigation is an attempt at a reformulation of pion photoproduction that satisfies both unitarity and @xmath5 gauge invariance .",
    "the @xmath0 dynamics required for unitarity will determine the charge and current distribution . in this way",
    "we maintain consistency between the pion dynamics and the requirement of e.m .",
    "gauge invariance .    to include gauge invariance and the dynamics that determine the underlying structure of the nucleon",
    ", we need to gauge the lagrangian for the underlying strong interaction dynamics .",
    "ideally this means we need to start from the qcd lagrangian and include the e.m .  interaction .",
    "however at this stage we have no practical procedure for projecting meson - baryon degrees of freedom without resorting to models of qcd .",
    "for example , if we assume that the cloudy bag model ( cbm )  @xcite determines the dynamics of the quarks and pions , then we should first gauge the cbm lagrangian  @xcite to include the e.m .  interaction . to substitute the quark degrees of freedom by the baryonic degrees of freedom ,",
    "we need to take the second step of implementing the procedure adopted in the cbm by effectively integrating out the quark degrees of freedom .",
    "this two step process of getting an effective meson - baryon lagrangian that includes the electromagnetic and meson interaction consistently , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] . unfortunately , to get the correct current for the coupling of the photon to the baryon , we need to construct , in the cbm , a state that is an eigenstate of the total four - momentum that can be boosted from one inertial frame to another  @xcite .",
    "this in practice is not possible in a bag model because the bag boundary condition can not be simply boosted .",
    "however , this procedure could be followed in other chiral soliton models  @xcite with some difficulty , or we can use a model such as the njl lagrangian  @xcite or the global colour model ( gcm )  @xcite which can in principle give a translationally invariant state  @xcite .",
    "the resultant lagrangian would have gauge invariance , and we could then proceed to implement unitarity , taking as a starting point the lagrangian in the space of baryons , mesons and photons .",
    "the effect of quarks would be to have form factors for all vertices , but now we would have a self - consistency between the different form factors in the lagrangian .",
    "in particular , the form factor associated with the nucleon e.m .",
    "current and the form factor in the @xmath6 vertex would be consistent .",
    "furthermore , this @xmath7 form factor goes into the dynamics that generates the @xmath0 interaction . since the quarks are confined , and therefore do not contribute to unitarity , an alternative procedure that would satisfy gauge invariance and unitarity , see fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , would be to integrate the quark degrees of freedom in favour of baryon degrees of freedom . in this case",
    ", we would have form factors associated with the meson - baryon lagrangian , and these form factors are related to the quark structure of the nucleon .",
    "we then can implement ohta s  @xcite approach of minimal e.m .",
    "coupling to gauge the resultant lagrangian with form factors .",
    "the contribution to the nucleon propagator and @xmath6 form factor from meson dressing will then be included explicitly , while maintaining both unitarity and gauge invariance .    in sec .",
    "[ sec.2 ] we employ ohta s minimum electromagnetic coupling to generate a lagrangian that corresponds to a nucleon with internal structure and that is gauge invariant . at this stage",
    "we will assume that this internal structure is due to quark degrees of freedom .",
    "furthermore , this lagrangian in lowest order gives a photoproduction amplitude that is gauge invariant .",
    "this is basically a summary of ohta s results , and sets the stage for the next step of including the contribution to unitarity from the pionic degrees of freedom .",
    "this will be detailed in sec .",
    "[ sec.3 ] where we derive a set of coupled integral equations for both @xmath0 elastic scattering and @xmath8 .",
    "since the threshold energies for @xmath0 scattering and @xmath9 are the same , we include both of these thresholds in our coupled channel formulation .",
    "to establish the gauge invariance of the photoproduction amplitude resulting from the coupled channel approach , we proceed in sec .",
    "[ sec.4 ] to make use of the ward - takahashi  @xcite identities and the procedure proposed by kazes  @xcite to derive the amplitude for this reaction from the one pion irreducible @xmath6 three - point function derived in sec .",
    "[ sec.3 ] .",
    "we then show in sec .",
    "[ sec.5 ] that the amplitude resulting from the solution of the coupled channel is in fact identical to that derived from the application of the ward - takahashi identities . in this way",
    "we establish that the solution of the coupled channels problem satisfies both unitarity and gauge invariance . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec.6 ] we present some concluding remarks .",
    "our main motivation in the present investigation is to set up a unitary and gauge invariant formulation of pion photoproduction .",
    "since the quarks and gluons are confined , they do not contribute to unitarity , and we can include this sub - structure by introducing form factors into our lagrangian . in other words",
    "we can consider a lagrangian for the system of nucleons and pions as @xmath10 the lagrangians for the baryon and meson with internal structure are taken to be  @xcite    [ eq:2.2 ] @xmath11\\psi(x )                                      \\label{eq:2.2a}\\ ] ] @xmath12    where the form factors @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are to be determined from the underlying quark - gluon structure , e.g.  we could write the corresponding propagators for the nucleon and pion as    [ eq:2.3 ] @xmath16^{-1 }      \\label{eq:2.3a}\\ ] ] @xmath17^{-1}\\ ,    \\label{eq:2.3b}\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 and @xmath19 could be written in terms of their quark structure as illustrated in fig .  [ fig.3 ] .",
    "it should be pointed out at this stage that the qcd model used in evaluating the the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] should not give rise to unitarity cuts since the quarks are confined .",
    "the mass shifts in both the baryon and the meson propagators can then be written in terms of the functions in the lagrangian , e.g.  by taking @xmath20 we can write the fourier transform of the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath22 as @xmath23 and @xmath24 . thus the nucleon propagator is given as @xmath25 the conditions that this propagator have a simple pole at the nucleon mass , @xmath26 , and the residue at this pole be one , impose the following conditions on the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 , i.e.    [ eq:2.5 ] @xmath29 and @xmath30 with @xmath31    in a similar manner we can determine @xmath32 in terms of @xmath19 with the requirement that the pion propagator has a pole at @xmath33 with unit residue . in this way the underlying quark - gluon degrees of freedom have been included , and the gauging of these propagators will give us the coupling of the photon to the nucleon and the pion that have internal structure . at this stage we should point out that any pionic dressing of the nucleon will shift the mass @xmath26 , and to that extent the nucleon mass in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.5 ] ) may need to be considered as the bare nucleon mass .",
    "this will also apply to the pion mass , if it is to get any further dressing .",
    "the interaction terms in the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2.1 ] ) can be written as @xmath34 here again the vertex function @xmath35 could be determined from an underlying qcd model , e.g.  the cbm gives the @xmath6 form factor in terms of the bag radius and the wave function of the quark in the bag .",
    "the non - locality in this lagrangian can be turned into momentum dependence as demonstrated by ohta  @xcite .",
    "this in turn allows us to gauge the lagrangian using the minimal substitution rule . to achieve this",
    "we follow ohta s  @xcite procedure of converting the momenta into operators , i.e.  @xmath36 , and then introducing the minimal substitution rule @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the charge operator given in terms of the nucleon isospin operator by @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the photon field .",
    "thus for the nucleon propagator we have , using this procedure , @xmath41 where after writing the propagator in terms of the form factors @xmath28 and @xmath27 , we have @xmath42   \\nonumber   \\\\             & & \\quad -mh\\left((\\hat{p}-qa)^{2}\\right ) \\ .     \\label{eq:2.10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly the presence of the photon field in the form factors @xmath13 and @xmath14 does not allow a simple determination of the @xmath43 vertex .",
    "as such , the photon field factors must be extracted from @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to this end , it is assumed that there exists a taylor series expansion for both @xmath13 and @xmath14 of the form @xmath44 restricting our discussion to @xmath13 only and applying the minimal substitution to equation  ( [ eq:2.11 ] ) gives @xmath45 since the charge operator @xmath38 , is directly proportional to the electromagnetic coupling constant @xmath46 , eq .",

    "[ fig.4 ] , we can use the following substitution @xmath50 proposed by ohta  @xcite to reduce equation  ( [ eq:2.13 ] ) to the form @xmath51 this is the relation governing how @xmath13 behaves under gauging ; there is a corresponding relation for @xmath14 .    with these results in hand , equation  ( [ eq:2.9 ] ) ,",

    "in a similar manner we can proceed to gauge the pion propagator @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the pion momentum operator and @xmath19 contains terms which dress the pion in terms of its quark - gluon content , e.g.  @xmath62 . defining @xmath63 as the pion charge operator",

    "thus we have that @xmath297 and in this way we have established the fact that the solution of the coupled integral equation , eq .",

    "the second term , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.8 ] , is required to maintain gauge invariance at the operator level for @xmath155 , and results from including the @xmath1 channel into our integral equations .",
    "this inclusion of the @xmath1 channel effectively allows us to couple the photon not only to the initial nucleon in the @xmath137 vertex , but also to the nucleon in the final state . in this way we have coupled the nucleon to every propagator and vertex in the three - point green s function for @xmath301",
    "to employ pion photoproduction at medium energies to examine nucleon structure and in particular the resonances observed in @xmath0 scattering , we need a theory that incorporates charged current conservation and the conservation of probability , i.e.  gauge invariance and unitarity .",
    "if in addition we would like to test current models of qcd based on quark - gluon degrees of freedom , we need to include form factors in which we have consistency between the @xmath6 and @xmath43 form factors resulting from qcd . in the present investigation",
    ", we considered a lagrangian written in terms of the meson - baryon degrees of freedom .",
    "this lagrangian has form factors which in principle could be derived from a qcd model .",
    "we then gauged this lagrangian with the help of the procedure proposed by ohta  @xcite .",
    "this gauging procedure could have been circumvented had we considered a specific qcd model . however , to avoid the problem of working within a specific model , we chose to maintain generality and restrict our gauging to the approach proposed by ohta .    within the framework of this lagrangian which includes not only the meson - baryon degrees of freedom but also the coupling of the photon to these degrees of freedom",
    ", we derived a set of coupled integral equations that satisfy two - particle unitarity .",
    "this was achieved by exposing the @xmath0 , @xmath95 and @xmath302 thresholds following the analysis of taylor  @xcite . to prove that the solution of these coupled equations is also gauge invariant , we employed the ward - takahashi identities , derived for the basic terms in the lagrangian , to gauge the one particle irreducible three point function for the process @xmath137 . since we demanded that our amplitude satisfy _ only _ two - body unitarity",
    ", we assumed that the final nucleon propagator in the @xmath137 green s function did not have any pionic dressing , and the initial nucleon propagator had the minimal dressing to include the @xmath0 threshold , while the @xmath6 vertex in the three - point function was one - particle irreducible .",
    "this gauging procedure gave us an amplitude that is identical to that resulting from a solution of coupled integral equations .",
    "we found it essential that we include the @xmath1 threshold into our coupled integral equation .",
    "the need for the inclusion of the @xmath1 threshold to satisfy gauge invariance at the operator level , raises some questions regarding the application of watson s theorem  @xcite or its off - shell modification  @xcite to unitarise the gauge invariant born term represented in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , and to maintain gauge invariance in the final result .",
    "in fact when we cast our amplitude into a form of watson s theorem , i.e.  a distorted wave in the @xmath0 channel , we found that we had an additional term that has not been included in most calculations in the past .",
    "these additional terms are required in order to preserve gauge invariance of the photoproduction amplitude at the operator level .",
    "we are presently considering a simple model to determine the contribution of these additional terms required for maintaining gauge invariance and unitarity in the final amplitude .",

    "one of the authors ( ira ) would like to thank professor j. speth and the hospitality of ikp at forschungszentrum jlich , where part of this work was done .",
    "if we include the @xmath94 and @xmath93 exchange @xmath0 potential into our basic lagrangian , then we have introduced @xmath303 and @xmath304 vertices into the theory and these in turn will contribute to pionic dressing . for the present , since we have not specified the @xmath0 interaction , we will ignore the dressing of the pion propagator ."
