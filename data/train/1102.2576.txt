    "the advent of graphene @xcite opened a door for exploration of new phenomena in two - dimensional dirac - like condensed matter systems .",
    "one of the intriguing questions is of superconducting correlations of electrons on the honeycomb lattice system .",
    "superconductivity has been induced in short graphene samples through proximity effect with superconducting contacts @xcite .",
    "this indicates that cooper pairs can propagate coherently in graphene . in principle superconductivity on the graphene honeycomb lattice",
    "can be induced by short - range attractive interactions and explorations of allowed possibilities were given in refs .",
    "@xcite . among the most interesting",
    "is the so - called @xmath3 superconducting instability introduced in ref .",
    "it would be supported by the most natural nearest - neighbor attractive interaction and have distinct features of the dirac electrons .",
    "later it was showed @xcite , by a restricted ( low - energy ) analysis , that this state may be less energetically favorable with respect to kekule - like order parameter arrangements .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath4 instability seems , though an exotic state , a very attractive possibility because of its underlying symmetry of the order parameter , the same as for pfaffian quantum hall state @xcite or @xmath3 spinless superconductor @xcite .",
    "the later systems support non - abelian statistics , which is at the heart of the idea of the topological computing @xcite .",
    "there is an important difference between these states and the proposed graphene state",
    ". the superconducting instability in graphene does not break time - reversal symmetry and those systems do .",
    "due to the valley degeneracy we effectively have two @xmath5 order parameters and that requires additional understanding of intertwined correlations and underlying symmetries .",
    "one way , just as in the pfaffian state @xcite , is to look for the ground state wave function and recognize the structures and symmetries .    in this paper , in the first part , we will find the effective ( long - distance ) expression for the ground state wave function of the @xmath3 spin - singlet instability described in ref . and display pertinent symmetries in this case .",
    "also a spinless case will be discussed .",
    "we will use the bcs mean - field formalism . in the following section",
    "we will set up the bcs formalism , solve the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations and find the expression for the ground state wave functions .",
    "the last section of the first part is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the second part of the paper is devoted to the @xmath6 superconductivity on the bilayer honeycomb lattice .",
    "we refer reader to this part of the paper for an introduction .",
    "the hamiltonian for free electrons on the honeycomb lattice is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hopping energy between nearest neighbor c ( carbon ) atoms , @xmath9 is the on - site annihilation ( creation ) operator for electrons in the sublattice a with spin @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for sublattice b , @xmath12 is the on - site number operator , and @xmath13 is the graphene chemical potential .",

    "the natural eigenstates of chirality appeared in our expressions .",
    "for example @xmath71 represents spinor : @xmath72,\\label{spinor}\\ ] ] which is the eigenstate of the chirality operator @xmath73 , defined with @xmath74 pauli matrices , i.e. the pseudospin ( due to two sublattices ) is along the momentum vector .",
    "the state @xmath75 represents the same spinor because of the interchanged roles of sublattices in the @xmath76 point . to see this in more details",
    "we would like to remind the reader that instead of the dirac free electron representation by the spinor @xmath77 and the chirality operator is defined as @xmath78,\\label{chiop}\\ ] ] in the bdg formalism we work with @xmath79 note the reversed order of sublattices and the change of the sign of the momentum @xmath47 near @xmath76 point in the bdg formalism with respect to the free one .",
    "thus the lower @xmath80 matrix on the diagonal of the hamiltonian matrix in the free dirac case can be read off from : @xmath81 \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } - \\mu & - v_f k^ * \\\\                          - v_f k &   - \\mu \\end{array } \\right ] \\left[\\begin{array}{c }   b_{\\vec{k}_{- } + \\vec{k } , \\sigma}\\\\ a_{\\vec{k}_{- } + \\vec{k } , \\sigma } \\end{array } \\right],\\label{drep}\\ ] ] i.e. it is equal to @xmath82 .",
    "note that if we change the sign of @xmath47 vector in eq.([drep ] ) i.e. @xmath83 the off - diagonal elements in the matrix will change the sign , so that in this basis in the free representation the chirality operator will not have minus sign in the lower right entry of the matrix representation in eq.([chiop ] )",
    ". therefore @xmath84 represents the same spinor ( up to a phase factor ) as in eq.([spinor ] ) and the same chirality eigenstate ( with positive eigenvalue ) as we pointed out earlier .",
    "nevertheless in the bogoliubov representation we still have @xmath85 \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\mu & - v_f k^ * \\\\                          - v_f k &    \\mu \\end{array } \\right ] \\left[\\begin{array}{c }   a_{- \\downarrow}^{+}\\\\ b_{- \\downarrow}^{+ } \\end{array } \\right],\\ ] ] i.e. the matrix is @xmath86 , and the representation of the chirality operator stays the same as in eq.([chiop ] ) .",
    "we will use this fact later . on the other hand the combinations in eqs .",
    "( [ beta1 ] ) and ( [ beta2 ] ) : @xmath87 and @xmath88 have the pseudospin vector in the opposite direction of the momentum vector @xmath47 .",
    "it is thus natural to introduce the following notation : @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 denote the chirality i.e. whether the pseudospin vector is along or in the opposite direction with respect to the @xmath47 vector , respectively .",
    "we have to note that these electron operators are defined up to a phase factor , most importantly @xmath92 phase .",
    "this degree of freedom should not influence the physics , but we chose the definitions so that later the symmetry under exchange of particles in the ground state wave function is transparent .",
    "the @xmath50 and @xmath93 sectors are obviously decoupled in the bogoliubov description and we can concentrate and closely examine the @xmath50 sector first .",
    "furthermore we do not have to consider @xmath76 point separately as the symmetry considerations tell us that the bdg equations around this point will induce the coupling or states of an electron around @xmath94 point with @xmath95 projection of spin and those around @xmath76 point with @xmath96 projection of spin .",
    "thus it suffices to consider @xmath50 sector first ( with @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) and then use the symmetry arguments , more precisely antisymmetry under real spin exchange to recover the whole ground state wave function .",
    "we can rewrite @xmath50 s in the following form , @xmath99 we should demand @xmath100 and @xmath101 , for any @xmath102 , if @xmath103 is to represent the ground state vector .",
    "that implies that in the @xmath50 sector of @xmath94 point we have the following contribution to the ground state , @xmath104 where @xmath105 denotes the vacuum .",
    "this state is annihilated with both , @xmath106 and @xmath107 the symmetry arguments demand that we should get a similar expression considering bdg equations at @xmath76 point .",
    "if we denote by @xmath108 , the ground state vector in the @xmath50 sector should look like : @xmath109 + \\frac{g_{\\alpha}^{2}(k)}{2 } [ c_{+ \\uparrow v}^{\\dagger } c_{- \\downarrow v}^{\\dagger } + c_{- \\uparrow v}^{\\dagger } c_{+ \\downarrow v}^{\\dagger}]^{2}\\}|0\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ = & & \\exp\\ { \\sum_{k } g_{\\alpha}(k ) [ c_{+ \\uparrow v}^{\\dagger } c_{- \\downarrow v}^{\\dagger } + c_{- \\uparrow v}^{\\dagger } c_{+ \\downarrow v}^{\\dagger}]\\}|0\\rangle\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we can identify @xmath110 to represent a fourier transform of the wave function of a cooper pair of electrons , which is a spin - singlet with respect to spin degree of freedom and a triplet state ( symmetric under exchange ) with respect to valley @xmath111 degree of freedom . if we defined differently our electron operators there would be possibility for @xmath110 to acquire the phase factor @xmath92 , which would make the identification of the antisymmetry under exchange harder .    taking into account the @xmath93 sector ( with the chirality in the opposite direction of the momentum : @xmath91 ) the complete ground state vector is @xmath112 + \\sum_{k } g_{\\beta}(k ) [ c_{+ \\uparrow w}^{\\dagger } c_{- \\downarrow w}^{\\dagger } + c_{- \\uparrow w}^{\\dagger } c_{+ \\downarrow w}^{\\dagger}]\\}|0\\rangle , \\label{gsv}\\ ] ] where @xmath113 using the long - distance ( low - momentum ) expansions for @xmath114 and @xmath115 , for finite @xmath13 , @xmath116 we find the long - distance behavior of the pair wave function to be @xmath117",
    "i.e. we have a case for a weak pairing @xcite . as emphasized in ref .",
    "the term weak pairing does not mean also weak coupling , it stands for a phase with an unusual large spread of the cooper pairs . on the other hand for @xmath57",
    "we have that @xmath110 and @xmath118 are two constants and the cooper pairs are localized on a short scale @xmath119 in the graphene system at the neutrality point .",
    "thus for @xmath57 we have a case for a strong pairing .",
    "the ground state vector ( wave function ) in eq.([gsv ] ) displays two kinds of cooper pairs , each antisymmetric under combined exchange of ( a ) orbital , ( b ) valley ( @xmath120 ) , and ( c ) spin @xmath121 degree of freedom .",
    "two kinds of cooper pairs stem from the chirality ( sublattice ) degree of freedom intimately connected with the dirac - nature of the electron with both , particles and holes .",
    "they both , particles ( with positive chirality @xmath90 at @xmath94 ) and holes ( with negative chirality @xmath91 at @xmath94 ) , constitute cooper pairs , which are symmetric under @xmath122 transformation .    in the long distance limit",
    "we recover the form of the wave function of ordinary @xmath123-wave superconductor as given in ref .",
    ", though with more , two - component , degrees of freedom . the cooper pair wave function is antisymmetric under spin exchange and symmetric under exchange of valley ( @xmath120 ) , sublattice @xmath124 , and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "next we will discuss the spin - triplet case , more precisely we will assume that the system is spin - polarized and not consider spin in the following",
    ". therefore fermions are spinless just like in the pfaffian case , but they live on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we will assume @xmath125 .",
    "in this case the bogoliubov problem in eq.([hbcs ] ) for the spin - singlet pairing transforms into a similar one with @xmath126 and @xmath127 , and the matrix @xmath128 becomes as follows @xmath129.\\ ] ] around the @xmath94 point we have @xmath130,\\ ] ] where @xmath131 as before .",
    "the problem around the @xmath76 point is a copy of the problem around the @xmath94 point .",

    "the eigenstates of the bogoliubov problem do not have to be the eigenstates of chirality .",

    "depending on our definitions for @xmath146 s two degrees of freedom can exchange the symmetry properties .",
    "we find again the weak pairing @xmath147 behavior in the orbital part .",
    "we derived the ground state wave functions for the superconductivity on the honeycomb lattice induced by nearest - neighbor attractive interactions and with order parameter independent of the direction to any of the nearest neighbors . although the order parameter in momentum space has the @xmath148 form in a low effective description the cooper pair wave function behaves as @xmath123-wave ( with no angular dependence ) and decays as @xmath149 .",
    "other ( discrete ) degrees of freedom combine to make the cooper pair antisymmetric under exchange . at the point of the transition , @xmath150 , in the spin - singlet case",
    "a strong pairing ( of the order of lattice spacing ) occurs .",
    "topological superconductors in a strict sense or what we also call non - trivial topological superconductors have odd number of majorana modes moving in each direction on the edge of such a superconductor @xcite . in the case of trivial topological superconductors we have",
    "even number of majorana modes i.e. by combining them in pairs we can talk about dirac fermions on their edge .",
    "@xmath123-wave superconductor in two dimensions is always topological in the sense that it has a gap in its bulk and non - trivial degeneracy of the ground state on the torus ( equal to four ) @xcite .",
    "we have to use one bose field ( one dirac fermion ) to describe the edge of such a system @xcite . on the other hand",
    "if we combine two @xmath36-wave superconductors , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 orbital symmetry , and each of the two corresponds to one let s say definite projection of spin we have the case for a non - trivial topological superconductor",
    ". in that case on the edge live two majorana modes that are moving in opposite directions and each is associated with different projection of electron spin .",
    "this represents a ",
    "helical \" edge where we have a pair of edge majorana modes ( moving in opposite directions ) that are connected with a time - reversal operation .",
    "this is the simplest topological",
    "superconductor we can imagine in two dimensions and has yet to be realized and detected in experiments . in three dimensions",
    "a realization of topological superconductor is he@xmath0 b - phase @xcite .    on the other hand the honeycomb lattice ,",
    "nowadays very much connected with the research on graphene , is a playing ground for various , among others topological , phases .",
    "the first topological insulator was introduced on the honeycomb lattice with a special interaction @xcite . while considering possibilities for superconducting instabilities on the honeycomb lattice and graphene in ref .",
    ", a phase was proposed with two @xmath36-wave order parameters ( each near two effective descriptions in @xmath47-space i.e. two valleys ) . though one might expect that , while considering triplet pairing i.e. if we suppress spin , this would lead to a non - trivial topological superconductor with a pair of majorana modes ,",
    "this is not the case as we demonstrated in the first part of the paper ( ref . ) .",
    "we found that the ground state wave function is antisymmetric with respect to the valley degree of freedom and that the orbital part of the cooper pair is with no angular dependence i.e. a @xmath123-wave . as we emphasized earlier in the case of @xmath123-wave",
    "we expect one dirac fermion per degree of freedom on the edge i.e. no non - trivial behavior .",
    "in this paper we will derive ground state wave functions for some superconducting instabilities that may emerge due attractive interactions on a two layer system in which each layer represents a honeycomb lattice .",
    "the two lattices are stacked as in the bilayer graphene i.e. in the way of bernal stacking . as in the bilayer graphene",
    ", we expect that the pseudospin vector connected with sublattice degrees of freedom will not follow the momentum vector in a parallel or antiparallel fashion , like on ordinary honeycomb lattice or graphene , but rotate for a whole angle as a result of a rotation of the momentum vector for a half an angle .",
    "this feature of free electrons on the bilayer honeycomb lattice will reflect in the description of cooper pairs when attractive interactions are introduced .",
    "the explicit ground state wave functions and cooper pair structure will help us to see more closely the nature of pairing in this system . we will find the @xmath36-wave angular dependence in the orbital part .    in the following section , we will formulate bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equatons for this system . in the next section",
    "the explicit solutions with corresponding ground state wave functions will be given in the case of ( a ) spin - singlet and ( b ) spinless ( spin - triplet ) pairing .",
    "then we will examine whether these systems are truly gapped in the bulk , and , in the spin - singlet case , its edge spectrum .",
    "the last section is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "the hamiltonian for free electrons on two honeycomb lattices , which are bernal stacked , is @xmath151 the index @xmath152 denotes the layer index . in fig .",

    "as the reader may have noticed we did not include the direct hopping between the atoms of b1 and b2 sublattice .",
    "this inclusion is required when we model bilayer graphene @xcite , but even there for realistic parameters this does not influence the physics at high electron momenta or strong magnetic fields @xcite .",

    "is projected onto b1 and b2 sublattice .",
    "if the interactions are not too strong they can be simply added to this low - energy subspace .",

    ". we may then define their superpositions , @xmath223 then we can rewrite bogoliubov operators as : @xmath224 with @xmath225 , and find that the wave function , @xmath226 , @xmath227 is annihilated by quasiparticle annihilation operators , @xmath228 , and by quasihole creation operators , @xmath229 .",
    "therefore the new ground state is @xmath230 where we explicitly introduced the sector that couples momenta around @xmath94 with spin @xmath95 and momenta around @xmath76 with spin @xmath96 by enforcing the explicit spin - singlet pairing which we introduced at the beginning .    from the structure of the ground state wave function for spin - singlet pairing in eq.([gs1 ] )",
    "we find that electrons pair between @xmath94 and @xmath76 point have the same pseudospin and therefore we have two distinct cooper pairings for two orthogonal pseudospin states , which we denoted by @xmath231 and @xmath232 .",
    "each pair has a @xmath36-wave pairing in the orbital part and , as we work with a time - reversal invariant system , two distinct cooper pairings are accompanied by two distinct , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , symmetries in the orbital part .",
    "each cooper pair is antisymmetric under spin exchange , valley exchange , and exchange in the orbital part and symmetric under sublattice ( pseudospin ) exchange .",
    "therefore the ground state wave function in eq.([gs1 ] ) describes a cooper - paired collection of fermions -electrons on the bilayer honeycomb lattice with unconventional @xmath36-wave pairing .",
    "the non - trivial ( non-@xmath123-wave ) pairing can not be eliminated with a gauge transformation . to preserve the form of the free part of the hamiltonian",

    "next we will discuss the spinless case .",
    "we will assume that all electron spins are polarized and that @xmath239 .",
    "in this case the bogoliubov problem in eq.([hbcs2 ] ) for the spin - singlet pairing transforms into a similar one with @xmath240 and @xmath241 and the matrix @xmath208 becomes as follows , @xmath242.\\ ] ] the problem around the @xmath76 point is a copy of the problem around @xmath94 .",

    "we have two kinds of cooper pairs with underlying @xmath251 and @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "in ref . the case of spin - singlet pairing in the monolayer was thoroughly discussed .",
    "a topological phase structure was described with four ( due to valley and spin ) dirac edge modes .",
    "this is consistent with our previous calculations of the ground state wave function that has explicit @xmath123-wave dependence @xmath252 for @xmath253 ( chemical potential ) .",
    "here we extended ground state calculations to the spin - singlet and spin - triplet case of the bilayer .",
    "it is appropriate to ask the question raised in ref . for spin - singlet and spin - triplet monolayer case : are these phases truly gapped or there are nodes for some @xmath102 s in the bulk spectrum ? in the same reference",
    "it was found that in the spin - triplet case , as opposed to the spin - singlet case , there are nodes in @xmath102 space at which gap is equal to zero .",
    "we will find a similar situation in the bilayer case , except that in the case of spin - singlet pairing there is a critical value for chemical potential above which we have a truly gapped - topological phase .",
    "( the triplet case just as in the monolayer analysis in ref . has nodes in the bulk spectrum . )",
    "it is not hard , by repeating the approach of ref .",

    "we look for the zeros of bogoliubov quasiparticle energies , expressed in the low @xmath102 limit in eq.([e1 ] ) and eq.([e2 ] ) , when @xmath259 . with no low momentum limit , from eq.([mat ] ) , their expressions are , @xmath260}},\\ ] ] where we used shorthand notation taking @xmath261 , and @xmath262 and @xmath263 correspond to the spin - singlet and spin - triplet case respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath264 is small with respect to @xmath13 so that possible nodes can be only near fermi surface defined by @xmath265 .",
    "equating @xmath262 and @xmath263 to zero is equivalent to the following condition , @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the phase of @xmath268 - complex number in general . if we assume that we work with @xmath102 s near fermi surface we have approximately @xmath269 where @xmath270 is defined by @xmath271 as a small depature from the fermi surface value .",
    "therefore we can approximate that for possible nodes near fermi surface in the case of spin - singlet pairing @xmath268 is imaginary i.e. @xmath272 and in the case of spin - triplet pairing @xmath268 is real i.e. @xmath273 .",
    "it is not hard to find nodes in the spin - triplet case . from the definition ,",
    "@xmath274 we can recognize that possible positions of nodes can be restricted to @xmath275 , because in that case @xmath268 takes real values ; @xmath276 . then in our approximation from eq.([cond ] ) and definition @xmath277 we have @xmath278 and that with @xmath275 defines a position of a single node .",
    "therefore the existence of this node ( and other related by symmetry ) tell us that this phase is likely to be gapless even in the bulk and can not represent a topological phase .    in the spin - singlet case , if we rescale the momentum @xmath279 as @xmath280 in eq.([def ] ) , the condition that @xmath268 is purely imaginary demands that @xmath281 then @xmath282 expressed differently as @xmath283 this leads to the conclusion that for large enough @xmath284 i.e. chemical potential this equation does not have a solution for @xmath285 .",
    "we find that for @xmath286 no solution exists .",
    "therefore for large enough chemical potential we can have a spin - singlet topological phase i.e. a phase with no gapless bulk excitations .      to further examine the topological nature of the spin - singlet phase we will derive its edge modes . with respect to the lattice structure we will consider a particular geometry where the system , defined on a half - plane , has the edge at @xmath287 .",
    "we remind the reader that we use the convention in which @xmath120 vectors are along @xmath288 axis .",
    "this choice of boundary corresponds to so - called armchair boundary condition for which we require that the solutions of bdg equations vanish at @xmath287 .",
    "we will consider bdg equations in the low @xmath102 limit around @xmath120 points , neglect terms quadratic in @xmath289 , and employ the substitution @xmath290 to get their form in the real space ; due to the symmetry of the problem we seek solutions in the form @xmath291 and keep the @xmath279 dependence .",
    "the expression for bdg matrix at momentum @xmath292 is @xmath293,\\ ] ] and at momentum @xmath294 , @xmath295,\\ ] ] and we immediately see a reduction of the problem to four sets of equations with the substitution @xmath290 . if we denote by @xmath296 a form of a solution , where we used @xmath96 and @xmath95 to denote in a shorthand notation _",
    "( compare with eq.([gensol ] ) where the same symbols were used for real spin ) , we have four sets of equations of similar form . for example , one set at @xmath60 point is : @xmath297 just as argued in ref . in the case of a simple @xmath36-wave superconductor ,",
    "when @xmath298 and @xmath299 we have a zero mode , @xmath300 .",
    "the difference here is that @xmath301 and @xmath302 carry opposite valley indexes and we can not construct majorana bogoliubov quasiparticle with them , but only a dirac one . for @xmath303 we find a chiral ( unidirectional ) mode : @xmath304 . considering analogous equation for @xmath305 and @xmath302 at @xmath76 point we get an additional solution with the same chirality ( the same direction of @xmath279 ) , but these two solutions enter the boundary condition which requires that @xmath306 vanishes at the boundary .",
    "therefore one solution with @xmath307 is @xmath308 where @xmath309 . the other , with @xmath310 and @xmath311",
    ", we find in analogous way .",
    "therefore , we find , as expected from the ground state wave function in eq.([gs1 ] ) , two ( dirac ) solutions with opposite directions of motion along the edge that carry opposite pseudospin .",
    "in addition , due to the spin degree of freedom we expect doubling of modes i.e. in total two dirac modes in each direction .",
    "we do not have to go into a discussion of topological invariants to recognize that ground states for spin - singlet pairing , eq .",
    "( [ gs1 ] ) , and for spin - triplet pairing , eq.([gs2 ] ) , may represent ground states of trivial topological superconductors ; spin and valley degree of freedom induce the doubling of majorana modes that may follow @xcite from @xmath36-wave pairing in the orbital part .",
    "nevertheless these models of superconductors are interesting in their own right due to the presence of the @xmath36-wave pairings in the orbital part . in the case of spin - singlet pairing",
    "we found that there are no gapless bulk excitations for large enough chemical potential and this phase can represent a trivial topological superconductor .    in deriving ground state wave functions , in the spin - singlet and spin - triplet case",
    ", we assumed validity of small @xmath102 expansion around @xmath312 . in a strict sense",
    "this requires that @xmath313 is in the same neighborhood where we can approximate dispersion relations i.e. either effective hopping ( fermi velocity ) is large or chemical potential is small .",
    "we also allowed the possibility that minima or even nodes ( in the spin - triplet case ) in the spectra of the superconductors can be away from @xmath312 , around @xmath313 . in the cases of the trivial topological superconductors , on the monolayer and bilayer honeycomb lattice , this seems completely justified in the view of their edge spectrum ( see also @xcite ) . in the cases of gapless spin - triplet superconductors derived ground state wave functions",
    ", though we are inclined to associate them with topological phases , may describe these critical states @xcite .",
    "we find that only if we apply bias to the bilayer larger than its chemical potential we can not apply the bdg program around @xmath312 in the way we described in the paper .",
    "( we remind the reader that with the bias the energy minima of the noninteracting problem shift from @xmath312 at @xmath172 points to nonzero @xmath102 s . )    the attractive interactions that we need for the realization of the paired ground states and phases may well be within the reach of future experiments . in the case of a single honeycomb lattice the interactions may be induced by chemically doping the graphene via metal coating @xcite or trapping fermionic atoms in a honeycomb optical lattice @xcite .    to conclude , in the second part of this paper we derived ground state wave functions for the superconductivity on the bilayer honeycomb lattice ( with strong interlayer coupling ) induced by attractive interactions between sites that participate in a low - energy description .",
    "as is well - known , without these interactions , free electrons are described by a dirac equation with a quadratic dispersion .",
    "this unusual feature , similarly to @xmath314he - b phase , leads to the description with two kinds of cooper pairs , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 pairing , in the presence of the attractive interactions .",
    "this is expressed in eq.([gs1 ] ) in the case of the spin - singlet pairing . due to the spin degree of freedom",
    "we find doubling of two chiral dirac modes with opposite pseudospin on the edge of this spin - singlet superconductor - a trivial topological superconductor .",
