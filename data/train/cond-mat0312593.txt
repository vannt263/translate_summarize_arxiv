    "molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) growth of semiconductors has been studied extensively by means of rate equation theories ; in particular , island nucleation and growth of homoepitaxial silicon on silicon is known to be well described by these theories @xcite . on the other hand chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) growth",
    "has been much less well studied theoretically , even though it is widely used in semiconductor technology .",
    "cvd homoepitaxy introduces atoms of one or more species other than that of the substrate , which may alter substantially the physical and chemical properties of the surface , such as the surface free energy and the diffusion of atoms .",
    "clearly island nucleation behavior will also be affected under cvd conditions . in silicon homoepitaxy using disilane si@xmath2h@xmath3 , the surface is hydrogenated as si is deposited - the ratio ( of si to h ) can not be varied .",
    "it is known that the hydrogen atoms passivate the si surface by saturating surface dangling bonds in this study we look at the experimental work of andersohn _",
    "et al_@xcite on the cvd growth of si on si(111 ) using disilane gas .",
    "they obtained results for both mbe and cvd growth of si / si(111 ) . from the perspective of kinetic monte carlo(mc ) simulations , as we shall see later , this cvd process is a straightforward extension of mbe ; we can therefore , look for understanding of mechanisms which contribute to the differences between the two growth processes .",
    "et al _ obtained exponents for the island density @xmath4 versus growth rate @xmath5 of 0.7 for mbe growth and a substantially larger value of 1.25 for cvd - in the latter case rate equation theories were applied naively .",
    "we study this system by means of mc simulations and also generalize and extend standard rate equation theories to systems when more than one mobile species is involved as is appropriate for cvd growth .",
    "our goal is to understand the substantial difference in growth rate exponents between mbe and cvd by carefully incorporating in the growth model the different adatom dynamics in the two cases .",
    "the growth experiments of andersohn _",
    "et al _ were carried out in the temperature range of 480@xmath6c to 540@xmath6c . experimental work on disilane decomposition on si(111)7x7 surfaces",
    "suggests that incident disilane molecules interact with bare ( dangling bond ) si sites and deposit various hydrides such as sih@xmath2 and sih on the surface , with the latter being the only long - lived hydride@xcite .",
    "the dihydride decomposes to the monohydride and hydrogen ; the hydrogen atoms may be left on the substrate to passivate dangling bonds . at the lower end of the above temperature growth range ,",
    "the monohydride breaks down very slowly through h evaporation or desorption .",
    "once a site is passivated by hydrogen or a hydride , no further adsorption of disilane can happen at this site .",
    "stm images show that as a result of hydrogen passivation , the 7x7 surface reconstructions are replaced by the 1x1 h - stablised surface@xcite .",
    "et al _ suggest that for temperatures above 490@xmath6c , the h desorption channel opens up rather substantially through removal by disilane molecules and also through the recombination of hydrogen atoms from two nearest neighbor monohydrides , although this latter process occurs at a much lower rate than the former . in the experiments of andersohn _",
    "et al _ si is deposited on si(111 ) at the rate of 1/10 to 10 bilayers(bl ) per minute .",
    "the cvd experiments are carried out in the submonolayer regime with si coverages @xmath7 monolayers(ml ) . at 480@xmath6c , the low end of the growth temperature range used ,",
    "the hydrogen desorption rate is so small that no significant amount of hydrogen has been removed during deposition .",
    "this is important for cvd experiments , since the high growth exponents seem to apply to the entire temperature range .",
    "this suggests that the large cvd growth exponents may be essentially independent of hydrogen desorption .",
    "andersohn _ et al _ plotted island density @xmath4 against growth rate @xmath8 for mbe growth for the two temperatures , 410@xmath6c and 500@xmath6c for a coverage of @xmath9 bilayers(bl ) ; they fitted their results to the relationship given by rate equation theories@xcite ( ret ) ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the diffusion preexponential and e an activation energy parameter , with the growth or the islanding exponent @xmath12 for two dimensional ( 2d ) islanding for steady state nucleation in the complete condensation regime@xcite . in eq .",
    "[ equ : e1 ] @xmath13 is the critical cluster size for 2d islanding .",
    "they obtained @xmath14 for si / si mbe which corresponds to @xmath15 . for si mbe where there is little or no evaporation , the deposition rate @xmath8 is equal to the growth rate @xmath5 .",
    "et al _ also applied eq .",
    "[ equ : e1 ] to their cvd experiments .",
    "mean growth rates @xmath5 are calculated from the deposition times needed to attain a fixed coverage of about a third of a bilayer @xmath16 bl ) , which is determined from stm images so that material which has diffused to step edges outside the imaged area is excluded from @xmath17 . for cvd growth they obtained exponents in the range @xmath18 , clearly substantially larger than the mbe exponent @xmath19 .",
    "this is manifestly inconsistent with the above ret expression for @xmath13which asserts that @xmath20 must necessarily lie between 0 and 1 .",
    "the failure of the simple rate equation theory for cvd growth suggests that the presence of two or more adatom species may alter nucleation behavior qualitatively , necessitating some new insight into the ret formulation for cvd .",
    "these species comprise adatoms of si and its various hydrides , sih and sih@xmath2@xcite . of the hydrides ,",
    "only sih is long - lived .",
    "the dihydride may decompose into a monohydride with the extra hydrogen going to saturate a neighboring dangling bond on the si(111 ) surface@xcite .",
    "the monohydride should diffuse as a complex , since the si - h bond is very strong @xmath21 3.1ev , compared to typical diffusion barriers of the order of 1ev or less@xcite .",
    "it is known that the mobility of the monohydride is much less than that of si adatom @xcite in the experimental temperature range .",
    "it is reasonable to expect the mobility of the dihydride to be even less than that of sih .",
    "we should also be able to assume that sih@xmath2 moves as a complex , again based on the si - h bonding energies being much larger than surface diffusion activation energies .",
    "kandel@xcite has suggested a different mechanism involving island edge barriers , which we shall discuss later .",
    "andersohn _ et al _ discuss the possible causes for the anomalously high cvd exponents .",
    "they consider various physical possibilities which may affect cvd islanding such as a strong growth rate dependent diffusion parameter @xmath11 , the transformation of the surface reconstruction from ( 7x7 ) to ( 1x1 ) , possible release of additional si atoms from the substrate to form extra islands , and hydrogen etching of the surface , introducing the possibility of incomplete condensation to the nucleation process . in the current work we study the cvd problem by using kinetic monte carlo simulations and also by rate equation analysis .",
    "the mc simulation will be done in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions on a square lattice ( the particular lattice should not matter since our goal is to understand qualitatively the origin of the large exponents and not to obtain quantitative agreement with experiment ) .",
    "activation barriers for diffusion in our simulation are chosen using previous mc simulations for si mbe growth as a guide@xcite and also so as to obtain a maximum attainable ( in terms of reasonable simulation times and problem sizes ) stable critical island size of @xmath22 ( for the cubic lattice ) for no - evaporation mbe growth",
    ". then larger exponents , if they do arise , say , in the cvd case can not be attributed to regular causes .",
    "standard rate equation theories assume a single migrating species , usually lone adatoms .",
    "in our simulations for cvd we will consider one or more diffusing species composed of si adatoms and the silicon hydride complexes .",
    "we will modify rate equation theories to handle the situation with two species .",
    "we carry out mc simulations for the following cases : + ( 1)si mbe without evaporation , + and several distinct situations for cvd growth as given below : + ( 2)migrating species of sih , with h allowed to evaporate and the resulting lone si atom allowed to migrate rapidly to a step edge ; + ( 3)two migrating species of si and sih , with h evaporation allowed ; + ( 4)deposition of sih at a site is accompanied with an extra h saturating a neighboring dangling bond ; this represents the decomposition of sih@xmath2 discussed above , + and finally ; + ( 5)two migrating species , comprising sih@xmath2 and sih , with the former being much slower and short - lived . + the details for the mc simulation model for these cases are presented in section ii . in section",
    "iii we present and discuss the simulation results and provide a critical comparison between the mbe and the cvd case .",
    "we conclude in section iv summarising our results and discussing the extended ret model applied to this problem . in appendix",
    "a we give the details for the generalized rate equation theory appropriate to the two species system .",
    "appendix b gives the standard ret in terms of the actual growth rate rate @xmath5 ( rather than the deposition rate r ) .",
    "mc simulations are carried out in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions on a square lattice .",
    "an adatom or adatom complex moves under the solid - on - solid restriction ( overhangs and/or bulk vacancies are not allowed ) .",
    "these simplifications are not expected to be important for the study of growth exponents .",
    "an adatom moves to a neighboring site by randomly hopping at a rate that depends on its bonding configuration ; this rate is given by    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is a characteristic vibrational frequency and d(=2 , in our case ) is the substrate dimension .",
    "@xmath25 is the activation energy , where n is the number of nearest neighbors and @xmath26 is the energy ( actually the activation barrier ) associated with the bond between nearest neighbors . since we are dealing with up to two different species comprising adatom complexes from si , sih and sih@xmath2",
    ", the parameter @xmath27 will be different for different species .",
    "although this will mean that each species will diffuse at different rates , we will assume that when two adatom complexes are next to one another , the nearest neighbor bonding remains the same irrespective of their species .",
    "this seems to be a reasonable assumption since the bonding is between the si atoms of the hydrides , and the hydrogen atom is not expected to affect this much . even if there is some species dependence of this nearest neighbor bonding or activation energy , this should not affect our qualitative conclusion .",
    "we will also assume that the hydride sih ( and sih@xmath2 ) will hop as a complex since the bond between si and h atoms is extremely strong @xmath28ev@xcite compared to the hopping activation barriers @xmath29ev .",
    "these assumptions are supported by the experiments@xcite of kulkarni _ et al _ on the decomposition of disilane on si(111 ) . in our simulations",
    "we allow for the evaporation of hydrogen through a single evaporation rate for the sake of simplicity .",
    "et al_@xcite describe two possible mechanisms for h removal , but only one is significant in our context .",
    "we do not expect the simplification of using just one h - evaporation rate to affect our conclusions . in accordance with experimental observations@xcite",
    "once a site is passivated by a silicon hydride complex , no further deposition on that site is possible ; correspondingly an adatom complex can only jump to a h free site .",
    "our simulation parameters , together with the deposition and evaporation rates , have been chosen so that a critical island size of @xmath30 is obtained for mbe growth in the temperature ranges of interest .",
    "results from standard nucleation theory@xcite suggest that , for a square lattice as the stable critical island size increases from @xmath31 to 3 ( and then to 10 ) , the deposition rate decreases by two orders of magnitude for each step in the increase of @xmath13 ( i.e. r has to decrease by a factor of @xmath32 if @xmath13 increases from 1 to 10 ) .",
    "we use deposition rates in the range @xmath33 monolayers(ml)/s . for mbe",
    "we obtain straight line plots of ln@xmath4 versus ln@xmath8 , indicating a power law island density growth as a function of the deposition rate , in agreement with eq .",
    "[ equ : e1 ] . at the lower limit of @xmath34 ,",
    "simulation times become so large that it is unlikely that calculations can be extended much below this limit .",
    "exponents larger than @xmath35 , ( i.e. @xmath30 ) for mbe are therefore beyond reasonable simulation times , which is the usual finite time problem in kinetic simulation of very slow dynamics .",
    "note that @xmath36 , satisfying the theoretical ret bound of @xmath37 corresponding to @xmath38 for the island size .",
    "larger exponents ( in the cvd simulations ) have to be attributed to mechanisms not operational in mbe growth .",
    "we explore a variety of growth models .",
    "simple mbe of si on si(111 ) provides a starting reference point .",
    "next , since h plays a critical role in cvd growth and the monohydride is the only long - lived species on the substrate , we study a model where sih is deposited but that the hydrogen is allowed to evaporate at certain rates ; if this results in a lone si adatom , it moves instantaneously to the step edge and is lost to the island nucleation process , as seen in the experiments of andersohn _",
    "et al_. si adatoms are much more mobile than the hydrides@xcite . kulkarni _",
    "et al _ discuss a deposition process where a dihydride breaks up into a monohydride and a hydrogen which passivates a neighboring dangling bond .",
    "we explore the effect of this process on nucleation to see if it would lead to an effective deposition rate dependent diffusion of sih . finally , we look at the situation with two active migrating species .",
    "we assume that of the hydrides the dihydride moves much more slowly than the monohydride .",
    "another example of growth under two migrating species is to consider the combination of si and sih complexes , with the former being much faster than the latter .",
    "however , we do not find exponents markedly different from the mbe case until almost all the h has evaporated from the hydride , which is experimentally not the case . for this reason we will not discuss this case further . in the next section we present and discuss our numerical results based on the kinetic mc simulations of si / si mbe and cvd process .",
    "to model mbe of si on si(111 ) we choose the set of parameters , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "simulations are carried out on system sizes of 320x320 ; results remain essentially the same when the size is increased to 480x480 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot island densities @xmath4 versus deposition rates @xmath8 for the growth temperature t=780k .",
    "the solid curve shows results for mbe growth .",
    "we count islands comprising two or more atoms as stable ; this lower limit of 2 does not seem to affect the numerical value of the growth exponent we get in our simulations . using 3 - 5 atoms as the lower limit on the stable island size gives essentially the same results .",
    "we obtain an mbe growth exponent @xmath41 , corresponding to a critical island nucleus of @xmath30 . over nearly two orders of magnitude in the deposition rate @xmath8 , the ln(n)-ln(r ) plot in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is essentially a straight line , as discussed above .",
    "we also look at the distribution @xmath42 of island size s. in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we display scaled island size distributions for two deposition rates @xmath43 and 16 and coverage @xmath44 .",
    "the lines through points ( squares , diamonds and circles ) are due to a scaling ansatz proposed by amar and family@xcite ,    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the average island size and @xmath47 is a scaling function , with @xmath48 satisfying the relation @xmath49/(\\gamma [ ( i+1)a_i]=(ia^i)^{a_i } ,   c_i=(ia_i)^{(i+1)a_i}/(a_i\\gamma [ ( i+1)a_i]$ ] and @xmath50 is the critical island size .",
    "we see that @xmath51 and is not constant over the range of @xmath52 investigated , which suggests that critical sizes obtained from fitting island distributions with the scaling relation defined by eq .",
    "[ equ : e3 ] is less than those given by rate equations . in our simulations , in contrast to the work of amar and family@xcite , we do not impose the unnecessary constraint that atoms with @xmath50 or more neighbors are not allowed to detach from an existing island .    in the second set of simulations ,",
    "sih is deposited on the substrate at various rates ; the hydride is allowed to move as a complex with a hopping rate defined by the activation energy @xmath39 .",
    "the hydrogen evaporates at certain rates , leaving bare si atoms .",
    "lone si atoms diffuse fast enough so that they are immediately lost to a step edge ( i.e. the atom is effectively removed ) .",
    "this is consistent with the manner in which the growth rate is estimated in the experiments of ref . 1 .",
    "in fig . [ fig1 ]",
    "we display results of simulations for two evaporation rates @xmath53=1200 and 2000 .",
    "both curves approach the mbe results at high deposition rates @xmath8 and show higher slopes at lower @xmath8 indicating higher rates of cvd exponents(at least ) for lower deposition rates .",
    "these higher exponents are consistent with rate equation theory results for incomplete condensation@xcite",
    ". however , the exponents of andersohn _ et al _ are obtained from plots of island density @xmath4 versus the effective growth rate @xmath5 , not the deposition rate @xmath8 .",
    "the growth rate @xmath5 is estimated from the accumulating material that stays within the area imaged by the stm used in data analysis .",
    "when our results are replotted against @xmath5 , the two curves rescale to the mbe results for all growth rates , and the effective cvd exponent for @xmath54 becomes the same as the mbe exponent for @xmath55 .",
    "this effect can also be seen in rate equation theories which we discuss in appendix b.    andersohn _",
    "et al_@xcite discuss the possibility of a strong growth rate dependence of the diffusion parameter @xmath11 , due to the presence of hydrogen .",
    "et al_@xcite show that among the various surface chemical reactions that can happen , there is one where a silicon dihydride complex breaks up into a monohydride complex and a hydrogen which saturates a neighboring dangling bond ; at low coverages , this dangling bond is likely to be associated with a substrate si atom with four si nearest neighbors , which would make _ this _ particular sih complex essentially immobile .",
    "it is possible that this h atom , produced by the local chemical reaction sih@xmath56 sih+h , will reduce the effective mobility of a nearby mobile sih complex .",
    "we test this idea in our simulations by depositing sih@xmath2 which breaks up immediately into a monohydride and a hydrogen atom .",
    "this atom passivates a neighboring dangling bond site chosen at random within 2 lattice spacings from the monohydride ; all lone monohydrides are allowed to move with hopping rates determined by the parameters above , no hydrogen evaporation is considered .",
    "we show these modified simulation results also in fig .",
    "the curves are parallel to the line for mbe ; they are shifted towards higher densities , giving the same value ( @xmath21 0.6 ) for the exponent @xmath57 .",
    "it is as if the h has increased the effective deposition rate by a fixed percentage for all growth rates without in any way affecting the underlying island scaling behavior .",
    "et al_@xcite has noted that the presence of h changes the 7x7 reconstruction of the surface to a 1x1 h - terminated surface which may result in up to 20% of the material in island nuclei coming from the substrate itself . as noted above the result of increasing",
    "the effective deposition rate by a fixed percentage simply raises the curve by a constant amount without changing the growth exponent .",
    "thus , this mechanism should not affect the exponent in any significant manner .",
    "finally we simulate growth due to the explicit presence of two species on the substrate .",
    "et al_@xcite show that above 250@xmath6c , disilane decomposes to leave sih@xmath2 on the surface .",
    "this dihydride in turn breaks down to leave the monohydride plus hydrogen which may or may not desorb .",
    "since this hydrogen does not affect the growth exponent , as we discuss above , we will neglect it in our simulation and simply allow it to desorb .",
    "consider the two adatom species : sih@xmath2 which is first deposited has a very short lifetime and so we take sih to be infinitely long - lived .",
    "we use the same bonding strength @xmath58 for both and @xmath39 for the diffusion of sih ; since sih@xmath2 is very much less mobile than sih , we take @xmath27 for sih@xmath2 to be 2ev",
    ". the breakup rate of sih@xmath2 is given by setting @xmath53=730 , chosen to optimize the exponent .",
    "clearly , this parameter @xmath53 sets the proportion of sih to sih@xmath2 on the substrate in the steady state .",
    "the results are not sensitive to this particular value of @xmath53 .",
    "the experimental evidence is overwhelming that hydrogen is essential in maintaining growth with the high exponent value @xcite .",
    "if the flux of disilane is low or growth occurs at high temperatures so that hydrogen desorption is fast enough to keep the surface essentially h free , then the cvd growth becomes essentially the same as the mbe growth in terms of the value of the islanding exponent . for this reason and",
    "due to the fact that large cvd exponents are seen in growth at 480@xmath6c and 500@xmath6c when h desorption is insignificant@xcite , we ignore the loss of h by sih itself in our simulations . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we plot the results of @xmath59 versus deposition rate for this case of 2-species growth .",
    "the exponent @xmath60 is higher than that for mbe of 0.6 ( which corresponds to @xmath30 ) . on the basis of the old rate equation theories an exponent of 0.9 corresponds to a critical nucleus of @xmath61 , which is greater than the size of the majority of the islands for the high deposition rates , @xmath62 . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , the island distribution results averaged over 40 - 50 samples , for @xmath43 are displayed , together with the scaling relations for @xmath63 and 3 .",
    "clearly the results do not really fit any one relation but are closest to the @xmath64 curve for @xmath65 , while they are closest to the @xmath31 curve at @xmath66 ; here the implication is that @xmath67 does not agree with @xmath68 as suggested by rate equation theories . in fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , the corresponding curve for @xmath69 shows no agreement with any of the scaling relationsips at all .",
    "island density declines monotonically to a tail longer than those due to scaling .",
    "thus , in the presence of 2-species migration - induced islanding and growth , simple scaling relations break down and the effective scaling exponent @xmath20 becomes very large indicating a failure of the simple scaling relation .",
    "rate equation theories show that for 2 and 3d islanding , growth exponents of @xmath70 occur in the steady state case , only under regimes of extreme incomplete and initially incomplete condensation@xcite .",
    "our kinetic mc simulations , including those not covered by standard rate equation theories , indicate that it is not simple to obtain these high growth exponents from naive cvd simulations . even in the case which involves evaporation of h",
    ", the high exponent at low effective growth rate reduces to the low exponent case when island density is plotted against growth rate @xmath5 instead of deposition rate @xmath8 .",
    "as we will see in appendix b the case of initially incomplete condensation collapses into that of complete condensation when the island density is plotted against growth rate @xmath5 ; the exponent @xmath71 for 3d and 2d islanding respectively@xcite . in our simulations",
    ", we explored several physical processes and mechanisms suggested by the cvd experiments .",
    "we find that the mechanism of the change of surface reconstruction from 7x7 to 1x1 , which can increase the effective deposition rate by a given percentage , can not increase the exponent .",
    "et al_@xcite suggest that a monomer diffusion constant that is strongly @xmath8 dependent could account for the high exponent ; we explored a possible way - the codeposition of h in the neighborhood of a deposited monohydride - and found that this merely raised island densities without increasing @xmath57 .",
    "it is interesting that this has the same effect as increasing the deposition rate by a fixed percentage .",
    "based on the investigations@xcite of kulkarni _ et al _ , who showed that at the growth temperatures of ref .",
    "1 disilane deposits a dihydride on the substrate which subsequently breaks up into h and the monohydride , we investigate a growth model involving these two hydrides ( `` the 2-species migration model '' for cvd ) . the important characteristics of this model are that each hydride is assumed to move as a complex , since the sih bond is known to be very strong and that the dihydride , which moves much more slowly than the monohydride , has a much shorter lifetime . in our simulations of this two component system an effective growth exponent @xmath20 50% higher than the corresponding mbe case ( @xmath72 ) is obtained .",
    "we find @xmath73 for the square lattice 2-component cvd growth and expect to see still higher exponents for the realistic diamond lattice where the smallest stable clusters of size greater than three would be accessible to simulations within reasonable times .",
    "our conclusion is , therefore , that this 2-component model of 2-species migration is operational in the cvd growth of ref.1 , leading to very large cvd growth exponents .    in appendix",
    "a we discuss the extension of walton s expression for the equilibrium density of critical clusters@xcite to the two component system that we study here .",
    "we then extend standard rate equation theories@xcite to these systems and show that the exponent goes as @xmath74 instead of @xmath75 for 2d islanding and @xmath76 instead of @xmath77 for 3d islanding .",
    "large growth exponents have also been shown to arise when island edge barriers @xmath78 are present@xcite .",
    "kandel suggests@xcite that these edge barriers may occur in surfactant mediated growth ; an adatom can only be attached to the edge of an island after surfactant atoms have been removed .",
    "the energy barrier required for such an interchange may be very large .",
    "kandel argues that the h in disilane cvd on si plays the role of surfactant atoms .",
    "kandel s work has been discussed and criticised in some detail by venables and brune@xcite ; they showed that this island edge barrier has significant consequences : even a modest edge barrier would cause the steady state nucleation stage when the population of monomers @xmath79 has become constant , to be greatly delayed , that is , the transient stage ( @xmath80 ) will become substantially extended . here",
    "z is the coverage due to clusters excluding monomers .",
    "this is because the capture numbers @xmath81 , which determine the rate of removal of monomers by clusters of size 1 and @xmath82 respectively , are reduced by the factor @xmath83 and , therefore , nucleation times are enormously increased by the inverse of this factor .",
    "our estimates are that , with the parameters we use in our simulations , a barrier of @xmath84 1ev is enough to move the transient regime up into the range of coverages of the order of 0.1ml .",
    "venables and brune conclude that the exponent of @xmath85 obtained by kandel , based on steady - state results may not be valid for his comparisons with experiments@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we examine the assumption that h behaves as a surfactant .",
    "et al _ have shown@xcite that si - h moves as a complex ; as we have noted before , the si - h bond is very strong@xcite , so that the h atom does not behave like a surfactant .",
    "there is no exchange of si with hydrogen for the silicon atom to join an island at the edge of the island .",
    "it is known that once hydrogen passivates a dangling bond on the si surface , there can be no further growth on top@xcite .",
    "our conclusion based on our kinetic mc simulations is that the large cvd exponents reported in ref.1 arise from a failure of the simple island number scaling scenario in the 2-component migration condition prevailing under cvd growth .",
    "more experiments and simulations are obviously needed to settle the issue definitively .",

    "these two types of monomers move with diffusion constants @xmath89 and @xmath90 , but in forming islands the monomers are linked to each other by bonds of the same strength @xmath26 , so that clusters of size i have energies @xmath91 , which are independent of the detailed composition of adatom complexes of type 1h and 2h . under these conditions",
