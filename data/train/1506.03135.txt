    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are important astrophysical objects , as they play a central role in measuring the accelerative expansion of the universe and are primary source of iron - group elements ( ige ) in the universe .",
    "however , the progenitor system(s ) and detailed explosion mechanism(s ) have been a matter of considerable debate ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "it has been believed that sne ia are runaway thermonuclear explosions of a c / o white dwarf ( wd ) , as it approaches the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath71.4m@xmath1 ) .",
    "there are mainly two long - standing competing scenarios for how a wd increases its mass : ( 1 ) the single - degenerate model , in which a wd accretes material from a non - degenerate companion star in a close binary system @xcite ; and ( 2 ) the double - degenerate model , in which two c / o wds merge @xcite .",
    "therefore , identifying the progenitor stars ( as a means of discriminating between the two scenarios ) is an area of considerable activity in sn ia studies .",
    "there are many observational approaches to identifying progenitors , including studies of potential progenitor populations @xcite , searches for companions to the progenitor systems in optical pre / post - explosion images ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and surviving companions in nearby supernova remnants ( snrs ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and evidence of interactions between the sn ejecta and the companion star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , recent detection of a circumstellar medium in some sne ia ( csm : environmental gas modified by the mass loss from the progenitor systems ) have opened a new window to infer progenitor systems .",
    "the presence of a h - rich csm itself supports the sd scenario , since such a csm is not generally expected around two wds in the dd scenario .",
    "analysis of the csm signature ( both absorption and emission ) offers further insight into the progenitor system .",
    "for example , time - variable na i d absorption features , which were found in the normal type ia sn  2006x and a few others @xcite , could be interpreted to arise from expanding shells ( or knots ) due to successive nova eruptions of the progenitor @xcite .",
    "later , @xcite found that about half of all sampled sne ia ( 12/22 ) in their sample show blueshifted na i d absorption lines , while only a quarter of them ( 5/22 ) show redshifted absorption , and the remaining quarter ( 5/22 ) show single or symmetric absorption profiles .",
    "they suggested that the biased detection of the blueshifted systems means a large fraction of sne ia ( @xmath1125% ) are associated with progenitors gas outflows ( otherwise , we would see the same fractions of blueshifted and redshifted profiles ) . from the absorption column densities ( @xmath12@xmath13 ) ,",
    "the masses of the csm shells have been estimated to be @xmath140.01m@xmath1 @xcite , which are consistent with successive recurrent nova eruptions that swept up the stellar wind of the companion .",
    "therefore , these csm properties can be best explained by a symbiotic recurrent nova progenitor , similar to rs ophiuchi .",
    "evidence for much more massive csm ( @xmath70.015m@xmath1 ) has been found in several sne ia ( sn  2002ic , sn  2005gj , sn  1997cy , sn  1999e , sn  2008j , ptf11kx , and some other candidates : * ? ? ?",

    "these sne are called  sne ia - csm \" which are characterized by a narrow h@xmath15 line on top of an overluminous ( sn  1991t - like or 91t - like ) ia template in the optical spectra .",
    "sne ia - csm comprise only a small fraction of sne ia : 0.11% @xcite , albeit a true fraction may be somewhat larger , given a possibly significant amount of sne ia - csm that are incorrectly classified as type iin because of their spectral resemblance @xcite . while there are several proposed progenitor systems for ia - csm objects , none of them is yet conclusive .",
    "kepler s snr , the remains of sn  1604 a.d .",
    ", is one of a handful of snrs which are associated with historical galactic sne .",
    "located at only 37kpc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) , this remnant provides a precious opportunity to study details of sn ia explosions and the progenitor system .",
    "it belongs to a rare class of type ia snrs @xcite that exhibit emission from a csm , evidenced by the extremely high ambient density ( @xmath7100@xmath16 ) at @xmath11500pc out of the galactic plane and a n overabundance @xcite .",
    "optical monitoring of 50 long - lived csm knots revealed that they are moving fairly slowly , with a space velocity of @xmath7280kms@xmath10 at a distance of 4.5kpc @xcite ; reminiscent of quasi - stationary flocculi in cassiopeia  a. the trace - back time was measured to be @xmath17yrs , which should be taken as a lower limit , given possible acceleration by the sn forward shock .",
    "@xcite found infrared ( ir ) emission from warm dust .",
    "since the ir intensity map is similar to the distribution of the dense optical csm knots , the authors argued that the ir emission arises from dust in the shocked csm .",
    "@xcite further supported this picture based on _ spitzer space telescope _ observations , and estimated the total shocked csm mass to be @xmath71m@xmath1 from their relatively cursory analysis of x - ray data .",
    "in addition to the csm knots , the presence of a diffuse csm has been inferred using followup _ spitzer _",
    "observations by @xcite .",
    "their work indicates that the csm dust consists of two components : lower - temperature ( @xmath780100k ) dust behind fast shocks ( @xmath181000kms@xmath10 ) and penetrating into the tenuous ambient medium produces the majority of the ir emission ; higher - temperature ( @xmath18150k ) dust behind slower shocks ( a few hundred kms@xmath10 ) penetrating into high density material ( @xmath19@xmath16 ) coincides with the optical dense knots .",
    "the presence of a csm is also supported from recent hydrodynamic simulations @xcite , where a high mass - loss rate of @xmath20m@xmath1yr@xmath10 , suggestive of dense winds from an asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star , can reasonably explain the observed expansion index and the north - south asymmetric morphology of kepler s snr .",
    "x - rays arise predominantly from sn ejecta , which are not detected at either optical or ir wavelengths .",
    "the x - ray spectrum exhibits strong fe l lines and weak o k lines .",

    "more recently , @xcite performed a deep _ suzaku _ observation , and found a high mn / cr line intensity ratio of @xmath70.6 , leading them to suggest a supersolar metallicity ( @xmath73 times the solar value ) of the progenitor star .    here",
    ", we investigate x - ray spectra of kepler s snr and two other young ia snrs , tycho s snr and snr  0509 - 67.5 , for comparison , by making the best use of available data from currently operational x - ray observatories . in the following section 2",
    ", we summarize the observations used . in sections 3 and 4",
    ", we perform x - ray spectral analyses , focusing mainly on the sn ejecta and the csm , respectively .",
    "finally , we discuss the observational results and lead to conclusions .",
    "we use archival data obtained by _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ , and _ suzaku _ , as summarized in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "while our object of interest is kepler s snr , we also analyze two similarly - aged ia remnants , tycho s snr and snr  0509 - 67.5 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "detailed classifications have already been determined for these two remnants , based on their light - echo spectra : tycho is thought to be a prototypical type ia @xcite , snr  0509 - 67.5 is thought to be",
    " sn  1991t - like \" @xcite .",
    "thus these two remnants can serve as ideal reference targets to study the amount of ige in kepler s sn .",
    "we reprocessed the raw data , using version 13.5.0 of _ xmm - newton _ science analysis software , version 4.6 of _ chandra _ interactive analysis of observations , and version 22 of the _ suzaku _ software , together with the latest versions of the calibration files at the analysis phase . for the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis :",
    "* ) onboard _ suzaku _ , we focus on front - illuminated ccds ( xis0 and xis3 ) which have slightly better spectral resolution than the back - illuminated ccd ( xis1 ) .",
    "we generated response files for the _ xmm - newton _ reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , taking account of energy - dependent spatial structures in the source , as we did in our previous analyses of the galactic snr puppis  a @xcite .",
    "the first - order rgs spectral resolution , which is determined by the size of the remnants in our case , is roughly @xmath2225 and 180 for kepler s snr and snr  0509 - 67.5 , respectively .",
    "this resolution is higher than that of the xis of @xmath2215 .",
    "backgrounds ( bgs ) were taken from source - free regions in the same fields of view .",
    "the exception is the rgs spectrum for kepler s snr , for which the spatial extent of the source - free areas is limited ; hence we used blank - sky data ( obs .",
    "i d : 0051940401 ) taken immediately after the observation of kepler s snr .",
    "each spectrum was grouped into bins with at least 20 counts in order to allow us to perform a @xmath23 test .",
    "we first examine the wide - band x - ray spectra for the three snrs .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec_comp ] shows integrated _ suzaku _ xis spectra of the snrs , where the intensities are normalized to equalize the si he@xmath15 line .",
    "a number of emission lines are apparent , mostly arising from the shocked sn ejecta . obviously , the strengths of fe lines ( both l- and k - shell transitions ) are quite different among the three sources , whereas k - shell lines from intermediate mass elements ( ime : si , s , ar , and ca ) are similar to one another , in the sense that shock - heated ige - to - ime mass ratios for kepler s snr and snr  0509 - 67.5 are significantly larger than that for tycho s snr .",
    "it is reasonable to consider that the amount of unshocked cold ejecta in the three snrs is similar among the remnants , based on their similar ages ( @xmath7400yr ) , close evolutionary states @xcite , and the similar reverse shock positions ( @xmath770% of the forward shock radius ) as we describe below .",
    "therefore , kepler s sn must have produced a relatively large mass of ige , similar to snr  0509 - 67.5 . when combined with information from light - echo spectra , i.e. , overluminous for snr  0509 - 67.5 and normal for tycho s snr",
    ", we argue that kepler s sn was likely an overluminous ia event .",
    "this argument will be substantiated by our spectral fitting in the following section .",
    "there are reasons why spectral fitting is required to estimate the ejecta masses quantitatively and correctly .",
    "for example , while snr  0509 - 67.5 has the strongest apparent fe l lines below 1kev in the raw xis spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_comp ] , these lines are considerably weaker than those of kepler s snr , if we correct for the interstellar absorption . also notable",
    "is the slight shift of the line center energies of snr  0509 - 67.5 with respect to those of the two galactic snrs . this shift is due not to artificial / instrumental effects , but to a mixture of bulk motions and ionization effects , as we will show below .",
    "since the ionization state is sensitive to x - ray line intensities , we need to care about it in estimating ejecta masses .",
    "all of these effects can be accounted for through spectral fitting .      in our spectral fitting",
    ", we use _ xmm - newton _ s rgs below 2kev and _ suzaku _ s xis above 2kev for kepler s snr and snr  0509 - 67.5 . on the other hand , for tycho s snr",
    ", we use only data from _ suzaku _ s xis , since the  slitless \" rgs can not provide a high - resolution spectrum due to the relatively large angular size of the remnant ( diameter of @xmath78.5@xmath24 ) .",
    "spatially - integrated x - ray spectra for the three snrs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_whole ] . in these plots ,",
    "only the first - order rgs spectra are shown , but we use both first and second orders when modeling the data .",
    "the data points in blue for kepler s snr is a local - bg subtracted csm spectrum extracted from the summed - up regions of knots 1 and 2 ( see , section  4 ) , by using",
    "_ chandra _",
    "s advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis : * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we fit this spectrum with a csm - only model having all normalizations of ejecta components fixed to zero , so that we can separate out the csm emission as cleanly as possible . note that , for the spectrum of tycho s snr , we exclude data below 0.6kev owing to poor signal - to - noise ratios due to a relatively heavy interstellar absorption together with the low energy tail emission from higher energy lines @xcite , and in the 1.55kev1.75kev band due to a si - edge calibration concern with the xis .",
    "we fit these spatially - integrated spectra with an absorbed , vpshock + three vneis + power - law + several gaussian components model in the xspec package @xcite . here , the vpshock and the power - law components are supposed to be the thermal and synchrotron radiation , respectively , from the swept - up medium .",
    "the three vnei components represent emission from sn ejecta .",
    "at least three vnei components are required from a statistical point of view ( f - test probability of @xmath1899% ) ; we chose to not add more in order to keep our model as simple as possible .",
    "the several gaussian components represent lines of fe l and/or o k , fe l and/or ne k , cr k , and mn k not well represented in the broad band models .",
    "while details of our parameter treatment can be found in table  [ tab : param ] , we elaborate some of them below .",
    "we fix the abundance of either si / h or fe / h to be 10@xmath25 times the solar value , assuming that the three vnei components are nearly pure metal plasmas .",
    "most of the emission from ime is reproduced by two vnei components , for which the two - components nature may reflect a temperature / density gradient within the shocked ejecta ; e.g. , a hydrodynamical model of type ia snr evolution in a uniform ambient density predicts a strong temperature decrease ( as well as density increase ) from the reverse shock to the contact discontinuity @xcite . for these components",
    ", we tie the metal abundances to each other except for fe ( and ni ) .",
    "the remaining vnei component is introduced to reproduce most of the fe k emission .",
    "we assume the ni / fe abundance ratio to be that expected in the classical deflagration model ( w7 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the assumed value of ni / fe abundance does not affect our spectral fitting , since ni lines are not clearly detected in the spectra .",
    "in this fe - rich component , we allow abundances of ar and ca to vary freely ; otherwise we see significant residuals at low - energy sides of the k lines of these elements , especially for tycho s snr .",
    "this would indicate that some ar and ca may be mixed into ige - rich layers , although we can not rule out other possibilities , e.g. , the presence of strongly redshifted components for these elements . in any case , the ejecta masses will not change dramatically , hence we here adopt the simplest solution in terms of the spectral modeling .",
    "we fix the absorbing column densities at @xmath26@xmath13 , 1@xmath27@xmath13 , and @xmath28@xmath13 adopting elemental abundances given by @xcite for kepler s snr , tycho s snr , and snr  0509 - 67.5 , respectively .",
    "the values for the two galactic snrs are determined by fitting synchrotron - dominated spectra from the outermost thin rims obtained by the _ chandra _",

    "photon indices are allowed to vary freely .",
    "in addition , we multiply the gsmooth model to each thermal component in order to take account of line - broadening effects , for which we assume the widths to be proportional to the line energies .    as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : spec_whole ] , the best - fit models in green represent the data well .",
    "individual components are shown in blue ( swept - up medium ) , red ( ejecta1 = the lower - temperature ime - dominated component ) , orange ( ejecta2 = the higher temperature ime - dominated component ) , light blue ( ejecta3 = the fe - rich component ) , gray ( power - law ) , and dotted black ( gaussians ) .",
    "note for kepler s snr that the swept - up components seen for both _ xmm - newton _ s rgs and _ chandra _ s acis have the same intrinsic spectral shapes , but look different due to distinct spectral responses .",
    "the lower panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_whole ] show residuals ; the red points represent the rgs second order data that are not shown in the upper panels .",
    "the reduced-@xmath23 values summarized in table  [ tab : param ] are 1.38 ( snr  0509 - 67.5 ) , 1.45 ( kepler s snr ) , and 2.91 ( tycho s snr ) . the relatively large value for tycho s snr is not surprising , given that it is the brightest source of the three snrs and the larger spectral bin widths ( 3.65ev at the minimum using the xis ) than those of the other two sources ( @xmath351ev using rgs ) , making systematic uncertainties relatively serious for this snr .",
    "we do not , however , introduce systematic uncertainties in our spectral fitting , since they do not affect our main conclusions .",
    "we check the robustness of our spectral analysis by comparing the best - fit parameters in table  [ tab : param ] with previous measurements .",
    "first of all , the n abundance of the swept - up ( vpshock ) component in kepler s snr is quantitatively consistent with previous optical measurements @xcite , showing that this component is the cno - processed stellar wind material , i.e. , the csm , as we expected .",
    "also , the lines in the csm component ( mainly n ly@xmath15 , o he@xmath15 , and o ly@xmath15 ) are significantly narrower than those of ejecta components , assuring robustness of the spectral separation between the csm and the ejecta . unfortunately , the data do not allow us to measure n abundances or line widths of the csm components for the other two snrs because of the relatively poor spectral resolution ( tycho s snr ) and statistics ( snr  0509 - 67.5 ) .",
    "as for the photon indices , the best - fit values agree with previous x - ray measurements ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , by converting the line broadening of the ejecta component to bulk velocities , we obtain @xmath36 = 2740@xmath37kms@xmath10 , 2970@xmath38kms@xmath10 , and 3570@xmath39kms@xmath10 for kepler s snr , tycho s snr , and snr  0509 - 67.5 , respectively , where the velocities include effects of both thermal broadening and shell expansion whose contributions are hard to distinguish from our data .",
    "these are somewhat smaller than previous estimates for tycho s snr @xcite and snr  0509 - 67.5 @xcite , which might be explained by multiple ionization effects in our analysis .",
    "we next look into details of ejecta components .",
    "figure  [ fig : ejecta_comp ] illustrates unabsorbed spectra of the total ejecta components with intensities normalized at si k - shell lines , in order to clearly reveal the differences among the three snrs .",
    "we can readily see that the fe k and l lines for kepler s snr and snr  0509 - 67.5 are much stronger than those for tycho s snr .",
    "this is also evident from the spectral ratios in the lower panel .",
    "we then quantitatively estimate ejecta masses , using the best - fit parameters listed in table  [ tab : param ] . as the first step",

    "study for kepler s snr @xcite .",
    "in addition , we find that the peak position of ne - like fe l lines ( 0.70.85kev ) is located systematically inside that of the more ionized fe l lines ( 0.91.2kev ) .",
    "this fact suggests that in each remnant , the fe is indeed primarily sn ejecta heated by a reverse shock propagating toward the center .",
    "these radial profiles are deprojected by using the  onion - peeling \" method , which estimates the emission at each radius repeated removal of the contribution from concentric outer shells ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "since the profiles of kepler s snr look similar to those of snr  0509 - 67.5 , we assume that the emitting geometries are the same .",
    "the reverse shock radii , @xmath44 , are taken to be the sharp rises of the fe k ( and ne - like fe l ) , which are 0.7 and 0.65 times the forward shock radii , @xmath45 , for kepler s snr and tycho s snr , respectively , where we define @xmath45 from eye inspections to be 107@xmath46 , 256@xmath46 , and 14.8@xmath46 for kepler s snr , tycho s snr , and snr  0509 - 67.5 , respectively .",

    "the outer extent of the ime - rich components for kepler s snr ( tycho s snr ) is taken to be 0.97 ( 0.93 ) @xmath45 , which corresponds to the position where we see a sharp rise of the deprojected si k profile for kepler s snr ( tycho s snr ) .",
    "we note that the value for tycho s snr represents the contact discontinuity suggested from a previous _ chandra _ study @xcite .",
    "we allocate volume filling factors for the two ime - rich vnei components , such that their electron pressures are equalized : ( @xmath48 : @xmath49 ) = ( 0.05 : 0.95 ) , ( 0.2 : 0.8 ) , and ( 0.015 : 0.985 ) for kepler s snr , tycho s snr , and snr  0509 - 67.5 , respectively .",
    "we then compute densities and masses for individual elements in each ejecta component .",
    "we note that the surface brightness of kepler s snr is quite asymmetric ; the northern rim is much brighter than the southern rim .",
    "this could lead to biased mass estimates , if we use only one side ( either north or south ) of the rim in estimating emitting volumes .",
    "therefore , we examine radial profiles of the southern portion in addition to those of the northern portion , finding that the reverse shock position as well as the ige and ime layers are close to those of tycho s snr rather than the northern portion of kepler s snr .",

    "this result quantitatively confirms our expectation ( from the spectral comparison in figs .",
    "[ fig : spec_comp ] and [ fig : ejecta_comp ] ) that kepler s sn was an overluminous ( 91t - like ) ia event .",

    "snr  0509 - 67.5 can be found in a marginal region between overluminous and normal ia events .",
    "threfore , this plot shows that the amount of ige of kepler s snr is even larger than that of the confirmed overluminous ia snr  0509 - 67.5 , strongly supporting the idea that kepler s sn was an overluminous ia event .",
    "it should be noted in table  [ tab : ejecta_mass ] that ( 1 ) we provide fairly conservative uncertainties which are much larger than those from the statistical uncertainties in table  [ tab : param ] ; ( 2 ) we list unshocked ige masses , based on sn ia nucleosynthesis models @xcite combined with the reverse - shock positions estimated above ; and ( 3 ) we assume that the total ime + ige mass becomes @xmath71.05m@xmath1 @xcite by adjusting the distances to the remnants .",
    "the details are described below .    to evaluate the errors , we consider a wider range of the electron temperature for the hot fe - rich component than the statistical uncertainties , given possible systematic uncertainties on fe l emissivities .",
    "in fact , even if we fix @xmath502kev and @xmath5015kev for this component , we derive similar quality fits ; reduced-@xmath23 values for @xmath502kev and 15kev are , respectively , 1.54 and 1.49 for kepler s snr , 3.55 and 3.02 for tycho s snr , and 1.42 ( for both 2kev and 15kev ) for snr  0509 - 67.5 .",
    "thus , we consider these extreme temperature cases to be viable , and they provide the major source of the large uncertainties in table  [ tab : ejecta_mass ] .    the upper two rows of figure  [ fig : mass_vs_dist ] show the masses of shocked ime and ige as a function of distance for three cases : the best fits in the red solid curves ; @xmath51kev in the black dashed curves ; and @xmath52kev in the black dotted curves .",
    "the third row shows unshocked ejecta masses for two sn ia abundance distributions : the classical w7 model ( the upper curve : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a two - dimensional ( azimuthally - averaged ) delayed - detonation model , i.e. , off - center ignition o - ddt model ( the lower curve : * ? ? ?",
    "while both of the two models are not responsible for overluminous ia sne but for normal ia sne , the amount and composition of the unshocked ejecta would not be different by much , since the abundance distributions of the two models examined here look ( more ) similar to those of overluminous cases rather than subluminous cases by @xcite . to estimate the cold ejecta masses , we integrate the ejecta masses from @xmath53 up to @xmath54/age ( the free expansion velocity at the reverse shock ) .",
    "we find that the composition of the unshocked ejecta is almost pure ige for both models , hence we name the y - axis label as  cold ige .",
    "\" the bottom panels show the total masses ( hot ime + hot ige + cold ige ) .    in principle , the ejecta masses can take any values ( even unrealistic ones ) , by changing the temperature and/or distances ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mass_vs_dist ] ) .",
    "therefore , we introduce one constraint that the total masses of ige plus ime are within 0.961.14m@xmath1 , according to a systematic analysis of 23 samples of well - observed extragalactic sne ia @xcite . in the bottom panels ,",
    "this mass range is given as horizontal dotted lines .",
    "limiting the total masses in this range , we can constrain distances to the remnants for each temperature case . the distances for the best - fit cases ( in between the two solid red lines ) are @xmath74.2kpc , @xmath72.55kpc , and @xmath746kpc for kepler s snr , tycho s snr , and snr  0509 - 67.5 , respectively . while the values for the two galactic snrs agree with some of previous estimates @xcite ,",
    "all of the distances are slightly smaller than the canonical values @xcite .",
    "in particular , the distance to snr  0509 - 67.5 in the lmc is relatively well determined . thus ,",
    "if we set the distance to the current best estimate of 48.1kpc @xcite , we obtain the total ime+ige mass to be @xmath71.2m@xmath1 ( see , fig .",

    "this is just slightly larger than the upper end ( 1.14m@xmath1 ) expected for sne ia @xcite , and such a deviation would be still acceptable . on the other hand , there is also a possibility that snr  0509 - 67.5 whose absorption within the lmc is negligible is indeed located at @xmath72kpc front side with respect to the main body of the lmc . since accurate measurements of the total masses and distances , which require significant additional analysis efforts , are beyond the scope of this paper , we leave this issue for future work based on high - resolution x - ray spectra which will be available with the upcoming _ astro - h _ @xcite . keeping the total ime+ige masses within 0.961.14m@xmath1",

    "we find a line feature at @xmath70.5kev , which can be modeled by n ly@xmath15 arising from the swept - up component .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : param ] ; they show the presence of an enhanced n abundance in the swept - up component , similar to that found for the entire remnant ( figure  [ fig : spec_whole ] and table  [ tab : param ] ) .",
    "this is evidence that this component originates from the cno - processed csm , revealing that the diffuse csm can be seen in x - rays as well as in the ir @xcite .",
    "the diffuse csm can be reasonably interpreted as material in steady outflow from the progenitor system , which refilled a cavity created by the major eruption a few 10@xmath55yrs ago suggested by optical proper motions of the csm knots @xcite .",
    "the density and the mass of the diffuse csm are calculated to be 2.8@xmath16 and 0.08m@xmath1 , respectively , at a distance of 4.2kpc , based on the assumption that the emitting region is a polar - cap shell of 0.971 @xmath45 with a filling factor of unity .",
    "this density is consistent with that inferred from ir observations @xcite .",
    "the total mass integrated over the entire remnant is @xmath70.3m@xmath1 , given that the region we examined covers only @xmath730% of the entire remnant .",
    "it should be noted that the total mass might increase by a factor of a few if we take into account the north - south asymmetry seen in both the ir and x - rays . assuming a wind speed of @xmath5610kms@xmath10 , we estimate a mass - loss rate of 1.5@xmath57(@xmath9/10kms@xmath10)m@xmath1yr@xmath10 , is needed to provide the estimated mass of 0.3m@xmath1 within a radius of 2.1pc at a distance of 4.2kpc .",
    "such a large mass - loss rate suggests that the progenitor is an agb star , which is consistent with results from recent hydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "next , we turn to the bright knotty features which are positionally coincident with optically bright knots .",

    "[ fig : kepler_chandra_spec ] .",
    "the best - fit parameters are summarized in table  [ tab : csm ] .",
    "the temperatures and ionization timescales are roughly consistent with those derived from the integrated rgs spectrum ( table  [ tab : param ] ) and previous",
    "_ chandra _",
    "measurements @xcite .    to derive densities and masses",
    ", we assume the x - ray  emitting plasma s geometry to be spherical for knot-2 and a rugby - ball shape for the others .",
    "we also assume filling factors to be unity for all the regions .",
    "the estimated densities and masses are listed in table  [ tab : csm ] .",
    "the densities are an order of magnitude lower than the optical measurements @xcite , suggesting that x - rays arise from relatively tenuous regions surrounding ( or close to ) optical dense cores .",
    "the total mass of the five regions is 1.1@xmath5810@xmath59m@xmath1 .",
    "clearly , these regions contain quite limited amounts of the total csm knots , since the optical csm knots are distributed more widely than the selected regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed ,",
    "the normalization summed - up for the five regions ( see , table  [ tab : csm ] ) is only @xmath71/40 of the rgs - measured normalization integrated for the entire remnant ( see , table  [ tab : param ] ) .",
    "part of the integrated normalization should be attributed to the diffuse csm , whose fraction is estimated to be @xmath720% , based on the normalizations of the entire remnant and the southern part in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "thus , we infer the total mass of the knotty csm in the entire remnant to be @xmath70.035m@xmath1 ( = 1.1@xmath5810@xmath59m@xmath60 ) .",
    "this would be slightly increased by adding optically emitting knots .",
    "such a large amount of the csm is consistent with those observed in sne ia - csm .    unlike ia - csm sne",
    ", the dense / knotty csm in kepler s snr is located far away from the progenitor star , as evidenced by three independent pieces of information .",
    "first , the slow proper motions of the csm knots measured in optical @xcite allow movements of only 5.3@xmath46 ( or 0.1pc at a distance of 4.2kpc ) after the explosion .",
    "this is evidence that the knots were already @xmath72pc ( i.e. , the snr radius ) away from the progenitor star at the time of the sn explosion .",
    "second , dividing the ionization timescale by the electron density in table  [ tab : csm ] , we infer the shock - heating time to be @xmath750200yrs .",
    "this means that interactions between the csm and the blastwave started at a very late phase , i.e. , @xmath11200yrs after the explosion .",
    "third , the light curve of kepler s sn does not show any hints of early - phase csm interactions .",
    "figure  [ fig : kepler_lc ] shows two light curves of kepler s sn obtained by european observers in black and korean observers in red @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "we show typical light curves of several kinds of sne , i.e. , ia - csm ( sn  2002ic : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 91t - like ( sn  1991 t : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 91bg - like ( sn  1991bg : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and type iip ( sn  1999em : * ? ? ?",
    "all of the light curves are normalized such that their peak magnitude is zero , in order to highlight the difference of their shapes .",
    "we find that the light curves of kepler s sn ( both european and korean versions ) are clearly distinct from that of sn  2002ic ( ia - csm ) , showing that there was no massive csm in close proximity to the progenitor ( @xmath140.01pc ) .",
    "this assertion would be fairly robust , given that both of the two independent historical light curves , generally agreeing with each other within 1 mag , decline quite fast ( @xmath61mag@xmath75 at day@xmath7100 from the maximum light ) , which is in stark contrast to the flat light curves seen for sne ia - csm .",
    "our work strongly suggests that kepler s sn was likely to be a 91t - like event , based on the ejecta abundances  the dominance of ige . since detailed light curves of kepler s sn",
    "were taken by both european and korean observers in a.d.16041605 , it is interesting to ask if these light curves are consistent with those of overluminous sne ia obtained by modern telescopes .",
    "unfortunately , we found it difficult to discriminate the overluminous and subluminous sne ia from the light - curve shapes .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kepler_lc ] , the light curve measured by johannes kepler and some other european is best represented by that of sn  1991 t , whereas the korean version ( red data in fig .",
    "[ fig : kepler_lc ] ) is closer to that of sn  1991bg ( subluminous ) .",
    "this discrepancy probably means that brightness uncertainties from naked - eye measurements are too large to discriminate among sne ia subtypes that follow the light - curve decline rate versus peak luminosity correlation .",
    "another important piece of information from the light curve is the peak brightness . assuming the absolute maximum brightness of kepler s sn to be -19.5 mag , a typical value for 91t - like events , and a visual extinction to be 3.27 mag @xcite",
    ", we estimate the distance to kepler s snr to be either 6.3kpc or 4.5kpc from the apparent maximum brightness ( -2.25 or -2.95 ) reported in europe and korea , respectively .",
    "therefore , the apparent maximum brightness from the korean observations matches our result better .",
    "we should , however , note that the distance of 6.3kpc from european maximum brightness is more consistent with recently preferred value of @xmath76kpc",
    ". given these considerations , the only solid conclusion from the light curve studies is that kepler s sn was different from ia - csm and type iip , but was close to phillips - relation sne ia .",
    "in addition , we confirmed the presence of dense x - ray emitting csm in kepler s snr , and estimated its total mass in the entire remnant to be @xmath70.035m@xmath1 .",
    "this large mass reminds us of the massive csm associated with sne ia - csm .",
    "however , as we discussed above , the light curve is inconsistent with a ia - csm event for kepler s sn , suggesting the different distances between the csm and the progenitor star ; a few pc away from the progenitor for kepler s sn is much farther than those seen in ia - csm events ( @xmath140.01pc ) .",
    "thus , we argue that kepler s sn was likely to be a 91t - like event , and started to interact with the dense csm @xmath11200yrs after the sn explosion .    in this way , kepler s snr has provided us with observational evidence for a recently proposed connection between 91t - like events and ia - csm objects : i.e. , the two ia subclasses are actually the same phenomenon with seeming differences due to different timing of the interaction with a massive csm @xcite .",
    "this speculation was originally inspired by optical observations of sn  2002ic and ptf11kx , whose optical spectra initially resembled a 91t - like template , but started to develop an h@xmath15 line after 22 days and 59 days after explosions , respectively , evolving to more like a type iin template . since the timing of the csm interaction is not unique , we can easily guess a possibility that the timing was too late to show signatures of the csm , as the sne fade after the explosions .",
    "while such sne would be classified as 91t - like events , if we could monitor them for several hundred years , we should be able to detect a signature of a massive csm .",
    "we believe that kepler s sn must be such an example , and speculate that another overluminous ia remnant , snr  0509 - 67.5 , might show strong interaction with a massive csm in the future .",
    "it should be noted that , whereas ia - csm objects occupy only 0.11% of sne ia @xcite , the fraction of 91t - like events is @xmath79% @xcite .",
    "therefore , our result implies that roughly 10% of sne ia are associated with a massive csm .    based on the observational clues obtained so far , we discuss possible progenitor systems for kepler s snr .",
    "first of all , the presence of the csm itself favors the sd scenario .",
    "while some recent dd models predict the existence of csms @xcite , they originate from a h - rich envelope of a he wd or tidal tails from a c / o wd , hence they would not be cno - processed n - rich material .",
    "this is in conflict with the overabundance of n seen in the csm of kepler s snr .",
    "moreover , the small amount of o ejecta , @xmath350.069m@xmath1 as shown in table  [ tab : ejecta_mass ] , is not expected for dd scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but is more consistent with delayed - detonation chandrasekhar - mass models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , there is no observational support for dd channels as the origin of kepler s sn , except for the absence of a candidate surviving companion star @xcite .",
    "outflows from sd progenitors can originate from either the exploding star or the donor star .",
    "for kepler s sn , the former case is less likely than the latter .",
    "this is because the exploding star , which must have experienced a major mass loss @xmath62yrs before the explosion , can not have had sufficient time to evolve to a wd and accrete material from its donor star to near the chandrasekhar mass ( cf . , accretion timescale is of the order of 10@xmath63yrs ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the exploding star is not necessarily a wd  the so - called type 1.5 model predicts that a degenerate c / o core of a massive abg star with very low metallicity grows to near the chandrasekhar mass before it loses its envelope @xcite .",
    "however , such a sn occurs inside a massive h envelope , so that the sn light curve should look like type iip sne as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : kepler_lc ] ( k.maeda et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "looking at fig .  [",
    "fig : kepler_lc ] , this is evidently not the case for kepler s sn . moreover , the fact that the metallicity of kepler s csm is nearly solar ( table  [ tab : csm ] ) also conflicts with the type 1.5 model .",
    "turning to outflows from a companion / donor star , the high mass - loss rate we estimated , @xmath64(@xmath9/10kms@xmath10)m@xmath1yr@xmath10 , suggests an agb companion .",
    "one possible progenitor system hosting an agb companion is a recurrent nova @xcite .",
    "however , there are two major observational facts contrary to the recurrent novae scenario . first , kepler s sn experienced a major mass eruption @xmath62yrs before the sn explosion .",
    "such a long nova timescale is not expected for recurrent nova systems with near chandrasekhar - mass wds , for which typical recurrence times are 10100yrs .",
    "second , according to numerical simulations @xcite , the impact of sn ejecta removes most of the envelope of a companion star if it is a giant like an agb star . as a result",
    ", the surviving companion will evolve away from the red giant branch , along a track of constant luminosity ( @xmath65@xmath66 ) for at least 10@xmath25yrs .",
    "such a bright star , if present , should be easily detected by optical observations , but is not detected at least near the center of the remnant @xcite .",
    "thus , a recurrent nova is not likely the progenitor of kepler s sn , either .",
    "there are other models that satisfy observational properties of kepler s snr , i.e. , both high mass - loss rate and no bright surviving companion . in efforts to explain the progenitor system of sne ia - csm , @xcite investigated the classical supersoft channel that consists of a c / o wd and a main sequence star .",
    "they found that if the donor star is a relatively massive ( @xmath73m@xmath1 ) main sequence star and the system experiences delayed dynamical instabilities , a large amount of mass can be lost from the system in the last few 10@xmath67yrs before the explosion . as a result , the donor star loses most of the mass before the explosion , and its luminosity becomes as low as the sun .",
    "this model can explain both the massive csm and no detectable surviving companion in kepler s snr .",
    "alternatively , @xcite argued that a wd and a hot core of a massive agb star in a common envelope will violently and promptly merge if the wd is denser than the core . in this case , there is no surviving companion left behind the sn while massive a csm could be present near the progenitor system , making this model viable as well .",
    "however , we have not yet found bservational evidence supporting these models , leaving us the mystery of the progenitor system .",
    "continuous searches for a surviving companion and/or signatures of a companion star in kepler s snr would be of great importance for revealing the progenitor of kepler s snr and sne ia in general .",
    "we have analyzed x - ray spectra and images of three young ( @xmath7400yrs old ) , ejecta - dominated snrs , i.e. , kepler s snr , tycho s snr , and snr  0509 - 67.5 in the lmc .",
    "a simple spectral comparison among the three remnants suggests that kepler s snr and snr  0509 - 67.5 produced substantially more ige than tycho s snr .",
    "in fact , we quantitatively revealed that the ige masses for both kepler s snr and snr  0509 - 67.5 are similar to those of overluminous sne ia , while that for tycho s snr is comparable to that of normal sne ia , assuming the total mass of ime and ige to be @xmath71.05m@xmath1 @xcite and inferring the unshocked ejecta masses using the sn ia s nucleosynthetic models together with the reverse shock positions estimated from _",
    "chandra _ images .",
    "this inference is consistent with the fact that snr  0509 - 67.5 and tycho s snr are confirmed remnants of overluminous and normal sne ia explosions , respectively .",
    "therefore , we conclude that kepler s sn was likely an overluminous ( 91t - like ) event .",
    "our method is quite simple , and thus could be a powerful tool for discriminating subclasses of type ia snrs .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ s rgs spectrum shows a strong n ly@xmath15 line for kepler s snr .",
    "we measured the n / h abundance to be @xmath74 times the solar value , suggesting the presence of a cno - processed csm as was previously suggested by optical spectroscopy @xcite .",

    "the csm masses are estimated to be @xmath70.3m@xmath1 and @xmath70.035m@xmath1 for the diffuse gas and dense knots , respectively .",
    "the mass of the diffuse csm allows us to infer a mass - loss rate of the progenitor system to be @xmath8(@xmath9/10kms@xmath10)m@xmath1yr@xmath10 , consistent with those of agb stars . as for the knots",
    ", their slow optical proper motions and ionization timescales measured by using x - ray spectra suggest that they were located far away from the progenitor system at the time of sn explosion , and were recently shock heated .",
    "we argue that kepler s sn was likely a 91t - like event that started to interact with massive csms a few hundred years after the explosion .",
    "this supports the possible link between 91t - like sne and sne ia - csm , implying that @xmath710% of sne ia are associated with massive csm .",

    "<S> we have analyzed _ xmm - newton _ </S>",
    "<S> , _ chandra _ , and _ suzaku _ observations of kepler s supernova remnant ( snr ) to investigate the properties of both the sn ejecta and the circumstellar medium ( csm ) . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> we have also analyzed two similarly - aged , ejecta - dominated snrs : tycho s snr , thought to be the remnant of a typical type ia sn , and snr  0509 - 67.5 in the large magellanic cloud , thought to be the remnant of an overluminous ( sn1991t - like ) type ia sn . by simply comparing the x - ray spectra , we find that line intensity ratios of iron - group elements ( ige ) to intermediate - mass elements ( ime ) for kepler s snr and snr  0509 - 67.5 are much higher than those for tycho s snr . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore argue that kepler is the product of an overlumious type ia sn . </S>",
    "<S> this inference is supported by our spectral modeling , which reveals the ige and ime masses respectively to be 0.95@xmath0m@xmath1 and 0.12@xmath2m@xmath1 ( kepler s snr ) , 0.75@xmath3m@xmath1 and 0.34@xmath4m@xmath1 ( snr  0509 - 67.5 ) , and 0.35@xmath5m@xmath1 and 0.70@xmath6m@xmath1 ( tycho s snr ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the csm component in kepler s snr consists of tenuous diffuse gas ( @xmath70.3m@xmath1 ) present throughout the entire remnant , plus dense knots ( @xmath70.035m@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> both of these components have an elevated n abundance ( n / h@xmath74 times the solar value ) , suggesting that they originate from cno - processed material from the progenitor system . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the diffuse csm allows us to infer the pre - sn mass - loss rate of the system to be @xmath8(@xmath9/10kms@xmath10)m@xmath1yr@xmath10 , in general agreement with results from recent hydrodynamical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the dense knots have slow optical proper motions as well as relatively small x - ray  measured ionization timescales , which indicates that they were located a few pc away from the progenitor system and were only recently heated by forward shocks . therefore , we argue that kepler s sn was an overluminous ( 91t - like ) event that started to interact with massive csm a few hundred years after the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> this supports the possible link between 91t - like sne and the so - called  ia - csm \" sne  a rare class of sne ia associated with massive csm . </S>",
    "<S> the link implies that @xmath710% of sne ia are associated with massive csm which most likely originates from a companion star in a single degenerate progenitor system . </S>"
