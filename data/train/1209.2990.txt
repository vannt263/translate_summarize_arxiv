    "as mentioned in the main text , only two lasers @xmath14 , with @xmath191 and @xmath192 used to induce the two - photon raman transition , are needed to generate simultaneously the periodic transverse zeeman term and the 1d optical lattice .",

    "[ p - band ] ) , while these couplings can not lead to additional raman transitions between the ground ( pseudo-)spin-@xmath80 subspace and other ground states since such transitions are associated with large two - photon detunings ( see the experiments ref . [",
    "11 - 15 ] in the main text .",
    "the typical two - photon detuning for such processes is @xmath198mhz , much larger than the raman transition strength which is about @xmath199mhz ) .",
    "therefore the two couplings only lead to additional diagonal optical potentials @xmath200 and @xmath201 for @xmath195 and @xmath16 , respectively .",

    "the edge states of the @xmath238-th chain can be written as @xmath241 and @xmath242 , where @xmath243 is the ground state for the bulk .",
    "an interesting question is what happens if we turn on interactions .",
    "it turns out that in the presence of interactions , the @xmath0 classification breaks down to @xmath1 . to confirm this result",

    "it is straightforward to check that the states @xmath247 and @xmath248 have energy @xmath249 while the states @xmath250 , @xmath251,@xmath252 , and @xmath253 have a higher energy @xmath254 .",
    "then the ground state is two - fold degenerate , as given by @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "second , for @xmath255 , the ground state degeneracy @xmath256 can be reduced to 2 by two - chain interactions according to ( [ 2chain ] ) : @xmath257 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath258 , the two - fold degenerate ground states are @xmath259 and if @xmath260 , the ground states read @xmath261 where @xmath262 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that above interaction is identical to a summation of two - body interactions and can not split the degeneracy of the ground states .",
    "other possible 3-chain interactions include @xmath263\\\\ & = & v_{123}^{(4)}(2c_{2,s}^\\dag c_{2,s}-1 ) ( c_{1,s}^\\dag c_{3,s}+c_{3,s}^\\dag c_{1,s}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it can be easily checked that in the case ( [ gs3_1 ] ) the perturbation @xmath264 have zero matrix elements in the ground - state subspace and hence can not split the degeneracy .",
    "the condition is similar in another case ( [ gs3_2 ] ) .",
    "the difference is that , in case ( [ gs3_2 ] ) , @xmath264 mixes the ground states with higher energy states .",
    "for instance , the state @xmath265 is mixed with @xmath266 to lower its energy . at the same time",
    "the state @xmath267 is mixed with @xmath268 to lower the energy with the same amount . as a result",
    ", the two new states , as the new ground states , are still degenerate .",
    "therefore , the topological properties of 3 chains are stable against interactions respecting the symmetry , and we need to investigate the 4-chain system .    finally , for @xmath269 , it turns out that we can find a path to smoothly reduce the ground state degeneracy to 1 .",
    "it is easy to verify that degeneracy of the ground states can be reduced to 4 under two - body interaction @xmath270 with @xmath271 .",
    "these four ground states are given by @xmath272 with the energy equal to @xmath273 .",
    "however , the above ground states can be further gapped out by taking into account the following interactions : @xmath274 in the 4-dimensional hilbert space spanned by the ground states in eq .  , the above interaction can be written in the matrix form @xmath275 whose eigenvalues are @xmath276 , and @xmath277 .",
    "we therefore obtain the single non - degenerate ground state with the energy @xmath278 .",
    "this implies that under interaction the 4-chain system can be smoothly connected to a trivial phase without closing the bulk gap , and we therefore complete the proof that the @xmath0 classification can be broken down to @xmath1 under interactions .",
    "we prove in this section that each edge state leads to @xmath80-fractionalization .",
    "a convenient way is to consider the semi - infinite geometry which has the open boundary at @xmath70 .",
    "we then calculate the particle number of the zero mode localized on this boundary .",
    "note the total number of quantum states in the system is given by @xmath279 where we denote by @xmath280 the state number operator and @xmath281 is the eigenstate with energy @xmath282 . since the hamiltonian satisfies @xmath283 ,",
    "the energy spectrum is symmetric .",
    "we have then @xmath284 .",
    "it follows that @xmath285.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the particle number of the zero mode depends on its occupation . if the zero mode is unoccupied , the particle number of it is given by @xmath286.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath287 and @xmath288 represents the cases with one ( topological phase ) and zero ( trivial phase ) bound modes , respectively . using the eq .",
    "one finds directly @xmath289 similarly , if the zero mode is occupied , the particle number is @xmath290 .",
    "it is trivial to know that this result can be applied to the case with two boundaries located far away from each other , say respectively at @xmath70 and @xmath72 .",
    "since the two zero modes are obtained independently , each of them carries @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) particle if it is occupied ( unoccupied ) .",
    "in this section we provide the derivation of the one - loop rg equations . we consider that in hamiltonian   only one zeeman term , e.g. @xmath124 is nonzero ( the case with @xmath291 can be studied in the similar way ) .",
    "we find it convenient to redefine that @xmath40 and rewrite the hamiltonian   in the form : @xmath292 , with @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "the low - energy physics can be well captured by the continuum approximation ( @xmath295 ) : @xmath296 ,    \\label{}\\ ] ] with @xmath297 .",
    "the continuum representation of the two mass terms are then given by : @xmath298 here @xmath299 .",
    "using the standard bosonization formula @xmath300}$ ] with @xmath301 and @xmath302 , we reach the bosonized hamiltonian densities @xmath303    the allowed four - fermion interactions in the ( unperturbed ) hubbard model at half - filling is highly constrained by the @xmath304 symmetry .",
    "it is convenient to define current operators : @xmath305 here @xmath306 is the fully anti - symmetric tensor .",
    "the general form of four - fermion interaction is given by @xmath307 we then derive the rg flow equations to understand the fate of the topological phase transition driven by the competition of the staggered zeeman term and the spin - orbit coupling term .",
    "the tree level term can be easily read off from the scaling dimensions of @xmath308 and @xmath309 in their bosonization form  , both of which are @xmath310 .",
    "so it is necessary to go to the next order in the perturbative expansion .",
    "the one - loop order rg flow can be most easily derived by calculating the operator algebra of the various operators  @xcite .    to derive the rg equation , we consider the partition function in the euclidean functional integral representation @xmath311 the euclidean action @xmath312 where @xmath313 $ ] is the unperturbed gaussian part and the @xmath314 is the perturbation . to perform the rg ,",
    "we expand the exponential to the second order in @xmath315 .",
    "let us write @xmath316 .",
    "then the second order term is given by @xmath317 we have introduced complex coordinates @xmath318 where @xmath319 . here",
    "we assume the following operator product expansion ( ope ) @xmath320 which is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "the opes are valid when two points @xmath17 and @xmath254 are brought close together , as replacement within correlation functions .    at this point",
    "the cutoff prescription needs to be carefully specified .",
    "we will choose a short - distance cutoff @xmath39 in space , but none in imaginary time .",
    "for a rescaling factor @xmath321 , we must then perform the integral @xmath322 eq . then becomes @xmath323 upon re - exponentiating we obtain the one - loop rg equation @xmath324 here @xmath325 .",
    "now let us be more specifit .",

    "is the maximum value of @xmath333 and it has @xmath334 . ]",
    "the appearance of the edge modes localized in the boundary between trivial insulating and topological insulating regions is protected by the nontrivial winding number in the bulk , and is independent of the details of the boundary .",
    "the different configurations of the mass domain walls may at most quantitatively affect the coupling between the localized edge spins , as numerically shown in fig .",
