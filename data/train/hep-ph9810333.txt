    "the standard model  @xcite of the electroweak interactions predicts a mixing of the quark mass eigenstates with the weak interaction ones .",
    "this mixing is described by the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa@xcite ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "four real parameters describe this @xmath7 unitary matrix  @xcite : @xmath8 as @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are of order unity , and @xmath12 is chosen as the sine of the cabibbo angle , this parametrisation shows immediately the hierarchy of the couplings of the quarks in the charged current part of the standard model lagrangian .",
    "moreover in this parametrisation the parameter @xmath11 is the complex phase of the matrix and is thus directly related to the known violation of the cp symmetry produced by the weak interactions .",
    "the measurement of the parameters of the ckm matrix is thus of fundamental importance for both the precision description of the weak interaction of quarks and the investigation of the mechanism of cp violation .",
    "the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath12 are known with an accuracy of a few percent and the determination of @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the subject of this letter .",
    "a large number of physical processes can be parametrised in terms of the values of the elements of the ckm matrix , together with other parameters of theoretical and experimental origin .",
    "four of them show good sensitivity for the indirect determination of @xmath10 and @xmath11 and are discussed in what follows .",
    "a fit based on this information has been performed , as suggested in  @xcite , and its results are presented below .    as it is well known",
    "the measurement of @xmath10 and @xmath11 is equivalent to the determination of the only unknown vertex and the angles of a triangle in the @xmath13 plane whose other two vertices are in ( 0,0 ) and ( 1,0 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows this triangle , called the unitarity triangle .",
    "the value of the sine of the cabibbo angle is known with a good accuracy  @xcite as : @xmath14 the parameter @xmath9 depends on @xmath12 and on the ckm matrix element @xmath15 . using the value  @xcite : @xmath16",
    "it can be extracted : @xmath17        the mass eigenstates of the neutral kaons can be written as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the relation @xmath20 implies the violation of cp that , in the wu - yang phase convention  @xcite , is described by the parameter @xmath21 defined as : @xmath22 the precise measurements of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 decay rates imply  @xcite : @xmath25 the relation of @xmath26 to the ckm matrix parameters is  @xcite : @xmath27 .",

    "the heavy and light mass eigenstates , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , are different from the cp eigenstates @xmath0 and @xmath44 : @xmath45 is the key feature of the physics while the lifetime difference dominates the effects in the neutral kaon system .",
    "this mass difference can be measured by means of the study of the oscillations of one cp eigenstate into the other .",
    "the high precision world average is  @xcite : @xmath46 the relation of @xmath47 with the ckm parameters , making use of the standard model description of the box diagrams that give rise to the mixing and the parametrisation  ( [ equation : ckm ] ) of the ckm matrix , reads : @xmath48 .",

    "their larger mass difference @xmath55 is responsible for oscillations that are faster than the @xmath0 ones , and have thus still eluded direct observation .",
    "a lower limit has been set by the lep b oscillation working group combining the results of the searches performed by the lep experiments with a contribution from the sld and cdf collaborations , as  @xcite : @xmath56    the expression for @xmath55 in the standard model is similar to that for @xmath47 . from the ratio of these two expressions the value of @xmath55 can be written as : @xmath57 where all the theoretical uncertainties are included in the quantity @xmath58 , known as  @xcite : @xmath59        the three constraints described above are all affected by a large theoretical uncertainty on some of the parameters that enter their expression , namely @xmath37 , @xmath51 and @xmath58 . a determination of either @xmath2 or the ratio @xmath60 allows a more sensitive constraint not relaying on any non - perturbative qcd calculation .",
