    "the instantaneous collapse of a two - particle quantum state vector has no covariant meaning , since the time - ordering of two different measurements depends on the reference frame for spatially separated events . in order to analyze this problem in a concrete situation , it is convenient to study entanglement from a relativistic point of view @xcite .",
    "this analysis is also important for the study of relativistic quantum infomation tasks @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we analyze the entanglement change , after a lorentz boost , of a system composed by two spin - one massive particles in an epr - like situation @xcite .",
    "we compare our results with similar analyses done by friis et al . , and jordan et al . , for spin-@xmath0 particles @xcite . as well as these authors ,",
    "we consider the particle s momentum as a discrete two - level variable , and calculate the entanglement change , with respect to different decompositions of the hilbert space , caused by a lorentz boost in a fixed direction .",
    "we address the question of the dependence of the entanglement change on the initial spin entanglement and argue that , instead of the initial entanglement , quantum superposition plays the key role in the initial entanglement - final entanglement relation .",
    "we focus on initial spin states for which no entanglement change occurs at all , and show that , for the situation under study , such states form a complete basis of the two - particle spin hilbert space . within this basis , maximally entangled invariant states , interesting for quantum information purposes , are explicitly obtained . on the other hand , since there are elements of this basis that suffer a distinct global phase change under the boost , an arbitrary linear combination of them will _ not _ in general be lorentz - invariant .",
    "we generalize our results to higher spins .    in section [ two ]",
    "we introduce , for the sake of competeness , the relativistic transformation of momentum and spin states , while section [ three ] gives a description of the problem under study .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section [ four ] , where we also show the existence of a complete set of invariant states the two - particle spin space .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ five ] .",
    "in this section we present the relativistic transformation of a single - particle state with momentum and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "we use units such that @xmath1 .",
    "the four - momentum of a particle in its own rest frame is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the rest mass of the particle .",
    "we label the four - vector components with the set of indices @xmath4 , and use boldface letters to denote three - vectors .",
    "the quantum state of the particle in the rest frame is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "this state has a well - defined linear four - momentum , @xmath6 , and a well - defined spin projection along the @xmath7-axis , @xmath8 . in our case , @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the standard lorentz boost that takes the rest frame four - momentum @xmath6 to the four - momentum @xmath11 .",
    "the four - momentum eigenstates are defined in terms of the rest - frame state and the standard boosts as follows @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a unitary representation of the poincar group on the complete momentum - spin hilbert space .",
    "these states form a complete set and satisfy @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath16-th component of the four - momentum operator , and @xmath17 stands for the @xmath16-th component of @xmath11 . + now consider an arbitrary lorentz transformation @xmath18 .",
    "the action of @xmath18 on the four - momentum eigenstate @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 here we have defined the wigner rotation as @xmath21 it is clear that @xmath22 is a pure rotation , since it leaves the four - momentum @xmath6 invariant : @xmath23 . the rotation angle @xmath24 , called the wigner angle , is a function of the magnitudes of the rapidities @xmath25 and @xmath26 that define , respectively , the boosts @xmath27 and @xmath18 , and under a suitable choice of setting ( see below ) may be written as @xcite : @xmath28 thus , under an arbitrary lorentz transformation @xmath18 , the momentum is changed from @xmath11 to @xmath29 and the spin part of the state transforms under the action of the rotation group , since , by the definition of the four - momentum eigenstates ( eq.([deffinition ] ) ) , the spin label remains unchanged after the standard boost @xmath30 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a spin-@xmath33 representation of the rotation group . in our case ,",
    "@xmath33 = 1 .",
    "we consider an epr - like situation with two spin-1 particles propagating in opposite directions with respect to each other , and compare the entanglement of the system before and after a lorentz boost on the state .",
    "we take the direction of propagation to be the @xmath7-axis .",
    "one of the particles is supposed to be under control of one observer , alice , while the other is supposed to be under control of another spatially separated observer , bob .",
    "the entanglement is calculated with respect to different partitions of the complete hilbert space , which is a tensor product of alice s and bob s hilbert spaces .",
    "each of the single - particle spaces is composed by spin and momentum degrees of freedom , so that the complete hilbert space can be written as a tensor product of four physically distinct subspaces : @xmath34 here , the superscrips @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote alice and bob subsystems , while the subscripts @xmath11 and @xmath37 denote the momentum and spin degrees of freedom , respectively . following @xcite , we calculate the entanglement change of the state , after a lorentz boost , with respect to three different partitions of @xmath38 : _ i ) _ the @xmath39 vs. @xmath40 partition , that is , the partition formed by alice s and bob s subsystems ; _ ii ) _ the @xmath11 vs. @xmath37 partition , obtained by tracing over the momentum or spin degrees of freedom of the whole state in @xmath38 ; and _ iii ) _ the entanglement change with respect to the partition formed by one given subspace opposed to the other three ; we shall call this the @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 partition .",
    "we choose the initial state @xmath43 to be a pure and separable state in @xmath11 and @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "furthemore , we consider only sharp - momentum distributions , i.e. states where the momentum of each particle is concentrated around a definite value that can be @xmath47 , for propagation along the positive direction of the z - axis , and @xmath48 , for propagation along the opposite direction . for a study of wave packets in the spin @xmath0 case ,",
    "see @xcite , while a wave packet analysis for the photonic case may be found in @xcite . the states in this work are considered to be normalized in the sense that @xmath49 , where the subscripts @xmath50 and @xmath33 can stand for the momentum labels @xmath51 and @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the usual kronecker delta @xcite .",
    "if the lorentz transformation @xmath18 of eq.([transformation ] ) were a pure rotation , then the associated wigner rotation would not depend on the momentum of the particles and would therefore have no effect on the entanglement of the states .",
    "furthermore , since every lorentz transformation can be decomposed into a pure rotation and a pure boost , and pure rotations have no effect on entanglement , we consider in what follows the transformations @xmath18 to be pure boosts . on the other hand , we see from eq.([wigner rotation ] ) that if the lorentz boost @xmath18 is along the direction of propagation of the particles , which we take to be the @xmath7-axis , then the wigner rotation becomes the identity transformation , and causes no change in entanglement .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we can choose the boost @xmath18 to be along the @xmath54-axis , perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the particles . in this seting ,",
    "the spin - one representation of the wigner rotation takes the form @xmath55 where @xmath24 is given by eq .",
    "( [ wigner angle ] ) .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the state obtained from the original state @xmath43 after the lorentz transformation @xmath57 , i.e. , @xmath58 is the state described by an observer that is transformed with @xmath59 with respect to the observer that describes the state with @xmath43 .",
    "the initial entanglement calculated from @xmath60 is to be compared with that obtained from @xmath61 . as an entanglement measure",
    ", we use the linear entropy , defined by @xmath62 where the reduced density matrix @xmath63 is obtained from the original density matrix @xmath64 by tracing over all subsystems except the @xmath50-th .",
    "note that the way a state transforms is independent of the entanglement measure chosen , and we shall see that weakly- or not - entangled states can transform into maximally entangled ones , so that if @xmath65 is not lorentz - invariant nor will any other appropriate entanglement measure be . as @xmath65 is a simpler measure to calculate , we choose to work with this measure ( for a whole family of entanglement measures the reader may see @xcite ) .",
    "for the initial state ( [ initial state ] ) we choose a family of states @xmath66 and @xmath67 parametrized as follows ( this reduces to the parametrization found in @xcite for the case of spin-@xmath0 particles ) : @xmath68    [ spin state ] @xmath69    the three spin parametrizations cover the eigenstates of the operator @xmath70 in the composite hilbert space for definite values of the parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "in this section we analize the entanglement change for each of the partitions of the complete hilbert space .      in agreement with @xcite ,",
    "entanglement is conserved for all states with respect to the @xmath39 vs. @xmath40 partition , due to the unitarity of the transformation induced in each of the subspaces @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "that is , since we have @xmath76 , where @xmath77 acts on the @xmath39 subsystem and @xmath78 on the @xmath40 subsystem , then @xmath79 and the linear entropy defined in eq .",
    "( [ linear entropy ] ) remains unchanged when we trace out the @xmath39 or @xmath40 degrees of freedom .",
    "physically , the unitary character of the @xmath57 transformation and the resulting conservation of entanglement is very important , since it is a necesary condition for the results of local measurements to depend , for _ every _ reference frame , only on the information given by the partial states @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "if entanglement failed to be conserved in this case , there would exist different quantum correlations for different inertial observers , in contradiction with the principle of relativity . in this way ,",
    "every physical process that involves quantum correlations , such as quantum telportation , is independent of the reference frame in which it is analyzed and the experimental results will be the same for every observer .",
    "entanglement with respect to the @xmath11 vs. @xmath37 partiton _ is not _",
    "conserved in the general case .",
    "this is because of the dependence of the wigner rotation on the momentum of the particle .",
    "if we have an initial momentum superposition , then we have different transformations for the spin part of the system , one for each value of the momentum .",
    "thus , the spin part of the system transforms according to a superposition of wigner rotations , and the resulting transformed state is no longer a tensor product of spin and momentum states . on the other hand , if the initial momentum state is not a superposition , which means @xmath82 or @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ momentum state ] ) , there is only one wigner rotation for the state ; therefore , in this case , the resulting transformed state differs from the original one only by a unitary transformation , which laves the entanglement of the system unchanged .    the change in linear entropy depends strongly on the wigner angle , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ par1partspmax ] . in this figure",
    "we plot the entanglement change @xmath84 as a function of @xmath85 and @xmath86 for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "we have chosen values of @xmath24 that differ considerably to stress the effect that this parameter has on the shape of the surface .",
    "when both the speed of the particles and the speed of the boost @xmath18 approach the speed of light we have @xmath87 .",
    "interestingly , in the limit of the speed of light ( @xmath87 ) , the entanglement change of the spin state given by eq .",
    "( [ parametrization 1 ] ) produces exactly the same function of @xmath71 and @xmath72 as that obtained by friis et al in @xcite for the spin-@xmath0 composite state @xmath88 . in both parts of fig .",
    "[ par1partspmax ] there are minima that correspond to the maximally entangled state @xmath89 .    in all cases ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath90 on the parameter @xmath91 is merely a change of scale , which is zero for non - superposed momentum states and is maximal for the initial momentum state @xmath92 .",
    "for this reason , in what follows we consider only the case @xmath93 without loss of generality .",
    "it is important to point out that the entanglement change is due to the linear superposition of initial momentum states and not due to the entnglement of the initial state @xmath94 . to see this ,",
    "let us start with the separable state @xmath95 .",
    "this state is not of the form of eq .",
    "( [ momentum state ] ) but we use it here for the sake of argument . with this choice of initial momentum superposition , any state of the form @xmath96 , with @xmath67 being an arbitrary initial spin state , transforms into @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the transformation induced by the boost in the two - particle spin subspace",
    "when the first particle has momentum @xmath11 and the second has momentum @xmath99 .",
    "this final state is entangled in the spin and momentum degrees of freedom since , in general , the transformations on spin space @xmath100 and @xmath101 are not equal .",

    "the minima of the surface correspond to the bell - type state @xmath103 , which undergoes no entropy change for this particular wigner angle . when the parametrization given by eq .",
    "( [ parametrization 3 ] ) is used ( figure [ par2partspograndemax ] ( right ) ) it is possible to generate entanglement for a large number of states under a lorentz transformation with the same wigner angle of @xmath104 .",
    "here we have used @xmath105 .",
    "the invariant state ( minima of plot ) is @xmath106 .",

    ", we take the state given in eq .",
    "( [ parametrization 1 ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ par1part1 ] we show the entanglement change , as a function of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , for the values values of @xmath107 and @xmath87 .",
    "when the wigner angle equals @xmath108 , i.e.small \" velocities , the entanglement change is maximum for the state @xmath109 , while the states @xmath110 and @xmath111 correspond to local maxima . above on the right of fig .",
    "[ par1part1 ] is shown the same function as that on the left side but turned upside down , in order to look at the minima .",
    "such minima correspond to the maximally entangled states @xmath112 . in spite that for this partition both of these states conserve entanglement for all values of the wigner angle , only the state @xmath113 is invariant under transformations of the form @xmath114 , that are , as we will show later , the kind of maps induced on the spin space by the lorentz boost . in this notation",
    ", @xmath115 stands for the transformation given by eq .",
    "( [ spin 1 rotation ] ) and acts on the @xmath116 subspace .",
    "this invariance appears more clearly when we consider the @xmath11 vs. @xmath37 partition , in which @xmath113 has zero entanglement change for all values of @xmath24 , but @xmath117 _ does _ generate a change in entanglement for some values of the wigner angle .    on the other hand , for @xmath87 ( fig .",
    "[ par1part1 ] , below ) , the states @xmath118 and @xmath119 have a maximal change in linear entropy , while the state @xmath120 stays now at the bottom of the plot .",
    "we see , thus , how the velocity of the particles , as well as the rapidity of the lorentz boost , play an important role in the entanglement change of the state .    for the second parametrization , given in eq .",
    "( [ parametrization 2 ] ) , the linear entropy behaves in a similar way as in the first parametrization . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ par2part1max ] , the states @xmath121 and @xmath122 , have a smaller entanglement change than the state @xmath120 for a wigner angle of @xmath102 .",
    "we know from the last case that @xmath120 has a maximum entanglemet change for @xmath107 . as the wigner angle approaches @xmath123 , the change in linear entropy corresponding to the initial spin state @xmath120 decreases , while that corresponding to @xmath124 and @xmath125 increases continuously .",
    "finally , in the limit of the speed of light , @xmath126 , the change in linear entropy corresponding to the state @xmath120 vanishes ( as we already know from the previous section ) , and the states @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( both with momentum part given by eq .",
    "( [ momentum state ] ) with @xmath93 ) become , after the lorentz boost , maximally entangled states with respect to the @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 partition . it is interesting to note that the state @xmath127 is invariant under the maps induced by the lorentz boost studied here , as is the case of the state @xmath128 studied in the last section . both of these spin states are maximally entangled and , as they remain unchanged under the lorentz transformations presented here , they are interesting for quantum information purposes in an epr - like relativistic framework .      in the physical situation considered here the boost direction is kept fixed and the particles momenta are always opposite in relation to each other ( and given by sharp distributions ) .",
    "these two facts imply the that there exists a complete set of states in the two - particle spin hilbert space such that , for each state in this set , the action of the lorentz boost is merely a multiplication by a global phase factor .",
    "to see this , first we note that the wigner rotation for a single particle is restricted to be an element of @xmath129 , the rotation group in the plane , since a fixed boost direction implies a fixed axis of rotation .",
    "moreover , since the momenta of the particles are always opposite , by eq .",
    "( [ wigner angle ] ) the angle of rotation for one particle will be of the same magnitude but opposite sign as that of the other particle .",
    "then , the transformation on the two - particle spin space induced by the lorentz transformation will be of the form @xmath130 .",
    "now we show that the set @xmath131 forms a representation of @xmath129 .",
    "the product of two elements @xmath132 and @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath129 is given by the sum of the parameters that define these elements @xmath135 thus , @xmath136 which proves our claim .",
    "since the representations of @xmath129 are completely reducible we can , by means of a change of basis , reduce the transformation @xmath137 , for any @xmath24 , in terms of the irreducible representations of @xmath129 , which are of the form @xmath138 , with @xmath139 . for spin - one systems",
    ", the transformation @xmath137 takes the form @xmath140 therefore , each element of the basis which diagonalizes @xmath141 changes under a lorentz boost only by a global phase factor . in this sense",
    ", such states may be called invariant under the kind of lorentz boosts considered in this work ( always perpendicular to the momenta of the particles ) .",
    "moreover , entanglement is conserved for every linear combination of states that transform under the same irreducible representation of @xmath129 , and all the information about the entanglement change of an arbitrary state is kept in the relative phase factors @xmath138 .    for particles with arbitrary spin , the transformation @xmath141 is also diagonal .",
    "the multiplicity @xmath142 of a given irreducible representation @xmath143 , that is , the number of times this representation appears in the ( reducible ) representation element @xmath141 , can be calculated as @xcite : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the order of the group @xmath146 , @xmath147 is the character of the element @xmath148 for an arbitrary representation , and @xmath149 is the character of the element @xmath150 for the irreducible representation labeled by @xmath3 .",

    "the entanglement with respect to the @xmath39 vs. @xmath40 partition is invariant under a lorentz transformation .",
    "this fact is a direct consequence of the unitarity of the transformation @xmath76 .",
    "the conservation of this kind of entanglement is fundamental for the consistency between quantum - mechanical predictions and relativistic transformations .",
    "on the other hand , entanglement is not conserved neither for the @xmath11 vs. @xmath37 partition nor for the @xmath41 vs. @xmath42 partition .",
    "this is due to the momentum - dependence of the wigner rotation , which induces , for momentum - superposed initial states , different transformations for different particles .",

    "the dependence of the linear entropy change with respect to the initial spin state and to the wigner angle @xmath24 is more interesting . generally , the states for which the entanglement change is greater are separable spin states , while this quantity remains constant ( normally ) for states with maximal entanglement .",
    "however , the initial spin entanglement is not a crucial factor regarding the entanglement change after a lorentz boost , since we can find separable spin states which conserve entanglement with respect to all partitions and all values of the wigner angle . in the same way",

    "in particular , the spin states that are invariant under this type of transformations conserve entanglement for every partition and all values of the wigner angle , with no regard to the initial momentum state .",
    "since the action of the group @xmath129 is reducible in the spin state space , we can find an orthonormal basis of this space such that each state in the basis transforms , under a lorentz boost , only by multiplication of a factor of the form @xmath138 . in this basis",

    "this result can be generalized to systems of arbitrary spin @xmath33 so that , in principle , invariant subspaces of an arbitrary dimension can be constructed , considering the adequate type of particles .",
