    "comparative studies of the scaling relations in clusters of galaxies reveal strong deviations of the observed relations from predictions based on self - similar collapse , e.g. the observations show a steeper @xmath1 relation than predicted by the self - similar laws ( kaiser 1986 ) .",
    "these deviations are thought to be best characterized by the injection of energy ( preheating ) into the gas before clusters collapse ( kaiser 1991 ; evrard & henry 1991 ) .",
    "recently , an analysis of a large compilation of entropy profiles on groups and clusters of galaxies also required at @xmath2 much larger entropy levels than was thought before ( finoguenov et al .",

    "reproduction of these results both analytically and numerically , strongly supports the scenario of dos santos & dore ( 2002 ) , where an initial adiabatic state of the infalling gas is further modified by the accretion shock ( voit & ponman 2003 ) . as a supporting evidence to the latter , ponman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) noticed a self - similarity in the entropy profiles , once scaled to @xmath4 .",
    "some xmm - newton observations are consistent with this result ( pratt & arnaud 2003 ) .",
    "a major change introduced by these studies is that groups of galaxies can again be viewed as scaled - down versions of clusters , yet the scaling itself is modified .",
    "other evidence for the departure of groups from the trends seen in clusters , such as the slope of the @xmath5 relation , has been recently refuted by osmond & ponman ( 2004 ) .",
    "the idea of this _ contribution _ is to check the consistency between the data and both the concept and the level of the modified entropy scaling .",
    "while we give an overview of the results here , the details of the data analysis could be found in zhang et al .",

    "their final group list contains 109 systems .    the reflex - dxl galaxy cluster sample , comprising * d*istant * x*-ray * l*uminous objects within reflex , was constructed from the reflex galaxy cluster survey covering the rosat detected galaxy clusters above a flux limit of @xmath7 erg s@xmath8 @xmath9 in the 0.1 to 2.4 kev band in an 4.24 ster region of the southern sky ( see bhringer et al .",

    "in addition to these two samples , we have added some of the published work on the nearby clusters , a754 ( henry et al .",

    "addition of these data allows us to demonstrate to which extent the scaling works at low redshift .    at the moment a number of prescriptions exists on how to scale the cluster properties and look for their evolution ( e.g. voit 2004 ) .",

    "[ fin0 ] ]    a suggested modified entropy scaling of psf reads @xmath16 .",
    "we also take into account that to fit the clusters hotter than 5 kev , the normalization of this relation should be 20% lower . in fig.[fin0 ] we illustrate this issue by performing the locally - weighted pseudo - non - parametric analysis ( for further insights and references , see sanderson et al .",
    "2004 ) . while this is done here to properly reproduce the mean entropy of the clusters , observed previously , a glitch in the @xmath15 ( and @xmath17 ) relation implied by such an approach , will be studied elsewhere . in the following",
    "we will use the entropies measured at @xmath2 for a 10 kev systems and apply scaling with @xmath18 .",
    "in addition to the scaling of the entropy and a fixed fraction of virial radius , we adopt a radial behavior of the entropy as @xmath19 , which for the local sample has been shown to work outside the @xmath20 ( pratt et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in the analysis of clusters , we will also present the scaled pressure plots .",

    "we introduce a correction for the evolution of the critical density , which is proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "introduction of the correction for the evolution of the critical density to either pressure or entropy is appropriate only if the shock heating of the accreted gas is the dominant mechanism defining the thermodynamics of the icm and the resulting agreement of the data with the local scaling confirms the major role of the shock heating in establishing the entropy and pressure profiles for clusters . a sample of high - redshift groups would be needed to extend this conclusion to groups .",
    "as we are not aware of any prescription for the pressure , in this _ contribution _ we use the fit to a478 data and discuss whether it is representative . including the prescription for the scaling of the pressure with the average cluster temperature , the pressure model , implied by the a478 data reads as @xmath27 ergs @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , we adopt a factor of 1.5 lower pressure normalization for systems with temperatures less than 5 kev in concordance with the entropy scaling .",
    "the pressure within the central @xmath29 in clusters with on - going mergers ( most remarkably a3558 and a3266 ) lies below our pressure model .",
