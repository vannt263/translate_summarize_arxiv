    "motivated by these studies , the goal of the present manuscript is to analyze different networks with hierarchical connectivity and systematically explore the mechanisms of formation of chimera states in such networks .",

    "the parameter  @xmath13 denotes the coupling strength , and @xmath14 is the number of links for each node ( corresponding to the row sum of @xmath3 ) .",
    "the local interaction is realized as diffusive coupling with local coupling matrix @xmath15 and real interaction parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in accordance with omelchenko et",
    "@xcite , throughout the manuscript we fix parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which allows us to observe chimera states in nonlocally coupled systems .",
    "hierarchical topologies can be generated using a classical cantor construction algorithm for a fractal set@xcite .",
    "this iterative hierarchical procedure starts from a _ base pattern _ or initiation string @xmath20 of length @xmath21 , where each element represents either a link ( @xmath22 ) or a gap ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the number of links contained in @xmath20 is referred to as @xmath24 . in each iterative step , each link is replaced by the initial base pattern , while each gap is replaced by @xmath21 gaps .",
    "thus , each iteration increases the size of the final bit pattern , such that after @xmath25 iterations the total length is @xmath26 . since the hierarchy is truncated at a finite @xmath25 , we call the resulting pattern hierarchical rather than fractal . using the resulting string as the fundamental row of the circulant adjacency matrix @xmath3 ,",
    "a ring network of @xmath26 nodes with hierarchical topology is generated @xcite .",
    "here we will slightly modify this procedure by adding an additional zero in the first instance of the sequence , which corresponds to the self - coupling .",
    "note that the diffusive coupling scheme in eq.([eqn : gen1 ] ) cancels out any instantaneous self - coupling .",
    "therefore there is no net effect of the diagonal elements of the adjacency matrix @xmath27 on the network dynamics , and hence the first link in the clockwise sense from the reference node is effectively removed from the link pattern . without our modification",
    ", this would lead to a breaking of the base pattern symmetry , i.e. , if the base pattern is symmetric , the resulting coupling topology would not be so , since the first link to the right is missing from the final link pattern .",
    "our procedure , in contrast , ensures the preservation of an initial symmetry of @xmath20 in the final link pattern , which is crucial for the observation of chimera states , since asymmetric coupling leads to a drift of the chimera @xcite .",
    "thus a ring network of @xmath28 nodes is generated .",
    "while fully hierarchical topologies can be generated using this classical construction algorithm , a further modification allows us to study systematically the transition between nonlocal and hierarchical topologies via a stepwise iteration process .",
    "nonlocal coupling schemes have widely been used in the context of chimera state research  @xcite and do therefore provide a good reference point to compare hierarchical networks to .",
    "a nonlocal topology can be generated from a base pattern @xmath20 of length @xmath21 , which contains an equal number of links only at its beginning and end ( for instance ( @xmath29 ) or ( @xmath30 ) ) .",
    "the link pattern is then expanded to a predetermined system size @xmath28 , corresponding to the final size of a fully hierarchical topology , by replacing each element with @xmath31 copies of itself and again adding the additional zero in first instance of the final pattern .",
    "thus , a suitable base pattern @xmath20 can be used to either construct a fully hierarchical or a nonlocal topology . the stepwise transition between these two types of topologies",
    "is realized as follows : first , @xmath20 is iterated @xmath32 times according to the cantor construction process , generating a pattern of size @xmath33 .",
    "afterwards , this pattern is expanded to the final size @xmath2 by replacing each element with @xmath34 copies of itself .",
    "the initial base pattern @xmath35 and a predetermined system size of @xmath36 @xmath37 provide a simple example .",
    "the resulting coupling topologies are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdpmod2 ] . the number of cantor iterations of @xmath21 _ before _ the expansion is defined as the the @xmath38 hierarchical step , with @xmath39 such that    * @xmath40=(@xmath29 ) , the initial base pattern is expanded to a 1-step hierarchical topology by replacing each element with @xmath41 copies of itself .",
    "this corresponds to nonlocal coupling with coupling radius @xmath42 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : vdpmod2](a ) . *",
    "@xmath43=(@xmath44 ) , the once iterated initial base pattern is expanded to a @xmath45step hierarchical topology by replacing each element with @xmath46 copies of itself .",
    "this marks the first step in the transition from a nonlocal @xmath47 to a fully hierarchical @xmath48 topology .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : vdpmod2](b ) .",
    "* @xmath49=(@xmath50 ) , this link pattern is of size @xmath2 for @xmath51 and corresponds to the fully hierarchical or @xmath52step hierarchical topology . see fig .",
    "[ fig : vdpmod2](c ) .",
    "thus , taking up to @xmath53 steps in the hierarchical expansion it is possible to tune a suitable initial base pattern between a nonlocal and a fully hierarchical topology . in the following ,",
    "an @xmath54step hierarchical topology is denoted as @xmath55 , where @xmath20 is the underlying base pattern , @xmath25 the level of hierarchy and @xmath32 the hierarchical step in a transition topology .       for networks with topologies varied stepwise from nonlocal to hierarchical for different base patterns ( see legend ) .",
    "the hierarchical step @xmath56 is used to tune between nonlocal coupling and fully hierarchical coupling . at higher hierarchical step",
    "@xmath32 the clustering coefficients decreases due to the disproportional increase of gaps versus links in the base pattern . non - compact base patterns lead to vanishing clustering coefficients @xmath57 .",
    "this suppresses chimera states in hierarchical networks generated from these base patterns .",
    "system sizes ( n=4 ) : @xmath58 for @xmath59 , @xmath60 for @xmath61 , @xmath62 for @xmath63 . ]    besides the bifurcation parameter @xmath8 and the coupling strength @xmath13 , the topological quantities @xmath20 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and the resulting link density @xmath64 and fractal dimension @xmath65 are important parameters in the study of chimera states in hierarchical systems . however , since there are several distributions of links for a given set of @xmath21 and @xmath24 that result in unique topological structures , the arrangement of links in @xmath20 has to be accounted for .",
    "therefore , we propose to consider the local clustering coefficient introduced by watts and strogatz  @xcite , which , for a directed graph * * g**=@xmath66 containing a set of nodes @xmath67 and edges @xmath68 , describes the number of links in the neighbourhood @xmath69 relative to the maximum number of links possible . since a directed graph distinguishes between @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the maximum number of links is given by @xmath72 and the clustering coefficient @xmath73 for a node @xmath74 is defined as @xmath75        while common nonlocal coupling schemes can rely on the coupling range ( or variations thereof @xcite ) as a definite measure , this is not the case in hierarchically coupled networks .",
    "different arrangement of links change",
    "the compactness of the base pattern and the final compactness of the system strongly depends on the distribution properties of the @xmath24 links in a base pattern @xmath20 .",
    "the clustering coefficient is such a suitable measure since it directly expresses the compactness of links in the final system . in the following @xmath76",
    "denotes the clustering coefficient of an @xmath54step hierarchical topology with base pattern @xmath20 . in the transition scenario from nonlocal to hierarchical topologies ,",
    "the system size and the symmetry properties stay the same throughout .",
    "however , each hierarchical step modifies the compactness and total number of links of the final topology which changes the clustering coefficient @xmath57 as well as the link density @xmath77 .",
    "since hierarchical coupling introduces irregular and long - ranging links and gaps , the clustering coefficient will decrease when transiting towards a hierarchical topology .",
    "+ out of all the @xmath78 possible base patterns for a given length @xmath21 , only a fraction is relevant for discussion in the context of hierarchical networks .",
    "for example , mirror symmetric base patterns ( such as ( @xmath79 ) and ( @xmath80 ) ) result in topologies with identical clustering coefficients , while patterns containing only one link would result in a network with only a single link to each node . in the case of @xmath61 , out of @xmath81",
    "possible patterns , only @xmath82 will yield unique hierarchical topologies . fig .  [",
    "fig : cc1 ] demonstrates clustering coefficients @xmath76 as a function of the hierarchical step @xmath32 for a selected number of representative base patterns .",
    "these results provide an instructive overview over the dependence of @xmath57 upon @xmath32 .",
    "as expected , the clustering coefficients decrease across - the - board when introducing hierarchical components . with each step",
    "@xmath32 , the number of gaps increases disproportionally compared to the number of links , since each gap in @xmath20 introduces @xmath21 new gaps with each iteration , while each link only leads to @xmath24 new links and adds @xmath83 further gaps .",
    "thus , the link density decreases with each iteration of @xmath32 and the remaining links are distributed in a more irregular , hierarchical manner .",
    "a close analysis of @xmath57 with respect to the underlying base pattern shows that base patterns with gaps at either the end or the beginning of @xmath20 ( such as ( @xmath84 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : cc1 ] , red dots ) result in low clustering coefficients , compared to systems of equal link density but different distribution ( such as ( @xmath30 ) , orange squares ) .",
    "furthermore , isolated links in @xmath20 ( such as ( @xmath85 ) , yellow squares ) further decrease @xmath86 compared to topologies constructed from more compact base patterns ( such as ( @xmath30 ) , orange squares )",
    ". however , more compact base patterns @xmath20 that have isolated links ( such as ( @xmath87 ) , blue circles ) _ can have _ larger @xmath86 , as compared to topologies with same number of links but without isolated links ( such as ( @xmath84 ) , red dots ) .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that isolated links lead to far - ranging links rather than coupling to those nodes in their close neighbourhood . considering the choice of suitable base patterns @xmath20 for the construction of hierarchical topologies which exhibit chimeras",
    ", it should be noted that base patterns with larger clustering coefficients are preferable .",
    "therefore , base patterns should be chosen avoiding isolated links , gaps at the beginning or end , and with compact intervals , if possible .",
    "this highlights the basic trade - off when studying hierarchical topologies .",
    "compactness is an important requirement for the existence of chimera states and at the same time , networks are less compact if they are more hierarchically structured . if one wants to study dynamic phenomena and maintain a hierarchical topology , this has to be balanced in a careful manner , since low @xmath25 decreases the actual degree of hierarchy of the system , while large @xmath25 produces highly hierarchical systems ( fractal , in the case of @xmath88 ) but with very low compactness .",
    "it will be shown in the following that hierarchical topologies resulting from base patterns that contain only isolated links for given @xmath21 and @xmath24 have the lowest clustering coefficient and hence the smallest probability of exhibiting chimera states .",
    "the simplest illustrative example of a hierarchical topology is constructed from the base pattern @xmath89 .",
    "we consider this pattern in order to demonstrate the step - by - step transition from nonlocal to hierarchical network topology with @xmath90 . at the initial step @xmath91 , the system is a nonlocally coupled ring with @xmath92 and coupling radius @xmath93 . the clustering coefficient for this topology is @xmath94 .",
    "this system has been studied in  @xcite , where is was shown that depending on the coupling radius and strength , chimera states with different numbers of incoherent domains can be observed . indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : chimdec1](a ) shows a @xmath45chimera state .",
    "snapshots of the variable @xmath95 ( upper panels ) demonstrate a clear distinction between coherent and incoherent domains , snapshots in the phase space @xmath96 ( bottom panels ) show that the oscillators are scattered around the limit cycle of the uncoupled element which is shown in black .",
    "the middle panels demonstrate the mean phase velocities for each oscillator calculated as @xmath97 @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the number of complete rotations around the origin performed by the @xmath100th node during the time interval @xmath101 . throughout the paper ,",
    "we use @xmath102 , which corresponds to several thousand periods .",
    "mean phase velocity profiles are widely used as a criterion to distinguish chimera states : constant @xmath103 corresponds to coherent domains , where neighbouring elements are phase - locked .",
    "arc - like parts of the profiles correspond to incoherent domains .",
    "+ usually , chimera states with different numbers of incoherent domains exhibit high multistability  @xcite , and the choice of initial condition is crucial .",
    "that is why we use specially prepared chimera - like initial conditions , as in  @xcite , fig .",
    "1(b ) . + the @xmath45step hierarchical network ( fig .",
    "[ fig : chimdec1](b ) ) is characterized by a smaller clustering coefficient @xmath104 , and we observe an @xmath105chimera state .",
    "this fact can be explained by drawing the analogy to nonlocally coupled systems , where a decrease of the coupling radius ( the number of neighbours coupled to each element ) results in an increase of the number of incoherent domains , i.e. , the chimera multiplicity .",
    "already for the @xmath106step hierarchical network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chimdec1](c ) , the chimera state vanishes and is not observed for any further iterations up to @xmath107 .",
    "this goes along with a decrease of the clustering coefficient to @xmath108 and further down to @xmath109 for the fully hierarchical network ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cc1 ] ) . transiting the system from a nonlocal to a hierarchical",
    "topology decreases the clustering coefficient as well as the total number of links to such an extent that chimera states do not occur after only @xmath110 out of @xmath111 possible hierarchical steps .",
    "figure [ fig : chimdec2 ] depicts a similar stepwise transition from nonlocal to hierarchical coupling for the symmetric base pattern @xmath112 with @xmath113 , which has the same fractal dimension and link density but larger clustering coefficients .",
    "the total system size is @xmath60 and the clustering coefficients are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cc1 ] ( orange squares ) .",
    "for @xmath91 we again observe a @xmath45chimera , like in fig .",
    "[ fig : chimdec1](a ) . at @xmath114 ,",
    "the multiplicity of the chimera increases to a @xmath115chimera which remains stable for further hierarchical steps , and is characterized by a more pronounced @xmath103 profile at the fully hierarchical level @xmath116 .",
    "+ the importance of the clustering coefficient as a measure for hierarchical systems with respect to chimera states is further highlighted by considering several permutations of this base pattern of length @xmath61 , and @xmath113 .",
    "we have performed a multitude of scans over wide ranges in ( @xmath117)-space , for various less symmetric base patterns and varying initial conditions ( specially prepared chimera - like as well as random ) , but none of them resulted in a chimera state . among them are topologies with the same @xmath118 but different link distributions and lower clustering coefficients , such as @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , but also systems with larger link densities and clustering coefficients @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "each base pattern at fixed hierarchical step has a fixed relative coupling radius , i.e. , ratio between number of links for each element and size @xmath2 of the system . usually , intermediate values of the relative coupling radius promote chimera states , whereas at the same time for small and large relative coupling radius chimeras are rarely observable .",
    "the subtle interplay of symmetry and compactness of the network topology with the number of links crucially affects the network dynamics .",
    "moreover , due to multistability , the choice of initial conditions usually plays an important role .",
    "while it is impossible to draw a definite conclusion from purely empirical studies , this strongly suggests that generally the combination of a symmetric base pattern with large clustering coefficient promotes the existence of chimera states in hierarchical topologies .",
    "to elaborate the role of the system parameters we construct the maps of stability regimes in the plane of the nonlinearity paremeter  @xmath8 of the individial oscillators , and the coupling strength  @xmath13 . for this purpose",
    "we choose a system with base pattern @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and consider its @xmath106step and @xmath126step hierarchical topology .",
    "we start from specially prepared chimera - like initial conditions for a fixed parameter set , and then use the obtained final state as an initial condition for the subsequent set of parameters , and so forth with a step size @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",

    "[ fig : dynm3](b ) ) .",
    "thus the transition from coherence to incoherence occurs through chimera states .",
    "furthermore , the boundaries between the cohererent regime and the chimera state as well as between the chimera state and the completely incoherent regime shift to larger @xmath8 with increasing @xmath13 .",
    "( [ eqn : gen1 ] ) shows that an upscaling of the local parameter @xmath8 has to be counterbalanced by the coupling strength term which is controlled by @xmath13 in order to lead to a similar force for each oscillator .",
    "notably , the boundaries for chimera emergence in the ( @xmath117 ) plane are approximately given by straight lines .",
    "in the right panel of figure [ fig : dynm3](b ) the mean phase velocity profiles are shown for the three selected points a , b , c in the ( @xmath117 ) plane . the chimera state in b shows",

    "as discussed in the previous section , we have observed only chimera states with @xmath130 incoherent domains . for systems with nonlocal coupling topology",
    "we have shown recently that an appropriate choice of the coupling radius determines the multiplicity of the incoherent regions in chimera states , but there may be multistability between different multi - chimera states  @xcite .",

    "it is remarkable that the regime of chimera states in hierarchical networks ( figs .",
    "[ fig : dynm3 ] , [ fig : dynm4 ] ) extends to much larger values of the coupling strength @xmath13 than has been found for nonlocal coupling @xcite .",
    "this indicates that quasi - fractal connectivities promote chimeras at large coupling strength where in more compact topologies completely coherent states prevail .",
    "changing the size , symmetry and number of links in the base pattern b@xmath131 can lead to various completely different hierarchical topologies .",
    "this strongly influences the resulting clustering coefficient and the link density of the final system .",
