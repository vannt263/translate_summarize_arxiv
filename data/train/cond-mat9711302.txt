    "it is known that quenched disorder can strongly affect the large - scale , long - time behaviour of nonequilibrium driven systems with interacting constituents .",
    "the interplay of disorder , interactions and drive opens up the possibility of new regimes of complex and interesting behaviour arising in these systems @xcite . in the theoretical effort to delineate and explore regimes of new behaviour , an important role is played by simple models which capture some features of more complex physical systems . in this paper , we study disordered driven diffusive systems by analysing stochastically evolving lattice gas models , with quenched disordered hopping rates @xcite",
    ".    driven diffusive systems in the absence of disorder have been studied extensively and are reviewed in @xcite .",
    "also , systems with disorder and drive but no interactions between particles are well studied and understood @xcite .",
    "but there have been only sporadic studies of disordered driven diffusive systems of interacting particles .",
    "it has been argued that strong enough random site dilution can substantially affect the transport properties of particles with hard - core interactions , and can make the system respond nonmonotonically to the driving field @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a low concentration of blocked sites was found numerically not to affect the critical behaviour of a driven lattice gas with additional attractive inter - particle interactions @xcite .",
    "finally , a driven lattice gas with a quenched noise distribution was studied using field - theoretic techniques in @xcite , but the connection of this study with particle - conserving disordered lattice gas models is not clear .    in this paper , we study disordered lattice gas models with a view towards identifying different sorts of generic behaviour that can arise on large scales as a consequence of disorder .",
    "the only interaction included is the hard - core constraint which limits the allowed occupancy of each site .",
    "our results pertain mostly , but not exclusively , to one dimension . in the remainder of this introduction",
    ", we discuss the different types of behaviour displayed by the lattice gas models under study .",
    "we find three distinct regimes in disordered driven diffusive systems in one dimension :    in the _ homogeneous _ regime , the state of the system is characterized by a single density and a nonzero current .",
    "quenched disorder induces variations of the density on the microscopic scale , of the order of a few lattice spacings .",
    "however , the system has a macroscopically homogeneous density . in the thermodynamic limit , the current approaches a finite value .    in the _ segregated - density _ regime ,",
    "the state of the system is characterized by two distinct values of density , and a nonzero current .",
    "besides microscopic - scale variations of the density , there are macroscopic regions with differing high and low densities . the state is thus characterized by phase separation of the density , and a spatially constant time - averaged current which remains finite in the thermodynamic limit .    in the _ vanishing - current _ regime ,",
    "the state of the system is characterized by two distinct values of the density , and an essentially zero current .",
    "the hallmark of this regime is that the current decreases as the system size increases , and vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is a consequence of rare but rate - limiting backbends , or stretches of bonds which disfavour the forward flow of current .",
    "the density is inhomogeneous on a macroscopic scale .",
    "the density profiles in typical states in each of the three regimes are depicted in figure 1 , while figure 2 shows the variation of the current with system size in the three cases .",
    "examples of these behaviours are discussed in this paper for two types of lattice - gas models , namely the disordered drop - push process ( ddpp ) and the disordered asymmetric simple exclusion process ( dasep ) .",
    "the models are defined in detail in sections [ sec : ddpp ] and [ sec : dasep ] respectively , but for the purpose of discussion here , it suffices to note that the models are similar in that there is a maximum occupancy of each site in both , and are different in the dynamical moves  attempted nearest neighbour jumps in the dasep , and slightly longer - ranged leapfrogging moves in the ddpp .",
    "the absence of detailed balance , together with the breaking of translational invariance , in disordered off - equilibrium systems makes the characterization of even the stationary state difficult in general .",
    "it is shown that the steady state of the disordered drop - push process can be found explicitly  the first such instance we are aware of , in a system with disorder , interactions and drive @xcite .",
    "this determination  which is based on the condition of pairwise balance @xcite  shows that a product measure form is valid in all dimensions .",
    "the form reflects the microscopic inhomogeneities coming from the underlying disorder , and results in a macroscopically homogeneous state .    for the disordered asymmetric exclusion process , the steady state measure is not analytically characterizable , and we study the problem within a site - wise inhomogeneous mean - field theory and by numerical simulation .",
    "the result depends crucially on whether or not the system has backbends , which are stretches of the lattice where the local bias is against the particle flow . in the no - backbend case , when the average particle density is sufficiently away from 1/2 , the spatial profile of the density has microscopic shocks , but is uniform on macroscopic scales ( fig .  [ fig : regimes1]a ) .",
    "however , in a finite region around half - filling , disorder induces phase separation into macroscopic regions of high and low density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : regimes1]b ) .",
    "we give approximate arguments to understand the origin and nature of this phase separation , and to obtain the form of the phase diagram in the current - density plane .",
    "this sort of behaviour has also been seen earlier in a model with a single weak bond @xcite .",
    "we argue that disorder - induced phase separation is a generic feature of systems in which the current @xmath1 versus density @xmath2 shows a maximum at some intermediate density , in the absence of disorder .    in the version of the dasep in which the easy direction of hopping is itself a quenched random variable , the model represents a system of hard - core particles in a random potential with an overall downward tilt , but with backbends of arbitrary length .",
    "long backbends severely limit the maximum current that can flow through the system , and in fact the current decreases to zero as the system size increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : regimes2 ] ) ; the system is in the vanishing - current regime .",
    "although our emphasis in this paper is on the analysis of lattice models , we comment briefly on certain constraints that are important in a continuum description .",
    "such a description is expected to be valid for the large - scale , long - time behaviour , and is based on stochastic differential equations involving appropriate coarse - grained variables .",
    "it is argued that quenched randomness is manifest in random multiplicative coefficients in a gradient expansion .",
    "conservation of particle number  which implies spatial constancy of the current in the steady state  imposes strong constraints on these terms .    in one dimension , using a well known mapping @xcite ,",
    "the particle models are equivalent to stochastic growth models of a 1-@xmath0 interface moving in a 2-@xmath0 medium .",
    "the interface moves with a speed proportional to the current in the particle model .",
    "the disordered jump rates now become local growth rates which are disordered in a columnar fashion for the moving interface @xcite .",
    "the three principal regimes of behaviour discussed above for the particle models translate into distinct regimes for interface motion , namely ( i ) a moving interface with normal roughness , ( ii ) a moving interface with large segments with different mean slopes , and ( iii ) an interface with different - slope segments , which is stationary in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : ddpp ] we define and discuss the steady state properties of the disordered drop - push process in arbitrary dimensionality .",
    "the disordered asymmetric exclusion process with only forward - easy - direction of hopping , but quenched random rates , is discussed in section [ sec : dasep ] ; the case in which there are some backward - easy - direction bonds is discussed in section [ sec : sinai ] . in section [ sec : continuum ] we discuss the constraints on a continuum description , while section [ sec : height ] discusses the implications of our results for models interface growth in the presence of columnar disorder . section [ sec : conclusion ] is the conclusion .",
    "the drop - push process was initially introduced in @xcite as a model of activated flow involving transport through a series of traps of equal depths .",
    "the dynamics consists of activated hops together with a cascade of overflows following each move .",
    "the disordered version of the model may be considered as a discrete model of activated fluid flow down an inclined rugged slope with lakes of varying depths ; see figs .",
    "[ fig : lakes],[fig : ddpp-1d ] .",
    "this is similar to above - threshold behaviour of the model considered in @xcite . in this section",
    "we show that the steady state and current can be found exactly in all dimensions for the ddpp and its generalizations .      the model in @xmath0-dimensions",
    "is defined on a hypercubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions along all the @xmath0 axes ( with unit vectors \\{@xmath3 } ) . at each site @xmath4",

    "the configuration @xmath7 of the system is specified by specifying the set of occupation numbers \\{@xmath8 } with ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "further , with each site @xmath4 is assigned a set \\{@xmath10 } of positive random numbers chosen from some given distribution @xcite .",
    "the dynamics is stochastic . in a time interval @xmath11 , with a probability @xmath12 ,",
    "the topmost particle in the well @xmath4 hops out , and drops into well @xmath13 , i.e. into the adjacent well in the @xmath14th direction .",
    "here @xmath15 are a set of site - independent positive numbers satisfying @xmath16 .",
    "now , if well @xmath13 is already full , then the particle gets pushed further _ preserving the direction of the initial jump _ to the next site and so on .",
    "the cascade of transfers terminates once a partially full well is encountered .",
    "note that here the set of jump - rates \\{@xmath17 } are site - dependent as well as functions of the occupation numbers .",
    "these rates , together with the well - depths \\{@xmath5 } , constitute the quenched random variables in the model .",
    "the set of probabilities \\{@xmath18 } determines the direction of the global bias @xmath19 and , as will be shown in section [ sub : imddpp ] , also the direction and magnitude of the steady state current in the model .",
    "however , they do not enter the expression for the normalized invariant measure .    though all the results we will discuss holds for any arbitrary choice of the @xmath20 s , in a physical system they should be determined from the details of the trapping mechanisms etc .",
    ", e.g. they may be taken to be of the kramers form @xmath21 $ ] for situations where the jumps are activated @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the probability @xmath22 for the system to be in configuration @xmath23 is given by the master equation @xcite @xmath24 here the @xmath25 s are the transition matrix elements identified with the rates @xmath20 s defined in the model .",
    "e.g. if the transition @xmath26 involves moving the topmost of the @xmath27 particles at @xmath4 to @xmath28 along the @xmath29th direction , then @xmath30 .",
    "the steady - state or the invariant measure of the dynamics is the set of time independent weights @xmath31 satisfying ( [ eq : master ] ) above .",
    "hence the problem of finding the invariant measure reduces to that of finding a set of positive weights @xmath31 such that the total incoming flux into any configuration @xmath32 ( the first sum in ( [ eq : master ] ) ) equals the total flux out of @xmath32 ( the second sum in ( [ eq : master ] ) ) .",
    "the uniqueness of the invariant measure is ensured by the connectedness property of the @xmath25-matrix , i.e. every configuration can be reached from any other by a sequence of transitions @xcite .",
    "we claim that the ( unnormalized ) measure of configuration @xmath33 in the steady state has the product form @xmath34 here @xmath35 are the single - site weights defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 with @xmath38 being a microscopic rate .    to show that ( [ eq : imddpp ] ) is indeed the invariant measure for the ddpp",
    "we show that it is possible to associate configuration @xmath39 in one - to - one correspondence with every @xmath40 obtained from @xmath41 by an elementary transition such that @xmath42 the above is the condition of _ pairwise balance _ @xcite which ensures that the terms in the two sums on the right hand side of ( [ eq : master ] ) cancel in pairs .",
    "pairwise balance has been used earlier to find steady states of translationally invariant systems @xcite .",
    "we now see that it can be used effectively to deduce the steady state of a disordered system as well .",
    "suppose the transition @xmath26 involves hopping a particle at site @xmath4 to a site @xmath43 with all wells in between along the @xmath29th axis full ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pwb-2d ] ) .",
    "also suppose the well @xmath44 is not full but all wells between @xmath45 and @xmath4 are full .",
    "the configuration @xmath39 is constructed such that it is identical to @xmath23 at all sites except at the sites @xmath45 and @xmath4 , at which @xmath46 . with @xmath39",
    "thus defined , the pairwise balance condition ( [ eq : pwb ] ) @xmath47 reduces to @xmath48 since @xmath23 and @xmath39 differ only at the sites @xmath45 and @xmath4 . as can be explicitly checked , condition ( [ eq : pwb - check ] )",
    "is satisfied in view of the form of the weights @xmath49 .",
    "the prescription above ensures one - to - one correspondence between configurations @xmath39 and @xmath26 transitions .",
    "in the limit of large @xmath50 we use the grand canonical description and write the normalized probability of configuration @xmath7 in the steady state as @xmath51 where the site generating functions are given by @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the number of particles in the configuration . here",

    "we write the current @xmath61 in the bond @xmath62 as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the probability that site @xmath59 has occupancy @xmath65 .",
    "note that the product form of the measure ( [ eq : imddpp ] ) has been exploited to write the above expression with decoupled joint probabilities .",
    "it is cumbersome , and not very instructive , to perform the sum in ( [ eq : ji - i1 ] ) to obtain the current in a closed form .",
    "instead we use the spatial constancy of the current in the steady state to arrive at the result .",
    "we note that in the above expression the first term represents contribution of jumps originating from site @xmath66 to the left of site @xmath59 with all sites in between full .",
    "the second sum represents jumps from the site @xmath59 itself contributing to @xmath61 .",

    "the quantity within square brackets [ @xmath68 is immediately recognised to be @xmath69 by comparing it with ( [ eq : ji - i1 ] ) . physically , this means that all jumps contributing to @xmath69 , for which site @xmath59 is completely full , also contribute to @xmath61 .",
    "hence we have the recursion @xmath70 relating @xmath61 to @xmath69 . now ,",

    "note that the steady - state current does not depend upon the detailed spatial arrangement of wells .",

    "we may consider a generalized version of the drop - push process in which , in addition to the particle moves , independent hole moves are also allowed . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves to the generalized version of the single occupancy ddpp introduced above .",
    "this generalized model may be regarded as the disordered lattice gas analogue of the toom interface dynamics in the low - noise limit @xcite ; see section [ sec : height ] .",
    "the techniques developed for the ddpp may be used to obtain the exact steady - state measure and other quantities such as current and static correlations provided a certain condition [ ( [ eq : constr - gddp ] ) below ] is met .    the model in @xmath0 dimensions",

    "this segregation into high and low density phases , with large shocks separating them , is reminiscent of phase separation , and occurs over the full range of mean particle densities corresponding to regime b. a qualitatively similar phenomenon has been found in a system with one defect bond , studied in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : dasep - jrho ] ) in terms of the macroscopic parameters of the model .",
    "we conjecture that underlying the behaviour of the dasep in different regimes is a maximum current principle : for a given mean density , the system settles into a steady - state which maximizes the stationary current .",
    "such a maximum current principle has been used to describe phase separation in the asymmetric simple exclusion process with open boundary conditions in @xcite .    to use the maximum - current principle to have a qualitative understanding of the phase separation in dasep ,",

    "this approximation is in fact exact in the fully segregated model ( fsm ) discussed in the following subsection .",

    "[ fig : phases - expl ] are the steady - state @xmath168 curves for the two pure reference systems all x and all y. in the disordered system , since the steady - state current has to be spatially constant , the possible densities are given by the four intersections of the line @xmath180 with the two parabolas .",

    "the variation of density between @xmath164 and @xmath186 ( or @xmath187 and @xmath188 ) between x and y stretches corresponds to the ` sub - bands ' seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : dasep - profiles]a ) . on a macroscopic scale , however , the system has uniform density . now consider what happens when the mean density is brought closer to @xmath91 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : phases - expl ] , it is evident that the current would tend to increase , and would eventually reach the maximum allowed value @xmath189 ( which equals @xmath190 in the thermodynamic limit , as argued below ) . as the density is increased further ,",
    "the current remains constant at @xmath189 , in accordance with the maximum current principle , and the excess density is taken care of by converting some of the x stretches of density @xmath164 into ones with @xmath188 ( or vice versa if @xmath191 ) .",
    "this conversion takes place adjacent to the largest stretch of y bonds , leading to two macroscopic regions of different mean densities ",

    "the position of the principal shock separating these regions is at the location of the largest y stretch . in the dasep ,",
    "the assumption of uniform density in each stretch is not really true , on account of the finite length of most of the stretches .",
    "however , the above argument provides a qualitative picture towards understanding the reason for phase separation in the dasep .    .",
    "in a certain respect , the reason for the phase separation in the dasep is similar to that in the single defect bond model studied in @xcite  both have local segments in the system where the maximum allowed current is less than that allowed everywhere else . in the single defect bond model ,",
    "phase separation takes place when the current carried by the rest of the system , with presumed uniform density , is larger than the maximum current allowed through the weak bond . in the dasep , with an extensive number of weak bonds , the _",
    "largest stretch _ of weak bonds acts as the current - limiting segment .",
    "the length of this stretch increases as @xmath194 with system size , and in the thermodynamic limit the maximum allowed current in this stretch is @xmath195  equal to the maximal current in a pure system with only weak bonds .    the essential point leading to phase separation is thus the maximum current principle , coupled with localized current - limiting regions in the system . in the dasep",
    ", this limit is determined by long stretches of weak bonds , and similar considerations should apply in related models .",
    "consequently , we would expect a density - segregated phase in disordered versions of models which , in the absence of disorder , display a maximum in the steady - state current as a function of density .",
    "it is useful to define a model for which many of the approximations made in the previous subsection are actually exact . to this end , we study a fully segregated model ( fsm ) , which is obtained from the binary random model above by arranging all like bonds together .",

    "large stretches of x and y , of lengths @xmath196 and @xmath197 respectively . for the fsm in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "the assumption of uniform density within each stretch is justified , as correlations due to the junctions decay with increasing separation , and may be neglected in the bulk @xcite .",

    "the current equals the maximum possible current in y , namely , @xmath210 .",
    "as @xmath2 is increased further , @xmath209 and @xmath57 remain constant at @xmath91 and @xmath211 respectively .",
    "the density change is adjusted by creating a density inhomogeneity in stretch x. the two densities @xmath212 and @xmath213 are related by @xmath214 so that the currents in the two phases are equal , i.e. @xmath215 .",

    "it is found that @xmath238 grows as @xmath82  implying a roughness exponent @xmath239 .",
    "as discussed at the beginning of section [ sec : dasep ] , the introduction of randomness in the easy direction of individual bonds alters the properties of one - dimensional disordered exclusion process in a crucial way .",
    "we study this in this section .",
    "the model is defined as follows : assign quenched arrows ( pointing either right or left ) independently to each bond of a periodic chain , with probability @xmath240 for left arrows , and @xmath102 for right arrows .",
    "an arrow defines the easy direction of hopping on each bond : a particle - hole exchange across a bond occurs with rate @xmath241 if the particle moves along the direction of the arrow , and @xmath242 if it moves opposite to the arrow . since @xmath240 , there is an overall tendency for particles to circulate rightward , and the question is whether there is a nonzero current even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the model represents a system of hard - core particles in a random potential with a downward tilt .",
    "a conglomeration of left pointing arrows constitutes a backbend , where the potential climbs up before going down again . within mean - field theory",
    "it is possible to obtain an upper bound @xmath243 on the current that can be carried by mutually excluding particles through a backbend of length @xmath244 @xcite . to this end , consider biased diffusion of hard core particles in the segment [ @xmath245 of a 1-d lattice , with the ` optimal ' boundary conditions @xmath246 and @xmath247 ; these boundary conditions force the largest possible current through the segment , opposite to the bias . the master equation that describes transport is invariant under interchange of particles and holes and simultaneous relabelling of sites in reverse order ,",
    "i.e. @xmath248 the boundary conditions respect this symmetry , implying that the steady - state density @xmath249 at site @xmath66 satisfies @xmath250 .",

    "the steady - state profile approaches a step function centered at @xmath253 as @xmath254 .",
    "the current in the steady state is the number of particles crossing site @xmath225 in unit time .",
    "results of a monte carlo study @xcite are consistent with the large-@xmath225 asymptotic behaviour @xmath255 where @xmath256 is a bias - induced length given by @xmath257 .",
    "this can be seen by writing the current within a mean field approximation as @xmath258 , and finding the value of @xmath1 for which the boundary conditions @xmath259 , @xmath260 hold .",
    "for @xmath261,this leads to @xmath262 @xcite , in agreement with ( [ eq : s1 ] ) when @xmath252 is small .",
    "the origin of the factor @xmath263 in the exponent in ( [ eq : s1 ] ) has been discussed in @xcite , and we recount the argument in brief .",
    "the transport of a single particle through the backbend involves two ( approximately ) causally independent steps which occur in parallel : ( i ) the topmost particle ( located at site @xmath264 in large fields ) has to be activated a distance @xmath251 , which requires an activation time @xmath265 and , ( ii ) the consequent hole that remains in the steady - state distribution moves to the bottom and is filled up , by moving each of @xmath251 particles up through a lattice spacing .",
    "the time required is @xmath266 again .",
    "the current @xmath1 is thus proportional to @xmath267 , and consequently follows ( [ eq : s1 ] ) .",
    "since , for fixed @xmath252 , the largest current that can flow through a long backbend ( @xmath268 ) is exponentially small in its length , the largest current through the 1-d lattice of length @xmath50 is determined by the length @xmath269 of the largest backbend encountered .",
    "since the probability of occurrences of @xmath244 consecutive left - pointing arrows on bonds is proportional to @xmath270 , we may estimate @xmath271 from @xmath272 where @xmath273 is a constant of order unity . substituting in ( [ eq : s1 ] ) , we find that the current falls with increasing lattice size as @xmath274 with @xmath275 .",
    "thus the current is expected to decay as a power law in @xmath50 , with a bias - dependent power , and to vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "figure [ fig : jl_sinai ] shows the result of monte carlo simulations .",
    "as with the milder sort of disorder discussed in section iii , the state is strongly inhomogeneous and shows macroscopic regions of high and low density .",
    "figure [ fig : regimes1]c shows the time - averaged density profile for a typical configuration of bonds .",
    "there is a large shock around the rate - limiting backbend , which separates the two regions .    for fixed lattice size @xmath50 with an associated longest backbend @xmath276 ,",
    "the current is a nonmonotonic function of @xmath252 .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "if @xmath252 is low enough that @xmath277 , linear response theory would imply that current @xmath1 grows linearly with @xmath252 . on the other hand , if @xmath252 is large enough that @xmath278 , the current falls with increasing @xmath252 according to ( [ eq : s1 ] ) . in between , @xmath1 achieves a local maximum when @xmath279 , which implies @xmath280 .",
    "the argument given above implies that the current carried by a system of hard - core particles through the randomly backbending lattice vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , no matter how small the bias @xmath252 .",
    "this is in contrast to the behaviour of _ noninteracting _ particles in the same random environment , where the drift velocity vanishes only if the bias is strong enough @xcite .",
    "the difference can be traced to the possibility , in the noninteracting case , of compensation by a large build - up of density at the bottom of a backbend , which then succeeds in driving a finite current over the backbend .",
    "this option does not exist once repulsive hard - core interactions come into play , and the current vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether the behaviours found above in the disordered lattice gases can be reproduced using a continuum description of the problem .",

    "the steady states of a family of disordered models  the disordered drop - push process ( ddpp ) , and related models  have been found in all dimensions by an application of the condition of pairwise balance . the result is a product measure state , with site - dependent weights , reflecting the microscopic disorder in the model .",
    "the current has been computed as well .",
    "the system is characterized by a strictly uniform current density , and a coarse - gained particle density that is approximately uniform . on a macroscopic scale ,",
    "the state is homogeneous .",
    "disorder can lead to macroscopically non - homogeneous states , as in the 1-@xmath0 disordered asymmetric simple exclusion process ( dasep ) .",
    "our numerical and mean - field results show that a macroscopically density - segregated state occurs in the dasep model with no backbends , for densities in a finite range around half - filling .",
    "the origin of density separation is traceable to the existence of a largest current that can be carried by a stretch of weak bonds .",
    "this low current can be sustained in the rest of the lattice only by separating the density into distinct large and small values in macroscopic regions of the lattice .",
    "backbends introduce a third type of possible behaviour in one dimension . like the stretch of weak forward bonds in the density - segregated regime",
    ", a backbend rate - limits the current , leading to density segregation",
    ". however , there is an important difference : the longer the stretch of weak forward bonds , the closer is the current to a finite asymptotic value ; by contrast , the longer the stretch of reverse - biased bonds , the smaller the current  it decreases exponentially fast with backbend length .",
    "since the probability of occurrence of a backbend decreases exponentially with its length , the result is a current that decreases as a bias - dependent power of the overall size of the lattice .    the crucial physical point which underlies the behaviour in each of these regimes is the requirement that the steady - state current be constant at all points in the system .",
    "continuum field - theoretical approaches must ensure that this local constraint is respected ; while this is automatically assured for translationally invariant systems , it may need special care to guarantee in disordered systems .",
    "it would be of interest to generalize our results to higher dimensions and also to include interactions between particles at different sites .",
    "a few scattered results along these lines are available .",
    "( i ) for the drop - push class of problems , we have seen in section [ sec : ddpp ] that the exact steady state even in higher dimensions is characterized by inhomogeneous product measure . on large scales",
    ", this leads to a homogeneous state .",
    "( ii ) the transport of particles with hard - core interactions through the infinite cluster of a randomly diluted lattice above the percolation concentration has been studied @xcite . in a certain regime of dilution ,",
    "backbends act as local traps , but unlike the one - dimensional case considered in section [ sec : sinai ] , there exist infinitely long paths on which the length of every backbend is less than a fixed value @xcite .",
    "the sub - network of such paths is expected to carry a current which then remains finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "there is thus no vanishing - current regime in this system .",
    "( iii ) with attractive interactions between particles , the driven lattice gas system with nearest - neighbour hopping is known to undergo phase separation below a certain temperature @xcite .",
    "a numerical simulation showed that the addition of a low concentration of blocked sites did not alter the critical behaviour of this system @xcite .",
    "more systematic studies of higher - dimensional systems are called for . in particular",
    ", it would be interesting to know whether disorder - induced large - scale inhomogeneities , akin to the phase separation found in one dimension , persist in higher dimensions as well .",
    "acknowledgements : we thank r. e. amritkar , d. dhar , s. krishnamurthy , r. lahiri , g. i. menon and n. trivedi for useful discussions .",
    "in this appendix we discuss two types of symmetry transformations in the dasep which leave the steady - state current invariant .",
    "( i ) the first , which involves flipping the directions of all jumps and interchanging all particles and holes , can be proved exactly . under these operations ,",
    "the steady - state weights of particle configurations and the magnitude of the current are shown to remain invariant .",
    "( ii ) the second type of symmetry is restricted to 1-@xmath0 systems in which only one way jumps are allowed on each bond .",
    "the symmetry transformation consists of flipping the direction of jump on each bond . in this case",
    ", we have convincing numerical evidence that the current is invariant , though there appears to be no simple relationship between steady - state weights of various particle configurations .",
    "we have no general proof of this result .",
    "\\(i ) _ easy direction flip and particle - hole interchange _ : consider the dasep , with quenched disordered , unequal forward and backward hopping rates on each bond .",
    "below we explicitly deal with the one - dimensional case , but the results are easily generalizable to higher dimensions .",
    "let @xmath332 denote a particular realization of disorder and @xmath333 the realization obtained from @xmath332 by flipping the easy direction of jumps on all the bonds : if @xmath332 denotes the set of transition rates \\{@xmath334 } , then @xmath333 corresponds to the set \\{@xmath335}. also , let us denote by @xmath23 and @xmath336 two particle configurations related to each other by particle - hole interchange .",
    "clearly , if @xmath23 is an allowed configuration of the system at filling @xmath2 , then @xmath336 corresponds to a filling @xmath337 , and thus there is a one - to - one correspondence between the configurations at the two fillings .",
    "now , let @xmath338 be the configuration obtained from @xmath23 by exchanging the occupation numbers at the sites @xmath59 and @xmath66 .",
    "it is easy to see that the two transition rates , @xmath339 in realization @xmath332 , and @xmath340 in realization @xmath333 are equal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : phsym ] ) , i.e. the transition matrices @xmath341 and @xmath342 in the two realizations have identical entries .",
    "identification of the two @xmath343-matrices implies that the invariant measures @xmath344 and @xmath345 satisfy @xmath346 using this , together with the identity @xmath347 , we can relate @xmath348-point correlations at fillings @xmath2 and @xmath337 . in particular , the site densities at the two fillings are related as @xmath349 further , the steady - state currents in @xmath332 and @xmath333 at the two fillings are equal in magnitude : @xmath350 the negative sign in the last step reflects the fact that the direction of the current is opposite in the two systems .    in the case of the fsm ( subsection [ sub : fsm ] )",
    "the realizations @xmath332 and @xmath351 are identical ( apart from a reflection ) . hence in this case",
    "the above arguments imply that the magnitudes of the currents at the two fillings @xmath2 and @xmath337 are equal .",
    "a similar result holds for the single defect bond case studied by janowsky and lebowitz @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) _ easy direction flip only ( for 1-@xmath0 , forward hopping ) _ : above , we found that the current is invariant when the filling is changed from @xmath2 to @xmath337 , provided that the disorder realization is changed from @xmath332 to @xmath333 .",
    "here we observe ( based on numerical evidence ) that in 1-@xmath0 , with only forward hopping , the result is also true for realization @xmath332 on its own , i.e. @xmath352 in view of ( [ eq : strong_phsym ] ) this is equivalent to @xmath353 the claim is easily verified for the single particle ( or single hole ) case using an explicit form for the current : @xmath354 @xcite . also , ( [ eq : phsym3 ] ) is true at @xmath154 since ( [ eq : phsym2 ] ) is an identity at this filling .",
    "we do not have a proof for ( [ eq : phsym2 ] ) or ( [ eq : phsym3 ] ) in the general case , but they seem to be borne out numerically . for instance , we studied the validity of ( [ eq : phsym3 ] ) for a system of size @xmath355 with @xmath356 particles .",
    "we took @xmath332 to be the set @xmath357 .",
    "the invariance of the current is verified up to @xmath145 part in @xmath358 .",
    "we also studied the steady - state probabilities of all the @xmath359 particle configurations for each of @xmath332 and @xmath333 , both by monte carlo and by lanczos iteration of the stochastic evolution operator .",
    "there seems to be no straightforward correspondence between the two sets of steady - state weights .",
    "this suggests that there should be a proof of the invariance of the current which does not rely on identifying the weights of individual configurations ."
