    "psr j1119@xmath06127 is a 408-ms pulsar with a large inferred surface magnetic field strength ( @xmath2 g ) which was discovered in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( camilo et al .",
    "2000 ) . a measured @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the pulsar indicates an age of @xmath5 kyr ( assuming an initial spin period @xmath6 ) , making this the youngest pulsar discovered in the survey . despite its similarity in age to the crab pulsar",
    ", psr j1119@xmath06127 has significantly different characteristics , most notably its much larger period and magnetic field .",
    "since it is young , psr j1119@xmath06127 is a good candidate to have an associated supernova remnant ( snr ) and pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "these can be detected and studied using radio imaging .",
    "we have observed the region containing psr j1119@xmath06127 with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) radio interferometer . both 1.4 and 2.5 ghz data were taken using pulsar gating , and data were combined from multiple array configurations .",
    "a 1.4 ghz total intensity map is shown in figure 1 .",
    "a limb - brightened radio shell of @xmath7 diameter is evident , which we call g292.2@xmath00.5 . using a spectral tomography technique to compare the flux in the 1.4 and 2.5 ghz maps ( katz - stone & rudnick 1997",
    "; crawford 2000 ) , we measured a spectral index for the brightest part of the shell of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "off - pulse maps from pulsar gating indicate no detectable pwn emission coincident with the pulsar .",
    "we quantified these upper limits by adding synthetic pwne of varying sizes and fluxes to the data prior to mapping to determine the threshold of detectability .",
    "no polarization information from the observations could be used owing to uncorrectable instrumental leakage from bright nearby hii regions .",
    "the measured @xmath8 for the shell indicates a non - thermal ( synchrotron ) origin for the radio emission , which is expected for a snr .",
    "there is no significant infrared emission coincident with the shell , and the observed spectral index is consistent with those measured for other young shell snrs ( table 1 ) .",
    "we conclude from this evidence that g292.2@xmath00.5 is a previously uncataloged radio shell snr .",
    "the circular , limb - brightened morphology of the snr ( figure 1 ) is expected for a young snr which has not yet been deformed by the interstellar medium ( e.g. , cas a , kepler ) and suggests the snr is young .",
    "the location of psr j1119@xmath06127 at the center of shell is also consistent with an association with the pulsar : the probability of a chance alignment within 1@xmath10 of the shell center is estimated to be @xmath11 . this positional coincidence is also consistent with the youth of the pulsar . if the pulsar were born at the shell center , then the implied transverse velocity is reasonable ( @xmath12 km s@xmath13 ) for a 5 kpc snr distance .",
    "the implied shell size in this case is @xmath14 pc , and for an assumed snr age of @xmath15 kyr , this corresponds to a free expansion velocity of @xmath16 km s@xmath13 .",
    "these @xmath17 and @xmath18 values are consistent with other snr shells of similar age ( table 1 ) . from this evidence ,",
    "we conclude that psr j1119@xmath06127 and snr g292.2@xmath00.5 are physically associated .",
    "we can use the observed upper limits on pwn emission to test an evolutionary model of pwne proposed by bhattacharya ( 1990 ) .",
    "qualitatively , the model suggests that a high - magnetic - field pulsar born spinning rapidly undergoes severe magnetic braking at early times . the bulk of the rotational energy of the pulsar is quickly deposited into the nebula , and the pulsar can not continue to significantly power the pwn at later times .",
    "the pwn rapidly fades from expansion losses and is not detectable at @xmath19 kyr , while the pulsar has slowed to a much longer period .",
    "we have derived a scaling formula for the predicted surface brightness @xmath20 of a pwn powered by psr j1119@xmath06127 which includes many assumptions ( reynolds & chevalier 1984 ; crawford et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) . using this formula ,",
    "we have scaled the observed crab nebula surface brightness to obtain a predicted value for psr j1119@xmath06127 of @xmath21 w m@xmath22 hz@xmath13 sr@xmath13 at 1 ghz , which is well below our sensitivity limits .",
    "there is a strong dependence of @xmath20 on pwn age in the model , and our upper limits indicate that if @xmath23 ms for psr j1119@xmath06127 ( corresponding to @xmath24 kyr ) , the pwn would be detectable in our observations .",
    "the absence of a detectable pwn argues in favor of @xmath25 ms for psr j1119@xmath06127 and supports the evolutionary model of bhattacharya ( 1990 ) .",

    "however , this explanation depends upon the feasibility of a large population of young high - magnetic - field pulsars . a more complete and detailed treatment of the work described here is presented in crawford et al ."
