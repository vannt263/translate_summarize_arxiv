    "the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleons are of fundamental interest in nuclear and particle physics.while the proton form factors have been determined from elastic electron - proton scattering over a wide range of momentum transfers with good accuracy  @xcite , this is not the case for the neutron , since no free neutron targets exist .",

    "however between 50 and 100  mev it follows the data for @xmath2 .",
    "now symmetrizing in addition the final state , pwias , it does not cause a visible change for @xmath1 , but overshoots now the data for @xmath2 for @xmath202 s below about 70  mev .",
    "finally the full calculation leads again to a strong shift and agrees now quite well with the data for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 . at very low @xmath202 s",
    "it now follows the experimental trend for @xmath2 though still misses the error bar of the last data point to the left .",
    "more precise data for @xmath2 , especially in that region would be of interest to quantitatively challenge our present day understanding of final state interactions but possibly also effects related to the choice of the current operator .",
    "though the data show still some scatter for @xmath1 we would like to quantify these results by providing a @xmath205 for @xmath1 :    @xmath206    the sum runs over the six data points .",
    "they are 4.2 , 4.1 , 4.0 , 6.1 , 6.3 , 3.4 for pwia(ps ) , pwia , pwias , pwia , pwias and full , respectively .",
    "the full calculation describes the data best and the correct antisymmetrization and the treatment of the full final state interaction is required to achieve quantitative insight .",
    "note that the often used plane wave impulse approximation , here called pwia is insufficient .",
    "the aim of the experiments were to achieve information on the magnetic neutron form factor .",
    "therefore the influence of the badly known electric form factor of the neutron , @xmath207 , or in our nonrelativistic form @xmath208 should be known .",
    "we restrict our investigation to @xmath1 and in addition to pwia(ps ) and pwias . as an extreme assumption we put @xmath209 to zero , the effect on @xmath1 was negligible ( below 1  % ) .",
    "we expect that this remains true even for the full calculation and therefore we expect that the specific choice of @xmath208 will not influence significantly the extraction of information on @xmath175 from @xmath1 .",
    "we add the remark that this extreme assumption puts @xmath210 for pwia(ps ) , of course .",
    "obviously the data are different from zero and @xmath2 receives contributions from ingredients , which go beyond that most simplistic picture .",
    "this can already be seen comparing pwia(ps ) and pwia in fig .",
    "the difference is just the replacement of the principal s - state @xmath3he wave function by the realistic one .",
    "apparently the s- and d - state pieces contribute very strongly to @xmath2 .",
    "this was noticed before in  @xcite .",
    "being free of that dependence on @xmath208 for @xmath1 , we now altered the neutron magnetic form factor by @xmath211 15 % and @xmath211 30 % and achieved the results , for the full calculation displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . clearly @xmath211",
    "30 % changes lie outside the bulk of the data and also @xmath211 15 % changes are not acceptable given the data .",
    "one can quantify these studies and extract the optimal @xmath212 factor multiplying the neutron magnetic form factor @xmath175 of @xcite such that @xmath213 is minimal .",
    "this study was performed for the full calculation .",
    "we display the resulting @xmath205 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] and extract the optimal @xmath212 factor to be 1 . as a measure of the accuracy of extracting that value we take the spread in @xmath212 for @xmath214 .",
    "this is @xmath211 6.6 % .",
    "clearly more precise data would be very welcome to improve on the accuracy of extracting information on @xmath175 .",
    "the possibly most serious theoretical uncertainty in our analysis is that we do not take mec s into account .",
    "their quantitative contribution remains to be investigated .",
    "it also remains to be seen whether different choices of nn forces could change the results .",
    "for inclusive scattering without polarisation we found only a very weak dependence @xcite .",
    "simplified calculations keeping only @xmath215 nn force components , now for the polarization case , also did not show a dependence on the choice of the nn force .    for future experimental work we would like to propose to separate @xmath216 and @xmath68 .",
    "the sensitivity of @xmath216 to @xmath217 is larger than for the asymmetry @xmath218 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] in comparison to fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] again for the full calculation .",
    "again we quantify that study by evaluating a @xmath219 , defined now as    @xmath220    where @xmath221 runs over the @xmath188-values , in which we carried out the calculations .",
    "we find @xmath222 = 3.1 and @xmath223 = 2.3 .",
    "thus @xmath203 has a stronger dependence on the magnetic neutron form factor ( modified by the strength factor @xmath212 ) than @xmath1 . for the sake of curiosity fig.[fig5 ]",
    "also includes the results putting @xmath224 ( @xmath212=0 ) .",
    "inclusive scattering of polarised electrons on polarised @xmath3he has been evaluated taking the final state interaction fully into account .",
    "realistic nn forces have been used and the 3n bound state and the 3n continuum are evaluated consistently solving the corresponding faddeev equations . a formalism proposed in @xcite , which is ideal for inclusive processes and avoids",
    "the tedious direct integration of over all final state configurations , has been generalized to handle new types of structure functions composed of different current components .    the most simple picture of polarized @xmath3he to be a polarized neutron target fails quantitatively for the energy and momentum transfers considered .",
    "that picture relies on the assumption , that the principal s - state is by far dominant .",
    "this is not at all true for the transverse- longitudinal asymmetry @xmath2 , which receives important contributions from the remaining pieces of the @xmath3he wave function , but also for the transverse asymmetry @xmath1 , where the results change significantly when the principal s - state approximation is replaced by the full and correct @xmath3he wave function .",
    "we also find that the often used plane - wave impulse approximation ( here denoted by pwia ) is insufficient .",
    "in pwia one takes the nn force in the final state into account for the pair of nucleons which are spectators to the single nucleon photon absorption of the third nucleon .",
    "this is quite insufficient for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the correct antisymmetrization of the final 3n continuum is important and above all the final state interaction only all three nucleons ( full calculation ) .    in the full calculation",
    "the data for @xmath1 can be described quite well using the gari - krmpelmann electromagnetic nucleon form factors .",
    "the dependence of that observable @xmath1 on the neutron @xmath169 form factor is weak and unimportant .",
    "we optimized the choice of @xmath175 to the data , with the result that the factor f=1 for the choice of gari - krmpelmann parametrization was best .",
    "this appears to agree with preliminary results achieved in electron scattering on the deuteron@xcite .    in the case of @xmath2",
    "the full calculation shows now the enhancement near the 3n breakup threshold , which is present in the data and which was not provided by the plane wave impulse approximation used up to now .    for both observables",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 more precise data would be very welcome in order to probe the theoretical assumptions more stringently and to extract more accurate information on @xmath175 .",
    "a more thorough investigation of @xmath2 with respect to the contribution of the proton and the @xmath3he wave function component is planned .",
    "because of lack of computer time it could not be included in this study .",
    "we would also like to point out that data for @xmath203 and @xmath68 would be more sensitive to electromagnetic nucleon form factors than the asymmetries . from the theoretical point of view",
    "mesonic exchange currents should be added and the treatment of relativity remains a pending problem .",
    "the authors are indebted to dr . h. gao and dr . c. e. jones for providing the details of their data .",
